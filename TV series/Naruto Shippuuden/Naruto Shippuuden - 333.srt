1
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:09,399
{\an1}You seriously believe that
you can beat me with
Hashirama's Will of Fire?

2
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:15,202
{\an1}Power is not simply will.
Power is only the ability to
make things happen.

3
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,305
{\an1}You're wrong! The will of
the dead reveals its true

4
00:03:18,338 --> 00:03:21,007
{\an1}power in those that
they have left behind!

5
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,309
{\an1}I used that will to develop
my Medical Ninjutsu.

6
00:03:24,342 --> 00:03:26,777
{\an1}From that came Medic
Ninja and Medical Law!

7
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:30,846
{\an1}Rule number one: a Medical
Ninja must never give up on

8
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,848
{\an1}treatment until their patient
draws their dying breath.

9
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:37,984
{\an1}Rule two: A Medical Ninja
shall never go to the front
lines of battle!

10
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:39,885
Rule Three!

11
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:43,554
{\an1}A Medical Ninja should
always be the last of
their platoon to die!

12
00:03:45,422 --> 00:03:47,890
This is what I
teach my students.

13
00:03:48,557 --> 00:03:51,993
{\an1}But there is actually
one more rule...

14
00:03:54,995 --> 00:03:58,296
{\an1}Rule Four says...
A Medical Ninja who
masters the Art of

15
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,999
{\an1}Mitotic Regeneration,
the 100 Healings...

16
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,600
...may break the
first three rules!

17
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:05,400
[gasp]

18
00:04:11,137 --> 00:04:13,540
{\an1}The 100 Healings Jutsu?

19
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:15,474
{\an1}I have never heard of it.

20
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:18,343
{\an1}A Forbidden Jutsu
only for me.

21
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,778
{\an1}It means I'm the only
Medical Ninja allowed
to do battle!

22
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:25,347
{\an1}The Particle Style may have
dissipated the pollen...

23
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,083
{\an1}But one Medical Ninja
won't make a difference.

24
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:30,249
{\an1}Four wasn't working,
so we'll try five!

25
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:33,452
{\an1}Don't you dare think I'm
an ordinary Medical Ninja!

26
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:40,289
{\an7}<i>She's slower than</i>
<i>the Raikage...</i>

27
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,323
Let's go!

28
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,895
{\an8}<i>But her power is</i>
<i>greater than his!</i>

29
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:50,796
{\an8}<i>Fire Style...</i>

30
00:04:51,097 --> 00:04:53,230
{\an7}<i>Majestic Demolisher Flame!</i>

31
00:04:54,198 --> 00:04:55,766
{\an7}<i>Water Style: Water Pillar!</i>

32
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:59,368
{\an7}<i>Water Style! Water</i>
<i>Dragon Missile!</i>

33
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:04,404
{\an1}Weighted Boulder!

34
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,206
Lateral Bolt
of Pain! Chop!

35
00:05:20,115 --> 00:05:23,751
{\an1}I will admit it... undoubtedly
you are not weak, woman.

36
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,251
However...

37
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:30,521
{\an1}If you step in here
and die, all the other
Kage will, as well.

38
00:05:31,521 --> 00:05:33,857
{\an1}Since you're the only one
who's able to heal them.

39
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:36,625
{\an1}That's only if I die.

40
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:42,129
{\an1}Well, Hashirama... I don't
know exactly what it is

41
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:44,162
{\an1}that you've left to
all your followers...

42
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:46,765
{\an1}But this falls short
of your abilities.

43
00:05:46,798 --> 00:05:49,767
{\an4}If you were going to let
your underlings take over,
you should have at least

44
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,002
taught them how
to resurrect you,
as I have done.

45
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:56,370
{\an1}Instead, all that's really
left of you now is just the

46
00:05:56,404 --> 00:05:59,973
{\an1}life force inside of your
cells that yet cling to me.

47
00:06:03,207 --> 00:06:05,243
{\an1}Just as all that's left of
my little brother is the

48
00:06:05,276 --> 00:06:08,311
{\an1}Visual Prowess of
his eyes, now mine.

49
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,946
That's why...

50
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,248
{\an1}That's why you're
completely wrong!

51
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:19,351
{\an1}The only thing that
is ever truly passed
down, of course...

52
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:21,420
...is hatred.

53
00:06:23,387 --> 00:06:26,589
{\an1}What?! Madara was
brought back with the
Reanimation Jutsu?

54
00:06:26,623 --> 00:06:29,525
{\an1}Yes, and now that the real
Madara has shown up,

55
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:32,694
{\an1}the Five Kage had
to step in and stop
messing around!

56
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:36,829
{\an1}And the Hokage, Lady
Tsunade, has joined
the battle as well.

57
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:41,432
{\an1}Huh? Tsunade is Hokage?!
Really?! She became Hokage?!

58
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,667
Did I neglect to
tell you that?

59
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:47,502
{\an1}Well, Lady Tsunade went
through quite a lot after
your passing.

60
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:50,471
{\an1}But in the end, she
did it as a tribute
to you, to show

61
00:06:50,504 --> 00:06:52,338
how much she
cared about you.

62
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:54,574
Tsunade...

63
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:58,209
{\an1}There's no way Lady Tsunade
will lose this one!

64
00:06:58,242 --> 00:07:02,378
{\an1}That's why she's the sole
surviving member of the
Legendary Sannin!

65
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:10,084
{\an7}<i>You're already dead!</i>

66
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,519
{\an8}<i>So, don't spread</i>
<i>any more hatred!</i>

67
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,521
{\an1}Kazekage! Do it now!

68
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:30,030
{\an1}Grand Sand Mausoleum!

69
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:35,133
{\an1}He's been sealed!

70
00:07:35,365 --> 00:07:36,366
All right!

71
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,579
{\an1}The one you sealed away is
a Wood Style Clone just

72
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:58,347
{\an1}like the one that
Hashirama used to use.

73
00:07:58,814 --> 00:08:00,015
{\an1}It was well made...

74
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,585
{\an1}My Visual Prowess made
me the only shinobi to
ever see through...

75
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,252
{\an1}...that powerful ruse.

76
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:09,955
Now then...

77
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:12,923
{\an1}It's over for the
rest of you Kage.

78
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,692
{\an1}Do not underestimate Madara!

79
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:21,129
{\an1}Your only hope of stopping
him is to stop the one who
cast the Reanimation Jutsu.

80
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:25,631
{\an1}Is Madara really that
powerful a shinobi?

81
00:08:25,865 --> 00:08:28,332
{\an1}Even against the Five
Kage facing him?

82
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:32,301
{\an1}Yes! Aside from the late
Lord First Hokage...

83
00:08:32,335 --> 00:08:35,104
{\an1}...there is no one who can
defeat Madara in battle!

84
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,540
{\an1}My guard and my barrier
maintainer should stay!

85
00:08:40,907 --> 00:08:43,642
{\an1}All others should go
after the Reanimation
Jutsu caster!

86
00:08:44,342 --> 00:08:45,877
What has HQ been
doing about it?!

87
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:48,612
{\an1}So far, every effort
has been made...

88
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,148
But we've had no
concrete intel.

89
00:08:56,084 --> 00:08:58,317
{\an7}<i>Don't die... Tsunade!</i>

90
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,090
Summoning Jutsu!

91
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:08,992
Dang!

92
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:11,660
{\an1}I need you to stay here.

93
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:24,202
{\an1}That's it. What a
useless barrier.

94
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:39,811
{\an1}I'm impressed you were able
to pass through my barrier
and find this place.

95
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:43,346
{\an1}Back when you were still
controlling me, I was able

96
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,182
{\an1}to pinpoint where your
chakra was coming from.

97
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:48,917
Yet another risk
of this jutsu.

98
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,152
{\an1}Though you won't survive to
remember for next time.

99
00:09:52,186 --> 00:09:56,922
{\an1}Thank you for the tip. I
wasn't worried because I
didn't think anyone was

100
00:09:56,955 --> 00:10:00,090
{\an1}capable of defying the
jutsu as you have done...

101
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:05,828
Oh, by the way,
there's also something
I'd like you to know.

102
00:10:07,795 --> 00:10:12,299
{\an1}This Reanimation Jutsu
will not come undone
even if you kill me.

103
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:18,502
{\an1}I'm the only one who can
stop it. So, in other words...

104
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,736
{\an1}You cannot simply
destroy me.

105
00:10:21,604 --> 00:10:24,873
{\an1}If you do, you'll never
be able to stop the jutsu.

106
00:10:25,472 --> 00:10:27,774
{\an1}[confident chuckling]

107
00:10:28,108 --> 00:10:34,045
{\an1}[confident laughter] I
guess my luck hasn't run
out quite yet, eh, Itachi?!

108
00:10:34,745 --> 00:10:37,747
{\an1}Things aren't always as we
wish them to be. Damn it...

109
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:41,317
{\an1}I found you! What are
you doing here, Itachi?

110
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:46,220
{\an1}Orochimaru?! But I?!

111
00:10:46,253 --> 00:10:49,588
[chuckle] Close
but not quite...

112
00:10:49,821 --> 00:10:52,090
I know that
voice! Kabuto!

113
00:10:52,756 --> 00:10:55,758
{\an1}That my compensation for
participating in this war

114
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:58,894
{\an1}would show up, on his own,
at this particular moment...

115
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:01,229
I'm so lucky.

116
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,765
{\an1}What do you mean?
What are you two doing,
meeting here?

117
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:11,535
{\an1}It's rather complicated...
But, please. Let me try
to explain.

118
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:16,571
{\an1}Go ahead, and meanwhile...
I'll make you stop the
Reanimation Jutsu.

119
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:22,675
{\an1}This jutsu has neither risks
nor weaknesses. I want you
to understand that, Itachi.

120
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:24,277
{\an1}I already told you once.

121
00:11:24,943 --> 00:11:28,779
{\an1}And besides, even if
you do make a move,
I doubt Sasuke

122
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,380
{\an1}will just quietly
stand back and watch.

123
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:36,851
{\an1}If you rush, you may not
succeed, even if it were
possible, conversely.

124
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:39,853
{\an1}Kabuto, answer my
question now!

125
00:11:40,287 --> 00:11:43,289
{\an1}I guess I have to
tell you, after all.

126
00:11:43,322 --> 00:11:47,490
{\an1}In any event, while you were
asleep, recovering from
having your brother's eyes

127
00:11:47,523 --> 00:11:53,028
{\an1}transplanted into you,
something rather momentous
has happened in our world.

128
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,897
{\an1}You mean that Tobi
started the war, right?

129
00:11:56,163 --> 00:11:59,832
{\an1}So you do know a little
bit, at least. But,
yes, that is true...

130
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:03,001
The Fourth Great
Ninja War...

131
00:12:03,301 --> 00:12:05,669
{\an1}Tobi and I are currently at
war with the coalition of

132
00:12:05,702 --> 00:12:10,705
{\an1}the Nations of Fire,
Wind, Water, Earth,
and Lightning...

133
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:16,542
{\an1}All of which are fighting
together under the name the
"Allied Shinobi Forces."

134
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:20,745
{\an1}There's no way that two of
you can fight against all
the Five Great Nations!

135
00:12:20,778 --> 00:12:23,847
{\an1}Oh, but we can! And that's
just what we're doing!

136
00:12:25,447 --> 00:12:29,484
{\an1}With a hundred thousand
mass-produced White
Zetsu troops!

137
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:33,552
{\an1}Along with them is the
reanimated battalion
I created...

138
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,322
{\an1}Kinkaku and Ginkaku...

139
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:39,757
{\an1}The former members of
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen
of the Mist...

140
00:12:40,557 --> 00:12:42,393
{\an1}The Second Tsuchikage...

141
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:44,526
{\an1}The Third Raikage...

142
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,795
{\an1}The Second Mizukage...

143
00:12:47,296 --> 00:12:48,896
{\an1}The Fourth Kazekage...

144
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:51,598
{\an1}And Madara Uchiha.

145
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:56,501
{\an4}Frankly, I don't have time
to mention everyone. But
your brother over there is

146
00:12:56,534 --> 00:12:59,736
{\an1}also one of the ones
that I've reanimated.

147
00:13:02,138 --> 00:13:02,838
Well?

148
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:05,106
{\an1}Not too shabby, huh?

149
00:13:05,874 --> 00:13:09,976
{\an1}Although to be honest,
Madara Uchiha planned
everything.

150
00:13:10,343 --> 00:13:11,910
{\an1}What do you mean by that?

151
00:13:12,312 --> 00:13:16,479
{\an1}Just like the two of you, he
hated the Shinobi World.

152
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:20,849
{\an1}And so, he came up with
Project Tsuki no Me.

153
00:13:21,482 --> 00:13:22,951
{\an1}Project Tsuki no Me?

154
00:13:24,518 --> 00:13:28,654
{\an1}A plan to cast a powerful
genjutsu over the entire
world using the Ten Tails.

155
00:13:29,121 --> 00:13:31,656
{\an1}And thereby control
the whole world.

156
00:13:33,124 --> 00:13:35,892
{\an1}To achieve that goal, we
need to obtain Naruto's

157
00:13:35,925 --> 00:13:39,561
{\an1}Nine Tails and Killer
Bee's Eight Tails.

158
00:13:40,062 --> 00:13:43,331
{\an1}And just about now...
Madara is causing a ruckus

159
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,832
{\an1}on the battlefield in
order to get them.

160
00:13:46,632 --> 00:13:47,566
Now then...

161
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:50,468
{\an1}...which one of you
should I take down next?

162
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:57,239
{\an1}[determined yell]

163
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,573
[gasp]

164
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:03,943
{\an1}[angry screaming]

165
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:12,514
[grunting]

166
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,220
[gasp]

167
00:14:23,856 --> 00:14:25,757
{\an1}How can you still move?!

168
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:30,294
{\an1}Like I told you, I'm
different! The rules
don't apply to me!

169
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,863
{\an1}Regeneration without
weaving signs...

170
00:14:36,764 --> 00:14:40,532
{\an1}I see... So that is the true
nature of your jutsu that

171
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:43,168
you mentioned in
Rule Four, is it?

172
00:14:43,202 --> 00:14:45,902
{\an1}Just like Hashirama's
ability.

173
00:14:46,404 --> 00:14:49,672
{\an1}I had hoped that I'd be able
to catch you off guard with
this, but...

174
00:14:49,705 --> 00:14:52,807
{\an1}There's no way you can kill
me with my own jutsu.

175
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:54,175
{\an1}Then I'll use mine!

176
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:57,543
Yes!

177
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:02,546
Have you gone
senile, Ohnoki?

178
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,815
{\an1}The Rinnegan can absorb
all jutsu, remember?

179
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:09,517
{\an1}Ninjutsu such as that
will not work against me!

180
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:12,086
{\an1}If you want to kill me,
you need to hit me hard

181
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,821
{\an1}physically, take me
down, and seal me away.

182
00:15:14,855 --> 00:15:16,155
You know that.

183
00:15:16,188 --> 00:15:19,290
{\an1}But my Particle Style
attack from earlier
grazed your chest!

184
00:15:19,324 --> 00:15:22,793
{\an1}There's no way the Atomic
Dismantling Jutsu failed!

185
00:15:22,826 --> 00:15:24,027
Oh, that?

186
00:15:25,594 --> 00:15:28,829
{\an1}I merely wanted to reveal
Hashirama's hidden face to
all of you right then.

187
00:15:28,863 --> 00:15:32,266
{\an1}I was hoping that doing so
would douse your morale...

188
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:35,801
{\an1}But it seems to have done
the opposite and boosted
it instead.

189
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,003
{\an1}I have a question for you.

190
00:15:39,404 --> 00:15:40,971
Mm?

191
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:45,807
{\an1}Yes, it's true that you
outwitted us with the Wood
Style clone that you used...

192
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,510
{\an1}But from another angle,
you could say that we

193
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:50,044
{\an1}managed to corner
you into having to

194
00:15:50,077 --> 00:15:52,278
{\an1}substitute a clone
for yourself.

195
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:53,578
Am I wrong?

196
00:16:02,251 --> 00:16:05,353
{\an1}Well, it is five against
one, after all...

197
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:08,721
{\an1}That's because we must win,
no matter what happens!

198
00:16:08,754 --> 00:16:12,458
{\an1}Now don't go calling us
cowards or saying that
we're being unfair to you!

199
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:15,025
{\an1}In truth, it is merely a
testament to your might!

200
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:18,094
{\an1}You are Madara Uchiha!

201
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:21,263
{\an1}No, I won't call you
cowards, and as for
five to one...

202
00:16:21,562 --> 00:16:23,197
{\an1}It's a nice ratio for games.

203
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:40,008
{\an1}Now it's five-to-one the
other way. And don't say
this is cowardly.

204
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,675
{\an1}You are the Five Kage.

205
00:16:42,576 --> 00:16:45,878
{\an1}And so, I have one
question for you.

206
00:16:46,312 --> 00:16:51,681
{\an1}Would you prefer for all of
these clones to use Susano'o
against you or not?

207
00:16:51,714 --> 00:16:53,483
{\an1}The choice is yours.

208
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:58,387
{\an1}So that's it. That's
the tale of the war.

209
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:04,156
{\an1}There's one thing I don't
get: what's a reanimated
shinobi like you doing here?

210
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,591
{\an1}Your intent to kill is real.

211
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:09,093
{\an1}The answer here is simple...

212
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:11,994
{\an1}I'm not under his
control any longer.

213
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:18,566
{\an1}You're absolutely right.
I must hand it to you,
Itachi Uchiha.

214
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:23,268
{\an1}Imagine, overwriting the
Reanimation Jutsu with
your genjutsu...

215
00:17:23,302 --> 00:17:26,104
{\an1}Most ninja wouldn't
even think of that.

216
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:30,840
{\an1}I'm sorry, but I simply
can't stand taking
orders from others.

217
00:17:31,073 --> 00:17:33,409
{\an1}Yes, well, I agree
with you on that.

218
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:36,477
But you haven't
answered my questions!

219
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,612
{\an1}Sasuke, haven't you learned
yet? Simply asking a
question doesn't guarantee

220
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:42,981
{\an1}that you're going to
receive an answer.

221
00:17:43,482 --> 00:17:45,449
{\an1}You really haven't changed
a bit since the days

222
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:48,017
{\an1}when you were the popular
one at the Academy.

223
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:51,320
{\an1}And what does that mean?
That I'm still persuasive?

224
00:17:51,752 --> 00:17:53,287
Just kidding!

225
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,223
{\an1}Now, don't forget why your
big brother's here...

226
00:17:56,755 --> 00:17:58,823
{\an1}To destroy you, Kabuto.

227
00:17:58,858 --> 00:18:00,125
{\an1}Well, you heard him!

228
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,395
{\an1}Reanimation... You found a
foolish Forbidden Jutsu.

229
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:12,099
{\an1}But as you see, thanks to
this jutsu, you siblings get
to have a touching reunion.

230
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,868
{\an1}I was hoping for a
little more gratitude.

231
00:18:15,268 --> 00:18:18,604
{\an1}The Reanimation Jutsu can't
control what's in the heart.

232
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:22,973
{\an1}You've desecrated souls that
were purified and continue

233
00:18:23,006 --> 00:18:25,874
{\an1}to spread unnecessary
sadness and hate.

234
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:32,479
{\an1}Can you understand the
pain of the dead who
are forced to fight?

235
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,814
{\an1}The pain of the living's
even greater than theirs is.

236
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,517
{\an1}After recovering from their
grief and sadness...

237
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,118
{\an1}...your jutsu has stirred up
those feelings again!

238
00:18:42,485 --> 00:18:43,520
[chuckle]

239
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:45,820
{\an1}I'm really quite surprised...

240
00:18:45,853 --> 00:18:47,555
{\an1}...that someone who
slaughtered the entire

241
00:18:47,588 --> 00:18:51,090
{\an1}Uchiha Clan in cold blood
has such a tender heart.

242
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:56,660
{\an1}So does that mean you
secretly regret what
you did back then?

243
00:18:56,693 --> 00:18:59,028
{\an1}If so, I'm not interested
in the slightest.

244
00:18:59,061 --> 00:19:02,497
{\an1}Say what you want. You
will still die here.

245
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:03,898
Sasuke...

246
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:08,468
{\an1}You want to defeat Itachi,
the bane of the Uchiha,
once again.

247
00:19:08,501 --> 00:19:11,270
{\an1}Since I've recalled him
back to this realm.

248
00:19:11,303 --> 00:19:13,703
{\an1}In short, Itachi, you're
little more than a

249
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:16,739
{\an1}bothersome presence to
both Sasuke and myself.

250
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:23,911
{\an1}Well? What do you say? Shall
we team up and take down
Itachi together, Sasuke?

251
00:19:24,411 --> 00:19:27,946
{\an1}We share the same snake
power and the same Master-

252
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:29,748
{\an1}That "thing" wasn't
my master.

253
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:34,450
{\an1}Besides, it seems you don't
know anything, do you?

254
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:38,853
{\an1}I only came here chasing
after Itachi so that I
could talk to him.

255
00:19:40,488 --> 00:19:44,024
So, then...whose
side are you on?

256
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:50,562
{\an1}Why'd you do that?! He's
just like Orochimaru! Which
makes him my enemy!

257
00:19:51,461 --> 00:19:54,430
{\an1}Right now, he's your
enemy too, isn't he?!

258
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,698
{\an1}I hear you, Sasuke.
And we will talk later.

259
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,900
{\an1}First, we need to
take this one down...

260
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,502
{\an1}But don't kill him.

261
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:08,506
{\an1}If you kill the caster of
the Reanimation Justu, it
can never be undone.

262
00:20:09,372 --> 00:20:12,374
{\an1}First, we'll put him under
my Tsukuyomi, and we'll

263
00:20:12,408 --> 00:20:14,643
{\an1}make him tell us how
to stop this jutsu.

264
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,711
{\an1}While he's under the
Tsukuyomi, I'll control him...

265
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:20,846
{\an1}And I'll break this jutsu.

266
00:20:28,384 --> 00:20:31,786
{\an1}Thanks for the play-by-play.
Hopefully it'll go that
smoothly.

267
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,988
{\an1}But still, as I explained
to you earlier, this jutsu

268
00:20:35,022 --> 00:20:37,723
{\an1}has neither weakness
nor any risks.

269
00:20:38,191 --> 00:20:40,059
{\an1}Every jutsu has a weakness.

270
00:20:40,092 --> 00:20:41,460
Huh?

271
00:20:41,726 --> 00:20:43,328
This jutsu's
weakness and risk...

272
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:46,095
...is simply me.

273
00:20:49,764 --> 00:20:52,667
{\an1}Itachi... you always
kept lying to me...

274
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,469
{\an1}...saying things like "next
time" or "later" and
then died on me...

275
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,439
{\an1}So, this time, for sure...

276
00:21:02,005 --> 00:21:04,007
{\an1}I'm gonna hold you
to your promise.

277
00:21:04,674 --> 00:21:08,977
{\an1}They say you take your
personality to the grave...
I've already died once...

278
00:21:10,944 --> 00:21:12,512
{\an1}I plan to honor it.

279
00:21:12,778 --> 00:21:15,648
{\an1}The estranged brothers
come together to stop me!

280
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:19,149
How exciting!

281
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:58,011
{\an1}<i>Those snakes can sense</i>
<i>exactly where we are.</i>

282
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:03,649
{\an1}<i>Snakes are able to perceive</i>
<i>body heat, and can smell the</i>
<i>air by using their tongues.</i>

283
