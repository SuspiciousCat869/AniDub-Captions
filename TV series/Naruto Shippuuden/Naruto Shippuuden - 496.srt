Hey, Ino, you
here? Come on out.

3
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,772
{\an1}What's up? What are
you two guys doing
here?

4
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:18,408
{\an1}Do you remember what
Kakashi Sensei said?
Our assignment?

5
00:00:18,442 --> 00:00:21,913
{\an1}All right, I'm giving
each of you a secret
mission to prepare a

6
00:00:21,946 --> 00:00:25,250
{\an1}congratulatory gift
for Naruto and
Hinata's wedding.

7
00:00:25,282 --> 00:00:26,885
{\an1}Yeah! Of course!

8
00:00:26,918 --> 00:00:28,552
{\an1}<i>And? What about it? </i>

9
00:00:28,585 --> 00:00:31,388
{\an1}<i>Well, I thought we</i>
<i>could discuss what to</i>
<i>get them. </i>

10
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:32,289
<i>Sorry! </i>

11
00:00:33,423 --> 00:00:34,993
I've already got
something really
great picked out for

12
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:37,761
{\an1}them. Actually, I was
just about to go down
to the store to get it.

13
00:00:37,795 --> 00:00:39,396
{\an1}Which store? We'll
go with you!

14
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:42,766
{\an1}No, you won't! We
can't shop at the
same place. You two

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,136
can think of
something on your
own!

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:45,536
Later!

17
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:46,804
[gasping]

18
00:02:31,642 --> 00:02:33,244
{\an1}What are we gonna do
now...?

19
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,114
{\an1}Oh! Miss? I'd like
some ice cream for
dessert.

20
00:02:36,147 --> 00:02:37,447
{\an1}You, Shikamaru?

21
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:40,550
{\an1}No, nothing for me.
You sure can eat,
though, you know that?

22
00:02:40,918 --> 00:02:43,620
Your appetite
hasn't changed a bit
since you were a kid.

23
00:02:43,654 --> 00:02:46,924
{\an1}Well, I'm starting
to like chicken thigh
and grilling my beef

24
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:49,294
{\an1}super rare, so I
think that my tastes
are really beginning

25
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:50,560
{\an1}to mature.

26
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:53,530
{\an1}Sure, whatever you
say Choji. Anyway,
getting back to the

27
00:02:53,563 --> 00:02:54,765
{\an1}topic at hand...

28
00:02:54,798 --> 00:02:58,502
{\an7}Yeah, I'm thinking
maybe yuzu sorbet's
better than ice cream.

29
00:02:58,535 --> 00:03:01,605
{\an1}No! Not that! I'm
talking about Naruto
and Hinata's present!

30
00:03:01,638 --> 00:03:03,907
{\an1}Oh, yeah. Of course.
That whole thing...

31
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:05,642
{\an1}Here's your ice
cream.

32
00:03:05,676 --> 00:03:06,977
{\an1}Oh, good, it's here!

33
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,546
{\an1}From Ino's
attitude, I'm
guessing that she

34
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:11,382
{\an1}isn't gonna be
of any help to us.

35
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,451

{\an1}<i>a present in time. </i>

37
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:19,157
What do you
mean by "we"?

38
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:21,792
{\an1}I've already picked
something out.

00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:25,629
{\an1}R- Really?! What are
you getting them?!

41
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:29,599
{\an1}Since you asked, this
is what I'm thinking
of giving them.

42
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:31,568
[grunting]
Huh?

43
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:32,869
This is-!

00:03:32,903 --> 00:03:35,239
{\an1}<i>Yup, gift</i>
<i>certificates</i>
<i>for dinner!</i>

45
00:03:35,472 --> 00:03:37,874

some run-of-the-mill
place!

00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:40,477
<i>These are gift</i>

<i>to! </i>

48

{\an1}It's a special

00:03:46,783 --> 00:03:49,186

<i>talking about! And</i>

51
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,722
{\an7}<i>somehow he chose the</i>
<i>perfect gift! </i>

52
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:54,024
{\an7}<i>Having dinner in a</i>

{\an7}<i>Not a lot of gifts</i>
<i>would have as much</i>

56
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:04,134
{\an7}<i>And even if this</i>
<i>is for a special</i>
<i>occasion, he's</i>

57
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:06,670
{\an7}<i>willing to give up a</i>
<i>gift certificate to a</i>

May I have another

64
00:04:22,786 --> 00:04:25,756

wrong?

71
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:44,107
{\an1}Oh, it's nothing...
So are you planning
to go along with them?

72
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:47,711
{\an1}Are you kidding me?!
Even I know better
than a tag along with

73
00:04:47,744 --> 00:04:49,112
{\an1}newlyweds!

74
00:04:49,146 --> 00:04:52,015
{\an1}Uh, oh, yeah, right!
Of course you'd know
that!

75
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:52,182
{\an1}I was just gonna have

{\an7}<i>Choji's case... </i>

79
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:03,060
{\an7}<i>I haven't figured</i>
<i>out what to get them.</i>

80
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:04,961
{\an7}<i>And I can't waste</i>
<i>time deciding.</i>

81
00:05:04,995 --> 00:05:08,765
{\an7}<i>Something functional?</i>
<i>No, not festive</i>
<i>enough. A decorative</i>

82
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:11,568
{\an8}<i>item? No, that's</i>
<i>useless if it's not</i>
<i>their style.</i>

83
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:14,871
{\an7}<i>Flowers and food are</i>
<i>perishable, so they</i>
<i>would seem like a</i>

84
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:16,239
{\an8}<i>seasonal gift. </i>

85
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:19,076
{\an7}<i>Honestly, giving them</i>
<i>any item is risky.</i>

86
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:21,344
{\an8}<i>So that just</i>
<i>leaves cash.</i>

87
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:24,014
{\an8}<i>Actually, that's</i>
<i>not a bad idea. </i>

88
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:25,916
{\an7}<i>Then they can get</i>
<i>whatever they want.</i>

89
00:05:26,249 --> 00:05:28,018
{\an8}<i>It's way better</i>
<i>than getting</i>
<i>something they</i>

90
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:30,287
{\an8}<i>won't use or a</i>
<i>duplicate gift. </i>

91
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:34,391
{\an8}<i>Wait, what if</i>
<i>everyone else gives a</i>
<i>gift and only I give</i>

92
00:05:34,425 --> 00:05:35,358
{\an8}<i>them money... </i>

93
00:05:35,392 --> 00:05:36,927
{\an7}<i>It's not much, but</i>
<i>here ya go! </i>

94
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,963
{\an7}<i>Not good! Everyone</i>
<i>will think I was too</i>
<i>lazy to go out and</i>

95
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:42,966
{\an7}<i>buy a gift, so I just</i>
<i>handed them cash</i>
<i>without giving it a</i>

96
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:44,434
{\an8}<i>second thought! </i>

97
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,169
{\an1}You okay, Shikamaru?

98
00:05:46,203 --> 00:05:48,872
{\an1}Uh, yeah; I just felt
a chill, that's all.

99
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:51,741
{\an1}Oh, sorry. Did you
get cold from
watching me eat all

100
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:52,809
{\an1}that ice cream?

101
00:05:52,843 --> 00:05:54,579
{\an1}No, that's not it.

102
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:57,080
{\an1}I needed it. All that
barbecue got me hot!

103
00:05:57,114 --> 00:06:00,417
{\an1}<i>Plus, I'm the kind</i>
<i>of guy who could eat</i>
<i>ice cream even if</i>

{\an1}Heh, damn it, there's
nothing that could
beat your appeti--

00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:13,564
{\an1}Choji! What did you
just say?!

108
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:15,832
{\an1}Um, do you mean My
appetite beats the
cold?

109
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:17,467
{\an1}No, it was before
that!

Snow country?

111
00:06:18,835 --> 00:06:21,905
{\an1}Oh, right! I can eat
ice cream even if
I'm traveling in

112
00:06:21,938 --> 00:06:22,873
{\an1}snow country.

113
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:24,508
Heh! Travel!

00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,647
{\an1}<i>So... a honeymoon? </i>

115
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,483
Yeah. I'll give
them a honeymoon.
Thanks to you,

116
00:06:33,517 --> 00:06:35,385
I came up with
the perfect gift.

117
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:37,888
{\an1}So where are you
off to now, then?

118
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:40,524
{\an1}I have to decide on a
destination for them

119
00:06:40,558 --> 00:06:41,925
and then go and
check it out.

120
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,694
{\an1}And I'm gonna have to
get a woman's point
of view so that I can

121
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:47,164
get a sense of
whether Hinata might
like it.

122
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:49,366
{\an1}If only Ino were here
right now.

123
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:50,635
{\an1}Check it out.

124
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:51,434
Huh?!

125
00:06:55,238 --> 00:06:56,139
Uh?!

{\an1}Oh, hey, there...
It's been a while.

128
00:07:00,944 --> 00:07:02,746
Ever since that
one day, huh?

129
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:06,651
{\an1}Yeah, that's right.
So, um, what are the
two of you up to, today?

130
00:07:06,683 --> 00:07:10,655
{\an1}Oh, just stuff... We
had a little lunch.
How 'bout you?

131
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:11,922
{\an1}Uh..

132
00:07:11,955 --> 00:07:14,758
{\an7}I'm here to discuss
the Chunin Exams, and
I've been making my

133
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,726
{\an7}rounds to catch up
with a few people
here.

134
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,828
{\an1}Oh, yeah? Is that so?

135
00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:20,697
{\an1}What's the matter
with you, Choji?!

136
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,699
{\an1}I thought you mean
Ino was there.

137
00:07:22,732 --> 00:07:25,268
{\an1}You said that you
needed a woman's
point of view, but

138
00:07:25,302 --> 00:07:27,938
{\an1}that doesn't mean
that Ino has to be
the one to help out.

139
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:31,474
{\an1}But this is Temari!
She's a warrior-type
to the core. I

140
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:33,810
{\an1}can't talk to her
about some wedding
gift!

141
00:07:33,843 --> 00:07:36,379
{\an1}Seriously? You're
gonna give them a
honeymoon as a

142
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:39,115
{\an1}wedding gift? Ha!
Talk about a
ridiculous and

143
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:40,450
{\an1}pathetic idea!

144
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:43,220
{\an7}I just know that her
response would be
something like that.

145
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:46,156
{\an7}But, I mean, couldn't
you say the same
thing about Ino, too?

146
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:49,292
{\an1}Hey, just what are
you two whispering
about over there?

147
00:07:49,326 --> 00:07:51,328
{\an1}Oh, it's nothing!

148
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:53,930
I think that
Shikamaru wants to
talk to you about

149
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:54,764
something.

150
00:07:54,798 --> 00:07:56,199
T-Talk to me?

151
00:07:56,666 --> 00:08:00,403
{\an1}How about sometime...
we, uh...

152
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:02,005
{\an1}...have dinner or
something like that?

153
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:05,408
{\an1}Oh, uh so you wanna
talk? About what?

154
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:06,977

{\an1}Ah! Where would I like to

{\an1}W- What's wrong?

honeymoon, huh?

168
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:35,572

{\an7}in particular...

170
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:39,075

{\an1}Okay, I'll hear
you out.

177
00:08:57,826 --> 00:09:01,097
Oh, wow, that's
great! Well, I was
thinking that going

178
00:09:01,131 --> 00:09:03,867
somewhere like a
secluded hot springs
would be a nice and

181
00:09:08,271 --> 00:09:10,940
{\an1}No, a trip to a hot
spring sounds great!

{\an1}Really? I'm so glad
to hear that! I mean,
good food and a hot

183
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:16,880

perfect, right?

{\an7}<i>Good. At least I got</i>

choose where to go,
right?

186
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:26,890
Huh? Oh, yeah, I
guess so. Maybe I can go
check a few of them out.

early. Why not go
right now?

That's true. All
right, then-

00:13:29,264 --> 00:13:30,466
{\an1}any taste at all!

280
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,670
{\an1}Brute strength?! Are
you kidding me?! I
mean, seriously, that

281
00:13:33,703 --> 00:13:35,605
{\an1}is a completely lame
comparison!

282
00:13:35,638 --> 00:13:38,741
Excuse me... but
you're starting to
annoy all the other cust--

283
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:41,477
{\an1}You see, Ino! You're
annoying everybody,
like always!

284
00:13:41,511 --> 00:13:43,111
{\an1}What do you mean,
me?!

285
00:13:43,145 --> 00:13:45,247
[arguing]

286
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,883
This is mine!

287
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,484
{\an1}Hands off! It's mine!

288
00:13:48,518 --> 00:13:49,652
{\an1}I found it first--

289
00:13:49,686 --> 00:13:53,188
Now, now. Please
calm down! Don't pull
so hard on that,

290
00:13:53,221 --> 00:13:54,557
{\an1}or else you might-!

291
00:13:54,591 --> 00:13:55,257
[grunting]

292
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,092
{\an1}Back off and shut up!

293
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,030
[humming]

294
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:03,098
<i>You've got some</i>
<i>nerve! </i>

295
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,068
[grunting]

296
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,201
Hm!

297
00:14:06,234 --> 00:14:08,270
{\an1}Nice. Because of you,
we got kicked out of
there!

298
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:10,039
{\an1}I should be saying
that to you!

299
00:14:10,073 --> 00:14:12,475
{\an1}You don't know what
compromise means, you
have no regard for

300
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:17,145
{\an1}anyone else, and you
have no chest! All you
have is brute strength.

301
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:18,213
{\an1}Huh?!

302
00:14:18,246 --> 00:14:20,315
{\an1}My chest has nothing
to do with this!

303
00:14:20,349 --> 00:14:23,553
{\an1}The fact is, you
never win against me,
so you always bring

304
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:25,420
{\an1}up something
unrelated! You're
so immature.

305
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:29,257
I don't know the
meaning of not
winning. And besides,

306
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,426
{\an1}I win hands down in
being feminine!

307
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,097
{\an1}Being feminine?! You?
How?

308
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:37,299
Now, now, guys.
Please, just stop
fighting, okay?

309
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:40,469
{\an1}Choji! Great! Your
timing is perfect!
Which one of us do

310
00:14:40,502 --> 00:14:42,805
{\an1}you think is more
feminine, me or
Sakura?!

311
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,440
{\an1}Huh?! You can't ask
that out of the blue!

312
00:14:45,474 --> 00:14:48,310
{\an1}[chuckling] Even
Choji, your own
teammate, won't

313
00:14:48,343 --> 00:14:50,312
{\an1}pick you over
me! How sad!

314
00:14:50,345 --> 00:14:52,915
Ha! Choji's not
on your team, but
he won't even try

315
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:55,084
to flatter you.
That's what's really
sad!

316
00:14:55,118 --> 00:14:57,086
{\an1}Hey, come on, now.
Cut it out.

317
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,989
Wait, hold on a
second... If you
really want to know,

318
00:15:00,023 --> 00:15:01,924
{\an1}then why don't you
put it to a test?

319
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,291
What? A test?

320
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:05,762
For example,
personally I think
that someone who can

321
00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:08,263
cook is very
feminine. So maybe
you could see which

322
00:15:08,296 --> 00:15:09,564
{\an1}of you cooks better?

323
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,770
{\an1}Okay, let's begin
this challenge!

324
00:15:13,803 --> 00:15:16,438
{\an1}The person who makes
the tastiest food
pills will be

325
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:17,874
{\an1}declared the winner.

326
00:15:17,907 --> 00:15:20,810
{\an7}<i>You'd better watch</i>
<i>out, Sakura. I know</i>
<i>what you like and</i>

327
00:15:20,843 --> 00:15:24,047
{\an7}<i>dislike. All that I</i>
<i>have to do is cook up</i>
<i>something that'll</i>

328
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,114
{\an7}<i>make you gag.</i>

329
00:15:25,982 --> 00:15:28,216
And the judge is
gonna be Choji.

330
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,653
{\an1}Huh?! You mean you're
not gonna eat this?!

331
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:33,723
{\an1}Works for me! I may
have just eaten a
whole mountain of ice

332
00:15:33,756 --> 00:15:36,659
{\an1}cream, but I always
have room for a few
food pills!

333
00:15:36,693 --> 00:15:39,829
{\an1}Wait, just hold on...
This isn't right.
Choji's my

334
00:15:39,862 --> 00:15:42,431
{\an1}teammate. That gives
me an unfair
advantage!

335
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:46,035
{\an1}Fine by me. Anyway,
you should be okay
with having an edge...

336
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:49,005
{\an1}...unless you were
planning to poison
them to make me sick.

337
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:50,439
{\an1}But you wouldn't do
that, would you?

338
00:15:50,472 --> 00:15:53,341
{\an1}As if I would ever do
that! Come on, let's
just get this

339
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,376
thing started!

340
00:15:55,644 --> 00:15:57,546
{\an1}Now let the contest
to see who's more
feminine by making

341
00:15:57,579 --> 00:15:59,048
{\an1}food pills, begin!

342
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:00,282
Ready...?!

343
00:16:00,315 --> 00:16:01,450
Now fight!

344
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:11,060
{\an1}<i>Whoa, what is this?!</i>
<i>Instead of a mortar</i>
<i>and pestle, she's</i>

345
00:16:11,094 --> 00:16:13,763
{\an1}<i>using her fine chakra</i>
<i>control to get the</i>
<i>ingredients to the</i>

346
00:16:13,796 --> 00:16:15,697
<i>size she needs! </i>

347
00:16:15,732 --> 00:16:18,467
<i>I can't wait to</i>
<i>taste the sensation! </i>

348
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:21,971
Whoa!

349
00:16:23,072 --> 00:16:25,540
{\an1}She's searing the
ingredients with fire
power!

350
00:16:25,574 --> 00:16:28,543
{\an1}<i>Now Sakura's using</i>
<i>some legendary golden</i>
<i>honey! </i>

351
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:32,782
{\an1}<i>Ino's adding cacao</i>
<i>powder! Both seem</i>
<i>irresistible! </i>

352
00:16:35,717 --> 00:16:37,519
Th-This is--

354

{\an8}<i>It's... it's... </i>

355
00:16:48,563 --> 00:16:51,200
[yelling] Yum!

356
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,870
So delicious!

357
00:16:53,903 --> 00:16:56,973
{\an1}<i>It's rich, yet not</i>
<i>overpowering, an</i>
<i>indescribable</i>

358
00:16:57,006 --> 00:16:59,574
<i>something that</i>
<i>explodes on your</i>
<i>tongue, a delicate</i>

359
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:03,045
{\an1}<i>aroma and lingering</i>
<i>taste, a treasure</i>
<i>trove of sweetness! </i>

{\an1}<i>Choji! </i>

361
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:04,646
Hm?

362
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:05,882
{\an1}So, which one is it?

363
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:07,250
{\an1}Which tastes better?

364
00:17:07,282 --> 00:17:09,785
{\an1}Oh, I ate 'em both so
fast I couldn't tell!

00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:10,887
[groaning]

366
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,056
{\an1}But they were both
really, really good!

00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:18,727
[struggling]

368
00:17:19,061 --> 00:17:20,196

{\an1}Choji! Don't die!
Please!

374

{\an1}What is going on? Is
his life flashing
before his eyes?!

375
00:17:46,521 --> 00:17:48,958
Ino! You did use
poison, didn't you?!

376
00:17:48,991 --> 00:17:52,627
{\an1}You know I wouldn't
do that! Just who do
you think I am, anyway?

{\an1}I've made so many
great friends...

good! Choji's

{\an7}even worse!

{\an1}What are you doing?!

382
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:04,073
{\an1}I have to identify
what's inside of
these food pills

383
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:05,807
{\an1}before I can know how
to treat him.

384
00:18:05,841 --> 00:18:08,311
If there's any
poison in them, my
tongue will go numb.

385
00:18:08,343 --> 00:18:11,047
{\an1}I told you, I didn't
put poison in these!

Mm!

{\an1}How did you-?! This
is like my favorite
flavor!

{\an1}Mine too! This tastes
amazing!

{\an1}Oh man, I think I
just ate too many
sweets!

393
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:29,431
My blood sugar
probably shot
up too fast.

394
00:18:29,464 --> 00:18:30,899
But I feel
okay now!

395
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:33,401
{\an1}Is that what just
happened?! Thank
goodness.

396
00:18:33,435 --> 00:18:36,905
{\an1}Hey, Ino... Why would
you go out of your way to
make something I love?

397
00:18:36,938 --> 00:18:39,875
{\an1}To tell you the
truth, I kinda just
thought that if I

398
00:18:39,908 --> 00:18:42,410
{\an1}made you gag with
surprise, then I'd
win the contest!

399
00:18:42,444 --> 00:18:44,746
{\an1}Really?! You know
what's funny?

400
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:46,648
That was my
strategy as well!

401
00:18:46,681 --> 00:18:48,550
{\an1}Huh?! No way,
you, too?

402
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,287
{\an1}I guess, then, it's
no wonder I love how
these taste.

that we both saw right
through each other.

405
00:18:58,194 --> 00:19:00,629
{\an1}Since we know each
other so well, there's
something I

406
00:19:00,662 --> 00:19:01,897
{\an1}wanna say to you,
that okay?

407
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:02,898
{\an1}What is it?

408
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,667
Don't you think
that we'd find an
even better wedding

409
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,570
{\an1}present if we both
teamed up and looked
for one together?

{\an1}Sakura... I thought
the same thing!

{\an1}That inn seems nice.

00:19:34,596 --> 00:19:35,430
{\an1}good decision.

424
00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:38,234
{\an1}But I'm not really
mentally prepared.

425
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:41,503
{\an8}<i>What? Mentally</i>
<i>prepared? Is she</i>
<i>panicking because</i>

426
00:19:41,536 --> 00:19:43,038
{\an7}<i>this place too fancy?</i>

427
00:19:43,071 --> 00:19:45,540
{\an1}It's okay, Temari!
Let's just go inside

428
00:19:45,573 --> 00:19:46,574
and then we
can decide.

429
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:50,078
{\an7}It'll be too late
once we go in! I
could get all caught

430
00:19:50,111 --> 00:19:52,181
{\an7}up in the mood or
something like that.

431
00:19:52,214 --> 00:19:56,017
{\an7}<i>What is she talking</i>
<i>about? The mood? The</i>
<i>mood of that inn? </i>

432
00:19:56,218 --> 00:19:59,888
{\an7}<i>What does she mean by</i>
<i>getting caught up in</i>
<i>it? I don't get it!</i>

433
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:01,823
[gasping] Wait
Temari, hold on!

434
00:20:01,856 --> 00:20:03,558
You don't have a
fever, do you?

435
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,594
{\an1}All right, I've had
enough! I think I
need to go home!

436
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:08,563
{\an1}Wait, it'll be dark
soon!

437
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,367
Seriously, if
you're not feeling
well, then we really

438
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,535
{\an1}should book a room so
you can get some
rest!

439
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:14,403
[grunting]

440
00:20:14,437 --> 00:20:16,671
Please wait! I
really--

441
00:20:16,938 --> 00:20:18,707
I need you!

442
00:20:19,442 --> 00:20:21,943
{\an7}You're sure? That
I'm really the one?

443
00:20:21,977 --> 00:20:24,380
Yeah! You're the
only one!

444
00:20:24,413 --> 00:20:25,080
[gasping]

445
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:32,020
{\an1}I mean, I can't just
walk into the women's
bath to check it out.

446
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:32,554
{\an1}Huh?

447
00:20:33,822 --> 00:20:36,491
{\an1}Temari, I need you to
do this for me... Go
into the women's

448
00:20:36,524 --> 00:20:39,027
{\an1}bath and report back
with every detail!

449
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,464
That's all! It
should be easy,
right?!

450
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:45,033
{\an7}Wait a sec. What
exactly is this all
about?

451
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:48,803
{\an1}Well, what else? I
wanna give Naruto and
Hinata a honeymoon

452
00:20:48,837 --> 00:20:51,407
{\an1}for their wedding
present, and I need
to choose a good place!

453
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,908
{\an1}Oh, so that's
what's going on, huh?

454
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:56,412
{\an1}Uh, yeah... Didn't
I explain it earlier?

455
00:20:56,445 --> 00:20:59,080
{\an1}No. This is the first
I've heard of it!

456
00:20:59,114 --> 00:21:00,316
[gasping]

457

[slurping]

459
00:21:06,054 --> 00:21:08,556
{\an1}So you're back to
square one in your
search for a

460
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,758
wedding gift?

461
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,961
{\an1}Mm-hmm. But I think
it turned out for the
best in the end.

462
00:21:12,994 --> 00:21:15,096
{\an1}And? How 'bout you,
Shikamaru?

463
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,400
{\an1}Trying to explain
things is a drag.

464
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:21,202
