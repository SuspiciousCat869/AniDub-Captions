That's Lady Chiyo,

-Yes, it's Kankuro, older

examined his blood.

-Yes.

Of course not.

him right off.

able to counteract his poison.

-As a matter of fact, we've
asked for a specialist

to be sent from
the leaf village.

Perhaps it would be best

You would have us
depend on others?

53
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,957
It's because of your
dependence on this alliance

54
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,826
with a foreign land
that our own people

have become backward and lazy.

-No, we don't depend on them.

00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,166
I surely wouldn't go that far.

-Kankuro's partly to blame.

By pursuing the enemy

That old queen of slugs,
Tsunade of the leaf.

She was a thorn in my side
in the era of the Great War,

coming up with antidotes
for every kind of poison

99
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,536
I could throw at her.

100

Who knows.

101
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,572
Now that we're such
great friends with them,

102
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,741
perhaps we could
send word to her

103
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,311
to come help us
with her expertise.

104

-But Lady Tsunade is
now Hokage of the leaf.

105
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:28,982
She must look after
her own village.

106
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,951
She can't just drop everything.

107
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:34,621
Besides, even if she were to
come, what good could she do?

108
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,023
It takes three days to
travel here from the leaf.

109
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,291
-I know that.

110

I'm not a fool.

111
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,762
I wasn't seriously suggesting
we summon her here.

112

That would be the
last thing I want.

-Now let everyone gather.

142
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,288
All right.

143
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,789
Shall we begin?

144
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,274
-We'll soon be done
removing the traps

145
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,543
and debris from the road, sir.

146
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:51,744
-Good work.

147
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,346
-We've managed to
recover the remains

148
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,814
of all of our casualties.

149
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,783
But there's one concern.

150
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,017
-What's that?

151
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,887
-We haven't been able
to find Captain Yura.

152
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,188
-What?

153
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,923
-There's no doubt
to any of us that he

154
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,693
was headed for the road,
right before the incident.

155
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,563
But there's no trace of him, not
a scrap of clothing, nothing.

156
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,398
-Yes, that is strange.

157
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,267
Perhaps you just
haven't found him yet.

158
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,836
Or perhaps he managed
to survive the trap,

159
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,439
and is right now in
pursuit of the enemy.

160
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,874
I could quickly put
together a backup squad,

161
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,243
and send them out after him.

162
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:27,680
But without knowing
where he is--

163
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:30,183
SHIZUNE: Lady Tsunade,
did you call me?

-Yes.

165
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:35,255
We have to send reinforcements
to the sand village at once.

166
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,956
-Reinforcements?

167
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,859
-There's one team that must be
done with their mission by now.

168
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,061
They'll be on their way back.

169
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,030
-Oh, do you mean-- ah.

170
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:44,964
Yes, milady'.

171
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:45,765
I'll see to it.

172
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,938
-We have to be ready for
a worst case scenario.

173
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:08,321
-It will now take
three days and nights.

174
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,157
Stay aware of your
physical selves.

175
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:15,261
Zetsu, have your physical
bodies stand guard outside.

176
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,730
Use the one with
the greatest range.

177
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,198
Understood?

178
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,134
-I know.

179
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,069
Only three days?

180
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,439
Isn't it possible that it might
take longer than that, since we

181
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,342
don't have Orochimaru with us?

182
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:33,313
-All the more reason
to get started at once.

183
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:34,614
-That's true.

184
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,416
-Indeed.

185
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,817
-Sounds good to me.

186
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,819
Hm.

187
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:45,291
[chanting]

188
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,198
-Ceiling Jutsu.

189
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,632
Nine phantom dragons!

190
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,790
-Lady Tsunade, you were right.

191
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,892
They're back from their mission.

192
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:53,393
-Excellent.

193
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,998
-Uh, wait, Lady Tsunade!

194
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,935
-I've got an S-rank
mission for this squad.

195
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:03,803
-Huh?

196
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:04,771
-Really?

197
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:05,772
-Uh--

198
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:06,773
-An S-rank?

199
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:07,774
-Mission?

200
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:08,674
-You're joking.

201
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,009
You hear that?

202
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,377
We're getting an S-rank mission!

203
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,912
I don't believe it!

204
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,181
-Finally, our talents
are being recognized.

205
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,749
I knew it would happen.

206
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,184
-You can't be serious.

207
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,385
[sneezing]

208
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,487
-You feel OK,
[inaudible] Sensei?

209
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,889
-Just spent a
little too much time

210
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,391
soaking in the hot
spring, that's all.

211
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,194
-Too much time spying on
pretty girls, you mean.

212
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,596
-This is our first shot
at an S-rank mission.

213
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,998
So don't you go
blowing it for us

214
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:35,234
by getting a cold on account
of your pervy habits.

215
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,936
-What the hell's going on.

216
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:37,970
-Wrong room, milady.

217
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,539
It's over this way.

218
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,474
-Well, I should hope so.

219
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,942
-Aww.

220
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,144
-What about our S-rank mission?

221
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:46,412
-It was all a mistake.

222
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,680
Thank goodness.

223
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,453
-I'm assigning you
essentially the same mission

224
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,154
as team Kakashi.

225
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,356
Get to the sand village
as fast as possible,

226
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,325
and provide any
support necessary.

227
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,727
Is that clear?

228
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,496
-Crystal.

229
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,932
-Ready, Lady Tsunade.

230
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,067
-Leave it to us.

231
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,435
-We're on it.

232
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,503
-Good.

233
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,206
-Team Guy is always
ready for action.

234
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,808
[sneezing]

235
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:16,742
-You have a cold?

236
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,845
-No, no, just my
allergies acting up.

237
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:22,582
That's all.
[chuckling] [sniffling]

238
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:23,516
-Don't worry.

239
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,918
We'll make it to
the sand in one day.

240
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:28,788
-I think we can make it
in half a day, Sensei.

241
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,424
-It will take three days,
no matter how you slice it.

242
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,725
-Yeah.

243
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,961
What's the point of making
promises we can't keep, huh?

244
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,597
-We won't know until
we try we, will we?

245
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,299
Forward everyone, with
the speed of youth.

246
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,801
-Lead on, Sensei.

247
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,236
-It's so embarrassing.

248
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,538
-They are who they are, Tenten.

249
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,174
-They're still as
enthusiastic as ever, I see.

250
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,916
-I haven't seen Naruto
for a long time.

251
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,519
-I am curious to see
how much he has changed.

252
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,553
-Same here.

253
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,231
-We got this close
to our target.

254
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,166
And we're just sitting here.

255
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,468
I can't stand this waiting.

256
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,004
-Naruto, for the
last time, relax.

257
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,505
There's nothing we can do.

258
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,172
-I know.

259
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:20,806
But--

260
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,141
-Just be patient.

261
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,175
Would you look at Temari?

262
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,311
She's the one who's
worried the most.

263
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,547
-The cardinal rule of
traveling in the desert.

264
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,216
If you hit a sandstorm,
you stay put.

265
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:34,086
You lose all your sense of
direction in a storm like that.

266
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,689
I've heard of many people who
ended up lost in the desert,

267
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,759
and dying of thirst.

268
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:40,826
Don't worry.

269
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,495
The sandstorms we
get this time of year

270
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:46,065
usually don't last very long.

271
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,568
-Well, I just hope you're right.

272
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:53,172
-[roaring in pain]

273
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,675
-Kankuro.

274
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,176
-Quick, a sedative.

275
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:57,677
-Right.

276
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,919
-As you can see, all we're
able to do is ease his pain,

277
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,254
and try to help them rest.

278
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,756
At this stage, our
only hope is the squad

279
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,792
of leaf Shinobe, who are
due to arrive tomorrow.

280
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,764
That is, if Kankuro
can survive until then.

281
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:21,434
And if they brought an
experienced poison specialist

282
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,069
along with them.

283
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,338
-Right now, there's a
sandstorm in the desert,

284
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,607
making the route from
the leaf impassable.

285
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,308
There's no telling
how long they might

286
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,010
be delayed if it keeps up.

287
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,946
-If that happens,
then all hope is lost.

288
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,682
-That we've sunk
to this, I never

289
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,785
thought I'd see the day when
we'd have to depend on the leaf

290
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,120
to help us.

291
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,789
-You must be weary, my sister.

292
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:44,557
Come.

293
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,992
We'll find a seat outside.

294
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:50,196
You haven't had a wink
of sleep since yesterday.

295
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:54,600
LADY CHIYO: Relying on
the leaf, it's pathetic.

296
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:55,001
Mm.

297
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,672
-Hey, sis?

298
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,379
[sigh] Asleep.

299
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,590
-If they left once they
got word and moved quickly,

300
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,225
they could be here any minute.

301
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,259
-Don't count on it.

302
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,727
Even one of our own
people would have

303
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,563
had a hard time
with that sandstorm.

304
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,432
-[gasp] Look, over there.

305
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,841
-We've been expecting you.

306
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,543
-Lady Temari, you
were with them?

307
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,744
-Please, this way.

308
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,351
-What?

309
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,186
You say they've got
Kankuro as well?

310
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,154
-Yes.

311
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,288
When the enemy
took Lord Kazekage,

312
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,224
Kankuro went after
them by himself.

313
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:53,592
He was poisoned.

314
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:56,095
And we haven't been able to
find anything to counteract it.

315
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,765
He won't last much longer.

316
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,567
-Damn it.

317
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,569
-Don't give up yet, Temari.

318
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,538
Let me take a look at him.

319
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,444
TEMARI: Kankuro!

320
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,412
-Kankuro!

321
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:14,914
-(THINKING) Him!

322
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,349
The white fang of the leaf.

323
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,881
Damn you!

324
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:22,788
-Huh?

325
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:26,992
-Get ready to defend
yourself or die!

326
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:32,865

00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,987
FEMALE SPEAKER: Emergency
medical situation, 2400 hours.

328
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:03,589
We're coming to you
live from the sand

329
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,925
medical facility, where a
patient in critical condition

330
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,960
has just been
wheeled into the ER.

331
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,429
The patient, a 17-year-old
in serious condition,

332
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:11,964
appears to be a
victim of poisoning.

333
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,767
The doctor in charge is a
young female, very young,

334
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,801
perhaps too young.

335
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,403
But she seems to be
successfully drawing

336
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,505
the poison from his
body and-- [gasp] oh no.

337
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,073
[beep]

338
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:24,143
Despite a heroic effort, the
procedure was not a success.

339
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:24,910
KANKURO: Damn it.

340
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,045
You can't kill me off yet.

341
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,781
NARUTO: Next time, the
medical ninja's student.

342
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:32,184

343
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,628
SAKURA: Notable people
of the leaf village.

344
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,097
In this part of the show,
we ask a famous person

345
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,900
from the village to share
their experiences with us.

346
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:50,035
Our guest today
is the only female

347
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:56,275
among the legendary Sani, the
Fifth Hokage, Lady Tsunade.

348
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,878
Even while defending the village
with your unsurpassed strength

349
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:00,913
and medical Ninjutsu,
you still remain

350
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:02,481
the loveliest [inaudible] ever.

351
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:03,849
How do you do it, milady?

352
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,985
Do you have any beauty
tips for our viewers?

353
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:08,220
LADY TSUNADE: Rule number
one, get plenty of sleep.

354
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:09,521
Oh, I see.

355
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,324
Then, drink plenty of
sake, but only the best.

356
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:14,126
Good sake is great for the skin.

357
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,361
SAKURA: Ah.

358
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,528
LADY TSUNADE: Then, of
course, you should always--

359
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:17,897
NARUTO: Stop right here, Sakura.

360
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,765
What do you care
about her beauty tips?

361
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,867
I mean, she still
looks like an old lady.

362
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:22,601
LADY TSUNADE: What?

363
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:23,802
NARUTO: Come on.

364
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:25,738
What do you want with a
big curvy body like hers?

365
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,172
It just slows you down.

366
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:30,109
What's wrong with the nice,
skinny, bony body you've got?

367
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,544
-The skinny, bony
body I've got, huh?

368
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,380
-Old lady, am I?

369
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,581
NARUTO: Uh.

370
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,149
-Goodbye.
