{\an1}I thought Guy Sensei wanted to

Energy Bomb, was it?

{\an1}And what's the blue
aura you're emitting?

17
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,641
{\an1}Hirudora's a taijutsu;
it isn't a ninjutsu
that uses chakra.

18

<i>it spreads quickly outward.</i>

{\an1}And this aura that's
surrounding me isn't chakra.

{\an7}<i>Itachi. It's just</i>

00:15:21,845 --> 00:15:23,981
<i>[Kisame]</i>
<i>I'll be teaming up with</i>
<i>you starting today.</i>

172
00:15:25,082 --> 00:15:30,891
{\an4}I'm Kisame Hoshigaki,
formerly of the Hidden Mist,
one of the Seven Ninja
Swordsman.

173
00:15:31,558 --> 00:15:33,760
So pleased to make
your acquaintance.

174
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:39,835
{\an1}And you are Itachi Uchiha,
formerly of the Hidden Leaf.

175
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:45,876
{\an5}I've heard the rumors.
that you slaughtered
all of your fellow
Uchiha clansmen.

176
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:52,250
{\an1}<i>I think that we're</i>
<i>alike, you and I.</i>

177
00:15:53,518 --> 00:15:57,023
{\an1}<i>That's the reason I</i>
<i>wanted to be teamed with</i>
<i>you in the Akatsuki.</i>

178
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:03,130
{\an1}It's really indescribable,
isn't it?

179
00:16:03,398 --> 00:16:07,937
{\an1}Killing your comrades is
quite a sensation, wouldn't
you say so, Itachi?

180
00:16:10,707 --> 00:16:12,074
You talk a lot.

181
00:16:13,376 --> 00:16:17,148
{\an1}You don't understand me.
You don't even
understand yourself.

182
00:16:20,352 --> 00:16:23,656
{\an1}You're just a thug who got lost
in the mist and ended up here.

183
00:16:24,324 --> 00:16:28,329
{\an1}You can't even control where
you're going. Am I wrong?

184
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,504
Do you want to know
something interesting?

185
00:16:36,772 --> 00:16:42,881
{\an4}Most sharks are ovoviviparous,
which means that the eggs
hatch inside the female's body
before the young are born.

186
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:46,552
{\an1}However, with some kinds
of sharks, the number of
eggs that hatch

187
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:50,122
{\an1}will differ from the number
of young that emerge out of
their mother's belly.

188
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:52,526
{\an1}<i>Do you know why that is?</i>

189
00:17:00,904 --> 00:17:02,839
{\an1}Because of cannibalism.

190
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:08,445
{\an4}Right from the moment
they hatch, they start
eating each other inside
their mother's uterus.

191
00:17:10,214 --> 00:17:13,853
The fratricidal
warfare begins as
soon as they're born.

192
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,559
{\an1}To each shark, all the others
are just food to be eaten.

193
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:25,668
{\an1}Starting today, you are
an Akatsuki member and my
companion. So be wary.

194
00:17:26,602 --> 00:17:27,871
Of me.

195
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,011
{\an1}Same goes for you.

196
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:36,447
He he he he he.

197
00:17:37,816 --> 00:17:41,754
Well, let's be
friends and have
some fun, all right?

198
00:17:41,955 --> 00:17:45,859
And hope that we will
not end up as each
other's final opponents.

199
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:51,132
{\an1}No one who dares to raise
their hand against a comrade
ever dies a decent death.

200
00:17:52,702 --> 00:17:53,769
{\an1}Remember that.

201
00:17:53,803 --> 00:17:55,404
[chuckle]
Hm hm hm hm hm!

202
00:17:55,438 --> 00:17:57,874
Well, that means our
fates are sealed.

203
00:17:57,908 --> 00:18:00,845
Seems you and
I are depraved
and worthless.

204
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:02,080
Not true.

205
00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:05,517
{\an1}We are both human, not fish.

206
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:13,894
{\an4}No matter who you are, you
do not truly know what kind
of man you've become until
you reach the very end.

207
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:19,068
{\an1}<i>[Itachi]</i>
<i>One realizes one's true nature</i>
<i>at the moment of death.</i>

208
00:18:20,302 --> 00:18:22,338
{\an1}<i>Don't you think that's</i>
<i>what death is about?</i>

209
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:23,774
{\an8}<i>[Kisame]</i>
<i>Itachi...</i>

210

<i>kind of person you truly were?</i>

211
00:18:32,051 --> 00:18:39,093
{\an7}<i>Well, Itachi, It seems</i>

He actually fed himself...
to his own sharks.

214
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:10,900
He was weakened
pretty badly.

215
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:15,304
{\an1}I guess he figured that
he wouldn't be able to
escape from us.

216
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,345
An Akatsuki member
strong enough to be
paired with Itachi.

217
00:19:22,114 --> 00:19:24,650
He was long feared as
the scourge of the Mist.

218
00:19:24,983 --> 00:19:27,487
{\an1}I never imagined he
would go out this way.

219
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:30,991
Is he dead?
I mean, really?

220
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:33,494
[sad growling]

221
00:19:34,495 --> 00:19:37,232
Well, this fella sure
seems downhearted.

222
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,437
{\an1}It looks like it's for real.
He's actually departed.

223
00:19:42,873 --> 00:19:43,774
But, still.

224
00:19:44,942 --> 00:19:48,079
He died instead of
giving up intel on
his comrades.

225
00:19:49,614 --> 00:19:53,954
{\an1}Even in the Akatsuki, there
remain some who put their
comrades ahead of themselves.

226
00:20:01,362 --> 00:20:02,631
An admirable foe.

227
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:06,002
A shinobi's life
is measured by the
manner of his death.

228
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:11,509
{\an1}Kisame Hoshigaki!

229
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:14,345
{\an1}I will remember you
the rest of my life.

But he recorded
information about
us on that scroll,

232
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:28,463
and was planning
on smuggling it
out of here.

233
00:20:28,496 --> 00:20:31,500
{\an1}If that's the case,
we should confirm the
contents of that scroll.
