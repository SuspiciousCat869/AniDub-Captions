1
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:12,137
(Ashura)
My chakra's reacting
very strongly.

2
00:00:17,243 --> 00:00:19,145
<i>(Kanna)</i>
<i>What is that?</i>

3
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:22,650
{\an1}It's the same thing that was
growing on all of those sick
people.

4
00:00:22,683 --> 00:00:27,521
{\an1}I see!  The Divine Tree's sap
has seeped into the soil.

5
00:00:27,555 --> 00:00:33,695
{\an4}The sap acts like a fertilizer,
making this area a lush oasis in
the middle of such a barren
region.

6
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:38,133
{\an1}The power of the Divine Tree is
what's making the land fertile?

7
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,401
Yeah...

8
00:00:39,434 --> 00:00:42,639
{\an1}So, then that means the Divine
Tree's getting its power back?!

9
00:00:42,672 --> 00:00:45,975
{\an1}No,  or at least it hasn't
completely revived yet...

10
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:49,312
{\an1}But... in time it
probably will...

11
00:00:49,345 --> 00:00:53,317
{\an1}The real problem is...

12
00:00:53,517 --> 00:00:54,885
{\an1}Is what?

13
00:00:54,918 --> 00:00:58,089
{\an1}The villagers are becoming
contaminated.

14
00:00:58,123 --> 00:01:00,091
{\an1}Contaminated?!

15
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:04,161
{\an1}Yeah. The people and animals eat
the produce that was grown on
this land...

16
00:01:04,195 --> 00:01:06,999
{\an1}...which has accumulated
the sap of the Divine Tree.

17
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:11,771
{\an1}<i>Wait... does that mean, if you</i>
<i>eat the food here, you're gonna</i>
<i>get sick?!</i>

18
00:01:11,804 --> 00:01:13,639
<i>(Asura)</i>
<i>Probably.</i>

19
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:16,143
{\an1}<i>Blargh! But... I ate</i>
<i>so much yesterday!</i>

20
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:18,145
It'll be okay.

21
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:21,313
{\an1}With my jutsu I can take
care of a small amount...

22
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:25,619
{\an1}But if you've eaten
it for many years.

23
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:30,792
{\an1}Hey, wait... since the Village
Elder ordered this place to be
kept under watch...

24
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:34,028
{\an1}...does that mean he
knows everything about
what's been going on here?

25
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:36,264
{\an1}So it would seem...

00:03:26,385 --> 00:03:28,021
That's right.

38
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:33,426
{\an1}Tell me, traveler, why is it
that you insist on digging for
our village's secrets?

39
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,230
Forgive me. I
was sent here.

40
00:03:36,263 --> 00:03:38,999
I was told to come by
the Village of Ninshu.

41
00:03:39,365 --> 00:03:44,738
{\an1}Ninshu? What destroyed the
land twenty years ago?

42
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:46,975
{\an1}You are a pupil
of that discipline?

43
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:48,610
Yes.

44
00:03:48,643 --> 00:03:53,149
{\an1}That tree is a remnant of the
specter that almost destroyed
our entire world.

45
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:55,383
{\an1}That's why it's so powerful.

46
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:58,821
{\an1}<i>I've been ordered to do</i>
<i>something about it.</i>

47
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,162
{\an1}<i>Lord Elder, to be blunt,</i>
<i>that tree is a narcotic.</i>

48
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:09,166
{\an1}<i>The power of the Divine Tree</i>
<i>is indeed making this land</i>
<i>fruitful...</i>

49
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,237
{\an1}<i>But... it's also making</i>
<i>the villagers ill.</i>

50
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,341
{\an1}<i>...At this rate...</i>

51
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:20,111
{\an1}Yes, Traveler, I am
already aware of it.

52
00:04:20,144 --> 00:04:23,983
{\an1}But I cannot authorize
that tree's destruction.

53
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:25,450
Why is that?

54
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:30,756
{\an1}Several decades ago... that tree
began to grow dramatically...

55
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:35,494
{\an1}<i>Prior to that, this land</i>
<i>was arid and barren.</i>

56
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:39,199
{\an1}<i>We had terrible droughts</i>
<i>nearly every year.</i>

57
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:43,237
{\an1}<i>I've lost count of how</i>
<i>many starved to death.</i>

58
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:46,774
{\an1}Why don't you just
try digging a well?

59
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:48,409
{\an1}It was futile.

60
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:49,744
Futile?

61
00:04:49,777 --> 00:04:52,047
{\an1}<i>We tried that ages ago.</i>

62
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,886
{\an1}<i>One could dig for years, only to</i>
<i>hit the solid bedrock that runs</i>
<i>beneath this entire land.</i>

63
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:04,227
{\an1}<i>If we cut down that tree now,</i>
<i>what will happen to us?</i>

64
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:09,333
{\an1}<i>I cannot tell the villagers that</i>
<i>we'll return to those days of</i>
<i>hunger and suffering.</i>

65
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:15,306
{\an1}Besides, even if I told
them the truth, the villagers
wouldn't believe me.

66
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:20,744
{\an1}Traveler, please... don't get
involved any further...

67
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:25,417
{\an1}It would be best if you
were to leave soon.

68
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:30,289
{\an1}Kanna, what do you think?

69
00:05:30,323 --> 00:05:32,091
{\an1}Think about what?

70
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:35,995
{\an1}In time, you'll become infected
by the Divine Tree, as well.

71
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:38,998
{\an1}I know. And?! We have
no other choice!

72
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:42,035
{\an1}Even if we wanted to
leave, there's nowhere
else for us to go!

73
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:45,238
{\an1}We just have to endure
and live with it!

74
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:50,010
{\an1}All of you! Please,
listen to me!

75
00:05:50,043 --> 00:05:53,414
{\an1}Do you know the truth
behind the Divine Tree?

76
00:05:53,448 --> 00:05:55,616
{\an1}[gasp]
Hey, Ashura...!

77
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,486
<i>(Ashura)</i>
<i>The Divine Tree is the</i>
<i>ruins of a specter.</i>

78
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:02,724
{\an1}It's the cause of the illness
afflicting those at the clinic.

79
00:06:02,757 --> 00:06:07,896
{\an1}And if you keep relying on its
power you'll all fall victim to
the same thing!

80
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,734
{\an1}Ask yourself: are you
okay with that?

81
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:14,671
Everyone! You don't have
to listen to this guy!

82
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:18,174
{\an1}The two of them came here
from the Village of Ninshu!

83
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:22,113
{\an1}Yeah!  They ravaged the world,
and now they want to try to take
the Divine Tree away from us!

84
00:06:22,146 --> 00:06:24,514
{\an1}We can't let them do that!

85
00:06:24,547 --> 00:06:26,917
{\an1}Just leave!  Get outta here!

86
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:30,588
{\an1}What do you think would happen
to us if the Divine Tree was
gone, huh?!

87
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:32,290
{\an1}Ashura, let's go!

88

93
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:51,711
{\an1}Brother, to what kind of places
did you send those two?

94
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:56,050
{\an1}Simply put, two villages that
were burdened with the same
problem.

95
00:06:56,083 --> 00:07:00,721
{\an1}I want to see what choices they
make, and how they resolve the
problems.

96
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,391
{\an1}Ah, yes, I understand.

97
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:07,095
{\an1}But be honest, have you already
decided which one'll succeed
you?

98
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:09,432
No, I haven't.

99
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:12,634
{\an1}<i>Indra's abilities are</i>
<i>extraordinary...</i>

100
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:16,138
{\an1}<i>...but he's too quick to try to</i>
<i>resolve everything by himself.</i>

101
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:19,008
{\an1}<i>Ashura is truly kind</i>
<i>to others</i> ...

102
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:21,745
{\an1}... <i>but hesitates to</i>
<i>take the lead.</i>

103
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:26,883
{\an4}If this journey that they've
been sent on helps to them
mature and learn to support each
other

104
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:29,554
{\an1}then I would have no complaints.

105
00:07:29,586 --> 00:07:32,957
{\an1}<i>Gamamaru, have you</i>
<i>had any new dreams?</i>

107
00:07:36,027 --> 00:07:37,995
{\an1}If I did, would you
want me to tell you?

108
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:42,000
{\an1}That'd be cheating.  You must
name your successor by yourself.

ever be able to reach a
decision.

117
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:34,091
Come on, Ashura.
Let's go, already!

118
00:08:34,124 --> 00:08:37,928
{\an1}Let's just head out and have
a carefree journey, okay?

119
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:44,436
{\an1}[groan] If you're really that
concerned, just sneak over
there and destroy the tree!

120
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,473
I mean, you do have the
power to do that, don't you?

121
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:50,576
{\an1}But if I do that, then all of
the villagers will...

{\an1}They'll suffer, sure!  But
everyone dies eventually!

123
00:08:54,113 --> 00:09:00,420
{\an1}You know...  now that I think of
it...  Father didn't tell me to
destroy the Divine Tree.

124
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:02,322
{\an3}Huh?

125
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:07,995
{\an4}Indra, Ashura. You are to go to
those lands and fix whatever
problems may have occurred
there.

126
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:12,568
{\an1}Wait, that's right!  Father said
to resolve the problem...!

127
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:17,206
{\an1}Hey, hold on, now. I hope that
you're not getting any crazy
ideas.

128
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:22,545
{\an1}To solve the problem,  there's
no other way but to dig a well.

129

{\an1}What?! You heard that village
elder! There's bedrock under
here!

130
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:27,951
It'd take years!

131
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:33,424
{\an1}Yes. But a little while
back, Father told me.

132
00:09:33,457 --> 00:09:38,462
{\an1}The power of Ninshu that you
have inherited. I'm afraid
there's no handbook for its use.

the right way to employ it.
