1
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,158
{\an1}It was like a dream...
Uchiha and Senju

2
00:00:18,191 --> 00:00:19,993
{\an1}had joined forces.

3
00:00:20,026 --> 00:00:22,762
{\an1}There would no longer
be mass casualties,

4
00:00:22,796 --> 00:00:25,832
{\an1}nor would any more
children have to die.

5
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:32,806
{\an1}And so at last we
began building our village.

6
00:00:34,874 --> 00:00:38,079
{\an1}Later, we would ally with
the Land of Fire, and so

7
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:41,581
{\an1}began the creation of a
peaceful state unit. Where

8
00:00:41,614 --> 00:00:44,952
{\an1}nation and village
stood on equal footing.

9
00:00:45,886 --> 00:00:49,123
In any case, it
was dreamlike...

10
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:17,439
{\an1}Do you remember how
we used to talk here

11
00:04:17,472 --> 00:04:18,674
{\an1}when we were brats?

12
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:20,908
Yeah...

13
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,978
Let's build our
settlement right here!

14
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:25,046
Huh?!

15
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:27,882
{\an1}And there we'll make it
so kids won't have to kill

16
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:29,051
{\an1}each other, and...

17
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:31,687
{\an1}We'll create this awesome
school where kids can train

18
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,822
and grow up to
become stronger!

19
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:36,325
{\an1}Assign missions that
fit people's abilities

20
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:38,060
and their
strengths, too!

21
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:40,797
{\an1}Have superiors who
are able to properly

22
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:42,864
assign ranks
to commissions!

23
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:45,233
{\an1}A place where kids
don't have to be sent

24
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:46,769
{\an1}into harsh battlefronts.

25
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:49,706
{\an1}[chuckling] You do
realize it's only you

26
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:51,374
{\an1}spouting such nonsense.

27
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:54,344
{\an1}Yeah? What about you?!

28
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,844
{\an1}It sounds pretty good!

29
00:04:55,877 --> 00:04:57,480
{\an1}Well, then it's decided!

30
00:04:57,513 --> 00:04:58,581
All right!

31
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:02,185
{\an1}If that settlement is built,
then that would mean...

32
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,654
{\an1}I could protect my
brother here, from this

33
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:06,222
{\an1}boundless vantage point!

34
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:08,726
[chuckle]

35
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:21,772
{\an1}To be honest, I thought
we were only dreaming.

36
00:05:21,805 --> 00:05:24,708
{\an1}It's often been said that
wherever there's a will,

37
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:26,410
{\an1}there's a way, and yet, I.

38
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:29,279
That dream's now
becoming reality.

39
00:05:29,313 --> 00:05:32,082
{\an1}The leader who, from the
shadows, protects the Land

40
00:05:32,116 --> 00:05:35,085
{\an1}of Fire is the Hokage. Well?

41
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,220
{\an1}What do you mean?

42
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,989
{\an1}The Land of Fire's asked
that we pick someone to

43
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:40,859
{\an1}represent the Village.

44
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:43,628
{\an1}I'm considering naming
you to be our leader...

45
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:44,995
The Hokage.

46
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,031
{\an1}You've no blood siblings...

47
00:05:48,065 --> 00:05:51,135
{\an1}But I want you to
think of all the village

48
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:52,670
{\an1}shinobi as siblings.

49
00:05:52,704 --> 00:05:55,973
{\an1}I want you to protect
them with all your might.

50
00:05:59,344 --> 00:06:01,980
Me, who couldn't
protect my own brethren?

51
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:10,922
Kawarama...

52
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:13,024
[crying]

53
00:06:13,057 --> 00:06:15,193
Itama!

54
00:06:15,226 --> 00:06:17,996
Itama!

55
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,312
{\an1}What's the matter?

56
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:38,685
{\an1}My little brother died...

57
00:06:42,354 --> 00:06:43,989
{\an1}I come to the river...

58
00:06:45,392 --> 00:06:47,594
{\an1}...because I feel like all
the haziness in my heart

59
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:49,796
{\an1}gets washed away as
I stare at the water.

60
00:06:51,798 --> 00:06:53,433
{\an1}So that's what happened...

61
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:56,803
{\an1}Your name's Madara, right?

62
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,639
Could it be that
way for you, too?

63
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,077
{\an1}Do you have siblings?

64
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:07,113
{\an1}I'm one of five.

65
00:07:07,147 --> 00:07:09,516
Well, there used
to be five of us.

66
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:23,498
{\an1}So... do you have
any siblings left?

67
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:26,834
{\an1}I do. I still have
one younger brother

68
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:29,237
{\an1}who's still alive.

69
00:07:29,872 --> 00:07:32,540
And I'm going to
protect him, no matter

70
00:07:32,573 --> 00:07:34,242
{\an1}what happens, I swear!

71
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:37,646
{\an1}So, what about you?

72
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:41,382
{\an1}I have one brother left,
too. And I also intend to

73
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:43,284
protect him, no
matter what.

74
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,291
{\an1}Flying Raijin Slice!

75
00:07:52,026 --> 00:07:53,595
[wet cough]

76
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:55,931
Izuna!

77
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,611
{\an1}There's no time to
get weak-kneed now!

78
00:08:08,645 --> 00:08:11,548
{\an1}In addition to the Uchiha
and Senju, it seems the

79
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:15,150
{\an1}Sarutobi and Shimura
Clans want to join us, too!

80
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:19,856
{\an1}You're kidding! A-
are you serious?!

81
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:22,792
{\an1}And others as well!
This village is going

82
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:24,494
{\an1}to keep expanding!

83
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:27,497
{\an1}We're going to need to
find a name for it...

84
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,732
You have any
thoughts on that?

85
00:08:39,877 --> 00:08:44,147
{\an1}How about... the Village
Hidden in the Leaves?

86
00:08:45,382 --> 00:08:49,085
{\an1}So simplistic. No
ingenuity. You called it

87
00:08:49,118 --> 00:08:50,154
{\an1}exactly as you saw it.

88
00:08:50,187 --> 00:08:53,157
{\an1}How's that different
from "Hokage?!" [sigh]

89
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,961
{\an1}And I see you're still
getting depressed easily!

90
00:08:57,227 --> 00:09:00,264
{\an1}It had taken a long time,
but it felt like we were

91
00:09:00,297 --> 00:09:02,366
{\an1}back to being the
friends we once were.

92
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,371
{\an1}You're saying that the
Hokage would stay in the

93
00:09:07,404 --> 00:09:10,508
{\an1}village and make sure
that everyone's protected?

94
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:12,744
{\an1}Yes, there's that.
But that's just a

95
00:09:12,777 --> 00:09:13,979
{\an1}small part of it.

96
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,248
{\an1}As all our village-building
picks up speed, the Hokage

97
00:09:17,282 --> 00:09:19,951
{\an1}is going to become
busier as well.

98
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:22,687
{\an1}That's the reason why I
want to have your likeness

99
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:25,223
carved into this
cliff face at our feet.

100
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,593
{\an1}As a symbol of our
village's protector!

101
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:32,197
{\an1}Now you're kidding...

102
00:09:32,765 --> 00:09:35,467
{\an1}But your face is a bit
too stern, so it will

103
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,636
{\an1}have to be softened up!

104
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:41,040
{\an1}Maybe so, but it still beats
that sad look of yours!

105
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:43,643
I didn't know it
was really that sad?

106
00:09:43,676 --> 00:09:48,147
{\an1}[chuckling] Oh, yeah! To be
honest, it's beyond sad!

107
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,250
Is that so?

108
00:09:52,052 --> 00:09:56,355
{\an1}Ah! There you are! What
are you dawdling here for?!

109
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:58,792
{\an1}The Feudal Lords from the
Land of Fire will be here

110
00:09:58,825 --> 00:10:00,326
{\an1}soon for the conference!

111
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:01,828
Tobirama?

112
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:14,206
For Hokage?!

113
00:10:14,908 --> 00:10:18,045
{\an1}That's not your choice!
To propose Madara as a

114
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:20,013
candidate for
leader is fine...

115
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:22,582
{\an1}But the decision should
come from the village's

116
00:10:22,616 --> 00:10:25,119
{\an1}popular opinion and
discourse with the Land

117
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:26,286
{\an1}of Fire's top officials!

118
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:28,990
{\an1}Things are different
from Father's era!

119
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:29,991
Yes, but...

120
00:10:30,024 --> 00:10:32,760
{\an1}And Besides... Selecting
Madara to be the leader

121
00:10:32,794 --> 00:10:34,394
{\an1}isn't a good idea.

122
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:37,899
{\an1}Everyone knows that you
are the driving force behind

123
00:10:37,932 --> 00:10:39,534
this village.

124
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:42,970
{\an1}It's true! Even the
Uchiha will admit that.

125
00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:46,607
{\an1}Plus, haven't you heard the
rumors about the Uchiha?

126
00:10:48,242 --> 00:10:50,945
{\an1}The stronger their
hate, the stronger

127
00:10:50,978 --> 00:10:52,647
{\an1}their Visual Prowess.

128
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:55,184
That's the
Sharingan's power.

129
00:10:55,216 --> 00:10:57,953
Simply put,
they're unpredictable.

130
00:10:58,386 --> 00:10:59,554
For the future
of the village-

131
00:10:59,587 --> 00:11:02,256
Stop saying such
things, Tobirama!

132
00:11:17,606 --> 00:11:20,709
{\an1}I could've sworn I felt
someone's presence...

133
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:22,644
{\an1}You'd know better
than I would.

134
00:11:22,678 --> 00:11:23,645
{\an1}Did you sense anything?

135
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,648
{\an1}No... I'm not infusing
chakra right now.

136
00:11:26,682 --> 00:11:29,085
Don't change the
subject, elder brother!

137
00:11:37,894 --> 00:11:40,930
{\an1}From now on, we will run
things democratically.

138
00:11:40,964 --> 00:11:42,699
Any objections?

139
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:45,368
{\an1}No... That's fine.

140
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:52,408
And so I became
the First Hokage.

141
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:23,208
{\an1}I became the First Hokage.

142
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,053
{\an1}Out of the Era of Warring
States, where shinobi clans

143
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:37,122
fought and
killed each other.

144
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:40,759
{\an1}The Uchiha and Senju
joined to create the ideal

145
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:46,064
{\an1}shinobi village, a place
born from the hope for peace.

146
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:49,001
{\an1}That is the Village
Hidden in the Leaves.

147
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:53,172
And I was chosen
to lead it...

148
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,880
{\an1}This stone tablet has
been passed down within the

149
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:04,349
{\an1}Uchiha for generations. It
has never been shown to an

150
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:05,518
{\an1}outsider before.

151
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:09,589
{\an1}Its special text requires
Visual Prowess to decipher.

152
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,660
{\an1}As far as I am able to
decode so far, it says...

153
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:19,832
{\an1}"One god, seeking stability,
split into light and shadow."

154
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,002
{\an1}"It is these opposites
operating together that give

155
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,338
{\an1}rise to all things."

156
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,208
{\an1}It is a universal truth
that applies to everything.

157
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:31,879
{\an1}In short, it states that
true happiness can be found

158
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,948
{\an1}when two contrary
powers cooperate together.

159
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:38,819
{\an1}However, it could be
interpreted differently.

160
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:46,526
{\an1}Hashirama, do you really
believe that I know nothing?

161
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,063
{\an1}Please, just leave
Tobirama to me.

162
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:51,531
I can't do
this without you.

163
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:54,903
{\an1}Be the Hokage's right hand.
And keep working with me

164
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:56,570
as a brother!

165
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:59,539
{\an1}The people will eventually
recognize your merits.

166
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:01,609
{\an1}I'll name you Second Hokage.

167
00:14:01,643 --> 00:14:03,378
I suspect...

168
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,714
Tobirama will be
the Second Hokage.

169
00:14:06,748 --> 00:14:09,884
{\an1}If so, the Uchiha will
slowly be expunged.

170
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:13,054
{\an1}Thus, I've spoken to the
Uchiha, reaching out to the

171
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:15,124
{\an1}others about leaving
the village, too.

172
00:14:15,157 --> 00:14:18,593
{\an1}But it seems no one is
willing to come with me.

173
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:19,861
Madara...

174
00:14:20,828 --> 00:14:23,665
I could not
protect my brothers...

175
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:26,368
{\an1}And it seems I won't
be able to keep my

176
00:14:26,402 --> 00:14:29,038
{\an1}oath to protect my Clan.

177
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:32,708
{\an1}I'm not even trusted by the
brethren I want to protect.

178
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:34,877
No, that's not
true! Everyone will-

179
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,746
{\an1}Perhaps I should've only
given you the option of

180
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,682
killing your
brother that day...

181
00:14:41,251 --> 00:14:44,453
{\an1}You call me your brother,
but which of us would you

182
00:14:44,486 --> 00:14:46,855
{\an1}sacrifice for the
sake of the village?

183
00:14:51,394 --> 00:14:54,864
{\an1}I'd like to think that I
know you pretty well.

184
00:14:54,898 --> 00:14:56,199
I've had enough.

185
00:14:57,566 --> 00:15:00,370
{\an1}I'm leaving the village.

186
00:15:00,403 --> 00:15:03,206
{\an1}I've found a different
path, a different way.

187
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:06,509
{\an1}I can see it only because
we have bared our insides to

188
00:15:06,543 --> 00:15:08,812
each other.
Cooperation is merely a

189
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:10,847
{\an1}quieter form of conflict.

190
00:15:11,147 --> 00:15:14,617
{\an1}That's not true! I
won't let it be!

191
00:15:14,651 --> 00:15:17,620
{\an1}It's what you make of
reality, Hashirama.

192
00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:20,157
Let's not argue
trivialities.

193
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:23,493
{\an1}It's much sounder just
to see this world as

194
00:15:23,526 --> 00:15:24,561
entertainment.

195
00:15:24,594 --> 00:15:28,199
{\an1}Have you been listening
to me at all?! Madara?!

196
00:15:28,232 --> 00:15:32,870
{\an1}You are the only one
who's a match for me.

197
00:15:32,903 --> 00:15:36,874
{\an1}I look forward to the
battles we shall fight...

198
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:39,877
...until I
achieve my true dream.

199
00:15:47,752 --> 00:15:50,222
And what is
your true dream?!

200
00:15:50,255 --> 00:15:52,991
{\an1}I thought everything we've
aimed for is right here in

201
00:15:53,025 --> 00:15:54,259
this village!

202
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:56,695
{\an1}You simply can't see it.

203
00:15:56,728 --> 00:15:58,562
{\an1}What's even further ahead.

204
00:15:58,897 --> 00:16:01,700
{\an1}Dreams of the far future.

205
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,441
{\an1}Then tell me about
them, Madara please!

206
00:16:09,841 --> 00:16:12,811
{\an1}If they're linked to the
village's dreams, then I'll

207
00:16:12,844 --> 00:16:14,980
{\an1}need to have your
strength as a leader,

208
00:16:15,014 --> 00:16:16,581
a senior member.

209
00:16:16,615 --> 00:16:19,852
{\an1}Also as a friend, too.

210
00:16:20,786 --> 00:16:22,721
[chuckle]

211
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:28,027
{\an1}There is no link. And
you shall never reach it.

212
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:30,596
It is useless to
chase after me.

213
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,867
{\an1}You of all people should
know. That no one's capable

214
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:36,669
{\an1}of catching me from behind.

215
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:43,910
{\an1}Upon saying that,
Madara left the village.

216
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:02,162
We had come this
far together...

217
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,899
{\an1}And now, Madara was
gone from the village

218
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:07,469
{\an1}we had both created.

219
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:12,906
{\an1}But in the world at large,
everyone respected and

220
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,709
{\an1}started replicating our
village system of Allied

221
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:16,844
Ninja Clans.

222
00:17:16,877 --> 00:17:20,348
{\an1}Which had been created by
the former warring rivals,

223
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:23,617
{\an1}Uchiha and Senju,
joining forces.

224
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,621
{\an1}Villages like the Hidden
Leaf, which began in the

225
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:29,525
{\an1}Land of Fire with its
one-leader system, spread

226
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:32,694
{\an1}like wildfire across
the Great Nations.

227
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:34,996
{\an1}In the Land of Lightning,
the Hidden Cloud Village was

228
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:38,800
{\an1}formed, and they named
their leader the Raikage.

229
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,537
{\an1}In the Land of Earth, they
founded the Hidden Stone

230
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,872
Village with its
leader, the Tsuchikage.

231
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:47,742
{\an1}In the Land of Water, the
Hidden Mist Village was

232
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,378
{\an1}formed and its leader
named the Mizukage.

233
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:53,616
{\an1}And in the Land of Wind,
they founded the Hidden Sand

234
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:55,551
{\an1}Village and named their
leader the Kazekage.

235
00:17:55,584 --> 00:18:00,089
{\an1}Not only the Great Nations
but even the smaller ones

236
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:01,090
{\an1}adopted this system.

237
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:05,127
{\an1}The dream Madara and I
shared had come true.

238
00:18:08,398 --> 00:18:11,134
{\an1}Shinobi children got to
know about learning and

239
00:18:11,168 --> 00:18:14,538
{\an1}playing... instead of
merely knowing battle.

240
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:17,541
{\an1}And they started living
long enough to even

241
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:19,142
{\an1}know the taste of alcohol.

242
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:23,747
{\an1}But as if he wanted to
destroy his previous dream,

243
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,484
{\an1}Madara came back to
attack the Leaf Village.

244
00:18:28,418 --> 00:18:31,755
{\an1}You're going to lay waste
to everything? To all we've

245
00:18:31,788 --> 00:18:33,924
accomplished up
till now, Madara?

246
00:18:33,957 --> 00:18:37,361
{\an1}Nothing will come of us
battling each other. This

247
00:18:37,395 --> 00:18:40,897
{\an1}fight will only hurt
village and shinobi!

248
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:44,235
{\an1}This is disrespectful
toward our brothers

249
00:18:44,268 --> 00:18:45,735
{\an1}and our comrades!

250
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:48,573
You know nothing
of my-!

251
00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:50,775
I don't want to
have to kill you!

252
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:53,144
{\an1}Are you really implying
that you could take

253
00:18:53,177 --> 00:18:53,978
{\an1}me down at any time?

254
00:18:54,011 --> 00:18:56,447
I'm not! I mean
we're friends!

255
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,651
{\an1}Enough of all this!
I've already reached it!

256
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:02,019
[angry roar]

257
00:19:03,522 --> 00:19:05,257
{\an1}Then so be it...
