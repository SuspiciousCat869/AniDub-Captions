1
00:00:11,914 --> 00:00:13,480
{\an1}-Why would she do
something like that?

2
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:21,450
{\an1}SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Hinata.

3
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:39,388
You really love
Naruto, don't you?

4
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:43,422
{\an1}-Naruto was able to suppress
the Nine Tails all on his own.

5
00:00:43,456 --> 00:00:46,122
{\an1}SAKURA (VOICEOVER): He was?

6
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:49,390
{\an1}-And now he's just about to
go up against the final Pain.

7
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:55,259
-Lee.

8
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:56,792
{\an1}We're gonna back up Naruto.

9
00:00:56,826 --> 00:00:57,627
Let's go.

10
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,026
-Right.

11
00:00:59,059 --> 00:00:59,760
{\an1}KATSUYU: No, wait.

12
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,895
Please don't.

13
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,528
{\an1}You'll only get in
his way if you do.

14
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:06,529
-But he-- Pain
destroyed the Leaf.

15
00:01:06,562 --> 00:01:08,596
{\an1}Naruto cannot do this alone.

16
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,530
{\an1}-Naruto has a plan
he intends to follow.

17
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:14,731
{\an1}Let's put our faith in him.

18
00:01:14,764 --> 00:01:18,532
{\an1}-You, with no answers and
no solutions, just give up!

19
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:27,701
{\an1}He withstood that?

20
00:01:27,735 --> 00:01:28,668
Can't be.

21
00:01:39,504 --> 00:01:41,405
{\an1}PAIN (VOICEOVER: He
can't throw that jutsu.

22
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:43,539
{\an1}I've got five seconds.

23
00:01:43,572 --> 00:01:46,106
{\an1}This distance will keep me safe.

24
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:46,606
-Look.

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,806
Pain.

26
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,875
{\an1}Just give up on trying
to make me give up!

27
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:53,375
Rasengan!

28
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:29,118
{\an1}-What has happened?

29
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:35,452
{\an1}-The final remaining
Pain has been broken.

30
00:02:38,987 --> 00:02:41,922
[theme music]

31
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:02,527
{\an1}-These rods were how all of
the pains got their chakra.

32
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:18,764
{\an1}If I take them out, he shouldn't
be able to move anymore.

33
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:34,003
{\an1}-The two of us are both
seeking the very same thing.

34
00:05:34,036 --> 00:05:37,235
{\an1}To achieve the peace that
Jiraiya-sensei envisioned.

35
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:39,170
{\an1}You and I are the same.

36
00:05:39,203 --> 00:05:44,005
{\an1}We're both motivated by our
desire for peace and justice.

37
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:46,639
{\an1}You strive for your
own sense of justice,

38
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:49,807
{\an1}and I strive for my
own version of it.

39
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:56,609
{\an1}So, do you finally
comprehend pain now?

40
00:05:56,642 --> 00:05:59,241
{\an1}Unless you come to know
the exact same pain,

41
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,876
you can't truly
comprehend someone else.

42
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,243
And even if you
comprehend them, you still

43
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:06,044
{\an1}may not truly understand them.

44
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:27,350
{\an1}It's a vicious cycle of
hated with our future

45
00:06:27,383 --> 00:06:30,018
{\an1}being the same as
our past, so we

46
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:33,352
{\an1}believe that human beings simply
can't understand each other,

47
00:06:33,385 --> 00:06:35,585
{\an1}and they never will.

48
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:38,886
{\an1}The shinobi world of
ours is ruled by hatred,

49
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,120
{\an1}and by hatred alone.

50
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:57,191
-Are you going?

51
00:06:57,224 --> 00:06:59,559
-Yeah.

52
00:06:59,592 --> 00:07:01,593
{\an1}-Then you'll need
reinforcements.

53
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:02,693
-No.

54
00:07:02,727 --> 00:07:04,293
No one else.

55
00:07:04,326 --> 00:07:05,061
I'm going alone.

56
00:07:16,664 --> 00:07:17,597
-Lady Hinata!

57
00:07:21,932 --> 00:07:23,799
{\an1}-You're all here.

58
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,000
-Thank goodness.

59
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:26,199
We were worried.

60
00:07:26,232 --> 00:07:26,934
-Yes Hinata.

61
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:27,934
Are you OK?

62
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:34,469
-Thank you guys.

63
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:36,268
All of you.

64
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:37,202
Especially you.

65
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:38,603
Thanks, Sakura.

66
00:07:38,637 --> 00:07:40,236
{\an1}-I'm so relieved.

67
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:43,804
{\an1}It's good to have you back.

68
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,771
-Everyone.

69
00:07:44,805 --> 00:07:46,905
{\an1}Naruto has defeated
the last Pain!

70
00:07:49,873 --> 00:07:50,539
-Yes!

71
00:07:50,573 --> 00:07:52,040
{\an1}Just leave it to Naruto.

72
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:53,574
{\an1}-How is Naruto doing?

73
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,173
{\an1}Is he injured at all?

74
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:59,576
-Well, he's very
fatigued, but he's OK.

75
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:02,542
{\an1}HINATA (VOICEOVER):
Such good news.

76
00:08:02,576 --> 00:08:05,944
{\an1}I'm so glad, Naruto.

77
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:08,778
{\an1}-So, where is Naruto now?

78
00:08:08,811 --> 00:08:13,445
{\an1}-He's going by himself to
where the real Pain is.

79
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:15,880
{\an1}-And why would you do
something so reckless?

80
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,246
{\an1}Please, Guy-sensei.

81
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,514
{\an1}We have to follow him.

82
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:19,681
-Right.

83
00:08:19,714 --> 00:08:20,848
-Wait.

84
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:23,582
Naruto said he
doesn't want any help.

85
00:08:23,615 --> 00:08:24,482
-What?

86
00:08:24,515 --> 00:08:25,750
He doesn't?

87
00:08:25,783 --> 00:08:27,017
-I don't care!

88
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,450
{\an1}He's done enough alone.

89
00:08:28,484 --> 00:08:30,584
{\an1}And besides, he's
weakened right now.

90
00:08:30,617 --> 00:08:32,385
{\an1}Lady Katsuyu, lead us to Naruto.

91
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:41,320
{\an1}-Ko, what do you see?

92
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:42,286
{\an1}-Naruto's up ahead.

93
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:50,123
Naruto!

94
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:57,558
{\an1}-What's up, masters?

95
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,093
{\an1}-The fact that you're
here by yourself.

96
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:03,526
Does that mean
that you've finally

97
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,861
{\an1}defeated the sixth Pain?

98
00:09:11,428 --> 00:09:14,529
{\an1}-It doesn't really matter
who won or who lost.

99
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:25,332
{\an1}-Tell us what happened.

100
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,800
-I don't know.

101
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,366
{\an1}It's hard to explain.

102
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,401
-I'm sorry.

103
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:31,801
{\an1}I don't understand.

104
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:35,268
{\an1}What do you mean by that?

105
00:09:35,301 --> 00:09:37,268
{\an1}-It's not really important.

106
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:40,870
{\an1}I'm on my way to see
the real Pain right now.

107
00:09:40,903 --> 00:09:44,038
{\an1}And please, don't
try to follow me.

108
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:45,304
{\an1}I need to go on alone.

109
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,975
-Naruto.

110
00:09:59,008 --> 00:10:01,409
{\an1}Have you figured out where
the real Pain can be found?

111
00:10:01,442 --> 00:10:02,809
-Yeah.

112
00:10:02,842 --> 00:10:06,077
{\an1}When I was still in Sage mode,
I pulled one of those black rids

113
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,711
{\an1}from Pain's body, and
then I traced his chakra.

114
00:10:09,744 --> 00:10:10,779
{\an1}-Yes, I understand.

115
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:13,512
But why is it so
important to go on alone?

116
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:16,746
{\an1}What's going on, Naruto?

117
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,280
{\an1}-There's something
I wanna check out.

118
00:10:19,313 --> 00:10:20,714
{\an1}-Check something out?

119
00:10:20,747 --> 00:10:21,581
{\an1}And what is that?

120
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,849
{\an1}-I want to talk to him.

121
00:10:25,883 --> 00:10:27,282
The real Pain.

122
00:10:27,315 --> 00:10:31,483
{\an1}-What/ You're just talking
nonsense now, Naruto.

123
00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:32,851
{\an1}Don't get me wrong.

124
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:35,952
{\an1}We're all grateful that you
defeated pain, but just talk?

125
00:10:35,986 --> 00:10:36,719
No!

126
00:10:36,752 --> 00:10:38,886
{\an1}It's too late for that.

127
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,120
-Then tell me.

128
00:10:40,154 --> 00:10:43,155
{\an1}If we go and destroy the
real Pain, all his minions,

129
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:45,821
{\an1}his village, and everything
else, would that settle things?

130
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,089
{\an1}-And what good will
talking to him do?

131
00:10:48,122 --> 00:10:51,057
{\an1}Pain is an enemy who
destroyed the whole Leaf.

132
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,023
{\an1}We can never forgive him!

133
00:10:53,057 --> 00:10:54,357
-Yeah, I know.

134
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,323
{\an1}I feel the same way as you do.

135
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:57,758
{\an1}You think I forgive him?

136
00:10:57,792 --> 00:11:00,191
{\an1}I wanna crush him for
what he did to our village

137
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:01,492
and to everyone!

138
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:02,359
-Then why do it?

139
00:11:02,392 --> 00:11:02,859
-Inoichi.

140
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,561
{\an1}Let's respect Naruto's
wishes and just let

141
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:10,162
{\an1}him go on ahead alone.

142
00:11:10,194 --> 00:11:13,228
{\an1}-Shikaku, what are you--

143
00:11:13,262 --> 00:11:15,562
{\an1}-He's the one who
stopped the other Pains,

144
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:19,397
{\an1}so I think he has a right
to speak to the real one.

145
00:11:19,431 --> 00:11:22,297
{\an1}Besides, I'm sure he's
got something special

146
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,565
{\an1}in mind for this meeting.

147
00:11:23,598 --> 00:11:24,498
-Yeah, but--

148
00:11:24,532 --> 00:11:25,732
-That's enough.

149
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:26,632
Just let him go.

150
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,934
{\an1}-Thank you, Mr. Shikaku.

151
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:40,703
{\an1}-Shikaku, why did you agree
to let him go without us?

152
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:45,337
{\an1}-Because of my son.

153
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:45,971
-What you mean?

154
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:54,339
{\an1}SHIKAKU: Where'd you go?

155
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:57,340
{\an1}Black Ops sent a message for
you, but you weren't here.

156
00:11:57,374 --> 00:12:00,909
{\an1}SHIKAMARU: Well, I
went to lecture Naruto,

157
00:12:00,942 --> 00:12:02,942
{\an1}to tell him not to
be all depressed.

158
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,377
{\an1}It was a drag, but I
couldn't help myself.

159
00:12:16,846 --> 00:12:21,481
{\an1}That kid's got something
that no one else has.

160
00:12:21,514 --> 00:12:23,581
{\an1}SHIKAKU: Something?

161
00:12:23,614 --> 00:12:24,715
-Yeah.

162
00:12:24,748 --> 00:12:26,348
{\an1}He's going to become a
very important shinobi

163
00:12:26,382 --> 00:12:27,816
{\an1}for this village someday.

164
00:12:27,849 --> 00:12:30,750
I'm sure of it.

165
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,784
When I'm with
Naruto, he makes me

166
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:36,919
{\an1}wanna follow him,
to walk by his side.

167
00:12:36,952 --> 00:12:38,385
No matter what.

168
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:46,855
{\an1}-Shikamaru rarely praises
anyone, but he said that to me.

169
00:12:46,888 --> 00:12:49,455
{\an1}There's really something
special about Naruto.

170
00:12:49,488 --> 00:12:50,789
{\an1}I believe in him now.

171
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,390
{\an1}That's why we should
put our faith in Naruto.

172
00:13:36,768 --> 00:13:37,468
-Konan.

173
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:39,535
{\an1}Stay out of this.

174
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,069
-But Nagato--

175
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:41,870
-It's all right.

176
00:13:51,106 --> 00:13:52,239
-Are you him?

177
00:13:52,272 --> 00:13:53,239
{\an1}Are you the real Pain?

178
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:08,310
{\an1}-So the peacemaker comes
stumbling in at last.

179
00:14:24,314 --> 00:14:26,882
{\an1}Tell me, do you hate me now?

180
00:14:26,915 --> 00:14:29,583
{\an1}I'm the object of your vendetta.

181
00:14:29,616 --> 00:14:31,950
Do you wish to
exact revenge on me?

182
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,651
{\an1}-And trigger a vicious
cycle of hatred.

183
00:14:38,685 --> 00:14:42,552
{\an1}But you see, that is why
I formed the Akatsuki.

184
00:14:42,586 --> 00:14:44,221
{\an1}To break the cycle of hatred.

185
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:49,488
{\an1}-Killing Nagato and
achieving vengeance

186
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,756
{\an1}isn't going to do a single
thing to change the world.

187
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:59,691
{\an1}You will only get
personal satisfaction

188
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:02,059
{\an1}-As long as we have
this ninja system,

189
00:15:02,092 --> 00:15:04,258
{\an1}this monster called
hate will live,

190
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,093
{\an1}and it will give birth
to more Pains like him.

191
00:15:07,127 --> 00:15:09,861
{\an1}To be a ninja means that
you must confront hatred,

192
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:14,561
{\an1}and every one of us must
battle against that hatred.

193
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:17,462
{\an1}Jiraiya-sensei bequeathed
to you the quest

194
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:21,097
{\an1}for the solution that
would end this hatred.

195
00:15:21,131 --> 00:15:23,631
{\an1}-If you could not
find the answer,

196
00:15:23,664 --> 00:15:25,731
{\an1}then there's nothing
more you can do.

197
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:29,265
{\an1}So do the just thing and
simply sacrifice yourself

198
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:32,633
{\an1}to me, and to the piece
that I shall soon construct.

199
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:57,507
{\an1}From this short distance, I'm
able to completely manipulate

200
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,508
{\an1}your every move with my chakra.

201
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,541
But don't worry.

202
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:04,375
{\an1}I've avoided your vital
spots, because you're

203
00:16:04,408 --> 00:16:05,876
{\an1}invaluable to me, Jinchuriki.

204
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,183
{\an1}-What's wrong, Nagato?

205
00:16:31,216 --> 00:16:32,316
What is it?

206
00:16:37,718 --> 00:16:41,652
{\an1}-He deliberately let me.

207
00:16:41,685 --> 00:16:45,753
{\an1}-I came here intending
to talk to you.

208
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:50,320
{\an1}But I also wanted to
check something out.

209
00:16:50,354 --> 00:16:51,989
-Check out what?

210
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:57,757
-I wanted to see
how I would actually

211
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:03,992
{\an1}feel if I stood before my
enemy I wondered what I'd do.

212
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:07,726
I didn't even
really know myself.

213
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,226
-And?

214
00:17:14,195 --> 00:17:17,129
{\an1}-And I really can't forgive you!

215
00:17:17,163 --> 00:17:20,797
{\an1}I want to kill you so
badly I can't stop shaking!

216
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,597
{\an1}KONAN (VOICEOVER): What?

217
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:29,498
{\an1}He can resist Nagato's
chakra up close like this?

218
00:17:43,903 --> 00:17:47,070
{\an1}-Even I'm able to see that
there's entirely too much

219
00:17:47,104 --> 00:17:50,138
{\an1}hate in the shinobi
world of ours.

220
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:52,138
{\an1}You know, I've always
wanted to do something

221
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:55,039
{\an1}about all this hatred,
but I'm just not

222
00:17:55,072 --> 00:17:57,540
{\an1}quite sure how to go
about it all as of yet.

223
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:03,608
I'm very glad I
made you my student.

224
00:18:13,211 --> 00:18:15,645
-Pervy Sage said
he truly believed

225
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,746
{\an1}that the day would
come when everyone

226
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:19,813
{\an1}would understand one another.

227
00:18:19,846 --> 00:18:23,814
{\an1}To tell you the truth, I wasn't
really paying much attention

228
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:26,481
{\an1}to what he was saying.

229
00:18:26,514 --> 00:18:30,949
{\an1}He said he would pass
on his quest to me.

230
00:18:30,982 --> 00:18:33,716
{\an1}I was just excited that
he was complimenting me

231
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,384
as his student.

232
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:39,185
{\an1}Thinking back now,
I finally understand

233
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,552
{\an1}what he was trying to say.

234
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:44,953
{\an1}That nothing in this
world is that simple.

235
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:48,188
{\an1}-However, that still doesn't
change the fact that you cannot

236
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:49,188
forgive me.

237
00:18:49,221 --> 00:18:51,988
{\an1}Human love is not so
worthless that you

238
00:18:52,022 --> 00:18:54,923
{\an1}can sweep it under the rug.

239
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:56,322
-Yeah.

240
00:18:56,355 --> 00:18:59,456
{\an1}You're right about
that, that's for sure.

241
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,424
{\an1}-Jiraiya-sensei's words
reflect an idealism

242
00:19:02,457 --> 00:19:04,791
{\an1}from an era that is long gone.

243
00:19:04,825 --> 00:19:07,458
{\an1}Reality is too different.

244
00:19:07,492 --> 00:19:09,726
{\an1}I thought you said
you would take me down

245
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,794
{\an1}and that you'd bring peace
to the shinobi world.

246
00:19:17,628 --> 00:19:19,930
{\an1}But those are just
more empty words.

247
00:19:19,963 --> 00:19:23,530
{\an1}All you really want is to exact
your own personal revenge.

248
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:28,065
{\an1}If that's your idea of
justice, then so be it.

249
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:30,699
{\an1}You are not a god.

250
00:19:30,732 --> 00:19:34,033
{\an1}Now that you see reality for
what it is, can you truly

251
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:36,100
still believe in
Jiraiya-sensei's

252
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:40,768
{\an1}ridiculous words and
outdated thoughts.

253
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:44,569
{\an1}When I found out that you'd
been Pervy Sage's students too,

254
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:48,336
{\an1}I thought of something that
I'd been wanting to ask you.

255
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:49,537
-What?

256
00:19:49,571 --> 00:19:51,704
{\an1}-How is it possible that
you were all his students

257
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:55,072
{\an1}and still ended up
the way you are now?

258
00:19:55,105 --> 00:19:58,573
{\an1}I can see that you're not like
those other Akatsuki, the ones

259
00:19:58,606 --> 00:20:02,174
who just seemed
to enjoy killing.

260
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:07,243
{\an1}But I still-- I don't really
know anything about you yet.

261
00:20:07,276 --> 00:20:11,010
{\an1}So, I need to hear your stories.

262
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,577
{\an1}Then I'll give you
my final response.

263
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:17,544
-Very well.

264
00:20:17,578 --> 00:20:20,645
{\an1}We'll tell you everything
about our pain.

{\an1}I heard that when
