The only reason I'm here

don't go any further
down that road, got it?

An evil demon lives

like some kind of

to fix about himself?

Not at all.

If you start to lose control,
then I'll be your cage.

your side, then

-That's right.

165
00:11:08,013 --> 00:11:10,346
I'm simply going to take
the enzyme from your body

166
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,746
and absorb it into mine.

00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:15,613
the power of the Curse Mark.

169
00:11:15,646 --> 00:11:16,946
-Wait, hold on.

170
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:20,613
The Curse Mark isn't compatible
with all who absorb it.

171
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,579
If it isn't
compatible with you--

172
00:11:22,613 --> 00:11:24,313
-I know.

173
00:11:24,346 --> 00:11:26,613
If it doesn't, then I will die.

174
00:11:26,646 --> 00:11:29,446
-If you know that,
then you can't do this!

175
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,646
-It's part of the
treatment for both of us.

176
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,779
The disease I carry is
slowly eating away my body.

177
00:11:34,813 --> 00:11:36,946
But if your Curse
Mark works, it could

178
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:40,246
slow the disease's
progress indefinitely.

179
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:44,246
Your power could save me, Jugo.

180
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,113
Please, Jugo, don't
worry about me.

181
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:47,646
I'll be just fine.

182
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,579
We're best friends, after all.

183
00:11:50,613 --> 00:11:54,579
I'm absolutely sure there's no
way your power would reject me.

184
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:57,013
JUGO (VOICEOVER): Kimimaro, why?

185
00:11:57,046 --> 00:12:01,513
Why did you die and
leave me all alone?

186
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:04,613
-[laughs]

187
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:05,079
Aah!

188
00:12:12,646 --> 00:12:15,113
Who are you?

189
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:16,613
-You're using a
different technique

190
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:17,946
than you did before, Jugo.

191
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:19,346
Not too bad.

192
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:20,246
I like it.

193
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,013
-Stop, Suigetsu.

194
00:12:22,046 --> 00:12:23,179
-Yes, of course.

195
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:25,046
We fought before, Suigetsu.

196
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,979
I remember now.

197
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:30,513
-You know, this guy really
is dangerous, Sasuke.

198
00:12:30,546 --> 00:12:31,913
-Sasuke?

199
00:12:31,946 --> 00:12:35,013
-We didn't come here
to fight, Suigetsu.

200
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,279
Just let me talk to him.

201
00:12:36,313 --> 00:12:38,079
-I seriously doubt
anything you say

202
00:12:38,113 --> 00:12:39,379
is going to get through to him.

203
00:12:39,413 --> 00:12:41,879
The only thing he
understands is force!

204
00:12:41,913 --> 00:12:42,379
-Aah!

205
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:47,713
-Aah!

206
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:49,079
-Stop it, both of you!

207
00:12:49,113 --> 00:12:50,479
KARIN (VOICEOVER):
No, don't stop!

208
00:12:50,513 --> 00:12:52,213
Kill each other off!

209
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:53,146
-Yaah!

210
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:53,646
-Aah!

211
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,579
-Do you both want
me to kill you?

212
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,079
Is that it?

213
00:13:08,546 --> 00:13:10,479
[hissing]

214
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:22,579
SUIGETSU (VOICEOVER): He really
was about to kill us just now.

215
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:24,713
KARIN (VOICEOVER): Oh, Sasuke.

216
00:13:24,746 --> 00:13:26,013
You're incredible.

217
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,213
-Huh?

218
00:13:35,246 --> 00:13:38,646
[gasps]

219
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,146
Aah!

220
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,246
Aah!

221
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,913
Please just hurry
and lock the door!

222
00:13:48,946 --> 00:13:51,413
-Jugo, I mean you no harm.

223
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:53,346
I only came to free you.

224
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:54,946
Please come out and join me.

225
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:57,046
-I think he's too frightened.

226
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:57,746
-You're wrong.

227
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,013
That's not it at all.

228
00:14:02,046 --> 00:14:04,046
-(WHIMPERS) I don't want
to kill any more people.

229
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,579
If I go outside
this place, I will.

230
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:09,446
I'm begging you, just
leave me alone, please!

231
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:10,413
-What?

232
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:11,479
How weird!

233
00:14:11,513 --> 00:14:13,613
That's some split
personality right there.

234
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:17,146
-I told you, Jugo succumbs to
his irrepressible murderous

235
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:17,946
urges.

236
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:19,813
And it's like he's someone else.

237
00:14:19,846 --> 00:14:21,913
He loses control of himself.

238
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:26,013
But the truth is, he'd
actually rather not kill.

239
00:14:26,046 --> 00:14:28,546
-I don't know when I'll lose
control and kill someone again.

240
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:32,379
So just put the lock on
the door and leave me be!

241
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,579
-I don't think Jugo's
going to work out, Sasuke.

242
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:38,279
We're constantly going to have
to watch our backs around him

243
00:14:38,313 --> 00:14:39,813
in case he starts
to lose control.

244
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:42,546
-Who the hell are
you people anyway?

245
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:44,713
I just want to be left alone!

246
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:54,779
-Orochimaru is dead.

247
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:57,313
This hideout is
completely destroyed.

248
00:14:57,346 --> 00:14:59,913
If you stay here,
you'll die, too.

249
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:01,713
-I don't care.

250
00:15:01,746 --> 00:15:05,346
At least, then, I could
never kill anybody else.

251
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:06,946
-Listen to me.

252
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:10,679
Don't worry, I'll
be your cage, Jugo.

253
00:15:10,713 --> 00:15:14,613
I can keep you under control.

254
00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:16,346
JUGO: There's
nothing you can do.

255
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:21,679
Only one person could subdue
my impulses-- Kimimaro.

256
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:26,479
Without Kimimaro, I won't leave.

257
00:15:26,513 --> 00:15:28,079
-Wait, Kimimaro?

258
00:15:28,113 --> 00:15:30,213
You mean the guy
from the Kaguya clan?

259
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:31,279
-Yeah.

260
00:15:31,313 --> 00:15:33,146
Of all the people
here, Jugo and Kimimaro

261
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:35,546
were Orochimaru's favorites.

262
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,713
They were kept here
together, right here

263
00:15:37,746 --> 00:15:40,413
in this hideout for
live experimentation.

264
00:15:40,446 --> 00:15:42,979
And Kimimaro was very strong.

265
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:46,213
He was the only one who could
stop Jugo's violent rampages

266
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:47,546
without harming him.

267
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,346
Orochimaru's precious
research subject.

268
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:54,846
-But I thought Kimimaro
was-- isn't he dead?

269
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,979
-Yeah.

270
00:15:56,013 --> 00:16:00,246
-Jugo, you should know
Kimimaro died for me.

271
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,513
He's gone.

272
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:02,746
-Uh.

273
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:04,813
Wait a second.

274
00:16:04,846 --> 00:16:07,679
If he did that
for you, then that

275
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:11,646
must mean that you're Uchiha.

276
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,779
Sasuke Uchiha.

277
00:16:14,813 --> 00:16:16,513
-That's right.

278
00:16:16,546 --> 00:16:20,746
-So you've come, Sasuke.

279
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,313
No, you can't go on
a mission, you're

280
00:16:22,346 --> 00:16:24,279
too sick for that, aren't you?

281
00:16:24,313 --> 00:16:26,046
This has never happened before.

282
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,579
-It's Sasuke Uchiha.

283
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,946
He's the one who's going to take
my place as Lord Orochimaru's

284
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:33,379
vessel.

285
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:36,013
My goal is to retrieve him.

286
00:16:36,046 --> 00:16:39,179
-Can he really be worth
risking your own life for?

287
00:16:39,213 --> 00:16:41,513
-Sasuke Uchiha and
I are the only ones

288
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:45,479
worthy of becoming a
vessel for Lord Orochimaru.

289
00:16:45,513 --> 00:16:49,813
In a way, Sasuke is
like my reincarnation.

290
00:16:49,846 --> 00:16:53,246
I will sacrifice
myself to retrieve him.

291
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,713
I'm very grateful to you, Jugo.

292
00:16:56,746 --> 00:17:00,813
Your strength has made me
even stronger than before.

293
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:03,013
All right, then, Jugo.

294
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:04,446
I'll be back soon.

295
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:15,913
JUGO (VOICEOVER): So that's
what happened, Kimimaro.

296
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:29,646
-Good.

297
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,879
Now that I've gathered my
perfect team, here it is.

298
00:17:33,913 --> 00:17:34,813
This is my plan.

299
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:44,446
My ultimate goal is to kill
Itachi Uchiha of the Akatsuki.

300
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:48,113
-I thought you were
going to say that.

301
00:17:48,146 --> 00:17:49,479
KARIN (VOICEOVER):
Itachi Uchiha?

302
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:52,179
But that's his own brother.

303
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:55,146
-But to succeed, I'll
need help from all of you.

304
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:57,646
Of course, it's your choice.

305
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,379
Karin, you said you had
something else to do.

306
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,413
Decide.

307
00:18:02,446 --> 00:18:05,646
-Uh, oh, uh, well,
on second thought,

308
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,979
that other thing really
isn't all that important.

309
00:18:08,013 --> 00:18:11,479
-Karin, just be honest and
tell the truth, would you?

310
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:13,313
The only thing you're
really interested in

311
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:15,546
is being around Sasuke,
isn't that right?

312
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:16,279
-What?

313
00:18:16,313 --> 00:18:17,679
No, that's just ridiculous!

314
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:20,446
It's ridiculous how
ridiculous that is!

315
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:22,313
No, you're ridiculous!

316
00:18:22,346 --> 00:18:23,613
-What I am is right.

317
00:18:23,646 --> 00:18:25,846
I mean, why else would you
get all flustered like that?

318
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:27,413
Ha-ha, rich!

319
00:18:27,446 --> 00:18:30,479
I know the truth, you
know, about how long ago

320
00:18:30,513 --> 00:18:33,913
you want it so-- [grunts]

321
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,013
-Suigetsu, don't
get Karin worked up.

322
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:40,146
Didn't I tell you
to try to get along?

323
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:41,913
-All right, I will.

324
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:44,579
I'm sorry, Karin, truly.

325
00:18:44,613 --> 00:18:48,313
Now, look, you may hate it,
but I'm not going anywhere.

326
00:18:48,346 --> 00:18:50,679
I'm sticking like
glue to Sasuke.

327
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,346
At least, I am until I can
locate one of the seven Hidden

328
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:54,579
Mist Blades.

329
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:57,279
I'm on the hunt for Kisame
Hoshigaki's giant sword,

330
00:18:57,313 --> 00:19:00,279
the Shark Skin Samehada.

331
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:02,879
-So you're collecting
a bunch of big swords?

332
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:05,613
How boring.

333
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:07,013
-Suigetsu?

334
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,679
-Yeah, I know.

335
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:11,346
Jugo, what are you going to do?

336
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:15,313
-Kimimaro said he considered
you his reincarnation, Sasuke,

337
00:19:15,346 --> 00:19:18,213
and sacrificed his
life to protect you.

338
00:19:18,246 --> 00:19:20,346
So that's why I want to
see what kind of shinobi

339
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:23,013
you really are with my own eyes.

340
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:27,813
-Then it's all set.

341
00:19:32,613 --> 00:19:34,513
-What is Sasuke thinking?

342
00:19:34,546 --> 00:19:36,779
If Orochimaru's
dead now, then why

343
00:19:36,813 --> 00:19:39,446
won't Sasuke come
back to the village?

344
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:42,513
-Sasuke is simply
obsessed with vengeance.

345
00:19:42,546 --> 00:19:45,179
We believe that he intends to
approach the Akatsuki in order

346
00:19:45,213 --> 00:19:47,913
to kill his older
brother, Itachi.

347
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:49,546
-That old thing again?

348
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:51,146
Sasuke, damn it!

349
00:19:55,646 --> 00:19:58,013
-Now, that we're a team, we
all move together as one.

350
00:19:58,046 --> 00:20:03,179
And from this point on, we
will be known as the Hebi.

351
00:20:03,213 --> 00:20:05,346
-Well, we have to
move fast then.

352
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:09,013
Operation Track Akatsuki
is still going on, right?

353
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:10,046
-It is.

354
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,113
-All right.

355
00:20:11,146 --> 00:20:13,213
Then to find Sasuke,
we need to hunt down

356
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,079
that member of the
Akatsuki first.

357
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,013
We got to find that guy quick.

358
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:19,446
-The Hebi has only one goal--

359
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:21,879
-So then, our target is--

360
00:20:21,913 --> 00:20:22,446
--Itachi--

361
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:22,946
---Uchiha.

362
00:20:31,587 --> 00:20:34,454
[music playing]

363
00:22:01,952 --> 00:22:03,652
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
I'll tell you a story

364
00:22:03,685 --> 00:22:06,652
from when I was just a kid,
back during the final days

365
00:22:06,685 --> 00:22:08,785
of the Third Great Ninja War.

366
00:22:08,818 --> 00:22:11,152
Due to the prolonged
conflict with other nations,

367
00:22:11,185 --> 00:22:14,118
the Hidden Leaf Village faced
an unprecedented shortage

368
00:22:14,152 --> 00:22:16,018
of combat capability.

369
00:22:16,052 --> 00:22:18,252
It was during that
dark uncertain time

370
00:22:18,285 --> 00:22:20,018
that this story takes place.

371
00:22:20,052 --> 00:22:24,252
It was my very first
mission as a Jonin.

372
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:27,218
Next time, "Kakashi
Chronicles-- a Boy's Life

373
00:22:27,252 --> 00:22:33,652
on the Battlefield, Part 1."

374
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,652
-Lady Katsuyu,
may I talk to you?

375
00:22:35,685 --> 00:22:37,052
-Of course.

376
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:39,485
SAKURA: How did you ever make
it here to join the rest of us?

377
00:22:39,518 --> 00:22:41,152
-Oh, that's quite a tale.

378
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:44,485
-So please, you must join Sakura
just as quickly as possible.

379
00:22:44,518 --> 00:22:45,485
-But quickly?

380
00:22:45,518 --> 00:22:46,285
TSUNADE: No "buts"!

381
00:22:46,318 --> 00:22:47,252
Everyone is waiting!

382
00:22:47,285 --> 00:22:49,152
-Yes, I understand.

383
00:22:49,185 --> 00:22:52,518
It's just that I
can't walk very fast.

384
00:22:52,552 --> 00:22:54,785
Oh!

385
00:22:54,818 --> 00:22:55,685
I must overcome this.

386
00:22:55,718 --> 00:22:57,518
They're all waiting for me.

387
00:22:57,552 --> 00:23:00,752
Oh, no, the sunlight,
it's drying me out.

388
00:23:00,785 --> 00:23:01,452
-Run!

389
00:23:01,485 --> 00:23:02,418
-It's a slug monster!

390
00:23:02,452 --> 00:23:02,885
-Quick!

391
00:23:02,918 --> 00:23:03,685
Salt!

392
00:23:03,718 --> 00:23:04,618
-Please, wait!

393
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:06,052
I'm not a mad slug.

394
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,485
I'm a-- ooh!

395
00:23:07,518 --> 00:23:08,852
-You went through all of that?

396
00:23:08,885 --> 00:23:11,152
-Oh, but my struggles were
nothing compared to yours.

397
00:23:11,185 --> 00:23:13,385
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): No,
that's simply not true at all.

398
00:23:13,418 --> 00:23:16,185
In fact, we owe you an apology
for what you've been through.

399
00:23:16,218 --> 00:23:18,918
-Naruto, apologize
to her right now!

400
00:23:18,952 --> 00:23:19,552
-What for?

401
00:23:19,585 --> 00:23:20,518
-You too, Sai.

402
00:23:20,552 --> 00:23:21,318
-Yes.

403
00:23:21,352 --> 00:23:22,318
-Just kidding.

404
00:23:22,352 --> 00:23:24,152
Actually, Lady
Tsunade sent me there

405
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:28,052
using the Transportation
Technique. [giggles]

406
00:23:28,085 --> 00:23:30,385
TSUNADE: Sakura still
has a lot to learn.

407
00:23:30,418 --> 00:23:31,952
-Ahchoo!
