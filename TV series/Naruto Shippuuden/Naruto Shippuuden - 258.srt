{\an1}The test consists of,

{\an1}An anything-goes battle to get
your hands on these scrolls.

the Heaven Scroll.

will be trying to get
the Earth Scroll.

you'll be vying for.

Naruto!

151
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:50,608
{\an1}Sasuke!

152
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:52,812
Ah! Down!

153
00:11:57,785 --> 00:11:58,420
Rrrgh!

154
00:11:58,786 --> 00:11:59,620
Come and get it!

155
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:01,458
It's no use!

156
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,926
You'll only be
fighting illusions.

157
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:03,960
Huh??

158
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:05,796
It's Genjutsu,
all right.

159
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,767
{\an5}That gash
on Kabuto's
arm is real
enough.

160
00:12:09,434 --> 00:12:11,904
{\an1}That's true. But still,
Sasuke's right.

161
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,410
{\an1}Could be the real
enemy's in hiding.

162
00:12:16,043 --> 00:12:21,418
{\an4}Launching real attacks from
behind a smokescreen of
illusions, and coordinating
their movements with them,

163
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:25,923
{\an4}so that we're fooled
into thinking these
"Genjutsu Shinobi" are
the ones attacking us.

164
00:12:26,357 --> 00:12:28,360
{\an1}Well what are we gonna do,
just stand here?

165
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:30,729
{\an1}Let's go find these clowns
and take care of 'em!

166
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:32,766
Just hold on, Naruto.

167
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,003
{\an1}They'd like nothing more
than for us to go searching
blindly for them.

168
00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:37,406
U-Uhh!

169
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,244
All that we can do
is hold our ground
and fight them off.

170
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:46,051
{\an1}But if we get rid of them,
if we take out all the
illusions at once,

171
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:50,357
{\an1}When the caster throws their
kunai, then we'll be able to
see where they're hiding.

172
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:52,826
{\an1}I'll show 'em two can
play at this game.

173
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,996
{\an1}Shadow Clone Jutsu!

174
00:12:58,267 --> 00:12:59,835
{\an1}Huh? Shadow Clones!

175
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,638
Raaaagh!!

176
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:04,975
[fighting]

177
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:19,996
Yaahhh!

178
00:13:20,263 --> 00:13:26,505
<i>[fighting]</i>

180
00:13:36,084 --> 00:13:39,755
{\an1}Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
We've crushed their spirits.

181
00:13:40,757 --> 00:13:43,094
{\an1}<i>Now all that's left</i>
<i>is their bodies.</i>

182
00:13:44,062 --> 00:13:45,630
<i>Lucky us.</i>

183
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:53,342
{\an1}You. I know you.
You're the one who cut
me on the shoulder.

184
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:59,115
{\an1}Oh well, now I can finally
pay you back, with interest.

185
00:13:59,149 --> 00:13:59,984
Hrrm.

186
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:01,051
Huh??

187
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:03,455
{\an1}<i>[Sasuke]</i>
<i>Now who's the cornered rat?</i>

188
00:14:03,922 --> 00:14:04,656
Huh??

189
00:14:04,923 --> 00:14:06,593
Worked like
a charm,
Naruto!

190
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:09,530
{\an1}What?! It can't be!

191
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,300
{\an1}<i>If they're over there,</i>
<i>then who are they?</i>

192
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:14,203
Are you
confused?

193
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:16,906
{\an1}Sorry, it was was
the only way to get
you to come out.

194
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:22,214
{\an1}Don't tell me that
little brat--!
It's not possible!

195
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,218
The Shadow Clones
were only the
first part of it.

196
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,790
{\an1}My real trick was coming
up with clones for the
rest of my squad.

197
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:32,861
While our doubles did
all the fighting and
took the beating,

198
00:14:32,894 --> 00:14:35,298
we were safe and
sound, waiting for
you to show yourself.

199
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:38,936
{\an1}What do you think, guys?
I think our little plan worked.

200
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,939
{\an1}Now, it's our turn!

201
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:42,441
Egh! Unh!

202
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,376
Huh??

203
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,948
{\an1}Naruto, take a break for now;
you've used up too much Chakra.

204
00:14:48,349 --> 00:14:49,750
{\an1}Don't worry. I've got 'em.

205
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:58,929
{\an1}After all the work I just did,
I'm not gonna let you guys
have all the fun!

206
00:15:00,665 --> 00:15:04,404
{\an8}<i>Whoa. Is this</i>
<i>the same Naruto?</i>

207
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:13,048
{\an7}<i>To be able to pull off a Multi</i>
<i>Shadow Clone jutsu, transform</i>
<i>three of them into clones of us,</i>
<i>and still come out fighting.</i>

208
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:18,222
{\an7}<i>And on top of that,</i>
<i>to do all of this</i>
<i>on the fifth day.</i>

209
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:30,640
{\an1}[Anko]
First of all, congratulations
on finishing the second exam.

210
00:15:31,674 --> 00:15:36,013
{\an1}<i>Alright, now pay attention!</i>
<i>Lord Hokage is going to</i>
<i>explain the third exam to you!</i>

211
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:40,619
{\an7}<i>What happened? When</i>
<i>did he get this good?</i>

212
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:46,060
{\an7}<i>Without him, we wouldn't</i>
<i>have made it out of the</i>
<i>Forest of Death.</i>

213
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:50,466
{\an7}<i>I can't just dismiss</i>
<i>him anymore.</i>

214
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:53,269
Sasuke,
quit now before--

215
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:54,104
{\an1}Huh?

216
00:15:55,072 --> 00:15:56,807
Please.
I'm scared.

217
00:15:57,108 --> 00:16:00,246
{\an1}Come on, you know as well as
I do you're in no condition
to keep on fighting,

218
00:16:00,846 --> 00:16:01,615
{\an1}Shut up, Sakura!

219
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:04,017
You think I'm blind
or something?

220
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:06,454
{\an1}You think I don't see the
suffering you're going through?

221
00:16:10,225 --> 00:16:11,895
{\an1}This has nothing
to do with you.

222
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:18,771
{\an1}Listen, Sakura.
I already told you all
of this once before.

223
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,307
{\an1}I am an avenger.

224
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:25,714
{\an1}<i>For me, this is something</i>
<i>far more than just an exam.</i>

225
00:16:26,281 --> 00:16:29,786
{\an1}<i>Whether I become a Chunin or not</i>
<i>means less than nothing to me.</i>

226
00:16:30,286 --> 00:16:32,690
{\an1}"Am I as strong as I can be?"

227
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:36,395
{\an1}I can only find out by
fighting the strongest.
The best.

228
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:41,067
<i>And the best of the</i>
<i>best are all here.</i>

229
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:45,106
{\an1}This is my path,
and neither you nor anyone
else can change that.

230
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:47,376
{\an1}Man, you don't
know when to quit!

231
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:49,879
{\an1}What're you biting her
head off, for, you idiot?

232
00:16:49,912 --> 00:16:51,482
{\an1}It's just 'cuz she
cares about ya!

233
00:16:52,116 --> 00:16:52,950
Naruto.

234
00:16:53,183 --> 00:16:53,752
Huh?

235
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:58,592
{\an1}You're one of the ones I
want to fight the most.

236
00:16:59,158 --> 00:17:00,025
Huh??

237
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,169
Huh?

238
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:32,437
[Sasuke]
What's up?

239
00:17:33,271 --> 00:17:35,407
{\an1}Heh. So you finally showed up.

240
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:50,562
{\an1}Kakashi Sensei!
I want your help.
I need to get stronger!

241
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:58,071
{\an7}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>Hmm. This determination</i>
<i>of Sasuke's.</i>

242
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:00,975
{\an8}<i>He's dead serious.</i>

243
00:18:02,243 --> 00:18:05,548
{\an1}It's Naruto. He became
so strong so fast!

244
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:07,383
I just can't waste
any more time.

245
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:16,497
{\an7}<i>I see, so that's it. He finally</i>
<i>took notice of the immense power</i>
<i>that Naruto has at his disposal.</i>

246
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:20,936
{\an1}I have a goal, and to
achieve it, I need to
have more power.

247
00:18:21,503 --> 00:18:22,671
Okay.

248
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,645
{\an5}Well, Sasuke, you know
about the five types of
chakra and about Change
in Chakra Nature, right?

249
00:18:27,678 --> 00:18:28,312
{\an1}Yeah.

250
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:34,220
{\an1}Members of the Uchiha Clan
most often possess Fire Nature
and specialize in Fire Style.

251
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:37,157
{\an1}I already know that.
What's this about?

252
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:42,063
{\an1}Some shinobi are able to
affect more than one
Change in Chakra Nature.

253
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:44,635
{\an1}My Chakra Nature is lightning.

254
00:18:46,905 --> 00:18:51,877
{\an1}Sasuke, For a long time now,
I've had a suspicion that
you may be similar to me.

255
00:18:52,846 --> 00:18:56,651
First, I'd like to
verify what your
Chakra Nature is.

256
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:03,660
{\an1}Looks like I may be able to pass
my jutsu on to you after all.

257
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:09,367
{\an1}The unique jutsu,
of Kakashi the Copy Ninja.

258
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:20,816
{\an4}<i>[angry crowd, boos and hissing]</i>
<i>- Come on!! Boo!</i>
<i>- What's going on??</i>
<i>- We've been waiting all day!</i>

259
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:23,921
Dagh! What could
he be doing at a
time like this?!

260
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,389
Where is that
idiot, Huh?!

261
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:28,293
Hm?

262
00:19:29,896 --> 00:19:31,096
{\an3}Whoaa!

263
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,797
{\an1}Sorry we're late.
We hit a ton
of traffic.

264
00:19:58,835 --> 00:19:59,636
And you are?

265
00:20:00,637 --> 00:20:02,439
{\an1}I'm Sasuke Uchiha.

266
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:04,174
Sasuke!

267
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:07,680
Huh, so you decided
to show up after all.

268
00:20:08,414 --> 00:20:12,053
{\an1}I was betting you wouldn't come,
'cuz you knew sooner or later
you'd have to face me.

269
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:15,356
Well, don't get too
full of yourself.

270
00:20:15,891 --> 00:20:17,026
You're still a loser.

271
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,829
{\an1}Anyway, what
about you,
Naruto?

272
00:20:20,597 --> 00:20:21,398
{\an1}Tell me.

273
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,433
{\an1}Did you win?

274
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:23,869
You know it!

275
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:30,443
{\an1}Sorry if we kept you waiting.
But, um, how late are we?

276
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:35,483
{\an1}I mean, it's not like
Sasuke's, well, disqualified
or anything, right?

277
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:39,288
You know, you were so
late that we extended
the deadline for you.

278
00:20:39,589 --> 00:20:41,591
{\an1}No, he's not disqualified.

279
00:20:42,093 --> 00:20:44,697
{\an1}Oh, ho ho. That's a relief.

280
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:56,445
{\an1}Listen Sasuke,
don't lose to him.

281
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,048
Got it.

282
00:21:04,023 --> 00:21:06,625
{\an1}You're one of the ones I
want to fight the most.

283
00:21:08,428 --> 00:21:11,933
{\an1}Don't lose. 'cuz I want
to fight you myself.

284
00:21:13,135 --> 00:21:13,902
Got it.

285
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:03,049
{\an4}<i>[Sasuke]</i>
<i>I had no idea. I didn't</i>
<i>know Naruto fought</i>
<i>Orochimaru and the others.</i>

286
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,684
{\an1}<i>Or that he learned a new jutsu. </i>

287
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:09,625
{\an1}<i>Or that somehow, he's</i>
