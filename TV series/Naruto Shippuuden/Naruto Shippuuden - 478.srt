1
00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:10,030
Naruto...

2
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:12,765
{\an1}Just disappear, already...

3
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:16,035
{\an1}...and take our bond along with
you!

4
00:00:17,236 --> 00:00:24,176
(Explosion)

5
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:29,046
Huh

6
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:31,182
Sasuke wins.

7
00:00:31,882 --> 00:00:36,152
{\an1}Now, make the Unison Sign
So we can move on.

8
00:01:04,642 --> 00:01:05,610
(angry growl)

9
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:07,579
{\an1}You wanna go, you loser?!

10
00:01:14,218 --> 00:01:15,551
What's this?

11
00:01:18,354 --> 00:01:19,522
(Water Drop)

12
00:01:20,488 --> 00:01:21,958
Sasuke...

13
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,659
{\an7}if you and I fight each other...

14
00:01:26,328 --> 00:01:27,662
{\an8}...we both...

15
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:30,131
...will die!

16
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:22,092
{\an8}(Water drops)

17
00:03:24,126 --> 00:03:25,494
Am I dead?

18
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:29,131
{\an1}Everything feels strange so...

19
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:31,300
{\an1}Yeah, that must be what
happened...

20
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:34,735
Well...

21
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:37,071
...probably.

22
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:51,016
{\an1}Pitiful, huh?

23
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:52,616
huh?

24
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,456
{\an1}(Angry grumbling)

25
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:02,226
{\an1}You had Nine Tails, and
I was an Uchiha.

26
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:08,231
{\an1}We were ostracized by the
village and treated like
outcasts.

27
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:12,767
{\an1}We both resented the village
and everyone living in it...

28
00:04:14,635 --> 00:04:15,770
Right?

29
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:25,911
{\an1}You can't say that I'm wrong.

30
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:33,551
{\an1}You said I was like your
brother... And in that sense,
maybe we were brothers.

31
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:36,221
{\an1}No! You're completely wrong!

32
00:04:36,254 --> 00:04:38,956
Damn it!
You don't get it, do you?

33
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:09,949
{\an1}Sorry, Grandma Tsunade...

34
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:15,087
{\an1}I know that I promised...

35
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,122
{\an1}...I wouldn't die till...

36
00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:20,224
{\an1}...I became Hokage.

37
00:05:27,264 --> 00:05:30,467
{\an7}Oh, no! The Infinite
Tsukuyomi!

38
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,702
{\an7}This is bad! We can't release
the jutsu if we're gone, right?!

39
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:36,305
(chuckle)

40
00:05:36,338 --> 00:05:37,872
Huh?

41
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:41,608
{\an1}You're dead. And you're
worried about what happens to
the rest of the world?

42
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:46,013
{\an1}Yeah, of course! We can't
leave things like that!

43
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,848
{\an1}Sakura and Kakashi are still
there.

44
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,384
{\an1}They'll figure something out.

45
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,786
{\an1}I sure hope so...

46
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:58,857
Urgh.

47
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,360
(Pain)

48
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:03,260
Naruto...!

49
00:06:03,294 --> 00:06:04,095
{\an8}(Water Drop)

50
00:06:04,128 --> 00:06:05,529
Huh?

51
00:06:22,076 --> 00:06:24,512
{\an1}The Hokage, huh...?

52
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,285
Big brother...

53
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,956
{\an1}I bet pretty soon they're
gonna carve your Great Stone
Face up there!

54
00:06:38,224 --> 00:06:39,291
Ohh!?!

55
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:43,794
Uhh!...

56
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:45,829
Big Brother...?!

57
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:53,870
(shocked)

58
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:12,752
{\an1}Forgive me... Sasuke, But
this is it.

59
00:07:14,954 --> 00:07:18,757
{\an7}And whatever you do from here
on out, know this...

60
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:22,760
{\an1}No matter what, I will love you
always.

61
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:30,767
{\an8}(Rain)

62
00:07:31,602 --> 00:07:34,271
Big Brother...

63
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:38,707
{\an1}...I'll be seeing you... soon.

64
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:52,386
{\an8}(Water Drops)

65
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:54,354
{\an1}You've finally come to, huh?

66
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:56,623
(Pain)

67
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:00,725
(Water Drop)

68
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,827
{\an1}As you can see...

69
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:07,332
{\an1}If either of us moves too
much, we'll bleed out and die.

70
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:13,803
{\an1}Why do you go that far?! Why do
all that...?!

71
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:15,738
{\an1}...just to get in my way?!

72
00:08:18,907 --> 00:08:22,778
{\an1}I gained the power needed to
enter into the darkness.

73
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,448
{\an1}...and sever all ties...

74
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:30,685
{\an1}Naturally, everyone tried to
cut ties with me, too.

75
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,954
Except you...

76
00:08:33,987 --> 00:08:37,257
{\an1}You've never attempted
to cut me off.

77
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,959
{\an1}I'm the only one who can handle
all that hate.

78
00:08:39,992 --> 00:08:41,493
{\an1}Do you understand?

79
00:08:42,795 --> 00:08:46,398
{\an1}Why do you keep on ^ involving
yourself with me?

80
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:48,600
Heh

81
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:50,867
{\an1}You know that already.

82
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:53,571
{\an1}I mean, come on! Don't you?

83
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:55,973
{\an1}Your body can't move, but your
mouth sure can!

84
00:08:56,006 --> 00:08:57,541
Just answer me!

85
00:09:02,211 --> 00:09:04,313
{\an1}...Cuz you're my friend.

86
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:08,749
{\an1}I have had enough! What are
you?!

87
00:09:09,351 --> 00:09:11,386
{\an1}I'm your friend, Sasuke!

88
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,055
{\an1}Just what in the hell do you
want from me?

89
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:17,224
{\an1}Why are you so fixated on me?

90
00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:18,891
{\an1}Because you're my friend!

91
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:29,134
{\an1}You've told me that before.
But what exactly does that
mean to you?

92
00:09:30,968 --> 00:09:37,475
{\an1}You ask me to explain it, but
honestly, it's not like I really
understand it either.

93
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:40,410
Its just...

94
00:09:40,443 --> 00:09:45,848
{\an1}...when I see you take on
stuff... and get all messed up,
it...

95
00:09:47,982 --> 00:09:49,485
...kinda...

96
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:51,953
{\an1}...well, hurts me.

97
00:09:53,488 --> 00:10:00,793
{\an1}It hurts so much inside...
that I can't just leave it
alone, ya know?

98
00:10:02,362 --> 00:10:07,099
{\an1}Heh Although right now,
I'm in a ton of pain
everywhere, inside and out!

99
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:09,602
Naruto:
Ugh...

100
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:17,508
{\an1}Naruto... I knew you were always
alone back then.

101
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,610
{\an1}The village shunned you...

102
00:10:19,643 --> 00:10:24,913
{\an1}...just like they did with
me,... the lone Uchiha survivor.

103
00:10:25,348 --> 00:10:29,284
{\an1}You intentionally did stupid
things to get scolded...

104
00:10:29,786 --> 00:10:32,887
{\an1}...and to get people's
attention.

105
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,724
{\an1}In the beginning, I thought of
you as a good-for-nothing loser,

106
00:10:36,757 --> 00:10:40,160
{\an1}a weakling who just wanted to
goof around.

107
00:10:40,494 --> 00:10:45,332
{\an1}But the more I watched you being
idiotic and getting yelled at,
over and over...

108
00:10:45,365 --> 00:10:48,000
{\an1}it started weighing
on my mind.

109
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:54,038
{\an1}Back then... that's when I
wondered if your weakness was
beginning to rub off on me.

110
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,610
{\an1}Afterwards, every time I'd see
you, I'd think more and more
about you.

111
00:10:59,644 --> 00:11:03,180
{\an1}Seeing you desperately trying to
bond with others...

112
00:11:03,213 --> 00:11:05,915
{\an1}...made me remember my own
family.

113
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:10,252
{\an1}And I don't know why, but I
felt relief.

114
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:16,491
{\an1}Yet at the same time, I
considered it a weakness.

115
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:21,228
{\an1}I trained hard, as if to escape
that weakness...

116
00:11:21,261 --> 00:11:26,466
{\an1}...in order to get stronger than
my brother, in order to get my
revenge.

117
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:34,072
{\an1}Yet I ended up on the same team
as you and began thinking about
my family again.

118
00:11:34,106 --> 00:11:39,343
{\an1}Completing missions with you,
while you jabbered on and on
about becoming Hokage,

119
00:11:39,377 --> 00:11:42,813
I saw both of
us getting stronger... and...

120
00:11:42,847 --> 00:11:46,316
{\an1}...I started wanting to battle
you too, someday.

121
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:51,954
{\an1}And I began to see a shadow of
my own family in Squad 7...

122
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:56,391
{\an1}That's why every time I saw
you suffering...

123
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:59,893
{\an1}Yeah... that's right...

124
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:03,664
{\an1}...I, too, felt pain.

125
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:12,904
{\an1}When I understood your hurt, I
finally saw you as a comrade.
And conversely...

126
00:12:12,937 --> 00:12:20,378
{\an4}...I couldn't leave you alone.
You were getting stronger and
stronger. And watching you keep
getting stronger...

127
00:12:20,678 --> 00:12:22,614
I...

128
00:12:24,314 --> 00:12:25,649
Back then, I...

129
00:12:25,682 --> 00:12:27,885
{\an1}I always knew that you were
alone, too.

130
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:31,454
{\an1}all I really wanted to do was
come up to you and start
talking...

131
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:33,356
{\an1}I'd get sort of giddy.

132
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:36,358
{\an1}But I never did...

133
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:39,026
{\an1}'Cause I was jealous. You were
so good...

134
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,028
{\an1}...at everything!

135
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:44,331
{\an1}So I decided I'd make you my
rival!

136
00:12:44,365 --> 00:12:46,534
{\an1}And from that day on...

137
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,069
{\an1}...you've been my goal.

138
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,640
{\an1}At the beginning, I had nothing,
but I built bonds...

139
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:58,444
{\an1}I wanted to be strong like
you, cool like you.

140
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,846
{\an1}I guess that's why I kept
chasing after you.

141
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:06,116
{\an1}It was the opposite. I was the
one who was jealous of you.

142
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:10,085
{\an1}You had a strength that I
didn't have.

143
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:14,323
{\an1}You were always walking in front
of me.

144
00:13:14,356 --> 00:13:18,259
{\an1}Just like... my late brother.

145
00:13:21,596 --> 00:13:23,431
{\an1}And even today, too...

146
00:13:25,365 --> 00:13:27,267
{\an1}You'll have to take care of
Sasuke.

147
00:13:27,301 --> 00:13:28,435
Huh?

148
00:13:28,469 --> 00:13:30,437
{\an1}I was always gonna do that!

149
00:13:30,871 --> 00:13:34,340
{\an1}I was right to believe that you
could finish this.

150
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:39,211
{\an1}These are... Naruto's
memories!

151
00:13:39,244 --> 00:13:40,812
{\an1}And my future dream is...

152
00:13:40,846 --> 00:13:42,581
{\an1}...to be the greatest Hokage!

153
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:46,050
{\an1}Then the village will stop
disrespecting me and treat me
like I'm somebody!

154
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,685
{\an1}Somebody important!

155
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:51,020
{\an1}To be Hokage, you have to be the
greatest of all ninja.

156
00:13:51,054 --> 00:13:53,790
{\an1}You have to prove yourself, so
everyone believes in you.

157
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:57,059
{\an1}So you better make sure that
you're ready.

158
00:13:57,092 --> 00:14:00,229
{\an1}There is no easy way to becoming
Hokage!

159
00:14:00,995 --> 00:14:03,866
{\an1}Don't underestimate me! I
don't quit and I don't run!

160
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:05,299
{\an1}Well, all right!

161
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:09,069
{\an1}I don't care if I do get stuck
as a Genin for the rest of my
life...

162
00:14:09,102 --> 00:14:11,973
{\an1}...I'll still be Hokage
someday!

163
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:18,444
{\an1}And I don't go back on my
word. That's my nindo, my
ninja way.

164
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:22,380
{\an1}It's because, unlike you,
that's my goal.

165
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:25,717
{\an1}Just watch someday I'll be
Hokage!

166
00:14:27,685 --> 00:14:30,521
{\an1}... To be Hokage that is my
dream.

167
00:14:30,554 --> 00:14:34,591
{\an1}Till the day that I become
Hokage... Whatever happens...

168
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,927
{\an1}There's no way I'm gonna die!

169
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,496
{\an1}And I will become the greatest
Hokage of them all!

170
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:44,399
{\an1}That's my dream, and I won't
give up on it, you fool!

171
00:14:44,432 --> 00:14:51,104
{\an7}A Hokage is the one who walks
ahead of everyone else, enduring
their own pain. So that's why...

172
00:14:51,137 --> 00:14:55,041
{\an1}...a Hokage never walks over his
comrades' corpses.

173
00:14:55,074 --> 00:15:01,747
{\an1}There's no shortcut ú to
becoming Hokage! And no ways out
for the one who becomes Hokage!

174
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,583
{\an1}How could I ever be Hokage..?

175
00:15:04,616 --> 00:15:07,986
{\an1}If can't even save one
friend...

176
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:11,321
{\an1}Isn't that right... Sasuke?

177
00:15:30,872 --> 00:15:33,407
Naruto...

178
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,309
{\an1}Everything you've gone through
up till this moment...

179
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:43,883
{\an1}However powerful you are,
don't take it all on yourself.

180
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:47,819
{\an1}You do share your father's
dream, right?

181
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:49,955
{\an1}Then never forget...

182
00:15:49,988 --> 00:15:54,525
{\an1}Becoming Hokage isn't to get
acknowledged.

183
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:58,695
{\an1}Only those already acknowledged
become Hokage.

184
00:16:00,597 --> 00:16:03,265
{\an1}Never forget your friends!

185
00:16:05,968 --> 00:16:08,036
Big Brother...

186
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:09,838
Oww...

187
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:12,607
Heh

188
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,708
Huh?

189
00:17:55,192 --> 00:17:57,528
I see...

190
00:17:57,561 --> 00:17:59,229
All right...

191
00:17:59,263 --> 00:18:00,698
...show me...

192
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:06,469
{\an8}(Dripping)

193
00:18:10,106 --> 00:18:11,707
Where are we?

194
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,811
{\an1}Hold on... don't tell me it's
really Heaven this time...

195
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,847
{\an1}Seems we fell asleep and slept
the whole night through.

196
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,817
{\an1}We've failed to die yet again.

197
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:29,288
{\an1}Ugh, damn it! I still can't
move my body!

198
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:31,457
{\an1}I'd hoped to hit you again

199
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,660
{\an1}so I could make you finally
open up your eyes for real!

200
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:35,493
{\an1}(chuckling)

201
00:18:35,526 --> 00:18:36,894
{\an3}Huh?

202
00:18:36,928 --> 00:18:38,830
{\an1}Ha Ha Ha

203
00:18:38,863 --> 00:18:41,631
{\an1}What's so funny?!

204
00:18:41,665 --> 00:18:45,035
{\an1}We're all messed up, and you
still wanna fight?

205
00:18:45,068 --> 00:18:46,970
{\an1}Damn right! Whatever it
takes...

206
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:48,071
{\an1}I admit it.

207
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:48,838
{\an3}Huh?

208
00:18:50,806 --> 00:18:52,808
That I've...

209
00:18:54,977 --> 00:18:57,445
...I've lost.

210
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,182
Idiot!

211
00:19:02,616 --> 00:19:05,753
{\an7}Don't you get it?! This fight
isn't about winning or losing
at all!

212
00:19:05,786 --> 00:19:09,822
{\an7}It's actually about punching
a sulking friend, to make him
snap out of it!

213
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:13,658
{\an7}And the real match that I want,
comes after doing that!

214
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:15,494
{\an7}Hey, Naruto...

215
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:17,796
{\an8}What?!

216
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:19,197
You know...

217
00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:21,499
{\an1}...I just acknowledged you.

218
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:29,572
{\an1}If I die here, the long cycle
of destiny the Sage mentioned
might end.

219
00:19:29,606 --> 00:19:30,439
That's a...

220
00:19:30,472 --> 00:19:33,809
{\an1}...kind of revolution too.

221
00:19:33,842 --> 00:19:41,149
{\an4}Release the Infinite Tsukuyomi
once I'm dead by transplanting
my left eye into Kakashi or
someone else...

222
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:44,518
And I...

223
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:45,852
{\an1}...I will just...

224
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:49,990
{\an1}...put an end to myself.

225
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:53,559
{\an1}No way! You dying isn't gonna
settle things!

226
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:57,129
{\an1}If you're willing to die, then
live and help me instead.

227
00:19:57,163 --> 00:20:03,168
{\an1}What I want to do is get all
shinobi to cooperate. That
definitely includes you!

228
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:07,771
{\an1}Just because you want that
doesn't mean that others will.

229
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:12,375
{\an1}Damn it! Go ahead, keep
whining and sulking! I'll
hit ya again!

230
00:20:12,975 --> 00:20:16,411
{\an1}Also, ^ there's no guarantee I
won't oppose you.

231
00:20:16,444 --> 00:20:17,979
{\an1}Then I'll just stop you again!

232
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:21,183
{\an1}Besides, I know you won't do
that anymore.

233
00:20:22,783 --> 00:20:25,085
{\an1}How... can you be sure?

234
00:20:25,386 --> 00:20:28,621
{\an1}Huh! Look... don't make me
repeat myself!

235
00:20:31,891 --> 00:20:34,727
{\an1}Come on, are you seriously not
getting it yet?

236
00:20:35,327 --> 00:20:38,463
{\an1}Come to think of it... You
were always pretty dense...

237
00:20:45,303 --> 00:20:55,011
(Dripping)

238
00:22:43,635 --> 00:22:47,438
{\an1}"The Unison Sign"

239
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,509
{\an1}Just knock it off. ú Shut up,
you loser.

240
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:53,344
Heheheheh

241
00:22:58,281 --> 00:23:02,352
{\an1}Naruto... I'll now start
knowing your pain and
feelings, too.

242
00:23:02,385 --> 00:23:08,690
{\an1}You never cut me off. In fact,
you kept trying to get closer to
me.

243
00:23:08,723 --> 00:23:15,062
{\an1}You never stopping calling me
your friend. Even though I tried
to sever those feelings myself.

244
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:20,300
{\an1}Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Naruto Uzumaki!!"

245
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:24,036
{\an1}You stopped me,..
as a friend.
