Lady Tsunade inherited the
talents of the First Hokage.

84
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:11,979
{\an1}Are you saying that
talent is more important
than determination?

No! Not at all! But...

Mm-hmm! She's a Medical
Ninjutsu specialist.

93

Medical Ninjutsu is
ninjutsu that uses chakra
control for healing.

Transportation
Technique.

130
00:08:45,452 --> 00:08:47,789

{\an1}Hm.

139
00:09:12,372 --> 00:09:14,642

Nicely done,

00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:38,223
Oh...

147
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:40,694
So you don't
have a slug?

148
00:09:40,895 --> 00:09:41,663
Mmm...

149
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,102
{\an1}Don't you think a tortoise
is better than a slug?

150
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:46,639
{\an1}What's the matter,
little girl?

151

{\an1}Do you have something
against me?

152
00:09:49,178 --> 00:09:53,720
Oh. No. It's just that
you aren't legendary,
I guess.

153
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:57,328
{\an1}What insolence!
You'll sign no
contract with me, girl!

154
00:09:57,963 --> 00:09:58,564
Ah!

155
00:09:59,098 --> 00:09:59,900
Bleh!

{\an1}Don't be so
self-centered!

158
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,947
{\an4}It isn't very easy to
find a partner for a
summoning contract,
you know!

159
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:09,318
What? Are you serious?

160
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:12,391
{\an1}Anyway, for now,
just keep up with
your training!

161
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,128
Okay...

162
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,334
is there anything
else Lady Tsunade
is legendary for?

163
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:18,538
Mm?

164
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,540
Hmmm.

165
00:10:20,975 --> 00:10:24,248
{\an1}I suppose you could say
her love of sake and
gambling is legendary.

166
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:27,388
{\an1}But of course,
you can't emulate that!

167
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:32,331
{\an1}<i>I mean, you're still just</i>
<i>a little girl! It just</i>
<i>isn't proper! Ha ha ha!</i>

168
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:35,572
{\an1}<i>[Tente]</i>
<i>Gimme sake!</i>

169
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:38,243
You're too young
to be in here!

170
00:10:39,745 --> 00:10:40,113

171
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:43,588
{\an1}<i>[Tenten]</i>
<i>Hey! Stop it! Let me go!</i>

172
00:10:45,123 --> 00:10:45,658
Meow meow!

173
00:10:47,228 --> 00:10:50,300
{\an1}You'll see! I'm going to become
just like the legendary
kunoichi, Lady Tsunade!

174
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:55,477
{\an1}Like Lady Tsunade, huh?
Then you'll have to come
back when you're much bigger!

175
00:10:55,712 --> 00:10:59,519
{\an1}Lady Tsunade's big
chest is really what's
legendary about her!

176
00:11:00,954 --> 00:11:02,124
Legendary...

177
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:05,063
Big chest...

178
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:11,577
{\an1}This is it! Today is the
day I will beat you, Neji!

179
00:11:12,244 --> 00:11:12,945
Hmh.

180
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,087
Yaaaah!

181
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,191
[sigh]

182
00:11:19,392 --> 00:11:20,494
Huh?

183
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:22,632
Something troubling
your youthful
heart, Tenten?

184
00:11:25,738 --> 00:11:27,374
Daaagh!

185

learn, do you?

186

{\an1}Mm-hmm.

199

{\an1}Mmm.

Do not mind me!

298
00:20:21,974 --> 00:20:24,313
This is just a
rule that I have
made for myself.

299
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:28,888
{\an1}<i>When intensive training does</i>
<i>not work, I make myself do</i>
<i>ten thousand push-ups!</i>

300
00:20:28,921 --> 00:20:29,858
<i>Seventeen.</i>
<i>Eighteen.</i>

301
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,560
{\an1}And how long is
this gonna take?

302
00:20:32,195 --> 00:20:35,168
<i>Just ignore me.</i>
<i>Twenty-three.</i>
<i>Twenty-four.</i>

303
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:43,049
{\an4}Twenty-five. Twenty-six.
Twenty-seven. Twenty-eight.
Twenty-nine. Thirty. Thirty-one.
Thirty-two.

304
00:20:43,651 --> 00:20:46,490
{\an1}Dyaaaaagggh!

305
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:49,128
Glaagh!
Please! Tenten!

306
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,735
Heavy! So heavy!

307
00:20:52,602 --> 00:20:57,077
{\an1}Hey! Watch it! You're making
it sound like I'm the one
who's heavy here, Lee!

308
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,788
{\an1}What you should be saying is,
"The metal statue that you
brought is heavy, so heavy."

309
00:21:02,188 --> 00:21:03,291
So start saying it.

310
00:21:03,624 --> 00:21:05,930
{\an1}Eeeyaagh!

311
00:21:05,962 --> 00:21:07,900
You're really rude,
you know that?

312
00:21:11,741 --> 00:21:15,214
{\an7}<i>I don't want to be like Lady</i>
<i>Tsunade anymore. I've moved on.</i>

313
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,153
{\an7}<i>But I haven't given up my dream.</i>

314
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:23,196
{\an7}<i>I still want to become</i>
<i>a legendary kunoichi...</i>
<i>in my own right.</i>

315
00:22:57,351 --> 00:23:00,323
{\an4}<i>[Sai]</i>
<i>I was taking a walk to</i>
<i>see how things were</i>
<i>going in the village.</i>

316
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:03,497
{\an1}<i>Your argument reminds me</i>
<i>of Naruto and Sakura.</i>

317
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:05,868
{\an1}<i>Sakura's hit me like</i>
<i>that before, too.</i>

318
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,678
{\an1}<i>Huh? Well, they're more like</i>
<i>comrades than friends...</i>

319
00:23:11,513 --> 00:23:15,154
{\an1}<i>What's the difference between</i>
<i>a comrade and a friend? Hmm.</i>

320
00:23:16,523 --> 00:23:20,330
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>Sai's Day Off.</i>

321
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,836
{\an1}<i>That's a difficult question.</i>
