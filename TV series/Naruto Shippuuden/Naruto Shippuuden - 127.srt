00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,724
-I have two bells in my hand.

4
00:01:57,758 --> 00:02:00,124
And the fact that there
are only two means--

5
00:02:00,158 --> 00:02:02,391
-That one of us will lose.

6
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:04,558
-Very sharp, Orochimaru.

7
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,591
-Hey, if I get a bell then
you go out with me, Tsunade.

8
00:02:07,624 --> 00:02:11,558
-Fine, but when you lose don't
bother me anymore, all right?

9
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:12,258
-Yeah, all right!

10
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:12,858
Let's do this!

11
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:23,024
So many chances, here goes.

12
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:24,424
Ah.

13
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:24,924
Ah.

14
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:30,091
[laughing]

15
00:02:30,124 --> 00:02:32,158
-I told you, I won the bet.

16
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:33,158
So you get tied up.

17
00:02:33,191 --> 00:02:34,958
And you have to
stay away from me.

18
00:02:34,991 --> 00:02:38,124
-Oh, just shut up, stupid
flat-as-a-board Tsunade.

19
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,458
What did you just say to
me, you little brainy perv?

20
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:44,091
-Now, now, I'd
say, that's enough.

21
00:02:44,124 --> 00:02:47,391
Tsunade and Orochimaru may go.

22
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,591
-Bye.

23
00:02:48,624 --> 00:02:49,091
-Hmm.

24
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:55,558
-Uh, you're hopeless Jiraiya.

25
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:58,524
How can a ninja keep falling
into such obvious traps?

26
00:02:58,558 --> 00:03:00,224
-Can't help it.

27
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:03,424
-Perhaps you're simply lacking
a purpose to give you direction.

28
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,191
-Like what?

29
00:03:05,224 --> 00:03:07,858
-Let's see, what can we do?

30
00:03:07,891 --> 00:03:08,958
Yes, we can try that.

31
00:03:08,991 --> 00:03:10,024
That just may work.

32
00:03:10,058 --> 00:03:10,824
-What?

33
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:11,724
What is it?

34
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,758
-Don't get too excited.

35
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,424
Just watched this.

36
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:15,891
-Huh?

37
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:24,158
-Summoning Jutsu.

38
00:03:28,424 --> 00:03:30,258
-Whoa, cool!

39
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,191
-It's the Summoning Jutsu.

40
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,324
It's simple, really.

41
00:03:33,358 --> 00:03:35,691
You make a contract in
blood with an animal.

42
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:37,158
And then you can
summon that animal

43
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:40,191
at any given time using the
transportation technique.

44
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:43,191
I want to make a contract
with that one too, right now.

45
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,358
-Sorry, but that you can't do.

46
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,491
-Uh.

47
00:03:46,524 --> 00:03:48,424
-In the same way that
every man is destined

48
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,691
to a different fate,
so too is the animal

49
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:53,524
to whom he is entwined.

50
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:55,891
So what animal am
I entwined with?

51
00:03:55,924 --> 00:03:57,758
-Before you can
make such a contract

52
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,758
you need to become more adept
at infusing Chakra and making

53
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,858
signs.

54
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:02,658
-What?

55
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:03,558
Come on, are you kidding me?

56
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:04,758
More training?

57
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,824
-You will always find
the answer to any problem

58
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:08,724
within your training.

59
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:10,991
Jiraiya had found a purpose.

60
00:04:11,024 --> 00:04:15,458
And from that day on, he began
taking his training seriously.

61
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:17,624
However--

62
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,858
-Infuse more Chakra.

63
00:04:19,891 --> 00:04:22,291
Study up on making signs.

64
00:04:22,324 --> 00:04:26,558
[grunting]

65
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:29,391
-I must master the
transportation technique

66
00:04:29,424 --> 00:04:30,091
or else.

67
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:32,624
Oh, come on.

68
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:36,424
Will I ever be ready
to make a contract?

69
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:40,224
Why do I put myself through
all this rough training anyway?

70
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:42,558
-If I were to have
a boyfriend I'd

71
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:45,391
choose Orochimaru over
a brainy perv like you.

72
00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:50,091
The answer is simple.

73
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,858
I just have to become
the ultimate ninja.

74
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,591
And then I'll sweep
Tsunade off her feet.

75
00:04:54,624 --> 00:04:57,958
Now that I know what I need to
do, there's no time to waste!

76
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:03,258
-Well, look at that.

77
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:07,758
He's discovered his purpose
for becoming a ninja.

78
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,524
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
And not just Tsunade.

79
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:11,224
I'm going to get all
the pretty girls.

80
00:05:11,258 --> 00:05:13,958
Let's see,
concentrate my Chakra.

81
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:14,824
Make the seal.

82
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:17,258
Boar, dog, bird, monkey, sheep.

83
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:17,758
-No!

84
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:18,691
Wait!

85
00:05:18,724 --> 00:05:19,924
There's no telling
what will happen

86
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,724
if you use the transportation
technique without making

87
00:05:21,758 --> 00:05:22,858
a contract!

88
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:23,958
-And go!

89
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:33,224
[screaming]

00:05:38,124 --> 00:05:39,258

[groaning]

92
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:49,958
-Where am I?

93
00:05:54,924 --> 00:05:59,358
[hissing]

94
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:00,858
-Wait!

95
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:02,658
Hold it right there!

96
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:04,691
I, the great master,
Jiraiya, will fight.

97
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:17,158
Ha!

98
00:06:17,191 --> 00:06:19,158
Now, that's the way you do it.

99
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:19,891
-Hmm--

100
00:06:19,924 --> 00:06:20,624
-Uh--

101
00:06:20,658 --> 00:06:22,658
-It's a human child.

102
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:25,391
-Uh, are you seriously
a talking toad?

103
00:06:25,424 --> 00:06:27,991
-To think that a human
would come to Mount Myoboku,

104
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:29,658
I never thought I'd see it.

105
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:31,391
-Wait, what do you mean by that?

106
00:06:37,391 --> 00:06:42,224
-Master Fukasaku,
it's a human child.

107
00:06:42,258 --> 00:06:43,358
-So I see.

108
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:45,324
You have arrived at last.

109
00:06:45,358 --> 00:06:47,091
-You say that as though
you were expecting

110
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:49,024
me to show up all along.

111
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:51,624
-That's because we
knew you were coming.

112
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:55,624
The Great Elder predicted
this very happenstance.

113
00:06:55,658 --> 00:06:59,691
-One day, a human child will
stumble into Mount Myoboku.

114
00:06:59,724 --> 00:07:02,724
And I will give that child
the power of the toad

115
00:07:02,758 --> 00:07:03,658
as well as the prophecy.

116
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:08,558
And that is the very
essence of the dream

117
00:07:08,591 --> 00:07:10,758
which I have dreamt for myself.

118
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:14,858
My very own prophecy.

119
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:17,591
-But wait, if I'm
that human child, then

120
00:07:17,624 --> 00:07:21,691
what does the
prophecy say about me?

121
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:23,658
-Well, I'm afraid I don't know.

122
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:24,224
-What?

123
00:07:24,258 --> 00:07:26,358
You don't know?

124
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:29,324
-You must stay here
and train and wait

125
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:31,724
for the Great Lord
Elder's prophecy.

126
00:07:31,758 --> 00:07:32,858
-Wait, wait, hold on.

127
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:34,724
I made up my mind
to become strong

128
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:36,758
so that I'd be popular
with the girls,

129
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,991
not so I'll be
popular with frogs.

130
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:41,158
-There's no point
in complaining.

131
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:42,891
Your destiny's your destiny.

132
00:07:42,924 --> 00:07:45,324
And that is that.

133
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:47,791
-My destiny?

134
00:07:47,824 --> 00:07:52,324
-Yes, you did manage to come
to Mount Myoboku after all.

135
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:54,324
That is proof enough
that you are, indeed,

136
00:07:54,358 --> 00:07:57,391
the chosen one that the
Great Lord Elder spoke of.

137
00:07:57,424 --> 00:07:59,091
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
The chosen one, huh?

138
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:00,991
I like the sound of that.

139
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:03,324
Training here and
becoming strong,

140
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,358
that's pretty tempting too.

141
00:08:06,391 --> 00:08:08,558
FUKASAKU: From that
day forward, Jiraiya

142
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:12,758
divided his time between Mount
Myoboku, The Village of Toads,

143
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,691
and The Hidden Leaf Village.

144
00:08:14,724 --> 00:08:18,358
He spent the days of his youth
learning Ninjutsu and training

145
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:19,424
to become a sage.

146
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,991
However, it was
nowhere near as simple

147
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:42,624
as Jiraiya had thought it
would be when he first started.

148
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:29,091
-Without a doubt, I've gotten
stronger since coming here.

149
00:09:29,124 --> 00:09:33,391
But Tsunade is as cold as ever.

150
00:09:33,424 --> 00:09:34,724
Well, not just that.

151
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:36,824
If I was destined to
be the chosen one,

152
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:40,791
should my purpose be
merely to impress girls?

153
00:09:40,824 --> 00:09:42,591
Is that really the
only reason that I'm

154
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,491
trying to become strong?

155
00:09:44,524 --> 00:09:45,191
-Jiraiya!

156
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:46,958
Jiraiya!

157
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:48,324
-Yeah?

158
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:51,958
-The Great Lord Elder
has summoned you Jiraiya.

159
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:52,724
-What?

160
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:53,924
The Great Lord Elder did?

161
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,624
-Yes, you must hurry.

162
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:58,024
He has seen your
prophecy at last.

163
00:09:58,058 --> 00:09:58,724
-What?

164
00:09:58,758 --> 00:09:59,491
Are you serious Bunta?

165
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:03,791
You summoned me?

166
00:10:03,824 --> 00:10:05,424
-Well, how nice.

167
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,924
So you've finally come.

168
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,324
I'm glad.

169
00:10:10,358 --> 00:10:13,091
But uh, who are you again?

170
00:10:13,124 --> 00:10:14,591
Lord, this is Jiraiya.

171
00:10:14,624 --> 00:10:15,791
Jiraiya.

172
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,891
He's the human child.

173
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:20,958
-Oh yes, of course, I
remember it all now.

174
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:23,358
My, my, you sure have grown.

175
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:25,724
-You're the one who summoned
him here in the first place,

176
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,258
you great senile geezer.

177
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,658
-Ma, how dare you?

178
00:10:28,691 --> 00:10:31,758
You musn't refer to The Great
Lord Elder as a senile geezer!

179
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,658
Have some more
respect, would ya?

180
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:36,458
-Now, now, let's not fight.

181
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:39,124
Spouses must do their
best to get along.

182
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:46,391
Oh, and by the way,
um, who are you again?

183
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:51,591
-He's dreamt of you Jiraiya boy.

184
00:10:51,624 --> 00:10:55,424
And as you are no doubt aware,
his dream was not just a dream.

185
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:59,191
It was a prophecy of the future
which he will now tell you.

186
00:10:59,224 --> 00:11:01,258
So listen carefully.

187
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,624
-Yes sir.

188
00:11:02,658 --> 00:11:04,691
-I shall now tell you.

189
00:11:04,724 --> 00:11:06,724
I will relate my dream.

190
00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:10,858
You, who are singularly pervish
shall become a great ninja.

191
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:12,991
And once you do,
you shall acquire

192
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:15,958
an apprentice of your very own.

193
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:17,258
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Pervy?

194
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:21,258
Ugh, I can't believe he
remembers that, of all things.

195
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,291
-That apprentice
will become a ninja

196
00:11:23,324 --> 00:11:27,591
who will bring about a great
change in the ninja world.

197
00:11:27,624 --> 00:11:30,491
That is what I
foresaw in my dream.

198
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,158
-What kind of great change?

199
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,058
-Either great stability
or great destruction,

200
00:11:35,091 --> 00:11:37,991
the likes of which this
world has never seen,

201
00:11:38,024 --> 00:11:40,591
but which of these
two, I cannot say.

202
00:11:40,624 --> 00:11:42,224
-So it's either
one or the other.

203
00:11:42,258 --> 00:11:44,158
What does that mean exactly?

204
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:47,958
-You will be the one to guide
this revolutionary change.

205
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:50,024
And eventually there
will come a day

206
00:11:50,058 --> 00:11:53,391
when you will be forced to
make it critical selection.

207
00:11:53,424 --> 00:11:55,391
-To make a selection?

208
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,858
-Yes, and whatever
choice you end up making,

209
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:01,358
it will direct the way that this
great change is going to go.

210
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,858
-What must I do in order
to make the correct choice?

211
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:14,124
-In my dream I see you traveling
around the world writing books.

212
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:15,458
-Writing books?

213
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:16,624
But what for?

214
00:12:16,658 --> 00:12:18,391
-I do not know.

215
00:12:18,424 --> 00:12:21,291
But perhaps it means
you shall travel widely,

216
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:24,624
seeing all things
in this universe.

217
00:12:24,658 --> 00:12:27,224
-But Great Lord Elder,
have any of your prophecies

218
00:12:27,258 --> 00:12:28,658
ever not come to pass?

219
00:12:31,824 --> 00:12:32,724
-No, never.

220
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:48,953
-So you're going to start
traveling, is that right?

221
00:12:48,986 --> 00:12:49,986
-Yep.

222
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,553
At this point in my
life I just can't

223
00:12:51,586 --> 00:12:53,653
be a guide to a revolutionary.

224
00:12:53,686 --> 00:12:55,953
And I certainly don't know
how to make the right choice

225
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:57,519
in my prophecy.

226
00:12:57,553 --> 00:12:58,886
-Oh.

227
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,453
-I think what I need now is
time to see more of the world

228
00:13:01,486 --> 00:13:03,286
and meet different people.

229
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:04,986
-I see.

230
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:07,219
-So as foreseen in The
Great Lord Elder's dream,

231
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:08,819
I'll journey
throughout the world

232
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:12,153
and maybe write a book too.

233
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:13,586
It seems that that's my destiny.

234
00:13:16,286 --> 00:13:18,353
FUKASAKU: While Jiraiya
journeyed and searched

235
00:13:18,386 --> 00:13:21,486
for the meaning behind The
Great Lord Elder's dream,

236
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,953
the state of the world
grew steadily more chaotic.

237
00:13:24,986 --> 00:13:28,386
The peace that existed
between the five great nations

238
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:29,853
grew fragile.

239
00:13:29,886 --> 00:13:33,253
Aggression between the
lands escalated greatly.

240
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:36,253
And within land's
borders, internal strife

241
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:37,819
increased as well.

242
00:13:37,853 --> 00:13:41,086
And everywhere people began
to suffer great hardships.

243
00:13:47,753 --> 00:13:51,053
-Young man, may I ask
why you're traveling?

244
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:53,386
-I'm searching for my destiny.

245
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:55,086
-Oh really?

246
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:59,019
-I journey from land to land,
as I was foretold in a dream.

247
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:00,919
[baby crying]

248
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:03,253
-Oh my, what's wrong?

249
00:14:03,286 --> 00:14:06,119
[baby crying]

250
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:07,619
-Here, have one.

251
00:14:07,653 --> 00:14:08,486
It's milk candy.

252
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:17,219
It's just a puppet.

253
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:19,086
-This child tells me
destiny is in something

254
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:21,186
that you search for.

255
00:14:21,219 --> 00:14:25,519
Destiny is something you
latch onto when it appears.

256
00:14:25,553 --> 00:14:27,653
An age of war is coming.

257
00:14:27,686 --> 00:14:31,453
My mechanical skills are
useless in times of peace.

258
00:14:31,486 --> 00:14:34,253
But some Lord may pay a
high price for my services

259
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:36,286
in battle.

260
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:38,086
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
So he's a Shinobi too.

261
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:42,719
And he's chosen to ride the wave
toward the age of destruction.

262
00:14:42,753 --> 00:14:46,119
That will only hasten it.

263
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,953
-Come on, let's
do something fun.

264
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:50,119
Please?

265
00:14:50,153 --> 00:14:51,053
-Mm.

266
00:14:51,086 --> 00:14:53,019
-What's that you're
writing anyway?

267
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:54,953
-Just scribblings for now.

268
00:14:54,986 --> 00:14:58,219
Basically, it says that writing
on the wave of the times

269
00:14:58,253 --> 00:15:00,319
can never bring about
the revolutionary change

270
00:15:00,353 --> 00:15:02,119
that we need to achieve peace.

271
00:15:02,153 --> 00:15:06,119
-You know, if you really want
to change something, change me.

272
00:15:06,153 --> 00:15:08,286
-Mm, I suppose you're right.

273
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:10,519
That does sound
like a lot more fun.

274
00:15:10,553 --> 00:15:12,919
-This is fraud!

275
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:16,319
You think I'm going to pay
for something like this?

276
00:15:16,353 --> 00:15:19,253
-Hold it right there.

277
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,553
I'll take over now.

278
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,519
If you want to fight, fight me!

279
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:28,919
-Dammit, how can
fate be so cruel?

280
00:15:28,953 --> 00:15:31,453
I've worked hard to better my
land with what little knowledge

281
00:15:31,486 --> 00:15:33,786
I have, all for the
sake of my clan.

282
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:34,753
And yet--

283
00:15:34,786 --> 00:15:35,953
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
So this guy's

284
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:38,819
dissatisfied with the way
the world is going too.

285
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:41,019
Here pal, have a drink on me.

286
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:43,819
You know, I've been
searching for my destiny too.

287
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:45,519
But it's been proving
quite elusive.

288
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:48,819
-Huh, it's useless
to search for that.

289
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:50,853
My people simply
don't stand a chance

290
00:15:50,886 --> 00:15:54,086
against the Shinobi villages
of the great nations.

291
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,619
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Ugh,
is that all this guy can do,

292
00:15:56,653 --> 00:15:57,686
complain?

293
00:15:57,719 --> 00:15:58,886
-You're wrong, you know.

294
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:00,453
-Hmm?

295
00:16:00,486 --> 00:16:02,353
-I am a teacher in a village.

296
00:16:02,386 --> 00:16:04,786
And what I do there is
show the children just

297
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:07,853
how they can fight back when
they find themselves facing

298
00:16:07,886 --> 00:16:09,286
a harsh fate.

299
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:12,786
So what, education
can stop a war?

300
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:14,586
Enough of your useless lecture.

301
00:16:18,219 --> 00:16:19,886
Is he a Shinobi too?

302
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:20,686
-No.

303
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:21,953
It can't stop a war.

304
00:16:21,986 --> 00:16:24,586
But perhaps at the least
I can teach the children

305
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:27,786
new skills that will enable
them to make better choices.

306
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:32,186
-Let me ask you, just what
are those choices then?

307
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:33,519
-Life or death, of course.

308
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:35,253
Those are the choices.

309
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,619
The only lesson that I'm
truly capable of teaching them

310
00:16:37,653 --> 00:16:39,353
is how to survive.

311
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:40,753
-Hmm.

312
00:16:40,786 --> 00:16:43,553
(VOICEOVER) That's
not good enough.

313
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,986
I must find the
revolutionary who

314
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:47,853
can bring peace
to the world, then

315
00:16:47,886 --> 00:16:49,786
make the choice that
will get in there.

316
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:55,719
-Huh?

317
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:05,819
-To bring destruction on this
world or to bring about a peace

318
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:08,519
unlike any we've
known, it all depends

319
00:17:08,553 --> 00:17:11,586
on the commitment
of each person.

320
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:14,686
-Hmm, could he be the one?

321
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:16,519
Hey, you up there.

322
00:17:16,553 --> 00:17:18,853
You just might be the person
I've been looking for.

323
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:20,353
-Oh really?

324
00:17:20,386 --> 00:17:23,519
-Tell me, how would you
bring peace to this world?

325
00:17:23,553 --> 00:17:26,186
-This world is careening
toward an age of war, strife

326
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:27,219
and sadness.

327
00:17:27,253 --> 00:17:28,953
And nothing can stop it.

328
00:17:28,986 --> 00:17:31,619
-You just said, it depends
on people's commitment.

329
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:34,853
So how do we go about changing
these people's destinies then?

330
00:17:38,586 --> 00:17:40,553
-All we can do is
pray and have faith.

331
00:17:40,586 --> 00:17:44,186
That's all any man can do
in a world like this one.

332
00:17:44,219 --> 00:17:46,519
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Hmm,
this man isn't the one either.

333
00:17:57,219 --> 00:17:58,186
-What's that?

334
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:03,719
Bah!

335
00:18:03,753 --> 00:18:06,319
If this was just an
ordinary village why would

336
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:07,619
a Shinobi do this?

337
00:18:26,753 --> 00:18:29,686
[breathing heavily]

338
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:32,686
That Shooter Kinjutsu, you're
from the Fuma, aren't you?

339
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:35,586
Why are you attacking
villagers living in peace?

340
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:37,553
-You're a Shinobi too.

341
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:41,086
-I'm journeying in search of one
who will become my apprentice.

342
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,619
-Ha, why waste time on
something so tedious?

343
00:18:44,653 --> 00:18:46,953
The balance of power between
the lands is teetering.

344
00:18:46,986 --> 00:18:50,253
And we're standing on
the verge of a great war.

345
00:18:50,286 --> 00:18:52,319
That village was
destroyed because of a tip

346
00:18:52,353 --> 00:18:54,886
that Shinobi had infiltrated it.

347
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:57,386
-All that because of a mere tip?

348
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,686
-It's destroy or be destroyed.

349
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:01,953
In this world you
hesitate and you die.

350
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:05,486
-Huh?

351
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:09,653
Smoke bomb.

352
00:19:12,553 --> 00:19:15,919
[grunting]

353
00:19:15,953 --> 00:19:19,086
-You're pretty
good, you know that?

354
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,586
-If you're a Shinobi too
than I cannot let you live.

355
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,419
Look, just give up now.

356
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:27,153
This is our fate,
the fate of Shinobi.

357
00:19:27,186 --> 00:19:29,553
-Can I-- say something?

358
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:30,953
-I don't want to hear it.

359
00:19:30,986 --> 00:19:34,319
Just die!

360
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:38,786
-Give up, huh?

361
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:39,719
Yeah, about that--

362
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:51,386
-Even if you do take me
down, another assassin

363
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:53,319
will attack the village.

364
00:19:53,353 --> 00:19:56,253
As long as we're cursed to live
in this world of the Shinobi

365
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:57,686
there can be no peace.

366
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:02,953
-The Great Lord
Elder's prophecy said

367
00:20:02,986 --> 00:20:05,186
that I'm destined to train
the Revolutionary who

368
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:08,553
could at last bring peace
to this troubled world.

369
00:20:08,586 --> 00:20:11,153
But in all my travels,
I haven't even

370
00:20:11,186 --> 00:20:12,853
come close to finding
this apprentice.

371
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:18,453
FUKASAKU: Even at
that early stage,

372
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:22,019
battles were inevitably being
fought between the lands.

373
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:25,819
Jiraiya was forced to put his
journeys on hold and return

374
00:20:25,853 --> 00:20:27,986
to the Hidden Leaf
Village to do his part

375
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,486
alongside the other Shinobi.

376
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:47,486
-Tsunade, we are at war.

377
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:54,686
-Orochimaru-- to erase
this sadness from the world

378
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:57,719
of the Shinobi I must find
the revolutionary from

379
00:20:57,753 --> 00:20:59,019
the prophecy.

380
00:20:59,053 --> 00:21:04,186
I must choose the one who
could bring peace to all of us.

381
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:07,886
FUKASAKU: The flames of war
that have consumed so many

382
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,486
throughout history finally drew
in Jiraiya and his comrades.

383
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,919
The conflict that they
entered would one day

384
00:21:14,953 --> 00:21:18,286
be called the Third
Great Ninja War.

385
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,253
And afterward, thanks
to their exploits,

386
00:21:21,286 --> 00:21:23,019
Jiraiya and his
compatriots would

387
00:21:23,053 --> 00:21:25,519
come to be known as
the legendary Sannin.

388
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,410
[theme music]

389
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:05,672
JIRAIYA: Boy, it sure
isn't easy coming up

390
00:23:05,706 --> 00:23:07,439
with ideas for writing a book.

391
00:23:07,472 --> 00:23:09,506
The hero of this one
has seen too much

392
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:11,972
of the world of the
Shinobi, where fighting only

393
00:23:12,006 --> 00:23:13,039
breeds more fighting.

394
00:23:13,072 --> 00:23:15,306
It's a world filled with hate.

395
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:18,606
I want him, somehow, to wipe
away the hate and create peace.

396
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:21,239
And yet, it's so hard
to think about how

397
00:23:21,272 --> 00:23:23,272
to build up the
story to its climax.

398
00:23:23,306 --> 00:23:25,406
What am I going to do?

399
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:27,906
Next time, Tales
of a Gutsy Ninja,

400
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:31,272
Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls, Part Two.
