145
00:15:53,873 --> 00:15:57,774
{\an8}<i>Ahh! Damn it!</i>
<i>I'm being pulled</i>
<i>backwards!</i>

146
00:15:57,807 --> 00:16:02,109
{\an1}Lord Madara! You must
take them in order!
One Tail first!

147
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:04,142
{\an1}Well aware
of that...

148
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:08,810
{\an4}<i>(White Zetsu)</i>
<i>But since the Tailed Beasts that</i>
<i>you're dragging out of the</i>
<i>Jinchuriki are the final two,</i>

149
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:14,212
{\an1}Why don't you just go ahead
and pull in One Tail through
Seven Tails in the meantime?

150
00:16:14,245 --> 00:16:18,479
{\an1}No you bastard! I'm
not letting you take
Kurama from me!

151
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:23,114
{\an7}You're right. Looks
like this'll take
longer than I expected.

152
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:26,948
{\an8}So then, let's
start with them!

153
00:16:28,349 --> 00:16:30,249
<i>Desert Hands!</i>

154
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,549
You can't have
Shukaku!

155
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:48,388
{\an7}<i>(Shukaku Flashback)</i>
<i>Once you fall asleep, I'm going</i>
<i>take over your body and soul</i>

156
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:52,955
{\an8}<i>...and then I'll</i>
<i>slaughter all of</i>
<i>you humans!</i>

157
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:57,822
{\an7}So... you'd better
not doze off!

158
00:16:58,323 --> 00:17:01,790
{\an1}You mean, you
hate human beings?

159
00:17:01,823 --> 00:17:04,424
Yeah! I despise them!

160
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:09,625
{\an1}But you... I thought
you exist to protect
my village, don't you?

161
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:13,093
{\an1}I've never protected you all
because I wanted to!

162
00:17:13,127 --> 00:17:18,461
{\an1}You humans are lesser
than us beasts!

163
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,930
Here's your
meal, Shukaku!

164
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:37,533
{\an4}I don't get it. Why do we have
to stand guard over a weird old
monk even though we're senior
shinobi?

165
00:17:38,034 --> 00:17:41,268
{\an1}I know what you mean, but being
assigned Jinchuriki watch duty

166
00:17:41,302 --> 00:17:44,101
{\an1}is n acknowledgment of your
strength and your skills.

167
00:17:44,135 --> 00:17:46,169
{\an1}Stop griping and deal with it.

168
00:17:47,535 --> 00:17:48,970
{\an8}<i>(Shukaku)</i>
<i>Hey, you damn monk. </i>

169
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:53,704
{\an8}<i>They </i>
<i>don't even call you by </i>
<i>your real name anymore!</i>

170
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:56,672
{\an1}I don't really mind
about all that...

171
00:17:56,705 --> 00:18:01,773
{\an1}<i>Since you know my</i>
<i>true name, that's</i>
<i>what matters.</i>

172
00:18:01,806 --> 00:18:07,207
{\an7}You may be a monk, but,
come on! Don't you ever
get lonely or anything?

173
00:18:07,241 --> 00:18:12,310
{\an7}Putting up with humans who
hate you, and a beast like me?

174
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:15,209
{\an7}Caged up like this with
a man-hating beast that's

175
00:18:15,243 --> 00:18:19,010
{\an7}been with you ever since
the day you were born!?

176
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:24,313
Well, remember that I'd
die the moment that I'm
separated from you...

177
00:18:24,346 --> 00:18:27,380
since I'm a Jinchuriki.

178
00:18:27,414 --> 00:18:32,847
{\an1}Besides, there's really no
need to distinguish between
man and beast.

179
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:38,816
{\an1}Because a friend of the heart
provides peace of mind no matter
what their species.

180
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:42,183
{\an7}I gotta say, you are one
strange bastard.

181
00:18:42,216 --> 00:18:46,885
{\an7}I bet there isn't ever going to
be another human like you again.

182
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:51,386
<i>(Bunpuku)</i>
<i>No... I think</i>
<i>you're wrong there.</i>

183
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,054
{\an1}Human souls are like
reflecting water.

184
00:18:55,087 --> 00:19:00,322
{\an1}People often speak or act
the opposite of their true
feelings.

185
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:04,356
{\an1}But I believe that
fundamentally...

186
00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:08,489
{\an1}people's hearts wish to connect
with and accept each other.

187
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:12,124
{\an1}<i>...Even with Beasts.</i>

188
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:21,994
{\an7}You know, you kinda remind
me of old man Sage of Six Paths.

189
00:19:29,063 --> 00:19:32,730
{\an7}Thank you, very much.

190
00:19:32,763 --> 00:19:39,564
{\an7}I believe that those are the
most heart warming words that
I've ever recieved from you.

191
00:19:39,898 --> 00:19:44,300
{\an1}[knock] Hey! Just hurry up and
eat, old man! We've got other
things to do!

192
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:50,667
{\an7}Heh! Seriously, though, I really
can't see there being other
people like you out there.

193
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:53,868
Oh, I'm sure
there are.

194
00:19:54,135 --> 00:20:00,737
{\an1}<i>I know that one day someone will</i>
<i>emerge who will protect, redeem,</i>
<i>and shepard you.</i>

195
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:07,739
{\an1}And the moment you come to
accept his true heart, you
too will likely comprehend

196
00:20:07,772 --> 00:20:13,341
{\an1}the meaning of these
words that my mentor
etched onto my palms.

197
00:20:13,673 --> 00:20:15,375
["LOVE"]

198
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:23,410
{\an1}Gaara! Don't
lose, you hear!?

199
00:20:28,178 --> 00:20:32,611
{\an1}I've always considered
you unpleasant.

200
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:37,013
{\an1}But because I was a
Jinchuriki I got to
meet Naruto.

201
00:20:37,046 --> 00:20:41,114
{\an1}So at least that's one
thing I'm grateful to
you for.

202
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:49,482
{\an1}Why you little sand brat!
Are you seriously that happy
to have your old pet back?!

203
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:53,551
{\an1}How dare you interfere,
when you won't even die
as a Jinchuriki?!

204
00:20:56,517 --> 00:20:58,419
[gasp]

205
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:07,254
{\an1}you know my motto is "absolute
defense!" I've still got my
pride as Shikaku!

206
00:21:08,088 --> 00:21:09,922
Yes, I know...

207
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:15,090
You're wrong. You
know nothing at
all, you fool.

208
00:21:20,057 --> 00:21:22,591
[grunt]

209
00:22:57,683 --> 00:23:02,584
{\an8}<i>(Madara)</i>
<i>People desire peace. And yet</i>
<i>on the other hand, they crave</i>
<i>conflict as well.</i>

210
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:06,852
{\an8}<i>(Madara)</i>
<i>That's right. Hashirama's </i>
<i>nation building bore a paradox.</i>

211
