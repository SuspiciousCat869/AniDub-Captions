1
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:13,772
That's...

2
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:17,076
[gasp]
But he's-!

3
00:00:17,743 --> 00:00:19,046
Madara!

4
00:00:20,614 --> 00:00:26,020
{\an1}So, you've defied the
Reanimation Jutsu. That is
so like you.

5
00:00:26,054 --> 00:00:29,491
{\an1}More importantly, what's
taking you so long?

6
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:33,830
{\an1}But why? Why is that Madara
over here right now?!

7
00:00:34,664 --> 00:00:35,698
Madara?!

8
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:37,101
That Madara?!

9
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:45,644
{\an1}This one is a Shadow Clone
as well. Where's the
original, Obito?

10
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:52,286
{\an1}Hey, Naruto! With him here,
that must mean...

11
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,123
{\an1}What's happened to everyone
over there?!

12
00:00:57,358 --> 00:00:58,927
My brother!

13
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:00,963
{\an1}He's over there?

14
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:05,435
{\an1}I asked you what happened!

15
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,405
Not sure.

16
00:01:08,105 --> 00:01:09,140
But I bet...

17
00:01:13,678 --> 00:01:17,116
{\an1}...that none of them
are doing too well.

18
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:09,086
[groaning]

19
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:19,733
Summoning Jutsu!

20
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,605
Lady Tsunade!

21
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:26,907
Katsuyu...

22
00:03:27,643 --> 00:03:28,909
A favor please.

23
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:31,146
{\an1}Yes, ma'am! I'll reattach
you right away!

24
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:32,682
No, don't!

25
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:35,618
{\an1}My lower body can
wait a bit longer.

26
00:03:36,986 --> 00:03:38,289
But first...

27
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:42,860
{\an1}Bring the other Kage to me...

28
00:03:44,029 --> 00:03:48,301
{\an1}I know that I can
still save them.

29
00:03:52,938 --> 00:03:55,409
{\an1}Faster than the Curse Mark
Chains can wrap around.

30
00:03:57,844 --> 00:04:00,649
{\an1}I'll return that.
Since it's yours.

31
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:01,650
{\an1}[harrumphing chuckle]

32
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:19,037
{\an1}I can finally move!
Thanks, Naruto!

33
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:22,041
{\an1}Now, it's my turn!

34
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:24,378
[angry roaring]

35
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:33,121
{\an4}Obito, you launched that
plan half-baked before you
could even take the Eight
and Nine Tails in?

36
00:04:33,154 --> 00:04:34,557
[gasp]

37
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,327
{\an7}<i>He knows Obito's plan...</i>

38
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:39,429
{\an7}<i>What's their relationship?</i>

39
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:46,338
{\an4}You were too hasty, Obito.
And is that also the reason
why I was revived in this
form?

40
00:04:52,412 --> 00:04:57,017
{\an1}Well, then again, knowing
you... I'm sure that you must
have something in mind.

41
00:04:57,051 --> 00:05:01,123
{\an1}What have you been up to
till now? Where is Nagato?

42
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:06,596
{\an1}You were supposed to find
the right moment and bring
me back with Rinne Rebirth.

43
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:08,398
{\an1}That was the agreement.

44
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:14,839
{\an1}I'll use Gedo Art of
Rinne Rebirth.

45
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:22,214
{\an4}Nagato's visual prowess
itself is the jutsu that
presides over life and death.
He is the seventh Pain.

46
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:26,119
{\an1}Oh, yeah? You were
trying to use Nagato?!

47
00:05:26,487 --> 00:05:28,356
{\an1}He betrayed us both.

48
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:30,491
He revived the
Leaf villagers.

49
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:32,494
{\an1}Can't depend on any of you.

50
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:35,832
{\an1}But never mind. It's
still not too late.

51
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:39,936
{\an1}I'll capture the Eight and
Nine Tails now!

52
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:44,275
{\an1}Dead men shouldn't go around
screwing things up!

53
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:46,278
[attacking yell]

54
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,858
{\an7}Huh?! No explosion?!

55
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:02,230
{\an1}Uchiha Reflection!

56
00:06:19,618 --> 00:06:24,290
{\an1}I'll get the Eight and Nine
Tails. Obito, you take down
those two.

57
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:30,699
Obito... What
happened to you?!

58
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:32,902
{\an1}Why'd you join him?!

59
00:06:43,547 --> 00:06:47,485
Am I... Am I dead?

60
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:52,859
[gasp]

61
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:56,931
Where am I ?

62
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:02,604
{\an1}Between this life and the
next, my young Uchiha.

63
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:06,208
Those eyes!

64
00:07:06,943 --> 00:07:10,280
{\an1}No way, Gramps! You're
an Uchiha, too?!

65
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:13,584
{\an1}Well, perhaps I am.

66
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:17,389
{\an1}He rescued me? But wait...

67
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,092
{\an1}You said "between this life
and the next."

68
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,463
{\an1}Where exactly is that? It's
dark, I can't see.

69
00:07:24,898 --> 00:07:27,534
{\an1}And besides, Gramps, who in
the world are you?

70
00:07:28,268 --> 00:07:31,104
{\an1}[chuckle] Don't tell me
you're actually Death
himself!

71
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,510
{\an1}You know, the guy
who escorts people to
heaven or to hell...

72
00:07:39,114 --> 00:07:40,483
No!

73
00:07:41,117 --> 00:07:44,722
{\an1}I don't want to die yet!
Somebody, help!

74
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:51,196
{\an4}I just saw a scythe! I knew
it! I was right! You're Death
for sure! The Grim Reaper for
the Uchiha Clan!

75
00:07:51,798 --> 00:07:56,102
{\an1}Wait! I lived my life by a
creed of helping elderly
people in need!

76
00:07:56,369 --> 00:08:00,008
{\an4}Sure, I caused a lot of
mischief and broke rules all
the time, but I'm certain
the balance on

77
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,410
{\an1}my scale tips to the
positive side!

78
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:05,047
{\an1}Please! Not hell!
[groaning]

79
00:08:06,348 --> 00:08:11,755
{\an1}The simple fact that you are
able to feel such pain means
that you are still alive.

80
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:16,894
{\an1}However, that you survived
could be called miraculous.

81
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:20,733
{\an1}It's incredible those
boulders did not crush you.

82
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:25,005
{\an1}It's almost as if you passed
right through them.

83
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,475
{\an1}So where did you find me?

84
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:35,118
{\an4}Inside of an underground
passageway that I had
created, collapsed next to
some crumbled rock.

85
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:42,826
{\an4}Still, half your body had
been mostly crushed. I
patched you up as best as I
could, but...

86
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:45,729
{\an1}Are you saying that you
saved me, Gramps?

87
00:08:45,964 --> 00:08:48,033
{\an1}[chuckle] Well, thank you.

88
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:50,903
{\an1}It's too early to
thank me just yet.

89
00:08:50,936 --> 00:08:55,341
{\an1}And besides, I still intend
to have you repay your debt
to me.

90
00:08:55,374 --> 00:08:59,546
{\an1}After all, helping the
elderly is your motto,
isn't it?

91
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:02,183
{\an1}Oh, well, yeah, I
guess so, but...

92
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,554
{\an1}What do you want me to do?

93
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:08,657
Help you with
bathroom stuff?

94
00:09:08,691 --> 00:09:10,259
{\an1}That would be good.

95
00:09:11,728 --> 00:09:14,397
{\an1}Well, I'm sorry, but I can't
stay here forever!

96
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:19,104
{\an1}Now that I know I'm alive, I
gotta get home to the Leaf
Village!

97
00:09:20,338 --> 00:09:24,444
{\an1}There's a war going on. My
Sharingan has finally
awakened...

98
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:27,246
{\an1}So I can protect my
comrades better now!

99
00:09:29,717 --> 00:09:31,986
Protect your
comrades better?

100
00:09:32,754 --> 00:09:33,788
What's wrong?

101
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:38,861
{\an1}I'm afraid with the body you
have now, your life as a
shinobi is over.

102
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:39,930
[gasp]

103
00:09:39,963 --> 00:09:44,135
{\an1}No, no, no! But I- But I
finally just got this eye!

104
00:09:44,468 --> 00:09:46,003
{\an1}And I'm confident!

105
00:09:46,037 --> 00:09:49,407
{\an1}My combination attacks will
be even better now!

106
00:09:55,048 --> 00:09:55,982
Thought so.

107
00:09:57,617 --> 00:10:00,588
{\an1}Even his smell is gone.
We'll have to locate him by
the slightest hint of sound.

108
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:05,894
{\an1}Okay! Where is he?!

109
00:10:09,165 --> 00:10:10,500
{\an1}Obito, behind you!

110
00:10:15,572 --> 00:10:16,373
Kakashi!

111
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:21,947
{\an1}Kakashi, hey! Are
you all right?!

112
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:32,860
{\an4}Even if they are just kids,
it can't hurt to be
cautious. I'm gonna take
this nice and slow.

113
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:36,198
{\an1}That guy, he's good.

114
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:40,236
{\an1}He got rid of the knife
stained with my blood so I
couldn't smell it.

115
00:10:43,174 --> 00:10:49,614
{\an4}Got some of that dust in
your eyes again? A Shinobi
shouldn't cry. I'm not dead
yet.

116
00:10:53,451 --> 00:10:56,722
{\an1}If that were now... I wouldn't
have let it happen...

117
00:11:02,797 --> 00:11:03,498
Die!

118
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:12,576
{\an1}But how?! There's no way
that you could've seen me!

119
00:11:13,076 --> 00:11:15,012
{\an1}Obito ! How did-?!

120
00:11:22,921 --> 00:11:26,593
{\an1}[gasp] Those eyes!
What are-?

121
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,530
{\an1}This time, I will
protect my comrade!

122
00:11:44,214 --> 00:11:46,416
You're certainly
stubborn, aren't ya?

123
00:11:53,424 --> 00:11:56,062
{\an1}Pathetic. Can't even
handle two kids.

124
00:12:00,634 --> 00:12:06,074
{\an4}Rin's Chakra has been
disturbed. It's flowing in
patterns different from
yours and mine.

125
00:12:06,108 --> 00:12:11,080
{\an4}She's probably under a
Genjutsu. They didn't want
to waste time getting
information out of her.

126
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:14,118
{\an1}We fought earlier. He's
quick. So be careful.

127
00:12:15,052 --> 00:12:15,719
Gotcha!

128
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:52,197
{\an8}<i>And...</i>

129
00:12:53,765 --> 00:12:56,002
{\an7}<i>At last I'll be a shinobi</i>
<i>who can protect his</i>
<i>comrades.</i>

130
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:07,615
{\an1}Wake up to reality.

131
00:13:08,016 --> 00:13:11,220
{\an1}Nothing ever goes as planned
in this accursed world.

132
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:18,429
{\an4}The longer you live, the
more you'll realize that
the only things that
truly exist in this reality

133
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:22,101
are merely pain,
suffering, and futility.

134
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:24,436
{\an7}<i>What's up with this old man?</i>

135
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:25,671
Listen...

136
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:32,113
{\an4}Everywhere you look in this
world, wherever there is
light, there are always be
shadows to be found as well.

137
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:38,153
{\an1}As long as there is a
concept of victors, the
vanquished will also exist.

138
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,693
{\an1}The selfish intent of
wanting to preserve peace
initiates wars.

139
00:13:43,726 --> 00:13:46,997
{\an1}And hatred is born in
order to protect love.

140
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:51,970
{\an1}These are nexuses, causal
relationships that cannot be
separated.

141
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,705
Normally....

142
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:59,612
{\an7}<i>Great, he's started a</i>
<i>lecture! Old people go on</i>
<i>forever once they start. </i>

143
00:13:59,645 --> 00:14:01,848
So, where are we
now, anyway?

144
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:07,622
{\an1}In exchange for you getting
injured, another or others
were saved.

145
00:14:07,655 --> 00:14:09,224
Isn't that so?

146
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:13,797
This is bad!

147
00:14:14,164 --> 00:14:14,898
{\an1}Run for the exit!

148
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:24,876
Kakashi!

149
00:14:27,814 --> 00:14:28,381
[grunt]

150
00:14:49,107 --> 00:14:53,112
{\an1}You guys all right?
Rin? Kakashi?

151
00:14:53,145 --> 00:14:54,146
Huh?

152
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:55,582
Obito!

153
00:15:04,258 --> 00:15:07,661
No, don't. It's
okay, Kakashi.

154
00:15:08,497 --> 00:15:12,301
{\an1}I don't - I don't think I'm
gonna make it.

155
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:19,243
{\an1}My right side is completely
crushed. I can't even feel
anything there anymore.

156
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:23,348
No!

157
00:15:26,684 --> 00:15:31,758
{\an1}I'm... giving you my...
Sharingan.

158
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:33,260
[gasp]

159
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:39,468
{\an1}Whatever the village or
anyone else may say...

160
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:42,704
{\an1}I think that you're
a great Jonin.

161
00:15:42,738 --> 00:15:46,209
{\an1}It's true. That's how I
really feel.

162
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,013
{\an1}Please accept this...

163
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:00,760
{\an1}Kakashi, take care of Rin.

164
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,101
{\an1}Rin, take my hand now!

165
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:09,070
Rin!

166
00:16:22,186 --> 00:16:23,154
Obito!

167
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:31,599
{\an1}Just when Kakashi and I were
starting to get along...

168
00:16:33,099 --> 00:16:37,439
{\an1}...And I never got to
tell Rin that I love her.

169
00:16:38,306 --> 00:16:43,145
{\an1}I just wish that I could've
spent more time with
everyone.

170
00:16:50,254 --> 00:16:55,793
{\an4}Look, just shut up already!
I can't stay in here with
you for too long, old man! I
gotta get-!

171
00:16:55,827 --> 00:16:57,563
[grunt]

172
00:16:57,863 --> 00:17:01,601
{\an1}Fine, then. You may leave
if you really want to.

173
00:17:01,635 --> 00:17:04,505
{\an1}If you're even able
to move, that is.

174
00:17:04,739 --> 00:17:08,543
{\an1}[heavy breathing]

175
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:12,615
{\an7}<i>Wait a second... There's</i>
<i>something weird about this.</i>

176
00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:15,985
{\an1}What's a geezer with
Sharingan doing here
all by himself?

177
00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:21,925
{\an1}Come to think of it, I know
all geezers and grannies in
the Hidden Leaf Village,

178
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,929
{\an1}and yet I've never seen
him around before...

179
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:32,539
{\an1}So this guy currently isn't
a Leaf Shinobi. Which means...

180
00:17:34,141 --> 00:17:36,611
{\an1}Hey, Gramps... I bet...

181
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,281
{\an1}...you're a Rogue Ninja aren't
you? Who are you?!

182
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:54,599
{\an1}I am merely an Uchiha ghost.

183
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:58,403
{\an1}I'm Madara Uchiha.

184
00:18:00,073 --> 00:18:01,374
M- Madara?!

185
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:04,378
By Madara...

186
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:07,482
{\an1}You mean Madara Uchiha,
my ancestor?!

187
00:18:08,048 --> 00:18:12,987
{\an1}But Madara's supposed to
have died ages ago! What era
are we talking about?!

188
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:17,927
{\an4}Let me get this straight.
You're more likely to
believe that I'm the Grim
Reaper, is that what

189
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,062
you're saying?

190
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:25,069
{\an1}Well, I guess that I just
might be Death, in a sense...

191
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:30,275
For truly, this
reality, is a hell.

192
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,313
{\an1}I am a cheater of death.

193
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:38,052
{\an1}Who would without a doubt be
dead in no time at all if I
were not continuously

194
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:41,556
{\an1}siphoning chakra from that
Gedo Statue behind me...

195
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:51,902
I'm going home!

196
00:18:56,474 --> 00:18:57,442
Do not bother.

197
00:18:58,176 --> 00:19:00,513
There are no
exits from here.

198
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,753
{\an1}And in any event, neither
you nor I are able to leave
this place right now.

199
00:19:06,587 --> 00:19:09,190
Not with these
bodies, at least.

200
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:18,134
{\an4}Move and the synthetic
Hashirama tissue I took the
trouble of attaching will
peel off.

201
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:20,336
{\an1}Do you wish to die?

202
00:19:22,206 --> 00:19:26,845
{\an4}There are a lot of things
that I would like you to do
for me, for the rest of our
lives.

203
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,018
{\an1}I went to great pains to
save you. Do not rush to
your death.

204
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:38,560
{\an4}Just what do you want?! What
does a crazy geezer like you
even want from a brat like
me, anyway?!

205
00:19:39,427 --> 00:19:42,698
{\an1}I want to sever the
fate of this world.

206
00:19:45,134 --> 00:19:52,309
{\an1}A world of only victors...
A world of only peace...
A world of only love.

207
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:56,648
{\an1}I will create such a world.

208
00:19:57,081 --> 00:19:58,917
{\an1}So what! Who cares!

209
00:19:59,251 --> 00:20:00,787
I just want...

210
00:20:01,153 --> 00:20:03,990
{\an1}I just want to go back
home to everyone!

211
00:20:04,023 --> 00:20:09,096
{\an1}And as I told you, things in
this world simply do not go
as planned.

212
00:20:09,965 --> 00:20:13,134
{\an1}In time, you'll come to
realize that is truth.

213
00:20:17,473 --> 00:20:20,544
{\an1}If you really want to die so
badly, then go ahead.

214
00:20:20,878 --> 00:20:24,147
{\an1}But I shall be taking
that Sharingan of yours.

215
00:20:26,484 --> 00:20:27,853
{\an1}But why do you want my eye?!

216
00:20:28,921 --> 00:20:31,156
{\an1}You already have a
Sharingan of your own!

217
00:20:31,423 --> 00:20:32,692
Actually...

218
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:37,297
{\an1}My original eyes are
currently on loan to another
person.

219
00:20:37,698 --> 00:20:40,735
{\an1}This one is just a spare
that I transplanted later.

220
00:20:40,768 --> 00:20:44,773
{\an1}And I'd like to have a few
more to keep in stock...

221
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:49,112
I do not have a
right eye yet.

222
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:54,552
{\an1}And only with two together
can the Sharingan's true
power be unleashed.

223
00:20:55,452 --> 00:21:00,325
{\an7}<i>Then that means if I team up</i>
<i>with Kakashi, we'll both be</i>
<i>even stronger!</i>

224
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:03,663
{\an7}<i>And we'll be able to protect</i>
<i>Rin properly, together!</i>

225
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:07,902
<i>I definitely</i>
<i>can't stay here.</i>

226
00:21:09,303 --> 00:21:13,207
<i>Just you wait...</i>
<i>Kakashi... Rin!</i>

227
00:21:15,044 --> 00:21:15,811
<i>I...</i>

228
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:18,748
<i>...I'm alive!</i>

229
00:22:57,301 --> 00:23:02,175
{\an1}<i>I was outside just now! Your</i>
<i>friends Rin and Stupid</i>
<i>Kakashi are in trouble!</i>

230
00:23:02,207 --> 00:23:03,810
<i>What's going on?</i>

231
00:23:03,843 --> 00:23:06,747
{\an1}<i>They're alone and completely</i>
<i>surrounded by Hidden Mist</i>
<i>Shinobi!</i>

232
00:23:07,547 --> 00:23:10,417
{\an1}<i>Kakashi! You made me a</i>
<i>promise! </i>

233
00:23:10,451 --> 00:23:12,487
{\an1}<i>Please, protect Rin!</i>

234
00:23:13,555 --> 00:23:14,756
{\an1}<i>I'll be right there!</i>

235
00:23:15,457 --> 00:23:19,129
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "I'm in Hell."</i>

236
00:23:19,863 --> 00:23:25,103
{\an1}<i>Kakashi and I will</i>
<i>protect Rin together!</i>
