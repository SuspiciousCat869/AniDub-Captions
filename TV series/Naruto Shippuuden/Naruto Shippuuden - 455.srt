145
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:10,436
{\an1}I would like to use
words first before
employing any violence.

146
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,570
{\an1}So I will come up
with a strategy.

147
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,671
{\an1}Despite what Lord Third
said, he'll do whatever it
takes...

148
00:11:16,705 --> 00:11:19,006
{\an1}<i>...to protect the Hidden</i>
<i>Leaf. </i>

149
00:11:19,573 --> 00:11:21,274
{\an1}You must choose.

150
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:25,076
{\an1}<i>Align with the Uchiha and</i>
<i>launch the coup d'eat,</i>

151
00:11:25,109 --> 00:11:27,576
{\an1}<i>and be slaughtered</i>
<i>along with your family...</i>

152
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:32,112
{\an1}<i>...or side with the Leaf,</i>
<i>and before they attempt the</i>
<i>coup, eliminate every Uchiha</i>

153
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:34,080
{\an1}<i>except your younger brother.</i>

154
00:11:34,113 --> 00:11:35,914
{\an1}<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>Eliminate the Uchiha?!</i>

155
00:11:35,947 --> 00:11:41,415
{\an1}<i>To protect the Leaf, every</i>
<i>possible step must be taken</i>
<i>to avoid mayhem. </i>

156
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:45,318
{\an1}<i>The only one that can handle</i>
<i>this mission is you, a</i>
<i>double agent for both the</i>

157
00:11:45,352 --> 00:11:47,819
{\an1}<i>for both the Uchiha</i>
<i>and the Leaf.</i>

158
00:11:48,385 --> 00:11:53,355
{\an1}There's no one else, Itachi.
So, will you accept this
mission or not?

161
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,527
{\an1}<i>The Village or the Clan?</i>

162
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:14,197
{\an1}<i>What should I do?</i>

00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,434
{\an1}Yeah, of course
I did, you loser.

166

{\an1}If I were serious, I
would've beaten you, Sasuke!

<i>Hey. </i>

171
00:12:56,714 --> 00:12:59,482

them in order to make sure a

{\an1}What do you want now?

{\an1}Well, you've become a
Rogue Ninja listed in
the Bingo Book, Captain,

00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:03,545
{\an1}an S-Class, no less.

235

case you turned on me.

246
00:18:46,797 --> 00:18:52,000
{\an1}You mean that... you
distrusted us right from
the very beginning?

247
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:54,268
I was acting as
a double agent.

248
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:58,369
{\an1}I see through the
eyes of both the Leaf
and the Uchiha.

249
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:02,904
{\an1}But to be honest, I don't
know whose spy I really
was...

250
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:11,941
{\an1}Within the organization,
I'm known as Tobi. I'm
not an official member.

251
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:16,776
{\an1}I'm a newbie within the
Akatsuki who doesn't
possess any spectacular

252
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:20,611
{\an1}jutsu. You should treat me
as if that's true.

253
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:23,080
{\an1}Why hide your identity?

254
00:19:23,113 --> 00:19:29,450
{\an1}<i>If people knew Madara Uchiha</i>
<i>was still alive, things</i>
<i>would become complicated.</i>

255
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:33,784
{\an1}<i>Only the Akatsuki leader,</i>
<i>who we're meeting, knows the</i>

{\an1}Oh, that's right! You're
from the same hometown!

260
00:19:46,523 --> 00:19:48,723
{\an1}So is this going to
be a touching reunion?!

261
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:50,991
Ah, the rumors
were true.

262
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:54,759
{\an1}I always knew you
were a shinobi like
the rest of us.

263
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,060
{\an1}Like the rest of us?

<i>the village, the clan, and</i>

{\an1}<i>The goal of the Akatsuki...</i>

Nations, the Akatsuki shall

That's quite a
lofty goal.

their history.

welcome you into the
Akatsuki.

{\an1}From here on,
reject the leaf.

274
