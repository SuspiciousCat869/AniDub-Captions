need to visualize.

{\an1}To visualize with grilled
chicken?!

reading books and
learning to visualize,
too. See ya!

visualization?! And tell
me. What kind of training
is that, Sensei?!

00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:24,157
{\an4}Oh, well without any

training! I guess...

118
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:29,424

{\an5}Perhaps if we try it out
this very day, right now,
then we shall remember what
happened yesterday!

Please, let us try!

122
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:42,362
{\an4}If I train and remember,
it will be like killing
two birds with one stone!
And if you remember, too,

123
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:45,063
{\an1}it is like killing
three birds with one
stone!

what you were telling
me about!

00:09:33,846 --> 00:09:34,814
{\an3}Yep!

132
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:38,981
{\an1}You see, those delicious

is definitely a crane!

135
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,653

with the crane, then
you're close to mastering
the White Crane Fist!

{\an1}Huh! Now that you
mention it...

{\an1}It is quite difficult to
balance on one leg in the

00:10:18,794 --> 00:10:20,995
{\an1}The "Grilled chicken"
technique!

145
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:26,298
{\an1}I see! Visualize grilled
chicken! Very deep!

146
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,364
{\an1}All right! I will become
grilled chicken!

147
00:10:29,398 --> 00:10:33,133
{\an1}Yes! Great! Visualize it!

148
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,067
Huh?

149
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:39,534
{\an1}But for some reason, the
birds appear to be
getting very upset.

150
00:10:39,568 --> 00:10:42,468
{\an1}[gulping]
I think that
you're right.

<i>Nice bird! Oh,</i>
<i>no, no!</i>

153
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:56,340
{\an4}I guess eating a bird in
front of other birds
wasn't such a good
idea.

154
00:10:56,373 --> 00:10:58,875
{\an1}But there won't be any
problems this time!

{\an1}<i>Oh! Barbecued eel! </i>

156
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,877
{\an1}Is there really an eel
technique, Sensei?

157
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:10,579
{\an4}You're not visualizing
hard enough, Lee! An eel
moves just like a snake,
right?

158
00:11:10,612 --> 00:11:12,213
{\an1}And that means...

159
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:15,848
{\an1}<i>Snake Fist! </i>

160
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:18,114
Right! The Snake Fist!

Yes, sir!

164
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:28,252
{\an1}Visualize a snake
slithering silently and
hunting its prey...

165
00:11:28,285 --> 00:11:29,952
{\an1}Ahhh!

166
00:11:29,985 --> 00:11:32,786
{\an1}Sensei! What is this?!

167
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:36,454
Oh, it's just a little
something they call
quicksand!

168
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,721
[screaming]

170
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:53,260
{\an8}Whoa. That was a very
close call!

171
00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:56,627
{\an1}Not quite. Problems are
just chances to succeed!

172
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,495
{\an8}Right! But why are we
climbing this mountain,
anyway, Sensei?

173
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:03,430
{\an1}'Cause next on the menu
is Ma Po tofu.

00:12:03,463 --> 00:12:05,097
<i>Okay, but...</i>

175
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,865
{\an1}It contains hawk claw
chili pepper.

176
00:12:07,898 --> 00:12:10,365
{\an1}Hawk claw should
remind us of...

{\an1}Eagle Claw Fist!

{\an1}Nothing ventured, nothing
gained! To visualize an
eagle, find its nest!

Let's be friends!

184
00:12:28,671 --> 00:12:30,006
{\an1}Hurry up, Lee!

185
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:34,506
{\an1}Sensei, is the essence of
Eagle Claw Fist here?

186
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,541
[gasping]

[screaming]

00:12:38,574 --> 00:12:40,742
Now, that's the essence
of Eagle Claw Fist!

189
00:12:40,775 --> 00:12:43,676
{\an1}I agree!

190
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:52,980
{\an1}Sensei, have you
remembered anything
yet?

191
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:55,914
{\an1}Uh, no. What about
you, Lee?

00:12:55,947 --> 00:12:57,481
{\an1}<i>Not really.</i>

00:12:57,514 --> 00:12:59,115
Oh! I see!

194
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:03,984
{\an7}<i>Good! This visualization</i>

{\an1}[gulping]
Aaahhh!

00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:11,286

00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:12,987

{\an7}<i>I must stop him from</i>

202
00:13:33,294 --> 00:13:36,761
{\an1}Sensei, just one final
menu item was circled.

203
00:13:36,794 --> 00:13:41,529
{\an5}Let's hope we remember
after this, Or we'll
just have to forget
the entire thing!

204
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:43,297
So, what did
you circle?

205
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:48,199
{\an4}Well, I sure hope that this
works. The last item we
circled at dinner is a
bottle of sake!

206
00:13:48,232 --> 00:13:49,199
[spitting]

207
00:13:49,232 --> 00:13:51,033
{\an1}That must mean a
technique like the Dr--

208
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:52,900
Drifter Fist!!

209
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:53,567
{\an1}What?

210
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,567
It's the Drifter Fist!!

211
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,202
{\an1}Ah! The ocean!

212
00:13:58,068 --> 00:14:00,669
{\an1}There is a technique that
is called the Drifter
Fist?

213
00:14:00,702 --> 00:14:02,304
Yes, of course!

214
00:14:04,271 --> 00:14:09,705
{\an4}<i>That was close! I have to</i>
<i>avoid bringing up any</i>
<i>images of alcohol. Drunken</i>
<i>Fist is out of the question.</i>

215
00:14:09,739 --> 00:14:12,307
{\an1}<i>Let us start training</i>
<i>right now! </i>

216
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,641
{\an1}Lee, what in the world
are you doing?

217
00:14:14,674 --> 00:14:20,709
{\an4}Well, to learn the
Drifter Fist, I thought
that we would do our
training on a boat.

218
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:24,443
{\an1}Oh! Of course! You really
are becoming quite sharp!

219
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:27,811
{\an1}The visualization
training is paying off
in spades.

220
00:14:32,713 --> 00:14:35,681
{\an7}<i>Oh, boy. It had</i>
<i>to be a boat.</i>

221
00:14:35,714 --> 00:14:37,748
{\an1}<i>Let us begin, Sensei. </i>

222
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:41,250
This training involves
more than just simple
visualization.

223
00:14:41,284 --> 00:14:46,751
{\an5}There's no point in even
starting unless you can
maintain balance on a boat
that's swaying on the water.

224
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:51,287
{\an4}Yes, Guy Sensei! But if
this is all the swaying,
then it should be quite
easy.

225
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,687
Stop! Stop! Just stop!

226
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,554
{\an5}To remain still on the
water's surface! That is
the essence of Drifter
Fist.

227
00:14:58,588 --> 00:15:01,390
{\an1}Hey, don't do that! Don't
rock the boat so much!

228
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:04,791
{\an1}Whoaaa-- but Sensei,
I'm not doing this!

229
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,993
{\an1}Ahhhhh!

230
00:15:13,027 --> 00:15:16,662
{\an1}This training is
definitely intense!

232
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:21,863

[groaning]

234
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:32,633
{\an1}Oh no! Those moves look
just like the Drunken
Fist! I have to stop him!

[gagging]

236
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:38,102
{\an1}Listen, Lee! You can't
master the Drifter Fist
with moves like those.

237
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:40,136
{\an1}You must stand firm!

{\an1}[groaning]

239
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,737

{\an1}[groaning]

241
00:15:46,638 --> 00:15:48,939
{\an1}I am standing firm.

00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:52,640
Hold on... What kind of
movement is that?!

243
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:55,908
{\an1}I am sorry, but to keep
my balance...

244
00:15:55,942 --> 00:15:58,108
{\an1}... This works best.

245
00:15:58,142 --> 00:16:03,677
{\an7}<i>That boy...! The Drunken</i>
<i>Fist just comes naturally</i>
<i>to him. That's right! </i>

{\an1}What's the big idea?!

260
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:50,592
{\an7}So that's what
happened... It was you
all along...

261
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:52,860
{\an1}<i>Guy Sensei, I am sorry. </i>

262
00:16:52,894 --> 00:16:56,461
{\an7}Why are you apologizing?
[gagging]

263
00:16:56,494 --> 00:17:00,430
{\an1}I believe that I did
something terrible
yesterday!

264
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:04,664
{\an4}And you were forced to
fall to your knees to
apologize for my shameful
deed!

265
00:17:04,698 --> 00:17:05,531
Uh!

266
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,300
So, then... You remember
everything that happened?

267
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:14,168
{\an7}I do not remember the
event itself.

268
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:19,803
{\an7}But what I do remember is
the shop being in ruins
and you apologizing to
the owner.

269
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:25,038
{\an7}I see... And when you saw
that, you must have found
me pathetic, indeed...

270
00:17:25,072 --> 00:17:28,672
{\an7}Not so! Because the
words that you spoke
then were so...

271
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:32,506
{\an1}This day was to celebrate
my pupil's efforts.

272
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,308
{\an1}I admit he's foolish and
only knows how to work
hard.

273
00:17:36,342 --> 00:17:41,910
{\an4}But still, he strives
harder than any other
man, and he will succeed
because he's a genius at

274
00:17:41,943 --> 00:17:43,610
{\an1}working hard!

275
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:48,546
{\an4}He's a great shinobi, the
future of the Leaf, the
treasure I've dedicated
my life to!

276
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:53,214
If anyone's to blame,
it's me as his master!
Forgive me!

277
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:57,315
{\an1}And after that... you
asked them not to spoil
my big day!

278
00:17:57,349 --> 00:18:00,817
{\an1}Which was to mark my
past successes and my
future endeavors.

279
00:18:02,017 --> 00:18:07,485
{\an4}That is all that I'm able
to remember... But the
fervor in your words
struck me!

280
00:18:07,518 --> 00:18:11,619
{\an7}That is why I have been
trying so hard to get you
to remember what happened!

281
00:18:11,653 --> 00:18:14,388
{\an7}So you could scold me
for all of my mistakes!

282
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:20,190
{\an7}But this is the final
hint, my last chance to
unlock all those hidden
memories...

283
00:18:20,223 --> 00:18:22,191
{\an1}So now...

00:18:22,224 --> 00:18:24,091
{\an1}What do I do...?!

00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,493
{\an1}Sensei?!

288
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,494
Hear me! You have done
nothing wrong!

289
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:36,862
All you did was try to
learn the Drunken Fist
technique!

290
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:40,663
{\an1}Sensei! You regained
your memory?

291
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:45,332
Never mind that. I'm
going to teach you the
art of the Drunken Fist!

292
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:49,899
{\an1}But, you need to drink
sake to learn it, do you
not, Sensei?

293
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:53,800
You're stronger the
drunker you get! That is
Drunken Fist!

294
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:57,502
But you already have an
innate affinity for that
technique!

295
00:18:57,535 --> 00:19:04,071
{\an4}Just embrace your nausea!
Through seasickness,
perfect your own, unique
Drunken Fist!

296
00:19:04,105 --> 00:19:05,504
{\an1}What, really?!

297
00:19:05,537 --> 00:19:08,272
And then put this
training to use!

298
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:10,107
<i>Let's go! </i>

299
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,173
{\an1}<i>Right! </i>

300
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,177
{\an1}Hyyyaaah!

301
00:19:24,611 --> 00:19:25,379
{\an1}[yelling]

302
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:27,979
[grunting]

303
00:19:29,246 --> 00:19:31,813
{\an1}[yelling]

304
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,849
{\an1}Too easy, Lee! Severe
Leaf Hurricanes!

305
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:39,683
[gagging]

306
00:19:39,716 --> 00:19:43,084
{\an1}All right, then! Leaf
Whirlwind!

307
00:19:43,485 --> 00:19:47,452
{\an1}This nausea is getting
worse by the second!

308
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:51,587
But your Seasick Fist is
looking better and
better!

309
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,653
[gagging]

310
00:19:53,988 --> 00:19:58,056
{\an1}Yes! This is my own
version of the Drunken
Fist! The Seasick Fist.

311
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:00,656
Yes! The Seasick Fist!

312
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,691
{\an1}Here I come!

313
00:20:02,891 --> 00:20:03,891
He's gone?!

314
00:20:05,493 --> 00:20:08,126
{\an1}I really feel sick!

315
00:20:10,327 --> 00:20:14,862
{\an1}Ahhhhhh!

316
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:20,597
{\an7}Guy Sensei! Guy Sensei!
Are you all right, Guy
Sensei?!

317
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,032
[chuckling]
You sure got me good.

318
00:20:24,065 --> 00:20:27,466
You did it! The Seasick
Fist.

319
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:30,401
{\an1}That was a terrific hit!

320
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,502
{\an1}Guy Sensei... That means
the world to me!

321
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:39,070
[retching]

322
00:20:43,304 --> 00:20:48,040
{\an7}And as a result of
undergoing intense
training through
seasickness, Lee finally

323
00:20:48,073 --> 00:20:50,940
{\an7}managed to perfect his
Seasick Fist!

324
00:20:50,974 --> 00:20:52,274
<i>He can't use it,</i>
<i>though... </i>

325
00:20:53,941 --> 00:20:58,443
Huh? Well, surely unless
he overcomes his seasickness,
he can't use it in battle.

326
00:20:58,476 --> 00:20:59,943
And then Lee said...

327
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,912
{\an4}Through hard work and
guts, I swear to conquer
my seasickness and master
the Seasick Fist!

328
00:21:06,945 --> 00:21:08,414
{\an1}<i>That's not what I meant. </i>

329
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:10,213
{\an1}Huh?

330
00:21:10,247 --> 00:21:14,149
{\an4}I mean there's really no
way that he can fight
while he's seasick, but
unless he feels woozy

331
00:21:14,182 --> 00:21:15,615
{\an1}from the seasickness...

332
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:18,083
{\an1}Then it really won't be
like the Drunken Fist,
will it?

333
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:20,217
Eh-heh.

334
00:21:20,251 --> 00:21:22,885
{\an1}Come on!

335
00:22:55,782 --> 00:22:59,517
{\an1}What?! Our food's
infested with mushrooms!

336
00:22:59,551 --> 00:23:02,518
{\an1}It's not just the food.
Our water is gone, too.

337
00:23:02,552 --> 00:23:04,985
{\an1}We have to turn the ship
around right now!

338
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:08,287
{\an1}<i>We can't. Once we're</i>
<i>on this route, turning</i>
<i>back is impossible. </i>

339
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,021
{\an1}<i>But-! </i>

340
00:23:10,054 --> 00:23:13,621
{\an4}<i>We can't change course</i>
<i>for two weeks. We'll have</i>
<i>to do without food or</i>
<i>water till then! </i>

341
00:23:14,522 --> 00:23:19,657
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: Eat or Die!</i>
<i>Mushrooms from Hell! </i>

342
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,258
{\an1}<i>I need food! Give me</i>
<i>something to eat! </i>
