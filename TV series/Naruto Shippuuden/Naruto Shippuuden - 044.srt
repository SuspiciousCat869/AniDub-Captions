1
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:11,657
-Mm.

2
00:00:11,657 --> 00:00:14,764
You don't know the first thing
about good manners, do you?

3
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:53,076
When addressing someone
of superior rank,

4
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:55,615
proper etiquette dictates
you face them directly.

5
00:01:42,745 --> 00:01:48,724
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): His body
is-- It's covered with wounds.

6
00:01:48,757 --> 00:01:51,730
[screaming]

7
00:02:22,794 --> 00:02:23,829
-It's finally over.

8
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:33,716
-Naruto!

9
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,286
Naruto!

10
00:02:35,286 --> 00:02:37,424
[theme music]

11
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:44,318
-Well, then.

12
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,022
Speak up.

13
00:04:46,055 --> 00:04:50,363
-The truth of the matter
is, my master, Lord Danzo,

14
00:04:50,398 --> 00:04:53,838
has longed to meet you, Lord
Orochimaru, ever since the time

15
00:04:53,871 --> 00:04:55,073
you nearly destroyed the Leaf.

16
00:05:51,356 --> 00:05:55,497
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): These
wounds are slow to heal.

17
00:05:55,497 --> 00:05:57,903
Naruto's always recovered
quickly up 'til now,

18
00:05:57,903 --> 00:06:01,777
thanks to the Nine
Tail's chakra.

19
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:06,520
JIRAIYA: When Naruto is cloaked
in the chakra of the Nine

20
00:06:06,554 --> 00:06:11,364
Tails, I know it looks
like he's being protected,

21
00:06:11,364 --> 00:06:14,537
but the truth this, his
body is continuously

22
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:17,877
being harmed by
that same chakra.

23
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,716
When the fourth tail
emerged, his whole body

24
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,654
suffered severe injuries.

25
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:26,028
He ran amok, covered in blood.

26
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:32,541
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): The fourth
tail Master Jiraiya spoke of.

27
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,812
I never imagines it would
be as powerful as this.

28
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:07,947
-Captain Yamato.

29
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,717
-Yeah?

30
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:13,158
-That jutsu you used
to pacify Naruto.

31
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:15,964
Could you-- Could you
please teach it to me?

32
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:20,472
-That is impossible.

33
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:30,160
Only I can perform
that jutsu because I

34
00:07:30,193 --> 00:07:33,599
carry the First
Hokage's DNA within me.

35
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,003
-Oh.

36
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:39,646
-That jutsu has the ability
to suppress the Nine Tail's

37
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:41,483
chakra.

38
00:07:41,516 --> 00:07:44,856
Without special powers
like those I inherited,

39
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:48,564
it is impossible for
anyone to perform it.

40
00:07:48,597 --> 00:07:51,470
Yet all I am is an experiment.

41
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:54,175
My powers pale in
comparison to the original.

42
00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:00,889
That necklace hanging
around Naruto's neck

43
00:08:00,922 --> 00:08:04,763
is something that used to
belong to the First Hokage.

44
00:08:04,763 --> 00:08:07,904
It's a chakra crystal that
responds to his chakra alone.

45
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:18,125
The Jinchuriki can be controlled
through that necklace.

46
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:21,933
It's said the First qualified
to be Hokage partly because

47
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:24,704
of that power.

48
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:26,174
And it's also the
reason that I was

49
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,845
chosen to be your commander.

50
00:08:42,207 --> 00:08:43,711
-It's always like this.

51
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:54,232
The only things I can
ever do for Naruto

52
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:56,070
are the little things
anyone could do.

53
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:06,825
-It doesn't matter whether
the things you do for him

54
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:07,994
are great or small.

55
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:14,707
What matters most is
how much you care,

56
00:09:14,707 --> 00:09:15,844
really care, about Naruto.

57
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:26,832
I can tell, just by watching
you, Sakura, just how

58
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,038
much you--

59
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:31,275
NARUTO: Sakura.

60
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:31,877
I--

61
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:44,602
-Naruto!

62
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:48,610
-What the-- What just happened?

63
00:09:48,644 --> 00:09:50,081
Why am I here?

64
00:09:50,114 --> 00:09:54,055
I remember going after
Orochimaru, and then--

65
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:59,233
and then-- What did
I do after that?

66
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,736
What happened, Sakura?

67
00:10:03,608 --> 00:10:05,112
Sakura, what's wrong?

68
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:07,784
Are you crying?

69
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:09,855
-No, just got something
in my eye, that's all.

70
00:10:09,888 --> 00:10:12,627
-I know, it was Sai, wasn't it?

71
00:10:12,627 --> 00:10:15,767
I swear, if that snake said
something hurtful to you like,

72
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,072
you're ugly, or you've
got monster strength!

73
00:10:20,944 --> 00:10:22,046
That little jerk.

74
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,982
I'll--

75
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:24,251
-No.

76
00:10:24,284 --> 00:10:28,092
No, Sai didn't say anything
about monster strength.

77
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:28,794
-Really?

78
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,428
He didn't?

79
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,066
-No, but I think you just did.

80
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:33,904
So who's the jerk?

81
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:42,756
Speaking of which-- Captain
Yamato, Where is Sai?

82
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,676
-And that is the message
Danzo wanted me to convey.

83
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:56,952
-I find that very interesting.

84
00:11:41,843 --> 00:11:45,117
It's a very intriguing story.

85
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:48,257
But give me one good reason
why I should believe you.

86
00:12:09,768 --> 00:12:11,438
What do you think you're doing?

87
00:12:11,438 --> 00:12:13,476
Let's not be hasty, Kabuto.

88
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:15,246
Calm down.

89
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,956
I believe our ranks may
have just increased by one.

90
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:24,097
-You don't actually think
that we can trust this one?

91
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:26,903
-The contents of that
envelope might convince you.

92
00:12:29,442 --> 00:12:30,244
Open it.

93
00:12:30,277 --> 00:12:32,181
It's from Lord Danzo to you.

94
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:06,384
-Why, this is--

95
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:07,820
-What does it say?

96
00:13:12,931 --> 00:13:17,240
-Kabuto, let the child go.

97
00:13:17,273 --> 00:13:19,445
We're going to be
taking him with us.

98
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:31,202
Shall we be leaving, Sai?

99
00:13:31,235 --> 00:13:32,572
That's your name, isn't it?

100
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:45,933
-As we feared.

101
00:13:51,276 --> 00:13:54,249
-Well, Captain Yamato?

102
00:13:54,283 --> 00:13:57,990
-Sai has-- hang
on just a moment.

103
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:04,444
-Huh?

104
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:11,251
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): The bridge.

105
00:14:17,497 --> 00:14:20,036
-I planted it on him back when
we were at the hot springs,

106
00:14:20,036 --> 00:14:21,906
just in case we needed it.

107
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,481
I suppose it won't hurt to
tell him in person, as well.

108
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:28,420
I may not look like it, but
tracking is my specialty.

109
00:14:38,106 --> 00:14:40,144
-Captain Yamato?

110
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:40,912
-Oh, right.

111
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:42,148
Where is Sai?

112
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:46,156
Well, actually, he's
gone off with Orochimaru.

113
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:48,628
They're together.

114
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:50,598
-Wha--

115
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:54,073
-They're together?

116
00:14:54,073 --> 00:14:56,477
Wait, what are you saying?

117
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,279
-Let's go.

118
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:58,482
You two follow me.

119
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,610
-The ground is still soft.

120
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:29,245
The way this whole place is all
torn up, and with the bridge

121
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:31,482
being totally wrecked?

122
00:15:31,516 --> 00:15:33,654
Will somebody tell me
what happened here?

123
00:15:36,593 --> 00:15:37,729
-You don't remember anything?

124
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,215
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): Again.

125
00:15:47,248 --> 00:15:50,388
It's all just as
Master Jiraiya said.

126
00:15:50,422 --> 00:15:53,395
JIRAIYA: His anger
acts like a trigger.

127
00:15:53,428 --> 00:15:57,203
The number of tails increases
along with his rage.

128
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:59,407
He was able to
maintain consciousness

129
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,680
through the appearance
of the first three tails,

130
00:16:02,714 --> 00:16:05,753
but after the fourth, his
mind was over powered.

131
00:16:05,787 --> 00:16:09,293
All that was left was a
hunger for destruction.

132
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,214
-And another thing I don't get.

133
00:16:19,248 --> 00:16:20,216
Why was I unconscious?

134
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,047
-Orochimaru attacked
you and knocked you out.

135
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,182
-Huh?

136
00:16:36,216 --> 00:16:36,784
I--

137
00:16:36,817 --> 00:16:38,688
[grunting]

138
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:39,723
-Oh, come on!

139
00:16:39,757 --> 00:16:42,061
Are you kidding me?

140
00:16:42,094 --> 00:16:42,544
Ugh!

141
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,827
-Sai's things are
scattered all over.

142
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:03,772
Why would he leave
his picture book?

143
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:06,378
Wow, your own picture book.

144
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:07,714
Oh.

145
00:17:07,747 --> 00:17:10,353
Would you mind if I took a look
at it while we're on the road.

146
00:17:10,353 --> 00:17:12,223
-I do, actually.

147
00:17:12,256 --> 00:17:15,196
It's just, I haven't
finished it yet.

148
00:17:15,229 --> 00:17:16,666
Anyway, I'm sorry.

149
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:19,205
I don't show it to other people.

150
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,109
-Oh.

151
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:23,713
It belongs to my older brother.

152
00:17:23,747 --> 00:17:25,283
-It doesn't make sense.

153
00:17:25,317 --> 00:17:28,223
This picture book was
Sai's prized possession,

154
00:17:28,223 --> 00:17:29,626
yet here it is,
tossed on the ground.

155
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:36,240
YAMATO: To have left
something so precious behind.

156
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,244
Even he must have been
pretty rattled by dealing

157
00:17:38,244 --> 00:17:40,548
with Orochimaru.

158
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:43,755
-You talk about it as if
you saw the whole thing.

159
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:46,193
-I didn't, but the wood
clone I stationed here

160
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:48,699
did, and thanks to
our wireless radios,

161
00:17:48,732 --> 00:17:50,836
I was in contact with
him 'til just now.

162
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,773
-Hm?

163
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:55,646
-Well, then just
what happened to Sai?

164
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:57,483
-Two things.

165
00:17:57,516 --> 00:18:00,622
First, Sai had a
conversation with Orochimaru.

166
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:02,861
Then he left with
them and Kabuto.

167
00:18:02,894 --> 00:18:04,430
-Huh?

168
00:18:04,464 --> 00:18:05,533
But, why?

169
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:07,269
What do you think it means?

170
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:08,539
-What was it they talked about?

171
00:18:08,573 --> 00:18:11,912
-They were too far away
for my clone to overhear.

172
00:18:12,147 --> 00:18:13,549
-I wonder.

173
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:15,487
What could he have said to him?

174
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,292
-Maybe he was forced to
go along against his will.

175
00:18:18,326 --> 00:18:19,294
-Kidnapped?

176
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:21,198
It didn't appear that way.

177
00:18:21,232 --> 00:18:25,508
No, Sai approached Orochimaru
and gave him something.

178
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:29,182
It's almost like he was
trying to ingratiate himself.

179
00:18:29,215 --> 00:18:30,384
-Hang on.

180
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:31,887
Sai may be one of the
biggest jerks I've ever met,

181
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:35,227
but you're not really saying
that he'd betray us, are you?

182
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:36,263
-Wait.

183
00:18:36,296 --> 00:18:37,599
It's possible.

184
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:38,200
What?

185
00:18:45,182 --> 00:18:49,323
-Long ago, Danzo and
the late Sarutobi-sensei

186
00:18:49,356 --> 00:18:53,666
competed with each other
for the type of Hokage.

187
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:54,868
They were polar opposites.

188
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:57,707
He's the founder of a hardline
martial faction founded

189
00:18:57,707 --> 00:18:59,377
on rigid principles.

190
00:18:59,411 --> 00:19:01,648
He's also Sai's superior.

191
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,187
As a student of the
moderate Third Hokage

192
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:07,862
and granddaughter of the
First Hokage, he despises me.

193
00:19:12,337 --> 00:19:12,972
-Captain Yamato.

194
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:15,344
Do you know a man named Danzo?

195
00:19:15,344 --> 00:19:16,713
-Yes, I know him.

196
00:19:16,746 --> 00:19:18,416
-I've never heard of the guy.

197
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,518
Who is he?

198
00:19:19,552 --> 00:19:20,888
-He's a member of
the Hawk faction

199
00:19:20,921 --> 00:19:23,393
that once opposed
the Third Hokage.

200
00:19:23,426 --> 00:19:24,963
-And Sai's superior.

201
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:29,438
A geezer who doesn't think too
highly of the Third's legacy.

202
00:19:29,472 --> 00:19:31,644
-Sai making contact
with Orochimaru

203
00:19:31,677 --> 00:19:33,748
could be part of a
move on Danzo's part.

204
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:42,265
It's possible that Sai
has his own mission.

205
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,771
One entrusted to him by Danzo.

206
00:19:44,771 --> 00:19:49,714
Some kind of covert mission, and
one very separate from our own.

207
00:19:49,747 --> 00:19:53,655
-So, then, this whole
mission, he was using us?

208
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:55,259
Just playing us
all along until he

209
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:57,763
could get in touch
with Orochimaru?

210
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,467
-That's the gist of it.

211
00:20:02,674 --> 00:20:04,745
-This is only something
of a wild guess,

212
00:20:04,778 --> 00:20:08,653
but I have a feeling I
know what's going on here.

213
00:20:08,653 --> 00:20:09,922
Listen closely.

214
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:21,278
I think Danzo may be
plotting the destruction

215
00:20:21,312 --> 00:20:22,280
of the Leaf village.

216
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:31,968
[theme music]

217
00:22:00,382 --> 00:22:01,384
KABUTO: Lord Orochimaru.

218
00:22:01,418 --> 00:22:02,386
OROCHIMARU: Yes, Kabuto.

219
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,123
We're being followed.

220
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,796
I'm already well aware of it.

221
00:22:06,796 --> 00:22:10,537
-It might be a mere pursuit,
or it might be a trap.

222
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,806
OROCHIMARU: You suspect him?

223
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:14,144
KABUTO: Let's say I
don't trust him yet.

224
00:22:14,178 --> 00:22:16,582
OROCHIMARU: In any case,
he says with us for now.

225
00:22:16,616 --> 00:22:19,054
He could come in handy.

226
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:20,725
KABUTO: In other words--

227
00:22:20,758 --> 00:22:22,462
OROCHIMARU: Either
way you look at it, I

228
00:22:22,495 --> 00:22:25,835
believe a corpse is in order.

229
00:22:25,868 --> 00:22:28,942
NARUTO: Next time, The
Consequences of Betrayal

230
00:22:28,942 --> 00:22:31,546
[theme music]

231
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,711
-Today, I'll be talking about
the First Hokage's necklace.

232
00:22:46,744 --> 00:22:48,816
This crystal, worn
by the First Hokage,

233
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:51,054
was formed from a
rare kind of mineral.

234
00:22:51,087 --> 00:22:52,724
It's said that it's
worth three gold

235
00:22:52,757 --> 00:22:54,961
mines and the mountains
on top of them.

236
00:22:54,995 --> 00:22:57,132
To Tsunade, the First
Hokage's granddaughter,

237
00:22:57,166 --> 00:23:00,473
it's a precious memento
of her grandfather.

238
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:02,844
In the past, Tsunade
once gave the necklace

239
00:23:02,877 --> 00:23:06,118
to her younger brother, Nawaki,
and on another occasion,

240
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:10,126
to her lover, Dan, But
both of these loved ones

241
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,732
were taken from her
by war before they

242
00:23:12,732 --> 00:23:14,936
had a chance of fulfilling
their life's dreams.

243
00:23:14,969 --> 00:23:18,477
It was as if the necklace
would accept no other master

244
00:23:18,477 --> 00:23:20,738
than Tsunade, and it
was said that anyone who

245
00:23:20,771 --> 00:23:23,808
wore it would meet
an untimely end.

246
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,744
Many years have passed, and know
the necklace is worn by someone

247
00:23:26,777 --> 00:23:29,547
with the same hopes and
dreams as the others.

248
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,083
A young man named Naruto.

249
00:23:32,116 --> 00:23:34,785
Whether the results
are fortunate or fatal,

250
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:39,090
this is certainly Lady
Tsunade's riskiest gamble ever.
