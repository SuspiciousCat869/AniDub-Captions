00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:26,631
{\an1}We're done with these guys!

151
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:29,364
Let's go!

152
00:13:30,263 --> 00:13:33,163
Hey, I wanna get a
ride too, you guys!

153
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,563
{\an1}Don't track dirt in.

154
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:38,162
{\an1}Good grief. It's so crowded
in here. And it stinks!

155
00:13:38,195 --> 00:13:40,595
{\an1}This is part of teamwork!

156
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:43,327
{\an1}Why you-! You're running away?!

157
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:45,561
I won't let you!

158
00:13:45,594 --> 00:13:49,326
{\an1}Our team specializes in getting
into enemy territory,

159
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,791
{\an1}nabbing our target, and then
bringing it back home without
fail!

160
00:13:53,025 --> 00:13:57,957
{\an1}We got what we came for. So, as
far as we're concerned, this
battle is over.

161
00:13:58,324 --> 00:14:00,625
{\an1}Besides, you guys
can't touch us now.

162
00:14:01,657 --> 00:14:04,190
(Burami)
Buuuuh-Bye!

163
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:13,189
{\an1}You...! Come back
here! Hey, stop!

164
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:20,354
{\an1}Well, that's fine with us. Brag
all you want about running away

165
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:23,254
{\an1}but Team Kurenai's got
major sensory skills!

166
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:26,153
{\an1}We're pros at tracking, and
we've got a cool guy who

167
00:14:26,186 --> 00:14:29,886
{\an1}assesses every situation
calmly and comes up with
a plan of action!

168
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:31,086
...Shino!

169
00:14:31,118 --> 00:14:33,885
{\an1}We already have
contact with them.

170
00:14:33,918 --> 00:14:38,817
{\an1}The reason is because my
insects are now attached
to that giant mole.

171
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:45,682
[buzzing]

172
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:48,815
{\an1}I attached female insects...

173
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:52,715
{\an1}and nothing will stop the males
of that species from tracking
their delicate scent.

174
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,746
{\an7}My nose and Akamaru's nose
are both still completely
useless right now.

175
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:04,113
{\an7}We're counting
on your insects!

176
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:07,246
{\an1}Don't worry. I've
got this covered.

177
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:21,610
[buzzing]

178
00:15:21,642 --> 00:15:24,576
{\an1}They're close! That mole is
under here somewhere!

179
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,309
{\an1}All right!

180

{\an1}[irritated growl]

181
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:33,007
{\an1}What's the matter, Ranmaru?

182
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:49,871
Damn it! They
found the insects!

183
00:15:56,669 --> 00:16:01,635
{\an1}That's why I said don't track in
dirt! Ranmaru's a clean freak
with really sensitive skin!

184
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:05,701
They're escaping
underground again!

185
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:07,201
Damn it!

186
00:16:07,235 --> 00:16:10,268
{\an1}It's all right. I think I'm
close enough to see them now!

187
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:12,267
{\an1}Even underground, I
won't lose them!

188
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,033
{\an1}All right, Hinata!

189
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:15,867
Byakugan!

190
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,664
{\an1}Got them! At ten o'clock!

191
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:24,998
Right! They're
not getting away!

192
00:16:28,064 --> 00:16:30,663
{\an1}Looks like they're turning
toward one o'clock now!

193
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:34,096
{\an1}Hinata! How close am
I to that mole?

194
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:38,063
Six meters!

195
00:16:39,028 --> 00:16:43,195
{\an1}Akamaru! Man Beast Clone!
Fang Over Fang!

196
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:59,292
{\an1}The target is changing
direction to ten o'clock!

197
00:16:59,326 --> 00:17:00,959
Distance, seven
meters!

198
00:17:01,757 --> 00:17:03,824
{\an1}They won't escape!

199
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:11,157
And this time...
I won't miss!

200
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:15,189
{\an1}Keep going straight on ahead!
Five meters! Four meters!

201
00:17:15,223 --> 00:17:17,289
{\an1}Just a little bit further...

202
00:17:17,323 --> 00:17:18,988
{\an1}Only three meters now!

203
00:17:20,422 --> 00:17:22,921
{\an1}Ah! What is this?!

204
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:30,986
{\an1}What's happening?! The sand is
getting softer and softer...

of tag over already?

207
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:47,517
{\an1}This is seriously
not good...!

208
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,417
The sand is--

209
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,549
Yes, it's like a
bottomless swamp...

210
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,748
{\an1}I'm sinking really fast!

211
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,182
[gasp]

212
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:59,582
{\an1}This is exactly what they
planned to happen...
And we fell for it.

Hinata! [grunt]

221
00:18:25,577 --> 00:18:28,210
So this is it...

Shino...!

223
00:18:46,805 --> 00:18:50,005
{\an1}No one'll come after us now.
We're free and clear.

224
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,573
{\an1}Our teamwork won this!

225
00:18:51,605 --> 00:18:55,371
{\an1}Actually, to be honest,
I'd say I outshined the
rest of the team.

226
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:59,703
{\an1}It was 'cause my Moguranmaru
came through for us.

227
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:01,670
{\an1}You don't get it.

228

In any case, it'll be a smooth
ride to the finish line.

That was really quick
thinking on your part!
