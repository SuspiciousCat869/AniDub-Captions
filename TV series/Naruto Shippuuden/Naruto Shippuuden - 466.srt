can see things that other

00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:13,443
{\an1}And what exactly would that be?

144
00:10:45,502 --> 00:10:49,402
{\an1}But it's the older one who's
inherited the power of the
Sharingan, huh?

145
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:57,170
{\an4}You know, it's possible... that
out of consideration for his
older brother, the younger one
might not return home.

146
00:10:57,204 --> 00:10:59,103
{\an1}I'll deal with that
if it happens.

147
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:02,137
{\an1}What exactly is it that you're
looking to test with this?

148
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,638
{\an1}It isn't a test of anything.

149
00:11:04,672 --> 00:11:08,772
{\an1}The eldest may excel, but
because of his power, he
has no faith in love.

150
00:11:08,805 --> 00:11:14,172
{\an1}The younger one doesn't have
the same kind of skill, but
he overflows with love.

151
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:19,173
{\an1}I'm sure that Ninshu will come
to exert enormous influence in
this world.

152
00:11:19,207 --> 00:11:23,441
{\an1}And in order for Ninshu to take
the true and proper path...

153
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,641
{\an1}...both power and love
will be necessary.

154
00:11:26,841 --> 00:11:31,075
{\an1}<i>I want my sons to grow during</i>
<i>their journeys.</i>

155
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:35,943
{\an1}<i>...and, I hope, learn to nurture</i>
<i>Ninshu together.</i>

156
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:44,010
{\an1}Hey! Enough already!
Just come out.

157
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,711
{\an1}You knew I was here, huh?

158
00:11:46,744 --> 00:11:48,312
{\an1}Are you all right?

159
00:11:48,345 --> 00:11:51,479
{\an1}Yeah! As you can see...

160
00:11:51,513 --> 00:11:53,413
{\an1}Thanks for what you
did back then.

161
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,112
{\an1}Don't mention it. So,
what is it? What's up?

162
00:11:56,146 --> 00:12:01,047
{\an1}After you helped me get free, I
hid out in a shack on a hill in
the backcountry.

163
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,814
{\an1}Then Gasuka and Edashi.

164
00:12:03,847 --> 00:12:07,515
{\an1}I have big news! Ashura
is leaving on a journey!

165
00:12:07,548 --> 00:12:11,149
And that journey will
determine who the successor
of Ninshu will be.

166
00:12:11,182 --> 00:12:15,849
{\an4}Is what they said true?
Because, I mean, after I heard
that, I couldn't even sit still.

167
00:12:15,883 --> 00:12:18,016
{\an1}Listen, take me with you, okay?

168
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,983
{\an1}Boy, I don't know about that.

169
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:21,951
{\an1}Your mom's sick, isn't she?

170
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:25,251
{\an1}Nah, she's okay now.  It seems
that the medicine really worked
well.

171
00:12:25,284 --> 00:12:26,784
{\an1}She's back to normal!

172
00:12:26,817 --> 00:12:30,652
{\an1}Besides, I told her about you,
and she said I should go and
help out.

173
00:12:30,686 --> 00:12:33,852
{\an1}But I thought that your mom
hated Ninshu!  So why--?

174
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,119
{\an1}Aw, c'mon, those are
two separate things.

175
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:39,386
{\an1}A man's obligation comes
before hating Ninshu.

176
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,454
{\an1}You do realize that I'm
not gonna be coming home for
a long time, don't you?

177
00:12:43,487 --> 00:12:44,954
What? Seriously?

178
00:12:44,987 --> 00:12:49,155
{\an1}I'm certain that Elder Brother
will pass this test with
flying colors.

179
00:12:49,188 --> 00:12:54,389
{\an1}And if I don't return, then
Father will have no choice but
to pick him as his successor.

180
00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:57,056
{\an1}I see. That's so like you.

181
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:59,557
{\an1}So then, where do
you intend to go?

182
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:02,524
{\an1}Yeah, where should I go...?

183
00:13:02,557 --> 00:13:06,592
{\an1}Hey, didn't your dad say that
the people in the area where
you're supposed to go are having

184
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,058
{\an1}a rough time or
something like that?

185
00:13:09,091 --> 00:13:10,992
{\an1}So wouldn't it be bad if
you didn't help them out?

186
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:13,192
{\an1}Oh, yeah, I guess
that you're right...

187
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:16,527
{\an1}I'd better go, and I'll figure
out the rest of it later.

188
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,460
{\an1}All right!  Let's do it!

worry about it?

{\an1}No, all I'm able to

it with my chakra.

told me that the Divine Tree

Hey!  You're--!

286
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:07,627
{\an1}I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
need you go to sleep.

288
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,495
Uh, what are you doing?

289
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:15,361
{\an1}What were the Visual
Prowess signs again?

Huh?

00:20:18,062 --> 00:20:18,928
{\an1}This way is easier
and much faster.

{\an1}There's a cave here.

294
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:47,600
{\an1}Let's check it out.

295
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:06,270
{\an1}What is this place?

296
00:21:06,304 --> 00:21:08,704
{\an1}I didn't think it would
be like this inside!

297
00:21:08,737 --> 00:21:12,003
{\an1}I've heard legends about
the Divine Tree, but...

298
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:15,004
{\an1}This is--?!

299
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:21,773
{\an1}There's no doubt.
This is the Divine Tree.
