Nice to meet you all.

we're having a strategy
meeting here before we
go on a mission.

7
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:42,334
{\an7}Sorry, it's official

gotta go.

Eternal Genin!

{\an7}The Eternal
Genin?

14
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:03,000
{\an7}Just how long
have you been
doin' this?

15
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:07,334
This year will mark
50 years as a Ninja
for me. [chuckle]

16
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,267
50 years!? Wow,
that's amazing.

17
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:15,267
{\an5}But Captain Hayama,
isn't there someone a
little better suited
for this mission?

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,167
{\an1}Well, I personally
asked Kosuke
to join us.

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,834
{\an1}From everything I've
heard, he should
be very helpful.

20
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:23,567
{\an7}What'd you hear
about me!?

21
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:28,234
{\an7}<i>Well, I didn't ask for</i>
<i>you in particular, but I</i>
<i>needed another Genin, and</i>
<i>you're the one they sent.</i>

22
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:30,100
{\an7}Grrr...!

23
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,767
{\an7}Ok. Our mission
is to patrol the
Northern Boarder.

24
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:36,868
{\an7}We're only on
patrol? Ha! This'll
be the easiest
mission ever!

25
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:40,501
{\an4}<i>(Hayama)</i>
<i>Let's hope so. If nothing</i>
<i>goes wrong, it'll be an</i>

26
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:45,067
{\an4}<i>(Kayama)</i>
<i>But we can't take anything</i>

[gasps]

28
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:52,834
{\an4}The Hidden Leaf was
just destroyed. And other
lands may come at us while
we're weakened. Is that it?

29
00:01:52,868 --> 00:01:54,267
{\an1}<i>(Hayama)</i>
<i>Exactly, Tekuno.</i>

30
00:01:56,267 --> 00:02:00,400
{\an4}The point of this "easy"
mission, is to show
our strength and keep
our enemies in check.

31
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:05,567
{\an4}And we'll show all
of them that Hidden
Leaf Ninja are as
vigilant as ever.

32
00:02:19,234 --> 00:02:23,968
{\an1}[frustrated grunt]

anything dangerous
here yet!

34
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:30,701
{\an4}[chuckle]
Well I found some
nice mushrooms
for us to eat.

35
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:35,434
{\an4}Ugh! Listen, gramps!
You shouldn't just be
wandering around the
area like that!

36
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:39,467
{\an4}Captain Hayama ordered
us to search around
for enemy footprints,
remember!?

37
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:41,667
{\an4}No traces of the
enemy nearby.

38
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:43,133
{\an1}Yes, I agree.

39
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:45,100
{\an1}Wait, what do you
mean, "you agree"!?

40
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:48,567
{\an4}All you were
doing out there
was picking
mushrooms...

41
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,868
{\an1}I finished laying
all the traps!

42
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:55,133
{\an4}Kosuke, is there
some place suitable
for us to set up
camp?

43
00:02:55,534 --> 00:03:02,234
{\an4}Oh yes. I believe
the Second Hokage's
cave is very close
to where we are,

44
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:03,968
{\an1}Second Hokage?

45
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:07,000
{\an8}It's a cave I
found a long
time ago.

46
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:10,801
{\an8}Way back when
I came here in
service to the
Second Hokage.

47
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:13,100
{\an8}That was seriously
a long itme ago!

48
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:16,167
{\an8}Well, when you've
been a Genin for
50 years as I have-

49
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,634
{\an8}Chances are that you
have worked with many
who've gone on to
become great  masters.

50
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:25,534
{\an4}<i>(Kosuke)</i>
<i>I even had the chance </i>
<i>to work along side the</i>
<i>renowned Lord Jiraya.</i>

51
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,434
{\an1}<i>One of the </i>
<i>legendary Sannin!</i>

52
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:32,467
{\an4}<i>And I also teamed up with</i>

<i>White Fang, back when they</i>
<i>were both young.</i>

53
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:35,767
{\an7}I dunno... Sounds
like some pretty
tall tales to me,
pops!

54
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:45,767
{\an4}Say, Naruto... Would
you mind catching me
some crab or fish with
that net of yours?

55
00:03:45,968 --> 00:03:49,734
{\an4}I can't! My
assignment is to
examine whatever
floats downstream!

56
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:51,767
{\an1}You can catch
them while you
do that!

57
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:53,534
{\an1}No way! I
gotta focus!

58
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:58,000
{\an4}The captain told
me to see if any
evidence of an enemy
floats by here! Huh?

59
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:02,200
{\an1}Whoa! Huh?

60
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:04,801
{\an1}Ooo, not
bad!

61

The traps are
laid! Huh?

smells delicious!

delicious too!

{\an5}Heh heh, well
I guess I better
go get our beds
ready.

66
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:33,968
{\an1}I told you
he'd be good
to have around!

67

You were right!
He is helpful!

68

caught the fish

70
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,601
{\an4}Hey! You there! Do
you intend to spend
the rest of your
life as a Genin?

71
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,133
{\an1}How goes it?

72
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:27,033
{\an1}Huh? Oh.
All clear.

73
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:30,267
{\an4}It would be
idel if we
encountered
no enemy.

up on me like that,
old man!

Well, no signs of
an enemy in this
area.

81
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:56,100
Tsk. And how
did you figure
that out so fast?

82
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:58,767
Simple! These
birds here!

83
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:02,267
{\an5}If they sensed other
humans nearby, I
wouldn't have caught
them so easily.
