1
00:00:07,056 --> 00:00:10,994
{\an1}<i>Younger brother Ashura</i>
<i>has reincarnated as you. </i>

2
00:00:11,027 --> 00:00:14,365
{\an1}These eyes of mine can
clearly see Ashura's
chakra.

3
00:00:14,397 --> 00:00:18,636
{\an1}I can see it clinging all
about you.

4
00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:22,107
{\an7}<i>Could that be...? </i>

5
00:00:22,908 --> 00:00:26,212
{\an1}And considering your obvious
lack of surprise about it...

6
00:00:26,245 --> 00:00:31,751
{\an1}...perhaps you have actually
sensed little brother Ashura's
presence inside you already.

7
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:33,587
Hm.

8
00:00:34,388 --> 00:00:39,127
{\an1}As I had  surmised... So then
you also ought to know already.

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,664
{\an1}...who the reincarnate of
elder brother Indra must
be...

10
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:47,269
Hm.

11
00:00:52,776 --> 00:00:54,477
It's Sasuke.

12
00:01:01,752 --> 00:01:03,956
Sasuke did that?

13
00:01:04,756 --> 00:01:07,226
{\an1}That's... unbelievable.

14
00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:17,972
[whimpering]

15
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:19,273
And that's why-

16
00:01:19,307 --> 00:01:22,410
{\an1}I want you guys to let me
handle Sasuke.

17
00:01:22,444 --> 00:01:26,415
{\an1}You want to fight Sasuke
alone?! Do you honestly
think we would all go along

18
00:01:26,449 --> 00:01:28,217
{\an1}with something like that?!

19
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:33,522
{\an1}Like Tenten says, Naruto, we
can't always let you do what
you want all by yourself.

20
00:01:33,556 --> 00:01:37,561
{\an1}The reason is because this
is a big problem for the
whole village.

21
00:01:37,594 --> 00:01:39,563
{\an1}Look, I'm not being
selfish.

22
00:01:39,596 --> 00:01:43,134
{\an1}I know you swore you'd go
into full details when we got
back, but...

23
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:45,404
{\an1}I never thought you
would say this!

24
00:01:45,437 --> 00:01:49,908
{\an1}All of us here have made up
our minds to eliminate Sasuke!
You can't do this alone!

25
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:54,647
{\an1}Listen, Naruto... I hope
you're not just saying you're
going to take down Sasuke...

26
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:58,219
{\an1}...when you're actually
planning to protect him.

27
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:02,523
{\an1}I'm not. Trust me, I have
no intention of protecting
Sasuke.

28
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:09,798
{\an1}<i>Sasuke must have been</i>
<i>greatly weakened... </i>

29
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:13,403
{\an1}...by fighting at the Five
Kage Summit against Danzo.

30
00:02:13,436 --> 00:02:15,805
Why not take him
down right then?

31
00:02:15,838 --> 00:02:20,310
{\an1}Madara Uchiha was there! So
it wouldn't have gone that
easily if we tried.

32
00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:20,911
And besides--

33
00:02:20,944 --> 00:02:22,514
{\an1}<i>That's no excuse...! </i>

34
00:02:22,546 --> 00:02:25,250
{\an1}You shouldn't have let him
get away like that!

35
00:02:25,283 --> 00:02:31,424
{\an4}C'mon, Naruto! You're
strong, aren't you? You're
the village hero that took
down Pain, remember?

36
00:02:31,457 --> 00:02:32,725
{\an1}Hero...?

37
00:02:32,758 --> 00:02:35,895
{\an1}Yeah! You could've taken
Sasuke down like you did
with Pain!

38
00:02:35,928 --> 00:02:37,264
{\an1}No, that isn't true.

39
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:38,698
Why?

40
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:42,270
{\an1}You can't beat Sasuke...

41
00:02:42,303 --> 00:02:45,606
...just by being
strong. 'Cause now I know...

42
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:51,046
{\an1}Inside of him is...

43
00:02:55,285 --> 00:02:56,820
{\an1}I'm right, aren't I?

44
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:42,142
{\an1}"The Sage of the Six Paths"

45
00:04:42,175 --> 00:04:46,447
{\an1}<i>The elder brother Indra has</i>
<i>been reincarnated in you. </i>

46
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,817
{\an1}And these eyes of mine can
clearly see...

47
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,487
{\an1}... Indra's chakra
clinging all about you.

48
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:01,831
{\an1}And considering your obvious
lack of surprise about it...

49
00:05:01,864 --> 00:05:07,571
{\an1}...perhaps you have actually
sensed elder brother Indra's
presence inside you already?

50
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:14,512
{\an1}As I had surmised... so then you
also ought to know already...

51
00:05:14,546 --> 00:05:18,150
{\an1}...who the reincarnate of
younger brother Ashura must
be...

52
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:24,757
Naruto.

53
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,226
{\an1}Isn't that right?

54
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:30,632
{\an1}<i>Indeed. So you were aware. </i>

55
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:35,270
{\an1}You make it sound like
there's been other... what
is it? 'Reincarnates'

56
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:36,771
{\an1}before Sasuke and me?

57
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:39,008
{\an1}So what happened to them?
Who were they?

58
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:46,182
{\an1}The reincarnates just before
you two were Hashirama Senju
and Madara Uchiha.

59
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:53,190
{\an1}<i>Hashirama was Ashura. Madara</i>
<i>was Indra. You know how they</i>
<i>ended up, don't you? </i>

60
00:05:53,224 --> 00:05:58,463
{\an1}<i>Though Madara created a</i>
<i>certain problem before he</i>
<i>finished being a reincarnate.</i>

61
00:05:58,698 --> 00:06:03,835
{\an1}<i>He was so obsessed with</i>
<i>power... that he stole some</i>
<i>of Hashirama's. </i>

62
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,375
{\an1}<i>Which, in short,... caused</i>
<i>the merging of a part of</i>
<i>Ashura's chakra... with</i>

63
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,377
{\an1}<i>Indra's chakra...</i>

64
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:14,915
{\an1}<i>And in turn resulted in</i>
<i>the derivation of my own</i>
<i>chakra's power. </i>

65
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:20,456
{\an1}That's right... the
awakening of the Rinnegan.

66
00:06:22,224 --> 00:06:28,831
{\an4}<i>I always thought that such a</i>
<i>fellow would appear... among</i>
<i>either Indra or his</i>
<i>reincarnates.</i>

67
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:35,707
{\an1}Which is why I left behind
that stone tablet, with guidance
on reforming one's thinking.

68
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:38,976
{\an1}Though it seems no one
understood its meaning.

69
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,581
{\an1}So then, Super Gramps
Sage. Basically, it's like
you've been watching  your

70
00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:45,851
{\an1}kids' sibling rivalry
this entire time?

71
00:06:45,884 --> 00:06:48,054
{\an1}Yes. I suppose so...

72
00:06:49,657 --> 00:06:51,359
{\an1}I see.

73
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:56,364
{\an1}Ninshu, my Ninja Creed,
preached that chakra is
power that links people.

74
00:06:56,397 --> 00:07:00,535
{\an1}And I continue to truly
believe that chakra should
not be something that is

75
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:04,407
{\an1}used to amplify any single
person's strength.

76
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:09,646
{\an1}<i>Even after my mother,</i>
<i>Kaguya, put an end to</i>
<i>chaotic times, she ruled</i>

77
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,715
{\an1}<i>through her power alone. </i>

78
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:17,455
{\an1}<i>However, my mother's power</i>
<i>bred arrogance within her.</i>
<i>And mankind began to dread</i>

79
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:19,724
{\an1}<i>the existence of that power.</i>

80
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,529
{\an1}<i>That's why mother, who'd</i>
<i>been called the Rabbit</i>
<i>Goddess, at some indefinite</i>

81
00:07:23,562 --> 00:07:27,199
{\an1}<i>point started being feared</i>
<i>as a demon. </i>

82
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:31,938
{\an7}If power is concentrated
within only one person, it
will run wild, and that

83
00:07:31,972 --> 00:07:34,207
{\an7}person will become possessed
by it.

84
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:39,547
{\an1}<i>The current Madara is a</i>
<i>perfect example. He's</i>
<i>become just like my mother. </i>

85
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:44,386
{\an1}<i>Since he's no longer Indra's</i>
<i>reincarnate, he's obtained</i>
<i>Ten Tails' power and is</i>

86
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,921
{\an1}<i>getting close to me. </i>

87
00:07:45,954 --> 00:07:50,226
{\an1}<i>And he's trying to obtain</i>
<i>even my mother Kaguya's</i>
<i>power. </i>

88
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,899
{\an1}<i>The Infinite Tsukuyomi</i>
<i>doesn't just cast Genjutsu</i>
<i>over you. </i>

89
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:59,438
{\an1}<i>It traps you in Genjutsu</i>
<i>dreams, so the caster can</i>
<i>use your individual power</i>

90
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:01,339
{\an1}<i>while keeping you alive. </i>

91
00:08:01,373 --> 00:08:06,077
{\an1}<i>You're attached to the</i>
<i>roots of the Divine Tree and</i>
<i>turned into living slaves.</i>

92
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,916
{\an1}<i>That's what the Infinite</i>
<i>Tsukuyomi is. </i>

93
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:13,220
{\an1}<i>Mother possessed the power</i>
<i>of Sharingan as well as</i>
<i>Byakugan. </i>

94
00:08:13,253 --> 00:08:19,394
{\an1}<i>She used her Visual Prowess</i>
<i>to cast that jutsu upon the</i>
<i>populace. It was ghastly. </i>

95
00:08:19,427 --> 00:08:24,900
{\an1}<i>If all chakra were to be</i>
<i>reunited into one again, a new</i>
<i>Chakra Fruit would take shape.</i>

96
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:27,904
{\an1}<i>That must be prevented at</i>
<i>all costs... </i>

97
00:08:27,938 --> 00:08:31,575
{\an1}...or this world will end.

98
00:08:31,608 --> 00:08:35,178
{\an1}Now... I would like you to
stop Madara.

99
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,085
{\an1}Your slightly dumb
personality unlike the
other reincarnates...

100
00:08:41,118 --> 00:08:46,558
{\an1}<i>I feel the possibility</i>
<i>exists there, in your</i>
<i>maverick nature.</i>

101
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,929
{\an7}So you still believe in
us, even though the world
you've watched over

102
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,931
{\an1}for all this time...

103
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:55,001
{\an1}... even after you've
died, is messed up.
So thank you.

104
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,908
{\an1}Don't thank me for this. I
don't have any right to your
praise.

105
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:05,480
{\an1}If the world as it is today
desires Indra's, or
rather my mother's, way

106
00:09:05,514 --> 00:09:08,250
{\an1}of doing things... And if
that's the natural flow...

107
00:09:08,283 --> 00:09:13,757
{\an1}<i>Then I'm the one who's</i>
<i>selfishly trying to go</i>
<i>against it and stop it. </i>

108
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,962
{\an1}Even simply in terms of how
the Tailed Beasts are being
used, not for maintaining

109
00:09:17,996 --> 00:09:21,399
{\an1}peace and balance, but only
as weapons...

110
00:09:21,432 --> 00:09:24,769
{\an1}Perhaps my way of
approaching things is just
naive.

111
00:09:24,803 --> 00:09:26,005
{\an1}<i>Nope! </i>

112
00:09:26,037 --> 00:09:28,607
{\an1}You're not wrong, Super
Gramps Sage!

113
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:30,676
{\an1}<i>That's right, old man! </i>

114
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:31,711
Huh?!

115
00:09:34,314 --> 00:09:35,515
Huh?!

116
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:39,453
{\an1}You're Gaara's Shukaku!
Why are you inside me?

117
00:09:39,654 --> 00:09:42,123
{\an1}<i>That guy Obito... </i>

118
00:09:42,156 --> 00:09:43,524
Eight-O!

119
00:09:43,558 --> 00:09:47,930
{\an1}He forcibly extracted a
piece of each of our chakra
from Madara.

120
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:53,636
{\an1}He knew exactly which Tailed
Beasts' power you lacked.
He's somethin', that guy.

121
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,771
{\an1}Obito did?!

122
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:56,406
{\an1}A lot's happened.

123
00:09:56,439 --> 00:09:57,106
{\an1}Huh?

124
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,944
{\an1}He even put me inside you.

125
00:09:59,977 --> 00:10:05,282
{\an1}Now you've got the chakra
of all Nine Tailed Beasts in
you, Naruto!

126
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:07,954
{\an1}Even you? The other half of
Kurama?

127
00:10:07,987 --> 00:10:13,292
{\an1}The promised time's finally
come, old man Six Paths!

128
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:16,295
My dear Kurama,
you're right.

129
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:18,031
{\an1}As Gamamaru foresaw...

130
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:21,970
{\an1}A blue-eyed youth who can
name all nine Beasts and
frolic among them.

131
00:10:22,003 --> 00:10:26,174
{\an1}Foresaw? You mean the
prophecy Giant Gramps Sage
told Pervy Sage?

132
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:28,944
{\an1}Ah, so his real name is
Gamamaru?

133
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:32,281
{\an1}You're pretty awesome for
knowing that, Super Gramps,
ya know?

134
00:10:32,314 --> 00:10:33,917
Hey, Naruto!

135
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,150
Heh?

136
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:36,920

the ability to win others'
cooperation.

138
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:46,430
{\an1}You managed to summon my
soul and accepted that Ashura's
reincarnated inside you...

{\an1}What do you want to do? What
is it that you seek for the

{\an1}Maybe I really am a whole
lot like this Ashura guy...

149
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:42,629
{\an4}Only, unlike him, I'm
just a stupid kid and don't
understand many things in
this world.

{\an1}Is that your response, then?

Yeah.

154
00:11:56,211 --> 00:12:01,551
{\an1}Long ago, I entrusted
everything to little brother
Ashura... and didn't pay any

{\an1}attention to elder brother
Indra.

156

{\an1}That proved to be the source
of calamity.

00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,982
{\an1}What you both shall do, and
what shall transpire, will
be up to the two of you.

Sasuke and I...

164
00:12:35,057 --> 00:12:39,996
{\an1}...may not be real brothers,
but I believe we can make
peace.

165
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:43,299
{\an1}Because we're pretty good
friends.

die without his Tailed

174

Huh?

{\an7}You're the first since
Hashirama to make me this

00:16:05,134 --> 00:16:08,637
{\an1}There's no rush. The
Academy won't run
away, will it?

202
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:11,640
{\an1}There's a set time to

208
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,566
{\an1}No, Dad. You're wrong.
That's not it. He actually

209
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,437
{\an1}failed the Academy
Entrance Exam.

210
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,174
{\an7}Oh, beg your pardon! I just
assumed... since you were in
front of the academy...

211
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:44,279
{\an1}Quite all right! Don't
worry!

{\an1}But Dad, you were a whole
lot ruder just a minute ago.

215
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:55,893
{\an1}Besides, he's trying to get
into the ninja academy even
though it seems he can't

216
00:16:55,926 --> 00:16:57,661
{\an1}use ninjutsu at all...

217
00:16:57,694 --> 00:16:59,663
{\an1}I just don't think...

218
00:16:59,696 --> 00:17:03,935
{\an1}Whoops, we gotta get going,
or we're going to be late,
