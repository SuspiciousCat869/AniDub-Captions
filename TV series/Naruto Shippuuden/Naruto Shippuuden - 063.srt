1
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,747
-Sora will be rounding
out Team Kakashi,

2
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:15,682
while Sai is in recovery.

3
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,317
Because of that,
I'd like to practice

4
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,254
some new formations
to get us all in sync.

5
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:20,948
-Yes, sir.

6
00:00:20,948 --> 00:00:21,522
-What?

7
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:22,256
Come on.

8
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:23,390
We could skip that.

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,527
Let's just get back to
my Wind chakra training.

10
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,095
-Well, what do you
know about that?

11
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,464
The reject has a point for once.

12
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,599
-You're a laugh a
minute, you know that?

13
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:33,433
Oh.

14
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:34,468
That's right.

15
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,004
Captain Yamato, I
almost forgot something.

16
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,605
I wanted to ask you
a couple of questions

17
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,241
about the manipulation
of chakra nature.

18
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,176
-Well, all right.

19
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,246
But then I want you focused
on the rest of our training.

20
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,247
-Yeah, OK.

21
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,282
You got it.

22
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:49,483
YAMATO: Well, shoot.

23
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:50,617
What do you want to know?

24
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,586
-You said before that
you create the Wood Style

25
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,989
by combining the Earth and
Water styles together, right?

26
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,391
-Yes, that's correct.

27
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,027
Earth and Water are the two
properties of chakra nature

28
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,261
that I have mastery of.

29
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,131
-Kakashi sensei's talked
about this a lot in training.

30
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,234
He said when you're a jounin
you can learn more of them.

31
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:10,337
Will I eventually pick up
Water Style or something, too?

32
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,105
-I see.

33
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,707
Hard to say, really.

34
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,976
You're either born
with it or you're not.

35
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,112
Each of us has an affinity
for different chakra.

36
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,480
Though, I guess
only time will tell

37
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:23,116
if you have an affinity
for Water Style chakra.

38
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,385
-So I guess no matter
how hard I try then,

39
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:29,056
I can't learn something that
isn't there to begin with.

40
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,292
-Anyway, Naruto, your
fundamental attribute is wind.

41
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,428
Even if you were to
show signs of others,

42
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,463
they would be much weaker.

43
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,665
To cultivate a second
or third property,

44
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:42,603
jounin train themselves
to use that weaker chakra.

45
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:45,105
-That means it's got to be
really rare for somebody

46
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,374
to obtain all five then, right?

47
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,642
-Not exactly.

48
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:52,012
No shinobi has ever managed
to master all five of them.

49
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,080
It's never happened.

50
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,717
At least, not to my
knowledge anyway.

51
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,518
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): So then--

52
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:05,525
-Wind Style, Scattering
Flower Dance.

53
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,994
-Then how could she do that?

54
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,100
-Was that the only
question you had?

55
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,401
Because we have a
lot of formations

56
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,636
that we need to get to.

57
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,505
[laughter]

58
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,440
-It's not like they're
a permanent team.

59
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,075
Why bother drilling them?

60
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:23,644
Seems kind of pointless.

61
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,078
-Hey, Asuma.

62
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:27,581
-I mean, for starters,
Naruto doesn't really

63
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,216
think before he acts.

64
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,618
And Sora's cut from
the same cloth.

65
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,353
-Don't lump me in with him!

66
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:34,755
-What is it with you?

67
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,258
-Both of them are heavy hitters
who like diving into the fray.

68
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,994
Just put them up front and
let them do their thing.

69
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:44,531
You and Sakura just back
them up as best you can.

70
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,466
-Harrumph!

71
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,369
-I don't disagree
with you, but--

72
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,305
-Backing these two up
should be a lot of fun.

73
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,974
-Oh, brother.

74
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,976
-Seriously, they're
not going to pick up

75
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,678
new formations overnight.

76
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,413
Give them a little
time to find a rhythm.

77
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:03,050
They'll comrades
before you know it.

78
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,651
-Which means that for now--

79
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,387
-Those formations will
just have to wait.

80
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,088
[sigh]

81
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,456
-Asuma is right.

82
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,325
So for the time being, you can
all keep training individually,

83
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,293
OK?

84
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,995
-All right!

85
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,530
-So I guess that
means we could pick up

86
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,665
where we left off on
my training, right?

87
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,433
Can we?

88
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,767
How about it, Captain?

89
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:21,968
-Oh.

90
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,304
Well, we'd need
Kakashi here for that.

91
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:27,441
But hey, maybe Asuma
here could help you.

92
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,643
You're on standby right
now, aren't you, sensei?

93
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,245
[grunt]

94
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,481
-I'm sure he can teach
you a thing or two.

95
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:38,652
After all, he has the same
Wind Style chakra you two do.

96
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:39,286
-All right!

97
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,120
Let's do it!

98
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,754
-I'm ready, Asuma sensei.

99
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:41,488
-Hey.

100
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,522
I asked him first.

101
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,256
-So what?

102
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,224
You think I care?

103
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,592
NARUTO [growl]:
Get lost, will ya?

104
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,993
SORA: Oh, shut up, you freak!

105
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,228
ASUMA (VOICEOVER): Dropped
his mess right in my lap.

106
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:48,695
NARUTO: Hey!

107
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,530
What'd you say?

108
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,998
[japanese theme song]

109
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,693
-So you two did all this, huh?

110
00:05:44,693 --> 00:05:45,928
-You betcha.

111
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:46,962
-Whatever, loser.

112
00:05:46,962 --> 00:05:48,597
More than half of them are mine.

113
00:05:48,631 --> 00:05:50,032
-He's lying through his teeth.

114
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:50,699
-All right.

115
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:51,166
That's it.

116
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,868
You want to go?

117
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:54,403
-Gya, gya.

118
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:56,171
-What the-- what
the hell was that?

119
00:05:56,405 --> 00:05:57,706
-Easy, kid.

120
00:05:57,706 --> 00:05:59,842
You two aren't my
responsibility.

121
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,176
This is a favor.

122
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,679
Now pipe down and grab a kunai.

123
00:06:03,712 --> 00:06:06,849
Get a mental image of your
Wind chakra, and throw them.

124
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:07,883
[sigh]

125
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:11,453
-Still didn't have
to swat us like that.

126
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:12,955
All right, keep watching.

127
00:06:12,988 --> 00:06:13,956
I'll show you something.

128
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,807
ASUMA (VOICEOVER): Hmm.

129
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,677
This much power without
using chakra blades?

130
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,045
Not too shabby.

131
00:06:38,747 --> 00:06:39,982
-Well, Asuma sensei?

132
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,384
I'm way better than
this guy, right?

133
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:43,118
-What?

134
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,887
Look again, you dimwit.

135
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,821
-You got a problem?

136
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:46,855
-All right, pay attention.

137
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,031
Notice anything different?

138
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:56,632
-Huh?

139
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:01,103
SORA: The hole is smaller.

140
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:02,905
-Exactly so.

141
00:07:02,938 --> 00:07:06,041
This is visualization
training to increase

142
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:08,444
the accuracy of
your Wind chakra.

143
00:07:08,477 --> 00:07:10,412
The holes you made
tell me you were

144
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:12,948
imagining that
tree's destruction.

145
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:16,852
When you should have been
envisioning Wind chakra.

146
00:07:16,885 --> 00:07:19,955
Your minds we're distracted from
the chakra's lighter, sharper

147
00:07:19,988 --> 00:07:22,891
nature.

148
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:25,427
In other words, the
more you're distracted,

149
00:07:25,427 --> 00:07:26,962
the bigger the hole.

150
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:28,464
-Oh, I get it.

151
00:07:28,497 --> 00:07:31,433
So the hole you made was
equal to your distraction.

152
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:32,968
-It wasn't as big
as yours, though.

153
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:34,036
-Say what?

154
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:36,071
You could cram three
squirrels into yours.

155
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:37,439
-Yours could hold five.

156
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,507
-Yours could fit seven.

157
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,541
-Oh yeah.

158
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:40,809
ASUMA (VOICEOVER):
They should both be

159
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:44,413
able to do it because they're
chakra is so exceptional.

160
00:07:44,446 --> 00:07:46,749
Naruto, of course,
but Sora, too.

161
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,156
-It's not about
how many you throw.

162
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,992
Focus on the image
each and every time.

163
00:07:57,025 --> 00:07:57,893
-Gotcha.

164
00:07:57,926 --> 00:07:58,961
-Yes, sir.

165
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:01,563
-Be precise with
your Wind chakra.

166
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:02,164
-Let's do it.

167
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,866
-I'm not giving up.

168
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:04,833
-Huh?

169
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,135
[grunt]

170
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:06,735
[grunt]

171
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:07,536
[grunt]

172
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:09,438
[grunt]

173
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,773
ASUMA (VOICEOVER):
This is Sora's.

174
00:08:10,806 --> 00:08:12,975
[music playing]

175
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:44,139
-So we've gotten more than.

176
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:45,941
Was it from Chiriku?

177
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:47,142
-Mm.

178
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:49,812
I'm afraid a rather interesting
detail regarding Sora

179
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:50,846
has come to light.

180
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:04,927
-Kazuma is Sora's father?

181
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,863
-Well, that part's
water under the bridge.

182
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:09,565
The issue is what happens later.

183
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:14,436
-This is a secret
we've protected.

184
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,604
But--

185
00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:17,906
CHIRIKU (VOICEOVER): About
10 years ago, a tragedy

186
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,442
brought the Fire Temple to
the brink of destruction.

187
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,950
I had received a report,
and rushed to the temple.

188
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:32,688
-The temple.

189
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:34,056
CHIRIKU (VOICEOVER):
I found myself

190
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:37,526
looking upon a scene
straight out of a nightmare.

191
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,761
The pride of the Fire Temple.

192
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:42,764
The Iron Wall Seal had
been utterly destroyed.

193
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:49,505
-Out of the way.

194
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:52,574
Stretcher coming through.

195
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:54,476
[groan]

196
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,143
-Hey.

197
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,745
Are you OK?

198
00:09:56,778 --> 00:09:57,846
-Lord Chiriku.

199
00:09:57,846 --> 00:09:59,882
-What on earth happened?

200
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:04,486
-I don't know, but whatever it
was, my lord, it wasn't human.

201
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,121
-I-it wasn't human?

202
00:10:06,154 --> 00:10:07,956
What do you mean?

203
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:10,993
-The creature was
shrouded in evil.

204
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:11,593
[grunt]

205
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:12,828
-Easy.

206
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:15,597
-We'll take him.

207
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:16,465
This is horrific.

208
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:23,805
-What happened here?

209
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,108
-I have no idea.

210
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:29,411
Sora just went crazy
without warning.

211
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:32,114
Something happened to the boy.

212
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:34,683
We tried to stop
him, but you can

213
00:10:34,683 --> 00:10:37,119
see how well that turned out.

214
00:10:37,152 --> 00:10:39,821
-Sora did this?

215
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:41,456
CHIRIKU (VOICEOVER):
Needless to say,

216
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,958
we ran has body
through a battery

217
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,860
of physical examinations.

218
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:46,428
But we never found the cause.

219
00:10:49,064 --> 00:10:51,700
We had Sora under
constant surveillance.

220
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,569
But he never had
another episode.

221
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:59,107
But those who remember
the incident loathe him.

222
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:02,678
And fear his inexplicable power.

223
00:11:02,711 --> 00:11:03,612
The boy is ostracized.

224
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:08,483
YAMATO (VOICEOVER):
So that's why

225
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:11,920
Sora felt like he
didn't belong there.

226
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:14,523
-They still don't know the
reason why it happened?

227
00:11:14,556 --> 00:11:15,958
-No idea.

228
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:18,427
Unfortunately, the
cause of Sora's rampage

229
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,762
continues to remain a mystery.

230
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:23,065
-So there you have it.

231
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:27,069
And Chiriku is
rightfully concerned.

232
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:29,705
It seems he'd like to get
our assessment, as well, as

233
00:11:29,738 --> 00:11:31,907
long as the boy is visiting.

234
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,910
-Understood, my lady.

235
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:37,446
The similarities are uncanny.

236
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,148
[grunt]

237
00:11:40,182 --> 00:11:41,116
-They sure are.

238
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:47,556
-All right, then.

239
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:48,724
Pick it up tomorrow morning.

240
00:11:48,757 --> 00:11:50,092
It's getting dark out.

241
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:50,926
-What?

242
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:51,960
Tomorrow? Really?

243
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,061
-Yes.

244
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:55,097
He's gonna train
us tomorrow, too.

245
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:55,831
-That's awesome.

246
00:11:55,864 --> 00:11:56,965
-All right.

247
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:58,867
-Uh, wait, I uh-- oh.

248
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,435
Well, that's just great.

249
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,570
NARUTO AND SORA: All right!

250
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,437
All right!

251
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:04,740
[tapping]

252
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:21,231
NARUTO: OK.

253
00:12:21,264 --> 00:12:23,333
I'm going to train
like crazy today!

254
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:23,967
SORA: What?

255
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,034
That's not fair!

256
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,211
[growl]

257
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:36,112
-One more time.

258
00:12:36,145 --> 00:12:37,881
-I'm just warming up.

259
00:12:37,914 --> 00:12:39,249
-Unbelievable.

260
00:12:39,282 --> 00:12:41,317
Their stamina levels are insane.

261
00:12:43,953 --> 00:12:46,689
Not only do they railroad
me into training them,

262
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:49,058
they scrub food off of me, too.

263
00:12:49,058 --> 00:12:50,627
-Hee hee hee.

264
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,828
-Heh heh.

265
00:12:51,861 --> 00:12:52,962
-Here you go .

266
00:12:52,996 --> 00:12:54,898
Sorry to keep you waiting.

267
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:56,332
NARUTO AND SORA:
Thanks for the food!

268
00:12:56,332 --> 00:13:00,703
[slurping]

269
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:02,071
-Ahh.

270
00:13:02,071 --> 00:13:03,673
ASUMA: Check please.

271
00:13:03,673 --> 00:13:04,774
-Sure, you bet.

272
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:06,709
-And thanks for dropping in.

273
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:07,610
-Yeah.

274
00:13:07,644 --> 00:13:10,179
I am stuffed.

275
00:13:10,213 --> 00:13:10,947
-All right.

276
00:13:10,947 --> 00:13:12,682
End of the road, fellas.

277
00:13:12,715 --> 00:13:15,218
I can't watch out
for you guys anymore.

278
00:13:15,218 --> 00:13:17,687
You'll have to get the
hang of it on your own.

279
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:18,888
-Yeah, totally.

280
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:20,924
I'll master it no problem.

281
00:13:20,957 --> 00:13:23,192
-Hey, you might want to
clean that sash there.

282
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:25,194
It's filthy.

283
00:13:25,194 --> 00:13:28,698
-Oh, well, it's seen a lot
of service, that's all.

284
00:13:28,731 --> 00:13:29,666
-Oh, yeah?

285
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:31,134
My dad's was always
nice and clean.

286
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:31,734
-Huh?

287
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:36,072
-It's so strange.

288
00:13:36,105 --> 00:13:38,608
I don't remember my
dad's face very well.

289
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:43,313
But still, I'll never forget
that spotless sash he wore.

290
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:47,951
To me, my father is that
dazzling white light itself.

291
00:13:47,984 --> 00:13:51,287
Now when I think back on him,
that's always what I see.

292
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:53,823
But then I hear
people talk about him,

293
00:13:53,856 --> 00:13:56,059
saying he was killed for
trying to seize power

294
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:58,294
in The Land of Fire.

295
00:13:58,328 --> 00:13:59,796
Whatever.

296
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:01,764
I think most of the time, people
were just gossiping about him

297
00:14:01,798 --> 00:14:03,266
intentionally so I would hear.

298
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:04,867
That's why I got a thank you.

299
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:07,203
I can't tell you how happy I
was when you cleared that up

300
00:14:07,203 --> 00:14:08,738
for me, old man.

301
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:10,340
[grunt]

302
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,741
-OK, then.

303
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:13,810
Time to get in
some more training.

304
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,011
-Hey. No fair.

305
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:15,878
-Sora, wait.

306
00:14:18,314 --> 00:14:19,048
Come on.

307
00:14:19,082 --> 00:14:20,650
Walk with me for a bit.

308
00:14:20,683 --> 00:14:21,851
It's just about time.

309
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:26,356
OK.

310
00:14:26,356 --> 00:14:27,924
This is it.

311
00:14:27,957 --> 00:14:30,293
-So what are we here for?

312
00:14:30,326 --> 00:14:31,361
-Hey, pops.

313
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:33,262
That thing ready yet?

314
00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:36,799
-Oh, hey, Asuma.

315
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,802
I had a hard time getting
my hands on this much metal.

316
00:14:39,836 --> 00:14:41,671
[clinking]

317
00:14:41,704 --> 00:14:42,972
-Here.

318
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:44,040
-Hey, wait a minute.

319
00:14:44,073 --> 00:14:44,807
Is that really--

320
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:47,777
[chime]

321
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,079
-Those are my-- but how?

322
00:14:50,113 --> 00:14:53,049
-I had your claws fixed
with the same materials used

323
00:14:53,082 --> 00:14:55,218
in my chakra blades, kid.

324
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:56,686
Well, what do you think?

325
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:58,688
These are pretty much
your style, right?

326
00:14:58,688 --> 00:14:59,789
[chuckle]

327
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:00,990
-Amazing.

328
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:03,126
I just didn't feel right
without these, that's for sure.

329
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,327
-No doubt.

330
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,330
So how long have you
been using them for?

331
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,097
