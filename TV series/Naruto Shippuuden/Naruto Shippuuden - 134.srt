PAIN: Jiraiya, one of the
legendary Sannin, is no more.

3
00:00:19,566 --> 00:00:21,366
If we didn't have
this secret of ours,

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,066
we probably wouldn't
have won this fight.

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,066
Let us make sure to
extol our former teacher.

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,600
By the way, you
can come out now.

7
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,866
-That fight sure
took you a while.

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,866
-His opponent was
Jiraiya, after all.

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,233
-That was quite an interruption.

10
00:00:41,266 --> 00:00:43,500
Madara ordered me to
hunt the Nine-Tails,

11
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:45,666
and its time I got back to that.

12
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,900
WHITE ZETSU: Well,
then, I'd love

13
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:51,433
to see you hunt the Nine-Tails,
so let's go together.

BLACK ZETSU: No.

15
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:54,600
There's another
battle I want to see.

-Oh.

17

-Shut up.

18

WHITE ZETSU: Which
other battle is that?

BLACK ZETSU: You'll see.

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,733
SUIGETSU: I wonder
if Sasuke's OK.

21
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:15,366
-What's that mean?

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,633
SUIGETSU: What do you think?

23
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:20,400
What if the first Akatsuki
hideout we is a bullseye?

24
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:21,566
-Wait a minute.

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,400
Are you saying that
Itachi is in this hideout?

26
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:29,500
-I don't know, I
only said what if.

27
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:32,933
This Itachi's supposed to
be pretty strong, isn't he?

28
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:34,100
-No.

29
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:35,500
There's no way that
Sasuke could lose to him.

30
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:36,766
No way.

31
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,600
-Well, I hope not.

32
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:41,200
But maybe we should be planning
for the worst-case scenario

33
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:43,600
here.

-All right, I'm going
to check inside.

If anything happens,
we're going in.

-We're what?

38
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,800
And why are you taking
over all of a sudden?

39
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,833
Boy, when it comes to Sasuke,
you always go overboard.

40
00:01:57,866 --> 00:01:58,833
-No, I don't!

41
00:01:58,866 --> 00:02:00,700
That just isn't true at all!

Fine, I won't go, you idiot!

43
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:04,833
-Then I'll ask the birds.

44
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:06,866
I'll have them scour
the entire area

45
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,666
and keep an eye out for the
approach of any enemies.

-Damn.

47
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:13,600
Just listen to you two.

SUIGETSU (VOICEOVER):
They're so diligent.

49
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,666
-It's no good.

50
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,200
This trail's a fake, too.

51
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:29,400
I know that finding
Sasuke's scent is good news,

52
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:32,633
but the enemy keeps staying
one step ahead of us.

53
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:33,966
-Yeah, I know.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,833
So we're compensating for their
tricks with greater numbers.

55
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:39,366
-Well, we've searched
this area completely.

56
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
-Yeah, let's report
back to the original

57
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:43,300
and tell him we found
a whole lot of nothing.

-What's wrong, Naruto?

59
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,266
-All the scents in the south
forest were only false leads.

-I see.

61

-Hey, don't look
so down, Naruto.

62
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:01,066
I thought you never
give up, no matter what.

63
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,800
Isn't that your ninja way?

64
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,200
-Naruto, he's right.

65
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,600
-All right.

66
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:10,900
I'll use the chakra
that I've restored

67
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,966
and increase the number
of shadow clones.

68
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,233
I'm counting on you guys.

69
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,366
-Just leave it to us.

go crazy and attack me

time, are you, Sasuke?

-It's like you said, brother--
I fostered my hatred for you.

All this time,
I've lived my life

for one single
purpose-- to kill you!

nothing about me, Itachi.

You have no idea how much hatred
I carry for you in my heart

and just how strong I've
become because of that hatred.

if at the next shedding

he remains a snake
or becomes a hawk.

You're really something, Sasuke.

What was that?

Besides, the only reason I've
been traveling with a team

is so nothing would
get in the way of my

00:12:23,888 --> 00:12:26,954
Aren't you, Suigetsu?

164
00:12:26,988 --> 00:12:29,388
So maybe I should
cut you down to size.

165
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:30,621
-Listen.

166
00:12:30,654 --> 00:12:33,388
Shouldn't we just
obey Sasuke's orders?

167
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:35,854
KARIN (VOICEOVER): Don't
be stupid, you blockhead.

168
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:36,821
You're such a dunce.

169
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:53,719
-Come on, guys.

170
00:12:53,752 --> 00:12:56,819
This way!

171
00:12:56,852 --> 00:12:58,952
-Wait, Naruto!

172
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,819
What's that chakra?

173
00:13:00,852 --> 00:13:02,552
-Howdy!

174
00:13:02,586 --> 00:13:03,052
-What?

175
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,819
TOBI: Well, now, how's it
going there, there and there.

176
00:13:10,852 --> 00:13:13,919
Imagine running into Hidden
Leaf folks in a place like this.

177
00:13:13,952 --> 00:13:18,286
And it's two, four,
six, eight against one!

178
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:20,152
What bad luck!

179
00:13:20,186 --> 00:13:22,019
-Wait, those robes.

180
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,519
You're a member of
the Akatsuki, too.

181
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:29,752
-Although he wasn't on that
roster that Kabuto gave to us.

182
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:31,086
TOBI: I'm kinda new here.

183
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:32,852
Nice to meet you.

184
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:33,552
-Hmm.

185
00:13:33,586 --> 00:13:34,986
Think you're funny, huh?

186
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:37,319
Look, buddy, don't
waste our time.

187
00:13:37,352 --> 00:13:38,586
-Don't be rash.

188
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:42,052
We need to wait and see,
study the situation first.

189
00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:44,152
We do have a numbers advantage.

190
00:13:44,186 --> 00:13:45,386
-Oh, dear.

191
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:47,952
Am I being underestimated?

192
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:49,052
By you guys?

[music playing]

194
00:13:52,352 --> 00:13:53,786
-So he's an Akatsuki.

195
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:58,152
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Another weirdo.

196
00:13:58,186 --> 00:14:00,319
I can't believe they
keep getting between us

197
00:14:00,352 --> 00:14:04,719
and Sasuke over and over again.

198
00:14:04,752 --> 00:14:06,186
-Huh?

199
00:14:06,219 --> 00:14:08,586
-Get out of our way!

200

-Shadow clone?

201
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:15,819
Just kidding.

202
00:14:23,086 --> 00:14:26,152
-Seems you're more
proficient with the blade

203
00:14:26,186 --> 00:14:27,819
than that kid was.

204
00:14:27,852 --> 00:14:29,986
SUIGETSU: Kid?

205
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:31,852
Do you mean Master Zabuza?

206
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:39,519
-My broadsword,
Samehada, was never

207
00:14:39,552 --> 00:14:41,786
intended for this kind
of thing, you know.

208
00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:43,152
It's not for dueling.

209
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,819
-Same here.

210
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:51,286
This one's for killing!

211
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:58,719
-And this is what he calls fun?

212
00:14:58,752 --> 00:14:59,519
As if.

213
00:14:59,552 --> 00:15:01,152
They're both dead serious.

214
00:15:01,186 --> 00:15:02,486
Hey, Jugo.

215
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,319
Would you just tell him that--

216
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:05,719
-It'll be all right.

217
00:15:05,752 --> 00:15:07,219
All the birds are
telling me there's

218
00:15:07,252 --> 00:15:11,152
no one nearby who will come to
interfere with their fighting.

219
00:15:11,186 --> 00:15:12,519
KARIN (VOICEOVER): Damn it.

220
00:15:12,552 --> 00:15:14,952
What if something happens to
Sasuke while these idiots are

221
00:15:14,986 --> 00:15:16,852
playing their little game?

222

And the Hidden Leaf are
still coming after us.

Wait-- the Hidden Leaf's
movements have stopped?

224

TOBI: You are so
full of yourself.

225
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:27,686
I mean, what can a kid
like you really do?

226
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,686
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Oh, Naruto.

227
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:47,919
Thank goodness.

228
00:15:47,952 --> 00:15:53,386
SAKURA: Hinata, Naruto can
take whatever he dishes out.

229
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,219
Do not take your
eyes off the enemy.

analyzing my strength

231
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:01,119
right now?

Is that what you're doing?

233
00:16:02,386 --> 00:16:05,286
Boy, you guys from the
Hidden Leaf sure are clever.

234
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:08,086
But tell the truth-- for
a newbie, I'm pretty good.

235
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:10,686
Don't you think?

236
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:14,086
-He's dodged them, every
one of Naruto's attacks.

-He's toying with us.

But why?

239
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,219
What is he after?

240
00:16:24,686 --> 00:16:26,319
SUIGETSU (VOICEOVER):
This guy packs way

241
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,452
more power into his
blade than I do.

242
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:31,352
All right, then.

you being better than Zabuza.

Ah, too bad.

there, didn't I?

-Why are you so excited?

Haven't you realized yet
that it's snack time for me?

Snack time?

But how?

00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,752
I haven't used up that much yet.

255
00:17:02,786 --> 00:17:07,052
-My Samehada here grinds
up and absorbs chakra.

256
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:10,019
I thought for sure you would
have noticed it before now.

257
00:17:10,052 --> 00:17:14,886
Tell me, would you
care for another taste?

258
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:16,352
-Why, you.

259
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:20,986
-Now then, what shall we
play next, Hidden Leaf folks?

260
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,519
-We don't have time to play
around with the likes of you.

261
00:17:23,552 --> 00:17:25,186
-That's right.

262
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:30,052
-It's because we've got
to track down Sasuke ASAP.

get to participate

to retrieve Sasuke.

are surrounding me!

-Whoa, dear.

You got me.

Split up and force your
way through his defenses!

the whacking, not
the other way around.

ITACHI (VOICEOVER): My
foolish little brother.

332
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:07,665
So you've finally
come to confront me.

333
00:22:07,698 --> 00:22:10,798
It looks like you've been
waiting for this moment.

334
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:16,965
Well, so have I. So come,
show me what you've got.

335
00:22:16,998 --> 00:22:20,265
Bring to life the death you've
always envisioned for me.

00:22:24,831 --> 00:22:28,665
How much can you actually
see with those eyes?
