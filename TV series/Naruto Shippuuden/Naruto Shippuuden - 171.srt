{\an1}Hey, it's a river.

136
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,809
And the path.

137
00:07:14,842 --> 00:07:16,711
This way.

138
00:07:16,744 --> 00:07:18,780
OK, you guys, on
to the next one.

139
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:19,881
Just follow me.

140

{\an1}-Use your brain for a change.

141
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,550
{\an1}-And what does that mean?

142
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:25,252
{\an1}-We need to read this scroll.

143

We can't afford
any more missteps.

{\an1}all the information we need
to get through the obstacles

-Hmm.

148
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:37,196
{\an1}-That way we can find
solutions before we even

{\an1}reach the problems.

{\an1}-And besides, you're
always jumping the gun

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,836
{\an1}and putting everyone
here in danger, Naruto.

152

{\an1}-Aw, don't say that.

I can do that.

-Ugh.

161
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:01,585
{\an1}Naruto, what are you doing?

162
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:03,053
{\an1}-Being nimble and determined.

163

Huh?

00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:07,758
-Oh, you idiot!

166
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,093
{\an1}-We have no choice.

167
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:09,659
Jump on!

168
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:15,163
{\an1}-Are you even capable
of listening at all?

169
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:18,200
{\an1}-I'm just following what the
Tiger Scroll told us to do.

170
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:19,334
-Um.

171
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:21,503
{\an1}-Hey, does the current
seem faster to you guys?

172
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:23,639
{\an1}-Uh, you think it's
because of that?

173
00:08:23,672 --> 00:08:24,139
-What?

174
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:29,511
-Waterfall!

175
00:08:29,544 --> 00:08:31,480
{\an1}-We're gonna crash
into that big rock.

176
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:34,382
{\an1}-Even if you miss the rocks,
you'll go over the waterfall.

177
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:36,350
{\an1}-Why'd you say "you," not "we"?

178
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:38,285
{\an1}-I'm just assessing
this objectively.

179
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:39,320
-Stop it, guys.

180
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,755
{\an1}-At least I'm doing
something to help.

181
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,657
{\an1}-What did you say?

182
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,359
-Shut up!

183
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:47,560
Damn.

184
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,663
{\an1}What does that scroll mean
by "show determination"?

185
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,730
{\an1}NARUTO: What's that?

186
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:51,564
-Huh?

187
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:52,866
-That big rock.

188
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,368
{\an1}It's a tiny version of the
Leaf's great stone faces.

189
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:55,869
-What?

190
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,976
{\an1}-Shikamaru, what do we do?

191
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,145
-Think fast, or
we're gonna crash.

192
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:05,844
-Huh.

193
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,047
{\an1}Show determination, huh?

194
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,817
{\an1}-Determination is
what I do best.

195
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,751
-Naruto.

196
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:16,854
{\an1}-No matter what, I'm going to
get the Fourth Hokage's legacy.

197
00:09:16,888 --> 00:09:18,856
{\an1}-Naruto, how many times do I--

198
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,991
-No.

199
00:09:20,024 --> 00:09:22,192
{\an1}This time Naruto's right.

200
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:24,294
{\an1}Jump to the right.

201
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:24,796
-Whoa!

202
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:29,199
-Yah!

203
00:09:29,232 --> 00:09:30,168
Ugh!

204
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,134
Ack!

205
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:33,603
Oof!

206
00:09:33,637 --> 00:09:35,271
{\an1}SHIKAMARU: I see.

207
00:09:35,304 --> 00:09:38,474
This was set up
beneath the waterfall.

208
00:09:38,507 --> 00:09:41,744
{\an1}A rainbow forms on the left
where the water sprays,

209
00:09:41,777 --> 00:09:44,480
{\an1}but it doesn't on
the right side.

210
00:09:44,513 --> 00:09:47,883
{\an1}If we'd chosen the left side,
then we would have fallen down.

211
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,652
{\an1}-Would you hurry up
and move already?

212
00:09:49,685 --> 00:09:50,820
{\an1}You're really heavy.

213
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:51,519
-What?

214
00:09:51,553 --> 00:09:52,888
{\an1}You're calling me heavy?

215
00:09:52,922 --> 00:09:55,423
{\an1}Why don't you try looking in
the mirror, thunder thighs?

216
00:09:55,457 --> 00:09:56,224
-You heard me.

217
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:57,726
{\an1}I'm calling you heavy, Ino pig.

218
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,394
{\an1}-Oh, stop kidding
yourself, billboard brow.

219
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:03,363
-This fight has
nothing to do with me.

220
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:04,465
Yep.

221
00:10:04,498 --> 00:10:06,467
{\an1}NARUTO: All three of
you are really heavy.

222
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,367
-Hmph!

223
00:10:07,401 --> 00:10:08,402
-Huh?

224
00:10:08,435 --> 00:10:10,637
-What?

225
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:13,173
{\an1}-Naruto, you don't
have a shred of tact.

226
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:15,341
INO: I really do
pity you, Sakura.

227
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:17,376
{\an1}Being stuck on a team
with a guy like that?

228
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,745
{\an1}SAKURA: Tell me about it.

229
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:19,979
CHOJI: No doubt.

230
00:10:20,013 --> 00:10:20,713
-What?

231
00:10:20,747 --> 00:10:21,314
What did I do?

232
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,690
{\an1}All right, we've reached
the final obstacle.

233
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:33,024
[gasping]

234
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:34,559
{\an1}-Ino, what's this?

235
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,728
{\an1}-Choji, knock it off.

236
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:40,966
{\an1}-Sorry, Naruto, but we're
going alone from here on out.

237
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:44,002
{\an1}-We're taking the Fourth
Hokage's legacy for ourselves.

238
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:45,203
-But wait.

239
00:10:45,237 --> 00:10:46,771
{\an1}It's just not fair.

240
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:49,440
{\an1}-We're going to make sure
Shikamaru wins no matter

241
00:10:49,473 --> 00:10:50,241
what it takes.

242
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:53,677
{\an1}-This is our chance, Shikamaru.

243
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:54,344
{\an1}CHOJI: Shikamaru?

244
00:10:58,048 --> 00:10:59,449
{\an1}SHIKAMARU: Go beyond hatred.

245
00:10:59,482 --> 00:11:03,052
{\an1}For the one who approaches,
the path will not open.

246
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:06,089
{\an1}That's what the rest
of the scroll says.

247
00:11:06,122 --> 00:11:07,991
{\an1}And maybe what that's
trying to tell us

248
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:09,424
is that the path
won't open if you

249
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,993
{\an1}have a falling out
with your comrades.

250
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,397
[chuckling]

251
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,201
{\an1}-Now you're starting to
sound like a decent guy.

252
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:23,272
{\an1}You're really becoming
a pain, you know?

253
00:11:23,304 --> 00:11:24,206
-Ha, ha, ha.

254
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:26,207
{\an1}A noble idea, Shikamaru.

255
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:27,675
[sigh]

256
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,342
-Somehow I just
knew that everything

257
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:32,712
{\an1}was going to turn out like this.

258
00:11:32,747 --> 00:11:34,215
-Shikamaru?

259
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:34,714
-Yeah?

260
00:11:37,517 --> 00:11:38,418
Uh.

261
00:11:38,451 --> 00:11:39,986
Um.

262
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,623
{\an1}-Let's get through this
together and meet in the finals.

263
00:11:43,657 --> 00:11:46,993
{\an1}SHIKAMARU: Here, this is yours.

264
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:49,562
Keep it.

265
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:52,131
{\an1}-You actually think you're
going to be in the finals?

266
00:11:52,164 --> 00:11:53,331
-She's right.

267
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:55,801
{\an1}Sasuke's the one who's
going to advance and win.

268
00:11:55,835 --> 00:11:57,236
-Aw.

269
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:59,939
{\an1}-Well, as long as it's
someone from the Hidden Leaf.

270
00:11:59,972 --> 00:12:01,273
{\an1}That's all I care about.

271
00:12:01,307 --> 00:12:02,208
-Yeah.

272
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:04,008
{\an1}Now, that's the right attitude.

273
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:05,510
{\an1}All right, let's go!

274
00:12:08,378 --> 00:12:10,248
{\an1}-Too bad for you.

275
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:14,118
{\an1}You guys won't make it
to the final rounds.

276
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:16,353
You won't be as
lucky as last time.

277
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:19,323
[laughter]

278
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:27,997
-Whoa.

279
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,801
{\an1}SAKURA: All these scrolls have
secret techniques inside them?

280
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,070
{\an1}SHIKAMARU: Uh, I don't know.

281
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:36,339
{\an1}SAKURA: And we're supposed
to find the Hokage's legacy

282
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:37,974
in one of them?

283
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,374
-Aw.

284
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:42,477
{\an1}-And time's still ticking away
on the Fourth Hokage's record

285
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,445
while we search.

286
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:44,512
-Ugh.

287
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:45,847
{\an1}Look, we know the
Fourth Hokage's legacy

288
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:47,514
{\an1}is here somewhere.

289
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:49,783
{\an1}We'll open every single
scroll if we have to.

290
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:50,952
SHIKAMARU: Stop.

291
00:12:50,986 --> 00:12:51,986
-Huh?

292
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,054
{\an1}-Look at the size of this place.

293
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:57,224
{\an1}And who knows what kind of
traps have been set here.

294
00:12:57,258 --> 00:12:58,424
-Argh.

295
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,194
{\an1}-Besides, look at the scrolls.

296
00:13:00,227 --> 00:13:02,296
They're probably
all fakes anyway.

297
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:03,230
{\an1}-They're all fake?

298
00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:04,365
-That's right.

299
00:13:04,397 --> 00:13:06,267
{\an1}And it would take the
five of us several days

300
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,700
{\an1}to search through
them all to find

301
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:09,736
{\an1}the real one among
the forgeries.

302
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:14,974
{\an1}We'd never break the Fourth
Hokage's record time that way.

303
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:17,310
{\an1}There has to be something.

304
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:19,145
Something.

305
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:20,812
Some way.

306
00:13:20,846 --> 00:13:22,281
{\an1}-A way to do what?

307
00:13:22,314 --> 00:13:24,383
{\an1}-Aw, use your head, Naruto.

308
00:13:24,415 --> 00:13:27,052
-Stupid Naruto.

309
00:13:27,085 --> 00:13:28,786
{\an1}-That's a terrible thing to say.

310
00:13:28,819 --> 00:13:29,754
{\an1}ACCUSING VOICE: Stupid.

311
00:13:29,787 --> 00:13:31,022
That's stupid.

312
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:31,656
Stupid.

313
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:32,391
Stupid.

314
00:13:32,423 --> 00:13:32,823
Stupid.

315
00:13:32,857 --> 00:13:33,758
Stupid.

316
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,026
That's stupid.

317
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:36,327
{\an1}-Give me a break.

318
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,662
{\an1}Stop saying that, Sakura.

319
00:13:38,696 --> 00:13:40,530
{\an1}-No, that wasn't me.

320
00:13:40,563 --> 00:13:41,098
-Huh?

321
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:41,564
-Stupid.

322
00:13:41,598 --> 00:13:42,300
Stupid.

323
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,234
Stupid.

Stupid Naruto.

325
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:44,935
Stupid.

326

{\an1}-Hey, knock it off, parrot.

327
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:48,505
{\an1}Just who do you think you
are, calling me stupid?

328
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:49,706
-Stupid Naruto.

329
00:13:49,739 --> 00:13:51,440
Stupid Naruto.

330
00:13:51,473 --> 00:13:52,375
-Argh!

331
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:54,910
{\an1}Quit calling me stupid,
you stupid bird!

-Stupid Naruto.

333
00:13:55,945 --> 00:13:56,413
Stupid.

00:13:56,445 --> 00:13:56,912
-What?

335
00:13:56,946 --> 00:13:57,646
You little--

336
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,587
{\an1}-Ninja art, Grudge Rain.

337
00:14:06,621 --> 00:14:08,424
One on one, we
can't overcome them.

338
00:14:08,456 --> 00:14:10,625
{\an1}But if we gather up
our grudge and use

339
00:14:10,658 --> 00:14:14,028
{\an1}it to put a curse on them
with this Jutsu, then we can.

{\an1}[thunder rumbling]

341
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,132
Envelop them in
this cursed cloud

00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,567
{\an1}and rain our grudge
down upon them.

{\an1}SAKURA: My strength.

356
00:14:39,318 --> 00:14:41,988
{\an1}I'm draining away.

357
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:43,856
{\an1}-This is no ordinary water.

358
00:14:46,558 --> 00:14:49,428
{\an1}-This rain will leach
away all of your chakra.

359
00:14:49,462 --> 00:14:52,397
{\an1}It's a deluge of bitter
tears from all of the grudges

{\an1}that we hold against you.

{\an1}SASUKE: You guys were knocked
out of the Chunin Exam.

00:14:57,035 --> 00:14:58,036
{\an1}-What are you doing here?

363
00:15:01,406 --> 00:15:04,708
{\an1}-I usually don't like
to do what Kakashi says.

-He's that guy.

00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:07,610
{\an1}-But I have to agree.

366
00:15:07,643 --> 00:15:10,114
{\an1}This is the perfect
chance to test my Jutsu.

{\an1}-He's acting strange.

00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,992
{\an1}This could be our big chance.

373

-Forget it.

374
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:24,193
No way.

we're safe for now.

{\an1}Was that part of the trap?

{\an1}-Well, I'm starving.

387

-What?

{\an1}For the one who approaches,
the path will not open.

440
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:34,846
{\an1}SAKURA: And I guess that
meant the gate wouldn't

441
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,948
{\an1}open as long as Naruto
kept chasing the parrot.

00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:41,853
-Huh?

443
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,722
{\an1}It's here, the Fourth
Hokage's legacy.

lines of the poem.

{\an1}The location of infinity
falls to the anointed one.

-Whoa.

447
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:52,596
{\an1}Does that mean the scroll
contains everything

448
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,864
{\an1}that we were after?

449
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:57,967
{\an1}-I guess, although there
could some unimaginable trap.

450
00:17:58,001 --> 00:17:58,868
-No way.

451
00:17:58,902 --> 00:18:00,638
{\an1}I trust the Tiger Scroll.

452
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,439
{\an1}I mean, that wise old
sage gave it to us.

-Huh.

three talking about?

bushier-brows Sensei?

-Ugh.

466
00:18:38,872 --> 00:18:42,042
{\an1}-Naruto still believes
that's really an old sage.

467
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:43,709
{\an1}-Well, wise old sage?

468
00:18:43,743 --> 00:18:45,178
{\an1}So what's the deal?

469
00:18:45,212 --> 00:18:47,880
Did we break the
Fourth Hokage's record?

470
00:18:47,913 --> 00:18:49,516
Did we make it?

471
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:52,818
{\an1}Please, I really, really want
the Fourth Hokage's legacy.

472
00:18:52,851 --> 00:18:54,220
{\an1}I just gotta have
it if I'm gonna

473
00:18:54,253 --> 00:18:55,689
make it through
the final rounds.

474
00:18:55,721 --> 00:18:57,122
-Ahem.

475
00:18:57,156 --> 00:18:57,623
-Um.

476
00:19:00,526 --> 00:19:00,992
-Well?

477
00:19:01,025 --> 00:19:01,460
Well?

478
00:19:01,493 --> 00:19:01,960
Well?

479
00:19:01,993 --> 00:19:03,094
Well?

480
00:19:03,127 --> 00:19:04,430
-Good job.

481
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:07,966
{\an1}You five shattered the Fourth
Hokage's previous record.

482
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:09,200
-Yes!

483
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:11,703
{\an1}-And now I shall present
you with the Fourth Hokage's

484

{\an1}legacy, the ultimate secret.

-Mm-hmm?

486
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:15,772
Mm-hmm?

487
00:19:15,806 --> 00:19:17,174
-OK.

488
00:19:17,207 --> 00:19:19,843
{\an1}Just read the first character
of each verse across the page.

489
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:22,412
{\an1}Goodbye and good luck, you.

490
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:23,914
{\an1}-That's so obvious.

491
00:19:23,947 --> 00:19:25,048
{\an1}NARUTO: Um, let's see.

492
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:26,949
Close the blade.

493
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:29,252
{\an1}And then you shall
calm the heart.

494
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:30,253
Hold on.

495
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:32,154
I don't get it.

496
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:33,155
What's it mean?

497
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:35,558
-A blade with a
heart means ninja.

498
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,058
-Oh, yeah.

499
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:36,926
Thanks.

500
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:38,294
All right, then.

501
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:43,765
{\an1}It spells out, there's no
shortcut to becoming a ninja.

502
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:45,200
-Huh?

503
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:46,635
-Aw.

504
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:47,902
-Nice work.

505
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,304
-Thanks.

506
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:52,039
{\an1}I think it gave him some good
training for the final rounds.

507
00:19:52,072 --> 00:19:54,008
{\an1}-And we were able to
assess their mastery

508
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,010
{\an1}of their techniques.

509
00:19:56,043 --> 00:19:59,380
{\an1}Sasuke, you're taking too
long to release that Jutsu.

510
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:02,849
{\an1}You'd better not use
it in the final rounds.

511
00:20:02,882 --> 00:20:04,984
-I know.

512
00:20:05,018 --> 00:20:06,287
{\an1}-We're leaving, Guy.

513
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,590
{\an1}Sasuke still needs to
do some more training.

514
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:10,523
-You bet.

515
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:13,626
{\an1}Just leave the rest to me.

516
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,161
{\an1}-I can't believe this.

517
00:20:15,194 --> 00:20:18,096
{\an1}Was this whole thing just a
joke Guy Sensei played on us?

518
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:18,897
-I know.

519
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,533
{\an1}I'm just as disappointed as you.

520
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:23,468
{\an1}-And setting up such
dangerous traps was just mean.

521
00:20:23,502 --> 00:20:26,338
{\an1}Doesn't he have anything
better to do with his time?

522
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:28,173
{\an1}SHIKAMARU: Don't be
so quick to judge him.

523
00:20:28,206 --> 00:20:29,174
{\an1}-What do you mean?

524
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:30,676
{\an1}-Didn't any of you
guys notice what

525
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:33,578
{\an1}happened after we went through
all of those obstacles?

526
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:35,547
-Huh?

527
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,481
{\an1}-At first we were
all only thinking

528
00:20:37,515 --> 00:20:39,950
about our own
individual team winning.

529
00:20:39,984 --> 00:20:40,884
-Oh.

530
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:42,286
{\an1}Yeah, that's true.

531
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,954
{\an1}And now we just want someone
from our village to win.

532
00:20:44,988 --> 00:20:47,057
{\an1}It doesn't matter who.

533
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,992
-Mm-hmm.

534
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:49,959
-Hmm.

535
00:20:49,993 --> 00:20:51,861
{\an1}NARUTO: I've got it!

536
00:20:51,895 --> 00:20:53,330
-Huh?

537
00:20:53,363 --> 00:20:55,732
{\an1}-I know what the Fourth
Hokage's legacy means.

538
00:20:55,765 --> 00:21:00,035
{\an1}See, "no shortcut" means we
have to take the long way.

539

{\an1}Sakura, Shikamaru, Choji, Ino.

540
00:21:03,372 --> 00:21:05,708
{\an1}We have to do the
obstacle course again,

541
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:08,477
{\an1}but take the long way.

542
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,312
-Argh!

543
00:21:11,346 --> 00:21:14,349
{\an1}-Boy, he really is such a pain.

544
00:21:14,382 --> 00:21:15,450
-Stupid Naruto.

{\an1}NAGATO (VOICEOVER):
And the very next day,

546
00:21:16,951 --> 00:21:19,886
{\an1}the final rounds of
the Chunin Exam began.

{\an1}-I want to hear your stories.

549
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,213
{\an1}Then I'll give you
my final response.

550
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:01,281
-Very well.

551
00:23:01,314 --> 00:23:04,884
{\an1}We'll tell you everything
about our pain.

552
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:06,786
{\an1}-Nagato, it's a waste of time.

553
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,986
{\an1}Just deal with him now.

-Wait, Konan.

555
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,925
{\an1}I want to hear his response.

556
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,226
{\an1}After all, he did
crush the Six Pains

557
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,562
{\an1}and make it here all by himself.
