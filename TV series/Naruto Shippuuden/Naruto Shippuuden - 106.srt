00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:14,314
‐Yukimaru!

2
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,721
YUKIMARU (VOICEOVER):
It's OK, Guren.

3
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:27,661
‐The tailed beast was
going berserk a moment ago.

4
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,662
What happened?

5
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,634
‐Could it be?

6
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:49,382
Yukimaru, is he here?

7
00:00:49,415 --> 00:00:52,650
[theme music]

8
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,707
‐Everyone all right?

9
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:41,441
I hope.

10
00:02:41,474 --> 00:02:42,543
‐Yes, Lee, we're fine.

11
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:43,610
Thank you.

12
00:02:43,644 --> 00:02:45,445
‐We've all used up a
whole lot of chakra.

13
00:02:45,478 --> 00:02:46,847
Otherwise, we're all right.

14
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,582
(SHIZUNE VOICEOVER):
But we have to see

15
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:51,451
the limits of the
Three‐tailed Beast's chakra.

16
00:02:54,354 --> 00:02:56,089
‐Captain Yamato.

17
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:57,591
‐Yes, Kiba, I know.

18
00:02:57,624 --> 00:03:01,835
Nevertheless, our first priority
at the moment is to regroup.

19
00:03:01,868 --> 00:03:04,437
We will join the
Sealing Team as ordered.

20
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,807
‐Right.

21
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,209
KAKASH (VOICEOVER)I: What
could have a happened up there?

22
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,080
‐I'm worried about the others.

23
00:03:14,114 --> 00:03:15,716
Let's pick up the pace.

24
00:03:15,749 --> 00:03:16,216
‐Got it.

25
00:03:32,198 --> 00:03:33,667
‐Hm.

26
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,668
What's going on?

27
00:03:42,643 --> 00:03:46,613
‐His power surged when
he saw Guren threatened.

28
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:50,083
Well, well, I think this is
worth putting to the test.

29
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:17,984
‐You're all right.

30
00:04:18,018 --> 00:04:19,986
I'm glad you're
all right, Guren.

31
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:27,528
‐My mom.

32
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:30,531
When my mother left,
she never came back.

33
00:04:30,564 --> 00:04:32,365
Now, everyone's gone.

34
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:34,534
GUREN (VOICEOVER): Is he
talking about his hometown?

35
00:04:37,136 --> 00:04:40,406
He no longer has any
place to go home to.

36
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:45,478
‐Yukimaru.

37
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,881
GUREN (VOICEOVER):
What have I done?

38
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,482
Forgive me, Yukimaru.

39
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,454
‐Go on, Guren, run.

40
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:21,955
Hurry.

41
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,835
‐Wait, is that‐‐

42
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,302
‐Wait, that's‐‐

43
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,304
‐I have this one now.

44
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,673
‐I don't know.

45
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:40,340
‐Take it.

46
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,376
It's for you, Guren.

47
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,112
‐You want to exchange it, right?

48
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:46,613
OK.

49
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,602
‐This time, I'll hold your hand.

50
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,108
You have to hurry.

51
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:11,612
Guren, run.

52
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:16,678
GUREN (VOICEOVER): And yet,

53
00:06:16,678 --> 00:06:18,619
in spite of all that.

54
00:06:18,652 --> 00:06:23,606
In spite of what I've done,

55
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:27,528
you still care about me.

56
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,405
‐Yukimaru!

57
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,406
‐Here, Guren.

58
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,612
‐Didn't I tell you to stay put?

59
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:48,882
‐Yes, but I was so
worried about you.

60
00:06:48,915 --> 00:06:52,886
I know if I kept you in my
thoughts, you would come back.

61
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,355
GUREN (VOICEOVER): A
place to come back to.

62
00:06:55,388 --> 00:06:56,322
A home.

63
00:06:56,356 --> 00:06:58,692
I stole that from him.

64
00:06:58,725 --> 00:07:02,869
I can't make that right, but
if you'll let me Yukimaru,

65
00:07:02,903 --> 00:07:08,542
if you want me to, then, yes,
I'll be your home from now on.

66
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,518
‐Guren, your little
reunion over with yet?

67
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:18,018
‐Rinji.

68
00:07:22,723 --> 00:07:23,189
‐Yukimaru!

69
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:41,675
We prevented the Leaf from
Sealing the Three Tails.

70
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:45,011
I'm taking Yukimaru
and we're leaving.

71
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:46,913
‐So it was you all along.

72
00:07:46,947 --> 00:07:51,251
‐And what the hell is
that supposed to mean?

73
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:54,187
‐You and I really
should try to get along

74
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,590
for Lord Orochimaru sake.

75
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:58,792
After all, you're the
one who can make Yukimaru

76
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:01,902
use his powers, and
that means you're

77
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:04,571
the one who, in turn,
controls the beast.

78
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:06,540
‐Why have you‐‐
What are you doing?

79
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:13,780
‐Run, Guren.

80
00:08:32,198 --> 00:08:34,134
Guren, are you all right?

81
00:08:38,805 --> 00:08:40,340
‐I‐‐ yes, I'm all right.

82
00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:42,743
‐Thank goodness.

83
00:08:42,776 --> 00:08:45,612
‐'Cuz after all, I
still have this don't I?

84
00:08:45,646 --> 00:08:48,481
‐Um‐huh.

85
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:52,085
And I have this.

86
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:53,453
[groaning]

87
00:08:53,486 --> 00:08:54,621
‐Guren, what is it?

88
00:09:05,138 --> 00:09:07,874
YUKIMARU (VOICEOVER): That was
Mother's grass whistle I just

89
00:09:07,908 --> 00:09:08,842
heard.

90
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:12,613
I finally get to
see the red Camila.

91
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:19,196
[crying]

92
00:09:19,196 --> 00:09:23,519
Mother!

93
00:09:27,994 --> 00:09:29,963
‐Not again.

94
00:09:29,996 --> 00:09:31,965
This can't be happening.

95
00:09:45,478 --> 00:09:45,979
‐Yukimaru.

96
00:09:50,817 --> 00:09:53,453
Yukimaru, Guren
has been too badly

97
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:54,855
hurt to be moved to safety.

98
00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:57,123
It's up to you now to
stop the Three Tails.

99
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:09,075
Yukimaru, if you don't act
quickly Guren is going to die.

100
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,016
[groaning]

101
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,424
‐No.

102
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,926
No.

103
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,062
You're the place I
come home to, Guren.

104
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,697
‐Yes, that's right, Yukimaru.

105
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:33,299
Whenever you see your
beloved Guren in danger,

106
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,835
that's when your
powers fully awaken.

107
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:37,137
Isn't that right?

108
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,773
If you don't stop the
Three Tails, she will die.

109
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:06,773
‐It won't.

110
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:09,776
I won't let it.

111
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,245
I won't let it happen.

112
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:13,246
Not again!

113
00:11:35,135 --> 00:11:36,937
‐That's amazing.

114
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,839
It worked even better
than I thought.

115
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:51,985
‐There's no doubt about it.

116
00:11:52,018 --> 00:11:53,253
That's Yukimaru.

117
00:11:53,286 --> 00:11:55,722
‐Naruto.

118
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,658
‐Kakashi Sensei, where
the hell have you been?

119
00:11:57,691 --> 00:11:58,592
‐What's going on?

120
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,193
What's that beam of light?

121
00:12:00,226 --> 00:12:01,668
‐It's that kid.

122
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:03,436
It's Yukimaru, I'm sure of it.

123
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:06,507
‐You mean that boy who
controls the Three Tails?

124
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,508
‐We've got to help him.

125
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:08,875
What are waiting for?

126
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:11,678
‐No wait.

127
00:12:11,712 --> 00:12:13,079
Change in plans.

128
00:12:13,113 --> 00:12:15,716
Our job now is to protect
that boy and his powers.

129
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:16,817
Let's go with Naruto.

130
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,151
‐Right.

131
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:19,953
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Hang in
there, Yukimaru, I'm coming.

132
00:12:23,256 --> 00:12:24,691
‐Hm.

133
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:28,061
It's like that boy's
controlling the Three Tails.

134
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:28,962
Wait!

135
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:30,130
That's bad.

136
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:32,465
I've got to go tell my superior.

137
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:33,600
Deidara, bad news!

138
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:31,264
RINJI (VOICEOVER): He's
out of chakra already?

139
00:13:31,297 --> 00:13:33,734
Well, what can you
expect from a kid?

140
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:43,644
‐Oh, no.

141
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,088
‐I have to save her.

142
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:07,040
I promise I'll save you Guren.

143
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:36,837
I'm not going to
let you hurt her.

144
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,971
Get out of here.

145
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:41,808
She's given me a home,
a place where I belong.

146
00:14:50,784 --> 00:14:51,251
Guren.

147
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:57,457
‐I won't let you touch this boy.

148
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,925
Just stay behind me.

149
00:14:58,959 --> 00:14:59,860
Do you understand?

150
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:02,268
‐Um‐huh.

151
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,804
‐I have to protect him.

152
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:06,106
Fructify Crystal
Style: Crimson Fruit.

153
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,845
‐Guren.

154
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,914
‐Just stay put now Yukimaru.

155
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:17,250
You'll be safe from
any attacks in there.

156
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,385
Just wait there
until I come back.

157
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,254
‐OK, but be careful.

158
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,723
‐Don't worry about me.

159
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:23,489
I'll be fine.

160
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:30,263
‐Almost there.

161
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,097
Hang on, Yukimaru.

162
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:39,906
GUREN (VOICEOVER):
Whatever I do,

163
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,575
I've got to keep it
away from Yukimaru.

164
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:54,721
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER)I:
This is crazy.

165
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:57,057
We can't just rush
in recklessly.

166
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:57,558
‐Naruto!

167
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,672
‐Yukimaru!

168
00:16:05,706 --> 00:16:06,172
Hey!

169
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:07,107
Yukimaru!

170
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,542
Where are you?

171
00:16:12,378 --> 00:16:14,447
‐Crystal style,
Wild Desert Jetiken.

172
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:14,948
Yah!

173
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:28,862
It's not working.

174
00:16:28,895 --> 00:16:31,364
It's still going after Yukimaru.

175
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:33,166
‐Oh, no, you don't.

176
00:16:38,905 --> 00:16:41,374
GUREN (VOICEOVER): I have to
find some way of stopping it.

177
00:16:41,407 --> 00:16:42,208
‐Don't worry.

178
00:16:42,242 --> 00:16:43,109
I'm fine.

179
00:16:59,526 --> 00:17:00,500
‐I got you!

180
00:17:03,737 --> 00:17:04,838
Try this.

181
00:17:04,871 --> 00:17:07,407
Crystal style, Crystal
Wall Eighth Formation.

182
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:14,280
GUREN (VOICEOVER):
Seems I've reached

183
00:17:14,314 --> 00:17:15,281
the limits of my chakra.

184
00:17:19,586 --> 00:17:21,555
‐That's the Three Tails.

185
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:26,993
It's her.

186
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:33,934
Is that Yukimaru?

187
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:35,335
‐That one again.

188
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:36,803
The Leaf ninja.

189
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:41,207
What?

190
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:46,479
‐No.

191
00:17:46,513 --> 00:17:49,215
I got it.

192
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:51,484
Whoa, that things a lot
bigger than I thought.

193
00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:59,693
‐You stay away from Yukimaru.

194
00:17:59,726 --> 00:18:01,768
‐Lady, I came to
get him out of here.

195
00:18:01,802 --> 00:18:03,169
Sorry.

196
00:18:03,203 --> 00:18:08,408
But before I do that, something
else I've got to take care of.

197
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,598
this is going to be tough.

198
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:33,934
This thing's defenses
are pretty powerful.

199
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:35,902
I don't see a weak
spot anywhere.

200
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:38,204
‐You're just a little
bit stupid, aren't you?

201
00:18:38,238 --> 00:18:38,805
‐Who are you?

202
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:39,506
Shut up.

203
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,874
Who asked you anyway?

204
00:18:40,907 --> 00:18:43,276
‐Did you ever think that
maybe his defenses are strong

205
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:45,345
in order to protect
his weak spot?

206
00:18:59,192 --> 00:19:02,803
‐Ha, that lady's
nothing but talk.

207
00:19:02,836 --> 00:19:04,705
OK.

208
00:19:04,738 --> 00:19:06,339
‐So brief.

209
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:08,274
It's over so soon.

210
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:10,376
Transform my life
force into chakra.

211
00:19:15,315 --> 00:19:17,117
Chakra Points Life and Death.

212
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:21,087
Ahhh!

213
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:34,568
‐She's alive.

214
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:37,103
‐Crystal style, Glow of Light!

215
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:46,112
‐Looks like she was right.

216
00:19:46,146 --> 00:19:48,982
The eye's the weak spot.

217
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:51,451
Here comes my giant Rasangen.

218
00:19:56,923 --> 00:19:58,124
That did the trick.

219
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:23,189
I hate to say it, but I
like your style, lady.

220
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,157
‐Ha.

221
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,458
‐That doesn't mean
you and I still

222
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:26,660
don't have a score to settle.

223
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:31,632
Oh boy.

224
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00,734
‐This must be the boy
Naruto was talking about.

225
00:21:11,745 --> 00:21:12,713
‐We've failed.

226
00:21:12,746 --> 00:21:13,914
A complete disaster.

227
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:19,686
Damn!

228
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,756
But I swear I will
get Yukimaru back.

229
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:34,535
[theme music]

230
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:02,903
‐Where is Yukimaru?

231
00:23:02,936 --> 00:23:05,772
‐We were the only ones
swallowed by the Three Tails,

232
00:23:05,806 --> 00:23:07,641
just you and me.

233
00:23:07,674 --> 00:23:09,242
‐Then he's still by the lake.

234
00:23:09,275 --> 00:23:10,911
‐Unless your people
got to him first,

235
00:23:10,944 --> 00:23:13,279
my friends have taken him
back to the village by now.

236
00:23:13,313 --> 00:23:15,816
‐Well, as soon as I thrash
you and get out of here,

237
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:17,150
I'll take him back.

238
00:23:17,183 --> 00:23:19,319
‐That wouldn't be much of a
fight, not in the condition

239
00:23:19,352 --> 00:23:19,853
you're in.

240
00:23:19,886 --> 00:23:21,021
‐Shut up!

241
00:23:21,054 --> 00:23:24,758
‐Listen, something's
coming this way.

242
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:27,360
Next time, "Strange Bedfellows."
