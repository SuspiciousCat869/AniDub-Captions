{\an4}Listen, guys, since we already
have both of the scrolls we
need, I think we should just go
for the goal.

{\an8}I hear you. I wish
that we could!

12

{\an7}But there's a big risk of
getting ambushed that way.

13
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:08,262
{\an7}We should stick to Sakura's plan
and take the detour, okay?

{\an1}Next, I'm going to teach you
the jutsu to revive all of
the organs, the entire system.

20
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:46,312
{\an1}Ninja Art: Mitotic

{\an1}Ninja Art: Mitotic
Regeneration Jutsu?

22
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:54,122
{\an1}This isn't a jutsu that revolves
around healing skills.

23
00:02:54,156 --> 00:02:58,294
{\an1}It's the same kind of
regeneration jutsu that
the First Hokage used.

24
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:03,467
{\an1}<i>He had such immense amounts of</i>
<i>chakra that he could activate</i>
<i>it without weaving signs.</i>

25
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,873
{\an1}But I don't have that much
chakra! How can I do it?!

26
00:03:07,907 --> 00:03:11,244
{\an1}That is why I have one
other jutsu to teach you.

{\an1}The 100 Healings Jutsu.

{\an1}The 100 Healings Jutsu?

29
00:03:16,752 --> 00:03:22,559
{\an1}Even I don't have as much chakra
as the First Hokage.  And that's
why I developed this jutsu.

30
00:03:22,592 --> 00:03:27,632
{\an1}By using it, you're able
to keep an enormous amount
of chakra in reserve.

00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:34,009

Hm?

35

{\an7}Not only does it require

145
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,943
{\an1}No, I'll deliver it.

146
00:12:48,176 --> 00:12:50,847
{\an1}Really? What brought
this on so suddenly?

147
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,951
Hmph. I'm just
bored, that's all.

148
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:05,700
{\an1}Well, well; I guess
wonders never cease.

149
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:08,003
{\an1}I can't believe you're here.

150
00:13:08,036 --> 00:13:11,608
{\an1}Well, don't worry. I'm leaving
the minute I'm done here.

151
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:14,310
{\an1}Uh, I'm not worried!  Nobody
said they were worried!

152
00:13:14,344 --> 00:13:16,882
{\an1}Anyway, you're late in getting
the medicine here!

153
00:13:20,787 --> 00:13:25,994
<i>(Suigetsu)</i>
<i>[sigh] I'm so disappointed that</i>
<i>you're Orochimaru's lackey.</i>

154
00:13:26,027 --> 00:13:31,935
{\an1}<i>I certainly hope that you aren't</i>
<i>planning  on trying to become</i>
<i>Orochimaru's pet like she is.</i>

155
00:13:31,968 --> 00:13:35,006
Hey, who are you
calling a pet?!

156
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,775
I'm going to get ready
for the experiment!

157
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,580
Sasuke, don't bother
with this loser!

158
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:47,122
{\an1}<i>(Suigetsu)</i>
<i>Sasuke, seriously...</i>
<i>Will you help me?</i>

159
00:13:47,155 --> 00:13:49,958
{\an1}I'm so sick and
tired of this place!

160
00:13:49,991 --> 00:13:53,997
{\an1}Well, it all depends on
how strong you are.

161
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:58,002
<i>(Suigetsu)</i>
<i>Tsk...</i>

162
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,450
{\an1}Hey... huh?

163
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:13,122
[gasp]

164
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,599
{\an1}Just great. What kind
of horrible experiment
is it gonna be this time?

165
00:14:34,651 --> 00:14:36,486
Hey, you...

166
00:14:38,323 --> 00:14:39,858
<i>...what are</i>
<i>you doing!?</i>

167
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:42,561
Lucky me!

168
00:14:47,001 --> 00:14:51,240
{\an1}You let Suigetsu escape?!

169
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:56,013
{\an1}When I came to, everything
was just like you see it.

170
00:14:56,046 --> 00:15:00,920
{\an1}This is bad  If Lord Orochimaru
finds out about this, then he's
gonna take it out on me!

171
00:15:00,953 --> 00:15:03,390
{\an1}We're going after him!
Round everyone up!

172
00:15:03,422 --> 00:15:04,691
{\an1}Right!

173
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:06,526
<i>(Sasuke)</i>
<i>What good will that</i>
<i>do against him?</i>

174
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,832
Sasuke?! What are you
still doing here?!

175
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:14,671
{\an1}I thought it might be
interesting to watch
the experiment.

176
00:15:14,704 --> 00:15:16,506
<i>(Sasuke)</i>
<i>What'll you do?</i>

177
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:18,876
{\an1}What's your plan?

178
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:22,949
Since I'm here I
can lend you a hand.

179
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:30,392
{\an1}That way! Towards
one o'clock!

180
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:32,594
{\an1}Sensory Perception?

181
00:15:32,628 --> 00:15:37,234
{\an1}Yeah, if it's somebody
that I know, I'm able to
track them by their chakra.

182
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:40,405
{\an1}Convenient.  But there's
something I don't understand.

183
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:45,044
{\an1}Since you have a power like
that, I'd think you could
get away from Orochimaru.

184
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:48,416
It's because...

185
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:51,319
{\an1}[crying] Ow! Let go!

186
00:15:52,153 --> 00:15:56,059
{\an1}You know, I'll bet this redhead
is a remnant of a clan from the
Hidden Eddy Village...

187
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:59,063
{\an1}You were right when you said
that she'd be worth something!

188
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:01,266
{\an1}Let me go!
Let me go!

189
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,469
{\an1}<i>[harrumphing chuckle] She's a</i>
<i>pretty feisty for a kid.</i>

190
00:16:03,502 --> 00:16:07,640
{\an1}Hey, little girl, did you
realize that you have a
very unusual power?

191
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:13,515
{\an1}<i>That's right.  And that means</i>
<i>we'll get a good price for you</i>
<i>on the black market. [laugh]</i>

192

[painful grunts]

193
00:16:20,657 --> 00:16:24,497
{\an1}A shinobi without a
homeland is quite tragic.

194
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:29,504
{\an1}<i>No matter where you end up,</i>
<i>you're treated like an outcast. </i>

195
00:16:29,536 --> 00:16:34,043
{\an1}<i>And if you possess</i>
<i>unusual attributes,</i>
<i>they come after you...</i>

196
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,147
{\an1}<i>As long as you're</i>
<i>living, at least.</i>

197
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:43,889
{\an1}And I should know.
I'm speaking as one
of the hunted, too.

198
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:48,228
{\an1}But now... You have a
decision to make.

199
00:16:48,262 --> 00:16:54,403
{\an1}If you decide to come join
me, then nobody will ever
lay a hand on you again.

200
00:16:55,738 --> 00:17:02,046
{\an1}If I have to follow
someone, It has to be
someone strong.

201
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:08,154
{\an1}So if I become stronger than
Orochimaru is, you'd follow
me instead, is that right?

202
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:15,831
<i>(Karin)</i>
<i>Damn, a river! </i>
<i>What a nuisance!</i>

203
00:17:16,899 --> 00:17:22,140
{\an1}We've gotta be careful, Sasuke.
We can't see him right now, but
he's here somewhere.

204
00:17:22,173 --> 00:17:23,808
{\an1}I know.

205
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:32,454
{\an1}Well... I guess I can't
fool you, can I?

206
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:39,263
{\an1}But, I didn't expect
you to be with her.

207
00:17:39,296 --> 00:17:43,235
{\an1}Sasuke follows Lord Orochimaru!
What else did you expect?!

208
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:46,472
Oh, just be quiet!

209
00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:49,910
Hey, Sasuke... If you're
willing to follow her, why
not come with me instead?

210
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,847
{\an7}What?!  What are you talking
about, you big idiot?!

211
00:17:52,881 --> 00:17:55,851
{\an7}I mean, I don't have any reason
to fight with you, Sasuke.

212
00:17:55,885 --> 00:17:57,286
Don't ignore me!

213
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:00,023
{\an1}I already answered
that question back
at the hideout.

214
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,068
{\an1}Oh yeah, that's right. Didn't
you say that it all depends
on my strength?

215
00:18:10,036 --> 00:18:11,572
{\an1}It's a Water Clone!

216
00:18:24,623 --> 00:18:28,227
{\an1}No! Physical attacks
won't work on him!
Use Lightning Style!

217
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:30,864
{\an1}Nope, I won't let
you weave any signs!

{\an1}Aw, I'm so sorry, Sasuke...
Nah, just kidding!

220
00:18:40,977 --> 00:18:44,416

blade you've got!

221
00:18:45,984 --> 00:18:50,056
{\an1}Now then, You're up
next, Karin.

222
00:18:50,891 --> 00:18:53,428
{\an1}Just do what you're
told and come back.

223
00:18:53,461 --> 00:18:56,532
{\an1}Because if you don't,
you're going to regret it.

224
00:18:56,565 --> 00:18:59,402
{\an1}Oh, really? Is that
some kind of threat?

even worked on you.
