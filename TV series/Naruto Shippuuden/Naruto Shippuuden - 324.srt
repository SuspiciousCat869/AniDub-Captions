1
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:50,948
{\an8}Naruto...

2
00:01:52,516 --> 00:01:56,557
{\an1}Please, let all of us deal
with this Madara! I swear
we'll finish him off!

3
00:01:56,591 --> 00:01:58,795
{\an1}It'll be our first step in
stopping the curse of

4
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:01,534
{\an1}hatred we've all been
under until now!

5
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:06,476
{\an1}Like Madara, we Kage are
also guilty of stirring up
hate in the past.

6
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,482
{\an1}It's our responsibility
to make things right!

7
00:02:09,516 --> 00:02:11,786
Rest assured and
leave this to us!

8
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,224
And you...

9
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:17,430
{\an1}You go and take care of the
other Madara, my boy!

10
00:02:17,464 --> 00:02:21,304
{\an1}That act will become the
first step in promoting hope
for the future.

11
00:02:21,337 --> 00:02:23,943
{\an1}The old one or the new one,
it doesn't really matter...

12
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:28,117
{\an1}Only by defeating both
Madaras will we be able to
bring this war to an end!

13
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,390
{\an1}We will all defend you
by fighting on this
battlefield!

14
00:02:31,423 --> 00:02:35,331
{\an1}So protect us through your
actions by fighting over
there on that battlefield!

15
00:02:38,003 --> 00:02:42,678
{\an1}Now, Clone Naruto... I entrust
you with this message from
all the Five Kage.

16
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,016
We'll win!

17
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,567
Yeah!

18
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,407
{\an1}We'll win! For sure!

19
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:15,373
Hey...

20
00:03:24,724 --> 00:03:27,496
Just chill out,
Naruto! Fool, ya fool!

21
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:32,940
{\an1}Damn it, that thing is
really hard! I didn't
even crack it...

22
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:36,012
{\an1}I could've simply passed
through you. But I guess it

23
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:39,352
{\an1}doesn't matter if you
can't even crack the mask.

24
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:42,425
{\an1}That cannot be all
you can manage.

25
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:47,168
{\an1}What about your Nine
Tails power?

26
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:51,508
{\an1}Lava Style: Scorching
Rocks Jutsu!

27
00:03:52,143 --> 00:03:53,112
Whoa, yo!

28
00:04:02,563 --> 00:04:04,867
{\an7}<i>Water Style: Aqua</i>
<i>Mirror Jutsu!</i>

29
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,414
{\an8}<i>These guys...</i>

30
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:14,686
{\an8}<i>...have the same</i>
<i>strength we do!</i>

31
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:19,461
Is this-?

32
00:04:21,732 --> 00:04:24,370
{\an7}<i>This jutsu Is it Utakata?</i>

33
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:35,525
{\an1}Get away from that girl!

34
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,916
{\an8}<i>A Shadow Clone?</i>

35
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:03,611
{\an1}Give it up; you're
coming with me!

36
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:04,848
No!

37
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:07,552
{\an1}He's not your enemy!
He's protecting me!

38
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:08,521
Huh?!

39
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:14,833
{\an1}This chakra I'm sensing...

40
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:19,242
{\an1}Utakata, you were
a Jinchuriki?

41
00:05:20,677 --> 00:05:21,946
You, too, huh?

42
00:05:23,015 --> 00:05:24,952
{\an1}I'd heard some rumors
that you'd gone missing,

43
00:05:24,986 --> 00:05:27,590
{\an1}but I really didn't
know what to believe.

44
00:05:27,624 --> 00:05:29,361
{\an1}So the Akatsuki got you?

45
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:31,331
Yeah...

46
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:35,505
{\an1}After we went our separate
ways I ran into them, laying
in wait for me.

47
00:05:44,756 --> 00:05:48,062
{\an1}This is it, master; this
is the place where I first
met you.

48
00:05:51,502 --> 00:05:54,875
{\an1}Hotaru, will you wait here
for me for a little while?

49
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,180
{\an1}Why, is there a problem?

50
00:05:57,814 --> 00:06:01,788
{\an1}I'm meeting the Anbu Black
Ops. I'm tired of all this
running.

51
00:06:02,222 --> 00:06:05,295
{\an1}I want to get permission
to travel and train you.

52
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:06,898
Great!

53
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:19,255
{\an1}No response. Strange... Did
something happen to them?

54
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:34,951
The Six-Tails'
Jinchuriki Host...

55
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:38,157
{\an1}Are you the ones who killed
Tsurugi and his men?

56
00:06:38,925 --> 00:06:43,200
{\an1}I'm going to build an
entirely new world. And
for that, I need you.

57
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:47,976
{\an1}Well, really, I need the
Tailed Beast that's
inside you.

58
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:49,980
{\an1}So that's it, then...

59
00:06:50,013 --> 00:06:52,551
Now, Six-Tails.
You are mine.

60
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,796
[defiant yell]

61
00:07:16,831 --> 00:07:19,302
{\an1}So you're finally taking
this seriously.

62
00:07:19,836 --> 00:07:23,443
[angry roar]

63
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,283
{\an1}Ah yes, there it is. The
power that we're seeking...

64
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:30,723
[angry roar]

65
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:40,709
Summoning Jutsu!

66
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:45,385
Go!

67
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:04,187
[angry growling]

68
00:08:13,003 --> 00:08:14,974
{\an1}Six Tails is ours.

69
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,120
[defiant roar]

70
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:44,029
[growling]

71
00:08:44,564 --> 00:08:47,670
{\an1}I expected at least this
much of a fight out of you...

72
00:08:50,842 --> 00:08:53,046
[growling]

73
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:55,951
{\an1}Now come to me, Six Tails!

74
00:09:09,878 --> 00:09:10,879
[attacking roar]

75
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,526
[roaring]

76
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,487
Please Hotaru...

77
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:55,130
{\an1}You have to, you have
to live, live...

78
00:11:03,693 --> 00:11:04,896
My master...

79
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,119
{\an1}But why did you do it?

80
00:11:36,723 --> 00:11:38,927
{\an1}Why did you go into the
forest by yourself?!

81
00:11:39,494 --> 00:11:41,532
{\an1}If you'd just escaped
with Hotaru, you'd still be-

82
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,769
{\an1}The Shinobi Tracking Unit
from the village was in

83
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:47,276
{\an1}the forest. And I'd grown
tired of running...

84
00:11:48,345 --> 00:11:52,385
{\an1}I wanted to reconcile
with the village and
finally live in peace.

85
00:11:54,222 --> 00:11:58,497
{\an1}I wanted to stop living like
a fugitive always without a
home.

86
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:04,341
{\an1}And I wanted to spare Hotaru
the pain of living a life
constantly on the run.

87
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,479
{\an1}Utakata! But you--

88
00:12:06,512 --> 00:12:12,891
{\an1}I wonder why I even started
feeling that way. Why did I
wish for a dream like that?

89
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,033
{\an1}I suppose it doesn't matter.
It's all meaningless now.

90
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:40,476
{\an1}I convinced myself that the
master whom I'd once trusted
had betrayed me...

91
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:42,815
And so, I closed
off my heart.

92
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,457
{\an1}I don't know how to trust
people anymore. And yet...

93
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:51,330
{\an1}Hotaru was willing
to put her faith in
someone like me.

94
00:12:51,765 --> 00:12:55,371
{\an1}Hotaru was also burdened
with a fate she hid from
everyone around her.

95
00:12:55,739 --> 00:12:58,177
{\an1}In that way, she was just
like we Jinchuriki are.

96
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,917
{\an1}I don't know, maybe somehow
she sensed that underneath

97
00:13:01,951 --> 00:13:04,355
{\an1}it all, the both of you
were very much alike...

98
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:09,966
Hotaru...

99
00:13:31,206 --> 00:13:34,411
[sobbing]

100
00:13:34,445 --> 00:13:36,249
Hotaru...

101
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:38,187
I never wanted
to hurt anyone.

102
00:13:38,954 --> 00:13:44,698
{\an1}And yet, I hurt Naruto
and Sir Utakata with
my very own hands!

103
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:50,442
{\an1}But look: I'm right here.
Naruto and I are fine!

104
00:13:52,246 --> 00:13:53,782
[sobbing]

105
00:13:59,726 --> 00:14:01,396
I saw it happen...

106
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:03,300
Hotaru...

107
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:08,310
{\an1}I'm sorry... I betrayed
you, Sir Utakata.

108
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:12,450
{\an1}Somebody like me should
just disappear along
with the Jutsu!

109
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,054
Don't say that!

110
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,325
{\an1}I will not allow it!

111
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:20,099
{\an1}A good student should
always listen to her master.

112
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,374
{\an1}Did you say "master"?!

113
00:14:25,743 --> 00:14:26,477
Come on.

114
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:28,714
Let's go.

115
00:14:35,093 --> 00:14:36,429
Thank you.

116
00:14:44,077 --> 00:14:45,314
What is it?!
What's wrong?

117
00:14:45,646 --> 00:14:46,615
No!

118
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:49,220
You must leave!
Sir Utakata...

119
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:52,794
{\an1}Please, just get away
from me! Go, run as
fast as you can!

120
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:54,197
Hotaru!

121
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:59,406
{\an1}I've done all I can; I can't
suppress it any longer... Any
moment, the Forbidden Jutsu

122
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,511
{\an1}is going to tear me
apart and explode.

123
00:15:05,217 --> 00:15:06,454
It's all right.

124
00:15:06,954 --> 00:15:08,724
Sir Utakata...

125
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:10,894
{\an1}Just trust your master.

126
00:15:23,886 --> 00:15:27,693
{\an1}I was like a bubble floating
aimlessly in the wind
before I met Hotaru,

127
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,699
{\an1}but then she showed me
the path to the truth.

128
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:34,739
{\an1}I made up my mind right then
and there that I'd become
Hotaru's master...

129
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:39,215
{\an1}How ironic that just as I
was about to make good on
my decision to start a new

130
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:42,220
{\an1}life, my life was
taken from me.

131
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:45,927
{\an1}Then I was resurrected, only
to discover I have no will

132
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:48,933
{\an1}of my own and am forced
to walk a different path.

133
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:52,541
The ones who are
manipulating you also
used the Akatsuki,

134
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:56,681
{\an1}and right now they're
determined to put the entire
world under their control.

135
00:15:57,216 --> 00:16:00,021
{\an1}Are you just gonna do what
someone like them tells you?

136
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:03,594
{\an1}If you see Hotaru again, you
might be forced to fight her

137
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:06,366
{\an1}without even being able
to say a word to her!

138
00:16:11,075 --> 00:16:14,048
{\an1}Inside, you still possess
the will to take yourself
back!

139
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,152
This fight is
meaningless for you-

140
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:17,321
Naruto...

141
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:22,965
{\an1}I don't know if it's only
because of these strange
circumstances or not, but...

142
00:16:23,665 --> 00:16:27,273
{\an1}I just shared my true
feelings with you. Thank
you for listening...

143
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:34,887
Naruto!

144
00:16:36,924 --> 00:16:39,028
{\an1}Water Style: Bubble Jutsu!

145
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,076
{\an1}Close one. Thanks
a lot, Octopops!

146
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,014
Huh?

147
00:16:50,783 --> 00:16:54,257
Secret Ninjutsu!
Scaled Sneak Jutsu!

148
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:14,462
{\an1}Yo, my shades are the best.
Light, with my eyes, don't
mess!

149
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,602
{\an1}I can still see their evil
intent, too. This'll be
easy!

150
00:17:21,075 --> 00:17:25,416
{\an1}Yugito's here, too. Seems
these guys are all former
Jinchuriki.

151
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:30,959
{\an1}On top of that, each of them
has a Sharingan in one eye
and a Rinnegan in the other...

152
00:17:31,662 --> 00:17:35,569
{\an4}They were robbed of their
lives, turned into pawns,
and then had those

153
00:17:35,602 --> 00:17:39,677
{\an1}disgusting things implanted
into them. Poor Yugito.

154
00:17:40,746 --> 00:17:42,482
{\an1}If things had gone
differently, you may

155
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:45,988
{\an1}have ended up like
that, too. For real!

156
00:17:46,322 --> 00:17:49,795
{\an1}To see them all like that
fills me with rage and
grief. But me not getting

157
00:17:49,828 --> 00:17:51,999
{\an1}eyes like that is still
a big relief...

158
00:17:52,033 --> 00:17:54,505
{\an1}Your shades would hide them,
anyway. But if you don't

159
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:57,511
{\an1}want to end up like that,
don't let your guard down!

160
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,449
{\an1}Madara's eyes are the
exact same as that, too.

161
00:18:00,482 --> 00:18:04,122
{\an1}His new mask has got two
holes, not just one like
before.

162
00:18:04,991 --> 00:18:08,898
{\an1}That's not the only
difference. I had to
custom make this mask.

163
00:18:08,931 --> 00:18:10,769
{\an1}It's battle grade tough.

164
00:18:11,303 --> 00:18:15,177
{\an1}So the left eye that you
always kept hidden was a
Rinnegan just like the ones

165
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,249
{\an1}belonging to Nagato and
to the other Madara.

166
00:18:19,485 --> 00:18:23,158
{\an1}We'll stop both of
you Madaras. You can
count on that!

167
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,766
{\an1}Did you just say "both?"

168
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:32,008
Summoning Jutsu:
Reanimation.

169
00:18:44,065 --> 00:18:45,602
Th- That's-!

170
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:50,677
{\an1}Surely you didn't think that
I'd come unprepared to a
meeting with you?

171
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:54,050
{\an1}See? You cannot refuse me.

172
00:18:54,451 --> 00:18:57,991
Why you-- Where
did you get that?

173
00:18:58,392 --> 00:19:00,228
{\an1}Oh, I have my needs...

174
00:19:00,262 --> 00:19:04,303
{\an1}But don't worry, I haven't
told anyone else about this.

175
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,951
{\an1}Damn that Kabuto...

176
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,124
{\an1}What're you talking about,
"both," Naruto, ya fool?

177
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:17,896
{\an1}That's Madara right over
there, ain't it, fool ya
fool?

178
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,601
[chuckling]

179
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,310
{\an1}You can call me by my
past name, Tobi.

180
00:19:25,343 --> 00:19:29,518
{\an1}Now that the war has begun,
names are irrelevant.

181
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:34,025
{\an1}Madara... Tobi... Call
me whatever you wish.

182
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:36,664
Who are you?

183
00:19:37,165 --> 00:19:39,369
{\an1}Just tell us, who
are you, really?

184
00:19:39,871 --> 00:19:45,883
{\an1}Nobody. I don't want to be
anybody. I just want to
fulfill Project Tsuki no Me.

185
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,552
{\an1}That will be enough.

186
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:53,229
{\an1}It is not worth living in
this world where only
despair exists.

187
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:59,608
{\an1}You Jinchuriki had Tailed
Beasts forced upon you.

188
00:19:59,642 --> 00:20:02,179
{\an1}All you've ever experienced
is despair...

189
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:08,157
{\an1}Am I wrong? Surely, you
ought to understand my
despair, at least a little...

190
00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:12,265
{\an1}And just who the hell
are you to decide...

191
00:20:15,103 --> 00:20:18,945
{\an1}...that having a Tailed Beast
makes me feel despair like
that?!

192
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:29,699
{\an1}Even if you think that
this world is worthless.

193
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:33,072
{\an1}Do you seriously think that
you can get away with
starting a war like this

194
00:20:33,104 --> 00:20:36,678
{\an1}and then just come along
and try to play that
you're nobody?

195
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:41,687
You piss me off...

196
00:20:43,123 --> 00:20:46,262
{\an1}I'm going to tear that
mask right off your face!

197
00:20:46,564 --> 00:20:49,135
Sounds good, but
me first! Yeah!

198
00:20:50,537 --> 00:20:52,809
{\an1}Try to remove this mask...

199
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:01,893
...you'll end up
broken to pieces!

200
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:07,436
[confused gasp]

201
00:21:10,308 --> 00:21:13,983
Eight Tails...
Nine Tails...

202
00:21:14,382 --> 00:21:21,898
{\an1}You shall be mine and then
I will achieve Project Tsuki
no Me!

203
00:22:57,511 --> 00:23:01,253
{\an1}<i>What's going on? I thought</i>
<i>that their Tailed Beasts</i>
<i>were extracted from them!</i>

204
00:23:01,286 --> 00:23:03,222
{\an1}<i>I can only assume that</i>
<i>they were made back</i>

205
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,928
{\an1}<i>into Jinchuriki after</i>
<i>they were reanimated...</i>

206
00:23:05,961 --> 00:23:09,467
{\an1}<i>This is just like the</i>
<i>time that I fought the</i>
<i>Six Paths of Pain.</i>

207
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:14,076
{\an1}<i>It's the Rinnegan! Their</i>
<i>eyes are linked, hooked</i>
<i>up to each other!</i>

208
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,652
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Jinchuriki</i>
<i>vs. Jinchuriki!"</i>

209
00:23:19,153 --> 00:23:21,456
{\an1}<i>It's like Nagato's</i>
<i>Gedo Jutsu!</i>
