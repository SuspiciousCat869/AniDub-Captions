Eh?

110
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:35,088
{\an4}But there are others who put
their lives at risk, fought for
the village, and even saved
their comrades...

111
00:09:35,188 --> 00:09:40,552
{\an1}Yet they weren't given a heroes'
burial or even buried in an
ordinary grave.

112
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:47,582
{\an1}So what's the story about this
person, Sensei?  Why weren't
they put with the others?

113
00:09:47,682 --> 00:09:50,580
{\an1}He was a captain on a difficult
top-secret mission.

114
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,077
{\an1}While in enemy territory,
he faced a difficult choice:

115
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:57,741
{\an1}continue the mission or save
the lives of his men.

116
00:09:57,841 --> 00:09:59,575
{\an1}And which one did he choose?

117
00:09:59,675 --> 00:10:01,940
It must've been his
comrades' lives, right?

118
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,405
{\an1}To save their lives... he
cancelled the mission.

119
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:07,970
I knew it!

120
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,935
{\an1}However, the village suffered
huge losses as a result.

121
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:15,233
{\an1}He was held responsible and
blamed for his actions...

122
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:19,696
{\an1}In the end, even the
shinobi whose lives he
saved denounced him.

123
00:10:19,796 --> 00:10:24,295
{\an1}He was deeply hurt, and it
took its toll mentally and
physically.

124
00:10:24,395 --> 00:10:26,093
{\an1}Until he took his
own life.

125
00:10:26,194 --> 00:10:27,926
But, that's--!

126
00:10:29,758 --> 00:10:33,123
{\an1}Why?!  I mean, yeah, he broke
the ninja code, but he did it to
save the lives of his own men!

127
00:10:33,223 --> 00:10:39,587
{\an7}One of the very first things
that we learn at the Academy is
that under shinobi rules, the
mission takes priority.

128
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:41,019
Yeah, but...

129
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:45,416
{\an1}In the shinobi world,
those who break the rules
are scum. That's true...

130
00:10:45,516 --> 00:10:47,781
{\an1}But, that's not--

131
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:54,145
{\an1}However! Those who'd sacrifice
even one of their comrades...
are worse than scum.

132
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:56,277
Hm?

133
00:10:57,676 --> 00:11:03,040
{\an4}Anyway!  Until you get the
signal to assemble for the
mission, you guys should go do
some training!

134
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,671
{\an1}Dismissed!
-Right!
-Uh, right!

135
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:10,336
{\an1}Hm? Something wrong?

136
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:15,100
{\an1}Tell me, Sensei. Why was I put
on the same team as Naruto?

137
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,633
{\an1}You have a problem with it?

138
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:19,265
{\an1}No, I don't.  Not exactly.

139
00:11:19,365 --> 00:11:22,630
{\an1}But if he's on a team where
there's too large a difference
in skill levels

140
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:25,394
{\an1}then I'm sure he's gonna
suffer because of that.

141
00:11:25,494 --> 00:11:28,059
{\an1}You were the Academy's most
promising student.

142
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,991
{\an1}Are you blaming Naruto for
S-ranked missions not coming
your way?

143
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,656
{\an1}Because it seems like it...

No. I didn't mean
it that way...

145
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:38,820
{\an1}Because it could be
just the opposite.

146

today's the day we get an

Yes! I'm going
all out!

can be so positive about life
all the time?

149
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,475
{\an1}Well, remember, Sakura, I'm
gonna be the Hokage someday!

150
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:03,640
{\an1}So for the sake of the village,
I can't be a downer!

Fourth Hokage.

159

even a loser could follow in
the Hokage's footsteps.
