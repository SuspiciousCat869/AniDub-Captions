another life-threatening
situation like before.

145
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,396
So I'll teach you ninjutsu,
but only for self defense.

Nagato, what's bothering you?

Talk to me.

165
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:26,530
-Sensei.

166
00:11:26,563 --> 00:11:29,330
-Is it that incident?

167
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:33,630
-That day when that
ninja hurt Yahiko,

168
00:11:33,663 --> 00:11:36,630
I was just so angry with him.

169
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,896
Everything went
blank in my head.

170
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,963
I didn't know what I was doing.

171
00:11:41,996 --> 00:11:45,496
Before I realized
it, the guy was dead.

172
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,663
After that, just
became so frightened.

173
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:52,163
That hatred made me
go blind with rage.

174
00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:55,096
And I killed somebody
because of it.

175
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:55,930
It was wrong.

176
00:11:55,963 --> 00:11:57,130
I know it was wrong.

177
00:11:57,163 --> 00:12:01,263
-Nagato, I don't know.

178
00:12:01,296 --> 00:12:03,530
I can't really say whether
what you did was right

179
00:12:03,563 --> 00:12:04,863
or it was wrong.

180
00:12:04,896 --> 00:12:08,763
But still, thanks to your
actions, Yahiko is still alive.

181
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,363
You saved your friend.

182
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,630
So I believe that's always
the right thing to do.

183
00:12:13,663 --> 00:12:17,330
No one can fault you
for helping a friend.

184
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:19,696
Once you've been hurt,
you learn to hate.

185
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,396
But if you hurt another
you become hated,

186
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,363
and you shoulder
a sense of guilt.

187
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:28,396
But it is because one
understands such pain

188
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,996
that generosity towards
others becomes second nature.

189
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,330
That's what makes us human.

190

-I don't-- what do you mean?

191
00:12:38,063 --> 00:12:41,530
-It's a process
called growing up.

192
00:12:41,563 --> 00:12:43,263
-It's called growing up?

193
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,363
I still don't get it.

194
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:48,396
-It's about being able to think
and make your own decisions.

195
00:12:53,196 --> 00:12:56,263
-Konan and I would cry
because we were so hungry.

196
00:12:56,296 --> 00:12:59,263
And then Yahiko saved us.

197
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:04,530
He stole food from
other people to feed us.

198

might be a way to stop it.

to never give up
was pretty awesome.

322
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:16,908
He's actually quite a
lot like you, sensei.

323
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:17,641
-Yeah?

324
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,308
You think so?

325
00:20:19,341 --> 00:20:21,841
-So I was thinking.

326
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,875
I really hope my soon-to-be-born
child can become an amazing

327
00:20:24,908 --> 00:20:27,908
shinobi, just like the main
character in your book.

328
00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:29,975
So that's why I'd like
to ask your permission

329
00:20:30,008 --> 00:20:33,275
to name my son after him.

330
00:20:33,308 --> 00:20:34,575
-You what?

331
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,308
Are you sure about this?

332
00:20:36,341 --> 00:20:38,875
I mean, I randomly came up
with it while eating ramen.

333
00:20:38,908 --> 00:20:39,875
KUSHINA UZUMAKI: Naruto.

334
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,575
I think it's a wonderful name.

335
00:20:48,241 --> 00:20:48,708
-Kushina.

336
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:53,841
Wow.

337
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,508
So would that make me
his godfather then?

338
00:20:56,541 --> 00:21:00,208
Are you really sure
you're sure about this?

339
00:21:00,241 --> 00:21:02,808
-You are my sensei, Jiraiya.

340
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:05,675
You are a great ninja who
possesses true talent.

341
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,675
There's no one else like
you in the whole world.

342
00:21:11,341 --> 00:21:13,108
NARRATOR: Even
after that moment,

343
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:17,075
Jiraiya continued his journeys
in search of his destiny.

344
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:19,608
So it would be some
time before Jiraiya

345
00:21:19,641 --> 00:21:23,375
would meet Naruto in the
Village Hidden in the Leafs

346
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:25,441
and begin their
journey together.

347
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,970
[music playing]

348
00:23:02,332 --> 00:23:04,765
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
What is going on here?

349
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,465
It's great that I got
in here so easily,

350
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:10,532
but just who is this Pain that
everybody's talking about?

351
00:23:10,565 --> 00:23:12,032
All I ever get from
these villagers

352
00:23:12,065 --> 00:23:16,099
are vague descriptions
like god or angel.

353
00:23:16,132 --> 00:23:18,765
And I can't seem to
locate the former village

354
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,265
leader, Hanzo of the Salamander.

355
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,899
But there's no time to waste.

356
00:23:22,932 --> 00:23:26,432
I guess that I'll have to
just go with that one plan.

357
00:23:26,465 --> 00:23:27,965
Next time-- Infiltrate!

358
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:30,532
The Village Hidden in the Rain.
