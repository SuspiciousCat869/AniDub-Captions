1
00:00:08,787 --> 00:00:13,225
{\an8}<i>(crowd cheering)</i>

2
00:00:13,258 --> 00:00:19,630
{\an4}<i>We've stopped the Hidden</i>
<i>Stone's deplorable schemes!</i>
<i>Now our village is one step</i>
<i>closer to victory!</i>

3
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:25,268
{\an4}We have only one
person to thank for the
successful completion
of this mission.

4
00:00:28,804 --> 00:00:33,142
{\an1}<i>The hero of the Hidden</i>
<i>Sand, Pakura of the</i>
<i>Scorch Style!</i>

5
00:00:33,175 --> 00:00:35,711
(crowd cheering)

6
00:00:40,616 --> 00:00:41,883
{\an1}<i>Sensei!</i>

7
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:46,788
{\an1}Yes, Maki? What
do you need?

8
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,855
Please, I want
you to train me!

9
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:51,391
{\an1}I just finished a
very demanding
mission.

10
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:54,894
{\an1}Sensei, you- even
you get tired?

11
00:00:54,927 --> 00:00:55,662
(surprised gasp)

12
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:58,564
{\an1}Oh, honestly,
Maki!

13
00:01:08,773 --> 00:01:10,040
{\an1}Ahhhhh!

14
00:01:16,913 --> 00:01:18,482
{\an7}<i>A diversion?</i>

15
00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:19,315
(surprised gasp)

16
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,188
Aww! So close!

17
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:30,792
{\an4}No, you did well.
A trick like that
would have caught
anyone else.

18
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:32,761
Please, just
one more time!

19
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:37,298
{\an4}Don't be hasty.
I'm sure you'll
become stronger
in time.

20
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:39,467
<i>You really think so?</i>

21
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:45,505
{\an7}The reason you want to
get stronger is so you
can get revenge, isn't
it?

22
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:49,942
{\an1}Yes! For my father!
A Hidden Mist shinobi
killed him.

23
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:52,811
{\an7}That's good. Because
those feelings will
make you stronger!

24
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:53,945
(gasp)

25
00:01:55,714 --> 00:01:59,650
{\an7}The strong emotions
you possess for your
family, for your friends,
for your home, and your

26
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:01,586
{\an7}desire to defend
your village...

27
00:02:02,453 --> 00:02:04,988
{\an1}Those emotions make
a shinobi strong.

28
00:02:06,223 --> 00:02:07,357
{\an1}Right!

29
00:02:09,626 --> 00:02:15,297
{\an4}<i>Now then, it's time to</i>
<i>discuss our negotiations</i>
<i>for a truce with the</i>
<i>Hidden Mist.</i>

30
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:19,568
{\an5}<i>They still seem to</i>
<i>hold a deep-seated</i>
<i>grudge against our</i>
<i>village. Even though</i>

31
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:23,671
{\an5}<i>we made a proposal</i>
<i>that is ridiculously</i>
<i>in their favor, they</i>
<i>refused to budge or</i>

32
00:02:23,705 --> 00:02:25,340
<i>even consider it!</i>

33
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:29,410
{\an7}<i>I say that it's time</i>
<i>for a showdown with</i>
<i>the Hidden Stone! We</i>
<i>shouldn't worry so much</i>

34
00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:31,779
{\an7}<i>about what might be!</i>

35
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:36,616
{\an8}<i>I guess we have no</i>
<i>choice. We'll need to</i>
<i>make use of Pakura again,</i>
<i>for the sake of the village.</i>

36
00:02:40,553 --> 00:02:46,825
{\an4}<i>Our hero, Pakura of</i>
<i>the Scorch Style has</i>
<i>died. But she never</i>
<i>gave up! She fought</i>

37
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:51,095
{\an1}<i>until the very end!</i>
<i>We shall not let her</i>
<i>death be in vain!</i>

38
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:59,002
{\an4}<i>She died for the village,</i>
<i>for all of us! So we must</i>
<i>carry on her will and destroy</i>
<i>the Hidden Stone Village!</i>

39
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:01,271
{\an8}<i>(crowd cheering)</i>

40
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,642
<i>Pakura Sensei...</i>

41
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,938
{\an1}Ninja Art!
Needle Senbon!

42
00:05:10,951 --> 00:05:13,118
{\an1}You're all weaklings!

43
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,987
Captain Monga!

44
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:19,257
{\an7}Just hold tight. I
don't want you to do
anything until we get a
handle on the situation.

45
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,759
{\an1}<i>Captain Monga!</i>

46
00:05:22,327 --> 00:05:25,496
{\an4}The enemy is now using
guerilla tactics instead
of engaging us in large
squads.

47
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:28,499
{\an1}<i>And we're facing the</i>
<i>Seven Ninja Swords</i>
<i>Men of the Mist.</i>

48
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:34,737
{\an1}<i>He's mummified!</i>

49
00:05:36,372 --> 00:05:40,009
{\an8}<i>I wonder if she's out</i>
<i>there, too. Fighting</i>
<i>against us again.</i>

50
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:42,744
{\an1}<i>We don't know where</i>
<i>the enemy will appear!</i>

51
00:05:43,378 --> 00:05:45,246
{\an1}So don't let your
guard down!

52
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,149
<i>Captain! We should</i>
<i>go search for the</i>
<i>enemy!</i>

53
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:53,387
{\an4}Our orders are to contain
the battle and wait here
until we receive commands
from the front lines.

54
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:55,555
{\an1}But still! There must
be something we can do!

55
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:59,526
{\an7}The sealing, medical,
and intel teams are
needed on the
battlefield. Our

56
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,928
{\an7}mission is to make
sure they stay safe!

57
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,496
{\an8}<i>We can't put ourselves</i>
<i>in unnecessary danger.</i>

58
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,001
{\an4}He's right. The only
people who are really
able to stop the
reanimated shinobi

59
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:10,535
{\an1}are those in the
Sealing Corps.

60
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:13,605
That may be true,
Ruka, but you and
the Medical Corps...

61
00:06:13,638 --> 00:06:17,709
{\an7}Don't you worry! As
long as I'm here, they
won't be able to lay
a finger on you!

62
00:06:18,241 --> 00:06:20,577
{\an7}I'll risk my life
to protect you.

63
00:06:20,944 --> 00:06:22,679
Captain...

64
00:06:22,713 --> 00:06:26,984
{\an4}It's all right. If
my Captain's ever in
danger, I'd risk my life
to save him, as well.

65
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:29,285
{\an1}<i>I got it, I got it.</i>

66
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,360
{\an1}Man, he's strong even
without a ninja blade!

67
00:06:38,393 --> 00:06:42,830
{\an5}Yeah, but there's only
one of him. If we can
just surround him and
attack in waves, that

68
00:06:42,864 --> 00:06:45,232
should create an
opportunity for us
to win this.

69
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:50,136
{\an1}It seems like a
tough fight.

70
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:53,006
I'm sure it is
considering who
they're up against.

71
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,210
{\an5}Maki, tell me. Why
do you think the enemy
isn't just attacking
us with large force?

72
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:03,280
{\an4}<i>I don't know, but we need</i>
<i>to figure out the enemy's</i>
<i>strategy and put together</i>
<i>a way to counter it.</i>

73
00:07:05,683 --> 00:07:07,585
Huh? Ahhhh!

74
00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:08,753
(gasp)

75
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:15,358
{\an1}How many enemy's
are there?

76
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:18,260
I'm not sure! They
just suddenly appeared!

77
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:21,031
{\an1}Maki, Ruka! I need
you both to fall back!

78
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:23,866
{\an1}You should tell them
to run fast, too.

79
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,402
{\an1}Because if they don't,
then they'll go boom.

80
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:29,071
Gari, of the
Explosion Style!

81
00:07:29,104 --> 00:07:31,773
{\an1}I never expected
to face you, Gari.

82
00:07:31,806 --> 00:07:36,510
{\an5}<i>Yeah, that's clear.</i>
<i>You don't have anywhere</i>
<i>near enough men to take</i>
<i>me on.</i>

83
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:41,347
{\an1}You fools. You've
done exactly what
we wanted!

84
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,284
{\an7}<i>I see! Their guerrilla</i>
<i>tactics are just to</i>
<i>scatter our forces!</i>

85
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:50,221
{\an5}<i>You've been targeting</i>
<i>the support squads in</i>
<i>the rear from the</i>
<i>start, huh?</i>

86
00:07:50,255 --> 00:07:53,892
{\an4}Well, after all,
that's the quickest
way to end the battle,
isn't it?

87
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:58,262
{\an4}And besides, I've
just been brought back
to life! I can't stand
the thought of becoming

88
00:07:58,295 --> 00:08:01,865
{\an1}immobile again because
of some foolish Sealing
Jutsu!

89
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:06,502
{\an5}I never thought that
someone like you would
be satisfied with being
a mere puppet.

90
00:08:06,536 --> 00:08:10,707
{\an4}Yeah, well, you've never
been dead before, have
you? So there's no way
that you could possibly

91
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,808
{\an1}understand.

92
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:14,810
{\an1}Why, you! Death isn't
something to be taken
lightly!

93
00:08:14,843 --> 00:08:17,345
{\an1}Earth Style! Earth
and Stone Shoots!

94
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,182
{\an1}<i>Careful!</i>

95
00:08:20,214 --> 00:08:21,315
{\an1}Don't get near him!

96
00:08:27,688 --> 00:08:33,126
{\an4}So sorry, but it
seems that your
advice has fallen
on deaf ears!

97
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,828
{\an1}<i>Captain Monga, I-</i>

98
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:36,628
{\an1}<i>You two stay back!</i>

99
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:40,365
{\an1}<i>I can handle</i>
<i>this myself.</i>

100
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,603
{\an1}How fun! It's a pity
you can't stop me
with only confidence!

101
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:51,776
{\an1}You think that'll
protect you from
my Explosion Style?!

102
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,963
You did it,
Captain Monga!
Excellent job!

103
00:09:14,996 --> 00:09:16,430
{\an1}Yeah...

104
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,465
{\an1}But we're not done.

105
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:23,402
{\an1}Maki, seal him
away immediately.

106
00:09:24,704 --> 00:09:25,972
(painful scream)

107
00:09:27,673 --> 00:09:28,708
{\an1}<i>Captain!</i>

108
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:31,710
{\an7}<i>This jutsu!</i>

109
00:09:41,418 --> 00:09:42,887
{\an1}<i>Pakura Sensei!</i>

110
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,205
{\an1}Pakura Sensei!

111
00:10:04,273 --> 00:10:06,140
{\an1}Wait, are you...

112
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:07,909
{\an1}...Maki?

113
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,979
I never, I never
expected to see you
again, not this way.

114
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,183
{\an1}Your face paint
hasn't' changed
a bit.

115
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,286
{\an7}Hey, Maki, what do
you mean, Sensei?

116
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:25,790
{\an5}She was once a great
hero of the Hidden
Sand. And also, she's
the person who trained

117
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:27,325
me to become a
shinobi.

118
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:31,662
{\an1}My, my. Coming back
to life has been
full of surprises.

119
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:36,767
{\an7}Why are you fighting
against us, Sensei? Are
you not able to move
of your own free will?

120
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,537
{\an1}To vent my anger at
being banished to
death and silence!

121
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:43,773
<i>To vent your anger?</i>

122
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:51,413
{\an5}I was made into the
village hero. And yet
after all that praise,
I was sacrificed as a

123
00:10:51,446 --> 00:10:54,082
lowly pawn for
the benefit of
the village.

124
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:56,218
My anger and
frustration.

125
00:10:57,518 --> 00:11:03,157
{\an4}<i>The ones who used me</i>
<i>may be long gone, but</i>
<i>the village that killed</i>
<i>me still exists and</i>

126
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,792
{\an1}<i>is a painful reminder</i>
<i>of what was done to me!</i>

127
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,562
{\an7}That's right! The
reason that I'm
fighting is to
finally eradicate

128
00:11:10,596 --> 00:11:12,232
{\an7}the Village Hidden
in the Mist!

129
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,399
{\an1}The Hidden Mist Village?

130
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,403
{\an4}But I had always been
told that you died
fighting against shinobi
of the Hidden Stone.

131
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:24,041
{\an4}That was just a story
made up by our superiors
so they could use my
death to the advantage

132
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:25,209
{\an1}of our village.

133
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,314
{\an1}<i>That day, I realized the</i>
<i>truth about everything</i>
<i>just before I died...</i>

134
00:11:33,515 --> 00:11:38,654
{\an4}<i>The Kazekage ordered</i>
<i>me to travel to the</i>
<i>Hidden Mist Village to</i>
<i>act as an ambassador.</i>

135
00:11:39,654 --> 00:11:43,424
{\an1}<i>It was a top-secret</i>
<i>mission, so I left</i>
<i>in secret.</i>

136
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:49,230
{\an1}<i>Lady Pakura of</i>
<i>the Scorch Style!</i>

137
00:11:50,564 --> 00:11:52,466
{\an1}I've been sent out
here to welcome you.

138
00:11:53,033 --> 00:11:55,168
{\an1}It's truly an
honor to meet
you.

139
00:11:57,304 --> 00:12:01,406
{\an4}Because this thick mist
enshrouds us, we thought
someone should come guide
you.

140
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:03,109
Thank you, very much.

141
00:12:03,142 --> 00:12:06,811
{\an5}But there's no way I
could get lost going
through a valley like
this one.

142
00:12:06,845 --> 00:12:10,315
{\an1}Hah, very true!
Well then, please
after you.

143
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:11,849
<i>Thank you.</i>

144
00:12:14,185 --> 00:12:14,985
(painful grunt)

145
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:21,591
{\an1}What are you
doing?

146
00:12:21,624 --> 00:12:24,727
{\an8}<i>Showing you the same</i>
<i>pain felt by my</i>
<i>comrades...</i>

147
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:27,096
{\an8}<i>...when your village</i>
<i>killed them!</i>

148
00:12:40,207 --> 00:12:44,878
{\an4}Now, don't get the
wrong idea. Don't think
this will even begin to
get rid of our grudge

149
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:45,812
{\an1}against you.

150
00:12:46,947 --> 00:12:50,883
{\an1}<i>But at least your</i>
<i>sacrifice...will</i>
<i>be a small comfort.</i>

151
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:54,753
{\an5}The ones from the
Hidden Sand who
betrayed you to us
are probably thinking

152
00:12:54,787 --> 00:12:56,388
that same thing.

153
00:13:00,725 --> 00:13:04,594
{\an5}I was used as a
bargaining chip with
the Village Hidden
in the Mist...

154
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:07,597
...sacrificed for
the benefit of
our village.

155
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:09,599
That can't be...

156
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,301
{\an1}Horrible...

157
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:17,707
{\an4}From what I can see,
one of them appears
to have slipped into
your ranks.

158
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:20,142
A Shinobi from
the Blood Mist.

159
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:24,946
{\an4}But all of that was
in the past! The Fifth
Mizukage has ushered
in a whole new age of

160
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,115
{\an1}peace and diplomacy
for the Hidden Mist!

161
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:32,486
{\an4}Do you really think
that erases the past?!
The Hidden Mist's history
of blood and treachery?!

162
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,687
{\an7}Please stop this,
Pakura Sensei!

163
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:39,826
{\an4}If you want to hate,
then pin your hatred
on our village for
betraying your trust!

164
00:13:39,859 --> 00:13:42,095
{\an1}If anything, you
should blame the
Hidden Sand

165
00:13:42,128 --> 00:13:45,198
<i>for casting aside</i>
<i>a hero as loyal as</i>
<i>you were!</i>

166
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:52,536
{\an4}Honestly, I find
myself conflicted by
your story. But
regardless of that...

167
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:57,908
{\an7}I strongly believe that
it's wrong to attack
these people, who have
absolutely nothing to

168
00:13:57,942 --> 00:14:00,577
{\an7}do with whatever grudge
you might be holding
onto now!

169
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,945
{\an1}<i>They are involved!</i>

170
00:14:01,978 --> 00:14:05,081
And that's because
you won't let yourself
see the truth, Sensei!

171
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:09,218
{\an7}I've learned something
fighting in the Shinobi
Alliance.

172
00:14:09,486 --> 00:14:13,688
{\an7}Even people who are
extremely prejudiced
against other villages
and the people who are

173
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:18,559
{\an7}from them, can still
find a way to work
together and to talk
together, to understand

174
00:14:18,593 --> 00:14:21,029
{\an7}each other and to
endeavor for the
common good of all.

175
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,365
{\an1}If that's true...

176
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:29,735
{\an8}If that's true, then
who can get rid of this
grudge that festers deep
inside of my heart?!

177
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:33,539
{\an4}Are you telling me
that it couldn't be
helped?! That I
should just give up?!

178
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,875
{\an1}Well, no...

179
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:41,413
{\an4}Enough of this chatter!
Besides, I've been
reanimated, I couldn't
go against my orders

180
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,748
{\an1}to fight the Allied
Shinobi Forces even
if I wanted to!

181
00:14:44,782 --> 00:14:48,520
{\an5}Listen, the two of
you go on, get out
of here! But I'll
need the transmitter!

182
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:50,954
{\an1}No, you just leave
all this to me!

183
00:14:50,988 --> 00:14:52,655
{\an1}Hidden Cloth Jutsu!

184
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,630
{\an1}That was a nice move!
But I wonder how far
you can run away!

185
00:15:05,801 --> 00:15:10,238
{\an7}We can't defeat her
in a straightforward
fight. We have to rejoin
the rest of the team.

186
00:15:10,272 --> 00:15:11,806
{\an1}<i>I'll try to</i>
<i>contact them.</i>

187
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,817
You saved us, Ruka.

188
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:27,554
{\an1}My Water Style is
pretty good, isn't
it?

189
00:15:27,586 --> 00:15:30,522
{\an1}I'm sorry that I've
been so useless to
you in this battle.

190
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:32,023
<i>So this is where</i>
<i>you were...</i>

191
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,024
(gasps)

192
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,862
{\an4}You've shown you can't
fight me, and now it
looks like you can't
run away from me either.

193
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:42,365
{\an5}<i>So what'll it be?</i>
<i>Are we going to</i>
<i>continue our game</i>
<i>of hide and seek?</i>

194
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:47,104
{\an1}Sensei, please, just
hear me out for a
minute first.

195
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:52,274
{\an4}You can't change the
past, but you can make
the choice to help
create the future.

196
00:15:54,742 --> 00:16:00,315
{\an7}I believe our experiences,
fighting together in the
Allied Shinobi Forces will
change the relationships

197
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:01,682
{\an7}between the villages.

198
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:07,154
{\an7}And because of that,
we'll have a new shinobi
world that won't make
the same mistakes.

199
00:16:08,055 --> 00:16:13,459
{\an7}You choose, Pakura
Sensei. When you died,
you were a hero of the
Hidden Sand.

200
00:16:14,193 --> 00:16:16,828
{\an1}Please remain a
hero! I beg you!

201
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:23,435
(gasp)

202
00:16:27,838 --> 00:16:30,207
Wow, this sure is
one flashy fight.

203
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:31,408
{\an1}<i>Zaji, Omoi!</i>

204
00:16:31,442 --> 00:16:33,444
{\an1}I'm sorry we took
so long to get here.

205
00:16:33,477 --> 00:16:36,012
{\an1}But we ran into a
little trouble back
there.

206
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,049
{\an1}Do it now!

207
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:47,022
Did we get him?

208
00:16:51,926 --> 00:16:54,996
It seems our enemy
possesses Kekkei
Genkai.

209
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:57,664
{\an1}<i>If that fireball hits</i>
<i>you, it's all over.</i>

210
00:16:58,031 --> 00:17:00,534
{\an1}Don't worry. We'll
cover the two of you!

211
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:02,402
{\an1}Good. We're
counting on you.

212
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,541
{\an1}(attacking grunts)

213
00:17:08,741 --> 00:17:09,842
{\an1}(attacking growl)

214
00:17:10,342 --> 00:17:10,975
{\an3}Ruka!

215
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:11,644
{\an1}Right!

216
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:14,513
{\an1}Gotcha!

217
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:15,246
{\an1}Huh?

218
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:19,716
{\an1}They multiplied?!

219
00:17:24,354 --> 00:17:25,622
{\an1}(strained grunts)

220
00:17:25,656 --> 00:17:27,056
{\an1}No, don't stop
moving!

221
00:17:33,496 --> 00:17:37,966
{\an4}I see that you've
mastered it, Maki.
But I won't let you
capture me!

222
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:39,067
{\an8}<i>Now's our chance!</i>

223
00:17:39,301 --> 00:17:41,936
On my cue, use
maximum waterpower!

224
00:17:41,969 --> 00:17:43,003
{\an1}Hey! Zaji!

225
00:17:43,037 --> 00:17:45,439
{\an1}Come on, Maki!
Bring it on!

226
00:17:45,973 --> 00:17:47,740
{\an1}You're going to have
to get through me!

227
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:51,711
{\an1}You certainly are
difficult. Then I'll
take care of you first!

228
00:17:51,744 --> 00:17:52,712
{\an1}Now, Ruka!

229
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,587
{\an1}It's my turn!

230
00:18:00,786 --> 00:18:01,853
{\an8}You're mine!

231
00:18:02,054 --> 00:18:02,688
(painful grunt)

232
00:18:10,962 --> 00:18:12,163
{\an1}We've got her now!

233
00:18:13,197 --> 00:18:14,798
{\an1}<i>Explosion Style!</i>

234
00:18:15,865 --> 00:18:17,067
{\an1}It's Gari!

235
00:18:17,267 --> 00:18:18,401
This is bad...

236
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:21,003
{\an1}All these people just
keep popping up out
of nowhere.

237
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:23,839
{\an1}You're an absolute
mess, Pakura.

238
00:18:24,306 --> 00:18:27,842
{\an4}<i>If I had recovered a</i>
<i>little later, it would</i>
<i>have been all over for</i>
<i>you.</i>

239
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:30,745
{\an1}<i>Are they really</i>
<i>that good?</i>

240
00:18:37,585 --> 00:18:40,821
{\an7}<i>You've gotten</i>
<i>strong, Maki.</i>

241
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:45,224
{\an4}The best thing about
this body is that you
can start over again
quickly.

242
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:48,394
{\an1}Well, let's continue.
It's time to finish
this.

243
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,464
<i>First that pesky</i>
<i>Sealing Jutsu user</i>
<i>goes...</i>

244
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:53,599
(surprised gasp)

245
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,834
No way! We
won't let you.

246
00:18:56,201 --> 00:19:00,372
{\an4}That's right! And
we're going to make
sure that you can't
start over ever again.

247
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:04,942
{\an4}You have no chance,
but you'll have plenty
of time to regret this
in the afterlife.

248
00:19:06,243 --> 00:19:07,143
{\an1}Huh?

249
00:19:07,176 --> 00:19:07,810
{\an1}(surprised gasps)

250
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:14,983
{\an1}<i>What do you think</i>
<i>you're doing, Pakura?</i>

251
00:19:15,017 --> 00:19:17,786
<i>If children don't hurt</i>
<i>themselves, they'll</i>
<i>never learn.</i>

252
00:19:17,986 --> 00:19:20,555
<i>So I feel like</i>
<i>giving them a</i>
<i>chance.</i>

253
00:19:21,223 --> 00:19:25,059
{\an7}I'm going to give them
this opportunity to
change their future!

254
00:19:25,426 --> 00:19:30,731
{\an4}I don't understand. Are
you actually feeling
some sympathy for your
old comrades?

255
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:34,601
I don't care how you
choose to take this.
Now run, Maki!

256
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:37,137
<i>Go! While I'm</i>
<i>still conscious!</i>

257
00:19:39,171 --> 00:19:41,273
{\an1}<i>I think we should</i>
<i>listen to what</i>
<i>she's saying.</i>

258
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,377
{\an5}Yeah, it would be
difficult to fight
them both together,
that's for sure.

259
00:19:45,411 --> 00:19:46,978
{\an1}Come on, Maki!
Let's go!

260
00:19:48,246 --> 00:19:49,614
{\an1}Maki, we...

261
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:52,417
Ruka, go.

262
00:19:54,017 --> 00:19:55,620
{\an7}<i>Hurry up, you two!</i>

263
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,192
(painful grunt)

264
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,228
{\an1}<i>Pakura of the Scorch</i>
<i>Style...</i>

265
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:10,733
{\an1}I always wanted to face
off against you in a
battle at least once.

266
00:20:10,766 --> 00:20:13,635
{\an1}But it seems I'll
never get that
chance now...

267
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:15,236
{\an3}Yes...

268
00:20:15,836 --> 00:20:18,872
My consciousness is
being taken away.

269
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:23,377
{\an8}<i>Maki...</i>

270
00:20:39,324 --> 00:20:42,460
{\an1}Still not able to
contact any of the
other teams?

00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:45,229
Can you please be
quiet for just a
minute?! It's hard

272
00:20:45,262 --> 00:20:46,397
<i>enough to hear</i>

273
00:20:47,263 --> 00:20:49,265
Hey, where'd Maki
run off to?

274
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:52,135
{\an1}Hm? She was here
just a second ago...

275
00:22:56,543 --> 00:23:03,149
{\an4}<i>Tsunade, when did you</i>

<i>No, it was long</i>

277
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:11,423

278
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,792
<i>out, I just kept</i>
<i>topping them off.</i>

279
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:20,129
{\an7}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Things You</i>
<i>Can't Get Back."</i>

280
00:23:20,163 --> 00:23:24,000
{\an1}<i>In this world, there</i>
<i>are some things you</i>
<i>can't get back...</i>
