00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,936
{\an1}We've been waiting
for you, Sasuke.

2
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:26,493
{\an4}It had already been decided
that the moment you abandoned
the Hidden Leaf Village you
would become our new leader.

3
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:30,655
{\an1}I hope you can
forgive the rudeness
we displayed earlier.

4
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,217
{\an1}(Sasuke)
Like I care.

5
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,376
{\an1}Let's go.

6
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,439
{\an1}It begins now.

Naruto!
Hey, Naruto!

8
00:00:48,234 --> 00:00:50,930
{\an1}What is it,
Shikamaru?

9
00:00:50,963 --> 00:00:55,357
{\an1}Seems Sasuke has left
the village. And he's
headed for Orochimaru's.

10
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:59,985
{\an4}[groan]
No way!
You gotta
be kidding!

11
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:06,044
{\an4}There's a strong possibility
that Orochimaru's men are
guarding Sasuke. Our mission
is to bring him back.

12
00:01:06,077 --> 00:01:07,575
{\an1}Hold on a second!

13
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:09,473
{\an1}I'll go get dressed!

14
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:17,595
{\an4}Oh well,
at least
I got five
and a dog.

15
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:20,792
{\an1}Alright!
C'mon!
Follow me!

16
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:21,524
{\an1}Wait.

{\an1}[grunt]

18
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:24,387
{\an1}I saved the
most important
thing for last.

19
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,279
{\an4}For as long as I've known
him, Sasuke and I haven't
exactly been close...
in fact I don't like him.

20
00:01:30,312 --> 00:01:30,979
[gasp]

21
00:01:31,012 --> 00:01:32,476
[gasp]

22
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,338
{\an4}But all the same,
Sasuke's a comrade
he belongs to the
Hidden Leaf Village.

23
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:38,569
{\an1}I'd trade my
life for his.

24
00:01:38,603 --> 00:01:40,500
{\an1}That's the way
of our Village.

25
00:01:42,564 --> 00:01:46,692
{\an4}That may be.
But to me,
Sasuke is a
close friend.

26
00:01:46,725 --> 00:01:51,221
{\an1}I don't say that just
because the two of us
were both in Squad Seven.

27
00:01:51,252 --> 00:01:52,984
{\an1}Even before
that, I...

28
00:01:53,017 --> 00:01:54,217
{\an1}Sasuke...

29
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:57,046
{\an1}..has been a friend
of all of ours from
way back in the day.

30
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:00,241
{\an1}Yeah. After all,
we were in the
same class.

31
00:02:00,274 --> 00:02:05,268
{\an1}I know one thing, that Sasuke
is talented. And I'm not going
to let the enemy take him.

32
00:02:05,302 --> 00:02:08,231
{\an1}[chuckle]
Thanks guys.

33
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:13,026
{\an1}So let's go!
We're gonna get
him back for sure!

34
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:16,887
{\an1}Okay, I'll explain
the formation we're
going to use.

35
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:18,652
{\an1}Hang on,
Sasuke!

36
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:21,049
{\an1}We're all on
our way to
rescue you!

37
00:02:23,412 --> 00:02:29,737
{\an4}Lord Orochimaru gave
us an important task
to take care of when
we reached this point.

38
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,732
{\an7}I'm afraid you're
going to have to
die, just this once.

39
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:36,861
{\an1}I must die,
this once?

40
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:40,691
{\an1}You will take
one of these.
Awakening pills.

41
00:02:40,724 --> 00:02:44,619
{\an7}And just what'll
happen after that?

42
00:02:44,652 --> 00:02:48,048
{\an1}Not to
worry
Sasuke.

43
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:50,244
{\an4}Why do you
think that
we're all
here?

44
00:02:50,277 --> 00:02:53,774
{\an1}We'll cast a Barrier
Ninjutsu to minimize
the transition.

45
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:57,835
{\an4}Instead of dying,
you'll only be
suspended in a
state of half-death.

too long, Tayuya.

{\an1}Why have you
come back here?

152
00:09:55,071 --> 00:10:02,794
{\an4}I understand much more now.
The strength of my life force
has increased since I escaped
the prison of human flesh.

or did you forget
that?!

the things we did together
in Squad Seven, mean absolutely

{\an1}We became

{\an1}Then why are
we fighting?!

225
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:26,525

there's far more <i>meaning</i>
in destroying you.
