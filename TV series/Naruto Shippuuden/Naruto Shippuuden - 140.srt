1
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:21,383
-Protect-- to protect me?

2
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:24,116
You've gotta be kidding me.

3
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,916
-I'll say it once more.

4
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,283
You think you know all
about your older brother,

5
00:00:28,316 --> 00:00:31,283
but you know nothing.

6
00:00:31,316 --> 00:00:34,616
-If you continue spouting
such nonsense and lies,

7
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,550
I'll kill you right here.

8
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:41,416
-You're not making this easy.

9
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,616
I suppose that's only natural
hearing a story like this

10
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,316
from a complete
stranger, but what

11
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,383
I'm telling you is the truth.

12
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,783
Itachi did mention
it, didn't he?

13
00:00:52,816 --> 00:00:55,616
That he wasn't alone that night,
that he had an accomplice.

14
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:02,316
I am Madara Uchiha.

15
00:01:07,483 --> 00:01:10,716
I know everything there
is to know about Itachi.

16
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,783
I suppose Itachi died
without realizing that.

17
00:01:14,816 --> 00:01:16,183
-Shut up!

18
00:01:16,216 --> 00:01:17,950
None of that matters anymore.

19
00:01:17,983 --> 00:01:20,616
Just get out of my
sight, you hear me?

20
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,450
-No, you will listen.

21
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:24,916
You need to hear this.

22
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,716
It's your obligation.

23
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,216
It's about the life
of your brother

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,616
who risked everything for
the sake of the Shinobi

25
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,783
world, the Hidden Leaf
village, and most of all

26
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:37,050
for you, his younger brother.

27
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,916
You will know how
Itachi Uchiha lived.

28
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:48,350
Do you know why?

29
00:01:48,383 --> 00:01:53,983
Why Itachi implanted the
Amaterasu into your eye?

30
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:59,683
It's because Itachi never
wanted us to meet or to talk.

31
00:01:59,716 --> 00:02:01,350
Listen to my tale and
you'll understand.

32
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,050
The only ones who knew
the truth about Itachi

33
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:11,450
were the Leaf's Danzo,
the Third Hokage,

34
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:13,950
and the two advisers
Homura and Koharu.

35
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,783
With the Third Hokage dead,
there are only three elders

36
00:02:19,816 --> 00:02:23,683
left who know the
secret, and they

37
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:26,650
are likely to never reveal
the abominable truth

38
00:02:26,683 --> 00:02:29,150
that they're hiding.

39
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:33,150
The truth about Itachi will
fade into darkness forever,

40
00:02:33,183 --> 00:02:35,216
just as Itachi himself wished.

41
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:44,316
However, I also know
the truth about Itachi.

42
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,050
As I said earlier, Itachi
never realized just how much

43
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,016
I knew about him.

44
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,116
Apparently, he wanted
to make doubly sure.

45
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,116
It seems that Itachi
didn't trust me,

46
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,916
and just in case I
did know the truth,

47
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,016
he planned to silence me with
the Amaterasu he implanted

48
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,316
in you.

49
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,550
He probably anticipated that
I would show you my sharingan

50
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:10,783
in order to speak to you.

51
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,083
-What are you saying?

52
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:16,950
What are you trying
to tell me here?

53
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,116
Protect me.

54
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,550
Protect me.

55
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:25,183
The truth.

56
00:03:31,016 --> 00:03:31,483
-Remember.

57
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:39,983
Think back carefully
and remember Itachi.

58
00:03:40,016 --> 00:03:41,450
[gasping]

59
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,283
Your kind and gentle
older brother.

60
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:10,483
-Hey, what's up?

61
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,650
-That building is where
Father works, isn't it?

62
00:04:16,683 --> 00:04:18,083
-Mmhm.

63
00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:21,183
Its headquarters for
the Leaf police force.

64
00:04:21,216 --> 00:04:24,483
-You know, I've been
wondering something.

65
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:26,416
How come the crest
of the Uchiha clan

66
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,950
is part of the Leaf
police force insignia?

67
00:04:28,983 --> 00:04:31,083
-What do you know,
you finally noticed.

68
00:04:31,116 --> 00:04:33,816
-Course I did.

69
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,216
-Right.

70
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,916
Let's see, to put it simply, it
was the Uchiha clan's earliest

71
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,350
ancestors who established
the police force here

72
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,783
in the Leaf village.

73
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,916
So when they created the
symbol for the organization,

74
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,316
they used the family crest.

75
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,650
Since a long time
ago, the Uchiha

76
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:54,216
have always ensured
the peace here.

77
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,650
The crest is a testament
of our clan's pride

78
00:04:56,683 --> 00:05:00,683
in a way of life centuries old.

79
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:04,350
Over the years, the Uchiha
clan has grown smaller,

80
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,950
but even now, nearly all of
us are a part of the force

81
00:05:07,983 --> 00:05:11,783
and work to uphold the
peace in this village.

82
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:15,083
Which is good, because only
the most exceptional of Shinobi

83
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:18,550
can weed out the criminals
hiding among their brethren.

84
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,616
SASUKE (THINKING): Wow,
Dad is the coolest.

85
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,983
-Are you going to
join the force, too?

86
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:26,116
-Well, I'm not sure.

87
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,050
-Why not?

88
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:33,316
-No, it's impossible.

89
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,650
No.

90
00:05:34,683 --> 00:05:37,450
He didn't want to protect
me, he just tried to kill me.

91
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:38,883
He tried to steal my eyes!

92
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:47,316
-Just who could do
something like this?

93
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,083
-My foolish little brother.

94
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,183
Mangekyo sharingan.

95
00:06:04,683 --> 00:06:07,450
[gasping, coughing]

96
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:10,883
-Calm down.

97
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,316
Breathe slowly.

98
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,250
[panting]

99
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,783
-Don't touch me!

100
00:06:30,383 --> 00:06:34,850
-Even if you do hate me, that's
what big brothers are for.

101
00:06:39,883 --> 00:06:41,750
-Sorry, Sasuke.

102
00:06:41,783 --> 00:06:43,350
Maybe some other time.

103
00:07:01,016 --> 00:07:01,683
[theme music]

104
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:57,986
-You're awake.

105
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,253
Sorry, I took the
liberty of tying you up

106
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:02,920
since it didn't seem you'd
stay still and listen

107
00:09:02,953 --> 00:09:03,653
to me otherwise.

108
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:14,220
-Itachi was my enemy.

109
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,720
He killed our mother and father.

110
00:09:16,753 --> 00:09:18,886
And he slaughtered
our whole clan.

111
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,153
He was a rogue ninja and
a member of the Akatsuki.

112
00:09:23,186 --> 00:09:26,686
He was despicable.

113
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,753
He was my only goal.

114
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,720
-That fateful night.

115
00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:35,053
It is true that he slaughtered
the entire Uchiha clan

116
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:38,420
and then fled the
Hidden Leaf Village.

117
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,486
-Then?

118
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,153
-But it was his
mission to do so.

119
00:09:42,186 --> 00:09:45,953
He was ordered by leaders
of the Hidden Leaf.

120
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:50,286
And that is just the beginning
of the truth about Itachi.

121
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,220
-It was his mission.

122
00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:55,153
-Yes.

123
00:09:55,186 --> 00:09:58,420
That night, Itachi set
aside his personal feelings

124
00:09:58,453 --> 00:10:00,420
and fulfilled his mission.

125
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,920
Well, it seems you've
finally calmed down.

126
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:07,586
-But I still don't understand.

127
00:10:10,153 --> 00:10:12,486
-In order to explain
Itachi's story,

128
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,486
I must take you back to the
beginning, when the Hidden Leaf

129
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,220
Village was founded.

130
00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:19,920
Itachi sacrificed
himself, a fate

131
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,886
that grew from a
longstanding power struggle.

132
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,220
He was callously
used to serve it.

133
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:27,886
-Sacrificed?

134
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,053
-That's right.

135
00:10:30,086 --> 00:10:32,886
A problem that hearkens
back to the very origins

136
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,020
of the founding of the
Hidden Leaf Village,

137
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,053
it determined the
path of Itachi's life.

138
00:10:41,786 --> 00:10:45,320
It's a long story, but every
word that I'm about to tell you

139
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,053
is the absolute truth.

140
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:50,620
-And on what ground
should I believe you?

141
00:10:50,653 --> 00:10:53,653
You're completely untrustworthy.

142
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:56,353
-I don't have any evidence
that I can show you,

143
00:10:56,386 --> 00:10:59,086
so it's up to you to decide
whether you believe me

144
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,020
or not, but only after you
listen to the entire story.

145
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,353
-Fine.

146
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:17,853
Talk.

147
00:11:21,886 --> 00:11:24,553
-It all started more
than 80 years ago.

148
00:11:28,753 --> 00:11:32,386
Back then, the world
was embroiled in battle.

149
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,620
It was an era of warring states.

150
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,886
Nations fought for
power, for the right

151
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,953
to exist, or to
expand their borders.

152
00:11:39,986 --> 00:11:43,586
During this time of strife,
Shinobi organizations

153
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,553
only consisted of individual
clans serving as armed units.

154
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:51,253
Various clans were
hired by various nations

155
00:11:51,286 --> 00:11:54,086
to participate in the
conflicts, and among all

156
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,720
of these numerous
ninja clans were

157
00:11:56,753 --> 00:12:01,386
two that were feared above
all others as the strongest.

158
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,620
One was our own Uchiha
clan, and the other

159
00:12:04,653 --> 00:12:09,020
was known as the Senju
clan of the forest.

160
00:12:09,053 --> 00:12:12,220
We of the Uchiha clan
possessed exceptional chakra

161
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:14,053
and the sharingan.

162
00:12:14,086 --> 00:12:16,520
Excelling in all
types of warfare,

163
00:12:16,553 --> 00:12:18,753
we became known
as a battle clan,

164
00:12:18,786 --> 00:12:22,853
and then I was born into our
clan, processing chakra that

165
00:12:22,886 --> 00:12:26,920
was especially powerful,
even for an Uchiha.

166
00:12:26,953 --> 00:12:30,953
The fact that I've lived this
long is proof enough of that.

167
00:12:30,986 --> 00:12:34,420
Back then, I spent every
day on the battlefield.

168
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,386
In an era where
power was everything,

169
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,153
at the cost of my friends
and younger brother,

170
00:12:40,186 --> 00:12:44,386
I continuously sought
ever more power.

171
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,886
-Damn you.

172
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,020
-But thanks to that, I was
able to awaken the mangekyo

173
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:53,386
sharingan fully, and I became
the leader of the Uchiha.

174
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,020
And with that power, I
fought the Senju clan

175
00:12:56,053 --> 00:12:58,353
more times than I can count.

176
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:00,053
Of course, it was
inevitable that I

177
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:03,320
would face Hashirama, the
leader of the Senju clan.

178
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,620
Hashirama Woodstyle Senju,
the future First Hokage,

179
00:13:10,653 --> 00:13:14,353
the man who stood at the top of
the ninja world, and the person

180
00:13:14,386 --> 00:13:16,120
that I respected most.

181
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,480
Led by Hashirama, who
became the very first

182
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:31,546
to claim the title of
Hokage, the Senju clan

183
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,513
became acknowledged
as the fiercest

184
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,780
and most feared by
all the other clans.

185
00:13:36,813 --> 00:13:40,913
Whenever the Senju made a
move, so did the Uchiha.

186
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,746
Our clan was pretty
much the only one

187
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,280
who could take them on.

188
00:13:44,313 --> 00:13:46,680
If a nation hired the
Senju, their opponents

189
00:13:46,713 --> 00:13:48,313
would hire the Uchiha.

190
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:50,213
We became rivals.

191
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,146
The more I faced
Hashirama, the more my name

192
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,780
became known, as well.

193
00:13:56,813 --> 00:14:04,580
-To reach the next level, to
test the limits of my ability.

194
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:06,513
-You stole your
brother's eyes merely

195
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,046
to heighten your own reputation?

196
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,813
Is that what you're telling me?

197
00:14:10,846 --> 00:14:13,846
-I did steal them,
but I did so only

198
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,180
to obtain the strength necessary
to protect the Uchiha clan.

199
00:14:18,213 --> 00:14:20,613
-To protect our clan.

200
00:14:20,646 --> 00:14:22,013
-Yes.

201
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:25,913
As the Uchiha's reputation grew,
so did its number of enemies.

202
00:14:25,946 --> 00:14:30,546
Amidst ferocious battles, it
was an unavoidable sacrifice

203
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,280
to protect our clan
from external foes,

204
00:14:33,313 --> 00:14:35,746
starting with the Senju clan.

205
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,846
It wasn't merely
for distinction.

206
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,813
My younger brother was fully
aware and agreed with it.

207
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:45,080
In fact, he volunteered
his eyes to me.

208
00:14:49,246 --> 00:14:53,913
But then one day, the
Senju clan proposed a truce

209
00:14:53,946 --> 00:14:59,113
with the Uchiha, and
the Uchiha accepted it.

210
00:14:59,146 --> 00:15:01,613
The majority on both
sides had grown weary

211
00:15:01,646 --> 00:15:03,713
of the endless conflict.

212
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:08,380
They had simply had enough
of all the fighting.

213
00:15:08,413 --> 00:15:12,646
I-- I was the only
one who opposed it.

214
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,280
I was the sole voice of dissent.

215
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:18,246
Where has all our mutual
hatred gone, I asked.

216
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,446
For what purpose had my
brother sacrificed himself?

217
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,446
The Uchiha and the Senju were
always like oil and water.

218
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,413
I couldn't help
feeling that one day,

219
00:15:34,446 --> 00:15:38,780
the Uchiha clan would come to
be oppressed by the Senju clan.

220
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,413
However, everyone else in the
Uchiha clan wanted the truce.

221
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:51,246
As their leader, I had
no choice but to go along

222
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,013
with their wishes.

223
00:15:55,346 --> 00:15:58,313
It wasn't too long
afterward that our alliance

224
00:15:58,346 --> 00:16:00,880
forged an agreement with
the Land of Fire, which

225
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:03,213
had sought stability
within their land.

226
00:16:03,246 --> 00:16:07,046
And thus the powerful system
of one village to one nation

227
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,713
came to be.

228
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:11,280
That was the Land of Fire
and the Village Hidden

229
00:16:11,313 --> 00:16:13,280
in the Leaves.

230
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:15,613
Other nations quickly
followed suit,

231
00:16:15,646 --> 00:16:18,546
and subsequently, one
by one, the fires of war

232
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,046
were at last extinguished.

233
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,146
Instantaneous peace, but due
to a certain incident, they

234
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,480
Hidden Leaf's peace
was short lived.

235
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:32,013
-What incident?

236
00:16:32,046 --> 00:16:33,446
-There was a battle
over the seat

237
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,513
of the village
leader, the Hokage.

238
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:41,013
As you already know,
the first to occupy that

239
00:16:41,046 --> 00:16:43,546
seat was Hashirama Senju.

240
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,580
Both the village and the
Land of Fire chose him.

241
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:49,513
It was clear the Uchiha were
being displaced from the power

242
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:51,213
structure.

243
00:16:51,246 --> 00:16:53,013
I decided to advocate
for an Uchiha

244
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:56,646
to take the leadership in
order to protect our clan.

245
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,346
I knew that path would lead to
a confrontation with Hashirama.

246
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:06,413
But no one, not even a single
Uchiha supported me at all.

247
00:17:06,446 --> 00:17:08,446
My followers shunned
me for trying

248
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,746
to rekindle the flames
of war, and betrayed me.

249
00:17:18,146 --> 00:17:20,346
I was not only
accused and berated

250
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,713
for having personal
ambitions, but more than

251
00:17:23,746 --> 00:17:27,546
that, they scorned me
as a selfish brother who

252
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,446
stole his younger brother's
eyes in order to save his own.

253
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,446
What man would wilfully hurt
his own younger brother?

254
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,213
I swore I only wanted
to protect the Uchiha.

255
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,613
I left the Hidden Leaf.

256
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,213
Having been betrayed
by everyone,

257
00:17:46,246 --> 00:17:48,413
I decided to return
as an avenger,

258
00:17:48,446 --> 00:17:51,646
and I declared war on
the Hidden Leaf Village.

259
00:18:08,246 --> 00:18:11,646
But I was defeated
at that place that

260
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,480
has come to be known
as the Final Valley.

261
00:18:14,513 --> 00:18:16,413
I was said to have died there.

262
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,380
I'm sure even Hashirama
believed that to be so,

263
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:26,080
and everyone forgot about me.

264
00:18:26,113 --> 00:18:30,013
History forgot about me.

265
00:18:30,046 --> 00:18:32,846
In order to prevent the
rise of another traitor,

266
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,013
Hashirama's younger brother,
who became the second Hokage,

267
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:41,113
bestowed upon the Uchiha
a special responsibility

268
00:18:41,146 --> 00:18:43,146
as proof of his trust.

269
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,080
He established the
Hidden Leaf police force.

270
00:18:46,113 --> 00:18:48,813
But the truth is that it
really removed the Uchiha

271
00:18:48,846 --> 00:18:50,680
from the governing
body of the village

272
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:54,013
and placed the entire clan under
close scrutiny of all in one

273
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:55,713
fell swoop.

274
00:18:55,746 --> 00:18:57,646
There were finally
some Uchiha who

275
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,213
recognized his true
motives, and there

276
00:19:00,246 --> 00:19:04,646
grew an anti-establishment
faction that inherited my will.

277
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,246
But it was too late.

278
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,646
Time passed, the leadership
stayed in the Senju's hands.

279
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,046
And the once proud
Uchiha clan members

280
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,846
were reduced to being
the Senju's lackeys,

281
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,580
and what I'd predicted
came to pass.

282
00:19:19,613 --> 00:19:22,580
And then another incident
sealed the Uchiha's demise.

283
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,980
That's right, the attack of the
nine-tailed fox 16 years ago.

284
00:19:37,446 --> 00:19:40,413
-What do you mean by that?

285
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,546
-Only the Uchiha's
visual prowess

286
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,813
can tame and control
the Nine-tails.

287
00:19:45,846 --> 00:19:48,213
So the elders of the
Hidden Leaf village

288
00:19:48,246 --> 00:19:53,046
surmised that an Uchiha was
behind the Nine-tails attack.

289
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,880
But it was a spontaneous
natural disaster.

290
00:19:55,913 --> 00:19:58,480
The Uchiha had
nothing to do with it,

291
00:19:58,513 --> 00:20:01,980
and yet unjust
suspicions persisted

292
00:20:02,013 --> 00:20:04,746
that the Uchiha had tried
to stage an insurrection

293
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,680
and seize power to take over
leadership of the village.

294
00:20:09,713 --> 00:20:12,513
As a result, the Uchiha were
put under strict surveillance

295
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:15,013
by the ANBU black
ops, and were forced

296
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:17,780
to relocate to the
outskirts of the village.

297
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:19,880
They became completely isolated.

298
00:20:22,613 --> 00:20:24,546
The third Hokage
was the only one

299
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,013
to voice opposition
to our treatment,

300
00:20:27,046 --> 00:20:30,380
but Danzo of the ANBU black ops
and the other two counselors

301
00:20:30,413 --> 00:20:31,946
wouldn't listen to him.

302
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,346
In the end, the Uchiha clan
was simply not trusted,

303
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,780
and that was the beginning of
the discrimination against us.

304
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:48,846
Distrust trust bred hatred,
and eventually their suspicions

305
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,413
became reality.

306
00:20:51,446 --> 00:20:54,513
The Uchiha clan
started plotting a coup

307
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:59,546
de tat to take over the village.

308
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,746
And so the Hidden Leaf's
leaders planted as spy

309
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,980
within the Uchiha
clan to watch us.

310
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:09,180
That spy was your older
brother, Itachi Uchiha.

311
00:21:14,513 --> 00:21:17,146
And that's when Itachi's
suffering began.

312
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:31,968
[theme music]

313
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:03,768
SASUKE: You've laid false
charges against the Uchiha.

314
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:05,701
MADARA: That's one
of Itachi's lies.

315
00:23:05,735 --> 00:23:07,468
SASUKE: No, I won't believe it.

316
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:08,635
This can't be true.

317
00:23:08,668 --> 00:23:10,101
