I knew you'd come.

00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,366
You being here must mean
that you killed Orochimaru.

-That's right.

19
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,666
Who are the others?

00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,500
-There are two others.

21
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:20,566
Jugo of the Northern
Hideout, and I'm

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,400
also getting Karin of
the Southern Hideout.

23
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:25,500
-You sure about that?

00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:26,833
-What's wrong?

-Ah, nothing, except that I
can barely stand those two.

I just don't think
we'd get along, is all.

just my $0.02.

I understand why you'd
picked me, of course,

30
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:46,233
but choosing those two is making
me wonder about you, Sasuke.

-Ordering me around like
some kind of big shot, huh.

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,700
I think it's time we clarified
our relationship, Sasuke.

37
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:03,200
-OK.

38
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:09,033
-You were the one who
chose to rescue me.

39
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:11,033
You made that
decision on your own.

40
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:13,533
I never said anything
about following you

41
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,800
if you came back for me.

42
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,100
Just because you
defeated Orochimaru

43
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:20,833
doesn't make you better than me.

44
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:23,366
Everybody wanted to kill him.

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,533
You were Orochimaru's favorite.

46
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:28,166
He let you stay by his
side, while the rest of us

47
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,700
were confined.

48
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,166
So, you just had more chances
to kill him than the rest of us.

I was just kidding you.

52
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:53,500
But I did just let
you go when I didn't

53
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:57,266
have to, which makes us even for
you letting me out of the tank.

54
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,966
I'm free of that prison
at last, and that

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,933
means I'm free to go do
whatever I want to do.

must have taken it.

that's obvious.

It's not going to

Sasuke, sorry, but since
Master Zabuza's blade is gone,

103
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,024
so is any chance of
me joining your team.

-What else can I do?

106
00:07:59,057 --> 00:08:00,791
I'm going to look for the sword.

107
00:08:00,824 --> 00:08:02,991
The blade of the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist

108
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,391
was passed down from
generation to generation.

109
00:08:05,424 --> 00:08:06,524
That's the tradition.

110
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:08,891
I was all set to become
one of those swordsmen.

111
00:08:08,924 --> 00:08:10,891
That's what I was training for.

112
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,857
So, it only makes sense that
if Master Zabuza is gone,

113
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:16,057
I'm the only one who should
inherit his Executioner's

114
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:17,257

such a hurry, not me.

Why are you putting a

Just what are you up to?

You're not going to say
something like that, are you?

-If you want to
conquer the world,

do it with your own team.

something much bigger.

-Hm, if anyone else said
they wanted something bigger

144
00:09:34,391 --> 00:09:36,757
than the whole world,
I wouldn't believe it.

145
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,991
But I don't know--
when you say it,

I start to think it maybe such
a thing is really possible.

You know The Great
Naruto Bridge?

150

You ever heard of a large

Tazuna, he lives by the river.

165
00:10:20,557 --> 00:10:21,024
[giggle]

166
00:10:21,057 --> 00:10:21,657
Yeah.

167
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:22,391
-Tazuna, huh?

168
00:10:26,657 --> 00:10:29,057
-So who's this Tazuna guy?

169
00:10:29,091 --> 00:10:32,391
-The master carpenter who
built the Great Naruto Bridge.

170
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,824
BRIDGE KEEPER: Sorry, the
boss isn't here right now.

171
00:10:34,857 --> 00:10:37,224
-All right then, where is he?

172
00:10:37,257 --> 00:10:39,757
-He and his grandson, Inari,
went to the Land of Lightning

173
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:40,824
to build a bridge.

174
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,657
No point in waiting
around for him, either.

175
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:44,624
They won't be back for
a whole other year.

176
00:10:44,657 --> 00:10:48,124
-Uh, the Land of Lightning,
you know how far away that is?

177
00:10:48,157 --> 00:10:49,224
-Maybe you can help us.

178
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:50,591
Do you know of a
large blade that

179
00:10:50,624 --> 00:10:52,424
was left near The
Great Naruto Bridge?

180
00:10:52,457 --> 00:11:01,391
-Oh, that old thing-- sure,
Tenzen Daikoku took it.

181
00:11:01,424 --> 00:11:04,857
He came here to fight the
ninja who wielded that blade.

182
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:07,291
But once he found out the
ninja was already dead,

183
00:11:07,324 --> 00:11:09,224
he just took the sword and left.

184
00:11:09,257 --> 00:11:10,157
[sigh]

185
00:11:13,557 --> 00:11:15,424
-This just keeps getting harder.

186
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:17,357
Now, we've got to find Tenzen.

187
00:11:17,391 --> 00:11:22,691
-Hm, he was an aid to the feudal
lord of the Land of Water.

188
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,124
Apparently, a whole
lot of his men

189
00:11:24,157 --> 00:11:26,857
were killed back when Master
Zabuza staged his coup

190
00:11:26,891 --> 00:11:29,491
in the Hidden Mist Village.

191
00:11:29,524 --> 00:11:32,857
And I guess he's held a
big grudge ever since.

192
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:36,391
-Hey, why don't you watch
where you;re going, loser.

193
00:11:36,424 --> 00:11:40,091
-How lucky, you're just the
guy we were hoping to find.

194
00:11:40,124 --> 00:11:42,824
[yelling]

195
00:11:42,857 --> 00:11:44,357
-Who the hell are you?

196
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:45,724
What do you want from me?

197
00:11:45,757 --> 00:11:49,024
-You just seem like someone who
might know all sorts of things.

198
00:11:49,057 --> 00:11:51,824
-Look, I don't know
anything about Tenzen, OK.

199
00:11:51,857 --> 00:11:55,091
-Tell us what you do know,
anything at all is fine .

200
00:11:55,124 --> 00:11:56,991
But don't make me ask you twice.

201
00:11:57,024 --> 00:11:57,491
[gasp]

202
00:11:57,524 --> 00:11:58,857

00:11:58,891 --> 00:11:59,357
-Well--

204
00:12:01,957 --> 00:12:03,857
STREET MAN: OK, OK, I'll talk.

205
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,691
Tenzen is a politician,
but that's not all his is.

206
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:09,457
He's also the leader of
a large band of thieves.

207
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:12,391
I hear that he doles out
huge bribes, left and right.

208
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:14,024
And because of that,
the feudal lords

209
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:16,224
let him do whatever
evil things he wants.

210
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:18,091
-See, you know a lot.

211
00:12:18,124 --> 00:12:20,524
So, where does he live?

212
00:12:20,557 --> 00:12:23,757
STREET MAN: His place is to the
south, deep inside the forest.

213
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,457
Rumor has it that several
thousand mercenaries guard it.

214
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:27,857
It's supposed to
be impenetrable.

215

-Who are you?

218
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:51,844
How did you get in here?

219
00:12:51,877 --> 00:12:55,244
SASUKE: The day after
tomorrow, over 10,000 soldiers

220
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:57,477
will lay siege to this castle.

221
00:12:57,511 --> 00:13:00,877
Make sure you gather
every available man.

222
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:02,677
and don't forget my name.

223
00:13:02,711 --> 00:13:03,911
It's Suigetsu.

224
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:07,311

00:13:07,844 --> 00:13:09,244
-Intruder!

227
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:11,977
All men, gather up your arms.

-Ah man, what in the
world is going on now?

231
00:13:23,811 --> 00:13:27,111
-Apparently, a rival clan
plans to attack Tenzen's castle

232
00:13:27,144 --> 00:13:28,711
tomorrow with an
army that numbers

233
00:13:28,744 --> 00:13:30,244
in the tens of thousands.

234
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,511
-No way.

235
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,644
Are you just making that up?

236
00:13:33,677 --> 00:13:35,511
[sigh]

237
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:37,077
-All right, fine.

238
00:13:37,111 --> 00:13:40,144
The more confused the enemy
is, the better my chances.

239
00:13:40,177 --> 00:13:42,611
Whether it's one opponent
or tens of thousands,

240
00:13:42,644 --> 00:13:44,877
it doesn't really matter
to a ninja like me.

241
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:48,111
I'll sneak in and steal the
Executioner's Blade right

242
00:13:48,144 --> 00:13:50,144
from under their noses.

243
00:13:50,177 --> 00:13:52,944
-All right, how
about a little wager?

244
00:13:52,977 --> 00:13:54,977
-A wager?

245
00:13:55,011 --> 00:13:58,644
-A competition to see who gets
the Executioner's Blade first.

246
00:13:58,677 --> 00:13:59,844
[laugh]

247
00:13:59,877 --> 00:14:01,577
-Never in a million
years did I expect

248
00:14:01,611 --> 00:14:03,877
you to have a
playful side, Sasuke.

249
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:05,644
All right, let's do it.

250
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:07,311
Sounds like my kind of fun.

251
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:08,811
-Then we start now.

252
00:14:08,844 --> 00:14:11,677
But there is one rule, Suigetsu.

253
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,211
Don't kill anyone.

254
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:15,477
-Huh?

[grumbles]

262
00:14:42,477 --> 00:14:45,144
-I guess you really
meant right now.

00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:49,577
Oh man, I'll never live it
down if I lose this bet.

264
00:14:49,611 --> 00:14:51,277
All right, let's do this then.

265
00:14:57,377 --> 00:15:01,677
-Fire style, fireball jutsu!

266

-Nice one.

I've got to hand
it to you, Sasuke.

268
00:15:05,544 --> 00:15:07,877
Sasuke, where did you go?

-Hey, that actually
tired me out a little.

00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:28,644
Now, to get what I want.

280
00:16:28,677 --> 00:16:30,177
-That's impossible.

281
00:16:30,211 --> 00:16:31,911
There's no way that
a single man could

282
00:16:31,944 --> 00:16:34,244
defeat all those
soldiers in combat.

00:16:34,277 --> 00:16:35,644
-There's a way.

284
00:16:35,677 --> 00:16:38,477
Attacking me with conventional
weapons is pretty much useless.

If conventional weapons are
useless, then how about this!

I was looking for that.

-You got him.

292
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:01,211
-You let your guard
down, and now you

293
00:17:01,244 --> 00:17:02,977
paid the price for
you're arrogance.

Did I forget to tell you?

00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:14,177
Blades don't work on me, see.

299
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:16,144
But I'm feeling
awfully jealous here.

300
00:17:16,177 --> 00:17:17,977
I didn't think anyone
would be able to wield

301
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:20,111
that sword without
special training.

302
00:17:20,144 --> 00:17:23,377
I guess it helps to have a
good strong physique, huh.

-Now, I hear you've been
telling anyone who'll

305
00:17:30,844 --> 00:17:33,144
listen that you killed
the demon Zabuza

306
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,877
and took this blade from him.

307
00:17:34,911 --> 00:17:37,111
-No way, not me.

308
00:17:37,144 --> 00:17:39,211
Lord Tenzen, he's the one.

309
00:17:39,244 --> 00:17:40,444
-I see.

310
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:43,444
So, you're the one who
killed Master Zabuza.

311
00:17:43,477 --> 00:17:45,177
-No, not me.

312
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:46,711
The person who
killed Zabuza was--

313
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:48,677
-Where's your respect?

314
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:51,277
-I mean Master Zabuza.

315
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:53,444
I was just trying to
say that it wasn't me.

316
00:17:53,477 --> 00:17:54,111
It was--

317
00:17:54,144 --> 00:17:55,344
[gasp]

318
00:17:55,377 --> 00:17:59,044
You're the one, the
one from yesterday.

319
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:01,077
Yes, him, right there.

320
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:04,044
He's the one you want, the
one who killed Master Zabuza.

321
00:18:04,077 --> 00:18:05,944
The only thing I did
was bring the blade

322
00:18:05,977 --> 00:18:08,977
back from where I found it.

323
00:18:09,011 --> 00:18:11,311
[laugh]

324
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:13,711
-I got to say, that's
pretty impressive.

00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:16,011
I was amazed you could come
up with such a good lie,

326
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:17,711
under the circumstances and all.

327
00:18:17,744 --> 00:18:20,677
[laugh]

328
00:18:20,711 --> 00:18:22,111
Suigetsu--

329
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:23,744
-You're so thoughtful.

330
00:18:23,777 --> 00:18:26,777
I was starting to
feel a bit dehydrated.

331
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:28,577
I think you've got
the wrong idea.

332
00:18:28,611 --> 00:18:30,711
I knew Master
Zabuza, but it's not

333
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:34,744
like he and I were
particularly close.

334
00:18:34,777 --> 00:18:37,144
-Oh--

335
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:41,177
-But still, he was
an elder of mine.

336
00:18:41,211 --> 00:18:42,344
[gasp]

337
00:18:42,377 --> 00:18:46,077
[scream]

338
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:49,411
-I can't let rumors keep flying
around about him losing to you,

339
00:18:49,444 --> 00:18:52,577
especially when you're
a bunch of losers.

340
00:18:52,611 --> 00:18:54,944
You understand.

341
00:18:54,977 --> 00:18:57,411
-You-- you'll never get
away with this, you know.

342
00:18:57,444 --> 00:18:59,711
You can't just walk in
here and do what you want.

343
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:03,144
-You have to pay for what
you did, you know that.

344
00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:04,477
[whimper]

345
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:08,244
-I think I'll test
this out on you.

346
00:19:08,277 --> 00:19:09,477
-Just forget it.

347
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:11,411
What's the point of killing
someone like him anyway?

348
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:15,211
[scream]

349
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:21,111
-I've cut through all the main
support pillars, so you better

350
00:19:21,144 --> 00:19:23,744
get out of here quickly.

351
00:19:23,777 --> 00:19:27,211
I'm sparing your life, such
as it is, out of respect

352
00:19:27,244 --> 00:19:28,977
for Sasuke.

353
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:31,344
-Sasuke-- no, not him.

354
00:19:31,377 --> 00:19:32,777
The Sasuke that
killed Orochimaru--

355
00:19:35,777 --> 00:19:37,811
-Hey, did you hear what
that guy just said?

356
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,177
You're famous, Sasuke.

357
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,911
They know about you even way
out here in these back woods.

358
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:43,677
[crash]

359
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:47,977
[yells]

360
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:49,411
[scream]

361
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:53,177
[laugh]

362
00:19:53,211 --> 00:19:55,544
-You know, as long
as I have this blade,

363
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:56,877
I could defeat even you.

364
00:19:56,911 --> 00:19:57,944
Well, maybe.

365
00:20:00,844 --> 00:20:03,944
Hold on, you knew that I was
going to go after this blade

366
00:20:03,977 --> 00:20:06,311
even before you
freed me, didn't you?

367
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:08,511
And wait, you also
knew from the start

368
00:20:08,544 --> 00:20:12,677
that the blade wasn't at
the grave site anymore.

369
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,911
Of course, and the one who told
that guy his castle was going

370
00:20:15,944 --> 00:20:17,811
to be attacked and got
them together all of us

371
00:20:17,844 --> 00:20:20,844
men together was you.

372
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:22,611
Tenzen acted like
he'd met you before,

373
00:20:22,644 --> 00:20:24,844
and I don't think
that was a lie.

374
00:20:24,877 --> 00:20:27,444
Hey wait, did you
suggest that wager just

375
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:31,244
to get me to go into
enemy territory with you?

376
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:33,644
Was this your way of testing me?

377
00:20:33,677 --> 00:20:35,311
It was, wasn't it.

378
00:20:35,344 --> 00:20:36,511
[chuckle]

379
00:20:36,544 --> 00:20:38,211
Man, you're terrible.

380
00:20:38,244 --> 00:20:40,811
I could have gotten
seriously hurt doing that.

381
00:20:40,844 --> 00:20:44,277
Well, at least now I understand
exactly what kind of person

382
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:45,611
you are.

383
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:50,177
And you're pretty much just
the way I imagine you'd be.

384
00:20:50,211 --> 00:20:52,611
Well anyway, I got
my blade, so I'll

385
00:20:52,644 --> 00:20:56,144
help you just like I promised.

386
00:20:56,177 --> 00:20:57,111
Now what?

387
00:20:57,144 --> 00:20:58,444
Which way do we go?

388
00:20:58,477 --> 00:21:00,111
No wait, let me guess.

389
00:21:00,144 --> 00:21:02,311
Whatever path is
closest-- I bet that's

390
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,044
what you're going
to say, isn't it?

391
00:21:04,077 --> 00:21:07,244
I'm starting to get
inside your head, Sasuke.

392
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:10,677
-Hm, yeah, let's take
the closest path.

393
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:15,644
-Oh.

394
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,677
-Just because Orochimaru
is dead doesn't

395
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:23,177
mean you can do
whatever you want.

396
00:21:23,211 --> 00:21:25,311
[gasp]

397
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:26,944
-The sensation of chakra--

398
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:27,711
[gasp]

399
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,444
It can't be.

400
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:44,078
[theme music]

401
00:21:44,078 --> 00:23:01,444
[theme music]

402
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:08,244
SUIGETSU: Why are you
dragging a team together?

403
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:10,944
-I have a goal and
having a team will

404
00:23:10,978 --> 00:23:12,811
let me reach that goal faster.

405
00:23:12,844 --> 00:23:15,878
-OK, but I'll still not
sure why you chose Karin.

406
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:17,278
You could do better.

407
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:20,344
I mean, unlike me, she was
one of Orochimaru's followers.

408
00:23:20,378 --> 00:23:22,978
Besides, that
personality of hers is--

409
00:23:23,011 --> 00:23:25,644
SASUKE: But she has
a special ability.

410
00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:28,711
-Yeah, I can't argue
with you on that one.

411
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:32,311
