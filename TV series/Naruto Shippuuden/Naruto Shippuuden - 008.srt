avoid a battle if
at all possible.

But mentally, you
haven't matured as well.

-Naruto, I've chosen
an easier mission

104

to start with to break you in.

You've been gone
from us for a while.

an easier mission?

-Just shut up, will you?

It's only a sand clone.

-No way.

-What is it?

138
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,130
What's happened?

139
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,566
-It's the Kazekage of the sand.

140
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:31,571
It seems he's been taken
prisoner by the Akatsuki.

141
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,840
-You mean Gara.

142
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:34,974
So they're back again.

143
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,314
-We've been studying them.

144
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,818
We know more about the Akatsuki
than any other village.

145
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:49,155
Therefore, the sand village has
officially requested our help.

146
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:52,892
--[gasp] You're not suggesting
that team Kakashi--

147
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,260
-This is urgent.

148
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,930
I haven't time to
form another squad.

149
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,265
And besides, we
have someone here

150
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,267
who's actually
fought the Akatsuki.

151
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,403
Yes, but even so--

152
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,571
-All right.

153
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,973
Team Kakashi, I'm assigning
you a new mission.

154
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,142
You're to go to the
sand village at once.

155
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,443
Find out what's going on there.

156
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:12,212
And keep us informed.

157
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,681
You're to remain there,
and follow their orders.

158
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,216
Give them any backup they need.

159
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:30,430
-(THINKING) But how?

160
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,664
Ah!

161

How does he-- how is he
able to anticipate and avoid

162
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:45,345
every attack I make, and
without moving a muscle?

163
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,714
-What's wrong?

164
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:48,882
Run out of tricks?

165
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,052
-I'm just getting started!

FEMALE SPEAKER: Ambu black
ops intelligence report--

330
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:45,965
the alliance between
the leaf and sand.

331
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:48,467
During the exams, an
attack was launched

332
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,902
against the leaf village.

333
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,271
The sand village had
conspired with the Rochimaru

334
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,806
to destroy the leaf.

335
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,775
These were perilous times,
especially after the leaf

336
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,711
lost their reviewed
Third Hokage.

337
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:02,181
But when the sand's own Kazakage
was assassinated as well,

338
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,149
they realized they
had been betrayed.

339
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:06,452
They renounced their
alliance with the Rochimaru,

340
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,820
confessed their
part in the plot,

341
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:10,623
and offered peace to the leaf.

342
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:14,126
Eager to begin the process of
rebuilding, the leaf accepted.

343
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,662
And the two lands
formed an alliance.

344
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,465
The sand has incorporated much
of the leaf's training program

345
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,001
in the development
of their own Shinobe.

346
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:24,003
As the lands grew
closer, questions

347
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:27,273
arose about the relationship
between Shikamaru and Tamare.

348
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:29,708
Shikamaru asserts that
it's strictly professional.

349
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,810
But Naruto has his doubts.

350
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:35,514
In any case, all signs point to
a strong and durable alliance,

351
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:38,784
which will benefit both
lands in the future.
