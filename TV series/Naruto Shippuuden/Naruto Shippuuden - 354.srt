162
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:15,022
Ten...

163
00:18:18,822 --> 00:18:19,588
[gasp]

164
00:18:24,922 --> 00:18:27,355
[angry yell]

165
00:18:29,587 --> 00:18:30,654
Wood Style!

166
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:42,753
[growl]

167
00:18:52,453 --> 00:18:53,319
[gasp]

168
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:12,851
[gasps]

169
00:20:00,881 --> 00:20:01,881
It's Yukimi!

170
00:20:19,413 --> 00:20:20,880
{\an1}I didn't find Orochimaru.

171
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:23,613
{\an1}Nor did I encounter
a strange clan...

172
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:26,312
Nor anyone from
the Foundation.

173
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:36,212
[chuckle]

174
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:40,745
{\an1}You know what? I'm not
scared of the wind anymore.

175
00:20:40,778 --> 00:20:42,979
I'm gonna walk
straight ahead.

176
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:44,945
{\an1}Into my own future.

177
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:07,242
{\an1}<i>All I can really do for</i>
<i>now is live by the rules.</i>

178
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:09,109
<i>But that's okay.</i>

179
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,910
{\an1}<i>Beause now I know</i>
<i>that I'm capable of</i>

180
00:21:12,943 --> 00:21:14,810
{\an1}<i>protecting someone.</i>

181
00:22:58,903 --> 00:23:00,401
{\an1}<i>It's been a while, Kakashi.</i>

182
00:23:00,435 --> 00:23:03,002
{\an1}<i>He knows how to fight</i>
<i>against my Sharingan. </i>

183
00:23:03,035 --> 00:23:05,702
{\an1}<i>This was his intent</i>
<i>from the very beginning!</i>

184
00:23:05,735 --> 00:23:07,969
{\an1}<i>Why do you want to kill me?</i>

185
00:23:08,002 --> 00:23:09,401
<i>It's my mission.</i>

186
00:23:09,435 --> 00:23:12,501
<i>Stop, Kinoe!</i>
<i>Abandon this mission!</i>

187
00:23:12,535 --> 00:23:15,300
<i>To a shinobi, a</i>
<i>mission is absolute!</i>

188
00:23:15,334 --> 00:23:19,200
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "The</i>
<i>Targeted Sharingan."</i>

189
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:22,701
{\an1}<i>I will complete my mission!</i>
