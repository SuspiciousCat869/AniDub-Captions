1
00:00:27,308 --> 00:00:28,708
-Eh?

2
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:29,210
-Ah!

3
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,714
-Focus.

4
00:00:34,747 --> 00:00:36,282
{\an1}You're still moving.

5
00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:38,717
{\an1}Even if it's just a little.

6
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:42,489
{\an1}Remember, don't move.

7
00:00:42,522 --> 00:00:44,089
{\an1}-Doing this stuff
without the toad oil

8
00:00:44,123 --> 00:00:47,292
{\an1}is a lot harder than I
thought it was going to be.

9
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:49,194
{\an1}-Well, of course it is.

10
00:00:49,228 --> 00:00:52,731
{\an1}Just want did you expect when
you stopped using the shortcut?

11
00:00:52,764 --> 00:00:53,232
-Hm?

12
00:00:57,136 --> 00:00:59,338
{\an1}-Not even the slightest quiver.

13
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:02,206
{\an1}-You know, I just
thought of this, but--

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,542
-What is it?

15
00:01:03,575 --> 00:01:05,409
{\an1}-Why can't I just
take this oil with me

16
00:01:05,443 --> 00:01:06,777
{\an1}and use it when I fight?

17
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:09,147
{\an1}Then I wouldn't even have to
learn all this stuff about how

18
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,316
{\an1}to take in nature
energy without the oil.

19
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,783
{\an1}-That isn't possible.

20
00:01:13,817 --> 00:01:14,619
-Huh?

21
00:01:14,651 --> 00:01:15,819
Why?

22
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:17,187
-Outside of Mt.

23
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,723
{\an1}Myoboku's climate, this oil
evaporates almost immediately.

24
00:01:19,756 --> 00:01:21,690
{\an1}It just vaporizes.

25
00:01:21,724 --> 00:01:22,691
-What?

26
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:24,294
Are you serious?

27
00:01:24,327 --> 00:01:26,729
-I already told
you, the oil is just

28
00:01:26,762 --> 00:01:31,167
{\an1}a tool to help you
grasp the concept.

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,334
-Yes, sir!

30
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:34,370
-But the way you
transform into a frog

31
00:01:34,403 --> 00:01:37,239
{\an1}so quickly-- your
powers of concentration

32
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:39,674
{\an1}are still lacking.

33
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:41,042
Now be serious.

34
00:01:41,075 --> 00:01:41,644
-I am.

35
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:43,178
I promise I am.

36
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:46,482
{\an1}Despite how it looks, I did
learn the tricks to focus.

37
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:47,583
-That is enough.

38
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:49,517
{\an1}You just come along with me now.

39
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:03,297
-What's this?

40
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,065
{\an1}This isn't what I
think it is, is it?

41
00:02:05,098 --> 00:02:05,566
-Yes.

42
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,766
Exactly.

43
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,404
{\an1}This is where you're
going to be training next.

44
00:02:10,437 --> 00:02:12,838
{\an1}Balance a stone slab
atop the highest point

45
00:02:12,872 --> 00:02:14,575
{\an1}and begin meditation.

46
00:02:14,608 --> 00:02:17,910
{\an1}If your concentration wavers
and you move even slightly,

47
00:02:17,944 --> 00:02:19,711
{\an1}you'll fall to the bottom.

48
00:02:19,744 --> 00:02:21,813
{\an1}-I'd fall from way up there?

49
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:30,121
-OK.

50
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:32,591
{\an1}This should do just fine.

51
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:33,525
{\an1}Follow me, Naruto boy.

52
00:02:45,869 --> 00:02:47,037
Stay still.

53
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:50,374
{\an1}You must learn to stop
your motion as an animal.

54
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:52,576
{\an1}You need to find your
center of balance

55
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,847
{\an1}and motionlessly synchronize
with nature around you.

56
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,816
{\an1}NARUTO: Ah-- whoa-- whoa!

57
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:07,889
Whoa.

58
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:09,024
You saved me.

59
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:11,628
{\an1}-You have to wait on
taking in nature energy

60
00:03:11,661 --> 00:03:14,329
{\an1}until you learn how to
perfect being still.

61
00:03:14,363 --> 00:03:18,467
[stuttering]

62
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,336
[scream]

63
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:21,836
-Uh-oh!

64
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:33,047
{\an1}-Naruto boy, maybe it's time we
took a little break from this.

65
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,352
-Damn.

66
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:41,988
{\an1}I can't believe how difficult
it is just to stay still.

67
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,191
{\an1}Doesn't this training
seem sort of ridiculous?

68
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,160
{\an1}-That is utter nonsense.

69
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,129
Your master,
Jiraiya boy, managed

70
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,064
{\an1}to learn this very
same exercise himself.

71
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:53,032
-What?

72
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,467
Are you serious?

73
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,036
{\an1}You're telling me Pervy
Sage trained here, too?

74
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,337
-That's right.

75
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,273
{\an1}The two of us came here to
train together quite often.

76
00:04:10,214 --> 00:04:12,283
{\an1}-Thanks, Lord Fukasaku.

77
00:04:12,317 --> 00:04:15,053
{\an1}-Jiraiya boy, I think that
we should call it a day.

78
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:17,288
{\an1}What do you think?

79
00:04:17,322 --> 00:04:18,723
-Naw, I'm fine.

80
00:04:18,756 --> 00:04:23,060
{\an1}I can keep going like
this all day long.

81
00:04:23,093 --> 00:04:24,995
{\an1}-But Jiraiya boy--

82
00:04:25,028 --> 00:04:27,864
{\an1}-I think I'm just on the
verge of really getting this.

83
00:04:27,898 --> 00:04:32,034
{\an1}So can you help me
a little longer?

84
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:37,373
{\an1}-I'll give him this, he had more
guts than anyone else around.

85
00:04:37,406 --> 00:04:38,675
-Hey.

86
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:42,278
{\an1}About how long did Pervy
Sage take to learn this?

87
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:45,781
{\an1}-Well, he could only come here
to train when Jiraiya boy was

88
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:48,384
{\an1}in between the many missions
that the Hidden Leaf sent him

89
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:49,585
on.

90
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:53,088
{\an1}So it took him quite some
time to master it all.

91
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:55,924
-I see.

92
00:04:55,957 --> 00:04:57,625
-Naruto boy?

93
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:59,694
{\an1}-Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.

94
00:04:59,728 --> 00:05:01,962
{\an1}I don't have time,
so I guess I'll just

95
00:05:01,995 --> 00:05:03,565
{\an1}have to pick up the pace.

96
00:05:03,598 --> 00:05:10,270
{\an1}If Pervy Sage did the same
training, I'll do my best, too.

97
00:05:10,304 --> 00:05:14,241
[theme music]

98
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:10,749
[scream]

99
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:12,150
-That sucked.

100
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:15,053
{\an1}-You simply have to
focus harder, Naruto boy.

101
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:28,999
-So colorful.

102
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,334
It looks tasty.

103
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,301
-Ah.

104
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:33,838
{\an1}Hey, would you like
one, Naruto boy?

105
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:37,774
{\an1}It's my favorite,
larvae rice balls.

106
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:39,243
-No thank you.

107
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,183
-Can't watch.

108
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:34,894
{\an1}FUKASAKU (VOICEOVER):
It's going well.

109
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:37,162
{\an1}He's rapidly amassing
nature energy.

110
00:08:57,448 --> 00:08:58,082
Yes.

111
00:08:58,115 --> 00:09:00,184
{\an1}He's finally got it.

112
00:09:00,217 --> 00:09:03,120
{\an1}I'm impressed at how far he's
gotten without using the oil.

113
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,135
{\an1}He's displaying the
rings around his eyes,

114
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:21,304
{\an1}proof of successful sagehood.

115
00:09:21,338 --> 00:09:23,974
{\an1}And no frog aspects, either.

116
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:25,942
This could mean
that Naruto boy will

117
00:09:25,976 --> 00:09:29,345
{\an1}become a sage, one that
surpasses Jiraiya boy.

118
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:32,948
{\an1}It seems he's able to build
up even more Sage Jutsu

119
00:09:32,982 --> 00:09:36,184
{\an1}chakra than when he was
using the oil, tool.

120
00:09:36,217 --> 00:09:37,820
{\an1}-Well, how does it feel?

121
00:09:37,853 --> 00:09:41,122
{\an1}-You know, I think I'm
finally getting it now.

122
00:09:41,155 --> 00:09:42,357
{\an1}How to become one with nature.

123
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,833
Ah-- ah--

124
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:53,300
[scream]

125
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:02,709
-Wait, hold on.

126
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:07,346
{\an1}It hardly hurts at all.

127
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,180
-Exactly.

128
00:10:08,214 --> 00:10:10,083
{\an1}That's because of Sage Mode.

129
00:10:10,117 --> 00:10:13,285
{\an1}Your body has become
activated in a whole new way.

130
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:14,121
-Oh, wow!

131
00:10:14,153 --> 00:10:14,820
That's amazing.

132
00:10:14,854 --> 00:10:16,689
{\an1}That's Sage Mode, huh?

133
00:10:16,722 --> 00:10:20,225
{\an1}-And now that we have mastered
Sage Mode and nature energy,

134
00:10:20,258 --> 00:10:22,662
{\an1}we have come to one final step.

135
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:23,561
-What?

136
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:25,730
{\an1}There's one final step to go?

137
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:28,034
{\an1}You mean we're not done yet?

138
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:30,201
{\an1}-A type of sparring
sages perform

139
00:10:30,235 --> 00:10:32,237
{\an1}using Sage Jutsu chakra.

140
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,473
{\an1}Now I shall teach you how to do
Frog Kumite to spar with frogs.

141
00:10:44,581 --> 00:10:47,151
{\an1}-You are so useless.

142
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:50,054
{\an1}Why did you leave behind
my executioner's blade?

143
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:51,487
{\an1}-Shut up, Suigetsu.

144
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:53,957
{\an1}You should just be thankful
that we didn't leave you behind,

145
00:10:53,991 --> 00:10:54,557
too!

146
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,060
-How dare you?

147
00:10:56,093 --> 00:10:58,995
{\an1}You know, you were knocked out
just as much as I was, Karin.

148
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:02,031
{\an1}-I ended up that way trying
to protect all of you.

149
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:05,034
{\an1}-All of us were protecting
each other, you guys.

150
00:11:05,068 --> 00:11:06,301
{\an1}We're like fish in water.

151
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:08,437
{\an1}We can't do without one another.

152
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,504
{\an1}So stop your quarreling.

153
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,147
{\an1}-Yeah, all right.

154
00:11:19,181 --> 00:11:20,481
Fine.

155
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,416
{\an1}But anyway, are we really
going to get the Tailed Beast's

156
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,252
{\an1}power now, Sasuke?

157
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:25,987
-Who knows?

158
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:27,254
Maybe.

159
00:11:27,288 --> 00:11:31,926
{\an1}But actually, we no longer
need to depend on such things.

160
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,928
-Why's that?

161
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:37,031
{\an1}SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Because
I have obtained new powers.

162
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:39,566
{\an1}Powers strong enough for me
to take down the Hidden Leaf

163
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,067
Village.

164
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,237
{\an1}-Is something wrong, Sasuke?

165
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:54,246
{\an1}-It's nothing at all.

166
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,948
{\an1}-What is it, Karin?

167
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,883
{\an1}-I sense a chakra outside.

168
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,283
{\an1}It seems we were followed.

169
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:08,926
-Go now.

170
00:12:18,368 --> 00:12:22,839
{\an1}Please forgive me,
Lord Raikage, but it

171
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:24,674
appears my tail
was unsuccessful.

172
00:12:42,057 --> 00:12:45,393
{\an1}-Not only Yugito,
but now B, too.

173
00:12:45,426 --> 00:12:47,662
{\an1}I can't believe that
B has been taken down.

174
00:12:47,696 --> 00:12:50,232
{\an1}-We have received several
messenger lizards.

175
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:52,967
{\an1}J's been sending them
to us frequently.

176
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:56,337
{\an1}When we locate the enemy,
we'll send in four teams.

177
00:12:56,371 --> 00:12:59,641
{\an1}They'll get Lord Killer
B and wipe out the enemy.

178
00:12:59,674 --> 00:13:01,876
{\an1}-So, I heard it was an Uchiha.

179
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,946
{\an1}One from the Hidden Leaf
who took my little brother.

180
00:13:04,979 --> 00:13:07,815
Why is an Uchiha
in the Akatsuki?

181
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:09,516
{\an1}-It was Sasuke Uchiha.

182
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,520
{\an1}He went rogue from the Hidden
Leaf Village quite a while ago.

183
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:15,889
{\an1}-And why isn't the
Hokage doing anything

184
00:13:15,923 --> 00:13:17,657
{\an1}about their rogue ninja?

185
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,725
{\an1}They were quick to react
to the Hyuga incident.

186
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:28,034
{\an1}-Something's going wrong.

187
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:30,335
{\an1}The messages have ceased.

188
00:13:30,368 --> 00:13:31,570
{\an1}I don't like this.

189
00:14:06,502 --> 00:14:11,241
{\an1}-Well, Naruto boy,
let's call it a day.

190
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:11,741
-No.

191
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:13,042
Not yet.

192
00:14:13,076 --> 00:14:13,810
-It's not you.

193
00:14:13,843 --> 00:14:15,945
{\an1}I'm the one that can't go on.

194
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:18,614
{\an1}However, you are starting
to get the hang of it,

195
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:21,583
I'm glad to say.

196
00:14:21,617 --> 00:14:22,551
-Yes, sir.

197
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,492
{\an1}-What did you say?

198
00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:08,027
{\an1}What are you talking about?

199
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,930
{\an1}The messages from J
have stopped coming in?

200
00:15:10,963 --> 00:15:13,798
{\an1}-It would seem that J has
either been killed or captured

201
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:15,100
by the enemy.

202
00:15:15,134 --> 00:15:19,203
{\an1}So now we won't be able
to locate their position.

203
00:15:19,237 --> 00:15:21,372
{\an1}-Figure out as much as
you can from the intel

204
00:15:21,406 --> 00:15:22,774
{\an1}he's already sent back.

205
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:24,709
{\an1}And start combing the area.

206
00:15:24,742 --> 00:15:27,278
{\an1}Send the whole battalion,
if you have two.

207
00:15:27,312 --> 00:15:29,746
-Yes-- yes, sir.

208
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,383
{\an1}-And summon Samui's
platoon, as well.

209
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:34,551
{\an1}They'll take a document
of intent to the Leaf,

210
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:37,721
{\an1}saying that we'll take
care of Sasuke Uchiha.

211
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:39,488
{\an1}And get their intel on him.

212
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,223
-Yes.

213
00:15:40,257 --> 00:15:41,992
Right away, sir.

214
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:45,429
{\an1}-Furthermore, I'll convene a
Five Kage Summit conference

215
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:47,431
{\an1}with the five great nations.

216
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:51,334
{\an1}The Akatsuki will
not be forgiven!

217
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,902
-Omio, Karui.

218
00:15:52,935 --> 00:15:54,703
{\an1}I've just received
word that Lord Raikage

219
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:56,571
{\an1}has summoned all of us.

220
00:15:56,604 --> 00:15:59,075
-Summoned, huh?

221
00:15:59,108 --> 00:16:01,543
{\an1}-What in the world could it be?

222
00:16:01,576 --> 00:16:03,912
{\an1}Maybe some kind of
crisis has occurred?

223
00:16:03,945 --> 00:16:07,481
{\an1}Or could it be we're
going to be reprimanded?

224
00:16:07,514 --> 00:16:10,484
{\an1}Does he know that my
body mass index spiked?

225
00:16:10,517 --> 00:16:11,785
Hm.

226
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:13,421
{\an1}Maybe putting mayonnaise
on my potatoes

227
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:16,023
{\an1}wasn't such a good idea.

228
00:16:16,056 --> 00:16:16,991
-Stop.

229
00:16:17,024 --> 00:16:18,826
{\an1}You always think too much, Omoi.

230
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:21,662
{\an1}Why would he scold you
for something like that?

231
00:16:21,695 --> 00:16:25,966
{\an1}At most, you'd just be sent
out to buy protein drinks.

232
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,768
{\an1}-Being around you
guys is really tiring.

233
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:31,504
{\an1}Oh, my shoulders.

234
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:33,206
-Your shoulders
are probably sore

235
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:35,141
because of your
well endowed figure,

236
00:16:35,174 --> 00:16:37,576
{\an1}but there's a chance
it's something else.

237
00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:40,179
{\an1}What you thought were
still shoulders could be--

238
00:16:40,213 --> 00:16:41,980
{\an1}-Oh, just shut up!

239
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:44,149
{\an1}Quit your yakking and
let's go, already.

240
00:16:44,182 --> 00:16:47,487
{\an1}-You really should think
things through more carefully.

241
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,621
{\an1}Your shoulders aren't sore
'cause you're so flat.

242
00:16:49,654 --> 00:16:51,823
-Shut up!

243
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:52,656
-Ow!

244
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,624
{\an1}-You got something else to say?

245
00:16:53,657 --> 00:16:54,359
{\an1}-That kick's the just beginning.

246
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:55,260
It'll cause--

247
00:16:55,293 --> 00:16:56,395
-You two.

248
00:16:56,428 --> 00:16:58,696
{\an1}If you're really ninja,
you should act like it.

249
00:16:58,729 --> 00:16:59,398
Let's go.

250
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:14,010
-I did it.

251
00:17:14,044 --> 00:17:15,612
I pulled it off.

252
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,859
{\an1}Even though it's still
far from perfect,

253
00:17:30,893 --> 00:17:33,962
{\an1}I'm gonna have to
try it in Sage Mode.

254
00:17:33,996 --> 00:17:37,466
{\an1}And I have to make sure
that nobody catches me.

255
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,145
-It's J.

256
00:18:27,178 --> 00:18:29,114
{\an1}-We didn't make it in time.

257
00:18:43,293 --> 00:18:43,961
-Yes, sir.

258
00:18:43,994 --> 00:18:45,295
{\an1}Mission acknowledged.

259
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:47,030
{\an1}-I'm counting on you.

260
00:18:47,064 --> 00:18:47,797
-I knew.

261
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,200
{\an1}I knew this was bad news.

262
00:18:50,234 --> 00:18:51,602
Man.

263
00:18:51,634 --> 00:18:52,835
{\an1}-Don't worry about it.

264
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:55,905
{\an1}There's no way Lord Killer
B would mess up like that.

265
00:18:55,938 --> 00:18:57,707
{\an1}I bet it's just a bad
prank, or something.

266
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:02,711
{\an1}-How can you be so optimistic?

267
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:05,314
{\an1}He could be suffering
right at this moment.

268
00:19:05,348 --> 00:19:07,149
Or even worse.

269
00:19:07,182 --> 00:19:08,817
-Just shut up!

270
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,186
{\an1}Don't want to hear any of
your pessimistic theories,

271
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:12,320
all right?

272
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:13,688
He's our master.

273
00:19:13,722 --> 00:19:17,559
{\an1}We're talking about Lord Killer
B. There's no way he'd lose.

274
00:19:17,592 --> 00:19:20,060
{\an1}-Aren't you worried about
Lord B at all, Karui?

275
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:21,829
-Being worried
doesn't mean I should

276
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:23,431
{\an1}rush to crazy conclusions!

277
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:24,499
{\an1}-Stop it, you two!

278
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,202
Listen.

279
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:30,871
We shall rescue
B, no matter what.

280
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:33,474
{\an1}We will save him.

281
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:34,475
-Lord Raikage.

282
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:41,781
-Ha!

283
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,049
{\an1}You have made great progress!

284
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,126
{\an1}Impressive jumping ability.

285
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,928
{\an1}Nice one, Naruto boy.

286
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:59,398
{\an1}Your Frog Kumite is
going quite well, too.

287
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,199
-Yeah.

288
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,668
{\an1}And that's not all I can do.

-Eh?

291
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,708
-I'm not done!

292
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:12,410
{\an1}I'm just getting started!

293
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:14,345
-Then come at me
with all you have.

{\an1}the Leaf Village.

297

{\an1}Cries of fear, people
fleeing in panic.

{\an1}Pillars of smoke arising
one after another.

Outclassed, the
Leaf's shinobi are

00:22:08,017 --> 00:22:09,951
engulfed by the
spiral of suffering

arrived.

00:22:27,336 --> 00:22:28,670
{\an1}How are you all doing?

308
00:22:28,704 --> 00:22:33,374
{\an1}Today I brought Neji, who hasn't
been in the show much lately.

309
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:35,009
{\an1}-What do you mean by that?

310
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:37,011
{\an1}That's only because
I'm almost always away

311
00:22:37,044 --> 00:22:37,945
{\an1}on important missions.

{\an1}The last time you were here
was a month-- no, s months.

314
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,451
Wait, how long?

315
00:22:43,484 --> 00:22:44,552
{\an1}-I don't remember.

316
00:22:44,585 --> 00:22:46,754
{\an1}It's not something I
do just to be noticed.

317
00:22:46,787 --> 00:22:48,088
-Oh, yeah?

318
00:22:48,121 --> 00:22:51,291
{\an1}Well, people sure did notice
Lee and Tenten last time.

319
00:22:51,324 --> 00:22:52,158
-What?

320
00:22:52,192 --> 00:22:54,661
{\an1}Why, those two-- Hmph.

321
00:22:54,694 --> 00:22:56,296
{\an1}They have free time
on their hands,

322
00:22:56,329 --> 00:22:57,996
{\an1}unlike a Jonin such as me.

323
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,832
-Right.

324
00:22:58,864 --> 00:23:00,767
{\an1}'Cause it's so tough being you.

325
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,601
Ha ha ha.

326
00:23:01,634 --> 00:23:02,901
-Damn you.

327
00:23:02,935 --> 00:23:04,804
{\an1}Hey, why don't you
come along with me

328
00:23:04,838 --> 00:23:06,805
{\an1}on my next mission, Naruto?

329
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,440
{\an1}We'll call it The
Neji Chronicles,

330
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:12,009
{\an1}and air it as a spectacular
one hour special.

331
00:23:12,043 --> 00:23:14,480
{\an1}-No way, ain't never
going to happen.

332
00:23:14,513 --> 00:23:16,314
{\an1}So everybody, please
continue to watch.

333
00:23:16,347 --> 00:23:19,183
But only my
adventures, ya got it?

334
00:23:19,217 --> 00:23:21,419
{\an1}-That is just not right!

335
00:23:21,452 --> 00:23:23,488
{\an1}I object, I object, I object!

336
00:23:23,521 --> 00:23:25,356
-Overruled!

337
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:25,456
