JIRAIYA: I'm coming in Tsunade.

00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:15,333
-Jiraiya, have you
learned anything?

5
00:00:15,366 --> 00:00:16,333
-I have.

6
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:18,466
I've located the
leader of the Akatsuki.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,500
-What?

8
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:20,466
You have?

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,900
Tell me everything!

10
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:24,800
-We can use this new information
to plan a surprise attack Lady

Tsunade.

-Now, now, don't be hasty.

13
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,233
-This isn't like plotting
a sequel to your novel.

14
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:32,566
We don't have any
time to waste here.

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,433
-But haste makes waste.

16
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:37,433
And we can't afford that,
especially not with the stakes

17
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:39,466
as high as they are now.

18
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,300
Listen, why don't we go
somewhere, just the two of us?

19
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,266
And grab a drink together?

20
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,866
I'll tell you everything I know.

00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:48,533
I am The Hokage.

00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:50,433
I can't go drink in
the middle of the day.

24

What about all the
ninja out there on duty?

25
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,133
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

Ah.

to pick up supplies?

get dark already.

When Jugo and
Suigetsu sleep I'll

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,206
make my move on Sasuke.
(LAUGHING) I'm so excited.

Oh.

This feeling--

-Kiba, what's the story?

40
00:03:34,273 --> 00:03:36,106
-Sasuke's scent is
faint and fading.

41
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,440
I need to concentrate.

42
00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:39,240
So shut up and stop
distracting me.

43
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,473
-Yep, they're coming, and fast.

One, two, their Chakra's
really strong too.

And there's quite a lot of them.

Not all of it human either.

00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:05,340
Dogs?

48
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:06,906
So they're tracking
us by our scent?

49
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:12,273
Is it the Akatsuki
or the Hidden Leaf?

-Jugo, I guess I better
go check on Karin.

-Wake up Sasuke.

We're about to have company.

Everyone get ready.

location of every Akatsuki

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,373
Sure you're OK Sasuke?

62
00:04:51,406 --> 00:04:54,373
-Yeah, ever since I
absorbed Orochimaru's power,

63
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:55,573
I heal faster.

64
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:58,573
(VOICEOVER) So this is the
power of the white snake.

65
00:04:58,606 --> 00:05:00,706
KARIN (VOICEOVER): Whether
it's the Akatsuki coming

66
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,573
or the Hidden Leaf, they
might have intel on Itachi.

67
00:05:03,606 --> 00:05:06,206
Why don't we just
ambush them, Sasuke?

68
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,740
-From what you've told me about
the number of people tracking

69
00:05:08,773 --> 00:05:11,606
us, if they're coming
in force, then it's

70
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,906
the Hidden Leaf Team
that you sensed.

71
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,906
The Akatsuki only
operate in two-man teams.

72
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,306
-And if that's the
case, then an ambush

73
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,906
would be a waste of our time.

74
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,406
-That's exactly right.

75
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,306
Just forget about
the Hidden Leaf.

76
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,673
-So what's the plan then?

77
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:28,873
-Itachi is our only priority.

78
00:05:28,906 --> 00:05:31,040
Then if worst comes
to worst, you three

79
00:05:31,073 --> 00:05:33,073
will stop the hidden leaf.

80
00:05:33,106 --> 00:05:35,240
For now, this is
team Heavy's mission.

81
00:05:35,273 --> 00:05:37,640
We're going to use the
intel that Jugo gathered.

82
00:05:37,673 --> 00:05:39,973
And we'll hit the Akatsuki
hideouts one by one.

83
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,573
-All right, sounds good.

84
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:42,373
-Let's do this.

85
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,406
-Hmm?

86
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,406
-Hold on Jugo, help me out.

87
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,740
-With what?

88
00:05:52,773 --> 00:05:55,506
-I need you to gather as
many birds as you can.

89
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,140
-Why?

90
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:57,273
What's your plan?

91
00:05:57,306 --> 00:05:59,906
-Well, this is one of
Sasuke's old outfits.

92
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,640
It's soaked with
his sweat and smell.

93
00:06:01,673 --> 00:06:02,773
So--

94
00:06:02,806 --> 00:06:04,140
-Wait, why did you hold
onto a sweaty old outfit

95
00:06:04,173 --> 00:06:05,873
that Sasuke threw away?

96
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:06,906
What?

97
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,206
That-- that's not
important right now.

98
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,673
Just-- just mind your
own business, you jerk.

99
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:13,506
So anyway, here.

100
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,473
(VOICEOVER) I hate to do this.

101
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:20,506
Sensory type specialties are
different for each village.

102
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,840
The Hidden Leaf tend to use
Ninja Hounds for tracking.

103
00:06:23,873 --> 00:06:25,306
We can use that
to our advantage.

104
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:31,040
-Kiba, what is it?

105
00:06:31,073 --> 00:06:32,040
-It's Sasuke.

106
00:06:32,073 --> 00:06:33,740
Shoot, looks like
he's on the move.

107
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:35,606
-Then we better hurry
and get after him.

108
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,840
He's going after Itachi.

109
00:06:37,873 --> 00:06:40,106
-Hold on, something's wrong.

110
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,240
-What?

111
00:06:41,273 --> 00:06:43,040
-Sasuke's scent is
becoming more diffuse now.

112
00:06:43,073 --> 00:06:45,206
It's like it's scattering
outward in every direction

113
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,506
all at the same time.

114
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,873
He's sensed our movements.

115
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:50,173
It's some kind of
strategic countermeasure.

116
00:06:50,206 --> 00:06:51,440
-He sensed us?

117
00:06:51,473 --> 00:06:52,840
But how?

118
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:54,740
-I don't know exactly.

119
00:06:54,773 --> 00:06:57,373
But I think it's safe to assume
that he has a skilled Sensory

120
00:06:57,406 --> 00:06:59,673
Ninja on his team.

121
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:01,173
-His scent is spreading too far.

122
00:07:01,206 --> 00:07:02,940
And our coms aren't long range.

123
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:04,406
I'm the only one
who can track it.

124
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,740
But I don't know
which scent to follow.

125
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:08,473
What do we do?

126
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:10,106
-I'm going to find
him, even if I

127
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,340
have to search every
blade of grass.

128
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:13,906
I'll do whatever it takes.

129
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,973
Just watch, Multi
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

130
00:07:25,206 --> 00:07:28,240
-It's just up ahead, huh?

131
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:30,940
You three will wait here
until I give the order.

132
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:31,940
I'll go check it out.

133
00:07:43,373 --> 00:07:46,640
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Who's that?

134
00:07:46,673 --> 00:07:49,306
Sharingan.

135
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:49,806
Sasuke?

136
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,140
No, that's-- Itachi Uchiha.

137
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:12,373
-Come on out, Naruto Uzumaki.

138
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:20,173
-You're here to capture me, huh?

139
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:22,440
-No, I'm not.

140
00:08:22,473 --> 00:08:25,473
Right now I'm only here
to talk to you, Naruto.

141
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,806
-Yeah, like I'd ever trust
what you have to say.

142
00:08:39,106 --> 00:08:40,506
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
When going up

143
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:45,140
against the Sharingan, if
it's one on one always run.

144
00:08:45,173 --> 00:08:49,273
If it's two on one,
attack from behind.

145
00:08:49,306 --> 00:08:52,206
This guy can cast a Genjutsu
with the same finger

146
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,406
he uses to make signs.

147
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,673
I've got to be careful.

148
00:08:57,706 --> 00:09:01,006
-I know that you're out
here all by yourself.

149
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,373
So why aren't you running?

150
00:09:02,406 --> 00:09:05,973
-Whatever, I can be any
number from 1 to 1,000.

151
00:09:06,006 --> 00:09:08,873
Besides, why would
I want to run?

152
00:09:08,906 --> 00:09:12,073
If I capture you then
I'll get to see Sasuke.

153
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:20,706
-Why are you so obsessed
with my brother?

154
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,873
He's just a Rogue Ninja.

155
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,612
-It's true that we
may not be blood,

156
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:33,045
but he's more of a brother to
me than you ever were to him.

157
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:52,245
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): You're
already under my Genjutsu.

[grunting]

159
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:04,179
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): I'll say
it again, I just want to talk.

160
00:10:06,712 --> 00:10:10,579
-So are you absolutely
certain the Akatsuki leader

161
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:12,412
is in the Hidden Rain Village?

162
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,679
-Yeah.

163
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:16,345
-That place conducts very
thorough checks of anyone

164
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:18,579
entering and exiting
their territory.

165
00:10:18,612 --> 00:10:21,445
And even keeps track
of how long they stay.

166
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:23,112
Just preparing for
the joint chunin

167
00:10:23,145 --> 00:10:25,645
exams is difficult each
year because that village

168
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,345
is so strict and insular.

169
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:29,912
Why would he pick that place?

170
00:10:29,945 --> 00:10:32,245
It just doesn't seem like
somewhere he could move around

171
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,245
very freely.

172
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,545
-That's true.

173
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:37,445
But that very insular
nature makes it ideal.

174
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:39,445
They're able to keep other
nations from learning

175
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:41,479
about their internal
affairs and cover up

176
00:10:41,512 --> 00:10:43,945
the shame of what's going on.

177
00:10:43,979 --> 00:10:45,712
-Shame?

178
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,245
-Apparently a civil war
has been raging there

179
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:52,545
for quite some time now and
has divided the village in two.

180
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:54,912
Word has it that the
leader of one of the sides

181
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:58,679
is the very Akatsuki leader
that we're talking about.

182
00:10:58,712 --> 00:11:01,479
-That tormented
land, it's surrounded

183
00:11:01,512 --> 00:11:04,345
by the three great nations
of Earth, Wind, and Fire.

184
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:07,145
It has often and long
been used as the staging

185
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:10,045
ground for all their battles.

186
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,379
There's never been
domestic stability there.

187
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:15,212
And the number of fleeing
refugees keeps rising.

188
00:11:15,245 --> 00:11:16,479
-Yes, that's right.

189
00:11:16,512 --> 00:11:19,679
And that's exactly why I
must infiltrate it and verify

190
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,545
the information I've gathered.

191
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:24,245
When I return, we'll
plan our strategy.

192
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:26,245
-It's too dangerous to go alone.

193
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,779
-I'm one of the Leaf's
legendary Sannin.

194
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:30,979
You know what that means
just as well as I do.

195
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:38,212
-I'm sorry, you
always seem to get

196
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:41,479
such unfortunate assignments.

197
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:43,345
[laughter]

198
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:45,279
-What's with the
sudden confession?

199
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:47,412
-I'm merely saying that
you were originally

200
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:49,612
supposed to become Hokage.

201
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:52,079
After all, the
third Hokage always

202
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:53,679
wanted you to succeed him.

203
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,945
-I'm not cut out for
that sort of thing.

204
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:57,912
I like being free
and unfettered.

205
00:11:57,945 --> 00:12:01,345
-You regretted not being
able to stop Orochimaru.

206
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:03,579
That's why you tracked
his movements by yourself

207
00:12:03,612 --> 00:12:05,212
for so long, isn't it?

208
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:12,179
-Well, I no longer
need to do that, do I?

209
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:15,045
That also means I get to
release the sequel to my novel

210
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:16,579
even sooner.

211
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:20,179
-Sometimes truth is stranger
than fiction, isn't it?

212
00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:22,412
I never imagined
Orochimaru would die.

213
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:29,445
Remember how the
three of us, we'd

214
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:31,745
go up against the third Hokage?

215
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:34,545
-And now, flat-as-a-board
Tsunade has become

216
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:35,912
the big-bosomed Hokage.

217
00:12:35,945 --> 00:12:39,079
Ah, times have changed
and always will.

218
00:12:39,112 --> 00:12:40,612
You were so beautiful back then.

219
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:43,845
And now, well, you're
a 50-something granny.

220
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,379
But does it pain
me to see how you

221
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:47,679
hold all the memories
of your lost friends

222
00:12:47,712 --> 00:12:50,945
and loved ones inside
that ample bosom of yours.

223
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,612
As you know, the number
will only continue to rise.

224
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:05,312
Well then, we'll just have to
keep our emotions in check.

225
00:13:05,345 --> 00:13:07,312
The job that we must
give to ourselves

226
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:10,545
now is to set examples and aid
the next generation Tsunade.

227
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:17,779
To achieve that, I'd
gladly risk my life.

228
00:13:17,812 --> 00:13:21,012
Wisdom is the one thing that
makes growing old worth it.

229
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:43,875
-What is this?

230
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:45,308
What's going on here?

231
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:47,875
I thought you said that
you weren't after me.

232
00:13:47,908 --> 00:13:49,842
Then why are you doing this?

233
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,608
-I'm going now.

234
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:54,742
I have an important
matter to attend to.

235
00:13:57,975 --> 00:14:03,442
A shadow clone, what
was that all about?

236
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,908
-Damn, no luck with
this scent either.

237
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:12,708
You OK Naruto?

238
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:13,942
-Huh?

239
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:16,708
Yeah.

240
00:14:16,742 --> 00:14:18,475
-Did something happen?

241
00:14:18,508 --> 00:14:21,208
No, I just tripped, that's all.

242
00:14:21,242 --> 00:14:22,342
Never mind that.

243
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,542
Kiba, get on the next scent.

244
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:29,975
[coughing]

245
00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:33,542
-Tsunade, wow, you're an
even worse drunk than I am.

246
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:36,708
Let's find someplace
where you can rest up.

247
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:37,508
-It's late.

248
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:38,442
We should go now.

249
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:40,275
CHILDREN: OK!

250
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:40,908
[sighs]

251
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:41,508
CHILDREN: Wait up!

252
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:48,142
The Akatsuki, if
it's leader can keep

253
00:14:48,175 --> 00:14:52,075
control of such a powerful
group, then how strong is he,

254
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:54,242
I wonder?

255
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:56,742
Jiraiya, this mission
of yours will take you

256
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:58,742
right into the lion's den.

257
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:03,708
-Well then, I think
I better get going.

258
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:05,175
-Please come back alive Jiraiya.

259
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:12,575
If I were to lose you too,
then I-- I don't know.

260
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:14,275
-Are you saying
you'd cry for me?

261
00:15:14,308 --> 00:15:16,508
I'm glad to hear it.

262
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:20,442
But I doubt it would be like
the time that Don died, right?

263
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:22,008
-You idiot.

264
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:26,375
-Say, how about
making a bet with me?

265
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:29,308
You gamble everything
on me dying.

266
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:31,542
After all, Tsunade, you
always lose your bets.

267
00:15:31,575 --> 00:15:32,942
Isn't that right?

268
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:39,175
Promise me, if I do actually
manage to make it back alive--

269
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,608
[laughter]

270
00:15:50,642 --> 00:15:53,175
-I'm only kidding Tsunade.

271
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,975
You know, I'm grateful to you.

272
00:15:57,742 --> 00:16:00,508
Rejection makes a man stronger.

273
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,175
I believe that you can't call
yourself a real man unless you

274
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:06,408
can laugh off all the bad
stuff that happens to you.

275
00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:10,442
Or at least use it
as writing material.

276
00:16:10,475 --> 00:16:13,308
-So a man's only
job is to be strong?

277
00:16:13,342 --> 00:16:15,042
-Kind of.

278
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,475
But that isn't the entire story.

279
00:16:17,508 --> 00:16:21,442
Basically, the pursuit of
happiness isn't for us.

280
00:16:21,475 --> 00:16:23,975
-Huh, stop trying
to act so cool.

281
00:16:24,008 --> 00:16:25,942
If there weren't any
women around there

282
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:27,775
would be no rejection either.

283
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:28,975
-Well, you have a point.

284
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:53,042
-If anything happens contact
me through your toad.

285
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:55,475
And I'll rush in
to help you myself.

286
00:16:55,508 --> 00:16:56,742
No need for that.

287
00:16:56,775 --> 00:16:59,642
You mustn't leave the village.

288
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:03,442
All of the Hidden Leaf is
relying on you right now.

289
00:17:03,475 --> 00:17:05,742
Plenty of others
could be Hokage.

290
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,408
-But there can be no
stability if the leadership

291
00:17:08,442 --> 00:17:10,208
keeps changing.

292
00:17:10,242 --> 00:17:13,042
And right now, there's no
better Hokage in the Hidden Leaf

293
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,808
Village than you Tsunade.

294
00:17:14,842 --> 00:17:18,542
-No, there's Kakashi and
well, eventually Naruto

295
00:17:18,575 --> 00:17:20,542
could become Hokage as well.

296
00:17:20,575 --> 00:17:23,408
-Uh-huh, boy, you really
are sold on Naruto.

297
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:23,975
Aren't you?

298
00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:30,142
Although I can see why.

299
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,542
Your kid brother, not lucky.

300
00:17:32,575 --> 00:17:33,642
Your boyfriend, Don.

301
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,808
I'll be Hokage.

302
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:40,808
That's my dream.

303
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:49,942
And Naruto too,
all three of them,

304
00:17:49,975 --> 00:17:53,208
chasing after the same dream.

305
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:56,008
So there's Kakashi
and Naruto, maybe.

306
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,542
You may have given
him your necklace.

307
00:17:57,575 --> 00:17:59,542
But he still has
a long way to go.

308
00:17:59,575 --> 00:18:01,008
-You believe in him too.

309
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:03,642
That's why you pushed him
so hard drive Jiraiya.

310
00:18:03,675 --> 00:18:06,008
I mean, you even taught
him the Rasengan.

311
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:06,975
[laughing]

312
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:09,175
-Just put it down to nostalgia.

313
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:12,675
He reminded of the days
when I taught Minato.

314
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:17,575
-Minato Namikaze,
Naruto's just like him.

315
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:21,942
-Minato was a
once-in-a-generation genius.

316
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,542
There won't be
another like him ever.

317
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:28,342
He was kind and gentle, yet
fierce and full of grit,

318
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,608
became the fourth Hokage
in the blink of an eye.

319
00:18:31,642 --> 00:18:34,042
Now, I've never been
a parent before.

320
00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:36,975
So I don't know all that much
about these kinds of things.

321
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:39,308
But if he'd been my
son, I'd be very proud.

322
00:18:39,342 --> 00:18:40,475
[laughing]

323
00:18:40,508 --> 00:18:43,075
-Now that you mention
it, Naruto might not

324
00:18:43,108 --> 00:18:44,708
be like him after all.

325
00:18:44,742 --> 00:18:47,075
He's not the kind of
child you boast about.

326
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:50,408
He's the one whose mischief
you always try to cover up.

327
00:18:50,442 --> 00:18:54,575
No, I would say, Naruto is
more like his mother was.

328
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:58,308
-Wasn't she a kunoichi
from the land of Eddies?

329
00:18:58,342 --> 00:19:02,508
That's right, his personality
is just like Kushina Uzumaki.

330
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:05,508
-That's right, I had
forgotten her name.

331
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:07,608
She was a chatty
red-haired little rascal.

332
00:19:07,642 --> 00:19:10,742
And was quite a
tomboy, as I remember.

333
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:11,908
-She was that.

334
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,608
But she grew up to
be a real beauty.

335
00:19:13,642 --> 00:19:16,408
But Naruto looks
more like his father.

336
00:19:16,442 --> 00:19:20,342
-Yeah, when I look at Naruto
I see a lot of his father.

337
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,375
Although to me,
it feels as if I'm

338
00:19:22,408 --> 00:19:25,308
looking at my very own grandson.

339
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:28,775
-It's being passed on,
the Will of the Leaf,

340
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:30,542
from past to future.

341
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:39,508
[gasps]

342
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:44,775
-Now, I really
ought to get going.

343
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,375
Oh, that's right.

344
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:54,975
I had one last warning.

345
00:19:55,008 --> 00:19:56,608
-What?

346
00:19:56,642 --> 00:19:59,775
-Beware of The
Foundation Tsunade.

347
00:19:59,808 --> 00:20:01,908
-Yes, I know.

348
00:20:01,942 --> 00:20:03,275
-Good.

349
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:09,575
Then-- See ya.

350
00:20:30,108 --> 00:20:31,575
[theme music]

351
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,910
-Anyone who's far
away, listen carefully.

352
00:22:05,943 --> 00:22:09,110
And anyone who's close,
come even closer and see.

353
00:22:09,143 --> 00:22:12,743
I am the sizzling handsome
ninja of the Hidden Leaf.

354
00:22:12,777 --> 00:22:15,643
I'm the one all the girls
cheer so wildly for.

355
00:22:15,677 --> 00:22:17,310
I'm smooth enough to
steal your hearts,

356
00:22:17,343 --> 00:22:19,643
but so strong I'll never break.

357
00:22:19,677 --> 00:22:21,810
I help the weak and
fight the strong.

358
00:22:21,843 --> 00:22:25,543
Now, let the tail of
Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls begin!

359
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,910
Next time, Tales
of a Gutsy Ninja,

360
00:22:27,943 --> 00:22:30,443
Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls, part one.

361
00:22:36,277 --> 00:22:38,077
-All right, today's guest--

362
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,477
-Now, just wait right there.

363
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,677
I am the most holy hermit sage
of the spirit of Mount Myoboku

364
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,010
Toads.

365
00:22:44,043 --> 00:22:46,943
Yes, I am the great, wise,
and powerful master, Jiraiya.

366
00:22:46,977 --> 00:22:47,877
-Oh great, it's you.

367
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,510
-What a greeting.

368
00:22:49,543 --> 00:22:51,277
Aren't you happy to see me?

369
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,243
-Well, it's not that.

370
00:22:52,277 --> 00:22:53,610
I just don't think
that we really

371
00:22:53,643 --> 00:22:55,010
have very much to talk about.

372
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:56,143
-Oh, don't say that.

373
00:22:56,177 --> 00:22:58,877
What about revisiting
all my heroic tales?

374
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,077
Heroic tales?

375
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,843
-They'll make all the
women shout with joy

376
00:23:01,877 --> 00:23:03,643
while they watch TV.

377
00:23:03,677 --> 00:23:06,277
-Like long ago, when you
peaked into the Hot Springs

378
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,510
and got busted?

379
00:23:07,543 --> 00:23:10,343
Or when the third Hokage
made you kneel for hours?

380
00:23:10,377 --> 00:23:12,910
Or that time you had a book
signing for your first novel

381
00:23:12,943 --> 00:23:17,177
and not one person bought
a copy or even showed up?

382
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:19,077
-Surely there must
be some others.

383
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,410
-Hmm, I can't think of one.

384
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,643
-That'll all I am
to you, isn't it?

385
00:23:23,677 --> 00:23:24,377
Just some joke?

386
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,210
-Oh--

387
00:23:25,243 --> 00:23:26,810
-That's it, tell them that one!

388
00:23:26,843 --> 00:23:28,343
-Sorry, our time's up now.

389
00:23:28,377 --> 00:23:30,310
So see you later.

390
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:32,610
-What the hell?
