1
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:05,988
W-Wait...

2
00:02:06,222 --> 00:02:08,888
{\an1}Are you completely
sure that he's an Uchiha?

3
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:10,021
Yes...

4
00:02:10,054 --> 00:02:13,420
{\an1}If he's found out
that you're Senju

5
00:02:13,453 --> 00:02:15,720
{\an1}.he'll pretend to let his
guard down in order to steal

6
00:02:15,754 --> 00:02:18,552
intel on us. Do
not trust him.

7
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:20,886
{\an1}No, he's not like that.

8
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,120
{\an1}You'd trust a member
of the clan who killed

9
00:02:23,153 --> 00:02:25,153
{\an1}your younger brother?

10
00:02:25,586 --> 00:02:29,418
{\an1}Just think about it! You
really don't have any idea

11
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:30,685
what he's been
thinking deep down inside!

12
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:34,351
{\an1}If he's been tricking you,
you're putting every single

13
00:02:34,385 --> 00:02:35,385
{\an1}Senju in danger!

14
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:36,550
That's not...

15
00:02:36,584 --> 00:02:39,951
{\an1}Tobirama and I will
come along, just in case.

16
00:02:40,617 --> 00:02:41,717
Understood?

17
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:43,050
Answer me!

18
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,917
Y-Yes.

19
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:25,645
{\an1}This is right off the bat,
but let's just skip stones

20
00:03:25,678 --> 00:03:26,878
{\an1}and forget greetings.

21
00:03:26,912 --> 00:03:29,178
Yeah...

22
00:03:43,809 --> 00:03:44,976
Hashirama...

23
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,676
{\an1}Sorry. I can't stay. I just
remembered I have

24
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,408
{\an1}something I have to do!

25
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:54,541
{\an1}Oh! Yeah, okay! I
guess I'm just gonna

26
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:56,209
{\an1}head on home, too, then.

27
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:57,674
<i>Run!?</i>

28
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:00,041
<i>Scram?!</i>

29
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:05,374
{\an1}He's too fast. He's
planning to escape!

30
00:04:05,406 --> 00:04:07,706
Damn it!
Hashirama's warned him!

31
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,207
{\an1}Let's go, Tobirama!

32
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,007
Yes, sir!

33
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,140
[gasp]

34
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:24,205
{\an1}It seems we're both on the
same page, Butsuma Senju.

35
00:04:24,238 --> 00:04:26,671
{\an1}And Tobirama, I believe.

36
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:29,671
Indeed, you're
correct, Tajima Uchiha.

37
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,870
And you're
Izuna, aren't you?

38
00:04:37,104 --> 00:04:39,370
It seemed the
Uchia coincidentally

39
00:04:39,402 --> 00:04:41,569
{\an1}had the same idea.

40
00:04:41,602 --> 00:04:43,736
{\an1}Exactly identical
circumstances.

41
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:48,335
{\an1}Both Butsuma Senju and
Tajima Uchiha knew from

42
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:50,668
{\an1}numerous prior clashes
that they possessed

43
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:52,534
{\an1}practically equal strength.

44
00:04:58,001 --> 00:04:59,634
No, stop it!

45
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:04,133
{\an1}Shinobi are trained to keep
their hearts in check on the

46
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,699
battlefield, no
matter what happens.

47
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,799
{\an1}A single flash of
emotional disarray can

48
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,266
{\an1}lead to vulnerability
and mean the difference

49
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:13,366
{\an1}between life and death.

50
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:15,531
However...

51
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,698
The two adults
were well aware

52
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:21,064
{\an1}that if their children
were killed right before

53
00:05:21,098 --> 00:05:24,430
{\an1}their eyes, it would likely,
no matter how slight,

54
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:26,697
{\an1}unbalance their heart.

55
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:29,063
{\an1}Meaning that whichever
one could land the

56
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:31,730
{\an1}first strike would
determine the outcome.

57
00:05:33,897 --> 00:05:35,197
[gasp]

58
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:52,760
{\an1}I won't forgive anyone who
hurts my brother, no matter

59
00:05:52,793 --> 00:05:54,160
who they are!!

60
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,960
{\an1}And the same goes for me!

61
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,226
{\an1}Hey, Hashirama...

62
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:03,193
What is it?

63
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:05,792
{\an1}Maybe all those plans
we made together...

64
00:06:08,026 --> 00:06:09,026
were just...

65
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,424
{\an1}A pipe dream of ours...

66
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,092
{\an1}Madara, What are--?!

67
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:21,523
{\an1}It might have been brief,
but it was fun, Hashirama.

68
00:06:23,057 --> 00:06:25,258
{\an1}Three against three...

69
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,623
{\an1}Madara, think we
can take them?

70
00:06:27,656 --> 00:06:31,123
No, Hashirama is
stronger than me.

71
00:06:31,156 --> 00:06:32,389
If we fight,
then we'll lose.

72
00:06:32,422 --> 00:06:35,022
There's a kid
stronger than you, Brother?

73
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:38,356
{\an1}I see. Quite impressive.

74
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:40,222
Let's retreat.

75
00:06:40,256 --> 00:06:41,655
Later.

76
00:06:41,688 --> 00:06:43,121
Madara!

77
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:47,321
{\an1}But you haven't really
given up on it, have you?

78
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:50,288
{\an1}You've just gotten
to the same point I-

79
00:06:50,321 --> 00:06:50,753
You are Senju.

80
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:52,853
[gasp]

81
00:06:52,887 --> 00:06:55,686
{\an1}I truly wish it wasn't so.

82
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,752
The Senju
killed my brothers.

83
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,585
{\an1}And the Uchiha...
your brothers.

84
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:08,285
{\an1}That's why there's
no need to show each

85
00:07:08,318 --> 00:07:11,185
{\an1}other what's inside of us.

86
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:13,684
{\an1}Our next meeting
will likely be on the

87
00:07:13,718 --> 00:07:16,750
battlefield,
Hashirama Senju.

88
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,416
For I...

89
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,550
{\an1}...am Madara Uchiha!

90
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,316
{\an1}Hey, look, Father!
Big Brother's eyes!

91
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,049
[chuckle]

92
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,849
{\an1}We may not have gained
intel on the Senju...

93
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:32,249
But it seems we
obtained something

94
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:33,848
{\an1}valuable after all.

95
00:07:34,514 --> 00:07:38,648
{\an1}His Sharingan was
awakened just now?!

96
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,380
{\an1}In that moment, I felt
like I understood what

97
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:47,780
{\an1}awakening the Sharingan
truly signified.

98
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:58,511
{\an1}He decided to completely
erase his friend, to

99
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,578
{\an1}erase me from his life.

100
00:08:04,045 --> 00:08:06,844
After that we
battled. We fought each

101
00:08:06,878 --> 00:08:08,811
{\an1}other day after day.

102
00:08:09,377 --> 00:08:12,311
{\an1}And before we knew it,
we'd each become our

103
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:14,310
{\an1}respective clan's leaders.

104
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:24,609
{\an1}We were at the furthest
place possible from the

105
00:08:24,642 --> 00:08:27,142
dream that we'd
wanted to fulfill.

106
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,771
[gasp]

107
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:02,504
Fire Style!
Fire Ball Jutsu!

108
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:05,637
Water Style!
Water Dragon Jutsu!

109
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:09,037
[roar]

110
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:22,468
{\an1}<i>A blind attack! I curse</i>
<i>the misfortune of those</i>

111
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:24,169
{\an1}<i>who lack the Sharingan.</i>

112
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:28,235
{\an1}Flying Raijin Slice!

113
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:31,734
[wet cough]

114
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:35,400
Izuna!

115
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:39,733
{\an1}Hang in there! I
won't let you die!

116
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:54,865
Hashirama...

117
00:09:56,198 --> 00:09:59,031
{\an1}Madara. You cannot
win against me...

118
00:10:00,864 --> 00:10:03,597
But I had never
abandoned our dream.

119
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:07,630
[gasp]

120
00:10:09,362 --> 00:10:11,429
{\an1}Why don't we end this?

121
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:15,963
{\an1}If the two strongest
clans, the Uchiha and

122
00:10:15,996 --> 00:10:18,195
{\an1}Senju, join together.

123
00:10:18,229 --> 00:10:21,162
{\an1}Nations couldn't find clans
able to stand against us!

124
00:10:21,195 --> 00:10:23,728
{\an1}The conflict will
eventually die down.

125
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:26,861
Here...

126
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:45,425
{\an1}No, Big Brother!

127
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,859
Izuna!

128
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:50,724
Don't let them
deceive you...

129
00:10:51,524 --> 00:10:53,058
Izuna!

130
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:58,058
{\an1}Did you forget they killed
everyone! Killed us Uchiha?

131
00:11:36,686 --> 00:11:39,985
{\an1}It was clear to all that
the Uchiha Clan was in an

132
00:11:40,018 --> 00:11:42,651
{\an1}unfavorable position.

133
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:46,551
{\an1}In fact, defectors to the
Senju soon began showing up.

134
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:50,184
{\an1}And that's about the time
when Madara changed as well.

135
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:08,615
{\an1}He had obtained the
Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan.

136
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,913
Those eyes...

137
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:24,513
{\an1}And what of Izuna?

138
00:12:24,546 --> 00:12:28,413
{\an1}He succumbed to the wounds
he received that day....

139
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:30,879
Leaving me with
powers that'll help

140
00:12:30,912 --> 00:12:32,478
{\an1}protect the Uchiha!

141
00:12:32,512 --> 00:12:35,612
{\an1}I have sent you a
cease-fire agreement.

142
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:38,245
To protect the
Uchiha, the best way

143
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:40,278
{\an1}is to stop fighting!

144
00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:47,244
Hashirama!

145
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:57,109
Wood Style,
Deep Forest Bloom!

146
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:32,772
{\an1}Poisonous pollen, huh?

147
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:35,139
{\an1}Enough, Madara!

148
00:13:35,172 --> 00:13:37,404
{\an1}All this fighting
is meaningless!

149
00:13:38,337 --> 00:13:40,305
{\an1}Meaningless, is it?

150
00:13:40,337 --> 00:13:43,970
{\an1}Then tell me why
Izuna is dead now!

151
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:46,237
{\an1}Fine, I will tell you!

152
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,770
{\an1}It is because you
bastards killed him!

153
00:14:01,434 --> 00:14:02,334
[gasp]

154
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,067
{\an1}Wood Golem Jutsu!

155
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:41,231
Hashirama!

00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:46,096
{\an1}[attacking yell]

157
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:54,321
Madara, at one
time, we were friends!

158
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:57,854
We both shared
the same dream!

159
00:16:00,654 --> 00:16:03,520
{\an1}Hashirama! How long
will you keep saying

160
00:16:03,554 --> 00:16:05,352
{\an1}such childish things?

161
00:16:15,985 --> 00:16:18,019
{\an1}It is not possible
to show each other

162
00:16:18,052 --> 00:16:19,618
{\an1}what is inside of us!

163
00:16:19,652 --> 00:16:22,517
{\an1}Do you really not get it?

164
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:28,384
Hashirama!

165
00:16:28,684 --> 00:16:30,750
Madara!

166
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:50,414
{\an1}At the end of a battle that
lasted a whole day, Madara's

167
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:53,880
{\an1}back touched the ground
for the very first time.

168
00:17:05,946 --> 00:17:07,146
Madara...

169
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,779
{\an1}You're finished.

170
00:17:08,813 --> 00:17:13,012
{\an1}Wait, Tobirama.

171
00:17:14,945 --> 00:17:16,578
{\an1}Why, Elder Brother?!

172
00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:18,577
{\an1}This is our chance!

173
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,744
{\an1}No one touches him!

174
00:17:21,777 --> 00:17:23,111
[chuckle]

175
00:17:23,144 --> 00:17:27,442
Just get it all
over with, Hashirama.

176
00:17:28,476 --> 00:17:32,476
{\an1}It would be an honor
to die by your hand.

177
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:36,176
{\an1}Stop posturing. If I
kill the clan leader of the

178
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:38,675
Uchiha, it will
only incite the young

179
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:39,809
{\an1}ones who follow you.

180
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:44,674
{\an1}No one among the Uchiha has
such nerve. Not anymore.

181
00:17:44,707 --> 00:17:47,374
No, there is
always someone.

182
00:17:47,407 --> 00:17:50,108
Perhaps not
right now, but in time.

183
00:17:50,141 --> 00:17:54,940
{\an1}C'mon, why don't we
put an end to this war?

184
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:55,740
{\an1}We made a promise,
remember?

185
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:58,140
{\an1}To create an ideal
village someday.

186
00:18:01,405 --> 00:18:05,372
{\an1}Can't we just skip stones
like we did in the old days?

187
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:07,072
Madara?

188
00:18:07,106 --> 00:18:10,272
No, that's not
possible anymore.

189
00:18:10,304 --> 00:18:13,938
{\an1}You and I are no
longer the same people.

190
00:18:13,971 --> 00:18:16,470
Let's build our
settlement right here!

191
00:18:16,503 --> 00:18:19,470
{\an1}[chuckling] You do
realize it's only you

192
00:18:19,503 --> 00:18:21,104
{\an1}spouting such nonsense.

193
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:23,804
{\an1}Yeah? What about you?!

194
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:24,702
All right!

195
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:27,069
{\an1}If that settlement
is built, then that

196
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:28,702
{\an1}would mean that...

197
00:18:28,736 --> 00:18:31,302
{\an1}I could protect my brother
here, from this boundless

198
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:33,235
vantage point!

199
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:38,568
{\an1}I have no brothers left.
Nothing remains to protect.

200
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:42,467
{\an1}And in all honestly,
I just can not bring

201
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,067
{\an1}myself to trust you.

202
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:49,067
{\an1}But isn't there any
way I can convince you?

203
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:57,167
{\an1}Well, there is a way to
show each other what is

204
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,765
inside of us...

205
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,932
{\an1}Either kill your brother...

206
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:04,099
{\an1}Or kill yourself right now.

207
00:19:04,132 --> 00:19:07,464
{\an1}And then we shall be
even. I would even be

208
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:08,864
{\an1}willing to trust your clan.

209
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:12,064
{\an1}Do what?! Kill your little
brother or kill yourself?!

210
00:19:12,098 --> 00:19:15,097
You dare say
such an outlandish-

211
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,396
Yes, I agree.

212
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:18,396
What you're
saying's insane.

213
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:22,230
{\an1}So what now, Elder Brother?
Are you going to kill me?

214
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:25,729
{\an1}Or are you going to die on
account of his nonsense?

215
00:19:25,762 --> 00:19:29,062
{\an1}It's idiotic! Don't
bother listening!

216
00:19:33,427 --> 00:19:36,728
I thank you,
Madara. It seems you

217
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:38,327
{\an1}really are kindhearted.

218
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,560
{\an1}<i>Madara had given me a</i>
<i>choice, an option where I</i>

219
00:19:43,593 --> 00:19:45,927
{\an1}<i>wouldn't have to kill</i>
<i>my little brother.</i>

220
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,226
{\an1}<i>He knew all too well</i>
<i>how an older brother feels</i>

221
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,026
{\an1}<i>toward his younger siblings.</i>

222
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:55,492
{\an1}Listen, Tobirama please
carve into your heart

223
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:57,858
{\an1}these final words of mine.

224
00:19:57,892 --> 00:19:59,424
Brother!

225
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,758
{\an1}Words that I shall be
exchanging with my life.

226
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:05,457
You, too, my
fellow clan members!

227
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,757
{\an1}After my death, you
must not kill Madara!

228
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:12,589
{\an1}I forbid fighting between
the Uchiha and Senju.

229
00:20:12,623 --> 00:20:15,356
{\an1}Swear this right now
upon our fathers and

230
00:20:15,389 --> 00:20:17,489
{\an1}yet unborn grandchildren!

231
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:22,089
Farewell!

232
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,584
That is enough.

233
00:20:55,018 --> 00:20:58,351
You've shown me
what is inside you.

234
00:21:01,118 --> 00:21:06,151
{\an1}It was like a dream Uchiha
and Senju had joined forces.

235
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:09,283
{\an1}There would no longer
be mass casualties,

236
00:21:09,316 --> 00:21:12,116
{\an1}nor would any more
children have to die.

237
00:21:14,783 --> 00:21:19,515
{\an1}And so, at last we began
building our village.

238
00:22:57,603 --> 00:23:00,036
{\an1}<i>Do you remember how</i>
<i>we used to talk here</i>

239
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,237
{\an1}<i>when we were brats?</i>

240
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:04,536
<i>Yeah, to be</i>
<i>honest, I thought we</i>

241
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:05,536
{\an1}<i>were only dreaming.</i>

242
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:08,769
<i>That dream's now</i>
<i>becoming reality.</i>

243
00:23:08,802 --> 00:23:10,401
{\an1}<i>There's no time to</i>
<i>get weak-kneed now!</i>

244
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:14,434
{\an1}<i>We're going to need to find</i>
<i>a name for the village! </i>

245
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:15,701
<i>You have any</i>
<i>thoughts on that?</i>

246
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:19,567
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "My True Dream."</i>

247
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:23,967
{\an1}<i>How about the Village</i>
<i>Hidden in the Leaves?</i>
