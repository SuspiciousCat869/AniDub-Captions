this awful rain.

-I'm only kidding, Tsunade.

You know, I'm grateful to you.

-I'm sure master Jiraiya's fine.

He of all people wouldn't--

00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:18,469
-He's not coming back.

8
00:02:21,236 --> 00:02:25,269
That's what I bet
him before he left.

9
00:02:25,302 --> 00:02:29,436
Because he knows I never
win any of my bets.

JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Rejection
makes a man stronger,

12
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:50,402
but that isn't the entire story.

13
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:54,069
Basically, the pursuit of
happiness isn't for us.

-Always trying to be cool.

15
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,136
Well, when he gets back, I won't
let him keep this cool anymore.

16
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:14,636
-Pain, tell me already--
just what the hell are you?

17
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:18,302
PAIN: Pain-- that is
a designation that

18
00:03:18,336 --> 00:03:20,469
refers to the six
of us as a group.

19

You're-- I know that face.

Is that you, Yahiko?

22
00:03:31,436 --> 00:03:32,502
-Ah, yes.

23
00:03:32,536 --> 00:03:34,769
There was such a fellow
once, wasn't there?

24
00:03:34,802 --> 00:03:38,036
But he died a long time ago.

25
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:39,902
-Just what is going on here?

26
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:41,369
You said that Yahiko died.

27
00:03:41,402 --> 00:03:43,336
And those eyes.

28
00:03:43,369 --> 00:03:46,369
PAIN: You see Yahiko's
image when you look at me?

29
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:49,369
You really are his
former teacher.

30
00:03:49,402 --> 00:03:52,536
But Yahiko's been dead
for quite some time.

31
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:55,402
All that remains is Pain.

32
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,336
-Look, just quit the wordplay.

33
00:03:57,369 --> 00:03:59,602
Tell me why you
possess the Rinnegan.

34
00:03:59,636 --> 00:04:02,269
-What are you talking
about, Jiraiya, boy?

35
00:04:02,302 --> 00:04:05,402
-One of my former students
is now among the six.

36
00:04:05,436 --> 00:04:08,236
But he didn't possess eyes like
that back when I taugh him.

37
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:10,769
-What in tarnation's
going on then?

38
00:04:10,802 --> 00:04:14,436
Are you telling us that there
are two children of prophecy?

39
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:16,602
-No, that not it, either.

40
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:19,302
When I saw the Rinnegan,
I convinced myself

41
00:04:19,336 --> 00:04:21,536
that the first one
with it was Nagato.

42
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:24,736
But he's slightly different
from the Nagato I knew.

43
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:28,802
Come to think of it, upon closer
inspection, none of those six

44
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:31,536
really remind me of
Nagato all that much.

45
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:35,602
On the other hand, one of
them does resemble Yahiko.

46
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:38,469
But he possesses
Nagato's Rinnegan.

47
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:42,636
Are you Yahiko or
are you Nagato?

48
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:45,036
So just what exactly are you?

49
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:46,502
-We are Pain.

50
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,002
That's all.

51
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:50,669
We are god.

JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): A god?

54
00:05:07,736 --> 00:05:12,369
-Yahiko, how is it possible
you possess Nagato's eyes?

55
00:05:12,402 --> 00:05:15,869
-Even if you knew, even
if I told you, you'd lose.

- Lad just give up already.

57
00:05:26,236 --> 00:05:28,736
-I must find a way to
defeat them, even if I die.

58
00:05:47,602 --> 00:05:48,869
-I don't sense his presence.

59
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:59,169
Is this a barrier?

-Yes, you did it, Jiraiya, boy.

SHIMA: Is he dead?

64
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,974
JIRAIYA: I barely managed
to kill one, and only

65
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:44,574
after dragging him
into my barrier.

-Are you all right, lad?

-Yeah, kinda.

70
00:07:02,707 --> 00:07:03,174
There.

71
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,740
Their identity is a
completely mystery.

72
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:11,740
And they seem to use
off weapons, too.

SHIMA: They're no
longer mortals.

74

else completely.

-No one's ever
seen him up close.

77

And some people
even go so far as

78
00:07:23,474 --> 00:07:25,874
to claim that he
doesn't really exist.

79
00:07:25,907 --> 00:07:28,107
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
But that face.

80
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,507
There's no mistaking it.

81
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,474
He's Yahiko.

82
00:07:34,374 --> 00:07:38,807
And yet he possesses
Nagato's Rinnegan.

83
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,840
Did Yahiko for some reason
steal them from Nagato?

84
00:07:42,874 --> 00:07:46,840
But even if he did, there are
those other Rinnegan bearers,

85
00:07:46,874 --> 00:07:48,574
as well.

86
00:07:48,607 --> 00:07:52,174

88
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,007
-But it is because one
understands such pain

89
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,007
that generosity towards
others becomes second nature.

That's what makes us human.

-I don't-- what do you mean?

92
00:08:06,507 --> 00:08:10,040
-It's a process
called growing up.

93

-It's called growing up?

94

I still don't get it.

95
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:16,340
JIRAIYA: It's about being
able to think and make

96
00:08:16,374 --> 00:08:18,140
your own decisions.

97
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:20,640
PAIN: Too many people
died in this land.

98
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:25,874
All that Pain forced
me to grow up.

99
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:29,907
-In which case, does that
mean he's Nagato after all?

100
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:45,840
-That's right.

101
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:47,174
Now I remember.

102
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:49,740
He's definitely not Nagato.

103
00:08:49,774 --> 00:08:51,207
-What's wrong?

104
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,074
-This man in front of us, I've
also battled him once before.

He was a Fuma clan member
I encountered right

106
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:03,540
after I set out on my journey,
following the Great Lord

107
00:09:03,574 --> 00:09:05,140
Elder's prophecy.

108
00:09:05,174 --> 00:09:08,307
I gave him that scar
on his forehead.

109
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,307
-So why is such a fellow
here in this place, then?

110
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:16,907
-Now I'm more confused than ever
about this whole Pain mystery.

111
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,740
-You'll be the one to guide
this revolutionary change.

112
00:09:20,774 --> 00:09:23,007
And eventually,
there will come a day

113
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,407
when you'll be forced to
make a critical selection.

114
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,074
JIRAIYA: What must I do in order
to make the correct choice?

115
00:09:31,107 --> 00:09:34,274
-In my dream, I see you
traveling around the world

116
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,174
and also writing books.

117
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:37,574
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
It can't be.

118
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:40,574
If this is the prophecy--

119
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,674
JIRAIYA: I want to go back
and face them in order

120
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,174
to confirm a suspicion of mine.

121
00:09:45,207 --> 00:09:47,407
But the two of you
need to go home now.

122
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,474
-What's that?

123
00:09:48,507 --> 00:09:49,474
-Absolutely not.

124
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:51,874
You'll be killed if
you go back there.

125
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:53,674
They have more eyes now.

126
00:09:53,707 --> 00:09:55,240
And that barrier
trap is never going

127
00:09:55,274 --> 00:09:57,774
to work on them a second
time, that's for sure.

128
00:09:57,807 --> 00:09:59,174
They're not onto us yet.

129
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:01,174
They don't even know
that we're here.

130
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:03,007
This is our only chance to run.

131
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,807
-I know that I might very well
be killed if I go out there.

132
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,774
But I also may be able to deduce
our enemies' true identity.

133
00:10:11,807 --> 00:10:14,174
If I let this chance
slip by, I don't

134
00:10:14,207 --> 00:10:17,574
think there's anyone else who
could get as close to Pain.

135
00:10:17,607 --> 00:10:21,440
This is our only chance
to uncover the truth.

136
00:10:21,474 --> 00:10:24,940
Plus, this is the
time for selection

137
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:27,974
that the Great Lord
Elder prophesized for me.

138

Boss, you an Ma please
take back the intel on Pain

And please tell Tsunade I--

handle all that stuff.

back by dinner time.

-Yeah.

When we're all done here,
I'll bring Jiraiya boy

00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:30,764
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
It's no good.

161
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:32,597
My throat was crushed
by that attack.

162
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:36,464
Damn it.

163
00:12:36,497 --> 00:12:42,664
At this rate, it's useless.

164
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:45,497
I'm passing out.

165
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:49,831
Am I really going to die now?

166
00:12:49,864 --> 00:12:52,764
Have I failed?

167
00:13:06,864 --> 00:13:12,597
In the shinobi world, it's not
how you live, it's how you die.

168
00:13:12,631 --> 00:13:16,831
A shinobi's life is not
measured by how they live,

169
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,897
but rather it's measured
by what they manage

170
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,731
to accomplish
before their death.

171
00:13:21,764 --> 00:13:26,131
And looking back, my life has
really been full of nothing

172
00:13:26,164 --> 00:13:30,597
but failure-- continually
rejected by Tsunade,

173
00:13:30,631 --> 00:13:34,364
unable to stop my friend,
and unable to protect

174
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:38,597
either my student or my mentor.

175
00:13:38,631 --> 00:13:42,597
Compared to the great and
celebrated deeds of the Hokage,

176
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:47,631
my actions are trifling,
insignificant things indeed.

177
00:13:47,664 --> 00:13:52,064
I wish that I could have
died like each of the Hokage.

178
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:56,731
A tale is only as good as its
final turn of events-- the plot

179
00:13:56,764 --> 00:13:58,397
twist.

180
00:13:58,431 --> 00:14:01,897
And the stakes are an important
part of the plot, too.

181
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:04,064
I've lived my life
always believing

182
00:14:04,097 --> 00:14:07,264
that the lessons I've
learned are what honed me.

183
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:10,531
I swore I'd accomplish
a deed so great that it

184
00:14:10,564 --> 00:14:12,397
would obliterate
all my failures.

185
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:16,364
I'd die a splendid shinobi.

186
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,897
At least, that's how
it was supposed to go.

187
00:14:18,931 --> 00:14:24,997
But this-- my plot twist,
my tale ending like this?

188
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:28,497
The Great Lord Elder prophesized
that I would be the one

189
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:30,864
to guide a revolution,
a person who

190
00:14:30,897 --> 00:14:33,597
will make a great choice
that will bring either peace

191
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:37,364
or destruction to the
world of the shinobi.

192
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:41,164
I thought I would defeat
Pain, stop the Akatsuki,

193
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:43,831
and save the world
from destruction.

194
00:14:43,864 --> 00:14:48,364
But in the end, I
failed that, too.

195
00:14:48,397 --> 00:14:52,564
How pitiful, how sad, that
this will be the ending twist

196
00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:55,631
to the tale of
Jiraiya the gallant.

197
00:14:55,664 --> 00:14:59,364
What a worthless story
it turned out to be.

198
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:00,331
-Oh, no.

199
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:01,964
I don't believe that at all.

200
00:15:01,997 --> 00:15:04,397
I think that this
tale is wonderful.

201
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:07,197
Every chapter reads like one of
the numerous legendary exploits

202
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:08,631
you told me about.

203
00:15:08,664 --> 00:15:11,097
It's like it's almost
autobiographical.

204
00:15:11,131 --> 00:15:14,664
The main character in here, I
thought that his determination

205
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:16,964
to never give up
was pretty awesome.

206
00:15:16,997 --> 00:15:19,497
He's actually quite a
lot like you, sensei.

207
00:15:19,531 --> 00:15:20,764
-Yeah?

208
00:15:20,797 --> 00:15:22,164
You think so?

209
00:15:22,197 --> 00:15:26,731
-So I was thinking-- I really
hope my soon-to-be-born child

210
00:15:26,764 --> 00:15:29,431
can become an amazing shinobi,
be just like the main character

211
00:15:29,464 --> 00:15:30,731
in your book.

212
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,797
So that's why I'd like
to ask your permission

213
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:36,164
to name my son after him.

214
00:15:36,197 --> 00:15:37,497
-You what?

215
00:15:37,531 --> 00:15:39,164
Are you sure about this?

216
00:15:39,197 --> 00:15:41,864
I mean, I randomly came up
with it while eating ramen.

217
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:42,864
KUSHINA UZUMAKI: Naruto.

218
00:15:46,031 --> 00:15:47,431
I think it's a wonderful name.

219
00:15:51,164 --> 00:15:51,631
-Kushina.

220
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:56,731
Wow.

221
00:15:56,764 --> 00:15:59,097
So would that make me
his godfarther then?

222
00:15:59,131 --> 00:16:02,064
Are you really sure
you're sure about this?

223
00:16:02,097 --> 00:16:04,497
-You are my sensei, Jiraiya.

224
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:07,497
You are a great ninja who
possesses true talent.

225
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:09,664
There's no one else like
you in the whole world.

[music playing]

227
00:16:11,131 --> 00:16:13,031
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Yes.

228
00:16:13,064 --> 00:16:14,497
That's right.

229
00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:15,897
I gave that child--

230
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:20,897
-Someday I'm going
to be a Hokage

231
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:22,897
and you'll look up to me!

232
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:25,431
My name's Naruto Uzumaki.

233
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:28,031
Remember it!

234
00:16:28,064 --> 00:16:28,864
No way.

235
00:16:28,897 --> 00:16:31,364
I never go back on my word.

236
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:32,764
That's the way of the ninja.

237
00:16:36,531 --> 00:16:38,897
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

238
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,464
Now that I think
about it, you're

239
00:16:41,497 --> 00:16:44,731
just like that novel's
main character.

240
00:16:44,764 --> 00:16:49,197
You've inherited Minato and
Kushina's wishes, their hopes.

241
00:16:49,231 --> 00:16:54,397
And yet-- and yet I--

242
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,131
-You are my sensei, Jiraiya.

243
00:16:56,164 --> 00:16:58,797
You are a great ninja who
possesses true talent.

244
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:00,797
There's no one else like
you in the whole world.

245

-A real ninja is one
who endures no matter

246

what gets thrown at him.

247
00:17:07,964 --> 00:17:10,397
Let me explain something to you.

248
00:17:10,431 --> 00:17:14,264
There's only one thing that
matters if you're a shinobi,

249
00:17:14,297 --> 00:17:17,431
and it isn't the number
of jutsu you possess.

250
00:17:17,464 --> 00:17:24,097
All you do need is the
guts to never give up!

251
00:17:24,131 --> 00:17:27,864
Never going back on
your word no matter what

252
00:17:27,897 --> 00:17:30,397
and never giving up
despite what the odds may

253
00:17:30,431 --> 00:17:35,464
tell you to do-- Naruto, if
that is truly your ninja way,

254
00:17:35,497 --> 00:17:40,131
then as your teacher, I have
no business at all whining.

255
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:43,164
Because as everyone
knows, a student

256
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:46,831
inherits his ninja
way from his teacher.

257
00:17:46,864 --> 00:17:49,031
Right, Naruto?

258
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:51,497
Isn't that so?

259
00:17:51,531 --> 00:17:54,197
-He fought his way back
by sheer will alone?

260
00:17:56,964 --> 00:17:57,597
Jiraiya, boy!

261
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:06,683
-I was certain that
his heart had stopped.

262
00:18:06,716 --> 00:18:07,183
-Right.

263
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,883
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Never
give up no matter what.

264
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:24,216
That was the true choice
that I was supposed to make.

265
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,450
-Obstinate, isn't he?

266
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:29,750
Let's finish him.

267
00:18:29,783 --> 00:18:31,116
-All right.

-A dying message.

He wrote it in code.

271
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:45,416
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Naruto,
you are the child of prophecy.

272
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,916
I'm sure of it now.

273
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,216
I leave the rest to you.

274
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:05,650
-That frog-- the frog got away.

275

JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): The
tale of Jiraiya the gallant.

276
00:19:14,816 --> 00:19:18,816
Well, now it'll end
a bit better, I hope.

277
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:25,283
The final chapter-- I'll call it
"Frog at the Bottom of the Well

Drifts off into
the Great Ocean."

Just barely glorious,
but glorious indeed.

280
00:19:35,016 --> 00:19:41,183
Now, I suppose it's about
time I put down by pen.

281
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:43,916
Oh, that's right.

282
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,783
What should I name
the sequel, I wonder?

haven't changed at all.

But I'm no longer
the same as before.

I hold for you in my heart
