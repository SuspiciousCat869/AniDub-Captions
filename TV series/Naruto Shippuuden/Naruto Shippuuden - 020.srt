1
00:00:11,648 --> 00:00:13,851
-Sakura, do not fear.

2
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:19,458
I am here with you.

3
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:21,360
You just step back now, dear.

4
00:00:28,636 --> 00:00:29,203
Assault Blade!

5
00:00:42,787 --> 00:00:48,260
-If you insist on defying
me, you leave me no choice.

6
00:00:48,294 --> 00:00:52,666
So, are you ready to join
that boy as another addition

7
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:54,669
to my collection, Granny Chiyo?

8
00:01:03,112 --> 00:01:04,547
-What-- what is that thing?

9
00:01:09,254 --> 00:01:13,326
-What you see there is
not Sasori's real body.

10
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,228
-I kind of guessed it
wasn't his real body.

11
00:01:16,262 --> 00:01:18,098
What is it, then?

12
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:19,566
-Ah.

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,771
That's merely a puppet.

14
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:28,645
-But then, where
is his real body?

15
00:01:28,678 --> 00:01:30,513
A puppet master has to
be pulling the strings

16
00:01:30,547 --> 00:01:32,817
from somewhere, right?

17
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,286
-His real body is
insight that one.

18
00:01:38,023 --> 00:01:39,658
-Inside?

19
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:43,396
-Puppet masters aren't
so good at close combat.

20
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:45,799
Manipulating their
puppet during battle

21
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:50,205
leaves them wide open to attack.

22
00:01:50,238 --> 00:01:52,875
It was to overcome that
weakness that Sasori

23
00:01:52,908 --> 00:01:56,246
created this puppet.

24
00:01:56,279 --> 00:02:02,220
It serves as his armor,
and his weapon, as well.

25
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:06,458
It's Sasori's specialty, Hiruko.

26
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:08,628
-You seem to know a lot
about it, Lady Chiyo.

27
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:15,236
-I know everything
about that puppet.

28
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:19,709
-But do you know how I prepare a
new specimen for my collection?

29
00:02:24,214 --> 00:02:26,984
First, I drain its blood.

30
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:31,490
Then I remove all the organs
and wash it inside and out.

31
00:02:31,524 --> 00:02:35,027
Make it nice and clean.

32
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:41,169
And then, after I've preserved
the body against decay,

33
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:45,607
the final step is to fill
it with hidden weapons.

34
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:50,613
As the hag said, this
one is called Hiruko.

35
00:02:50,647 --> 00:02:54,351
It's only one of the
specimens in my collection.

36
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:58,557
Once I've added
you and the girl,

37
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,297
I'll have collected exactly 300.

38
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,435
This is my art.

39
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:10,438
[theme music]

40
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,547
-Gaara.

41
00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:17,231
-Are you really sure you want
to waste your time on me?

42
00:05:17,265 --> 00:05:18,366
Hm?

43
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,168
Kakashi-sensei
with the Sharingan?

44
00:05:23,972 --> 00:05:28,545
You know, my man Sasori is
probably a more dangerous

45
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:34,219
opponent than I am, as
much as I hate to say that.

46
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:37,823
His idea of art is very
different from mine.

47
00:05:43,263 --> 00:05:46,100
-You call it art, do you?

48
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:47,670
-What do you mean?

49
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:51,407
-Long, long ago, when he
lived in the Hidden Sand,

50
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,210
he was esteemed as
a master craftsman,

51
00:05:54,244 --> 00:05:58,482
admired for his many
extraordinary puppets.

52
00:05:58,516 --> 00:06:01,086
But his true passion was
for making puppets out

53
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:04,924
of the living, then adding them
as specimens to his collection.

54
00:06:07,962 --> 00:06:12,000
He calls this
monstrous conduct art.

55
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:16,639
That puppet there,
Hiruko, he was a shinobi

56
00:06:16,672 --> 00:06:19,543
who lived in a nearby village.

57
00:06:19,576 --> 00:06:23,381
Sasori turned him
into what you see now.

58
00:06:23,414 --> 00:06:27,886
A puppet that retains the shell
of its previous physical form.

59
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,424
It's called a human puppet.

60
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,293
-A human puppet?

61
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,530
-And the same fate awaits you.

62
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:39,634
Will soon become another
of my works of art.

63
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:46,309
-This puppet's highly skilled
in attack and defense.

64
00:06:46,342 --> 00:06:48,178
Deadly at both.

65
00:06:48,212 --> 00:06:50,080
The first thing to
do is find a way

66
00:06:50,114 --> 00:06:52,183
to force Sasori out of there.

67
00:06:52,217 --> 00:06:54,185
-And how are we
supposed to do that?

68
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:58,190
-The trouble is that public
is full of hidden mechanisms.

69
00:06:58,224 --> 00:07:00,460
Without knowing
what they are, it's

70
00:07:00,494 --> 00:07:05,133
difficult to anticipate
exactly how to counteract them.

71
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,102
-On the other hand,
Lady Chiyo, you

72
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:10,273
know a lot about how
that puppet functions.

73
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:11,608
Meaning we have the advantage.

74
00:07:14,245 --> 00:07:15,613
-So I thought.

75
00:07:15,646 --> 00:07:18,850
That's why I was so sure I'd be
able to deal with him at first.

76
00:07:18,884 --> 00:07:20,685
-What are you saying?

77
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:24,190
-But now I realize
that I was wrong.

78
00:07:24,223 --> 00:07:24,891
-What?

79
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:26,693
What do you mean, wrong?

80
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:29,063
-Now that I've had
a better look at it,

81
00:07:29,096 --> 00:07:33,601
this one is different in ways
from the Hiruko puppet I knew.

82
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:40,544
The Hiruko I used to know didn't
have that shell on its back.

83
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:43,581
He must've heightened
its defenses.

84
00:07:43,614 --> 00:07:48,720
And that left arm is new to me.

85
00:07:48,754 --> 00:07:50,924
Not to mention the
hidden mechanisms.

86
00:07:50,957 --> 00:07:55,296
We have to assume they've been
refined and improved as well.

87
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:57,098
-So what do we do?

88
00:07:57,131 --> 00:07:59,668
-If we are to
defeat Sasuri, We'll

89
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:03,072
have to first destroy Hiruko.

90
00:08:03,106 --> 00:08:05,609
But that will require
enormous destructive power

91
00:08:05,642 --> 00:08:07,744
that I simply don't have.

92
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,812
Not nearly.

93
00:08:08,846 --> 00:08:11,216
But Sakura.

94
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:13,619
You do have it.

95
00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:20,427
With all the training
she's giving you,

96
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,631
you wield the monstrous strength
of Lady Tsunade herself.

97
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:30,507
-Right!

98
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:41,354
CHIYO: Listen to me, Sakura.

99
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,094
You must somehow
get close enough

100
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:50,632
to use your monster strength
to smash that puppet.

101
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,507
But to do that,
you will first have

102
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:02,747
to avoid every attack that his
hidden weapons launch at you.

103
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,616
You must dodge
every one perfectly.

104
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:11,926
You can't risk even
the slightest scratch.

105
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:14,361
-Because of the poison, right?

106
00:09:14,395 --> 00:09:15,830
-Exactly.

107
00:09:15,864 --> 00:09:18,600
As you know, the smallest
cut can be fatal.

108
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,039
-Here goes.

109
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:27,444
Hold him down!

110
00:09:27,477 --> 00:09:27,946
-Right.

111
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:39,192
-Before you can
ever get to him, he

112
00:09:39,226 --> 00:09:42,263
will strike at you with
all his hidden weapons.

113
00:09:42,296 --> 00:09:45,500
To survive, you must understand
and instantly anticipate

114
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:47,237
the puppet master's moves.

115
00:10:00,553 --> 00:10:04,591
-I'm not sure I'll be able
to do either of those.

116
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,395
-Yes, it's true.

117
00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:10,732
This kind of challenge requires
far more battle experience

118
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:13,235
than what you possess.

119
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:14,536
-All right, then.

120
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,806
What do we do?

121
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,609
-Take a good look at me.

122
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:20,144
What do you see?

123
00:10:20,177 --> 00:10:22,848
Simply a worthless
old bag of bones?

124
00:10:27,186 --> 00:10:27,954
Well, look again.

125
00:10:34,763 --> 00:10:39,568
Leave this part to me.

126
00:10:39,602 --> 00:10:43,307
Just count on me, Sakura.

127
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,911
Even his experience
doesn't compare to mine.

128
00:10:46,944 --> 00:10:49,047
Sasori knows this,
which explains

129
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,185
why he hesitates and doesn't
dare to attack us recklessly.

130
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:55,989
For someone who hates
to be kept waiting,

131
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,492
it must be very frustrating.

132
00:10:58,526 --> 00:11:03,365
What he doesn't know is I've
already made the first move.

133
00:11:06,536 --> 00:11:08,037
Sakura.

134
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:10,507
Come a little closer.

135
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,810
I'm going to tell you a secret.

136
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:19,885
Together, we shall finish him.

137
00:11:34,404 --> 00:11:35,872
-What are they up to?

138
00:11:45,685 --> 00:11:48,956
I can't make out a word
the old hag is saying.

139
00:11:53,428 --> 00:11:53,895
-Understood.

140
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:59,068
Ready when you are.

141
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:00,804
-Are you sure?

142
00:12:00,837 --> 00:12:02,806
Well, it's about time.

143
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:05,643
I really hate to
be kept waiting.

144
00:12:05,676 --> 00:12:08,079
Don't you?

145
00:12:08,112 --> 00:12:10,249
-No need to worry, Sasori.

146
00:12:14,587 --> 00:12:15,555
We'll end it quickly.

147
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:35,079
-Ah.

148
00:12:35,113 --> 00:12:35,847
It seems they've started.

149
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:46,127
How confident are you in that
young girl and the old lady?

150
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,565
You really think they're good
enough to handle my man Sasori?

151
00:12:49,598 --> 00:12:50,098
Huh?

152
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:58,809
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): He wants
to get me out of the way

153
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:02,047
so he can fight
Naruto one on one.

154
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,550
But this guy defeated
the Kazekage,

155
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:07,554
one of the five great Kage.

156
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:10,357
I don't Naruto on his
own could handle him.

157
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,759
-Go on, Sensei.

158
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:12,760
Go to Sakura.

159
00:13:12,794 --> 00:13:14,095
I'll handle this.

160
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:14,596
-Huh?

161
00:13:25,576 --> 00:13:26,777
-Go on, Sensei.

162
00:13:26,811 --> 00:13:28,013
Don't worry.

163
00:13:28,046 --> 00:13:29,515
I'll take care of it!

164
00:13:29,548 --> 00:13:31,016
I'll save Gaara!

165
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:13,703
-Good.

166
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:15,339
It would have been
very disappointing

167
00:14:15,372 --> 00:14:17,107
if you'd been
beaten that easily.

168
00:14:20,912 --> 00:14:23,249
-Let go of him!

169
00:14:23,282 --> 00:14:24,784
I'll never let you have him!

170
00:15:32,068 --> 00:15:35,406
SASORI (VOICEOVER): They
were ready for that one, eh?

171
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:36,908
In that case--

172
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:46,253
-Now die!

173
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:21,430
SASORI (VOICEOVER):
They dodged every one?

174
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:21,931
Impossible!

175
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,246
The old hag, I can understand.

176
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:36,182
But this-- this girl?

177
00:16:43,124 --> 00:16:44,092
But how?

178
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:55,105
And Granny Chiyo's just--
just standing there.

179
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,077
Is this girl mocking me?

180
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:02,915
Is she really attacking
me head on all by herself?

181
00:17:06,353 --> 00:17:06,820
Now.

182
00:17:10,758 --> 00:17:12,194
What?

183
00:17:12,227 --> 00:17:14,663
something stopped it?

184
00:17:14,696 --> 00:17:15,365
Of course.

185
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:17,400
Chiyo.

186
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:19,103
-Now, Sakura.

187
00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:20,504
Now!

188
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:22,808
Strike it down!

189
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:23,308
-Right!

190
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:35,657
-I'll get Gaara.

191
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,692
Nothing can stop me!

192
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:40,796
-You're quite an unusual
Jinchuriki, aren't you?

193
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:45,535
I thought you were
all sullen loners who

194
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:47,371
didn't care about anyone else.

195
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:56,115
To date, we've destroyed two
Jinchuriki, not including him,

196
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:57,951
of course.

197
00:17:57,984 --> 00:18:02,157
But nobody ever tried to
save them from us before.

198
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,359
Not a single friend or neighbor.

199
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:06,195
Not a soul came to their aid.

200
00:18:08,831 --> 00:18:11,068
In fact, it seemed
like most people

201
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:13,670
were happy to finally
be rid of them.

202
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,683
You cant forsake one of
your own kind, can you?

203
00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:27,388
You feel connected to
this pathetic creature.

204
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:28,356
Such a shame.

205
00:18:54,555 --> 00:18:58,027
Gaara died when the One
Tail was extracted from him.

206
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:05,436
Very soon now, the same
thing'll happen to you.

207
00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:19,019
-If Gaara's dead,
you're gonna pay!

208
00:19:52,996 --> 00:19:53,796
CHIYO: Heh.

209
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,965
So, you finally come out, eh?

210
00:20:02,507 --> 00:20:04,110
-Is that his real body?

211
00:20:04,143 --> 00:20:05,411
-Come, now.

212
00:20:05,444 --> 00:20:07,613
Let me get a good look at you.

213
00:20:07,646 --> 00:20:10,117
I've come all this
way to see you.

214
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:21,931
I've waited 20 years.

215
00:20:21,965 --> 00:20:26,003
I want to see my
grandson's face.

What's My Profession.

And here's today's
final challenge.

219
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,095
Can you guess what
this person does?

220
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:07,365
NARUTO: The guy's covered
in a cape from head to toe!

221
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:08,166
SAKURA: I know.

222
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:09,167
It's a famous actor, right?

[buzzing]

00:22:10,303 --> 00:22:11,537

muscular carpenter?

226
00:22:13,105 --> 00:22:14,775
SAKURA: Does the job
require a uniform?

227
00:22:14,808 --> 00:22:15,742
NARUTO: Give us a hint.

228
00:22:15,776 --> 00:22:16,443
MAN: No hints.

SAKURA: No!

232
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,682
NARUTO: Wait, hold on!

233
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:21,917
-Aw, too bad.

234
00:22:21,951 --> 00:22:24,853
Now let's have our guest
take off that cape.

235

238

NARUTO: A word from the
Society for Leaf Tourism!

239
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:43,644
This is the most
famous sweet dumpling

shop in the whole village.

241
00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:47,882
Even people with a serious
sweet tooth like Anko-sensei

242
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,986
swear by it, so
you know it's good.

243
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:54,291
-Well, maybe, but it doesn't
look all that good to me.

-Trust me on this one, granny.

This place is the best.

When Itachi and Kisame
slipped into the Leaf village,

247
00:22:59,998 --> 00:23:01,867
where do you think they
stopped for dumplings?

248
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,535
Right here.

249
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:04,169
-Oh?

00:23:04,203 --> 00:23:06,172
Even the Akatsuki.

251
00:23:06,206 --> 00:23:07,707
Well, I suppose
this is something

252
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:10,344
I should try before I die then.

NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Die?

254

What's she talking about?
