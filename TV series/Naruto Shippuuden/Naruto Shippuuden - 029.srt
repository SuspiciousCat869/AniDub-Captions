1
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:30,764
-Huh?

2
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:52,185
A worthy adversary.

3
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,655
I'd expect no less
from a clone of me.

4
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:32,926
-I did it.

5
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,089
-Yes.

6
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,669
-Are you all there?

7
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:16,970
Did you beat them?

8
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:18,305
LEE (ON RADIO): Yes, Guy-sensei.

9
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:19,272
NEJI (ON RADIO): Yeah.

10
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,407
TENTEN (ON RADIO): Of course.

11
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,675
-Good.

12
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:25,946
Then let's go give Team
Kakashi the backup they need.

13
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,247
-On our way.

14
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:00,947
-Lady Chiyo!

15
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,021
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Lady Chiyo.

16
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,894
It's no surprise.

17
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,996
With Sasori's poison
working on her,

18
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,331
it's amazing she hasn't
already passed out.

19
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,403
-We have to get
back and neutralize

20
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,305
that poison, and quickly.

21
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,641
Our job here is finished.

22
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:31,111
We beat him.

23
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:35,782
-But more than that,
there's something I must do.

24
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,421
My job isn't done.

25
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,423
Yet.

26
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,792
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): It's only
the sheer force of her will

27
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:46,793
that keeps her conscious.

28
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,201
What is this thing she
has to do that she'd

29
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,535
push herself so hard?

30
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,812
-I'm sorry.

31
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:06,446
-Here we go.

32
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,526
-Still on my tail, I see.

33
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:40,380
-Time to give it a try.

34
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:40,881
Naruto.

35
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,315
-Hm?

36
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,785
-You'd better fall
back a little.

37
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,219
-Right, Sensei.

38
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,187
Got it.

39
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,132
Mangekyo sharingan.

40
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,673
[theme music]

41
00:06:58,576 --> 00:07:00,044
-Mangekyo Sharingan.

42
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:38,115
-Whoa.

43
00:07:42,186 --> 00:07:44,188
-What is this?

44
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:45,122
What's going on?

45
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:56,734
A visual jutsu.

46
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,037
No!

47
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:13,450
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): What
kinda jutsu is this?

48
00:08:13,484 --> 00:08:13,951
Incredible.

49
00:08:25,362 --> 00:08:27,064
-I've got you now.

50
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:11,475
Damn.

51
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:34,431
-My arm is being sucked into
oblivion by this damn jutsu.

52
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:57,554
-I missed.

53
00:10:04,862 --> 00:10:07,431
I'm still not very good
at controlling the size

54
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:09,500
or position of
the barrier space.

55
00:10:12,202 --> 00:10:14,538
But I'll get it right this time.

56
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:06,617
-Damn it.

57
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,552
I let him get away.

58
00:12:08,585 --> 00:12:09,787
-Well, good.

59
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,988
I shook him off.

60
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:24,268
-Rasengan!

61
00:12:35,612 --> 00:12:36,280
-Good job.

62
00:12:41,251 --> 00:12:43,453
-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

63
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,237
Gaara.

64
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,980
Gaara.

65
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:11,281
Gaara!

66
00:13:11,315 --> 00:13:12,216
Kakashi-sensei.

67
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,350
You all right?

68
00:13:13,383 --> 00:13:14,351
-Yeah.

69
00:13:14,384 --> 00:13:15,018
I think so.

70
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:23,026
-Don't worry, Gaara.

71
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,394
We'll get you out.

72
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:30,167
Hey, Gaara!

73
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,719
-They came this way
from the looks of it.

74
00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:50,120
-You're right.

75
00:13:50,153 --> 00:13:52,155
They were probably following the
one who had taken Gaara away.

76
00:13:57,227 --> 00:13:57,794
-You monsters.

77
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:04,234
Gaara!

78
00:14:04,268 --> 00:14:06,904
What are you doing, Gaara?

79
00:14:06,937 --> 00:14:07,604
Come on.

80
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,773
Knock it off already!

81
00:14:09,806 --> 00:14:11,108
-Enough, Naruto.

82
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:14,411
You know full well that--

83
00:14:14,444 --> 00:14:18,148
-Your friend right,
and you know it, too.

84
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:20,150
He's been dead for a while now.

85
00:14:27,457 --> 00:14:29,860
CHIYO: We must hurry.

86
00:14:29,893 --> 00:14:30,594
-Right.

87
00:14:30,627 --> 00:14:31,728
But please.

88
00:14:31,762 --> 00:14:33,664
You have to tell me if
the pain gets too great.

89
00:14:33,697 --> 00:14:34,631
-I will.

90
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:54,636
-Lee.

91
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:58,206
-Pick up the pace there, Tenten,
or I will leave you behind.

92
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,374
-What are you talking about?

93
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:01,276
I was only dragging my
heels waiting for you

94
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:02,510
guys to catch up.

95
00:15:02,544 --> 00:15:03,845
-Oh, sorry.

96
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:06,247
But Naruto and the rest expect
us to keep our rendezvous

97
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,349
with them, so we
really must move.

98
00:15:08,383 --> 00:15:09,517
Let us go.

99
00:15:09,551 --> 00:15:10,618
-Hold on.

100
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:12,987
Shouldn't we wait for
Guy-sensei and Neji?

101
00:15:13,021 --> 00:15:14,889
-Oh, I would not
worry about them.

102
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,127
-Why so slow, you two?

103
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,128
Hurry it up.

104
00:15:20,161 --> 00:15:21,129
-Argh.

105
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:22,096
Now look what you
have done Tenten.

106
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,599
You let them get ahead of us.

107
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,833
-Huh?

108
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:28,603
Well, we'll just see
who gets ahead of who.

109
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,338
cashier are you there?

110
00:15:30,371 --> 00:15:31,806
Come in, Kakashi.

111
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,841
Guess the radio is out of range.

112
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,979
Neji, can you see what's going
on with Kakashi and the others?

113
00:15:38,012 --> 00:15:39,414
-Yes, I see them.

114
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:42,784
They're still engaged
with the enemy.

115
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,887
It appears they've
recovered the Kazekage.

116
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,089
However

117
00:15:48,122 --> 00:15:48,623
-However?

118
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:02,870
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Gaara.

119
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:17,218
-Talk to me.

120
00:16:24,492 --> 00:16:25,293
Hey.

121
00:16:25,326 --> 00:16:26,928
Come on.

122
00:16:26,961 --> 00:16:27,428
Gaara.

123
00:16:38,973 --> 00:16:39,440
Gaara!

124
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,051
DEIDARA: I told you, didn't I?

125
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:52,687
Gaara's dead.

126
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,522
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER):
It worked perfectly.

127
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,993
Using the Kazekage as bait to
lure out the Leaf Jinchuriki.

128
00:16:59,027 --> 00:17:07,302
But what I didn't plan on was
that one coming along too.

129
00:17:10,672 --> 00:17:13,841
First it was my left arm.

130
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:14,842
-Sand coffin.

131
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:22,150
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER): Crushed
by the sand Jinchuriki.

132
00:17:22,183 --> 00:17:25,286
Now my right arm too.

133
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,654
I can't use any jutsu.

134
00:17:26,688 --> 00:17:27,255
It's over.

135
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:41,803
I never thought it meet anyone
with visual jutsu as powerful

136
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:44,472
as Itachi's.

137
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:46,941
This Jinchuriki is nothing.

138
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:50,111
The problem is how
to deal with Kakashi.

139
00:17:50,144 --> 00:17:50,611
Hm.

140
00:17:56,551 --> 00:18:00,355
-You will pay for this.

141
00:18:00,388 --> 00:18:02,557
-Yeah, yeah.

142
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,860
Maybe someday I'll give
you a rematch, kid.

143
00:18:05,893 --> 00:18:06,694
Ha.

144
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:08,863
-You've let down your guard.

145
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,301
-Damn it.

146
00:18:19,907 --> 00:18:20,908
-Yes!

147
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:22,577
-Dropped your guard, didn't you?

148
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,778
You should be more careful.

149
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,817
-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:19:00,081 --> 00:19:00,548
-Naruto.

151
00:19:17,932 --> 00:19:19,200
It's clay.

152
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:19,834
A substitution.

153
00:20:13,955 --> 00:20:14,922
Is that--

[theme music]

155
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:02,363
JIRAIYA: Get your hankies ready,
because our next episode's

156
00:22:02,396 --> 00:22:03,864
inspiring conclusion
is guaranteed

157
00:22:03,898 --> 00:22:04,999
to move you to tears.

158
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,901
Watch as I rush in
from afar to save

159

my knuckleheaded
but lovable student

with the power of devotion.

KAKASHI: Hey, I'm
involved in this too.

162
00:22:12,607 --> 00:22:15,009
It's the devotion of two
masters that saves him.

163
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:15,977
JIRAIYA: Fine.

164
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,411
We'll call the
episode Devotion Saved

165
00:22:17,445 --> 00:22:19,146
the Knuckle-Headed Student!

166
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,881
KAKASHI: Sounds
good, Master Jiraiya.

167
00:22:20,915 --> 00:22:22,016
What do you say, Naruto?

168
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:22,984
You on board with that?

169
00:22:23,017 --> 00:22:24,452
NARUTO: No way.

170
00:22:24,485 --> 00:22:26,454
That title sucks!

-The Leaf Ask Us Anything
Investigation Team.

173
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:44,905
-Any question you have,
we're here to answer it.

174
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:48,109
-And today's question
is, what's Kakashi-sensei

175
00:22:48,142 --> 00:22:50,177
got under his mask, anyway?

176
00:22:50,211 --> 00:22:52,279
-This is a very
popular question.

177
00:22:52,313 --> 00:22:54,949
-Yeah, we tried everything we
could think of go to find out.

178
00:22:54,982 --> 00:22:57,385
We bought him some ramen once
so we could watch him eat it,

179
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,286
but no luck.

180
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,922
SAKURA: We tried following
him, but that didn't work.

181
00:23:01,956 --> 00:23:05,059
NARUTO: The guy keeps his mask
on even when he takes a bath.

182
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,494
SAKURA: Pretty
weird for a sensei.

183
00:23:06,527 --> 00:23:07,595
For anybody.

184
00:23:07,628 --> 00:23:09,030
NARUTO: Then we tried
disguising ourselves

185
00:23:09,063 --> 00:23:10,464
and using brute force.

186
00:23:10,498 --> 00:23:11,399
SAKURA: Yeah.

187
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,634
That worked out really well.

188
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:15,703
NARUTO: Oh, yeah.

189
00:23:15,736 --> 00:23:17,905
SAKURA: Finally, he answered
the question himself

190
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,207
when he took off his
mask and showed us.

191
00:23:20,241 --> 00:23:23,811
NARUTO: And do you know
what was underneath?

192
00:23:23,844 --> 00:23:26,313
Nothing but another stupid mask.

193
00:23:26,347 --> 00:23:27,448
That's all.

194
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:29,950
-Yeah, he totally faked us out.

195
00:23:29,984 --> 00:23:32,987
-Still, we'll never give
up trying to find out.

196
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,322
-We'll get a look at his
face one of these days.

197
00:23:35,356 --> 00:23:36,957
-So you be sure and stay tuned.

198
00:23:36,991 --> 00:23:38,793
Got it?
