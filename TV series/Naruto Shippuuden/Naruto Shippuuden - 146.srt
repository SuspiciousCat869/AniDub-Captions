1
00:00:09,107 --> 00:00:10,075
-Naruto?

2
00:00:10,108 --> 00:00:10,575
-Uh.

3
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:13,445
-I--

4
00:00:18,082 --> 00:00:18,881
-You'll be fine.

5
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:23,353
-Thank you.

6
00:00:30,892 --> 00:00:32,927
{\an1}-What's the matter, Naruto?

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,429
{\an1}-Sorry, Captain Yamato.

8
00:00:34,463 --> 00:00:36,864
{\an1}But I think you better
go on ahead without me

9
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:38,966
{\an1}because I've got to go
back to that village.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,434
-Go back?

11
00:00:40,468 --> 00:00:43,236
-Something about
that place bugs me.

12
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,138
{\an1}I can't stop thinking
about the way

13
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:46,573
{\an1}those villagers looked at her.

14
00:00:58,449 --> 00:00:59,450
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Damn!

15
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:01,686
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

16
00:01:15,564 --> 00:01:18,667
{\an1}-You must be tired from
your long journey, Hotaru.

17
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,934
Please come.

18
00:01:20,968 --> 00:01:21,636
-Uh, sure.

19
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:29,275
-Follow me.

20
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:34,547
{\an1}VILLAGER 1: Oh, what
is the chief thinking?

21
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,449
{\an1}VILLAGER 2: Does he really
intend to shelter her here?

22
00:01:37,482 --> 00:01:38,717
{\an1}VILLAGER 1: You must be kidding.

23
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,118
{\an1}If something happens, we'll
all be in big trouble.

24
00:01:41,152 --> 00:01:41,787
-Shh.

25
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:42,721
{\an1}Don't say anymore.

26
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:52,262
-Uncle, should I
not have come back?

27
00:01:52,295 --> 00:01:54,397
{\an1}-No, don't be silly.

28
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:57,166
{\an1}You're finally home,
just as you should be.

29
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,967
{\an1}Now, get some rest.

30
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:00,469
-Thank you.

31
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:02,370
-Hm, of course.

32
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:08,108
-[sighs]

33
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:12,279
{\an1}MAN: So we finally meet,
granddaughter of En no Gyoja.

34
00:02:12,312 --> 00:02:13,246
-Who are you?

35
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:26,691
{\an1}-I knew you'd count
on this village

36
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:28,493
to protect you
and keep you safe.

37
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:34,598
{\an1}-You must be the ones
who attacked the fort!

38
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:38,134
Help!

39
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:39,602
Let me out!

40
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:42,070
{\an1}Uncle, please open the door!

41
00:02:42,104 --> 00:02:43,071
Uncle!

42
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:44,573
{\an1}Uncle, someone, please!

43
00:02:44,606 --> 00:02:46,074
Help!

44
00:02:46,108 --> 00:02:46,641
-Give up.

45
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:48,309
It's useless.

46
00:02:48,343 --> 00:02:49,877
{\an1}Hand over the Forbidden Jutsu.

47
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,846
-No, never!

48
00:03:03,656 --> 00:03:04,423
Ugh!

49
00:03:04,456 --> 00:03:05,691
{\an1}-Don't give us any trouble.

50
00:03:05,724 --> 00:03:07,024
-Take it easy.

51
00:03:07,058 --> 00:03:09,193
{\an1}You really shouldn't handle
a lady like that, you know.

52
00:03:09,227 --> 00:03:10,528
-[snickers]

53
00:03:10,561 --> 00:03:14,565
Like you've ever
been nice to a lady.

54
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,433
-Here it is.

55
00:03:19,202 --> 00:03:22,539
{\an1}-At last, the jutsu is ours.

56
00:03:22,572 --> 00:03:24,006
-[grunts]

57
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:24,507
Aah!

58
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,816
-[coughs]

59
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,083
[chuckles]

60
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,651
{\an1}Should have guessed
it was rigged.

61
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,620
{\an1}-Ugh, where is that brat?

62
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,522
-Quick, we can't
let her get away!

63
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,193
{\an1}HOTARU (VOICEOVER):
I can't believe

64
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,862
{\an1}those thieves had already
infiltrated the village.

65
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,330
{\an1}I have to get away
from here, and fast!

66
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,104
{\an1}-Trying to hide in the forest.

67
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:01,605
Humph.

68
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:10,045
-[panting]

69
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,388
[gasps]

70
00:04:20,421 --> 00:04:21,889
-[chuckles]

71
00:04:21,923 --> 00:04:24,191
It looks like we
found you, young lady.

72
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:25,692
-[gasps]

73
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:28,160
{\an1}Water Style Raging Rain!

74
00:04:28,194 --> 00:04:28,662
-Agh!

75
00:04:28,695 --> 00:04:29,161
Aah!

76
00:04:32,665 --> 00:04:34,098
-Ugh!

77
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:35,468
-Huh!

78
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:38,269
{\an1}I can't believe that a jutsu
like that stopped you, Chushin.

79
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:39,471
-Shut up!

80
00:04:39,504 --> 00:04:41,739
She caught me by
surprise, that's all.

81
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:42,607
-Heh.

82
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,675
-Enough!

83
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,342
Playtime's over.

84
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,109
Tell me before I
lose my patience.

85
00:04:47,144 --> 00:04:49,078
{\an1}Where is the Forbidden Jutsu?

86
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:49,580
-Uhh.

87
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:53,783
{\an1}-Nyah, what a pain!

88
00:04:53,816 --> 00:04:55,217
-[chuckles]

89
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,887
{\an1}I'd start talking if I were you.

90
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,655
{\an1}Benten may look like a
girl, but when he gets mad,

91
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:02,491
{\an1}he's really quite scary.

92
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:03,892
-I won't talk.

93
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:05,826
That jutsu is my
people's last hope.

94
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,794
{\an1}You can't have it!

95
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:09,663
{\an1}-Ah, this is getting ridiculous.

96
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:10,831
[slurp]

97
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:12,732
{\an1}If you don't feel
like talking, then I

98
00:05:12,765 --> 00:05:15,401
{\an1}guess I'll just have to convince
you to change your mind.

99
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:17,770
-[gasps]

100
00:05:17,804 --> 00:05:18,604
{\an1}-Don't kill her yet.

101
00:05:18,637 --> 00:05:19,905
-[chuckles]

102
00:05:19,938 --> 00:05:22,173
{\an1}That just depends on whether
she's willing to cooperate.

103
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:28,513
-[sobs]

104
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:32,516
-What?

105
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:40,489
{\an1}-What is all this racket?

106
00:05:40,523 --> 00:05:44,259
{\an1}Can't a guy even get
a nap around here?

107
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:45,760
-Utakata!

108
00:05:45,793 --> 00:05:47,060
-He's back?

109
00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:48,663
I can't believe
you're still alive.

110
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:50,597
{\an1}I thought we killed you.

111
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:57,738
{\an1}-Huh, well, I really am
sorry to disappoint you.

112
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:00,640
[yawns]

113
00:06:00,673 --> 00:06:02,608
{\an1}Look, it's not like
I'm particularly

114
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:04,576
{\an1}eager to fight the four of you.

115
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:06,511
{\an1}But she and I have a
little unfinished business

116
00:06:06,545 --> 00:06:07,579
to take care of.

117
00:07:54,937 --> 00:07:57,238
{\an1}NARUTO: What, Hotaru's gone?

118
00:07:57,271 --> 00:07:59,440
{\an1}Wha-- what happened?

119
00:07:59,474 --> 00:08:02,309
{\an1}-I'm not entirely sure
myself, I'm afraid.

120
00:08:02,343 --> 00:08:05,512
{\an1}This house is where I hid
Hotaru to try to keep her safe.

121
00:08:05,545 --> 00:08:06,780
{\an1}Then I heard a loud noise.

122
00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:11,183
{\an1}And when I rushed over to see
what happened, she was gone.

123
00:08:11,217 --> 00:08:11,818
-All right.

124
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:13,352
{\an1}I'll help search.

125
00:08:13,386 --> 00:08:16,221
{\an1}First, tell me where
you've already looked.

126
00:08:16,254 --> 00:08:18,958
{\an1}-Oh, uh, well, you see we
haven't actually started

127
00:08:18,991 --> 00:08:20,492
{\an1}looking for her yet, so--

128
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:23,193
-What?

129
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:25,864
{\an1}Why wouldn't you look
for her right away?

130
00:08:25,897 --> 00:08:28,399
{\an1}Judging by the damage,
something bad happened.

131
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:29,700
{\an1}She could be injured!

132
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:30,968
-Yes, I know.

133
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:31,668
It's just--

134
00:08:34,537 --> 00:08:36,539
{\an1}-What is wrong with you people?

135
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:37,606
{\an1}She's one of your own!

136
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,708
{\an1}You should be doing
everything you can!

137
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:40,575
{\an1}MAN: Enough, Naruto.

138
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,513
{\an1}Arguing about it won't help.

139
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:48,482
-Captain Yamato,
why are you here?

140
00:08:48,516 --> 00:08:50,117
{\an1}-We were worried about her, too.

141
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:52,752
{\an1}So we rushed back
as fast as we could.

142
00:08:52,786 --> 00:08:54,821
{\an1}Seems we were right.

143
00:08:54,854 --> 00:08:57,356
{\an1}So when did you last see Hotaru?

144
00:08:57,389 --> 00:08:58,958
{\an1}-Just a while ago.

145
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:00,359
After you three
brought her here,

146
00:09:00,392 --> 00:09:01,794
I showed her
directly to her room.

147
00:09:01,827 --> 00:09:03,428
{\an1}Right there in that house.

148
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:04,830
{\an1}-Then not much time has passed.

149
00:09:04,863 --> 00:09:06,864
{\an1}She couldn't have
gotten too far.

150
00:09:06,898 --> 00:09:07,932
{\an1}Let's hurry, Naruto.

151
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:08,700
-Yeah, but--

152
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:16,773
{\an1}-Her safety is our
primary concern.

153
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:17,273
Go.

154
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,280
{\an1}-I knew you'd come.

155
00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:27,716
I just knew that
you'd come to save me.

156
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:30,118
{\an1}-Well, that isn't
quite the situation.

157
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:32,419
{\an1}But now that I'm here, I
guess I better do something.

158
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:37,557
{\an1}-What's with this guy?

159
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,625
{\an1}I was completely certain
that we'd taken him out

160
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:41,060
{\an1}with our jutsu back then.

161
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:42,328
{\an1}-Boy, are you scheming!

162
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:45,630
{\an1}You think you could steal
our treasure away from us?

163
00:09:45,664 --> 00:09:48,266
{\an1}-Not on my watch.

164
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,266
-Acid Flower.

165
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:52,670
-Uh!

166
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,841
{\an1}-Nango, get back!

167
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:00,577
-Oh, well.

168
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,513
{\an1}It looks like I missed him.

169
00:10:03,546 --> 00:10:04,013
-Hah!

170
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:17,324
-Surround him.

171
00:10:17,357 --> 00:10:18,793
{\an1}He won't get away this time.

172
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:32,972
{\an1}-He's out of range.

173
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:33,905
-Bye-bye now.

174
00:10:33,938 --> 00:10:35,073
-No, you don't!

175
00:10:35,106 --> 00:10:36,541
-Look out!

176
00:10:36,574 --> 00:10:37,041
-Uh!

177
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,315
-Quick enough to
dodge that kunai.

178
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:47,583
-Duh!

179
00:10:47,617 --> 00:10:50,452
{\an1}-Even if he is fast, he
couldn't have gotten very far.

180
00:10:50,485 --> 00:10:51,620
{\an1}So let's go get him.

181
00:10:51,653 --> 00:10:52,320
MAN: Forget it.

182
00:10:56,858 --> 00:10:58,026
{\an1}-We can catch him.

183
00:10:58,059 --> 00:10:59,627
{\an1}-Yeah, you're not just
going to let him get away

184
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,028
{\an1}with our treasure, are you?

185
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,735
{\an1}-This is a Bingo Book
from the Hidden Mist.

186
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,435
{\an1}-And it tells us that
we've just stumbled

187
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:14,706
{\an1}upon a very interesting man.

188
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,340
-Ah, I see.

189
00:11:16,374 --> 00:11:19,644
{\an1}The price on his head is so big,
he made it into this book, huh?

190
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:20,478
-No way!

191
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:21,813
{\an1}That guy is worth 50 million?

192
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:23,446
{\an1}-Well, I guess we're in luck.

193
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:25,049
{\an1}That girl's jutsu
is worth a fortune.

194
00:11:25,082 --> 00:11:26,150
And now this?

195
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:28,084
{\an1}We'll all be rolling
in money soon.

196
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:31,353
{\an1}-But a bounty this high
means a serious downside.

197
00:11:31,387 --> 00:11:34,090
{\an1}He must be a pretty
formidable guy.

198
00:11:34,124 --> 00:11:36,725
{\an1}-Heh, don't get cold
feet now, Chushin.

199
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:39,128
{\an1}This is finally our
chance to hit it big.

200
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:40,229
-Cold feet, huh?

201
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:41,329
{\an1}Listen, you little--

202
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:42,163
-Quiet!

203
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:44,098
{\an1}I've heard enough out of you.

204
00:11:44,132 --> 00:11:46,400
{\an1}All right, so what's
the plan then?

205
00:11:52,272 --> 00:11:52,805
-Hm.

206
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:53,673
Now, listen up.

207
00:12:04,816 --> 00:12:06,350
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
This is my fault.

208
00:12:09,787 --> 00:12:13,790
I should have
returned immediately.

209
00:12:13,823 --> 00:12:16,626
{\an1}-Captain, let me ask you.

210
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:19,229
{\an1}Our assignment, it was
to protect that woman

211
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:20,796
until we reached
the village, right?

212
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:23,665
-Yes, that was
supposed to be it.

213
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:25,600
But if we can't
completely guarantee

214
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:27,802
{\an1}that she's safe in the
village, then the mission

215
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:29,570
has no meaning.

216
00:12:29,604 --> 00:12:30,504
-Hm.

217
00:12:30,538 --> 00:12:32,606
{\an1}-This assignment--
our mission is

218
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,309
{\an1}based on a treaty that was
drawn up by the Third Hokage

219
00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:37,711
{\an1}and En no Gyoja of
the Tsuchigumo clan.

220
00:12:37,744 --> 00:12:40,347
{\an1}That means that if
the clan is currently

221
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:44,116
{\an1}unable to protect her, then it's
our responsibility to do so.

222
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,757
{\an1}Go, Sai, find her.

223
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,726
{\an1}Scan the whole area if you must.

224
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:56,827
{\an1}-Understood, sir.

225
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:05,234
{\an1}Ninja Art, Super Beast Scroll!

226
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,439
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Hold on, Hotaru.

227
00:13:12,473 --> 00:13:13,807
{\an1}We'll find you, I promise.

228
00:13:35,026 --> 00:13:37,662
{\an1}-Utakata, where are we?

229
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:50,973
Oh!

230
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:53,574
[giggles]

231
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:54,542
{\an1}We're up so high!

232
00:14:16,861 --> 00:14:20,131
{\an1}-This looks safe.

233
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:22,032
{\an1}-I thought I was done for.

234
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:24,935
{\an1}You truly are an amazing man.

235
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:26,203
{\an1}-Don't get the wrong idea.

236
00:14:26,236 --> 00:14:29,406
{\an1}It wasn't really my intention
to come and save you.

237
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,308
{\an1}-Then why did you show
up and fight those guys?

238
00:14:32,342 --> 00:14:34,609
-Well, I-- it's
because I've become

239
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:36,878
{\an1}very curious about this
Forbidden Jutsu of yours

240
00:14:36,912 --> 00:14:40,148
{\an1}that they want so badly.

241
00:14:40,182 --> 00:14:41,216
-You're lying.

242
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:42,417
I know you are.

243
00:14:42,451 --> 00:14:44,352
{\an1}You aren't like that at all.

244
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:46,320
{\an1}-Well, you never can tell.

245
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:48,021
{\an1}There isn't a single
person in this world

246
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,357
{\an1}that doesn't love money.

247
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,190
-Oh, stop.

248
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,025
{\an1}Don't pretend to be a villain.

249
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:55,995
-Uh, eh.

250
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,997
[sighs]

251
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,732
{\an1}You really have this knack
for knocking me off-balance,

252
00:15:00,765 --> 00:15:02,401
you know that?

253
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:06,570
{\an1}So what will you do now?

254
00:15:06,603 --> 00:15:09,374
{\an1}Those guys aren't the only
ones who want that jutsu.

255
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:12,608
{\an1}I'm sure others are bound
to turn up sooner or later.

256
00:15:12,641 --> 00:15:14,011
{\an1}-I know you're right.

257
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:17,179
{\an1}That's exactly the reason
I have to become stronger,

258
00:15:17,213 --> 00:15:18,714
{\an1}why I must become your student.

259
00:15:18,748 --> 00:15:20,116
-Not again.

260
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:21,783
{\an1}I cannot keep having
this discussion.

261
00:15:21,816 --> 00:15:24,386
{\an1}Besides, this memento
of your grandfather's

262
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:28,256
{\an1}or whatever it is, why do you
feel so driven to protect it?

263
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:31,191
-Well, first and
foremost, it's to honor

264
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:36,863
the wishes of my
master-- my grandfather.

265
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:39,765
{\an1}You see, he was the
first person to teach me.

266
00:15:39,798 --> 00:15:43,301
{\an1}A master and student
must be one in thought.

267
00:15:43,335 --> 00:15:47,105
{\an1}And I want to fulfill
my grandfather's dream--

268
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:49,974
{\an1}to restore the Tsuchigumo clan.

269
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:52,476
{\an1}That jutsu must never
leave my possession.

270
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,388
-Hah!

271
00:16:06,422 --> 00:16:08,890
{\an1}Be one in thought.

272
00:16:08,923 --> 00:16:09,924
{\an1}You're deluding yourself.

273
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,295
{\an1}-Where are you going?

274
00:16:14,328 --> 00:16:16,763
-I'm under no
obligation to stay.

275
00:16:16,797 --> 00:16:18,799
{\an1}So if you want to play
"master and student,"

276
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:20,367
{\an1}go find someone else.

277
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,101
{\an1}-I'm not playing.

278
00:16:22,134 --> 00:16:23,969
{\an1}I'm totally serious about this.

279
00:16:24,003 --> 00:16:25,538
{\an1}It's important to me.

280
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,306
{\an1}I need you to be my master.

281
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:29,140
{\an1}-You can't stop me
from leaving, you know.

282
00:16:29,174 --> 00:16:30,476
-I know I can't.

283
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:34,611
{\an1}But still, my feelings
aren't going to change.

284
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:36,046
That's why--

285
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,514
-Uh.

286
00:16:43,152 --> 00:16:43,619
Hey!

287
00:16:43,653 --> 00:16:44,320
Stop that!

288
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:45,755
{\an1}Why are you doing this?

289
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:46,855
Uhh.

290
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:48,524
{\an1}-I don't want any
secrets between us.

291
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:49,791
{\an1}I want you to know--

292
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:52,060
-Uh, eh, uh, I--

293
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,196
{\an1}---to see absolutely
everything about me.

294
00:17:24,488 --> 00:17:31,560
{\an1}-Hotaru, you didn't-- how
could they do that to you?

295
00:17:31,595 --> 00:17:34,163
{\an1}-No one else knows
anything about this.

296
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:35,897
{\an1}But I didn't want
to hide it from you,

297
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,999
{\an1}not after all that
we've been through.

298
00:17:38,032 --> 00:17:41,069
{\an1}Please, Ushakata, be my--

299
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,437
-No!

300
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,904
Don't say it.

301
00:17:48,808 --> 00:17:49,409
Just don't.

302
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:54,846
{\an1}-Hidden Jutsu, Kirisame.

303
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:03,254
-[gasps]

304
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:03,754
Damn it.

305
00:18:08,626 --> 00:18:09,993
I knew it.

306
00:18:10,026 --> 00:18:11,961
{\an1}This rain is Kirisame.

307
00:18:11,995 --> 00:18:16,299
{\an1}MAN: Utakata, there is
no escape for you now.

308
00:18:16,332 --> 00:18:17,866
{\an1}-What's going on?

309
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,569
{\an1}MAN: We cannot keep the
village waiting any longer.

310
00:18:20,602 --> 00:18:22,937
{\an1}-You certainly are persistent,
I'll give you that.

311
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:23,905
{\an1}Stay back, Hotaru.

312
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,277
{\an1}MAN: Water Style, Water Whip!

313
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,777
-Aah!

314
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,511
-Hotaru!

315
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,947
-Aah!

316
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,848
{\an1}MAN: I'll only say it once.

00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,184
{\an1}Stop resisting and come with us!

318
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:42,053
{\an1}Try anything and this girl dies.

320
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,990
Utakata.

321
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,824
{\an1}-Do whatever you want to her.

322
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:50,395
That girl means
absolutely nothing to me.

323
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:53,063
{\an1}I couldn't care less
what happens to her.

324
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:54,364
-I see.

325
00:18:54,398 --> 00:18:56,933
{\an1}Well, I guess we'll find out.

-[grunts]

327
00:19:05,473 --> 00:19:07,542
{\an1}-I thought that would work.

328
00:19:07,576 --> 00:19:09,910
{\an1}Now, will you return
to the village with us?

329
00:19:09,944 --> 00:19:12,780
{\an1}-No matter how many times
you ask, the answer is no.

330
00:19:12,813 --> 00:19:16,317
{\an1}-Then we have no choice.

331
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,185
{\an1}-Lightning Style, Earth Flash!

332
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:20,153
-Aargh!

333
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:23,021
Aah, aah.

334
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:24,022
-Utakata!

335
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:27,359
{\an1}-This isn't personal,
I promise you.

336
00:19:27,392 --> 00:19:29,760
{\an1}But it's essential that we
take him back to our village.

337
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,229
{\an1}-Must you be so cruel?

338
00:19:31,262 --> 00:19:32,663
Stop it, please!

339
00:19:32,697 --> 00:19:34,131
-Don't worry.

340
00:19:34,165 --> 00:19:35,433
{\an1}This isn't going to kill him.

341
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,168
{\an1}We're just draining a little
of his strength, that's all.

342
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:39,102
-Aargh!

343
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,570
{\an1}-Please, he's had enough!

344
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:43,973
{\an1}What could he have done to
deserve to be treated this way?

345
00:19:44,006 --> 00:19:45,307
{\an1}-A monstrous crime.

346
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:49,077
{\an1}He killed his own master and
then fled from the village.

347
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,745
-What?

348
00:19:50,778 --> 00:19:52,313
{\an1}-We need to restrain him.

349
00:19:52,347 --> 00:19:54,315
{\an1}Get started on trying him up.

350
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:55,782
MEN: Yes, sir.

-What?

354
00:20:05,524 --> 00:20:08,394
{\an1}UTAKATA (VOICEOVER): What?

355
00:20:08,427 --> 00:20:11,763
{\an1}-You got some nerve holding
her hostage like that.

356
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:12,264
-Naruto!

357
00:20:17,435 --> 00:20:19,336
{\an1}-Sorry, if I kept you waiting.

{\an1}NARUTO: Back off!

00:21:57,252 --> 00:21:59,355
{\an1}Let her go, you bastards!

{\an1}SAI: Wait, Naruto.

362
00:22:00,422 --> 00:22:02,091
{\an1}NARUTO: Why are you
telling me to stop?

363
00:22:02,124 --> 00:22:02,957
{\an1}SAI: Their masks.

364
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,359
{\an1}They're Tracking ninja.

365
00:22:04,392 --> 00:22:06,060
{\an1}They're not after Hotaru.

366
00:22:06,094 --> 00:22:08,229
{\an1}They must want Utakata.

367
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:11,666
{\an1}He's a rogue ninja of the Mist
who's listed in the Bingo Book.

368
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:13,200
-What?

00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:15,168
Next time on
"Naruto Shippuden"--

{\an1}"Rogue Ninja's Past."

{\an1}What happened to him?
