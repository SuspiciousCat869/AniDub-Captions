1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,835
You once told me
that you're nobody.

2
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:14,003
That you don't
want to be anybody.

3
00:00:14,037 --> 00:00:15,672
No, stop it!

4
00:00:15,705 --> 00:00:17,473
{\an1}Don't step into my thoughts!

5
00:00:22,443 --> 00:00:24,811
{\an1}But the truth is that
you wanted to be

6
00:00:24,844 --> 00:00:26,513
{\an1}Hokage, just like me.

7
00:00:27,146 --> 00:00:31,182
{\an1}It could've even ended up
being the case that I was

8
00:00:31,215 --> 00:00:34,885
{\an1}chasing after your shadow
since becoming Hokage has

9
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:36,819
{\an1}always been my dream.

10
00:00:38,654 --> 00:00:40,955
I threw away the
past and my naïve self!

11
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:42,490
Don't say-

12
00:00:42,524 --> 00:00:44,891
{\an1}Then tell me why I'm
able to see this!

13
00:00:44,924 --> 00:00:48,328
{\an1}You can hide behind a
mask, but it's pointless.

14
00:00:49,294 --> 00:00:52,163
You were Kakashi
Sensei's friend, my dad's

15
00:00:52,196 --> 00:00:58,101
{\an1}subordinate, an Uchiha like
Sasuke, my senior, and a

16
00:00:58,134 --> 00:01:01,903
{\an1}Leaf shinobi who shared
the same dream as me.

17
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:04,205
{\an1}What is all this?!

18
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:05,406
Just tell me...

19
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,074
What is it that
you want with me?!

20
00:01:09,308 --> 00:01:12,177
{\an1}I want to remind you
that you're Obito Uchiha.

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,649
{\an1}I told you that I'd tear
that mask right off your

22
00:01:19,682 --> 00:01:21,384
face, remember?!

23
00:03:10,058 --> 00:03:11,860
Obito Uchiha?

24
00:03:11,894 --> 00:03:13,795
What meaning is
there in that name or

25
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:16,696
{\an1}in that existence now?

26
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,899
{\an1}I've merged with Ten Tails.

27
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:22,567
{\an1}And I have transcended
and attained enlightenment.

28
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,302
{\an1}I am no longer human.

29
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:30,840
{\an1}I shall lead mankind
into its next stage.

30
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:34,175
{\an1}I possess the same
will and body as the

31
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,877
{\an1}Sage of Six Paths.

32
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,044
{\an1}I am the Second Sage!

33
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:39,045
Wrong!

34
00:03:39,078 --> 00:03:40,680
{\an1}You are Obito Uchiha!

35
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:44,382
When our chakra
touched earlier, I saw

36
00:03:44,415 --> 00:03:45,917
into your past.

37
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,519
{\an1}Our personal histories
and our dream of being

38
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:51,387
{\an1}Hokage are the same.

39
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:53,556
{\an1}Almost exactly the same...

40
00:03:55,023 --> 00:03:57,491
{\an1}Neither of us knew our
parents, and we both lost

41
00:03:57,524 --> 00:03:59,493
{\an1}people precious to us.

42
00:04:00,326 --> 00:04:03,429
{\an1}Which is why you tried to
scare me by saying solitude

43
00:04:03,463 --> 00:04:05,297
{\an1}is my worst nightmare.

44
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,933
{\an1}At the start, you wanted
to be acknowledged

45
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:10,835
{\an1}and praised by others, too!

46
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,703
{\an1}I bet that's why you
wanted to be Hokage.

47
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:17,271
I mean if you're
the same as me...

48
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,271
{\an1}But look at you now!

49
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:09,307
{\an1}You've made all shinobi
your enemy and spout

50
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:11,943
{\an1}nonsense that it's for
the world's sake!

51
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:15,411
{\an1}When really, you're
only doing it for yourself!

52
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:19,081
{\an1}Not one person, not even
those precious to you, would

53
00:05:19,114 --> 00:05:21,516
{\an1}ever acknowledge this
current dream of yours.

54
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,487
You used to have
the same dream as me.

55
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:30,756
Now you're the
opposite of a Hokage!

56
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:33,525
{\an1}It's 'cause you're
just like me that-

57
00:05:33,558 --> 00:05:35,759
{\an1}No, it's because of that.

58
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:39,228
{\an1}That's why I wanted
to see you despair

59
00:05:39,262 --> 00:05:40,763
{\an1}about this world.

60
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:46,433
{\an1}Or I suppose I wanted to
feel again for myself that

61
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:51,503
{\an1}the path which I've chosen
for myself is not a mistake.

62
00:05:53,672 --> 00:05:56,707
{\an1}When I was battling against
you, you made me recall

63
00:05:56,741 --> 00:05:58,608
{\an1}myself from my youth.

64
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:01,143
That's why
wanted to test you.

65
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:08,282
{\an1}To see when you would fall
into despair and reject your

66
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:09,983
{\an1}feelings and past...

67
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,719
{\an1}It's because we're so alike
that you really annoy me!

68
00:06:14,753 --> 00:06:15,620
Get it?!

69
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:19,289
{\an1}You're just abandoning
everything and running away!

70
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:20,890
No...

71
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:23,659
What I'm doing's
no different than

72
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:25,394
{\an1}a Hokage's actions.

73
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:27,428
More, in fact.

74
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:31,097
For I can truly
bring about peace.

75
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:41,772
{\an1}Are you serious right now?

76
00:06:42,438 --> 00:06:43,439
You?

77
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:48,677
You really,
truly believe that?

78
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:03,420
{\an1}Hey, you know, Rin, if you
really think about it, you

79
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:06,155
{\an1}saving me is pretty much
the exact same thing as you

80
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:08,057
{\an1}saving the whole world!

81
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:09,390
Huh?

82
00:07:09,424 --> 00:07:13,093
{\an1}'Cause I mean, I'm gonna
become Hokage and I'll bring

83
00:07:13,126 --> 00:07:15,028
{\an1}this war to an end, right?

84
00:07:15,328 --> 00:07:17,530
And for me to do
that, I have to stay

85
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:20,432
{\an1}alive and healthy.

86
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,668
{\an1}Get what I'm saying?

87
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:26,636
Mm-hmm!

88
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:27,804
{\an1}It kinda makes sense...

89
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:31,339
{\an1}So, it's like this-
How do I put it...

90
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:36,676
{\an1}I mean, if you don't
stay close and keep

91
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,410
a watch over me.

92
00:07:38,444 --> 00:07:39,778
Well...

93
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,450
{\an1}It's just- [gasp]

94
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:52,152
{\an1}Y- You got so close
to me all of a sudden!

95
00:07:52,454 --> 00:07:54,355
Don't scare me
like that, Rin!

96
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,357
{\an1}You said to stay close
and keep watch over you!

97
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,691
[giggle]

98
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:04,328
{\an1}Yeah, I guess I did.

99
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:05,963
{\an1}So watch over me!

100
00:08:07,197 --> 00:08:09,032
{\an1}'Cause I'm gonna wear
the Uchiha crest...

101
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:11,900
{\an1}And become Hokage!

102
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,338
Right!

103
00:08:28,244 --> 00:08:29,612
Yes, I do...

104
00:08:29,947 --> 00:08:31,146
{\an1}That's how I feel.

105
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:34,950
{\an1}There's no need to
voluntarily walk a rugged

106
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:38,284
{\an1}path, whose destination
isn't even clear.

107
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,421
And step over
comrades' corpses.

108
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:45,156
{\an1}So, any person who's
sensible would choose a

109
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:47,525
shortcut with a
fixed outcome.

110
00:08:48,558 --> 00:08:49,726
That's right...

111
00:08:50,093 --> 00:08:51,962
{\an1}The goal a Hokage
should seek is to

112
00:08:51,995 --> 00:08:54,030
{\an1}create world peace.

113
00:08:55,363 --> 00:08:57,565
{\an1}You don't know what
you're talking about.

114
00:08:58,232 --> 00:09:00,634
{\an1}What I want to know isn't
the shortcut or the easy

115
00:09:00,668 --> 00:09:04,070
path, but how to
navigate the rugged one!

116
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:12,109
{\an1}Would you still say that
even if both of those paths

117
00:09:12,143 --> 00:09:15,011
{\an1}led to the same place?

118
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:18,312
{\an1}But in the beginning, how
can you tell which one is

119
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:19,914
the rugged path?

120
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:22,616
{\an1}I mean, you never really
know until someone

121
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,183
{\an1}starts walking down it!

122
00:09:24,517 --> 00:09:26,686
{\an1}A Hokage is the one who
walks ahead of everyone

123
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:29,254
else, enduring
their own pain.

124
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:31,955
{\an1}So that's why a Hokage
never walks over

125
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,024
{\an1}his comrades' corpses.

126
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:37,459
{\an1}There's no shortcut
to becoming Hokage!

127
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:40,896
{\an1}And no way out for the
one who becomes Hokage!

128
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:42,563
Correct?

129
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:55,906
{\an1}Oh man, oh man, oh man!

130
00:09:56,272 --> 00:09:58,307
This is the one
day I can't be late!

131
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:23,192
{\an1}You're even late to
the entrance ceremony?!

132
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:26,359
{\an1}Someone like you has
no business being

133
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,928
{\an1}in the Academy at all.

134
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,361
You'll fail out.

135
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,996
It's okay.

136
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,064
Huh?

137
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,133
{\an1}Since you weren't there,
I picked this up for you.

138
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:37,000
For me?

139
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:38,334
Yeah!

140
00:10:39,502 --> 00:10:41,137
{\an1}Just submit this packet, and
you'll be able to enroll!

141
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:42,971
Wow, thank you!

142
00:10:43,305 --> 00:10:44,472
{\an1}You're a lifesaver!

143
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:47,141
{\an1}You know, if you keep
pampering him, then he'll

144
00:10:47,174 --> 00:10:48,909
never get over
his tardiness.

145
00:10:49,242 --> 00:10:50,410
Hey, shut up!

146
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:51,577
{\an1}You wanna fight?!

147
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,578
Say that again!

148
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:53,612
What?!

149
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:55,013
{\an1}It's your own fault!

150
00:10:55,313 --> 00:10:56,347
[chuckle]

151
00:10:56,647 --> 00:10:58,715
{\an1}What did you say?!
Stupid Kakashi!

152
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,577
A perfect score!

153
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:41,779
[cheering]

154
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:04,461
{\an1}Are you trying to kill me?!

155
00:12:04,795 --> 00:12:06,729
Sorry, sir!

156
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:09,297
[laughter]

157
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:16,769
Now begin!

158
00:12:42,587 --> 00:12:43,621
Stop!

159
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:04,602
Yes, sir!

160
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,472
Um, uh, hold on,
let me see here...

161
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:10,639
{\an1}I didn't call on you.

162
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:11,841
{\an1}What's the matter?!

163
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,474
[laughter]

164
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:31,554
What?!

165
00:13:31,588 --> 00:13:33,589
Kakashi's taking
the graduation exam?

166
00:13:33,622 --> 00:13:34,656
Mm-hm!

167
00:13:35,324 --> 00:13:37,159
But he's the
same age as we are!

168
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,894
{\an1}He's so brilliant that
they're going to

169
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:41,195
{\an1}let him skip a level!

170
00:13:41,229 --> 00:13:43,263
{\an1}He should be taking
the exam right now!

171
00:13:43,296 --> 00:13:44,463
Damn it!

172
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:46,031
[gasp]

173
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:14,251
-[gasp]
-He did it!

174
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:15,517
Yes!

175
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,719
{\an1}Excellent job, Kakashi!

176
00:14:21,823 --> 00:14:23,690
Hey, what's
with the headband?

177
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:25,225
That means that
you passed it!

178
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:26,425
Congratulations!

179
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:27,827
Thanks.

180
00:14:31,096 --> 00:14:32,063
Well?

181
00:14:32,097 --> 00:14:33,964
Aren't you going
to congratulate me?

182
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,199
Yeah, right!

183
00:14:35,232 --> 00:14:37,200
{\an1}I'm gonna catch up
with you in no time!

184
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:38,800
Just you wait!

185
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,371
Hmph!

186
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:46,473
Obito...

187
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:04,752
Class is going
to start soon.

188
00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:05,786
Let's go.

189
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:09,555
Rin...

190
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:14,926
{\an1}Please, just-- just keep
watching over me, okay?

191
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,494
Uh, what?

192
00:15:18,862 --> 00:15:19,896
I...

193
00:15:20,863 --> 00:15:22,398
{\an1}I'll catch up to him.

194
00:15:23,098 --> 00:15:24,899
And then I'll
surpass him and...

195
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:28,302
I'll become
Hokage, no matter what!

196
00:15:31,904 --> 00:15:33,471
Don't worry.

197
00:15:33,872 --> 00:15:35,040
{\an1}I'll be watching.

198
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:39,009
All right!

199
00:15:40,044 --> 00:15:41,277
I'll do my best!

200
00:16:42,786 --> 00:16:43,988
It's no good...

201
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:45,989
{\an1}What's the point?!

202
00:16:46,356 --> 00:16:47,956
{\an1}Of course I totally failed!

203
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,424
Damn it.

204
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,625
I still can't
catch up to him!

205
00:16:55,595 --> 00:16:57,763
[sigh]

206
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,935
What am I going
to say to Rin?

207
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:12,907
{\an1}Ah, so this is where
you ran off to, huh?

208
00:17:12,941 --> 00:17:15,042
I had no idea
where you went!

209
00:17:15,342 --> 00:17:17,411
{\an1}Oh, sorry about that.

210
00:17:17,777 --> 00:17:19,412
{\an1}Got something for you.

211
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,047
Here!

212
00:17:22,347 --> 00:17:23,647
Huh?

213
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,250
Does this mean?

214
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:28,918
Congratulations!

215
00:17:28,952 --> 00:17:30,686
This means that
starting today, you're

216
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,087
{\an1}a full-fledged shinobi!

217
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:38,657
I did it!

218
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:39,925
However!

219
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,395
{\an1}The difficult days as a
Genin are just starting!

220
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,295
Right.

221
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,295
Yes, sir!

222
00:17:45,363 --> 00:17:47,432
{\an1}Hereafter, you will be
part of a three-man squad.

223
00:17:47,465 --> 00:17:50,199
{\an1}Each group has a Jonin in
command, and you'll fulfill

224
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:51,934
{\an1}your missions as a team.

225
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:17,285
Pardon me, sir?

226
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:22,222
You summoned me?

227
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:24,723
I want to ask a
favor of you.

228
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,792
{\an1}The one who just left here.

229
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,194
{\an1}Isn't he Kakashi Hatake?

230
00:18:30,227 --> 00:18:31,362
That's right.

231
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:34,830
{\an1}He's the orphaned son of
Sakumo Hatake, the White

232
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,298
{\an1}Fang of the Leaf.

233
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,666
{\an1}Is there some kind
of issue with him?

234
00:18:38,699 --> 00:18:41,235
Kakashi's an
extremely talented shinobi.

235
00:18:42,102 --> 00:18:45,071
{\an1}However, he can be much too
fussy about sticking to the

236
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:48,706
{\an1}rules, and on top of that he
also frequently clashes with

237
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,774
his superiors
and his teammates.

238
00:18:54,244 --> 00:18:56,345
{\an1}He may excel in technique.

239
00:18:56,379 --> 00:18:59,347
{\an1}But as a person, I'm
afraid he has much to learn.

240
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:03,650
{\an1}His father broke the rules
to protect his comrades and

241
00:19:03,683 --> 00:19:05,452
{\an1}then took his own life.

242
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:07,520
Seems his death
has cast quite a long

243
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:09,587
{\an1}shadow over Kakashi.

244
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:13,257
You want me to
supervise him?

245
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,926
I know what you
want to say to me.

246
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:21,062
{\an1}But our village has lost
many Jonin and Chunin due to

247
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:23,831
{\an1}the long war in which
we've been embroiled.

248
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:26,999
{\an1}I can only make so
many allowances.

249
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:30,203
{\an1}But now I must send the
young ones off to war.

250
00:19:33,771 --> 00:19:34,972
I understand.

251
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:40,242
Good grief!

252
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,311
{\an1}How long are you going
to keep me waiting?!

253
00:19:42,677 --> 00:19:43,945
I'm so sorry!

254
00:19:44,312 --> 00:19:45,580
{\an1}He'll be here shortly.

255
00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:46,847
He's late.

256
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,215
As usual!

257
00:19:48,582 --> 00:19:50,116
Oh, don't worry!

258
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:51,283
{\an1}He'll be here soon!

259
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:53,151
You're too easy
on him, Rin.

260
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:01,124
Sorry I'm late!

261
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:05,160
Rin?

262
00:20:05,193 --> 00:20:05,993
[giggling]

263
00:20:06,026 --> 00:20:07,660
{\an1}No surprise there!

264
00:20:07,694 --> 00:20:09,696
How is it that
you never learn?!

265
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,364
What's that?!

266
00:20:11,397 --> 00:20:12,599
Whoa, there!

267
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:14,099
Okay, guys.

268
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:15,601
{\an1}Cut it out, all right?

269
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:18,269
Mr. Genzou is
tired of waiting, so

270
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:19,970
{\an1}hurry and line up.

271
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,007
{\an1}All right, now look at me!

272
00:20:27,908 --> 00:20:28,709
{\an1}[annoyed harrumph]

273
00:20:28,742 --> 00:20:29,743
[chuckle]

274
00:20:29,776 --> 00:20:31,345
Come on. It's a
commemorative photo.

275
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:32,479
{\an1}Look at the camera!!

276
00:22:57,144 --> 00:23:00,681
{\an1}You just couldn't discard
the memories of my dad,

277
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:04,984
{\an1}Kakashi Sensei, or
this Rin, could you?

278
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:08,653
You tried to run
away from everything.

279
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,222
{\an1}I bet this Rin person
would say this if

280
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:13,724
{\an1}she were still alive.

281
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:18,826
{\an1}Next time on Naruto
Shippuden: "I'm Always
Watching."

282
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,596
"I am always
watching, you know..."
