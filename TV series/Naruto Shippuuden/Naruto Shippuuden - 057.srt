[wind starts blowing]

4
00:02:12,856 --> 00:02:14,325
-Huh?

5
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:14,727
Uh.

6
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:31,664
-Hey!

7
00:02:31,697 --> 00:02:32,399
What are you doing?

8
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:34,169
Hurry up, will ya'?

9
00:02:34,203 --> 00:02:35,572
We're going to leave you behind.

10
00:02:38,545 --> 00:02:39,681
-(THINKING) Is he trembling?

11
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:48,667
-Unh!

12
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,438
(WHISPERING) Oh.

13
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:54,212
[laughs] (THINKING) I can
totally train on a mission

14
00:02:54,246 --> 00:02:56,584
if I really try.

15
00:02:56,584 --> 00:02:57,954
-(THINKING) Of course!

16
00:02:58,188 --> 00:02:58,856
He must be scared.

17
00:03:01,695 --> 00:03:03,800
-Huh?

18
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:07,875
-(THINKING) It was that
conversation last night.

19
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:08,978
NARUTO: Come on.

20
00:03:09,212 --> 00:03:10,949
What could be taking
Captain Yamato so long?

21
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,352
-I know, right?

22
00:03:12,352 --> 00:03:13,721
I wonder where he went off to.

23
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:14,423
[rustling brush]

24
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:16,762
-(ALL TOGETHER) Hm?

25
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:17,530
NARUTO: Ah!

26
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:18,499
You finally showed up!

27
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:26,215
Yikes!

28
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:27,986
-[laughing]

29
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:29,256
-Uh.

30
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:32,228
Captain Yamato, don't
scare us like that.

31
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:32,930
-Ah, sorry.

32
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:34,534
Sorry, I couldn't resist.

33
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:35,636
-Ah.

34
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:37,340
Believe me, you're scary
enough without putting

35
00:03:37,373 --> 00:03:39,511
on some kind of spooky act.

36
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,382
-[laughs] Well, what can I say?

37
00:03:41,415 --> 00:03:43,319
You're an easy target, Naruto.

38
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:44,656
-Ah.

39
00:03:44,656 --> 00:03:47,796
Anyway, Captain, back to what
we were talking about earlier.

40
00:03:47,796 --> 00:03:50,936
Why would anyone want
to rob from a grave?

41
00:03:50,936 --> 00:03:51,871
It's awful.

42
00:03:51,904 --> 00:03:53,041
-It is.

43
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,780
Often the graves of wealthy
people are targeted.

44
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,319
Thieves try to steal any
valuable objects buried

45
00:03:58,352 --> 00:03:59,554
in the tomb.

46
00:03:59,588 --> 00:04:02,294
But in these robberies, the
bodies and the treasures

47
00:04:02,328 --> 00:04:03,730
were undisturbed.

48
00:04:03,764 --> 00:04:05,567
It's a very troubling case.

49
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:08,040
Every robbery has
happened in the same area,

50
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:10,780
all within five kilometers
of the Fire Temple, where

51
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:11,948
we're all headed now.

52
00:04:11,948 --> 00:04:13,017
NARUTO: The Fire Temple?

53
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:14,454
-Mm-hm.

54
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,425
They hired us for this mission.

55
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:18,496
Catching thieves is
a simple-enough job,

56
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,402
but they specifically
wanted Leaf Village ninja.

57
00:04:21,436 --> 00:04:24,743
So something tells me
there's more to it than that.

58
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:26,580
As a matter of
fact, I've learned

59
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:29,420
there are four hidden tombs
in the area around the temple.

60
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:31,791
-Do you think there's any chance
the grave robbers could've

61
00:04:31,825 --> 00:04:33,796
been targeting
those hidden tombs?

62
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,665
-Mm-hm.

63
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:36,302
There's a strong possibility.

64
00:04:36,335 --> 00:04:37,704
-What's up with
these hidden tombs?

65
00:04:37,704 --> 00:04:39,441
What are they?

66
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:41,446
YAMATO: Even in death,
the body of a ninja

67
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:43,584
contains a wealth
of information.

68
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,991
To some, that knowledge
is a goldmine.

69
00:04:47,024 --> 00:04:48,661
Remember your fight with Sasori?

70
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:52,604
--[gasp] He turned the body of
the third Kazekage into one

71
00:04:52,637 --> 00:04:54,741
of his puppets.

72
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:56,011
YAMATO: That's right.

73
00:04:56,044 --> 00:05:00,053
The more powerful the ninja was,
the more useful they can be.

74
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:02,726
In order to protect the tombs
from thieves and raiders,

75
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,663
barriers are often
set up, and they're

76
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:06,902
built in secret locations.

77
00:05:06,935 --> 00:05:08,872
That's what we'll
be dealing with.

78
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:11,011
-So I guess some
really amazing ninja

79
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,750
must be resting inside
those hidden tombs, huh?

80
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,485
-Indeed.

81
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:16,055
Especially these four.

82
00:05:16,088 --> 00:05:19,829
The information they hold
is incredibly valuable.

83
00:05:19,863 --> 00:05:21,098
-That' crazy!

84
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:25,107
-On the other hand, something
else could be going on here.

85
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:27,713
It's quite possible
that the tombs

86
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:29,851
weren't desecrated
from the outside.

87
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:31,388
-Huh?

88
00:05:31,388 --> 00:05:35,129
YAMATO: In other words, those
bodies came back from the dead!

89
00:05:35,363 --> 00:05:35,965
-Yah! [gasps]

90
00:05:35,998 --> 00:05:37,501
-Kidding!

91
00:05:37,535 --> 00:05:39,606
[laughs]

92
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,775
-(THINKING) Yes.

93
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,813
Naruto must have believed
Captain Yamato's story.

94
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:50,396
-(THINKING) I can
do it! [inhales]

95
00:05:57,746 --> 00:05:58,113
-Nuh.

96
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,535
OK.

97
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,738
This is the rendezvous point.

98
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,949
A group from the
Fire Temple will

99
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,023
be arriving here
to meet us shortly.

100
00:06:18,057 --> 00:06:20,962
[high-pitched buzzing]

00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:27,209

--[chuckling]
[fake yawn] Oh, man.

103
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:33,790
I'm tired, too.

104
00:06:33,824 --> 00:06:35,661
Got to take a load off.

105
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:36,831
Unh. [sigh]

106

111
00:06:47,855 --> 00:06:48,656
Take it easy.

112
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,594
No yelling.

113
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:51,129
(THINKING) Yeah.

114
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:52,498
He's definitely scared.

115
00:06:58,144 --> 00:06:59,513
-The client's late.

116
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:01,150
What, did we stop at
the wrong landmark?

117
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,762
I'm going to go look over there.

118
00:07:06,762 --> 00:07:07,798
-All right.

119
00:07:07,831 --> 00:07:08,901
I'll go with you.

120
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:09,501
-What?

121
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:10,036
Wait!

122
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:12,675
I'm going too.

123
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,544
-No.

124
00:07:13,577 --> 00:07:15,014
You and Sai need to stay put.

125
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:17,653
Otherwise, we might miss
the group if they show up.

126
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:18,221
-Mm-mm.

127
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:19,890
Well, all right then.

128
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:20,525
-Don't worry.

129
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:20,926
-(WHISPER) Huh?

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,128

here with you, Naruto.

about something, gently

their shoulder, let them
know they're not alone,

and show them some tenderness.

Hm.

-Dah!

Heh.

144
00:08:32,883 --> 00:08:33,918
Huh.

than I thought.

What are you doing?

you some tenderness?

-(YELLING) Well,l just don't OK?

Hold on.

about the rendezvous location,
so we missed each other.

00:19:13,076 --> 00:19:14,379
when they're talking to you.

340
00:19:14,413 --> 00:19:16,818
I'm asking about
that jutsu of yours.

341
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:18,855
It came from this
hand, didn't it?

342
00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:20,058
-Don't touch me!

343
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,530
-[growls]

344
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:27,407
-[scoffs]

345
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:28,677
-What a jerk.

346
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:38,398
-Oh.

347
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:39,133
-Argh!

348
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,970
(WEARILY) Are we
almost there yet?

349
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:47,418
Huh?

350
00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:55,426
[exhales]

351
00:20:13,174 --> 00:20:15,479
I've seen this place before.

352
00:20:15,512 --> 00:20:16,781
In a dream.

353
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:31,714
[ending theme music]

354
00:22:00,608 --> 00:22:01,643
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Urrh!

355
00:22:01,676 --> 00:22:02,712
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
What's up, Naruto?

356
00:22:02,745 --> 00:22:04,115
What are you so annoyed about?

357
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:05,986
-It's that Sora guy.

358
00:22:05,986 --> 00:22:07,255
The way he's moving.

359
00:22:07,288 --> 00:22:09,193
It's like he's
pretending to train.

360
00:22:09,226 --> 00:22:10,730
Just going through the motions.

361
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:11,732
What's up with that?

362
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:12,734
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Really?

363
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:14,036
It looks like he's
training pretty hard.

364
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:15,908
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
That's not what I meant!

365
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:19,215
Ah, it's just that compared to
before when he fought me, ahh!

366
00:22:19,248 --> 00:22:20,150
That does it.

367
00:22:20,184 --> 00:22:21,719
I'm going to tell
him what's what.

368
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:22,154
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Huh?

369
00:22:22,154 --> 00:22:23,613
Wait!

370
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:24,193
Hey, Naruto!

371
00:22:24,193 --> 00:22:26,663
For crying out
loud, get back here!

372
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:29,299
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Next time, Loneliness.
