{\an1}Hum-mum...

3
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:30,864
{\an1}Huh?

4
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:35,002
{\an1}Mina, you really like
that melody don't you.

5
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:37,571
{\an1}Did you compose
it yourself?

6
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:38,874
<i>I hear it.</i>

7
00:00:38,907 --> 00:00:41,109
{\an1}Hmm. You hear it?

8
00:00:46,282 --> 00:00:47,517
<i>You're so weird!</i>

9
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,252
Hey!

10
00:00:49,186 --> 00:00:52,923
{\an1}Whoa. Is this
Sensei? It's
not even close.

11
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:55,492
{\an1}I'm just not done
yet! Give it back!

12
00:00:55,526 --> 00:00:56,660
{\an1}Sure, just take it!

13
00:00:56,694 --> 00:00:57,729
<i>You're being mean!</i>

14
00:00:57,762 --> 00:00:58,730
{\an1}<i>Can't reach it?</i>

15
00:00:58,763 --> 00:00:59,831
(angry growl)

16
00:00:59,864 --> 00:01:00,865
{\an1}Leo!

17
00:01:04,136 --> 00:01:07,307
{\an1}Dokku Sensei, huh?
And is he doing well?

18
00:01:07,341 --> 00:01:08,507
{\an1}Mm-hmm!

19
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,011
He's like this!

20
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:13,013
{\an1}He's gotten bigger?

21
00:01:13,046 --> 00:01:15,615
<i>But he's cute</i>
<i>like a teddy bear!</i>

22
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:16,751
{\an1}Huh?!

23
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:18,853
Nice and soft!

24
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:20,888
{\an1}More like big
and bigger!

25
00:01:20,922 --> 00:01:22,523
(chuckling)

26
00:01:22,557 --> 00:01:23,592
Do you like him?

27
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,226
Yeah!

28
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:25,527
{\an1}A lot!

29
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:27,330
Oh, I see!

30
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:35,006
{\an1}<i>Well, then. It seems</i>
<i>he's more suited to</i>
<i>this than being a guard.</i>

31
00:01:45,584 --> 00:01:46,419
(shocked gasp)

32
00:01:51,724 --> 00:01:52,825
(shocked gasp)

33
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,341
(scared gasps)

34
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,345
{\an1}<i>Get inside and hide!</i>

35
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,315
{\an1}<i>Leo! Where's</i>
<i>Grandpa!</i>

36
00:02:20,658 --> 00:02:22,660
{\an1}(painful screams)

37
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:29,768

40
00:03:22,296 --> 00:03:23,398
{\an1}Ahh!

41
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:34,944
{\an1}I don't wanna die!

42
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:38,182
{\an1}(hysterical crying)

43
00:03:38,215 --> 00:03:42,287
{\an1}<i>Help us! Someone,</i>

{\an1}<i>Leo? Leo! Leo!</i>

46
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,934
{\an7}Dokku Sensei!

47
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,137
{\an3}<i>Leo!</i>

48
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:58,438
Help, Sensei!

49
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,273
{\an1}Mina!

50
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:06,515
{\an1}Just jump down!
I'll catch you!

51
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:10,319
{\an1}Come on! Hurry!

52
00:04:13,055 --> 00:04:14,157
{\an3}No!

53
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:16,626
{\an1}Mina, please! You
have to hurry!

54
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,128
But I'm scared!

55
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:20,897
(worried sigh)

56
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:23,968
{\an1}Mina, please!

57
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:26,305
{\an1}Look, do you hate me?

58
00:04:30,008 --> 00:04:31,710
{\an1}You can't trust me?

59
00:04:34,314 --> 00:04:36,584
{\an1}All right! Then
come on! Be brave!

60
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,689
{\an3}Oh...

61
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,338
{\an1}Well done!

62
00:04:55,371 --> 00:04:56,806
{\an1}You're amazing!

63
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:01,378
{\an1}Leo! Your turn!

64
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:11,523
{\an1}(struggling breaths)

65
00:05:38,622 --> 00:05:39,623
{\an1}Huh?

66
00:05:39,657 --> 00:05:40,758
{\an1}(frightened gasp)

67
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,693
{\an1}Don't leave us!

68
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:52,471
{\an1}<i>There might still be</i>
<i>people in the village</i>
<i>that need help!</i>

69
00:05:54,974 --> 00:05:59,479
{\an1}What about Yoshi
and Satchi? If
they're there...

70
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:23,374
{\an4}Listen, if I don't
come back for some
reason, go to Hachou
Town. Understand?

71
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:24,675
Mm-hmm.

72
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:29,581
{\an4}When you get there
find some help. Go
to the town hall.
Got it?

73
00:06:29,614 --> 00:06:30,549
Mm-hmm.

74
00:06:30,816 --> 00:06:33,151
{\an1}And then...
And then...

75
00:06:37,557 --> 00:06:38,791
{\an1}<i>Do your best!</i>

76
00:06:56,212 --> 00:06:57,046
{\an1}Huh?

77
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:13,931
(startled gasp)

78
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,365
(chuckle)

79
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:21,845
(shocked gasp)

80
00:09:21,313 --> 00:09:22,180
{\an3}Huh?

81
00:09:44,774 --> 00:09:47,778
{\an1}(struggling breaths)

82
00:09:51,114 --> 00:09:54,117
{\an1}(struggling grunts)

83
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:15,448
(goofy laugh)

84
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:17,250
{\an1}Yeah! All right!

85
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:19,420
{\an1}Oh, man! It's been
forever since I've

86
00:12:19,453 --> 00:12:20,421
<i>been on a mission!</i>

87
00:12:20,454 --> 00:12:21,790
Naruto! Shut it!

88
00:12:21,823 --> 00:12:24,291
{\an1}The situation's nothing
to be happy about.

89
00:12:24,325 --> 00:12:25,193
{\an3}Huh?

90
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,365
{\an4}<i>There's been an incident</i>
<i>in an isolated village in</i>
<i>a small nation bordering</i>
<i>the Land of Fire.</i>

91
00:12:30,398 --> 00:12:32,835
{\an1}The inhabitants there
were all slaughtered.

92
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:33,269
(shocked gasps)

93
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:33,937
{\an3}What?!

94
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:40,511
{\an4}<i>Since ancient times, a</i>
<i>site there has been</i>
<i>reserved for sacred use.</i>
<i>It's known as "The Hole."</i>

95
00:12:40,544 --> 00:12:45,817
{\an4}<i>Rumors have often circulated</i>
<i>that it contains hidden</i>
<i>treasure, and apparently</i>
<i>defense measures were put in</i>

96
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,987
{\an1}<i>place to protect the</i>
<i>area from bandits.</i>

97
00:12:48,254 --> 00:12:50,990
<i>But still, total</i>
<i>annihilation?</i>

98
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:56,163
{\an4}I wish that I were able
to assign more people to
your team, but we have
issues to deal with within

99
00:12:56,196 --> 00:12:58,398
{\an1}our own village, too.

100
00:12:58,431 --> 00:13:01,334
{\an5}<i>You're referring to the</i>
<i>grave-robbing incident</i>
<i>that occurred right</i>
<i>outside the Hidden Leaf.</i>

101
00:13:01,368 --> 00:13:05,706
{\an4}<i>Yes, and also in the</i>
<i>forest where that</i>
<i>Akatsuki is sealed</i>
<i>away.</i>

102
00:13:06,675 --> 00:13:08,309
<i>Where his sickle</i>
<i>was stolen?</i>

103
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:13,049
{\an1}As you see, things
have become quite
hectic here.

104
00:13:13,082 --> 00:13:16,886
{\an1}But we can't ignore an
attack on the general
public like this.

105
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:21,959
{\an4}<i>Find the ones responsible</i>
<i>for attacking the village</i>
<i>and punish them. I'm</i>
<i>counting on you.</i>

106
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:23,527
Got it! Right!

107
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:34,807
{\an1}Everything's burned
to the ground.

108
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:38,846
{\an1}What kind of weapons
could the assailants
have used to do this?

109
00:13:45,553 --> 00:13:48,224
{\an1}Wow, look at this
amazing forest!

110
00:13:48,257 --> 00:13:51,660
{\an4}But if you just go
a little past here,
it's nothing but
barren land.

111
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:00,570
Is this the
treasure house?

112
00:14:00,604 --> 00:14:02,405
Hmmh. Let's
find out.

113
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:10,549
{\an1}<i>Looks like they're</i>
<i>pumping spring water</i>
<i>somewhere.</i>

114
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:22,730
{\an1}Why would someone
build this underground?

115
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:24,398
It's huge.

116
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:26,735
{\an1}What a bizarre
room.

117
00:14:29,305 --> 00:14:32,341
{\an1}There's nothing
here. Did the
robbers-?

118
00:14:32,574 --> 00:14:33,910
{\an7}<i>Looks that way...</i>

119
00:14:40,617 --> 00:14:41,652
{\an1}<i>Freeze!</i>

120
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:44,989
{\an8}Thought this would
be a good time to
pillage?

121
00:14:45,023 --> 00:14:49,961
{\an1}No. We're here because
we were asked to come.
By your own government.

122
00:14:49,995 --> 00:14:52,031
{\an1}We're shinobi
from the Leaf.

123
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:56,468
{\an1}Sorry about that.
We received word
you were coming.

124
00:14:57,904 --> 00:14:59,205
{\an1}Who are you?

125
00:14:59,706 --> 00:15:03,210
{\an1}We're from the neighboring
town of Hachou. We're a
security unit.

126
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,347
{\an1}My village and Tonika
have an alliance.

127
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:07,316
I see.

128
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:09,617
{\an1}Please come this way.

129
00:15:10,484 --> 00:15:12,287
{\an1}<i>There's someone</i>
<i>you should meet.</i>

130
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:16,893
{\an1}Shiseru...

131
00:15:18,895 --> 00:15:20,397
{\an1}Who might this be?

132
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:26,737
{\an7}<i>I see. I appreciate</i>
<i>your quick response.</i>

133
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:31,176
{\an1}My name is Disonasu,
I'm the head of
Hachou Village.

134
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:35,580
{\an4}<i>Yesterday, the few</i>
<i>who escaped death at</i>
<i>the hands of the</i>
<i>assailants</i>

135
00:15:35,613 --> 00:15:40,653
{\an4}came to our village
seeking asylum, and
<i>we became aware of</i>
<i>their situation.</i>

136
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:43,390
{\an7}<i>Do you have any idea</i>
<i>who the assailants</i>
<i>were?</i>

137
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:49,764
{\an8}<i>No, but I believe</i>
<i>bandits have attacked</i>
<i>the village on a number</i>
<i>of occasions in the past.</i>

138
00:15:49,797 --> 00:15:52,067
{\an8}<i>Lured by rumors of</i>
<i>treasure.</i>

139
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:54,303
{\an1}About this treasure?

140
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:56,305
{\an1}Do you know what
it's supposed to be?

141
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:57,039
(annoyed growl)

142
00:15:57,072 --> 00:15:58,208
No...

143
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:01,544
<i>I think only a select</i>
<i>few in the village</i>
<i>ever knew that.</i>

144
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,583
So in other words,
it looks like someone

145
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:08,152
{\an1}was hunted down
by something.

146
00:16:08,953 --> 00:16:12,623
Ahh! Man, this
water tastes great!

147
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,593
{\an1}Could you focus?

148
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:19,365
{\an1}<i>It is pretty here.</i>

149
00:16:26,473 --> 00:16:32,947
{\an4}<i>So this is "The Hole".</i>
<i>It's weird, it's like it</i>
<i>sucked up all the life</i>
<i>and energy around it.</i>

150
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:34,883
{\an1}It's so full
of vitality!

151
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:38,087
{\an1}Yes, you're right.

152
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,888
(startled gasp)

153
00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:41,291
{\an1}<i>This water's</i>
<i>overflowing</i>
<i>with life.</i>

154
00:16:41,324 --> 00:16:42,792
<i>Where'd you</i>
<i>come from?!</i>

155
00:16:43,994 --> 00:16:46,364
{\an1}It's been a
while, you two.

156
00:16:47,064 --> 00:16:47,898
(stunned gasp)

157
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:51,135
(sly chuckling)

158
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,704
{\an1}Kabuto...

159
00:16:56,775 --> 00:16:58,210
(chuckling)

160
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:02,581
(attacking yell)

161
00:17:08,655 --> 00:17:11,759
{\an1}<i>You just love getting</i>
<i>into fights, don't you?</i>

162
00:17:12,427 --> 00:17:14,763
What are you up to?
Why are you here?

163
00:17:14,796 --> 00:17:17,099
{\an1}Oh, just this
and that.

164
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:21,170
{\an1}See, I'm conducting
some research.

165
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:23,072
(shocked gasp)

166
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:28,345
(disgusted groan)

167
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:30,381
{\an1}What the hell is
all that stuff?

168
00:17:30,614 --> 00:17:37,122
{\an4}<i>I created these snakes</i>
<i>using Lord Orochimaru's</i>
<i>cells. Their regenerative</i>
<i>power is so strong that</i>

169
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:40,993
{\an4}<i>they can multiply a</i>
<i>remarkable amount in</i>
<i>practically no time</i>
<i>at all.</i>

170
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:47,502
{\an4}What's more, I'm able to
take the nucleus from the
cell of another being, and
successfully implant it

171
00:17:47,535 --> 00:17:51,906
{\an4}into these creatures.
And the snakes will
regenerate the genetic
data of the donor.

172
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:53,040
(confused groan)

173
00:17:55,511 --> 00:17:57,880
{\an1}But most fortuitously...

174
00:17:57,913 --> 00:18:02,619
{\an1}<i>This water seems to</i>
<i>accelerate cell division</i>
<i>to an extremely high rate.</i>

175
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:06,457
{\an1}<i>It's almost</i>
<i>like a virus.</i>

176
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,169
{\an1}Then at last...

177
00:18:18,036 --> 00:18:19,104
{\an1}<i>...birth!</i>

178
00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:23,809
{\an1}I've made a
new life!

179
00:18:26,746 --> 00:18:27,847
No way...

180
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,682
<i>He's that Akatsuki...</i>

181
00:18:30,884 --> 00:18:32,387
{\an1}That's right.

182
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,555
{\an1}Hidan!

183
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:39,060
{\an4}<i>I guess it's safe to</i>
<i>assume it's not just</i>
<i>a coincidence that</i>
<i>you're here.</i>

184
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:42,131
{\an1}You attacked the
village, didn't you?

185
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:48,104
{\an4}<i>Besides the reason</i>
<i>you're here, you're</i>
<i>going to tell us</i>
<i>a lot more.</i>

186
00:18:48,405 --> 00:18:51,041
{\an1}You think so, do you?

187
00:18:51,074 --> 00:18:52,577
{\an1}You won't escape.

188
00:18:54,712 --> 00:18:56,247
{\an1}I wonder...

189
00:18:56,981 --> 00:18:59,551
{\an1}You see, I have
other pawns.

190
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,721
(shocked gasp)

191
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,635
{\an1}Nagato?!

192
00:19:14,603 --> 00:19:15,537
{\an1}Itachi?!

193
00:19:15,869 --> 00:19:16,671
{\an1}<i>They're...</i>

194
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:17,973
{\an1}...from the Akatsuki!

195
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:19,241
{\an1}<i>Asuma and...</i>

196
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:20,710
{\an1}Hayate Sensei?!

197
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,477
{\an1}<i>Is this the...</i>

{\an1}Reanimation?!

199
00:19:22,811 --> 00:19:24,080
{\an1}Bastard!

200
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:25,748
{\an1}<i>You robbed</i>

201
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:26,782
(evil chuckle)

202
00:19:35,193 --> 00:19:36,060
Is that-?!

203
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,005
(chuckling)

204
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:47,540
This'll be fun!

205
00:19:47,574 --> 00:19:50,243
{\an1}Quit screwing
