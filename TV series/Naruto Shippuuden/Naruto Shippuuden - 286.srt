1
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:17,687
{\an7}The Hokage's faith in
you is awfully strong.
Have the two of you had
this bond for very long?

2
00:00:17,721 --> 00:00:21,189
{\an8}Yeah. A long time
ago I made Granny
a promise.

3
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:24,421
{\an8}I told her that I
wouldn't die until
I became Hokage.

4
00:00:24,622 --> 00:00:28,223
{\an7}That's an interesting
promise to keep. The
significance is deep.

5
00:00:28,257 --> 00:00:31,258
And that's just why
Granny decided to
bet on me!

6
00:00:31,957 --> 00:00:34,490
She even gave me a
symbol of my promise.

7
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:49,060
{\an4}<i>Just as Minato thought</i>
<i>he would! We need to let</i>
<i>Naruto go. That way, he</i>
<i>can protect the shinobi!</i>

8
00:00:49,094 --> 00:00:52,894
{\an1}I'm going to bet on
Naruto! So what about
you?

9
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:54,628
{\an1}<i>Tsunade...</i>

10
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:55,427
{\an3}Hm?

11
00:00:56,628 --> 00:00:58,896
{\an7}When did you first
decide to place all
your bets on Naruto?

12
00:00:59,495 --> 00:01:03,029
{\an7}Was it when he defeated
Pain and became the hero
of your village?

13
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,930
{\an1}Not then. It was
long before that.

14
00:01:06,297 --> 00:01:07,796
{\an1}It was when...

15
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:14,430
Playing at being
Hokage?

16
00:01:15,265 --> 00:01:17,431
{\an1}Count me out, it's
a fool's game.

17
00:01:18,698 --> 00:01:23,733
{\an4}<i>Ugh! I'm not gonna let</i>
<i>her sit there and make</i>
<i>fun of the old man!</i>
<i>No way!</i>

18
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:25,833
{\an1}I don't care if
she is a lady!

19
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:28,867
{\an1}<i>I'll knock that</i>
<i>cynical sneer off</i>
<i>her face!</i>

20
00:01:34,902 --> 00:01:35,868
{\an1}Darn it!

21
00:01:36,568 --> 00:01:37,002
{\an3}Hnh?

22
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:38,103
{\an1}Ahhh!

23
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:44,371
{\an1}<i>One question before</i>
<i>you pass out.</i>

24
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:48,703
{\an1}<i>Tell me, what makes</i>
<i>you so touchy about</i>
<i>Hokage?</i>

25
00:01:49,038 --> 00:01:51,804
{\an1}It's because, unlike
you, that's my goal.

26
00:01:52,272 --> 00:01:55,306
{\an1}Just watch someday
I'll be Hokage!

27
00:01:57,839 --> 00:02:00,806
{\an1}To be Hokage,
that is my dream!

28
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,673
(surprised gasp)

29
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:12,342
{\an1}<i>Well then, care to</i>
<i>make a bet on it?</i>

30
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:13,541
{\an1}A bet?

31
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:18,409
{\an7}I'll give you one
week. If you can
master that jutsu by
then, I'll admit I'm

32
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:23,144
{\an4}<i>wrong and that you're</i>
<i>worthy of becoming</i>
<i>Hokage. I'll even</i>
<i>throw in my necklace.</i>

33
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:26,111
{\an1}<i>Well, Naruto won</i>
<i>that bet.</i>

34
00:02:26,877 --> 00:02:30,045
<i>And so, you decided</i>
<i>to gamble on him,</i>
<i>is that it?</i>

35
00:02:30,078 --> 00:02:30,945
{\an1}Huh?

36
00:02:31,178 --> 00:02:32,778
{\an1}Yes. that's right.

37
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:41,014
{\an4}<i>But the first time we</i>
<i>met, you were making</i>
<i>an entirely different</i>
<i>type of wager.</i>

38
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:42,546
{\an1}<i>Do you remember?</i>

39
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:45,015
Huh? Ah-ha!

40
00:02:45,048 --> 00:02:46,948
Yeah, well back
in those days

41
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:49,447
<i>the only thing I</i>
<i>could bet on was</i>
<i>money...</i>

42
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,834
{\an8}<i>Lady Tsunade!</i>
<i>Please, wait</i>
<i>a second!</i>

43
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:41,969
{\an7}<i>Hurry up, Shizune!</i>
<i>The next den, I mean,</i>
<i>next inn, won't wait</i>
<i>for us!</i>

44
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:44,403
{\an8}<i>The inn isn't</i>
<i>going anywhere!</i>

45
00:04:44,902 --> 00:04:45,602
{\an1}Huh?

46
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,603
{\an1}Were they shinobi?

47
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:50,237
Lady Tsunade,
was that...

48
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,405
{\an1}Oh, forget it!
Let's go!

49
00:04:52,437 --> 00:04:53,637
(worried sigh)

50
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:13,440
{\an1}Wait, is that-?

51
00:05:13,473 --> 00:05:15,574
{\an1}You guys! You guys!

52
00:05:16,075 --> 00:05:17,008
What is it?!

53
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,176
{\an5}Zaji, if this is
something stupid
again, you're gonna
get it!

54
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:22,676
I promise you,
it's not stupid!
Look over there!

55
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:23,609
{\an8}Huh?

56
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:29,411
Whoa, look at
those...

57
00:05:31,577 --> 00:05:33,544
{\an1}<i>She's the legendary...</i>

58
00:05:33,577 --> 00:05:35,211
{\an1}The legendary
what?

59
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:36,712
{\an1}The legendary...

60
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:42,247
{\an1}The legendary what?!

61
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,479
You fool! You called us
out here because you
knew, didn't you?!

62
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:47,080
(chuckling)

63
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,881
{\an7}You got me! I just
wanted to liven things
up a little bit and
make you look good!

64
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:52,415
Hah! You idiot!
I ought to slam
you for that!

65
00:05:52,447 --> 00:05:53,915
{\an7}Yeah, but still,
you're smiling!

66
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:55,648
Well, yeah, of
course I am!

67
00:05:55,682 --> 00:05:57,648
(laughing)

68
00:05:57,682 --> 00:06:00,482
{\an1}Why shouldn't I smile?
She's the legendary...

69
00:06:01,116 --> 00:06:03,150
<i>Sucker!</i>

70
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:09,985
{\an1}And she's loaded!

71
00:06:10,018 --> 00:06:14,152
{\an1}Hah! Let's get going!
Change all of this
into tokens!

72
00:06:14,185 --> 00:06:17,153
{\an8}You got it! And
thank you for your
patronage, ma'am!

73
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:18,119
{\an1}What was that?

74
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,287
{\an4}Uh, don't mind us! Please,
why don't you just relax
and have a good time
while you're here!

75
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:26,654
{\an1}Yeah, just enjoy yourself!
You're here to have fun,
aren't you?!

76
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,454
(worried sigh)

77
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,554
{\an7}<i>She's being taken</i>
<i>advantage of already!</i>

78
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:43,157
{\an7}<i>There's no corpse,</i>
<i>so the enemy escaped.</i>

79
00:06:43,557 --> 00:06:47,624
Damn it all! It's
Nigai! They got him!

80
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,426
{\an1}<i>Yes, it's unfortunate</i>
<i>about Nigai...</i>

81
00:06:50,758 --> 00:06:53,025
(painful grunt)

82
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,527
{\an1}We've gotta hurry and
show this to Amai.

83
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:03,560
{\an1}<i>We've arranged to</i>
<i>meet up with him</i>
<i>at a nearby inn.</i>

84
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:07,661
I know you're in
pain, but do your
best to bear it!

85
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:11,396
{\an1}Sorry I've become a
burden. I'm so sorry,
sir!

86
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:14,595
Here we go!

87
00:07:16,296 --> 00:07:18,264
{\an1}<i>All right, place</i>
<i>your bets!</i>

88
00:07:18,297 --> 00:07:18,964
{\an1}<i>Even!</i>

89
00:07:18,997 --> 00:07:19,563
{\an3}<i>Even!</i>

90
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:20,197
{\an1}<i>Even!</i>

91
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,297
{\an1}Odd!

92
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,798
{\an1}<i>Snake eyes!</i>
<i>Even!</i>

93
00:07:24,798 --> 00:07:25,531
{\an3}<i>Odd!</i>

94
00:07:25,564 --> 00:07:26,432
{\an1}<i>Even!</i>

95
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:27,432
<i>Odd!</i>

96
00:07:27,464 --> 00:07:28,333
{\an3}Even!

97
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:33,766
{\an1}<i>Thank you so much</i>
<i>for stopping by!</i>

98
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:36,666
{\an1}<i>What on earth do</i>
<i>you think you're</i>
<i>doing now?!</i>

99
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,335
{\an4}I mean, you cannot go
into any more debt to
try to make your money
back!

100
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:42,734
Just go and borrow
some more for me,
all right?

101
00:07:42,767 --> 00:07:43,634
{\an1}But from where?!

102
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:45,336
Look, here they come.

103
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,235
{\an1}Huh?

104
00:07:47,235 --> 00:07:48,935
Is there a woman named
Tsunade staying here?

105
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,569
{\an1}You know, the one
with the huge jugs!

106
00:07:51,602 --> 00:07:53,536
Ehh! We'll find
her ourselves!

107
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:55,036
{\an1}What's the big
idea here!

108
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,071
{\an1}We're bill collectors!

109
00:07:57,404 --> 00:07:59,237
<i>Come on, let's</i>
<i>search the</i>
<i>whole joint!</i>

110
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,004
<i>Right!</i>

111
00:08:00,603 --> 00:08:01,471
{\an1}Ahhh!

112
00:08:01,504 --> 00:08:02,471
{\an1}Ahhh!

113
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:03,671
{\an1}Ahhh!

114
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:07,373
{\an1}Huh? Who are you?
Can I help you?

115
00:08:07,406 --> 00:08:11,173
{\an5}Well, I don't think
we need to bring
names into this, but
you can call us scary

116
00:08:11,206 --> 00:08:12,673
vultures from the
Land of Gold!

117
00:08:12,707 --> 00:08:13,907
{\an1}Listen, little girl...

118
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,140
{\an4}<i>Have you seen a</i>
<i>lady who looks</i>
<i>like this? I drew</i>
<i>it myself.</i>

119
00:08:17,174 --> 00:08:19,308
<i>She's got an</i>
<i>enormous chest.</i>

120
00:08:19,507 --> 00:08:23,742
{\an4}Oh, sure! That's the
pretty lady who's staying
in another room just down
the hallway!

121
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:24,842
<i>What?! Where?!</i>

122
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,443
{\an7}I'll go get
her for you!

123
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:33,609
Wait! Hold on a
minute, little
girl!

124
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:34,110
{\an1}<i>Huh?</i>

125
00:08:35,844 --> 00:08:37,944
{\an4}I've got a question
for you, what's that
shiny thing you have
there in your hand?

126
00:08:37,978 --> 00:08:39,345
{\an1}What? This?

127
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,545
{\an1}Oh! The pretty lady in
the picture you showed
me gave it to me earlier.

128
00:08:44,012 --> 00:08:47,980
{\an4}<i>She told me something</i>
<i>bad happened and she</i>
<i>went crazy up on the</i>
<i>mountain.</i>

129
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,082
{\an4}<i>She said that after that,</i>
<i>lots of sparkly stuff just</i>
<i>like this started coming</i>
<i>out of the rocks.</i>

130
00:08:57,115 --> 00:08:58,781
{\an1}What?! Lots, you say?!

131
00:08:58,815 --> 00:09:00,614
{\an1}Uh-huh!

132
00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:05,482
{\an4}<i>Lots and lots and lots!</i>
<i>She said there was so</i>
<i>much she couldn't carry</i>
<i>it all. So she gave some</i>

133
00:09:05,515 --> 00:09:06,350
{\an1}<i>to me, too!</i>

134
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:07,717
One second!

135
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,683
{\an1}<i>Okay!</i>

136
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,017
{\an7}The rock that brat
was holding, was a
piece of gold!

137
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,385
No way! Gold?!

138
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:16,484
{\an7}It seems that Tsunade
struck a mother load
up there on the mountain!

139
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:18,185
{\an8}You think so?

140
00:09:18,218 --> 00:09:19,286
<i>And that means...</i>

141
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:21,986
{\an1}<i>We'll lose out big time</i>
<i>if she pays off her debt!</i>

142
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,585
{\an1}And that means...

143
00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:27,454
{\an4}<i>We have to keep on</i>
<i>loaning her money so</i>
<i>we can rack up more</i>
<i>and more interest!</i>

144
00:09:27,853 --> 00:09:32,121
{\an4}<i>There's no way we'll</i>
<i>lose money on this! We</i>
<i>gotta keep letting her</i>
<i>borrow more and more!</i>

145
00:09:35,588 --> 00:09:40,055
{\an5}Oh my, if it isn't
the bill collectors.
I'm sorry you had
to come this far to

146
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:41,022
<i>track me down.</i>

147
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,090
No problem! It
really wasn't any
trouble at all.

148
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:51,623
{\an4}Well, it looks like my
war chest is full for
tomorrow! All right,
let's go out drinking!

149
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,459
{\an1}That was blatant fraud!

150
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:58,226
{\an5}I didn't lie. When
I busted open those
rocks on that mountain,
I did find gold inside.

151
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:00,226
{\an1}What?! That part
was true?!

152
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:01,892
Well, it was
only one shard.

153
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:04,461
{\an1}Agh! But you said
the mountain was
bountiful!

154
00:10:04,493 --> 00:10:06,927
Yeah, its name is
Ms. Bountiful!

155
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,928
{\an1}<i>Lady Tsunade!</i>
<i>How could you!</i>

156
00:10:09,395 --> 00:10:10,794
{\an1}Lady Tsunade?

157
00:10:18,229 --> 00:10:19,495
<i>That you, Amai?</i>

158
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,163
{\an1}<i>Lord Raikage...</i>

159
00:10:23,963 --> 00:10:27,764
{\an4}<i>Thanks to you distracting </i>
<i>the enemy, my side of the</i>
<i>mission went off without</i>
<i>a single hitch.</i>

160
00:10:29,398 --> 00:10:34,065
{\an5}We've obtained the
Ninja Art Scroll for
the Secret Jutsu unique
to the Cedar village.

161
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:37,000
However, we can't
return to our
village just yet.

162
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:37,866
(surprised gasp)

163
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,367
{\an1}<i>Karai!</i>

164
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:46,001
Yeah. Hey, Amai.

165
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:49,202
{\an1}You idiot! What
have you done
to yourself?!

166
00:10:50,135 --> 00:10:51,534
{\an1}What about Nigai?!

167
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,901
(angry growl)

168
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:54,403
{\an1}Nigai...

169
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:58,802
{\an1}Do not underestimate us!

170
00:11:01,903 --> 00:11:03,636
{\an1}Lightning Rat Tremor!

171
00:11:07,305 --> 00:11:09,038
(painful grunt)

172
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:10,872
{\an1}No, Nigai!

173
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:13,172
{\an1}Ahh! Just get away!

174
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:16,073
{\an1}Please listen!
Don't come any
closer!

175
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,673
(angry growl)

176
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:21,741
{\an1}Nigai!

177
00:11:22,274 --> 00:11:24,375
(painful scream)

178
00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:27,075
<i>It's this bug-</i>
<i>shaped lump!</i>

179
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:31,175
{\an5}Inside of it is a
mass of chakra with
properties similar
to a Paper Bomb.

180
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:35,809
{\an4}It siphons off the
chakra of its victim,
and when it exceeds a
certain volume, then

181
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:40,777
{\an4}it just explodes. You
mentioned that Nigai
used a jutsu right
before the end, right?

182
00:11:41,177 --> 00:11:46,479
{\an5}<i>Using a jutsu involves</i>
<i>releasing a large amount</i>
<i>of chakra, which is then</i>
<i>absorbed by this lump,</i>

183
00:11:46,511 --> 00:11:48,678
<i>causing it to grow</i>
<i>even further.</i>

184
00:11:48,711 --> 00:11:52,979
{\an4}You're saying it
exploded inside
him?! Can Karai
still be saved?

185
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:56,980
{\an1}I'm sorry, sir, but
my Medical Ninjutsu...

186
00:11:57,646 --> 00:11:59,546
<i>...just isn't</i>
<i>powerful enough.</i>

187
00:12:05,248 --> 00:12:06,515
{\an1}I see.

188
00:12:06,982 --> 00:12:08,682
<i>But there is someone</i>
<i>who can help!</i>

189
00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:09,548
{\an1}What?!

190
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:11,450
In fact, she's right
here in this town!

191
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:12,350
{\an1}<i>Who is it?!</i>

192
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:15,683
<i>Lady Tsunade of the</i>
<i>Hidden Leaf. She's</i>
<i>here!</i>

193
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:20,684
{\an4}No one else can match
Lady Tsunade's skills
as a Medical Ninja.
I'm sure that she's-

194
00:12:20,717 --> 00:12:24,085
How sappy! Look, I
know that your name
may mean "sweet"...

195
00:12:24,585 --> 00:12:27,419
But still, you
don't have to be
so syrupy, Amai!

196
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:29,453
{\an1}But Lady Tsunade
can help! I-

197
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:32,387
You shouldn't call a
shinobi from another
village "Lady"!

198
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,854
And besides, we Hidden
Cloud are not allies
with the Hidden Leaf.

199
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:41,155
There's no way she
would come to our
aid. Just forget it!

200
00:12:41,455 --> 00:12:42,355
{\an1}<i>She will!</i>

201
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:43,188
{\an3}Huh?

202
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:44,322
{\an1}<i>I'll make her!</i>

203
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:48,822
{\an1}I'll bring Tsunade here,
even if I have to drag
her! And then-

204
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:53,357
{\an8}No, don't! Lord
Raikage, please,
you mustn't rely
on a shinobi from

205
00:12:53,391 --> 00:12:55,391
{\an8}a rival village,
not for my sake!

206
00:12:55,924 --> 00:12:57,624
{\an1}I will make her
heal you!

207
00:12:57,657 --> 00:13:01,092
{\an7}And will you completely
abandon your pride as
the Raikage, too?

208
00:13:01,126 --> 00:13:04,393
I'll keep my pride!
And I'll save you,
as well!

209
00:13:04,892 --> 00:13:06,292
{\an1}Wow, Lord Raikage...

210
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:09,193
Now you sound even
more syrupy than
Amai does.

211
00:13:09,227 --> 00:13:13,794
{\an4}<i>What pride is there</i>
<i>in letting my men die?</i>
<i>How could I call myself</i>
<i>Raikage?!</i>

212
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:20,129
{\an4}Karai! You're not allowed
to die! You must stay by
my side until we can safely
return to our village!

213
00:13:20,695 --> 00:13:22,895
{\an1}Yes, sir, Lord Raikage.

214
00:13:23,229 --> 00:13:24,696
{\an1}<i>Let's go, Amai!</i>

215
00:13:25,463 --> 00:13:27,463
{\an1}You're taking me
to Tsunade!

216
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,031
(drunken sighs)

217
00:13:31,064 --> 00:13:33,764
Shizune! We're
all out of sake!

218
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:42,832
{\an5}<i>Hey! Wake up! Did you</i>
<i>hear me? We're all out</i>
<i>of sake! Now get up</i>
<i>and get me some more!</i>

219
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:47,833
{\an4}Ugh, damn it! What
a wimp, passing out
so soon! I'm just
getting started here!

220
00:13:48,267 --> 00:13:49,867
{\an1}More sake!

221
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:52,868
{\an1}Sister...

222
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:55,001
{\an1}<i>Once more...</i>

223
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:56,567
<i>Is this...</i>

224
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:58,369
{\an1}...what I think
it is?

225
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:03,536
{\an5}<i>Yep! It belonged to</i>
<i>our grandfather, the</i>
<i>necklace of the First</i>
<i>Hokage.</i>

226
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:04,437
(happy gasp)

227
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,303
{\an1}I love you!

228
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:11,371
{\an5}And I give my word, I'll
follow our grandfather's
footsteps and be just
like him!

229
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:14,406
{\an1}To be Hokage!
That's my dream!

230
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:17,772
{\an1}Just one more time...

231
00:14:28,673 --> 00:14:31,075
{\an7}<i>Just one more</i>
<i>glimpse...</i>

232
00:14:31,108 --> 00:14:33,375
{\an7}<i>...of their</i>
<i>smiling faces.</i>

233
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:41,177
{\an4}<i>I love this village</i>
<i>and the people in it</i>
<i>with all my heart. I</i>
<i>want to protect them.</i>

234
00:14:41,743 --> 00:14:44,710
{\an1}<i>It's been my dream</i>
<i>ever since my sister</i>
<i>died.</i>

235
00:14:45,077 --> 00:14:47,345
{\an1}<i>It's all that's</i>
<i>kept me going.</i>

236
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,711
{\an8}<i>So, him too.</i>
<i>We're the same.</i>

237
00:14:51,744 --> 00:14:54,012
{\an1}<i>That's why I have</i>
<i>to become Hokage...</i>

238
00:14:54,413 --> 00:14:56,945
{\an1}<i>...the person that</i>
<i>protects everyone.</i>

239
00:14:57,413 --> 00:15:00,480
{\an1}To be Hokage.
That's my dream

240
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:06,747
{\an1}<i>Take this, I want</i>
<i>you to have it.</i>

241
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:28,851
{\an4}<i>Playing at being</i>
<i>Hokage? Count me</i>
<i>out, it's a fool's</i>
<i>game.</i>

242
00:15:29,818 --> 00:15:32,353
{\an1}<i>I just wish they</i>
<i>were still alive...</i>

243
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:38,120
{\an1}<i>I loved them. The chance</i>
<i>to see them again, to</i>
<i>hold them in my arms!</i>

244
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:41,887
{\an1}Even just one more time.

245
00:15:42,687 --> 00:15:47,889
{\an4}<i>Lady Tsunade, one of the</i>
<i>Legendary Sannin of the</i>
<i>Village Hidden in the</i>
<i>Leaves! I've come here</i>

246
00:15:47,922 --> 00:15:49,256
{\an1}<i>to make a request!</i>

247
00:15:49,523 --> 00:15:52,222
{\an1}<i>I beseech you!</i>
<i>Please hear me out!</i>

248
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:56,323
{\an1}Who are you?
What do you want?

249
00:15:56,357 --> 00:16:00,624
{\an4}Ma'am, my name is
Amai, and I'm a
shinobi from the
Hidden Cloud Village!

250
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:05,359
{\an5}Please, Lady Tsunade!
Come with me and use
your world-renowned
Medical Ninjutsu skills

251
00:16:05,392 --> 00:16:07,092
<i>to save my injured</i>
<i>comrade!</i>

252
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:11,393
Wait, aren't you a
Cloud Medical Ninja?

253
00:16:11,427 --> 00:16:12,759
{\an1}<i>Yes, ma'am!</i>

254
00:16:12,793 --> 00:16:15,960
Well, if your comrade
is hurt, why don't you
just go heal him?

255
00:16:15,994 --> 00:16:18,227
{\an1}<i>THe situation's beyond</i>
<i>my abilities.</i>

256
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:19,194
Hmmm...

257
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:23,895
{\an1}I don't want to.

258
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:24,961
{\an1}But, please!

259
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:30,363
{\an4}The Hidden Cloud dares
to approach someone
from the Hidden Leaf
to ask a favor?

260
00:16:30,396 --> 00:16:33,397
<i>You tried to steal</i>
<i>the Hyuga's Byakugan</i>
<i>from us!</i>

261
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:36,930
{\an1}<i>But the villages</i>
<i>already settled</i>
<i>that disagreement!</i>

262
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,831
A typical answer from
the one who started it.

263
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:41,898
{\an1}<i>Please, let bygones</i>
<i>be bygones!</i>

264
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:43,665
{\an7}<i>Enough, Amai!</i>

265
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:53,467
{\an1}<i>I never actually expected</i>
<i>her to listen to this</i>
<i>proposal willingly!</i>

266
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,901
{\an1}Lady Tsunade, I present
the leader of the Hidden
Cloud...

267
00:16:57,234 --> 00:16:58,734
{\an1}<i>...Lord Raikage.</i>

268
00:17:01,802 --> 00:17:07,903
{\an5}Well, now! What a
surprise! So the big
shot himself waltzes in
here, acting all tough.

269
00:17:07,936 --> 00:17:11,371
If you refuse to come
and help us, then I
will force you to come.

270
00:17:11,637 --> 00:17:13,204
{\an1}That's interesting.

271
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,372
{\an1}Do you have any idea
just who you're
threatening?!

272
00:17:17,405 --> 00:17:19,439
<i>You're going to</i>
<i>regret this!</i>

273
00:17:22,273 --> 00:17:24,839
{\an1}I'll be waiting
for you outside.

274
00:17:50,877 --> 00:17:52,811
{\an1}Why, that heartless!

275
00:17:54,144 --> 00:18:00,645
{\an4}<i>Tsunade! You broke</i>
<i>your word to me! You</i>
<i>will pay dearly for</i>
<i>this! Come on, wake up!</i>

276
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,913
{\an7}<i>Get up and fight me!</i>

277
00:18:05,346 --> 00:18:07,481
Huh? And who are you?

278
00:18:07,514 --> 00:18:10,247
{\an1}He's Lord Raikage of
the Hidden Cloud.

279
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:11,448
(shocked gasp)

280
00:18:12,614 --> 00:18:14,382
(angry growl)

281
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:19,749
Ah-ha! Well, isn't
this a surprise!

282
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:21,349
You said that
yesterday!

283
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:27,150
{\an5}Now, now, don't be
angry! Hey, you know
what? Why don't we
make a little bet?

284
00:18:27,184 --> 00:18:28,484
{\an1}Make a bet?

285
00:18:28,517 --> 00:18:31,018
You said you'd force
me to come, right?

286
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:36,152
{\an7}Tell you what. We'll
arm wrestle, and if you
can defeat me, then I'll
gladly go with you.

287
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:44,886
{\an5}Oh, boy. This is not
good. What happened
while I was asleep,
anyway?!

288
00:18:45,253 --> 00:18:47,555
Ready...

289
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:49,620
Go!

290
00:18:49,654 --> 00:18:51,389
(strained grunt)

291
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:54,122
(strained grunt)

292
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,124
(angry growl)

293
00:19:09,758 --> 00:19:12,791
{\an8}<i>What?! She's</i>
<i>overpowering me?</i>

294
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:15,592
{\an7}<i>This... woman!</i>

295
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:18,659
{\an1}(frustrated growl)

296
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:23,461
{\an7}<i>No! I cannot lose!</i>
<i>If I do, Karai will-</i>

297
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:28,761
{\an7}<i>No matter what, I</i>
<i>am not going to</i>
<i>lose this bet!</i>

298
00:19:40,497 --> 00:19:41,498
(shocked gasp)

299
00:19:46,832 --> 00:19:50,631
{\an1}Lady Tsunade lost a
contest of strength?

300
00:19:50,665 --> 00:19:51,499
Not quite...

301
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,867
{\an7}<i>That trickster, he</i>
<i>purposely weakened his</i>
<i>hold for an instant to</i>
<i>create an space between</i>

302
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:04,068
{\an7}<i>my hand and his. And</i>
<i>then he seized that</i>
<i>moment to push down</i>
<i>swiftly against my hand.</i>

303
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,935
{\an7}<i>So he didn't actually</i>
<i>defeat me with strength.</i>

304
00:20:07,168 --> 00:20:09,002
{\an7}<i>He won with speed!</i>

305
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:12,602
Don't you dare say
I was a coward.

306
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:16,903
Relax, I won't. We
didn't say this was
a contest of strength.

307
00:20:16,937 --> 00:20:19,670
You just had to beat
me in arm wrestling,
and you did.

308
00:20:19,703 --> 00:20:23,671
{\an4}Wait, if we won, that
means you're going to
treat Karai, right?
He's this way!

309
00:20:23,704 --> 00:20:25,438
Hnnh! Let's go,
Shizune!

310
00:20:25,472 --> 00:20:27,039
Uh...Right!

311
00:20:30,972 --> 00:20:32,940
Incredible!

312
00:20:33,207 --> 00:20:37,874
{\an4}<i>Karai! We've brought</i>
<i>Lady Tsunade! She's</i>
<i>the best Medical Ninja</i>
<i>in the world!</i>

313
00:20:37,907 --> 00:20:39,374
You're gonna be
just fine!

314
00:20:48,443 --> 00:20:52,510
{\an5}You mentioned something
about stealing a Hidden
Jutsu from the Land
of Cedar.

315
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:56,544
{\an4}<i>Who would've imagined</i>
<i>that the Cedar Village</i>
<i>would have someone so</i>
<i>skilled.</i>

316
00:20:57,511 --> 00:21:00,512
<i>It wasn't a shinobi</i>
<i>from the Cedar Village.</i>

317
00:21:00,545 --> 00:21:00,911
(surprised gasp)

318
00:21:00,945 --> 00:21:02,078
{\an1}What's that?!

319
00:21:02,112 --> 00:21:05,779
{\an1}It was someone that
they hired from the
Nokizaru Troops.

320
00:21:05,812 --> 00:21:06,546
(shocked gasp)

321
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,313
{\an1}The Nokizaru Troops?

322
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:12,314
You're talking about the
shinobi who specialize
in hunting other shinobi?!

323
00:21:15,414 --> 00:21:18,482
I can't let this man's
treatment be compromised.

324
00:21:18,714 --> 00:21:20,647
So tell me everything
you know!

325
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,899
{\an1}<i>A simple surgery should</i>
<i>be able to remove the</i>
<i>Explosive Bugs.</i>

326
00:22:58,932 --> 00:23:01,501
<i>All right, Karai's</i>
<i>in your hands!</i>

327
00:23:01,534 --> 00:23:03,033
{\an1}<i>Shizune, take</i>
<i>care of it!</i>

328
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:05,534
<i>What?! You won't be</i>
<i>wielding the scalpel?!</i>

329
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:08,634
{\an1}<i>Look, don't worry!</i>
<i>She's a highly skilled</i>
<i>Medical Ninja!</i>

330
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:09,634
<i>But I thought</i>
<i>you were-</i>

331
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:12,302
{\an1}<i>Silence! Shizune</i>
<i>will be doing this!</i>

332
00:23:13,436 --> 00:23:17,768
{\an7}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "One work</i>
<i>Betting On."</i>

333
00:23:17,802 --> 00:23:21,537
{\an1}<i>You'll be sorry if</i>
<i>anything happens</i>
<i>to Karai!</i>
