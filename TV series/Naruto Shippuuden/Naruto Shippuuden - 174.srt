1
00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:18,107
{\an1}NAGATO: Yahiko died,
and from then on, I

2
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,143
{\an1}took over as the leader
of our organization.

3
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:30,826
Since that day,
countless other comrades

4
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,963
{\an1}have fought and died in battle.

5
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:34,799
So many others.

6
00:00:34,832 --> 00:00:38,438
{\an1}One by one, they kept dying.

7
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:45,215
{\an1}The peace-obsessed citizens
of your Land of Fire,

8
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:47,953
{\an1}they paid a small commission
to the Hidden Leaf,

9
00:00:47,986 --> 00:00:51,291
{\an1}adding to their war fund.

10
00:00:51,325 --> 00:00:53,928
{\an1}And the citizens of
the Land to Fire,

11
00:00:53,962 --> 00:00:59,503
{\an1}knowing full well the truth,
still falsely proclaimed peace.

12
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:02,241
{\an1}But the peace that you
large nations enjoy only

13
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:08,418
{\an1}exists because of the sacrifices
forced upon smaller nations.

14
00:01:08,452 --> 00:01:10,754
{\an1}What you all like to
call peace is only

15
00:01:10,787 --> 00:01:15,128
{\an1}won through violence against us.

16
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:17,798
{\an1}In order for some
to live peacefully,

17
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:20,837
{\an1}others must die in war.

18
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,540
{\an1}As long as humanity
still exists,

19
00:01:23,574 --> 00:01:26,412
then hatred will
also exist with it.

20
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:28,615
{\an1}There cannot be true peace.

21
00:01:28,648 --> 00:01:32,121
{\an1}Not in a world as
cursed as this one.

22
00:01:32,154 --> 00:01:35,726
{\an1}All that Jiraiya-sensei
said about peace

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,729
{\an1}is nothing more than
wishful thinking.

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,379
{\an1}I've told you my story,
just as you asked.

25
00:01:48,413 --> 00:01:49,947
{\an1}Now let's hear your response.

26
00:01:55,457 --> 00:01:58,394
[theme music]

27
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:51,101
{\an1}-I've told you my story,
just as you asked.

28
00:03:51,134 --> 00:03:52,670
{\an1}Now let's hear your response.

29
00:04:04,922 --> 00:04:08,094
{\an1}JIRAIYA: But I truly believe
that eventually, the day

30
00:04:08,127 --> 00:04:11,332
{\an1}will come when all people
will understand one another

31
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:12,401
{\an1}and live in harmony.

32
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:18,410
{\an1}NARUTO: You may be right.

33
00:04:18,443 --> 00:04:21,814
{\an1}Truth is, I think
the same way you do.

34
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,989
-I see.

35
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:30,795
{\an1}NARUTO: But even if
I understand you now,

36
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:35,035
{\an1}that doesn't change how I feel.

37
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:37,839
{\an1}There's no way that
I can forgive you.

38
00:04:37,873 --> 00:04:40,977
{\an1}I still hate you.

39
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:44,383
{\an1}-Then you want to
settle things with me.

40
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,987
-I do.

41
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,324
{\an1}But Pervy Sage believed
in me and wanted

42
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:51,927
{\an1}me to continue his quest.

43
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,667
{\an1}And for those reasons, I
choose to believe in him

44
00:04:55,701 --> 00:04:58,938
{\an1}and to follow what he taught me.

45
00:04:58,971 --> 00:05:00,174
So that's it.

46
00:05:00,207 --> 00:05:02,177
{\an1}That's my answer.

47
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,949
{\an1}That's why I'm not
gonna kill you guys.

48
00:05:09,455 --> 00:05:10,957
{\an1}-After everything
that's happened,

49
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,097
{\an1}you still believe in
Jiraiya-sensei's teachings?

50
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,666
Very well, then.

51
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,572
{\an1}You've given your answer.

52
00:05:20,605 --> 00:05:24,945
{\an1}And you expect us to wait until
you somehow magically transform

53
00:05:24,978 --> 00:05:28,651
{\an1}this world to a peaceful place?

54
00:05:28,685 --> 00:05:30,588
No, never!

55
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,826
{\an1}How can I believe in Jiraiya's
words after all of this?

56
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,964
{\an1}There will never be such
a thing as true peace!

57
00:05:36,997 --> 00:05:40,168
{\an1}Not as long as we're forced to
live in this accursed world.

58
00:05:40,202 --> 00:05:41,872
{\an1}Peace is impossible.

59
00:05:41,904 --> 00:05:42,439
Impossible!

60
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:48,849
{\an1}-Well then, I'm gonna
break that curse one day.

61
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:52,387
{\an1}If there's truly such a
thing as peace in this world,

62
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:55,827
{\an1}then somehow, I'll find it.

63
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,362
{\an1}I'll never stop looking.

64
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:06,175
{\an1}-You're-- But that's--

65
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:07,143
-Nagato.

66
00:06:07,177 --> 00:06:09,013
{\an1}What's the matter?

67
00:06:09,046 --> 00:06:10,515
-Those words.

68
00:06:10,549 --> 00:06:12,753
It can't be.

69
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:13,520
-That's right.

70
00:06:13,554 --> 00:06:15,289
You know them.

71
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:19,362
{\an1}All of those words are taken
right out of this book.

72
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:23,335
{\an1}The very first novel that
Pervy Sage ever wrote.

73
00:06:23,368 --> 00:06:25,405
{\an1}He was seriously trying
to change the world

74
00:06:25,438 --> 00:06:26,874
{\an1}with his message.

75
00:06:26,907 --> 00:06:30,680
{\an1}And in the back of it,
he wrote about a student

76
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:32,349
{\an1}who helped provide
him with inspiration.

77
00:06:35,053 --> 00:06:36,188
{\an1}It was you, Nagato.

78
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:43,900
-But--

79
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:03,764
-Hm?

80
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:05,767
-Sensei.

81
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,802
{\an1}-Yeah, what's up?

82
00:07:06,836 --> 00:07:09,306
{\an1}-Do you have a minute?

83
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:10,708
-Sure.

84
00:07:10,742 --> 00:07:13,111
{\an1}I was trying to do
some work on my book,

85
00:07:13,144 --> 00:07:17,753
{\an1}but I've come down with a
bad case of writer's block.

86
00:07:17,786 --> 00:07:19,756
{\an1}Yeah, I figured I'd
take a little break

87
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:20,623
{\an1}and get a bit to eat.

88
00:07:28,702 --> 00:07:30,138
Mm.

89
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:31,540
{\an1}So, what's going on?

90
00:07:36,682 --> 00:07:38,585
{\an1}YOUNG NAGATO: Well,
I've been thinking

91
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:41,388
about all the
hatred in the world.

92
00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:43,491
{\an1}Do you remember when
we talked about it?

93
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:45,127
-Sure I do.

94
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:47,531
{\an1}And what ideas have you
come up with so far?

95
00:07:50,402 --> 00:07:52,772
-Real peace.

96
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,946
{\an1}I still haven't figured
out how to attain that yet.

97
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:04,024
{\an1}But I vow that I'm going to
break that curse one day.

98
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:06,794
{\an1}If there's truly such a
thing as peace in this world,

99
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:10,265
{\an1}then somehow, I'll find it.

100
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:13,504
{\an1}But more important
than how to achieve it

101
00:08:13,537 --> 00:08:17,011
{\an1}is the power to believe
that it will happen.

102
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:20,215
{\an1}-You know, that is
an excellent thought.

103
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:22,018
{\an1}You may very well be right.

104
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,258
A-ha!

105
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,228
-What is it?

106
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:31,164
-Well, thanks to
you, I think I'm

107
00:08:31,197 --> 00:08:33,903
{\an1}going to be able to
write a brilliant novel.

108
00:08:33,936 --> 00:08:36,372
{\an1}-Now, first things first.

109
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:38,943
{\an1}I've got to come up with a
name for the main character.

110
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,913
{\an1}The hero of the story.

111
00:08:40,946 --> 00:08:41,414
Hm?

112
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:53,066
{\an1}Now I can return home
without any worries.

113
00:08:56,104 --> 00:08:59,341
{\an1}The three of you are all on
your own from here on out.

114
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:04,683
{\an1}These past three years,
you've done a great job.

115
00:09:04,717 --> 00:09:08,990
{\an1}Hey, don't cry, Yahiko, or
people will call you a coward.

116
00:09:09,024 --> 00:09:11,627
{\an1}Konan, You're gonna grow
up to be a real beauty.

117
00:09:11,661 --> 00:09:12,595
I know it.

118
00:09:12,628 --> 00:09:14,199
{\an1}I hope we meet again someday.

119
00:09:23,244 --> 00:09:29,087
{\an1}This land is destitute, so
there will be hard times ahead.

120
00:09:29,122 --> 00:09:31,759
{\an1}But from this point
forward, you three

121
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:33,327
can change the
fate of this land.

122
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,408
Nagato.

123
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:46,447
{\an1}You three have really grown up.

124
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,649
{\an1}Wouldn't you agree?

125
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,327
{\an1}-Thank you, Sensei.

126
00:10:04,308 --> 00:10:06,645
{\an1}-Come on now, stop
crying, Yahiko.

127
00:10:06,678 --> 00:10:09,883
{\an1}I'm sure we'll see
him again someday.

128
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:10,752
-I miss Sensei.

129
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:24,806
-Hm?

130
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,308
-Huh?

131
00:10:32,017 --> 00:10:34,754
{\an1}-You ready to give up yet?

132
00:10:34,788 --> 00:10:37,159
{\an1}I'm starting to tire
of our game of tag.

133
00:10:47,107 --> 00:10:48,610
A smoke bomb.

[clanking]

135
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,029
-Just give up.

136
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:03,132
{\an1}-Can I say one thing?

137
00:11:03,165 --> 00:11:06,137
{\an1}-I don't wanna hear it.

138
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,741
{\an1}Just give up now.

139
00:11:08,774 --> 00:11:13,681
{\an1}You give up on trying
to make me give up.

140
00:11:18,255 --> 00:11:21,127
{\an1}-Even if you do take me
down, another assassin

141
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,261
{\an1}will attack the village.

142
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,406
{\an1}As long as we're cursed to
live in this world of shinobi,

143
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,175
{\an1}then there cannot be any peace.

144
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:31,676
Ever.

145
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:36,417
-Well.

146
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:39,355
{\an1}I'm going to break
that curse one day.

147
00:11:39,388 --> 00:11:41,258
If there is such
a thing as peace,

148
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:44,162
then somehow I'm
going to find it.

149
00:11:44,195 --> 00:11:48,001
{\an1}And I'll never stop looking.

150
00:11:48,034 --> 00:11:51,673
{\an1}-Who-- Who are you?

151
00:11:51,707 --> 00:11:55,779
{\an1}-My name is-- My name is--

152
00:12:01,422 --> 00:12:03,891
{\an1}-Perhaps, Nagato,
you're actually

153
00:12:03,926 --> 00:12:07,298
{\an1}the reincarnation of the
Sage of the Six Paths.

154
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:08,799
{\an1}I have the feeling
that your eyes

155
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:12,038
may realize the
hopes of that sage.

156
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:16,177
{\an1}Another sage once
gave me this prophecy.

157
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:18,080
He declared that
one of my students

158
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:20,818
{\an1}would bring about a great change
to the world of the shinobi,

159
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:25,058
{\an1}and that I would be the one
to guide that revolutionary.

160
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:30,333
{\an1}I believe that you are
that revolutionary.

161
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:34,305
{\an1}And also, I believe
in you, Nagato.

162
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:54,870
{\an1}-You are the savior
of this world.

163
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:57,909
{\an1}I know you can do it.

164
00:12:57,942 --> 00:13:01,848
{\an1}-More important is the power
to believe that it will happen.

165
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,256
{\an1}JIRAIYA: Amazing, Yahiko.

166
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,057
Nice catch.

00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:09,827
I'm impressed.

-I know, right?

169
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:13,533
-Tastes great,
doesn't it, Nagato?

170
00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:15,168
{\an1}-Yeah, it sure does.

171
00:13:15,202 --> 00:13:17,071
{\an1}-It looks delicious, dear.

172
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:19,342
{\an1}-Now eat up, Nagato!

173
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:19,842
-OK.

174
00:13:23,814 --> 00:13:26,719
{\an1}-Instead of trying to rule
the world through pain,

175
00:13:26,752 --> 00:13:29,257
{\an1}I wish you'd move past
it and use your power

176
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,025
to create peace
in a positive way.

177
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:37,336
{\an1}-And for those reasons, I
choose to believe in him

178
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:39,139
{\an1}and to follow what he taught me.

179
00:13:43,912 --> 00:13:46,016
The name of the
hero in this novel.

His name is--

{\an1}-I'm going to break
that curse one day.

{\an1}If there is such a thing
as peace, then somehow,

183
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:04,411
{\an1}I'm going to find it, and
I'll never stop looking.

{\an1}My name is a precious
heirloom that

{\an1}has been handed down
to me by my master.

192
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:40,533
There's no way
that I'm just gonna

193
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:42,769
{\an1}give up and dishonor
my master's gift.

194
00:14:45,874 --> 00:14:50,748
{\an1}I will become Hokage, and I will
bring peace to the Hidden Rain.

00:14:50,781 --> 00:14:52,184
I will!

{\an1}NAGATO: Why should I?

198
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:02,500
{\an1}How can you stand
there and tell me

199
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:06,072
{\an1}that you will never
change your mind?

200
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:09,010
{\an1}Do you really think you will
never stray from that ideal,

201
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:11,914
{\an1}no matter how much
pain befalls you?

202
00:15:11,948 --> 00:15:15,353
{\an1}You think you will always
believe in yourself?

203
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:17,857
{\an1}Can you guarantee it?

204
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,193
{\an1}How can you possibly
have that much faith

205
00:15:20,227 --> 00:15:23,600
{\an1}that life won't change you?

206
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:25,201
{\an1}-I've felt pain too.

207
00:15:25,235 --> 00:15:29,207
{\an1}You're not the only one.

208
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:32,681
[music playing]

209
00:17:02,217 --> 00:17:08,627
{\an1}-There's still pain buried
deep down inside of me.

210
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:11,699
{\an1}And there's no telling
what kind of pain

211
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:13,669
{\an1}I may face down the road.

212
00:17:18,576 --> 00:17:23,149
{\an1}But if I stop believing just
because things get difficult,

213
00:17:23,182 --> 00:17:26,655
{\an1}if the hero in this book
were to change who he is,

214
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:31,162
{\an1}then it would become a
whole different story.

215
00:17:31,195 --> 00:17:34,969
{\an1}It sure wouldn't be the
story our master left behind.

216
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:36,169
{\an1}And it would be about Naruto.

217
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:43,915
{\an1}The thing is, I can't write
books like our master did.

218
00:17:43,948 --> 00:17:47,989
{\an1}And so any sequel has to
come from the life I life.

219
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:51,995
{\an1}That's why, no matter how
much pain my own path brings,

220
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:54,498
{\an1}I'll keep walking.

221
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,535
{\an1}because that's who Naruto is!

222
00:18:01,308 --> 00:18:04,680
{\an1}-If the hero ever changes,
it'll be a different story.

223
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:14,696
{\an1}We are sibling students,
sharing the same sensei.

224
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:19,269
{\an1}We ought to be able to
understand each other.

225

{\an1}When I said that to you
earlier, I meant it as a joke.

226
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,850
{\an1}You really are a curious fellow.

227
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:33,058
{\an1}You remind me of myself
when I was much younger.

-Nagato.

229
00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:38,666
{\an1}-I wasn't able to continue
believing in Jiraiya's ideas.

230
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,403
Nor could I keep
believing in myself.

vision of a future that

{\an1}shows a different path
from the one I've walked.

00:18:58,563 --> 00:19:02,970
{\an1}I think I shall believe in
you after all, Naruto Uzumaki.

234
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:10,615
{\an1}I'll use Gedo art
of Rinne Rebirth.

-No, Konan.

It's all right.

{\an1}Nagato will-- He's willing to
go that far for this child.

00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:51,637
{\an1}-It's as my vision
foretold, although I never

257
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,473
thought two of
Jiraiya's students

258
00:20:53,506 --> 00:20:55,509
would be the
children of prophecy,

would become the ones to bring

to the ninja world.

261
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:08,095
{\an1}Perhaps it's possible that in
that moment, when Jiraiya chose

262
00:21:08,129 --> 00:21:11,768
{\an1}not to give up, all
this became preordained.

{\an1}Who would have thought
that that book would really

00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,380

changing the world?
