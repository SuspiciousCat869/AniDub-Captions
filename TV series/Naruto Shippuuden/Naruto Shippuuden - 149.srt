Sir Utakata, I--

are Lady Hotaru,

But yes.

Then you really
are Sir Shiranami.

Where is Naruto?

-Huh?

45
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:51,571
{\an1}-He asked me to take care of
everything, and then he left.

-Oh, yes, I see.

00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,740

00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:58,241
{\an1}-Naruto told me you
wanted to restore

49
00:03:58,274 --> 00:04:00,409
{\an1}the clan to its former glory.

50
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:01,175
-Huh?

00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:02,176
Oh-- yes.

00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,144
-Well, if you're
serious about it,

53
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,678
{\an1}then I really hope
that you'll listen

00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,580
{\an1}to what I have to
say on the subject.

-Sir Shiranami.

56
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:17,685
-I'm told Tonbei
is alive and well,

57
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:19,985
{\an1}and that he plans to
destroy the forbidden jutsu

00:04:20,018 --> 00:04:21,820
{\an1}with the diremption jutsu.

{\an1}-You know Tonbei too?

60
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:27,390
{\an1}-We trained together for
a time, but I must say,

61
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:30,592
{\an1}I'm very opposed to what
Tonbei intends to do.

62
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,024
-Why?

63
00:04:32,058 --> 00:04:36,228
{\an1}Long ago, my father Uneri was
ordered by Lord En no Gyoja

64
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:38,629
{\an1}to guard the forbidden jutsu.

65
00:04:38,662 --> 00:04:40,463
My father was a
hero who protected

66
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:42,564
the honor of the
Tsuchigumo clan,

67
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:45,666
{\an1}and also the forbidden jutsu.

68
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,635
{\an1}That is, until someone who
wanted the jutsu killed him.

69
00:04:53,103 --> 00:04:54,872
{\an1}My father's death
prompted Lord En

70
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:58,172
{\an1}no Gyoja to move the forbidden
jutsu to the fort on Mount

71
00:04:58,205 --> 00:05:01,708
{\an1}Katsuragi and to send me away.

72
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:03,975
{\an1}I promised myself
that one day, I

73
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:06,544
{\an1}would return to the village
for the sake of the Tsuchigumo

74
00:05:06,577 --> 00:05:08,712
clan.

75
00:05:08,745 --> 00:05:11,279
{\an1}-I didn't realize.

76
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:12,614
-Lady.

77
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:15,749
{\an1}My father died, and I was
forced to flee from my homeland.

78
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:19,016
{\an1}And all because we were
the only two survivors who

79
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:22,519
{\an1}knew how to wield
the forbidden jutsu.

80
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:24,986
{\an1}-(VOICEOVER) He went
through the same anguish.

81
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:28,221
{\an1}-Now I'm back, and I've
become even stronger.

82
00:05:28,255 --> 00:05:30,456
{\an1}Together, we can revive
the forbidden jutsu

83
00:05:30,489 --> 00:05:33,591
{\an1}and restore our clan.

84
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,058
{\an1}There's no need to destroy it.

85
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:37,993
{\an1}The restoration of
the Tsuchigumo clan

86
00:05:38,026 --> 00:05:40,295
{\an1}is my fervent wish, too.

87
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:46,598
{\an1}Let us fulfill the dreams of
my father and Lord En no Gyoja.

88
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:48,866
-But--

89
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,001
{\an1}-On the far side of the
mountain is my secret hideaway.

90
00:05:53,034 --> 00:05:53,769
Will you come?

91
00:05:58,738 --> 00:05:59,205
-Yes.

92
00:05:59,238 --> 00:06:01,038
I'll come.

00:06:01,072 --> 00:06:03,007
{\an1}-Lady Hotaru is gone?

94
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,407
{\an1}-Yes, I'm certain she is.

95
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:07,843
{\an1}I searched all around
the entire fort.

96
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:09,143
-She was here.

97
00:06:09,177 --> 00:06:11,511
{\an1}I gave her Naruto's message
that he'd found Shiranami.

98
00:06:14,245 --> 00:06:16,548
{\an1}-(VOICEOVER) Could it be
that she decided to go after

99
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:18,115
Utakata?

100
00:06:18,148 --> 00:06:19,081
-Right.

101
00:06:19,115 --> 00:06:20,949
{\an1}We'll stop preparing
for the ritual.

102
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:24,185
{\an1}Finding Hotaru is
now our top priority.

{\an1}Psi, go send out as many mice
as you can to search for her.

-Huh?

110
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:38,625
Oh, yes.

111
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:41,160
{\an1}I want to let him
know that I'm OK.

112
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:45,830
{\an1}(VOICEOVER) Sir Utakata deserves
at least a short note, too.

{\an1}I'm ready now, Sir Shiranami.

116

{\an1}-You're making this difficult.

117
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,038
-Huh?

118

-Now go.

{\an1}-What-- what's wrong?

120
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:09,209
{\an1}-Do you think you can
do whatever you want?

121
00:07:13,878 --> 00:07:16,145
{\an1}-(VOICEOVER) I thought
I'd come to terms with it.

122
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:20,147
{\an1}So why am I thinking about
my master so much now?

123
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,882
-Huh?

124
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:23,516
What is that?

127
00:07:43,727 --> 00:07:44,494
From Hotaru.

{\an1}-(VOICEOVER) To Utakata.

129
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:50,730
{\an1}I'm going to work
together with Shiranami

130
00:07:50,764 --> 00:07:54,465
{\an1}to restore the Tsuchigumo
clan to greatness.

131
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:57,734
Thank you for
everything you've done.

{\an1}Your student, Hotaru.

-Hotaru.

135
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:10,007
-(VOICEOVER) So,
she found Shiranami.

136
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,275
{\an1}I suppose that means
I'm finally free of her.

{\an1}Do you have Shiranami?

140
00:08:24,983 --> 00:08:25,449
Augh!

141
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,417
{\an1}-What a simpleton.

142
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:32,419
{\an1}He doesn't even know that
Shiranami is our boss.

{\an1}-You see, if we let you
go back to the girl who

144
00:08:34,621 --> 00:08:37,021
{\an1}has the forbidden jutsu,
then all of our plans

145
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:38,089
will be ruined.

146
00:08:38,122 --> 00:08:40,690
{\an1}-Hey, just keep your
trap shut, would you?

147
00:08:40,724 --> 00:08:41,323
-Heh.

148
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:42,892
{\an1}No need to worry.

149
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:44,692

of whoever's trapped inside it.

{\an1}-Multi Mugen Hoyo.

161
00:09:13,707 --> 00:09:18,410
[screaming]

162
00:09:18,443 --> 00:09:19,477
[laughter]

163
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,212
{\an1}-Let's see you free
yourself from that.

164
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:24,280
-What?

165
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,781
-Nice try.

166
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:29,249
{\an1}But to me, this is nothing.

167
00:09:29,283 --> 00:09:30,249
-Again.

168
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:32,651
[grunts]

169
00:09:32,684 --> 00:09:36,020
[screaming]

170
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:43,823
{\an1}-How could he still move
after losing so much chakra?

171
00:09:43,857 --> 00:09:45,624
{\an1}-Look, you can be
impressed later.

172
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:48,960
{\an1}Let's just get this over with.

173
00:09:48,993 --> 00:09:51,060
Augh!

174
00:09:51,093 --> 00:09:53,528
-What the hell?

175
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:54,030
Ahhh!

176
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:58,731
-You're back.

177
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:05,201
{\an1}-I couldn't help but overhear
what you were saying.

178
00:10:05,235 --> 00:10:09,038
{\an1}So, Shiranami is actually the
one who leads the bandits?

179
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,704
{\an1}Tell me where you took her.

180
00:10:10,738 --> 00:10:11,405
Where's Hotaru?

181
00:10:17,274 --> 00:10:17,942
-Oh!

182
00:10:17,975 --> 00:10:19,142
{\an1}What's with this guy?

183
00:10:19,175 --> 00:10:21,143
{\an1}-This is bad, Akaboshi.

184
00:10:21,176 --> 00:10:22,611
{\an1}-Yeah, you're right.

185
00:10:22,644 --> 00:10:24,478
{\an1}The boss should be in
the village by now.

186
00:10:24,512 --> 00:10:25,913
It's time for us
to get there, too.

187
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:36,985
-Where are we?

188
00:10:37,018 --> 00:10:39,420
{\an1}This is my clan's hideout.

189
00:10:39,453 --> 00:10:42,220
-So I see you're
awake, Lady Hotaru.

190
00:10:42,254 --> 00:10:43,155
-Huh?

191
00:10:43,188 --> 00:10:43,655
Shiranami?

192
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:47,757
{\an1}-Everyone, come out.

193
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:51,626
{\an1}Lady Hotaru has come back home.

194
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:53,493
[gasp]

195
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,028
-Those people.

196
00:10:55,062 --> 00:10:56,495
{\an1}What's wrong with them?

197
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:58,363
What happened to
all the villagers?

198
00:10:58,396 --> 00:10:59,763
{\an1}-Oh, it's nothing.

199
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:02,632
{\an1}I simply used a jutsu to make
them all obedient, that's all.

200
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:03,632
-What?

201
00:11:03,665 --> 00:11:05,166
{\an1}-Well, I didn't have
a choice, did I?

202
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:07,367
{\an1}Not if I wanted to possess
the forbidden jutsu

203
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,703
{\an1}I've wanted for so long.

204
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,437
-Sir Shiranami.

205
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,204
{\an1}Did you lie to me?

206
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:14,805
{\an1}-I did no such thing.

207
00:11:14,838 --> 00:11:16,772
{\an1}What I said before was true.

208
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:18,808
{\an1}Although I didn't
tell you one thing--

209
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:21,275
{\an1}that the reason my father
died protecting the jutsu

210
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:22,743
{\an1}is that I killed him.

211
00:11:22,776 --> 00:11:23,810
[gasp]

212
00:11:23,843 --> 00:11:25,410
-Yes, I tried to
wrest it from him,

213
00:11:25,444 --> 00:11:28,813
{\an1}but when he refused to give
it up, I struck him down.

214
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:31,146
Lady Hotaru--

215
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,581
[shout]

216
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:34,016
-It's useless.

217
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:37,516
{\an1}You're already under
control of my jutsu.

218
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,519
{\an1}[laughter] At last, it's mine.

219
00:11:41,553 --> 00:11:44,187
{\an1}Now the forbidden jutsu is
finally within my grasp.

220
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:50,457
-Nothing.

221
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,758
{\an1}It's just an old branch.

222
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,860
{\an1}Instead of tracking
them in the dirt,

223
00:11:54,893 --> 00:11:56,326
wouldn't it be a
whole lot easier

224
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,427
{\an1}if I just used my Shadow Clones?

225
00:11:58,461 --> 00:11:59,962
-And destroy any
trace that might

226
00:11:59,996 --> 00:12:03,064
{\an1}remain of Hotaru and
the path that she took?

227
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,498
-Heh.

228
00:12:04,531 --> 00:12:06,299
{\an1}-(VOICEOVER) These footprints.

229
00:12:06,332 --> 00:12:08,734
{\an1}Whoever left these was
carrying someone else.

230
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:11,201
I'm sure of it.

231
00:12:11,234 --> 00:12:11,969
-This way.

232
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:12,702
-Really?

233
00:12:12,736 --> 00:12:13,970
{\an1}Are you positive?

234
00:12:14,004 --> 00:12:16,838
{\an1}-Every search starts
with clues left behind.

235
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:19,406
{\an1}That's one of the
basic ninja rules.

236
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,273
{\an1}For people who boast
about their masters,

237
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,708
{\an1}neither you nor Hotaru got
very good training from them,

238
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:24,241
did you?

239
00:12:24,274 --> 00:12:25,342
-What?

240
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:26,043
No!

241
00:12:26,076 --> 00:12:27,343
{\an1}That isn't true at all!

242
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:33,780
{\an1}-It's ridiculous.

243
00:12:33,813 --> 00:12:36,214
{\an1}This is what happens when you
obsess over something stupid,

244
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:37,448
like masters.

245
00:12:37,482 --> 00:12:38,249
-Hey.

246
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:39,416
Hold on.

247
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:40,884
Wait for me.

248
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:43,919
{\an1}There's nothing stupid about it.

249
00:12:43,953 --> 00:12:46,820
{\an1}I learned all kinds of cool
things from Pervy Sage.

250
00:12:46,854 --> 00:12:49,922
{\an1}Taijutsu, ninjutsu, that
goes without saying.

251
00:12:49,956 --> 00:12:51,857
{\an1}And some other awesome jutsu.

252
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,524
{\an1}But he wasn't just
a strict taskmaster.

253
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:55,925
{\an1}He taught the most
important thing

254
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:58,926
{\an1}for a ninja-- having the
guts to never give up.

255
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:04,396
See?

256
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:06,831
{\an1}What my master taught
me was priceless.

257
00:13:06,865 --> 00:13:08,431
{\an1}It wasn't stupid at all.

258
00:13:08,464 --> 00:13:12,467
You had a master
too, didn't you?

259
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:13,968
{\an1}-(VOICEOVER) YES.

260
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:18,138
{\an1}And I have too many
memories of him.

261
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,638
{\an1}-Mission accomplished.

262
00:13:20,672 --> 00:13:24,473
{\an1}A good ninja must complete
his mission swiftly.

263
00:13:24,507 --> 00:13:26,108
Correct, master?

264
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:27,942
-You're a fool.

265
00:13:27,976 --> 00:13:29,043
-Wha--?

266
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:30,543
{\an1}-The mission that
you were given was

267
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,112
{\an1}to track and locate
the stolen scroll.

268
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,312
{\an1}But you were never
instructed to retrieve it.

269
00:13:36,346 --> 00:13:37,914
{\an1}Your life is precious.

270
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:39,214
{\an1}You must never waste it.

271
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:40,749
{\an1}Do you understand?

272
00:13:40,783 --> 00:13:44,250
{\an1}A ninja never runs away from
a battle that must be fought.

273
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:46,952
However, at the
same time, he never

274
00:13:46,986 --> 00:13:48,386
{\an1}fights an unnecessary battle.

275
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:54,423
-But still.

276
00:13:54,456 --> 00:13:58,391
{\an1}Having said that, I'm very
glad that you are all right.

277
00:13:58,425 --> 00:14:00,559
-Thanks, Master.

278
00:14:00,592 --> 00:14:03,061
-(VOICEOVER) He
did care about me.

279
00:14:03,094 --> 00:14:04,327
Or so I thought.

280
00:14:09,364 --> 00:14:11,331
-My power.

281
00:14:11,365 --> 00:14:14,834
{\an1}It's too great for
you to be its vessel.

282
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:15,667
-Please.

283
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:17,535
Stop!

284
00:14:17,568 --> 00:14:19,836
[cries]

285
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:23,371
{\an1}-(VOICEOVER) It wasn't
me he cared about.

286
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,238
{\an1}Only the power inside me.

287
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:33,376
{\an1}He saw me merely as its vessel.

288
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:35,945
But what if what
Tsurugi says is true?

289
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,814
-Hey.

290
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:42,148
This it?

291
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:42,748
-It is.

292
00:14:49,285 --> 00:14:50,251
-Wait a minute.

293
00:14:50,285 --> 00:14:52,252
{\an1}This is the Tsuchigumo
clan's village.

294
00:14:52,286 --> 00:14:54,521
-Wait, really?

295
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:56,055
{\an1}But all the tracks
that we followed

296
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:57,856
{\an1}led right to this place.

297
00:14:57,889 --> 00:14:59,724
{\an1}What happened here?

298
00:14:59,757 --> 00:15:01,524
{\an1}-Lady Hotaru was attacked.

299
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:03,792
The bandits were
waiting for her.

300
00:15:03,826 --> 00:15:09,629
{\an1}Also-- all the villagers here
didn't think too highly of her,

301
00:15:09,663 --> 00:15:10,863
either.

302
00:15:10,896 --> 00:15:12,864
{\an1}-I'd say the fact that
nobody in this village

303
00:15:12,897 --> 00:15:16,466
{\an1}wanted the forbidden jutsu
nearby them is pretty obvious.

304
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,700
-Yeah.

305
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:20,868
{\an1}-And if Hotaru was attacked
right in this village,

306
00:15:20,902 --> 00:15:23,903
{\an1}then the bandits and the
village are connected.

307
00:15:23,937 --> 00:15:26,638
{\an1}Or the village turned
a blind eye to them.

308
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:30,040
{\an1}But, either way, the
bandits are using this place

309
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:30,807
{\an1}as their hideout.

310
00:15:30,841 --> 00:15:31,974
-Mmm.

311
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:35,342
{\an1}-Also, the footprints
that we found-- they just

312
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,111
{\an1}don't seem natural.

313
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:41,445
{\an1}It could be, he's overconfident
now that he has the jutsu.

314
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:44,981
{\an1}But it could also be that he's
just planning to ambush us.

315
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:46,749
-So it's a trap?

316
00:15:46,782 --> 00:15:47,983
-I'm not sure.

317
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:51,351
{\an1}But still, tracking
