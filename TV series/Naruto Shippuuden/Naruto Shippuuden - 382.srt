1
00:00:21,184 --> 00:00:22,119
[gasp]

2
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:24,221
{\an1}W-What is that?!

3
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:32,596
Katsuyu!

4
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:33,562
Yes, ma'am!

5
00:00:33,596 --> 00:00:35,364
{\an1}I shall explain everything!

6
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:00,953
Are you all
right now, Sakura?

7
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:02,588
Yeah...

8
00:01:02,622 --> 00:01:04,490
{\an1}The Five Kage will be
here shortly- Shikamaru!

9
00:01:04,524 --> 00:01:05,957
Shikamaru!

10
00:01:20,604 --> 00:01:21,539
Hey!

11
00:01:21,572 --> 00:01:23,007
{\an1}Hey, he looks really bad!

12
00:01:26,142 --> 00:01:27,243
Katsuyu!

13
00:01:27,277 --> 00:01:29,779
{\an1}Let's begin Distance
Healing right away!

14
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,381
{\an1}That's not possible.

15
00:01:31,414 --> 00:01:33,015
But why?!

16
00:01:33,048 --> 00:01:35,951
{\an1}Even my mini fragments that
are attached to everyone

17
00:01:35,984 --> 00:01:37,587
{\an1}have been drained.

18
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,222
{\an1}They have lost their
chakra and died as well.

19
00:01:40,255 --> 00:01:42,257
But that's--

20
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,560
{\an1}In short, everyone's
in the same

21
00:01:44,593 --> 00:01:46,394
{\an1}state as my fragments.

22
00:01:51,265 --> 00:01:52,899
I'm sorry, Dad.

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,003
{\an1}It looks like I'm gonna
be right on your heels.

24
00:01:58,004 --> 00:01:59,139
Shikamaru!

25
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,374
Sorry, Mom.

26
00:02:02,342 --> 00:02:03,410
Shikamaru!

27
00:02:03,443 --> 00:02:04,644
Sakura!

28
00:02:06,312 --> 00:02:09,747
{\an1}If we're gonna die anyway,
let's go down fighting to

29
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:13,251
the very best of
our abilities.

30
00:02:14,018 --> 00:02:15,853
{\an1}However, at this rate.

31
00:02:16,154 --> 00:02:17,622
[groan]

32
00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:27,097
{\an1}We'll all die before
we even get to fight!

33
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,566
{\an1}Shinobi are all done for.

34
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:24,168
There's no need
to keep going.

35
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:28,138
If you don't
resist, I won't kill you.

36
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:39,081
{\an1}And if you keep standing
against us, you'll continue

37
00:04:39,114 --> 00:04:42,552
to lose your
friends one by one.

38
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:45,287
{\an1}This shall become a
world where no one who

39
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,289
{\an1}acknowledges you will exist.

40
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:53,394
{\an1}Regret will fill you unless
you stop and do nothing.

41
00:04:56,996 --> 00:05:00,266
{\an1}If we just do nothing
then we'll all be saved?

42
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:01,836
That's right.

43
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,838
No more fearing
death or enduring pain.

44
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,272
{\an1}You'll be entering a dream.

45
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:16,682
Don't give up!

46
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,384
{\an1}If you're put under
genjutsu, you're

47
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:20,753
as good as dead.

48
00:05:24,622 --> 00:05:28,024
{\an1}This enormous tree is very
closely connected to Obito

49
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:31,528
{\an1}like an extra limb
for extracting chakra.

50
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:33,996
{\an1}We mustn't be careless.

51
00:05:34,297 --> 00:05:36,098
{\an1}Such words of weakness.

52
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,170
How unlike you,
Sarutobi Sensei.

53
00:05:42,138 --> 00:05:43,572
Orochimaru...

54
00:05:43,606 --> 00:05:45,073
{\an1}You're quite late!

55
00:05:45,741 --> 00:05:47,342
{\an1}And the Five Kage?

56
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,511
{\an1}I saw to their healing.

57
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,114
{\an1}If they don't chicken
out, they should be coming.

58
00:05:53,914 --> 00:05:56,885
You're still as
sarcastic as ever, I see.

59
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,554
{\an1}Sorry I'm late, Jugo!

60
00:06:00,587 --> 00:06:01,855
Sasuke!

61
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:03,257
You've come...

62
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:10,830
{\an1}Oh, man that tree
really is giant, seeing

63
00:06:10,863 --> 00:06:12,465
{\an1}it up close like this.

64
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,567
{\an1}I wonder how long
it's gonna take to cut

65
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,334
{\an1}that huge thing down.

66
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:18,637
Ugh, who cares
about that, Suigetsu?!

67
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,907
{\an1}What's important is to go
jump Sasuke and hug him and

68
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:23,608
{\an1}lick him all over, damn it!

69
00:06:25,877 --> 00:06:28,312
{\an1}Is to heal the Allied
Forces shinobi, right?

70
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:29,447
Yeah!

71
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,614
Yeah, I know!

72
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:31,615
Shut your trap!

73
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:32,982
{\an1}I know already, damn it!

74
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,828
He seems to be
in a foul mood.

75
00:06:47,296 --> 00:06:48,797
What's going on?

76
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:51,999
{\an1}When that bud blooms,
the Infinite Tsukuyomi

77
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:53,367
{\an1}will be complete.

78
00:06:53,702 --> 00:06:55,336
{\an1}That's what Madara said.

79
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,739
{\an1}And yet, after depleting the
chakra of this many shinobi

80
00:06:58,773 --> 00:07:01,975
the bud shows no
signs of blooming.

81
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:10,216
So when's it
going to bloom, then?

82
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:16,589
{\an1}Eight Tails' and Nine Tails'
Jinchuriki are still alive.

83
00:07:16,622 --> 00:07:17,957
Do you get it?

84
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:22,627
{\an1}So the chakra of Eight Tails
and Nine Tails are both

85
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,432
{\an1}essential for it to bloom
and to complete the jutsu.

86
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:35,472
{\an1}However, if it contains even
a small amount of each of

87
00:07:35,506 --> 00:07:37,975
{\an1}their chakra, then
it is still fine.

88
00:07:38,642 --> 00:07:39,977
{\an1}In other words...

89
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:42,411
{\an1}It is not as if it
is unable to bloom.

90
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:47,450
{\an1}All that's affected is how
long it will take to bloom.

91
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,853
There's about
fifteen minutes to go.

92
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,856
{\an1}In that time, I shall stop
Obito and switch places

93
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,893
{\an1}with him by using
your Sage Power.

94
00:08:01,328 --> 00:08:02,763
This is bad.

95
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:05,599
{\an1}I must relay all that my
original body has heard to

96
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:07,333
the rest of the
Allied Forces.

97
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:11,237
{\an1}Are there any from
the Yamanaka Clan here?

98
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:13,273
Sir!

99
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:15,140
{\an1}Do you know the Mind
Transmission Jutsu?!

100
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:16,609
Uh, yes, sir!

101
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:17,744
I do, sir!

102
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:20,013
Good, then link
me to everyone!

103
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:23,147
{\an1}I'd like to explain about
that giant tree and the

104
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,716
{\an1}Infinite Tsukuyomi!

105
00:08:28,954 --> 00:08:30,621
This sensation!

106
00:08:31,722 --> 00:08:33,223
Grandfather!

107
00:08:34,324 --> 00:08:35,258
Ah!

108
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:37,060
{\an1}Is that you, Tsuna?

109
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:40,897
{\an1}This voice is unmistakably
Lord Hashirama's!

110
00:08:41,865 --> 00:08:44,333
{\an1}That means the Five Kage
are now close enough to be

111
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:46,335
{\an1}within range of my jutsu!

112
00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:48,137
Wait!

113
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:50,706
This is no time
for reminiscing!

114
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,042
{\an1}I have things I must
relay to you five and

115
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,442
{\an1}to everyone else!

116
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,210
{\an1}Listen carefully!

117
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,017
I'll retrieve a
little more chakra.

118
00:09:03,785 --> 00:09:05,752
{\an1}It'll take a while
for it to bloom.

119
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:10,390
So we're all...

120
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,258
just nourishment
for that tree?

121
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,660
That's it?!

122
00:09:14,694 --> 00:09:16,462
{\an1}That's what shinobi are?!

123
00:09:16,495 --> 00:09:18,898
Then how are we
supposed to fight it?!

124
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:21,701
{\an1}Plus we only have
about fifteen minutes?!

125
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:23,535
{\an1}We can't even get near it!

126
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:27,806
{\an1}And yet, doing nothing
will yield the same result.

127
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,374
{\an1}We must either cut down that
tree or defeat the caster

128
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:32,576
{\an1}within the remaining time.

129
00:09:33,711 --> 00:09:35,179
But...

130
00:09:35,212 --> 00:09:38,314
I told you not
to give up hope!

131
00:09:57,699 --> 00:09:59,133
{\an1}Easy for you to say!

132
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,601
{\an1}You're a Reanimation
from the past brought

133
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:01,902
back to life!

134
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:03,571
{\an1}We're still alive!

135
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:05,506
It's all over!

136
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,445
{\an1}If it's going to end
like this, we shouldn't

137
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,280
{\an1}have started it at all.

138
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:20,185
[scared chatter]

139
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,520
{\an1}Yes, that's right.

140
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:23,022
{\an1}Just stay like that.

141
00:10:23,355 --> 00:10:26,290
{\an1}I'll take you to a world
where there're no regrets.

142
00:10:42,873 --> 00:10:44,206
Naruto...

143
00:10:44,473 --> 00:10:46,076
{\an1}You throwing in the towel?

144
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,543
'Cause I'm not.

145
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,851
Let's go, Jugo.

146
00:10:55,885 --> 00:10:56,852
Right.

147
00:11:05,192 --> 00:11:06,460
These are...

148
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:10,097
{\an1}Feelings from Naruto's heart
coming through my jutsu.

149
00:11:10,397 --> 00:11:11,865
I can feel them!

150
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:29,815
Back then I kept
thinking that I should've

151
00:11:29,848 --> 00:11:31,315
{\an1}called out to him.

152
00:11:32,616 --> 00:11:35,219
{\an1}I thought about it
over and over.

153
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,658
{\an1}His thoughts are flowing in.

154
00:11:44,294 --> 00:11:45,428
That's why...

155
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:53,203
This is...

156
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,342
{\an1}This is from that day...

157
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:34,338
I...

158
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:02,764
I...

159
00:13:09,204 --> 00:13:10,905
I don't wanna
regret anything,

160
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,644
I never want to
think, "I should've!"

161
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,747
Naruto...

162
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:33,192
Plus...

163
00:13:33,457 --> 00:13:34,759
I can't just
make everything...

164
00:13:40,832 --> 00:13:43,100
{\an1}That we've all done up until
this point meaningless!

165
00:13:48,505 --> 00:13:49,773
Sasuke!

166
00:13:49,806 --> 00:13:51,274
{\an1}I'm coming with you!

167
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:52,275
[chuckle]

168
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,480
{\an1}Naruto Uzumaki...

169
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:02,117
Again and again.

170
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:17,363
Sorry to have to
borrow more chakra.

171
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:20,200
No worries.

172
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:22,302
We're counting
on you, Naruto!

173
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:28,808
{\an1}Hey Sasuke, you do
remember that only Sage

174
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:30,675
Jutsu works on
him, don't you?!

175
00:14:32,144 --> 00:14:34,112
I'm aware of
that I'm not you.

176
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,359
Karin!

177
00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:49,459
{\an1}Look right there.

178
00:14:49,492 --> 00:14:51,394
{\an1}Isn't that Sasuke's
Curse Mark patterning?

179
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:53,663
{\an1}But wait, I thought that he
lost the Curse Mark power?

180
00:14:53,696 --> 00:14:57,766
{\an1}Sage Jutsu Power's the
source of Jugo's Curse Mark.

181
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,935
{\an1}And with regard to Sasuke...

182
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:03,305
{\an1}When I experimentally
injected Jugo's chakra into

183
00:15:03,338 --> 00:15:06,674
{\an1}him, he immediately
unleashed the Curse Mark.

184
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:09,810
{\an1}So it's not surprising
Sasuke's Susano'o would

185
00:15:09,844 --> 00:15:13,114
{\an1}respond to Jugo's
chakra similarly.

186
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:17,450
{\an1}I suppose you could call
it a Sage Jutsu Susano'o.

187
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:21,021
{\an1}Sasuke Uchiha, huh?

188
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,957
{\an1}An Uchiha who shows
the same potential as

189
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,624
Madara once did.

190
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,194
{\an1}Maybe I'll go join them.

191
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,629
{\an1}You'll trip 'em up
and get stabbed again!

192
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,668
And Sasuke, your
power is unlike that

193
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:38,836
{\an1}of the two behind me.

194
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,807
{\an1}Or rather, unlike that of
any I've experimented on.

195
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:46,311
{\an1}It still hasn't come
close to its limits.

196
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,648
{\an1}I know, my gut tells me
based on intel gathered over

197
00:15:52,682 --> 00:15:57,453
{\an1}my entire life that you'll
one day be a shinobi who

198
00:15:57,486 --> 00:15:59,622
{\an1}surpasses Madara!

199
00:16:01,223 --> 00:16:04,459
{\an1}And Naruto Uzumaki, you
remind me so much of my

200
00:16:04,492 --> 00:16:07,462
{\an1}Elder Brother. You're a
foolish, naïve brat who

201
00:16:07,495 --> 00:16:10,966
{\an1}spouts idealisms at
the top of your voice.

202
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,036
{\an1}And yet, everyone likes you
and wants to depend on you.

203
00:16:17,037 --> 00:16:18,471
-Let's Go!
-Right!

204
00:16:18,504 --> 00:16:20,774
It'll be too
late for regrets.

205
00:16:20,808 --> 00:16:23,210
{\an1}Not that either one
of you has a future.

206
00:16:27,013 --> 00:16:29,315
{\an1}Those two really went
to face off against him?

207
00:16:29,349 --> 00:16:30,283
Yeah!

208
00:16:30,316 --> 00:16:31,783
{\an1}What should we all do?

209
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:34,320
{\an1}Let's ask the Five
Kage when they get here.

210
00:16:34,354 --> 00:16:35,854
{\an1}Is that really good enough?

211
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:43,561
{\an1}I look forward to the
battles we shall fight until

212
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:46,397
{\an1}I achieve my true dream.

213
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,099
And what is
your true dream?!

214
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,267
{\an1}I thought everything
we aimed for is right

215
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,236
{\an1}here in this village!

216
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:54,270
{\an1}You simply cannot see it.

217
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,572
{\an1}What's even further ahead.

218
00:16:56,605 --> 00:16:58,774
{\an1}Dreams of the far future.

219
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:02,745
{\an1}Well, then tell me
about them, Madara, please!

220
00:17:02,778 --> 00:17:05,781
Wait, these are
Lord First's memories?

221
00:17:07,282 --> 00:17:08,783
{\an1}Dreams of the future.

222
00:17:18,426 --> 00:17:21,528
{\an1}The simple fact that we
could convene this Five Kage

223
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:24,164
Summit with the
first Kage of each of

224
00:17:24,197 --> 00:17:25,832
{\an1}the Five Great Nations.

225
00:17:30,202 --> 00:17:33,172
Truly fills me
with gratitude!

226
00:17:35,474 --> 00:17:36,741
Elder Brother!

227
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:39,345
{\an1}The Hokage of the Land
of Fire's Hidden Leaf,

228
00:17:39,378 --> 00:17:42,514
shouldn't bow so
easily to the other Kage!

229
00:17:42,546 --> 00:17:45,183
{\an1}But I'm just so happy!

230
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,819
Lord Hokage,
raise your head.

231
00:17:50,254 --> 00:17:52,756
{\an1}This type of behavior
is just not becoming

232
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,590
{\an1}of a village leader.

233
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:57,794
{\an1}In any event, I did indeed
come here to endorse at

234
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,663
{\an1}least the gist of
Lord Hokage's pact.

235
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:03,732
{\an1}However, I'm not just going
to sign anything for free.

236
00:18:03,765 --> 00:18:05,401
I agree.

237
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:07,602
{\an1}And besides, if you
behave too humbly,

238
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:09,704
{\an1}you'll make us suspicious.

239
00:18:09,738 --> 00:18:12,606
{\an1}Distributing the Tailed
Beasts that Lord Hokage has

240
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,909
{\an1}collected to the other
villages is the condition

241
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:16,411
{\an1}of signing the treaty.

242
00:18:17,244 --> 00:18:19,680
{\an1}This is just a transaction,
not something one

243
00:18:19,713 --> 00:18:21,182
{\an1}should get emotional about.

244
00:18:21,982 --> 00:18:23,117
Exactly.

245
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,752
{\an1}We'll assign the Tailed
Beasts based on power

246
00:18:25,785 --> 00:18:27,754
balance, but
you're required to pay.

247
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:29,055
{\an1}They're not free?

248
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:30,223
Shut it!

249
00:18:35,495 --> 00:18:37,296
This was the
very first summit!

250
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:38,664
Yes.

251
00:18:38,697 --> 00:18:41,300
{\an1}And it was what led to
the end of minor conflicts.

252
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:55,345
{\an1}In our village, a certain
temple's acolytes have

253
00:18:55,378 --> 00:18:57,646
been keeping a
Tailed Beast sealed away.

254
00:18:57,681 --> 00:19:00,150
{\an1}And because we already
possess one, we do not have

255
00:19:00,183 --> 00:19:02,352
{\an1}any need for another one.

256
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:06,021
{\an1}Instead, we would like an
alternative compensation for

257
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:08,290
{\an1}our collaboration
in this pact.

258
00:19:08,324 --> 00:19:10,126
{\an1}Would that be acceptable?

259
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:12,294
{\an1}What do you want?

260
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,296
Our nation is
completely covered in sand.

261
00:19:15,964 --> 00:19:18,066
{\an1}Thus, we'd like the
adjoining Hidden Leaf to

262
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:21,768
{\an1}share arable land with us
instead of a Tailed Beast.

263
00:19:21,802 --> 00:19:24,071
{\an1}And the other nations to
hand over thirty percent of

264
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:27,074
{\an1}your Tailed Beast
purchase price as well.

265
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:29,076
{\an1}Don't mess around with us!

266
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:29,909
What?!

267
00:19:29,942 --> 00:19:31,878
This a joke,
Lord Kazekage?!

268
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:34,213
{\an1}I won't sign on to this
pact unless all of you

269
00:19:34,247 --> 00:19:37,083
accept the terms
I've laid out!

270
00:19:37,116 --> 00:19:40,118
{\an1}Mine is a sand-bound
nation with zero fertility!

271
00:19:40,152 --> 00:19:43,088
{\an1}It's only natural to use my
village's Tailed Beast to

272
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:45,223
{\an1}full advantage in
dealings with the four

273
00:19:45,257 --> 00:19:47,092
{\an1}other Great Nations!

274
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:50,828
{\an1}We four other nations could
also join our forces and

275
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:52,563
{\an1}crush the Land of Wind.

276
00:20:09,011 --> 00:20:10,679
{\an1}It is true that our
nations have never

277
00:20:10,712 --> 00:20:12,915
{\an1}gotten along in the past.

278
00:20:12,948 --> 00:20:15,384
{\an1}But we each did what we
had to do to protect our

279
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:17,919
{\an1}brethren and our clans.

280
00:20:17,952 --> 00:20:20,588
{\an1}Perhaps at times we
had no other choice.

281
00:20:20,622 --> 00:20:23,324
{\an1}And now, today, even
if our Five Nation

282
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:25,058
{\an1}Treaty comes to be.

283
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:28,195
{\an1}I honestly can't say how
long it will last or even

284
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:30,030
{\an1}if we can hold onto it.

285
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:35,034
{\an1}But I've got this dream that
at some time in the future,

286
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,638
{\an1}there will come a day when
shinobi will collaborate,

287
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:42,041
{\an1}and help each othe, with
one heart, regardless

288
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,542
{\an1}of their affiliation.

289
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:47,245
That is my dream
of the future.

290
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:55,852
{\an1}I ask you to take the
first step toward

291
00:20:55,886 --> 00:20:57,689
{\an1}that dream today!

292
00:20:58,055 --> 00:21:02,792
So, please,
please, please, please!

293
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:04,428
I beg of you!

294
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:07,763
{\an1}All of my- no, our
beloved children!

295
00:21:07,797 --> 00:21:11,434
{\an1}Now is the time to take all
the pain, the frustration

296
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:15,370
{\an1}and suffering we shinobi
have endured and weave it

297
00:21:15,403 --> 00:21:18,540
{\an1}into our true dream!

298
00:22:59,263 --> 00:23:01,864
{\an1}<i>Your past is filtering</i>
<i>into me through the others.</i>

299
00:23:01,898 --> 00:23:05,402
{\an1}<i>Naruto Uzumaki, you are</i>
<i>the one who is uniting</i>

300
00:23:05,436 --> 00:23:07,570
{\an1}<i>everyone right now.</i>

301
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:10,506
{\an1}<i>Your tempestuous history</i>
<i>made you who you are.</i>

302
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,242
<i>And your way of</i>
<i>life has brought hope</i>

303
00:23:13,276 --> 00:23:15,310
{\an1}<i>into everyone's hearts!</i>

304
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:19,648
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Pursuing Hope."</i>

305
00:23:20,682 --> 00:23:21,849

306
00:23:21,882 --> 00:23:23,785
<i>Let's cut down</i>
