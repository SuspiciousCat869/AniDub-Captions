1
00:00:09,186 --> 00:00:11,589
[Naruto]
Heh, playing with those
building blocks...

2
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:14,390
I knew that I could
do it now that I'm
at this level!

3
00:00:14,857 --> 00:00:17,227
{\an1}I'd expect you to pull
off that simple act.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,795
{\an1}But the next one's not so easy,
that's a fact.

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,568
{\an4}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Oh, so this is connected to</i>
<i>that room where I scuffled</i>
<i>with the Nine Tails' chakra.</i>

6
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:27,002
<i>[Killer Bee]</i>
<i>Take a good look.</i>

7
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,906
{\an5}[Naruto]
And now there's a statue
of the Eight Tails, huh?
What a pain.

8
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:37,311
{\an1}Here's the entrance to another
room, just one step remaining:

9
00:00:37,345 --> 00:00:40,014
{\an1}We're gonna have our final
Tailed Beast training!

10
00:00:40,047 --> 00:00:41,582
{\an1}So quit grumbling, y'hear?

11
00:00:46,353 --> 00:00:51,124
{\an1}It's time for you to learn the
ultimate Jinchuriki jutsu,
do you hear what I say?

12
00:00:51,157 --> 00:00:53,560
{\an1}If you're ready, just
give me the okay!

13
00:00:53,993 --> 00:00:55,462
Yeah, okay!

14
00:00:55,495 --> 00:00:58,030
{\an1}I mean, I do have to
learn how to control all
of this power, after all.

15
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,399
{\an1}All right, so what
do I do first, then?

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,337
{\an1}You gotta enter Tailed beast
mode, then enter tailed
beast state-a!

17
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,206
This is step one.
So get it done!

18
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:11,142
{\an1}Come on, don't you
think that's too risky?

19
00:01:11,175 --> 00:01:13,678
{\an1}I don't want to
transform into
Tailed Beast state!

20
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:17,649
Nah, you can do it!
You should be fine,
fool, ya fool!

21
00:01:17,682 --> 00:01:22,552
{\an4}You only extracted
Tailed Beast chakra pure,
so you won't rampage,
I'm sure!

22
00:01:22,586 --> 00:01:23,553
Fool, ya fool!

23
00:01:23,786 --> 00:01:24,688
{\an1}All right, then.

24
00:01:26,122 --> 00:01:28,424
Hrrrh!

25
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:31,827
{\an1}Visualize your Tailed Beast!
Yea-eah!

26
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:35,665
Hraaaaah!

27
00:01:36,232 --> 00:01:37,500
Yip Yip Yip!

28
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,070
Whoaa!

29
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:44,239
Aw, man.

30
00:01:44,673 --> 00:01:46,508
No go? Too bad.

31
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,876
{\an1}Well, it's not like you're
chummy with the Nine Tails.

32
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,146
{\an1}I guess Tailed Beast
Transformation is an
utter failure.

33
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,949
{\an1}[Eight Tails]
So how are you going to teach
him the Tailed Beast Bomb?

34
00:01:56,983 --> 00:02:01,187
{\an1}That's a move a Jinchuriki
can only achieve in
Tailed Beast State, Bee.

35
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:02,422
Hrrm.

36
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,158
Oh, wow. I'm dead
tired after that.

37
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:08,628
{\an1}You mean I went and used
all of that Nine-Tails'
chakra for nothing?!

38
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:13,532
{\an4}[Eight Tails]
By the way, shouldn't you
tell him the risks of
Tailed Beast Mode, too?

39
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:18,136
{\an1}Remember, the risks for
you and Naruto are
fundamentally different.

40
00:02:18,603 --> 00:02:20,871
{\an1}Look, I'll explain.
Let me out.

41
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:24,375
{\an1}I'll just hand over the baton
for the mumble jumble.

42
00:02:24,408 --> 00:02:26,277
{\an1}Saves me from the
verbal fumble.

43
00:02:26,577 --> 00:02:30,348
Hey! Naruto!
This is Eight Tails
speaking, not Bee.

44
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:32,650
Now, listen
closely!

45
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:35,018
{\an1}Huh? This is
all getting so
confusing.

46
00:02:35,385 --> 00:02:38,521
{\an1}Well, at least I won't
have to listen to all
of his dumb rhymes.

47
00:02:39,155 --> 00:02:42,726
{\an1}First, I'll cover the risks of
the Tailed Beast chakra mode.

48
00:02:43,258 --> 00:02:46,796
{\an1}Wait, risks? There are
risks to using this mode?!

49
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:51,400
{\an1}Of course! It's very important,
so be quiet and listen.

50
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,469
Yeah. Okay.

51
00:04:36,595 --> 00:04:39,598
"Secrets of the
Reanimation Jutsu"

52
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:45,136
The main risk when you
switch to Tailed Beast
chakra mode is,

53
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:47,338
{\an1}Yeah?

54
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:50,974
{\an1}<i>Basically, while you're using</i>
<i>the Tailed Beast chakra mode,</i>

55
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:54,311
{\an1}<i>The Nine Tails is siphoning</i>
<i>away your own personal chakra,</i>

56
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:59,416
{\an1}<i>because you're temporarily</i>
<i>shelving your Naruto chakra</i>
<i>to use the Nine Tails' chakra.</i>

57
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:00,383
Okay.

58
00:05:02,284 --> 00:05:06,589
{\an1}<i>And, obviously, if he drains</i>
<i>your Naruto chakra to zero,</i>
<i>then you're a goner.</i>

59
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:08,224
{\an1}Haaaah??

60
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:11,694
{\an1}But then how come Octopops is
always okay when he uses it?!

61
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,931
{\an1}Naruto, you've merely taken
Nine Tails' chakra from him.

62
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:17,732
You haven't
truly tamed him.

63
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:22,971
{\an1}Bee and I used to be like that,
too, long time ago, fighting
over each other's chakra.

64
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:28,242
{\an1}<i>Oh and, I wouldn't advise</i>
<i>using Shadow Clones in</i>
<i>Tailed Beast chakra mode.</i>

65
00:05:29,142 --> 00:05:35,081
{\an4}Nine Tails will take an equal
amount of your chakra from
each clone, so you'll be
drained instantly and die.

66
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:38,918
{\an1}[chuckle] Don't worry, I've
got plenty of my own chakra,

67
00:05:38,952 --> 00:05:43,456
{\an4}because for my entire life,
I've been getting all the
chakra that's always leaking
out of the Nine Tails!

68
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,928
{\an1}You idiot! Don't underestimate
the Nine Tails! He'll wipe out
your chakra just like that!

69
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:54,699
{\an1}Restoring your stolen
chakra takes a lot of time!
So be careful!

70
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,038
{\an4}<i>If you get carried away and</i>
<i>use only the Nine Tails'</i>
<i>chakra during a battle,</i>
<i>you'll end up dead.</i>

71
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:01,805
Huhh??

72
00:06:03,474 --> 00:06:07,878
{\an1}Normally, you'd negotiate
with your Tailed Beast and
agree on a chakra exchange.

73
00:06:07,912 --> 00:06:10,413
{\an1}Not that I ever see the
Nine Tails doing that.

74
00:06:11,514 --> 00:06:16,184
{\an1}<i>Finally, there's a limit</i>
<i>to the chakra you forcibly</i>
<i>pulled from the Nine Tails.</i>

75
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:22,925
{\an4}Auhh! It's too risky!
Does that mean I can't
even perform the ultimate
Jinchuriki jutsu?!

76
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:25,994
You'd better give up on
the Tailed Beast Bomb.

77
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:29,798
For now, you should just
focus on polishing up
your own special move.

78
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:33,401
{\an1}Tailed Beast Bomb?
Wait, what kind of
jutsu is that?

79
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:41,575
{\an4}It's simple. You just change
your chakra's form, pool it
in your mouth, compress it,
and then release it.

80
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:43,443
That's all
there is to it.

81
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:49,015
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>That one, huh...?</i>

82
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,453
{\an1}Basically... It feels
just like throwing up.

83
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,759
{\an1}Okay, let me just try it
while I'm in this mode!

84
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:02,093
Haugh!

85
00:07:02,727 --> 00:07:03,494
Like this?!

86
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:06,464
[retching]
Huaagh!

87
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:10,534
{\an1}It's impossible without
being transformed in
Tailed Beast state.

88
00:07:10,868 --> 00:07:13,437
{\an1}I've explained everything.
Now back to Bee.

89
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:15,906
{\an1}[Killer Bee]
It can't be helped,
we must relent!

90
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:22,545
{\an4}Well, the only thing left
is to try your special move
while you're in Tailed Beast
chakra mode. Gotta be diligent!

91
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:27,817
{\an1}But I can't do Rasengan without
at least one Shadow Clone.
It won't work in this mode!

92
00:07:28,484 --> 00:07:31,119
{\an1}I need two pairs of hands:
one for the chakra release,

93
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:34,924
{\an1}and one for the rotation,
compression, and containment
of the change in form.

94
00:07:34,957 --> 00:07:38,360
{\an1}Tailed Beast chakra should feel
like an extension of your limbs,

95
00:07:38,393 --> 00:07:41,029
{\an1}but not to be mistaken
for your actual ones!

96
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:42,396
Yeah, okay!

97
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,101
{\an1}Do you mean
something like this?

98
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,168
{\an1}Very nice, that's a good start.

99
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:51,939
{\an1}Now go on, bring up that
special move of yours and
see if we can use any part.

100
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,674
{\an1}All right, here goes!

101
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:55,976
Rasengan!!

102
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:02,314
Huh?!

103
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:03,883
{\an1}Wait, but that's...!

104
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:07,285
{\an1}[Killer Bee]
Change in chakra form with
rotation and compression.

105
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:08,754
Augh!

106
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:13,792
{\an7}<i>That jutsu! It's just like</i>
<i>the Tailed Beast Bomb...</i>
<i>fool, ya fool!</i>

107
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:21,365
{\an1}Hey! Naruto! Who was the
person that taught you that
jutsu, ya dimwit fool?!

108
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:24,467
{\an1}Huh?! Oh, Pervy Sage did.

109
00:08:25,235 --> 00:08:27,938
{\an1}Uh, I mean, Jiraiya Sensei
taught it to me.

110
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:31,841
{\an1}Although the Fourth Hokage
was actually the one who
first invented it.

111
00:08:33,977 --> 00:08:38,547
{\an7}<i>[Killer Bee]</i>
<i>The Fourth Hokage?! What a</i>
<i>coincidence! How fateful!</i>
<i>Truly not a shame!</i>

112
00:08:39,548 --> 00:08:44,453
{\an1}The Rasengan! It's put
together just like the Tailed
Beast Bomb! They're the same!

113
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:47,990
The Rasengan must've
been modeled on this
Tailed Beast move.

114
00:08:48,023 --> 00:08:50,458
It's incredible, but it
has to be the truth!

115
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,697
{\an1}<i>It's like he entrusted you</i>
<i>with the Tailed Beast Bomb.</i>
<i>You couldn't be luckier!</i>

116
00:08:56,564 --> 00:08:57,531
Mmm.

117
00:08:57,564 --> 00:08:59,700
It's easy to achieve
in Tailed Beast mode.

118
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:03,704
{\an1}But when human, the change
in chakra form is difficult,
almost impossible.

119
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:08,340
{\an1}And also, if you add
in rotation, then that
makes it more plausible.

120
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:10,110
{\an1}Yeah, I guess so.

121
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,212
{\an1}But this move isn't
working as well as
my regular Rasengan.

122
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:18,718
{\an1}Tailed Beast chakra is a
combination of positive blue
chakra and negative red chakra.

123
00:09:19,284 --> 00:09:21,319
<i>Their balance</i>
<i>is the key.</i>

124
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:24,489
[growl]

125
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,367
Now, when you're
compressing it,

126
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:41,905
{\an1}if you make the red to
blue ratio two to eight,
then it'll form a sphere!

127
00:09:42,238 --> 00:09:43,272
Go on! Try it!

128
00:09:43,706 --> 00:09:44,373
Okay!

129
00:09:45,908 --> 00:09:49,746
Hrrrh!

130
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:53,715
Huaagh!

131
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:58,252
No, your ratio's
still out of whack.

132
00:09:58,286 --> 00:10:02,057
{\an1}You had red nine-point-five
to blue zero-point-five
for that attack.

133
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,358
{\an1}It's harder than it sounds
to grasp the knack.

134
00:10:04,825 --> 00:10:08,230
{\an1}All this talk of positive,
negative, red, blue, ratios,

135
00:10:08,462 --> 00:10:11,198
{\an1}Half the time, I don't
even understand what
you're talking about!

136
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:14,201
{\an1}<i>Besides, the</i>
<i>Rasengan is heavy.</i>

137
00:10:14,235 --> 00:10:16,669
{\an1}If I don't use both of my hands,
it just falls apart.

138
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,906
{\an1}How am I supposed to focus on
these tiny little details?

139
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,109
{\an1}I'm the type that learns
by doing, you know?

140
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,478
{\an1}So for this Tailed
Beast Rasengan...

141
00:10:26,812 --> 00:10:29,014
{\an1}I'm just gonna have to keep
doing it and doing it,

142
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:31,315
{\an1}and I'm not gonna stop
until I get it right!

143
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:32,684
[pain]
Agh! Ngh!

144
00:10:34,153 --> 00:10:37,222
{\an1}It's much more
difficult in human form.
It's tougher to toil.

145
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:41,492
{\an1}Just rest a bit. Those
wounds on your hands are
a type of jutsu recoil.

146
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:46,630
{\an1}Like I told you, I can't
worry about the little
details like that!

147
00:10:46,663 --> 00:10:47,397
Hah.

148
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,402
{\an1}Octopops, you said that the
ratio should be eight to two,

149
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:55,071
{\an1}so keep watching me and tell
me when I get it right.

150
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:57,840
{\an1}I'll try to learn it by
feeling and just remember it.

151
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,775
{\an1}Boy, you sure are persistent!

152
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:03,378
{\an1}Ha! Very well! Then I'll
just swallow my words
and I'll help you tell!

153
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,051
Unh...

154
00:11:09,818 --> 00:11:11,853
{\an1}<i>[Madara]</i>
<i>The woman is still alive.</i>

155
00:11:12,687 --> 00:11:16,323
{\an1}It appears that she's
compatible with Lord
Orochimaru's Curse Mark.

156
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:19,493
{\an1}His chakra continues
to flow through her
body even now.

157
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:21,328
{\an1}I can't kill
her yet.

158
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:25,632
{\an1}[Madara]
No. You must finish
her off, here and now.

159
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:29,368
{\an1}She knows where our hideout
is and how to get inside.

160
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,839
I'm afraid she needs to
be alive if I'm going to

161
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:35,174
extract and collect Lord
Orochimaru's chakra.

162
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:41,113
{\an1}My body is essentially
Lord Orochimaru's right now.

163
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:48,452
{\an4}<i>His chakra is critical if I'm</i>
<i>to expand my power, and</i>
<i>increase the binding strength</i>
<i>of the Reanimation Jutsu!</i>

164
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:52,356
And something else
is necessary.

165
00:11:53,325 --> 00:11:56,994
<i>This jutsu requires</i>
<i>living human bodies.</i>

166
00:11:57,328 --> 00:12:00,130
{\an1}Those are the reasons this
woman is being kept alive.

167
00:12:01,298 --> 00:12:05,302
{\an1}<i>Increasing our battle</i>
<i>strength. Doesn't that</i>
<i>further your cause?</i>

168
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:07,036
{\an1}<i>Or am I wrong?</i>

169
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,973
A friend today may be
an enemy tomorrow.

170
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,110
There is a chance that
your advantage will put
me at a disadvantage.

171
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:19,014
{\an1}So it appears that you
still don't trust me.
What'll it take?

172
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:26,321
{\an1}The Reanimation Jutsu.
Prove to me right now that it
really requires living bodies.

173
00:12:26,854 --> 00:12:27,521
And...

174
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:33,361
{\an1}Tell me all of its secrets.
Including how to stop it!

175
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:36,264
And if I say no?

176
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:42,434
{\an1}You will surely not reach what
you desire, and what you desire
will become something else.

177
00:12:42,869 --> 00:12:45,038
{\an1}It will be your life!

178
00:12:46,306 --> 00:12:48,774
{\an7}<i>Taking on the Rinnegan</i>
<i>now won't help me.</i>

179
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:53,112
{\an7}<i>Well, I still</i>
<i>have a hand to play.</i>
<i>No need to rush it.</i>

180
00:12:54,013 --> 00:12:57,582
{\an4}Very well. But
there's no one
here to use as
a sacrifice.

181
00:13:00,318 --> 00:13:02,787
{\an1}And as I told you,
this woman is off-limits.

182
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:11,728
{\an1}Just who are these two?
Wait, aren't they?

183
00:13:12,696 --> 00:13:14,530
Danzo's lapdogs.

184
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:19,035
They've been under a
Sharingan-based genjutsu
since I captured them.

185
00:13:20,337 --> 00:13:21,338
[crack]

186
00:13:23,773 --> 00:13:25,507
{\an1}You certainly
are merciless.

187
00:13:26,441 --> 00:13:28,543
I've done the prep
work for you.

188
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:33,982
{\an4}Recall the soul of the one
I just killed and revive
him in the other with
the Reanimation Jutsu.

189
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:02,841
{\an1}Just so you know, this
is categorized as a type
of Summoning Jutsu.

190
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:08,646
{\an1}It involves summoning a
soul of one of the dead
back from the Afterlife,

191
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,715
{\an1}<i>and bringing it</i>
<i>to this world.</i>

192
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:14,218
{\an1}<i>To achieve that, you need</i>
<i>a certain amount of flesh,</i>

193
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:19,457
{\an1}taken from the person
that you want to revive.

194
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:23,526
{\an4}<i>Any tissue that</i>
<i>contains personal</i>
<i>identification</i>
<i>material.</i>

195
00:14:23,893 --> 00:14:26,396
{\an1}<i>Without it, the Reanimation</i>
<i>Jutsu won't work.</i>

196
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:28,965
{\an1}<i>Howerver, spirits</i>
<i>that can't be found,</i>

197
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:33,035
{\an1}for example, those
that have been sealed
away in another place,

198
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:34,970
{\an1}cannot be revived
in this way.

199
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,910
{\an1}<i>In the past, Lord Orochimaru</i>
<i>tried to bring back the</i>
<i>Fourth Hokage and failed.</i>

200
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:48,216
{\an1}<i>The god of death now has the</i>
<i>Hokage's soul because Minato</i>
<i>used the Reaper Death Seal.</i>

201
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:54,521
{\an4}<i>And during the destruction</i>
<i>of the Hidden Leaf Village,</i>
<i>the Third Hokage also used</i>
<i>the same sealing jutsu.</i>

202
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:06,032
Uwagh!

203
00:15:13,105 --> 00:15:16,108
{\an1}The First and Second Hokage
were taken along, too.

204
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:22,713
{\an1}Which means the Reanimation
Jutsu can't be used on the
First through Fourth Hokage?

205
00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:24,615
{\an1}Yes, that's right.

206
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:27,485
{\an1}I've revived many.

207
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,922
{\an1}But harvesting their
personal information
material was a real ordeal.

208
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,259
{\an1}It's essentially just
grave robbing.

209
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:40,363
{\an1}Sometimes they're so rotted,
you can't even tell who it is.

210
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,166
{\an1}I had a lot of failures
along the way.

211
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,600
{\an1}That's the jutsu formula?

212
00:15:57,845 --> 00:16:00,748
Yeaarrghh!

213
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:05,086
{\an1}That's it. That's how you
turn a living person into a
vessel for the dead one's soul.

214
00:16:05,752 --> 00:16:08,588
{\an1}<i>That completes the</i>
<i>Reanimation Jutsu.</i>

215
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:12,460
[gasping]

216
00:16:12,926 --> 00:16:13,927
Where am I?!

217
00:16:15,462 --> 00:16:19,232
{\an1}This is truly the greatest
and most powerful jutsu
in all of the shinobi world.

218
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:25,971
{\an4}Developed by the Second
Hokage and perfected by
Lord Orochimaru, it remains
their greatest legacy.

219
00:16:30,476 --> 00:16:32,877
This tag
suppresses
free will.

220
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:39,417
{\an4}Once given certain commands,
the revived recovers all
abilities possessed
during life.

221
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:43,920
{\an1}And then he becomes an
immortal pawn, bound to
follow all of my orders.

222
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:51,027
{\an4}<i>Even rare and unusual</i>
<i>abilities like the Rinnegan</i>
<i>of the Six Paths and Itachi's</i>
<i>Sharingan are restored.</i>

223
00:16:51,827 --> 00:16:55,798
{\an1}But, I wasn't able to find
Shisui Uchiha's body.

224
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:02,171
{\an1}And Jiraiya's body was
deep underwater, where the
pressure prevented retrieval.

225
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,707
{\an1}Now, as for Danzo's right eye
and the Six Pain's weapons,

226
00:17:06,274 --> 00:17:09,043
<i>I don't have all their</i>
<i>personal information</i>
<i>material, but--</i>

227
00:17:09,077 --> 00:17:10,512
{\an1}Don't push your luck.

228
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,249
{\an1}Well, all right. I suppose
we have enough pawns for now.

229
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:20,120
{\an1}Such an ideal jutsu.
It must have some
serious risks.

230
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:21,421
[chuckle]

231
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:24,458
{\an1}That is the most brilliant
part of this jutsu!

232
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:26,959
{\an1}There is no risk to
the caster at all!

233
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:28,461
[incredulous]
What?

234
00:17:29,195 --> 00:17:30,563
Yes, it's true.

235
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:33,599
The Reanimation Jutsu
doesn't carry any
risk with it.

236
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:35,834
Well, except for
one possibility.

237
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:37,102
Hmm?

238
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:40,639
{\an1}Because it is such an
amazing and powerful jutsu,

239
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:43,707
{\an1}whoever wields it is sure to
become famous far and wide.

240
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:47,945
{\an1}I will eventually be more well
known than even Madara Uchiha.

241
00:17:48,413 --> 00:17:52,283
{\an1}Then again, a bookworm
like me really has
zero desire for fame.

242
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:54,018
{\an1}I don't want to
become a target.

243
00:17:54,485 --> 00:17:56,187
{\an1}Don't get ahead of yourself!

244
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,557
Every action is
followed by reaction.

245
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,558
You need to
stay focused.

246
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:05,894
{\an1}Thank you for the warning.
I think the only real
risk to this jutsu,

247
00:18:06,162 --> 00:18:08,931
{\an1}Is simply that I've
given you this
information about it.

248
00:18:16,371 --> 00:18:18,240
{\an1}All right,
I'm leaving now.

249
00:18:18,574 --> 00:18:21,776
{\an1}We academics are better suited
to being in gloomy places.

250
00:18:22,076 --> 00:18:26,447
{\an1}Hold it! You haven't told me how
to stop the Reanimation Jutsu!

251
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,884
{\an1}Oh, yes! That's right,
I almost forgot about
that part, didn't I?

252
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:33,954
{\an1}Even killing the caster
won't stop this jutsu.

253
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,721
{\an1}So how does
one stop it?

254
00:18:37,691 --> 00:18:39,192
It's simple.

255
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:42,995
{\an1}You manipulate the controller
of the Reanimation Jutsu
into weaving the signs,

256
00:18:43,028 --> 00:18:46,632
{\an1}dog, horse, and tiger, and
then uttering, "Release."

257
00:18:46,665 --> 00:18:48,866
{\an1}You could use your
Sharingan, perhaps.

258
00:18:49,535 --> 00:18:53,037
{\an1}<i>Or your other choice is to</i>
<i>seal away the revived souls.</i>

259
00:18:53,672 --> 00:18:55,673
You had better
not be lying.

260
00:18:56,107 --> 00:18:58,610
{\an1}Believe me, I'm not brave
enough to lie to you.

261
00:19:01,945 --> 00:19:04,348
{\an1}Anyway, this
conversation is over.

262
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:06,283
{\an1}I told you all that
you have to do.

263
00:19:06,316 --> 00:19:07,351
{\an1}I'm leaving.

264
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,056
{\an7}<i>As long as I have the</i>
<i>Reanimation Jutsu and that</i>
<i>other jutsu, I'm invincible.</i>

265
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:18,594
{\an1}<i>One day I'll unravel the truth</i>
<i>of the Sage of Six Paths.</i>

266
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:24,467
{\an1}Did you stick a White
Zetsu spore on him?

267
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,835
Of course.

268
00:19:27,302 --> 00:19:32,440
{\an1}Then, Black Zetsu, you
ought to get started
on our other program.

269
00:19:32,474 --> 00:19:33,907
All right.

270
00:19:37,478 --> 00:19:40,314
{\an1}[Ao]
We would have missed this
without Muta Aburame's intel.

271
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:48,421
{\an1}A large army's coming
underground! We must extend
our sensing range deeper!

272
00:19:48,756 --> 00:19:52,058
{\an1}It appears that they're
planning on passing right
under our troops' feet!

273
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,294
{\an1}<i>Will they attack</i>
<i>us from the rear?!</i>

274
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,995
Gahh! Dig 'em up
with Earth Style!

275
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,931
{\an1}We have to notify Kitsuchi
of this immediately.

276
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,135
{\an1}Intel Unit! Relay
this to Kitsuchi.

277
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,403
{\an1}Tell him the
following:

278
00:20:04,935 --> 00:20:05,671
Incoming!

279
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,271
Got it.

280
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,175
There's
new intel!

281
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,777
{\an1}Well, it's about time!

282
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:14,779
There's approximately
twenty thousand enemy,

283
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:17,548
underground at
coordinates
twenty-five by thirty!

284
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:18,582
So that's
their plan.

285
00:20:25,322 --> 00:20:27,390
Reinforcements. Come.

286
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:29,925
{\an1}Reanimation Jutsu.

287
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:33,929
{\an1}And it has been refined
since Second Hokage
Tobirama's time.

288
00:20:36,565 --> 00:20:40,401
{\an1}It's really quite a feat
to control this many
souls at one time.

289
00:20:49,142 --> 00:20:50,844
Kiba!
And Shino!

290
00:20:51,411 --> 00:20:53,046
{\an1}That sure was quick, Kiba.

291
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,649
{\an1}They told us to rendezvous
with you guys here.

292
00:20:55,682 --> 00:20:57,718
{\an1}So does that mean
the enemy's nearby?

293
00:21:03,122 --> 00:21:04,123
[both]
Ready...

294
00:21:04,557 --> 00:21:06,025
{\an1}[both]
All right, Earth Style: Erupt!

295
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,428
{\an1}<i>[Zabuza]</i>
<i>It seems that this is</i>
<i>neither heaven nor hell.</i>

296
00:23:01,262 --> 00:23:04,232
{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>This is the world of the living.</i>
<i>You shouldn't be here.</i>

297
00:23:05,065 --> 00:23:07,902
{\an1}<i>[Haru]</i>
<i>Please, Kakashi, you</i>
<i>must stop us once again!</i>

298
00:23:08,636 --> 00:23:12,105
{\an1}<i>[Zabuza]</i>
<i>I already died once.</i>
<i>I died human!</i>

299
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,511
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>An Old Nemesis Returns.</i>

300
00:23:17,845 --> 00:23:19,613
[Kakashi]
Yes, I know.
