1
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,520
-We-- we did it.

2
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,460
We did it!

3
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,410
-Yes.

4
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,450
IZUMO (VOICEOVER): No doubt
it, that was one close shave.

5
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,430
If not for Shikamaru's quick
assessment of the situation

6
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,470
we'd have been done before.

7
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,550
Man, he really is
something, this gu.

8
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,580
No wonder Asuma
respects him so highly.

9
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,590
-Shikamaru!

10
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,410
Are you OK?

11
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,610
-All right. That's--
that's one down.

12
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,560
-Yeah.

13
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,410
And one more to go.

14
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,410
-If you wanted my help, Hidan,
you should have asked sooner.

15
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,530
-It was you!
You're the slow one, Kakuzu!

16
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,640
It was on purpose, wasn't it?

17
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,470
-You were the one who told me
to stay out it at the start.

18
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,500
I really don't think
you're in any position

19
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,620
to complain right now.

20
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,470
-All right, all right.

21
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
Point taken.

22
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,640
So maybe I did tell
you not to butt in.

23
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,580
But I assure you,
my friend, it wasn't

24
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,530
out of disrespect, or
anything like that.

25
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,530
Anyway, Kakuzu, would you mind
bringing my body over here

26
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,540
for me?

27
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,620
Come on, Kakuzu.

28
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,480
Won't you please bring
my body back to my head?

29
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,420
Please, Kakuzu.

30
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,580
Old friend.
Pretty please.

31
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,620
Huh?

32
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,630
No, hey, wait!

33
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,480
What are you doing?

34
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,510
I asked you to bring my body
to my head, not the other way

35
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,470
around.

36
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,460
Don't you get it?

37
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,430
-It's lighter this way.

38
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,410
-What do I care?

39
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,630
This isn't about you.

40
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,590
Hey!

41
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,450
Are you even listening to me?

42
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,410
[theme song]

43
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,420
-Ow, ow!

44
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,430
That hurts!

45
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,480
Hey, Kakuzu.
You're pulling my hair.

46
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,510
Do you mind?

47
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,540
-I would think your heck
wound would hurt more.

48
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,420
-You idiot, of course it does.

49
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,640
It hurts like a son of a bitch.

50
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,520
This is no ordinary
injury, let me tell you.

51
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,620
ASUMA (VOICEOVER): Incredible.

52
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,410
He's-- he's still alive.

53
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,470
-Yeah, it really,
really hurts, you know?

54
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,630
You fools have no idea
how incredibly painful

55
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,460
it is having your
head sliced off!

56
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,510
-What's going on?

57
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,510
That doesn't make sense.

58
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,510
-I don't know how
to explain this one.

59
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,520
I mean, how did--

60
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,630
-Yeah, but you gotta
look on the bright side.

61
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,510
Even if he's still
alive, so long

62
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,500
as he's not attached
to his body,

63
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,590
he can't perform any jutsu.

64
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,500
He might be immortal, but
he's completely useless.

65
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,470
-That's true.

66
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,610
That means just one left to go.

67
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,490
-Yeah.

68
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,470
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
But still, this guy-- I

69
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,600
suspect he may be even
stronger and faster

70
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,580
than mister immortal.

71
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,630
And someone who won't let
himself get carried away.

72
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,550
A cool customer.

73
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,440
Not phased a bit by
his comrade going down.

74
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,480
A heart of stone.

75
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,460
I don't think we've
seen his true power yet.

76
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,520
Maybe that's intentional,
to make us overconfident.

77
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,460
This kind of guy is cagey,
always gauging his opponent,

78
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,640
looking for any way
to gain an advantage.

79
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,520
It would be in his
best interest to have

80
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,570
us thinking we've
got the upper hand.

81
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,451
-Shikamaru!

82
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,470
KOTETSU (VOICEOVER):
Shikamaru's at his limit.

83
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,620
And Captain Asuma's wounded.

84
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,530
While we may have
gained the upper hand

85
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,530
by disabling one
of the Akatsuki,

86
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,440
it also means we've created an
opportunity for us to escape.

87
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,490
In either case my main worry
is Shikamaru's condition.

88
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,590
-Can't leave ourselves
open to attack!

89
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,590
-Enough of this.

90
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,451
-Captain Asuma!

91
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,440
-Since you asked for my help I'm
giving it, whether you want it

92
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,580
or not.

93
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,271
-Yeah, all right. Fine.

94
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:27,560
Ow!

95
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,430
Hey, that hurts!

96
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,470
-Just hold still.

97
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,410
-Those two.

98
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,430
What are they up to now?

99
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,430
-That should do it.

100
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,550
-Ah.

101
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,540
That's better.

102
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,630
-His head--

103
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,420
-The other one reattached it.

104
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,480
-Finally in one piece again.

105
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,440
-Don't move it too much yet.
or it'll come right off.

106
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,470
-Don't be such a nag, Kakuzu.

107
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,480
-What?

108
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,430
What in the world
are we up against?

109
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,640
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
One of them's immortal

110
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,500
and the other has a jutsu that
can sew a body back together?

111
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,550
Man.

112
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,520
It's just one thing after
another with these guys.

113
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,530
They're both so skilled.

114
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,440
-Your battle prep
and repartee are as

115
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,500
drawn out and tedious
as your rituals.

116
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,420
Just stick with the cash cow.

117
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,630
-Ah.

118
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,460
I better be sure to
pay him back in spades.

119
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,480
It wouldn't do to violate
the sacred commandments.

120
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,470
-Not that again.

121
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,560
Well, anyway.

122
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,590
As for the other three,
leave them to me.

123
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,580
-Izumo.

124
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,570
-Yeah, I know.

125
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,580
-All right.

126
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,470
-Water style, syrup trap!

127
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,530
-Yeah!

128
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,480
-That do the trick?

129
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,550
-I presume your plan
was to distract me

130
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,500
with that eye-grabbing
aerial display

131
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,420
while all the time your
friend was launching a ground

132
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,480
attack at my feet with
this strange liquid.

133
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:56,590
However-- it didn't
quite come off.

134
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,410
So much wasted effort.

135
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,442
-Oh yeah?

136
00:11:06,221 --> 00:11:07,301
-What the--

137
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:08,531
-Right.

138
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,470
-What a surprise.

139
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,500
-That's it, Izumo.

140
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:26,501
Gotcha!

141
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,391
-Kotetsu!

142
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,480
Oh no--

143
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,600
-They're giving me
a run for my money.

144
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,600
-Sounds like Kakuzu is
just about worn out.

145
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,620
I better cut this
short and step in.

146
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,570
Otherwise I'll have
to keep hearing

147
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,570
about how my rituals
go on forever.

148
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,471
Nighty-night.

149
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,550
-Asuma!

150
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,520
Behind you!

151
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,461
-Nighty-night.

152
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,630
-Asuma!

153
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,630
Behind you!

154
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
-How many times you think
I'll fall for that--

155
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,500
-You fool!

156
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,480
It's the same trap again!

157
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,341
-Ugh--

158
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,510
-Dammit--

159
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,510
-Damn!

160
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,540
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): So
in the end-- in the end

161
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:53,460
you decided to do it
after all, didn't you?

162
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,530
To sacrifice yourself for
the sake of your comrades.

163
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,560
-I don't get it.

164
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,460
What's wrong with my strategy?

165
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,450
If I can just tie up one of the
enemy with my shadow stitching

166
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,470
we'll reduce their fighting
strength by half, right?

167
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,430
But we know from
prior experience

168
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,410
if I try and use it
against an opponent who's

169
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,450
far away I can mess up.

170
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,560
Clearly shadow stitching becomes
less effective at long range.

171
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:28,550
But in close combat its
binding force is powerful.

172
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,470
So the success rate would
increase exponentially.

173
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,570
That's the key to the strategy.

174
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,410
-So it'll be a
two-tiered formation.

175
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,570
You and the vanguard engaging
the enemy with your shadow

176
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,490
stitching, with me
acting as your backup.

177
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,580
-Exactly.

178
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,600
With me in the front lines tying
up the enemy, we can't lose.

179
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,420
-Actually, I think it's a
brilliant strategy, Shikamaru,

180
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,560
and I like it very much.

181
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,420
-Then why not try it?

182
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,590
-For that very reason.

183
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,440
Our team is an excellent one.

184
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,530
Not that much different
from other four-man squads

185
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,590
in terms of fighting
power, but we

186
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,430
have something most
other teams don't have.

187
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,610
A strategist.

188
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,580
That's you, Shikamaru.

189
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:17,510
A good strategist has to be able
to clearly assess the situation

190
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,510
moment by moment in
order to direct his team.

191
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,550
The skills you possess are best
deployed in the rear guard,

192
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,490
not in the thick of battle.

193
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,570
Putting you at risk
in the front lines

194
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,500
only increases the chances of
our failing in the mission.

195
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,570
-You're forgetting.

196
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,440
I understand the pain of
losing a comrade too, you know.

197
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,530
I know what it feels like.

198
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,620
I'm aware of the risk.

199
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,520
But what does it matter?

200
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,610
You admit it's
the best strategy.

201
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,430
It's the best way for me
to protect my comrades

202
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,620
so I don't have
to lose any more.

203
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,630
-If by protecting your comrades
you're referring to us,

204
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,580
the team, then you haven't
understood anything.

205
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,460
The things we're
protecting, the reason

206
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,540
we're fighting--
you still don't see

207
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,450
the true purpose of all of this.

208
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,620
And until you do
there's no way I

209
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,540
can put you on the
front line, Shikamaru.

210
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,530
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
It's all my fault.

211
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,530
If I'd only come up with a
better strategy none of this

212
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,420
would have--

213
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,410
-Don't you guys get it?

214
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,420
It's the only move we've got!

215
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,630
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): I've
never seen Asuma like this.

216
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,430
-To penetrate the
enemy's line sometimes

217
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,550
you have to risk a bold move.

218
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,420
-Climbing silver.

219
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,580
It's not a role that suits you.

220
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,490
-I'm not gonna be the
sacrificial piece.

221
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,430
I've got you with me, after all.

222
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,520
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Dammit!

223
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,590
It's my fault.

224
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,590
My fault!

225
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,430
If I hadn't been
such an idiot this

226
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,510
wouldn't be happening to Asuma!

227
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,570
-Well?

228
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,550
Does it hurt?

229
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,430
Hm?

230
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,480
How about now?

231
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,420
Finally.

232
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,460
Now I can finally savor it.

233
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,590
Savor the pain
caused by your death!

234
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,410
KOTETSU (VOICEOVER): Captain.

235
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,490
IZUMO (VOICEOVER): Damn.

236
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,691
-The end.

237
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,490
-No!

238
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,391
No!

239
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,550
KURENAI (VOICEOVER): Asuma--

240
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,450
-Yes.

241
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,490
That's the stuff.

242
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,410
-No!

243
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,410
No!

244
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,152
Asuma!

245
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,460
[music playing]

246
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,440
-Don't bother trying to heal me.

247
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,490
I wouldn't make it anyway.

248
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,580
I can feel it.

249
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,450
The things the Third
Hokage did to protect

250
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,550
the village-- I think
I finally understand.

251
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:15,510
I was always slow
figuring things out.

252
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,580
You know, Choji, Shikamaru,
I've got something

253
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,410
I have to tell the three of you.

254
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,088
-Next time, Last Words.
