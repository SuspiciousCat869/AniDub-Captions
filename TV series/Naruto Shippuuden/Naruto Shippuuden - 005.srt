The sand he used to crush

powerful than ordinary
sand from the desert.

112
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:27,474
According to our
information, he always

113
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,244
carries around a fixed
amount of it with him,

114
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,981
so it stands to reason
that sand is different.

Infused with a large
amount of chakra, probably.

116

That's his go-to
for quick defense

and the source of all his
lightning fast attacks.

How long do you expect

Judging by the

00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,598
the enemy our lord
is fighting against

150
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:08,501
is most likely a
member of the Akatsuki.

BAKI: Gaara's resorted to his
ultimate defense up there.

155
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,718
I think it's safe to
assume this enemy he's

facing is a serious threat.

We can't rule out the
possibility of Gaara

losing control.

You don't have to
worry about that.

00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:52,705
You're a weapon of terror.

169
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,615
Seriously, leaving us and
joining the regular troops

170
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,351
is not gonna be an easy thing.

171
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:09,789
They're full of jonin who
think pretty poorly of you.

172
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,458
And most of the villagers,
they're as terrified of you

173
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:13,426
as they've always been.

174
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,331
-I know that.

175
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,636
I've always known.

176
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,439
But doing nothing at all
will almost certainly

177
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,842
bring even greater pain.

178
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,544
I know what I must do.

179
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:38,117
I must clear my own path.

180
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,354
And perhaps then,
the day'll come.

181
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:51,597
The day will come when
I can be like him.

182
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:54,901
I want to be part
of this village,

183
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:58,471
so I'm aiming for
the title of Kazekage

184
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:02,108
as a shinobi of the Sand.

185
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:05,078
-Gaara.

186
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:09,182
-I will work hard and connect
to the people of this village.

187
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:17,724
Watching Naruto Uzumaki
has brought me clarity.

188
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:22,929
Until I met him,
my ties to others

189
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,498
brought only pain and sorrow.

190
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:33,773
But he was always pushing
me to redefine those ties.

191
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:37,176
I think I finally understand.

192
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:43,983
The suffering and sadness
of life, the joy-- these

193
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:47,186
are feelings that can be
shared with those around me.

194
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,332
It was Uzumaki.

195
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,201
He's the whole reason
my eyes have opened.

196
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:06,139
When we fought, we connected.

197
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:10,643
He's known the same pain
I have, and he taught me

198
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:15,681
that I can change the
path my life will follow.

199
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:19,585
One day, Kankuro, I'd like
to become something precious

200
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,053
to others too.

201
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:27,927
Not just to be viewed
as some hideous weapon--

202
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,296

Third Training Ground.

327
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:04,884
Day one was about snatching
bells away from our sensei.

328
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,151
Oh wow, look at me.

329
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:07,419
I was so cute!

330
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:08,988
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Those who abandon

331
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:12,591
their friends are
worse than scum.

332
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:15,628
SAKURA: But it turned out the
endgame wasn't bells at all.

333
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:17,796
It was teamwork, the
most important skill

334
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,999
for every shinobi to master.

335
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:22,735
Squad 7 passed
Kakashi-sensei's test,

336
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:25,738
taking its first step down
the path of the ninja.

337
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,440
Fun fact-- here's
Kakashi back in the day.

338
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:30,142
And here he is now.

339
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,710
Hasn't changed much, has he?

340
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,713
Just his reading material--
"Make Out Tactics"

341
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,583
has replaced "Make
Out Paradise."
