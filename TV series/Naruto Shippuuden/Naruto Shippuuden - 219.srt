1
00:00:17,053 --> 00:00:19,258
{\an1}<i>Boss, wait! </i>

2
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,861
{\an1}<i>No, no, no!</i>
<i>You gotta stop!</i>

3
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:23,864
{\an1}Huh?

4
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,001
{\an1}What's wrong? I was
just getting started!

5
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,804
It's terrible!

6
00:00:28,838 --> 00:00:35,548
{\an4}I just got the word that
Lord Danzo has died!
That means he's not the
Sixth Hokage anymore!

7
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:37,351
{\an1}Come on! You've
gotta be kidding me!

8
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:43,295
{\an4}I've been preparing
and studying Lord Danzo's
face so much, I can even
see him in my dreams!

9
00:00:44,396 --> 00:00:47,433
{\an1}Damn it! What the
heck?!

10
00:00:50,437 --> 00:00:55,212
{\an1}So, who's gonna be the
next Hokage?! Can you
tell me that?!

11
00:00:56,447 --> 00:01:02,991
{\an4}<i>She originally worked for</i>
<i>Orochimaru before she</i>
<i>joined up with Sasuke as a</i>
<i>shinobi with the Akatsuki.</i>

12
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,529
If that's the case,
she must have a lot
of intel.

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,570
Hey! Be nice, now!

14
00:01:11,603 --> 00:01:17,112
{\an1}Also, from what she tells
me, she was there when
Sasuke and Danzo battled.

15
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:20,050
So, you actually
witnessed them fighting?

16
00:01:20,084 --> 00:01:22,921
{\an1}Is he really
interrogating me
right here?!

17
00:01:22,954 --> 00:01:28,096
{\an5}Okay, we'll hold her
at the Intel Division.
We'll get everything
she knows.

18
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,431
Take her away.

19
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:30,332
{\an1}Sir.

20
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:35,974
{\an1}Hey! Stop! I'm not
going to try to escape!

21
00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:39,313
{\an1}Let go of me,
already!

22
00:01:43,518 --> 00:01:46,189
I'm thirsty! Get me
something to drink!

23
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:48,559
{\an1}<i>Oh, by the</i>
<i>way...</i>

24
00:01:48,593 --> 00:01:51,197
{\an1}How's Lady Tsunade
doing?

25
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:53,567
She's still
unconscious.

26
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:54,936
{\an1}Oh, I see.

27
00:01:56,172 --> 00:01:59,109
{\an1}Well, if you'll excuse
me, I need to go report
to the elders.

28
00:02:00,678 --> 00:02:02,580
Kakashi.

29
00:02:02,615 --> 00:02:06,921
{\an7}The Leaf's chain of
command is all in
shambles right now.

30
00:02:06,954 --> 00:02:09,926
{\an7}Someone has to restore
order as soon as
possible.

31
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,597
{\an1}Yes, I know that.

32
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:05,202
{\an1}"Kakashi Hatake, the
Hokage."

33
00:04:05,236 --> 00:04:07,305
{\an1}Sasuke did that?

34
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,810
{\an1}That's...
unbelievable.

35
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,726
[whining]

36
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:24,764
{\an1}That's why I want you
guys to let me handle
Sasuke.

37
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:31,208
{\an4}You want to fight Sasuke
alone?! Do you honestly
think we'd all go along with
something like that?!

38
00:04:32,277 --> 00:04:37,150
{\an5}Like TenTen says,
Naruto, we can't always
let you do what you want
all by yourself.

39
00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:41,224
The reason is because
this is a big problem
for the whole village.

40
00:04:41,257 --> 00:04:43,159
Look, I'm not
being selfish!

41
00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:46,865
{\an1}I know you swore you'd
go into full details when
we got back, but--

42
00:04:46,898 --> 00:04:48,635
{\an1}I never thought you
would say this!

43
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:53,575
{\an4}All of us have made up
our minds and resolved to
eliminate Sasuke!  You can't
do this alone!

44
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:58,483
{\an7}Listen, Naruto... I
hope you're not just
saying that you're going
to take down Sasuke...

45
00:04:58,517 --> 00:05:01,421
{\an7}... when you're actually
planning to protect him.

46
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:05,628
{\an1}I'm not. Trust me, I
have no intention of
protecting Sasuke.

47
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:13,305
{\an5}Rasengan!
Chidori!

48
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:20,350
{\an1}<i>Sasuke must have been</i>
<i>greatly weakened... </i>

49
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:24,222
{\an1}...by fighting at the
Five Kage Summit and
against Danzo.

50
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:26,325
{\an1}Why not take him down
right then?

51
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:30,599
Madara Uchiha was
there, so it wouldn't have
gone that easily if we tried.

52
00:05:30,632 --> 00:05:31,500
And besides...

53
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:33,236
{\an1}<i>That's no excuse...! </i>

54
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:35,539
{\an1}You shouldn't have let
him get away like that!

55
00:05:35,573 --> 00:05:41,683
{\an4}C'mon, Naruto! You're
strong, aren't you? You're
the village hero that took
down Pain, remember?!

56
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,951
Hero...?

57
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:46,323
Yeah! You could've taken
Sasuke down like you did
with Pain!

58
00:05:46,356 --> 00:05:47,825
That's not true.

59
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:48,559
{\an3}Why?

60
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,704
{\an7}You can't beat Sasuke
just by being strong.
'Cause now I know...

61
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,845
{\an1}<i>Inside of</i>
<i>him is...</i>

62
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:06,386
{\an1}<i>What is it,</i>
<i>Naruto?</i>

63
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,422
{\an1}What did you
find out?

64
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,430
No one should take on
Sasuke. Not with the
way he is now.

65
00:06:12,463 --> 00:06:13,732
{\an1}Just what do
you mean?

66
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,572
{\an1}That I'm the only one
who can fight him. And
that's all I can say.

67
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:21,409
{\an1}Yeah, great, thanks!
That tells us nothing!

68
00:06:21,443 --> 00:06:24,614
{\an1}You have to explain!
What happened?!

69
00:06:24,648 --> 00:06:27,318
{\an1}I'll tell you everything
when I can. I promise.

70
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:30,891
{\an1}There you go again,
giving us the runaround!
Damn it.

71
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:34,563
{\an7}<i>Naruto.</i>

72
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:38,469
{\an1}So, Sasuke?

73
00:06:41,105 --> 00:06:43,108
{\an1}How about it?

74
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:45,580
{\an1}Can you tell me what
it is I'm thinking
right now?

75
00:06:46,748 --> 00:06:47,516
{\an1}Can you...

76
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:49,319
{\an1}Read my mind?

77
00:06:50,987 --> 00:06:52,022
{\an1}<i>And can you...</i>

78
00:06:52,056 --> 00:06:57,364
{\an1}... understand that if you
and I fight each other...

79
00:06:57,397 --> 00:06:58,700
{\an1}... we'll both die.

80
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,608
{\an7}<i>Naruto, what are</i>
<i>you hiding?</i>

81
00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:05,711
{\an1}Well...

82
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:08,749
{\an1}Just leave all this to
me. Trust me, guys.

83
00:07:08,782 --> 00:07:10,584
{\an1}Hey, wait a minute,
you can't just leave!

84
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,053
{\an1}Naruto.

85
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:13,589
Hey! Naruto!

86
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:23,137
{\an1}<i>Now even Danzo...</i>

87
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,676
What a shame. The
more gifted they are,
the sooner they pass.

88
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:32,752
{\an7}We must convene a council
meeting right away to
determine the next
Hokage.

89
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:36,992
{\an5}The forming of the
allied Shinobi Force
will be delayed if
there's no Hokage.

90
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:41,832
{\an7}Well, then it can't be
helped. We'll recommend
you for the position.

91
00:07:41,866 --> 00:07:45,939
{\an7}Especially since our ally
the Sand has recommended
you.

92
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:46,706
{\an1}I am prepared.

93
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:50,046
{\an1}That didn't take much
convincing...

94
00:07:51,581 --> 00:07:55,118
{\an1}Of course, it is a bit
out of character for me
to be Hokage.

95
00:07:57,856 --> 00:08:02,030
{\an1}It'll be fine... I'll
go request a conference
with the Feudal Lords.

96
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:05,435
{\an1}Return home and prepare
until you're called.

97
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,773
{\an1}There really isn't
anything for me to
prepare for.

98
00:08:09,675 --> 00:08:11,110
Kakashi.

99
00:08:11,143 --> 00:08:14,749
{\an1}Let me just say one thing
to the next Hokage.

100
00:08:14,782 --> 00:08:19,189
Danzo was ambitious, but
all he did was for the
sake of this Village.

101
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,630
{\an7}Hiruzen in the light and
Danzo in the dark.

102
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:27,102
{\an7}Everything in the Hidden
Leaf went most smoothly
back then.

103
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:29,505
{\an1}Is that meant to be an
excuse?

104
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:31,575
{\an1}Only advice.

105
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:33,778
Don't take on
everything by
yourself.

106
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:37,885
You would do well to
find a confidant to
stand beside you.

107
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:46,698
You and I are the only
ones remaining from the
old days, now.

108
00:08:47,298 --> 00:08:50,837
{\an1}There is no telling what
the fate of a shinobi
will be...

109
00:09:18,212 --> 00:09:21,217
{\an1}<i>Sensei, they say I'm</i>
<i>going to be the next</i>
<i>Hokage.</i>

110
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:23,687
Ah!

111
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:24,723
Kakashi!

112
00:09:24,756 --> 00:09:26,092
Well, ya got
home safe.

113
00:09:26,926 --> 00:09:28,161
But let's see
how you're doin'!

114
00:09:30,131 --> 00:09:32,334
Okay, you didn't injure
yourself out there,
did ya?

115
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:33,235
{\an1}No, I'm fine.

116
00:09:34,972 --> 00:09:38,177
{\an1}Well... It's been a
while, how 'bout a
rematch?!

117
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:41,314
{\an1}Why's that?

118
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,086
{\an1}Seriously!? You ask why?!

119
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,127
{\an5}How can you even say
that?! Because you and I
are rivals forever and
ever, that's why!

120
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,832
We've had over a
hundred matches up to
now!

121
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:54,400
Let's add one more!

122
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:55,770
{\an1}In that case...

123
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,305
Now... no Sharingan!

124
00:09:57,339 --> 00:09:59,977
{\an1}Rock, Paper, Scissors!

125
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,714
{\an1}No! Not that!

126
00:10:02,747 --> 00:10:04,650
{\an1}Not this time!

127
00:10:06,887 --> 00:10:09,290
Our challenge... will
be that!

128
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:14,966
{\an1}I've put a finish line up
there. And we'll race to
it!

129
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,836
{\an1}Guy, this isn't
the time for--

130
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:21,743
{\an4}Yes, I know. And that's
exactly why I want to have
a hot-blooded challenge
between us right now!

131
00:10:22,377 --> 00:10:25,015
{\an1}You'll accept it,
won't you, my rival?!

132
00:10:26,884 --> 00:10:29,923
{\an1}You're right. No
time like the
present.

133
00:10:30,857 --> 00:10:32,126
All right.
Let's do it.

134
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:40,438
{\an7}<i>And why is it that you</i>
<i>want to start way out at</i>
<i>the entrance to the</i>
<i>village, again...? </i>

135
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:43,310
Because I want to enjoy
this challenge...

136
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,713
...to the absolute
fullest.

137
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,150
Well, you ready?

138
00:10:48,183 --> 00:10:49,052
{\an1}Anytime you are.

139
00:10:54,092 --> 00:10:54,793
Go!

140
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,243
[yelling]

141
00:11:05,276 --> 00:11:07,045
[laughing]

142
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:12,453
Come on, buddy!
Here we go! Whoa,
Okay, okay!

143
00:11:12,486 --> 00:11:17,295

{\an1}Hm?

anyone's gonna be
satisfied with the
way things stand now.

Sasuke.

the way things stand,

{\an8}No doubt about it. It's
their rivalry contest.

182
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:44,519
{\an8}Guy-Sensei probably
challenged him to it! Of
all the times to do this.

183
00:13:44,552 --> 00:13:45,620
{\an1}You're wrong.

184
00:13:45,653 --> 00:13:48,758
{\an1}I think that's exactly
why he's doing this
right now.

you probably won't be
able to accept my
challenges anymore.

I wanted to put you to
the test one last time
before it became official.

207
00:15:32,317 --> 00:15:33,619
Thank you, Kakashi.

208
00:15:35,354 --> 00:15:41,765
{\an4}Thanks, but this isn't
the last time. We'll
always be rivals, and
that will never change!

it reassuring having you
there, and I hope you
always will be.

{\an4}I can't bring this

by myself, Guy. Are you
listening?!

let me measure your face!

{\an1}I'm gonna have to
make a mold, too.

I'm sorry...
what?!

219
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,519
{\an8}You know, it's for
the great stone faces!
Of the Hokage!

220
00:16:17,553 --> 00:16:20,957
{\an1}I need you to come with
me. This won't hurt a bit.

00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,530
Uh, hey! Hold
on a second!
W-what-- Hurt?!

222
00:16:24,564 --> 00:16:27,534
It seems to me it's
not easy being the
Hokage.

223
00:16:27,568 --> 00:16:28,969
{\an1}Yeah...

224
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:32,442
{\an8}Well, Lee... It looks
like I've been one-upped
by my eternal rival...

225
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:35,613
{\an1}But still!

226
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:38,884
{\an8}Yes! Now it is your
turn to pass him by,
Sensei.

227
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:43,258
{\an1}If Kakashi is the Hokage,
Then I will aim beyond
that!

228
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:47,231
{\an1}I will go far beyond the
Hokage, to the very apex
of human achievement!

229
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:51,904
{\an8}I wish you luck, Guy
Sensei!

{\an1}Thank you!

231
00:16:53,006 --> 00:16:56,311
{\an8}By the way, what is
beyond the Hokage,
anyway?

232
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,520
Uh... I don't know...

233
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:16,041
Good hair! You always
wear it like this?

234
00:17:16,074 --> 00:17:17,544
Uh, well,
sometimes--

235
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:19,915
{\an1}The headband should be at
an angle.

236
00:17:19,947 --> 00:17:21,551
{\an1}It doesn't have to be
exact, I mean--

237
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:25,523
{\an4}You're funny. People
tell ya that? Once it's
carved, it's extremely
hard to change.

238
00:17:25,557 --> 00:17:26,792
No kidding.

239
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:29,429
{\an1}Well, that's all I
need. Unless, of course,
I missed something.

00:17:29,463 --> 00:17:30,731
Nope, didn't
miss a thing!

ready to make the mold.

{\an1}Oh, yeah!
Good stuff.

245
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:45,587
{\an4}You see, what we do is
paint this on your head in
thin layers in order to make
a mold of your face!

256
00:18:28,886 --> 00:18:34,461
{\an1}Yeah, right. I'm old
enough to retire and have
my son take over for me.

{\an1}Yes! He's a very

what number Hokage do I

Number Six but died
before he formally
assumed the office.

crushing me.

290
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,281
{\an5}Send word to the other
villages! Tsunade, Hokage
of the Hidden Leaf, is
alive and well!

291
00:20:37,315 --> 00:20:40,787
{\an1}Report this to the feudal
lords of the other lands,
too.

292
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:43,959
{\an1}We should also let the
people of our village
know about this.

293
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,130
Then I will leave
that job to you.

294
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:48,298
{\an1}So, um...

295
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,236
{\an1}Uh...

296
00:20:50,268 --> 00:20:52,839
{\an1}Is it all right if I go
home?

297
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:58,280
{\an1}Well, since you're
free, why don't we
get some sushi?

298
00:20:58,313 --> 00:21:00,751
{\an1}We can see who can eat
the most!

299
00:21:00,785 --> 00:21:01,719
Why not?

300
00:21:05,324 --> 00:21:09,665
{\an1}<i>Boss, wait! No, no, no!</i>
<i>You gotta stop!</i>

301
00:21:09,698 --> 00:21:11,134
Huh??

302
00:21:11,168 --> 00:21:13,704
{\an1}What is it?

303
00:21:13,938 --> 00:21:18,011
{\an1}Lady Tsunade has been
reinstated as the Hokage.

304
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:22,885
What?! You gotta be
kidding me! I wasted
all that time again?!

305
00:22:56,995 --> 00:23:03,004
{\an1}It was indeed I who
summoned you... Er...
Who are you again?

306
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:06,142
<i>C'mon, could you</i>
<i>remember my name</i>
<i>already?! </i>

307
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:10,582
{\an1}<i>Oh, yes, that's right,</i>
<i>that's right! I've had</i>
<i>a prophecy about you.</i>

308
00:23:10,615 --> 00:23:13,087
{\an1}<i>Now, listen</i>
<i>carefully...</i>

309
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:19,596
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: Prophecy of</i>
<i>the Great Lord Elder. </i>

310
00:23:20,264 --> 00:23:22,201
<i>It's all clear</i>
<i>to me now.</i>
