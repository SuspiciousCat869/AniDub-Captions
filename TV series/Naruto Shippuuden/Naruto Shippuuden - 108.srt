inside of the Three‐Tails?

Are you feeling as good as I am?

‐Yeah.

8
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,711
I feel like a whole new person.

9
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:47,380
‐All the fatigue
and pain is gone.

10
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:52,085
And as a matter of fact, I
feel more powerful than ever!

11
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:53,453
‐Terrific.

12
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:56,456
But all I care about is getting
Yukimaru back from the Leaf.

‐[laughs]

14
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:00,293
You worry too much, Four‐Eyes.

15
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:03,036
‐Right now, I feel like
I could take on anyone.

16
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:06,106
‐Anyone at all, even Guren!

17
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:09,142
KUBOTA (VOICEOVER): Hm,
I'm not so sure about that.

18
00:01:09,175 --> 00:01:10,544
But you never know.

19
00:01:14,347 --> 00:01:15,248
‐What?

20
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:17,117
Could this really be true?

21
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,184
‐Well, yes.

22
00:01:18,218 --> 00:01:21,254
According to Yukimaru,
he really believes

23
00:01:21,287 --> 00:01:23,323
that Guren woman is still alive.

24
00:01:23,356 --> 00:01:25,526
‐And he says Naruto
and she ended up

25
00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:27,994
being swallowed by
the Three‐Tails.

26
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:29,963
‐Well, stranger
things have happened.

27
00:01:29,996 --> 00:01:32,899
It would explain why
we haven't found them.

28
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:37,403
But if it's true, what makes
you think Guren survived?

29
00:01:37,437 --> 00:01:40,173
‐Guren made this crystal
especially for me.

30
00:01:40,206 --> 00:01:41,875
If anything would
have happened to her,

31
00:01:41,908 --> 00:01:44,144
it would have shattered.

32
00:01:44,177 --> 00:01:45,679
‐I see.

33
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:48,882
‐But even if that proves that
Guren's still in one piece,

34
00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:52,218
it doesn't indicate whether
Naruto's all right as well.

35
00:01:52,252 --> 00:01:53,286
‐True.

36
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,420
There is no way of
knowing what it's

37
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:56,590
like inside that
beast's stomach.

38
00:01:56,623 --> 00:01:58,859
‐And anyway, if he
is all right, he's

39
00:01:58,892 --> 00:02:01,535
stuck with that woman
and her Crystal Style.

40
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:03,336
Chances are, they've
already fought it out

41
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:05,506
and settled things
one way or the other.

42
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:07,207
‐Taking her own by himself?

43
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,274
‐Stop.

44
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:10,210
Let's just work
on the assumption

45
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:14,414
that Naruto is fine, that
we have to find the beast.

46
00:02:14,447 --> 00:02:15,749
‐All right.

47
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:17,183
I'll look for it.

48
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,585
‐The Three‐Tails?

49
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:20,420
You can find it?

50
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:21,622
‐Yeah.

51
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:24,625
I'm not sure how exactly,
but I‐‐ I can feel it.

52
00:02:24,658 --> 00:02:28,428
‐OK, but even if we do find
that thing, what do we do then?

53
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:31,464
‐Then my team and I will try
one more time to seal it.

54
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:33,867
‐And we'll rescue Naruto
while you're doing that.

55
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,903
And in case the Three‐Tails
starts acting up,

56
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:39,372
Yamato, we'll send
Shino with you.

57
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:42,976
He'll also come in handy if
we find Guren with Naruto.

58
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:45,345
Sai, you're on
airborne surveillance.

secure the perimeter.

171
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:12,278
‐I can throw things, too!

172
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:15,616
‐No, you don't!

173
00:09:20,787 --> 00:09:22,689
‐What happened to them?

174
00:09:22,723 --> 00:09:24,157
‐Come out, come out!

175
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,159
Smoke Dragon!

176
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:26,660
‐Huh?

177
00:09:30,597 --> 00:09:32,032
[growls]

178
00:09:39,906 --> 00:09:40,874
‐Huh?

179
00:09:40,907 --> 00:09:42,242
‐What is it?

180
00:09:42,275 --> 00:09:45,512
‐They're here, right below us.

181
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:47,548
‐All right, Sealing
Team, get ready.

182
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:48,682
‐Wait.

183
00:09:48,715 --> 00:09:50,684
They're trapped inside.

184
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:53,520
Guren and Naruto are
trying to find a way out.

185
00:09:53,554 --> 00:09:54,588
‐A way out?

186
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:56,623
‐If we can make a
hole from the outside,

187
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:58,559
that can be their
way to get out.

188
00:09:58,592 --> 00:10:00,661
‐What's the boy talking about?

189
00:10:00,694 --> 00:10:02,503
‐I suggest we
investigate and find out

190
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,304
exactly what's down there.

191
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,405
‐Camellias!

192
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,874
I will need a lot of
camellias, quickly!

193
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:08,374
‐Camellias?

194
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,981
‐So why did you save me?

195
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,517
‐Well, I was thinking
the same thing.

196
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,619
Why the heck did you save me?

197
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,521
‐For one simple reason.

198
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:22,288
I need you to get out of here.

199
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,489
‐Oh, really?

200
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:24,558
So you need me.

201
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,359
You admit it.

202
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,829
Uh, how's that wound?

203
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:31,197
‐Ugh, don't touch me!

204
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,300
Once we're out of here, you
and I will still be enemies.

205
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,736
‐Yeah, whatever.

206
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,171
But I'm not letting
you have Yukimaru.

207
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,807
‐Why do you care so
much about him anyway?

208
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:44,210
‐It's like I said before,
Orochimaru's evil.

209
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,312
Whatever reasons
you've given yourself

210
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,481
for remaining loyal
to him, you've

211
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:53,987
got to know he's just using
you, like he's using him.

212
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,988
‐Used who?

213
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,022
‐Forget it!

214
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,758
The point is that
Yukimaru definitely

215
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:01,334
doesn't belong with you
and your boss, Orochimaru.

216
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:04,304
Well, since my clones
are out of commission,

217
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:06,640
I guess I better do some
reconnaissance on my own.

218
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:18,251
It's a long way down, but
it's the only way out.

219
00:11:18,284 --> 00:11:19,152
Here goes nothing.

220
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:25,759
Ugh, huh.

221
00:11:29,696 --> 00:11:30,664
A fog?

222
00:11:30,697 --> 00:11:34,034
Oh, no.

223
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:35,802
Not them again.

224
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:37,403
Huh?

225
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:37,904
Wait!

226
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:41,742
Hold it!

227
00:11:41,775 --> 00:11:42,576
Who are you?

228
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:44,545
What are you doing down here?

229
00:11:47,548 --> 00:11:48,014
Impossible.

230
00:11:50,817 --> 00:11:51,885
Sasuke?

231
00:11:51,918 --> 00:11:56,056
What the hell are you
doing in this place?

232
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:56,557
Ugh!

233
00:12:08,942 --> 00:12:11,377
Huh?

234
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:13,847
Knock it off, Sasuke!

235
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,450
Listen, there's something
you need to know!

236
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:18,985
What are you doing?

237
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,955
Sasuke!

238
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:22,455
‐Uh!

239
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:35,468
That Three‐Tails' fog again.

240
00:12:35,502 --> 00:12:36,236
I see.

241
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:42,943
GUREN (VOICEOVER):
This fog senses

242
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:45,478
the weakness in the hearts
of anyone caught in it

243
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:47,748
and manifests them as illusions.

244
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:53,253
If I go down there,
I'll have to face mine.

245
00:12:53,286 --> 00:12:54,621
NARUTO: Sasuke!

246
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:58,091
Stop it!

247
00:12:58,124 --> 00:12:58,592
‐Um!

248
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:06,006
[groans]

249
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:14,380
Uh.

250
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,758
It's you.

251
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:33,667
I know that I can't atone for
what I've done, but forgive me.

252
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,636
There's nothing I can
do to make amends.

253
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:38,839
But I promise you, I will
protect your child always,

254
00:13:38,872 --> 00:13:40,641
even at the cost of my own life.

255
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,551
[sobs]

256
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:57,023
‐Aagh!

257
00:13:57,057 --> 00:14:00,026
Ugh!

258
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,703
Sasuke, why are we fighting?

259
00:14:02,736 --> 00:14:05,238
Why have you turned your
back on the one place

260
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:07,508
in the world where you belong?

261
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:10,977
Why, Sasuke?

262
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:12,713
Ugh.

263
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:13,980
Let go of me.

264
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:16,116
Let go!

265
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:16,950
Ah!

266
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:18,418
‐Get a hold of yourself!

267
00:14:18,451 --> 00:14:21,988
What you've been
fighting is an illusion.

268
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:22,488
‐Uh.

269
00:14:31,197 --> 00:14:33,099
Ugh!

270
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:36,236
You just saved my life.

271
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:38,839
‐Was it Sasuke Uchiha?

272
00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:40,641
‐Yeah.

273
00:14:40,674 --> 00:14:43,043
Hold on, how come
you know Sasuke?

274
00:14:43,076 --> 00:14:45,779
‐I have seen him
with Lord Orochimaru.

275
00:14:45,812 --> 00:14:47,080
He frightens me.

276
00:14:47,113 --> 00:14:47,981
‐You've seen him?

277
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:49,382
Tell me, is he safe?

278
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:50,717
Is he all right?

279
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:51,885
‐I think so.

280
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:53,920
Why are you so interested?

281
00:14:53,954 --> 00:14:55,288
‐Why am I interested?

282
00:14:55,321 --> 00:14:57,457
Because Sasuke's
always been one of us.

283
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,226
It's important that I find
him so I can tell him, make

284
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:04,437
him see that we're his home,
the place where he belongs!

285
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,572
‐Wait a minute.

286
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:08,208
Are you really going to
try to take Sasuke back?

287
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,343
‐Of course, I am!

288
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:15,985
‐But...

289
00:15:15,985 --> 00:15:18,466
Sasuke Uchiha?

290
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:20,486
GUREN (VOICEOVER): Is
he out of his mind?

291
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:24,324
This boy really thinks
he can rescue Sasuke?

292
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:27,460
Uh, of all the‐‐

293
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,195
‐[giggles]

294
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:29,730
‐What?

295
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:30,296
What is it?

296
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,364
What's so funny?

297
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,333
‐Oh, Naruto, you're
an even bigger fool

298
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,334
than I thought you were.

299
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,769
‐Hey, where did that come from?

300
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,905
‐I could die laughing‐‐
oh, uh, literally.

301
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:39,472
‐Take it easy.

302
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:40,240
You OK?

303
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:52,252
‐That must be it, the
dimensional barrier Yukimaru

304
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,086
was talking about.

305
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:59,425
If we can punch a hole in it,
we might give Naruto a way out.

306
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:05,506
Here goes.

307
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,042
Lightning Blade!

308
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:15,782
‐The fog is starting to lift.

309
00:16:15,816 --> 00:16:19,052
It's like it's
leaking out somewhere.

310
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:20,386
Where did they come from?

311
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,256
‐They've got us surrounded.

312
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:24,691
‐Give me a break!

313
00:16:24,725 --> 00:16:25,659
Not again!

314
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:28,161
Persistent, I'll give them that.

315
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:30,864
‐One more time.

316
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:32,365
Ugh!

317
00:16:32,398 --> 00:16:33,867
Come on home, Naruto.

318
00:16:41,842 --> 00:16:44,310
Ready?

319
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:45,311
‐Do it now!

320
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:05,672
‐Naruto, there is something
I need to tell you.

321
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:08,509
‐Right now is not
exactly the best time.

322
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:11,377
‐I told you that Yukimaru's
mother died, right?

323
00:17:11,411 --> 00:17:12,646
‐Yeah.

324
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:15,081
‐I was the one who killed her.

325
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:15,716
‐Huh?

326
00:17:15,749 --> 00:17:17,350
What did you say?

327
00:17:17,383 --> 00:17:19,720
‐At that time,
Lord Orochimaru was

328
00:17:19,753 --> 00:17:21,988
intent on creating
the Sound Village.

329
00:17:22,022 --> 00:17:25,191
And I was ordered to
attack Yukimaru's village.

330
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:27,928
But I had exhausted my powers.

331
00:17:27,961 --> 00:17:28,829
I collapsed.

332
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:45,378
That woman, I was her enemy,
but she saved my life.

333
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:49,449
Go now.

334
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:50,651
Get out while you can.

335
00:18:06,907 --> 00:18:11,244
‐You weren't going to
betray me, were you, Guren?

336
00:18:11,277 --> 00:18:15,882
‐You see, I
couldn't‐‐ I couldn't.

337
00:18:18,552 --> 00:18:21,555
Back then, all I wanted was
to please Lord Orochimaru.

338
00:18:21,588 --> 00:18:23,301
And so I‐‐

339
00:18:35,891 --> 00:18:37,431
and I'd
almost succeeded

340
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:39,873
in forgetting all about
that terrible time.

341
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:43,810
Then I met Yukimaru and the
memories came flooding back.

342
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:47,047
‐That's why you protect him.

343
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,749
‐You were right about me.

344
00:18:48,782 --> 00:18:53,687
I've hurt Yukimaru in ways I can
never hope to make amends for.

345
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,023
I have no right to
be his protector.

346
00:18:57,057 --> 00:18:58,525
‐Guren.

347
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,060
‐It's too late for me.

348
00:19:00,093 --> 00:19:01,835
But I'll see that you
make it out of here,

349
00:19:01,868 --> 00:19:04,505
if it's the last thing I do!

350
00:19:04,538 --> 00:19:06,707
You have to escape and live.

351
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,974
Protect Yukimaru.

352
00:19:08,008 --> 00:19:10,711
‐I've got to say, that
sounds weird coming from you.

353
00:19:10,744 --> 00:19:14,515
But that just proves that
you're a different person now.

354
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:15,516
‐Naruto‐‐

355
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:16,983
[water flowing]

356
00:19:17,017 --> 00:19:17,483
Huh?

357
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,888
‐Camellias?

358
00:19:21,922 --> 00:19:25,391
[grass‐whistle music]

359
00:19:35,736 --> 00:19:37,504
‐Yukimaru.

360
00:19:37,538 --> 00:19:38,605
‐It's him.

361
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:41,975
He's trying to show us
the way out of here.

362
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:43,476
Watch out!

363
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,478
Agh!

364
00:19:45,512 --> 00:19:45,979
Ugh.

365
00:19:49,983 --> 00:19:50,450
‐Ugh.

366
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:55,922
‐OK, up you go!

367
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,366
Agh!

368
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,240
No way I was going
to leave you in here.

369
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,510
We're getting out, both of us.

370
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:10,010
Now!

371
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:19,352
Aah!

372
00:20:30,449 --> 00:20:33,567
[music playing]

373

KABUTO (VOICEOVER): If
things continue to go wrong

374
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:04,638
and those fools from
the Leaf actually

375
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:06,540
succeed in sealing
the Three‐Tails,

376
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:09,643
it could seriously
jeopardize Lord Orochimaru's

377
00:22:09,676 --> 00:22:11,444
whole strategy.

378
00:22:11,477 --> 00:22:14,314
I can't allow that to happen.

379
00:22:14,347 --> 00:22:18,184
If I ever had any pity for
Yukimaru, it's gone now.

380
00:22:18,218 --> 00:22:21,555
I will squeeze every ounce of
power of the boy if I have to

381
00:22:21,588 --> 00:22:24,324
and stop the Leaf shinobi.

382
00:22:24,357 --> 00:22:26,192
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time, "Counterattack

383
00:22:26,226 --> 00:22:27,928
of the Curse Mark."
