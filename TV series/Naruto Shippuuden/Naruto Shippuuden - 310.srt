294
00:17:05,326 --> 00:17:08,296
{\an1}Hello? Anyone? Is anyone here?!

295
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:12,200
{\an1}My lord! It is I, Tatewaki!

296
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:19,073
{\an1}So it's you. The one who's
destroyed so many of my puppets.

297
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:22,144
That's right. Just
who are you?

298
00:17:22,177 --> 00:17:25,080
{\an1}Let's just say,
the Akatsuki.

299
00:17:25,414 --> 00:17:27,449
Why'd you attack
this castle?

300
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:31,719
{\an1}That's not something you need to
know. In any event, I'm done
here.

301
00:17:32,454 --> 00:17:36,225
{\an1}I cannot let you leave like
this, not after everything
you've done!

302
00:17:36,492 --> 00:17:39,094
{\an1}You'll have to answer for your
actions!

303
00:17:39,328 --> 00:17:43,699
{\an1}Even if you could defeat me,
your master is already gone.

304
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:46,635
{\an1}That may be, but my duty to
him shall never end!

305
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:52,308
[Yelling]

306
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:01,117
Don't underestimate me!

307
00:18:01,518 --> 00:18:04,621
{\an1}You know, I just finished
up a job.

308
00:18:05,121 --> 00:18:07,557
{\an1}Then be quite and let me finish
this!

309
00:18:19,702 --> 00:18:21,804
{\an1}That's what you call
dodging, is it?

310
00:18:23,673 --> 00:18:29,879
{\an1}<i>Those tubes are just for show,</i>
<i>what really matters are the</i>
<i>needles inside.</i>

311
00:18:29,913 --> 00:18:36,253
{\an1}Ah, yes! I see that the poison
on the needles has started to
take effect.

312
00:18:36,654 --> 00:18:44,461
{\an1}<i>Soon you won't be able to move</i>
<i>at all. Even now, it's already</i>
<i>too late. You're done for.</i>

313
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:48,232
{\an1}Well, then...it's time to make
my final stand!

314
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:51,168
[Screaming]

315
00:18:54,572 --> 00:18:55,806
{\an1}<i>Princess Chiyo!</i>

316
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:56,907
<i>Lord Shu!</i>

317
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:57,741
<i>Naruto!</i>

318
00:18:58,776 --> 00:19:00,778
{\an1}<i>Huh? How come Princess Chiyo is</i>
<i>with you?</i>

319
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:03,314
{\an1}<i>Old Man Tatewaki asked</i>
<i>me to take care of her.</i>

320
00:19:03,347 --> 00:19:04,248
<i>Tatewaki?</i>

321
00:19:05,517 --> 00:19:08,486
{\an1}<i>Yeah! You should have seen him!</i>
<i>He's this super-strong samurai!</i>

322
00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:17,562
{\an1}Your interference is unwelcome.

323
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:20,398
It seems that the
mission went well.

324
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,269
{\an1}<i>That nation fell to</i>
<i>a larger one?</i>

325
00:19:24,636 --> 00:19:29,174
{\an1}That means there are going to be
more groups out there who will
want to use the Akatsuki.

326
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,742
{\an1}What about Naruto
and the others?

327
00:19:32,677 --> 00:19:36,248
{\an1}I shadowed them until they'd
passed beyond the territorial
borders.

328
00:19:55,601 --> 00:20:01,507
{\an4}After we parted, I brought them
both to Lord Shu's nation. His
people welcomed the princess as
one of their own.

329
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:06,512
{\an4}And now their moving around with
the other Feudal Lords so that
they can all stay safe from all
the fighting.

330
00:20:06,712 --> 00:20:08,247
{\an1}I see.

331
00:20:08,447 --> 00:20:10,549
{\an1}That's just what I
wanted to hear.

332
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:14,220
{\an3}Huh?

333
00:20:14,987 --> 00:20:16,455
{\an1}Now, move in! Capture
him at once!

334
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:17,823
Wait! Hold on!

335
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:24,531
{\an1}I wish I could've been there. I
wish that I could have seen the
both of them grow up.

336
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:29,703
{\an4}You were there for them back
when they needed you. And they
wouldn't like to see you like
this, anyway.

337
00:20:30,537 --> 00:20:32,472
{\an1}Yes, you're right.

338
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:38,978
{\an1}Thank you, now I have no
regrets.

339
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,548
Huh?

340
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:04,871
{\an1}He took things into
his own hands, huh?

341
00:21:05,405 --> 00:21:08,875
{\an1}That's right. In the end, he
was who he wanted to be.

342
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,978
He was a true samurai,
through and through.

343
00:21:12,846 --> 00:21:20,688
{\an4}I'm gonna stay true to my
convictions, too. That's a
promise, Old Man. And I never go
back on my word!

344
00:22:56,953 --> 00:23:02,760
