happened sixteen years ago,
when you were born.

{\an1}<i>What do you mean?</i>

you about the Nine Tails'
Jinchuriki before you.

{\an1}You were the Nine Tails'
Jinchuriki, Mom? Seriously?!

I was.

{\an1}Before I can tell you what
happened sixteen years ago,

83
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:24,037
I need to tell you
more about me.

84
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:29,208
{\an1}Back then, I was chosen to
be the second Jinchuriki
host of the Nine Tails.

85
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:35,079
{\an4}In fact, the only reason I
came to the Hidden Leaf
Village in the first place
was for that very purpose.

00:08:35,712 --> 00:08:37,579

<i>the Land of Eddies.</i>

But why?

88
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:44,851
{\an1}Why'd they choose you as a
Jinchuriki?! You were a
stranger from another land!

89
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:50,022
{\an1}Yes, I was. A stranger.
From a different Hidden Village.

90
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:52,657
{\an1}But it was also a
different time.

91
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,392
{\an1}Back then, the Land of Fire
and the Land of Eddies had
a close relationship.

92
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,295
{\an1}<i>They shared a deep bond.</i>

<i>Senju Clan and the shinobi of</i>
<i>the Eddy's Uzumaki Clan were</i>
<i>distant blood relatives.</i>

94
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:12,436
{\an4}<i>Full of shinobi brimming</i>
<i>with vitality, the Hidden</i>
<i>Eddy Village was also known</i>
<i>as the Village of Longevity.</i>

95
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:21,542
{\an1}<i>My clan excelled</i>
<i>at sealing jutsu.</i>
<i>It was their specialty.</i>

96
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:25,146
{\an1}<i>But they were also</i>
<i>a bit savage.</i>

97
00:09:27,613 --> 00:09:31,816
{\an4}<i>The Tetragram Seal on</i>
<i>your belly was based on a</i>
<i>jutsu that was originally</i>
<i>developed by our village.</i>

98
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:36,987
{\an1}I taught it to Minato,
your father, along with
several other sealing jutsu.

99
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:42,724
Naruto. that symbol
there, on the back
of your jacket.

100
00:09:43,758 --> 00:09:46,394
It's the crest of the
Hidden Eddy Village.

101
00:09:47,527 --> 00:09:52,398
{\an4}<i>Even today in the Hidden</i>
<i>Leaf Village, it's a</i>
<i>symbol of friendship and</i>
<i>camaraderie, isn't it?</i>

102
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,201
{\an1}I've never heard of the
Hidden Eddy Village.

103
00:10:00,404 --> 00:10:03,505
{\an1}That's 'cause it
doesn't actually exist
as a village any more.

104
00:10:04,673 --> 00:10:09,909
{\an1}<i>During the era of war and</i>
<i>unrest, our sealing jutsu</i>
<i>abilities were greatly feared,</i>

105
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,245
{\an1}<i>so we were targeted</i>
<i>and destroyed.</i>

106
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:17,315

<i>and they hid themselves</i>
<i>throughout the other lands.</i>

107
00:10:17,915 --> 00:10:21,084
{\an1}But I still don't get it.
So why were you chosen, mom?

108
00:10:22,584 --> 00:10:25,687
{\an1}I was born with very strong
chakra even for my village.

109
00:10:26,054 --> 00:10:29,423
{\an1}It's powerful enough to
suppress the vast might
of the Nine Tails.

110
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:35,160
Do you know
about the battle,

111
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:39,430
{\an1}between the First Hokage
Hashirama Senju and
Madara Uchiha?

112
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,130
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

113
00:10:42,664 --> 00:10:46,801
{\an1}The Jinchuriki before me
was the woman who became
the wife of the First Hokage.

114
00:10:49,502 --> 00:10:52,038
{\an1}<i>Her name was Mito Uzumaki.</i>

115
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:57,642
{\an1}<i>During that battle, to lend</i>
<i>strength to Lord Hashirama,</i>
<i>who had obtained Nine Tails,</i>

116
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:04,013
{\an1}<i>Lady Mito sealed the Nine Tails</i>
<i>inside herself with a Sealing</i>
<i>Jutsu and became its Jinchuriki.</i>

117
00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:09,717
{\an1}<i>And ever since that day,</i>
<i>the Leaf has possessed</i>
<i>the Nine Tails.</i>

118
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:14,619
{\an1}<i>When Lady Mito approached</i>
<i>the end of her life,</i>

119
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:19,957
{\an1}<i>I was brought to the Hidden</i>
<i>Leaf to become the next</i>
<i>vessel for the Nine Tails.</i>

120
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:23,892
{\an1}But they weren't even treating
you like you were a real person!

121
00:11:26,195 --> 00:11:30,998
{\an4}When I was brought to the
village, I wasn't told a
single thing about why I
was really there.

122
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:34,633
{\an1}<i>Of course, I was completely</i>
<i>shocked when I found out.</i>

123
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:38,937
{\an1}<i>Everything about it</i>
<i>was top secret.</i>

124
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:43,606
{\an1}<i>The only ones who knew</i>
<i>were Lord Third Hokage</i>
<i>and a few of the elders.</i>

125
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,708
{\an1}<i>Not even the Legendary</i>
<i>Sannin knew.</i>

126
00:11:49,478 --> 00:11:53,613
I was so lonely.
The responsibility
almost ruined me.

127
00:11:56,482 --> 00:12:00,284
But then Lady Mito, the
previous Jinchuriki,
summoned me.

128
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:03,353
{\an1}Please, come closer,
my dear.

129
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:25,901
We are alike,
you and I.

130
00:12:25,934 --> 00:12:29,004
I was brought here to
be the Nine Tails'
vessel, too.

131
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:33,106
I can only imagine the
shock you felt when
you learned of it.

132
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,875
How sad you
must have been.

133
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:37,109
How you've suffered.

134
00:12:39,711 --> 00:12:41,578
My dear, you can
tell me the truth;

135
00:12:41,612 --> 00:12:43,781
you don't have to hold
everything inside.

136
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:45,882
Yes.

137
00:12:50,385 --> 00:12:51,986
Listen closely.

138
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,622
{\an1}Neither of us could
escape our fate as the
Nine Tails' vessel.

139
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:56,955
However...

140
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,325
<i>There is something that</i>
<i>you must understand:</i>

141
00:13:00,758 --> 00:13:04,928
{\an1}<i>There is a way to find</i>
<i>happiness even if you must</i>
<i>live as a Jinchuriki.</i>

142
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,198
{\an1}And the first step is...

143
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:12,367
<i>...to fill ourselves...</i>

144
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:17,837
{\an1}The first step is...
to fill ourselves with love.

145
00:13:18,937 --> 00:13:23,107
{\an1}<i>Then, even if we had to live</i>
<i>as the  Nine Tails' Jinchuriki,</i>

146
00:13:23,774 --> 00:13:25,975
{\an1}<i>we could still find</i>
<i>a way to be happy.</i>

147
00:13:27,444 --> 00:13:29,211
That is what Lady
Mito taught me.

148
00:13:29,945 --> 00:13:33,713
{\an1}So you were actually happy
even though you were still
the Jinchuriki, Mom?

149
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:37,250
Mm-hmm!

150
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,620
[sniffs]

151
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:45,588
[sympathetic chuckle]

152
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:48,791
{\an1}Naruto, there's no need
for you to cry, is there?

153
00:13:48,825 --> 00:13:50,460
[chuckle]

154
00:13:51,326 --> 00:13:52,561
Hold on.

155
00:13:53,028 --> 00:13:54,962
What is it?

156
00:13:54,995 --> 00:13:59,199
{\an1}So what happened when Nine Tails
attacked the Hidden Leaf Village
sixteen years ago?

157
00:13:59,731 --> 00:14:05,436
{\an4}Dad told me that the entire
thing was all because of
that guy from the Akatsuki,
the one who wears the mask.

158
00:14:06,937 --> 00:14:10,339
{\an1}<i>How come you had</i>
<i>the Nine Tails, Mom?</i>
<i>I don't get it!</i>

159
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:14,075
{\an1}Your father left just a
few things out when he
talked to you, I suppose.

160
00:14:15,443 --> 00:14:16,810
But it wasn't his fault.

161
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:21,746
{\an1}You see, he keyed the sealing
jutsu to give me more time
with you than he got.

162
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,249
{\an1}And there was so much
going on back then, anyway.

163
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,251
However, he was right.

164
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,588
{\an1}When the Nine Tails attacked
the Hidden Leaf Village
sixteen years ago,

165
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,590
that masked man
from the Akatsuki
was behind it all.

166
00:14:34,622 --> 00:14:37,090
But right up until
the moment that the
attack happened,

167
00:14:37,124 --> 00:14:39,326
the Nine Tails was still
sealed inside of me.

168
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:41,227
{\an1}Then what happened?!

169
00:14:41,894 --> 00:14:44,062
It was that masked man.

170
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:47,898
I have no idea how he
discovered it, but he
knew the secret.

171
00:14:48,265 --> 00:14:49,233
{\an1}What secret?

172
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,437
{\an4}Somehow he found out about
the one and only time that
a Jinchuriki's Tailed
Beast seal weakens.

173
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,172
He timed it perfectly
and stole Nine Tails
from me.

174
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,408
{\an1}Hold on a second,
the one time that
the seal weakens?

175
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,009
{\an1}When does that happen?!
Please, tell me!

176
00:15:06,511 --> 00:15:07,578
In childbirth.

177
00:15:09,846 --> 00:15:14,483
{\an1}<i>During the nine months</i>
<i>between when a female Jinchuriki</i>
<i>gets pregnant and gives birth,</i>

178
00:15:15,518 --> 00:15:19,052
{\an1}<i>the seal holding back</i>
<i>the Tailed Beast</i>
<i>weakens proportionally.</i>

179
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:25,290
{\an1}<i>as the energy that's normally</i>
<i>used to maintain it is instead</i>
<i>diverted to the growing baby.</i>

180
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,159
So, then...

181
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,496
{\an1}It was on October tenth,
sixteen years ago.

182

<i>[female doctor]</i>
<i>Congratulations!</i>

183

00:15:44,436 --> 00:15:47,871
{\an1}Your due date works out to be,
let's see, October tenth!

185

{\an1}Oh, that's great!

186

What?! A baby?!

187

190

197
00:16:35,471 --> 00:16:37,872
It was the same way
with Lady Mito.

198
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:42,209
When she gave birth,
Nine Tails' seal almost
came completely undone.

about baby names, as well!

{\an1}Actually, I've
already decided!

{\an1}We're going to
call him Naruto.

like they say?

{\an1}Wow, so there's actually
something that scares you!
