1
00:00:17,502 --> 00:00:20,107
(sigh)

2
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:26,352
It sure has been
lonely around here.
Since the Fourth Great
Ninja War began.

3
00:00:38,978 --> 00:00:44,455
Sis! Sis! Check that
one out! Boy, that
thing's really trucking
along, isn't it?

4
00:00:47,294 --> 00:00:48,764
Whoa...

5
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,969
You ants sure
work hard!

6
00:00:51,002 --> 00:00:56,346
Your children must be
waiting for you with
hungry bellies. Hang
in there, guys!

7
00:00:57,582 --> 00:00:59,218
(horrified scream)

8
00:00:59,252 --> 00:01:01,790
Taku, no! What
are you doing?!

9
00:01:04,262 --> 00:01:07,167
Sorry, I couldn't
hold it any longer!

10
00:01:09,806 --> 00:01:12,144
(relieved sigh)

11
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:07,776
The elite ninja of
the Hidden Leaf have
formed an alliance
that's unprecedented

12
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:09,746
in the history of the
Five Great Nations to

13
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,923
fight this Fourth
Great Ninja War.
The question before
us now, as we worry

14
00:03:14,956 --> 00:03:18,063
about the well-being
of our families in
these turbulent times,

15
00:03:18,096 --> 00:03:22,505
is how we'll protect
the village while
those ninja are away.
But remember, we are

16
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:23,607
warriors, too!

17
00:03:25,043 --> 00:03:27,381
In the past, each
time there's been
a Great Ninja War,
our village has

18
00:03:27,414 --> 00:03:29,151
found itself
shorthanded.

19
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:34,529
And as a result, rogue
bands have come after
our valuables like
hungry vultures!

20
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:37,434
Like those poor ants!

21
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:40,474
So all of us who
remain here must
stand united as
one!

22
00:03:40,508 --> 00:03:44,415
What're you babbling
about? Sure, we've
had incidents like that
before, but every time

23
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:46,954
we've just beaten
the stuffing out of
our attackers!

24
00:03:46,987 --> 00:03:48,423
No, what I mean-

25
00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:50,962
Isn't that Big Brother
Shikamaru's mom?

26
00:03:50,995 --> 00:03:53,099
Boy, she's
really intense!

27
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,936
Yeah, I'll say!

28
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,443
You got that right!
The Leaf Mom's
Association has been
around for decades!

29
00:03:58,476 --> 00:04:00,848
Don't underestimate
the mom's of the
Village!

30
00:04:00,882 --> 00:04:04,823
And Big Sister
Sakura's mother
seems pretty
fired up, too.

31
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:09,365
Everyone's afraid of
us! No one's going to
come here and attack
us! Don't you think

32
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:10,968
so Mrs. Yamanaka?

33
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:12,872
That's right.
That's right.

34
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:17,114
Well, yes, that has
been the case in the
past, it's true, but
I think we should

35
00:04:17,147 --> 00:04:20,387
consider every
possibility right
now, just to be
on the safe side.

36
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,395
I mean, there's no
telling what a band
of rogues like the
Akatsuki might form

37
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:27,301
again and make a
move on the Hidden
Leaf Village!

38
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:32,377
And I just thought
that working together
would be a good way
to raise our morale

39
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:34,649
in this difficult
time. But never mind
now...

40
00:04:34,683 --> 00:04:38,791
Stop mumbling! We'll
be fine! We'll do
things like we
always have!

41
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:42,331
That's right! We
can't afford to let
fear change the way
we lead our lives.

42
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:46,673
We're all just going
to keep laughing,
crying, getting angry,
and laughing again!

43
00:04:46,707 --> 00:04:52,484
And when our husbands
return, we'll welcome
them back with smiles
and open arms. If we do

44
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:56,459
that, then all our
lives will simply
go back to normal!

45
00:04:56,492 --> 00:04:58,496
Yeah! Good for
you! You tell
them girl!

46
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,333
Mind your own
business, four-
eyes!

47
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,137
What?! How dare you!

48
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:03,306
Huh?

49
00:05:05,477 --> 00:05:10,320
Uh... Is it okay
to leave things
like this?

50
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:14,696
What if Ebisu Sensei
is right? What if
rogues actually do
attack the village?

51
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:19,573
Yeah, right. Come on!
What we should really
be worried about is
that we're so young

52
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:22,010
they wouldn't let us
go to the battlefield!

53
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,787
If only... I were
just a little bit
older!

54
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,158
Watase! You're
so cool!

55
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:31,329
(annoyed grunt)

56
00:05:31,362 --> 00:05:35,738
You know, protecting
the village is also an
important responsibility!

57
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:40,280
Hnh! Give me a break!
Ninja only earn their
reputations through
what they do on the

58
00:05:40,313 --> 00:05:44,255
battlefield!
Protecting the
Village won't win
us any honor!

59
00:05:44,288 --> 00:05:45,691
(frustrated grunt)

60
00:05:54,375 --> 00:06:00,020
Grandpa, I wonder what
you would've done if
you were in a situation
like this.

61
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:06,065
Well, I guess that
since you were Hokage,
you'd be out fighting
on the battlefield.

62
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:10,575
Konohamaru, I've
been meaning to
ask you. So, tell
me...

63
00:06:10,608 --> 00:06:12,712
...Do you have
the Will of Fire?

64
00:06:13,346 --> 00:06:14,983
The Will of Fire?

65
00:06:15,016 --> 00:06:19,526
Yes, it's a strong
will to protect the
village, no matter
what it takes.

66
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:21,697
To protect the
village...

67
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,066
<i>Konohamaru!</i>

68
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:23,801
Huh?!

69
00:06:24,603 --> 00:06:26,740
Trouble! Big
Trouble!

70
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:29,478
What's going on?!

71
00:06:29,512 --> 00:06:32,484
Just a little while ago,
my mom asked me to get
her some medicinal
herbs, so I headed to

72
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:35,992
the mountain on the
east side of the
village, and that's
when it happened!

73
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:46,312
What?! Seriously?!
Suspicious ninja
in the forest?!

74
00:06:46,345 --> 00:06:49,619
Yeah, I saw a
ton of 'em,
Konohamaru.

75
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:56,032
Huh?

76
00:07:05,618 --> 00:07:09,592
I couldn't believe
how many! Maybe
a hundred!

77
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:12,598
You saw a
hundred ninja?!

78
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:16,740
Hey! Konohamaru!
We're in seriously
big trouble, here!

79
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:21,617
What? What happened,
Udon?! And what's the
deal with your hair?!

80
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:27,394
You gotta hear this,
Konohamaru! I was
in the forest to the
east, foraging for

81
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:30,568
some matsutakes, and
that's when I saw it.

82
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:38,751
When everybody finally
comes back from the war,
I'm going to give all of
them a whole bunch of

83
00:07:38,784 --> 00:07:41,657
these delicious
matsutakes to eat!

84
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:48,169
I'm gonna roast all
of them up! It'll be
awesome! I can almost
smell them right now!

85
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:48,971
Hold on...

86
00:07:49,438 --> 00:07:51,843
Ahhhh! Hot! Hot!

87
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:03,132
Before I knew it, it
was a raging inferno!

88
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:04,936
Ahhhhh!

89
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,760
Good, huh? I can't
wait! I'm going to
eat them all up
right now!

90
00:08:16,793 --> 00:08:20,266
The way that these
were roasted...
I wonder...

91
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,974
Like a fire-style
ninja, or one who's
skilled with-

92
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:25,243
<i>Ahhhhhh!</i>

93
00:08:25,276 --> 00:08:26,212
What's wrong?

94
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:27,882
The western side
of the village!

95
00:08:27,915 --> 00:08:29,284
What?

96
00:08:29,318 --> 00:08:30,921
On the west
side, too?!

97
00:08:30,955 --> 00:08:34,261
There were a whole
bunch of these
humungous giants!

98
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,207
A giant ninja?

99
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,711
What's a giant
ninja?

100
00:08:58,744 --> 00:09:01,415
A ninja that's a
giant! What do
you think, Moegi?!

101
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:03,754
That's not an
explanation!

102
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:06,325
Man, what's going
on here?

103
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:07,194
<i>Guys!</i>

104
00:09:08,229 --> 00:09:10,568
Listen to this!
To the east of
the village...

105
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:12,505
Now we're back to
the east side?!

106
00:09:12,538 --> 00:09:14,909
I saw a ninja
that was using
the Rasengan!

107
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:17,447
Did Big Brother
Naruto come back
home?!

108
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:19,118
No, it wasn't him.

109
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:23,226
What?! No, that
can't be! The only
ones who are able
to use the Rasengan

110
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:26,633
were the late Fourth
Hokage and Old Man
Jiraiya.

111
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,841
And among the living,
only Big Brother Naruto
and I can use it!

112
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:34,348
That's not all!
This guy created
the Rasengan with
his feet!

113
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:35,785
What?! His feet?

114
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:39,726
<i>Yeah, and once he</i>
<i>did, he kicked it.</i>

115
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:49,278
I can throw the Rasengan
with my hands, but just
barely, and to do it with
your feet... I don't get

116
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,081
how that's even
possible!

117
00:09:51,115 --> 00:09:52,785
<i>We're all cursed!</i>

118
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:54,488
Now what's going on?!

119
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:57,728
<i>A Tailed Beast</i>
<i>curses this</i>
<i>village!</i>

120
00:09:57,762 --> 00:09:59,666
Did she say
Tailed Beast?!

121
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:05,778
It's happening again!
A Tailed Beast is
attacking the village!
We're cursed, I tell you!

122
00:10:05,811 --> 00:10:07,715
Granny! Where did
you see it?!

123
00:10:07,748 --> 00:10:09,986
In the forest
to the east!

124
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,990
And you're sure
that is what a
Tailed Beast?

125
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:16,766
Of course! And this
time, it had taken
the form of a bear!

126
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,906
It's a curse!
We're all cursed!

127
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:21,643
A bear?!

128
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:31,863
Wait a minute. Let's
just take a moment to
sort through all this
information.

129
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:37,742
Something's in the
forest to the east. And
something's in the west,
too. That means, in other

130
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:40,113
words, they're
surrounding us!

131
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,476
(shocked gasp)

132
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,714
We're in big
trouble here!

133
00:11:42,638 --> 00:11:47,047
Sorry, Konohamaru. I
have trouble believing
that's possible. If
anything were foolish

134
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,453
enough to come here,
those mothers would
just chase the enemy
away.

135
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:56,600
<i>Hmph! I said what I</i>
<i>said in hopes of</i>
<i>strengthening our</i>
<i>sense of unity.</i>

136
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:01,175
But now it seems to me
that maybe I should've
just avoided getting
involved entirely.

137
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,920
Konohamaru, no more
procrastination! You
have to stay focused!

138
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:09,091
<i>You should be</i>
<i>training!</i>

139
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:11,462
So, go on!

140
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:14,636
Listen! They're
coming! The enemy!

141
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:18,911
<i>Giant ninja are coming</i>
<i>to attack our village</i>
<i>while it's vulnerable!</i>

142
00:12:18,944 --> 00:12:19,612
What?!

143
00:12:19,646 --> 00:12:21,616
They can breathe fire!

144
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,885
Oh, my!

145
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,822
And they can use
the Rasengan!

146
00:12:24,856 --> 00:12:26,292
Oh, dear!
Frightening!

147
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:29,532
And they also have
a giant bear with
them, too!

148
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:31,803
(chuckling)

149
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:41,656
We can't rely on the
adults to handle this
any longer!

150
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,131
So we, the young
generation, are gonna
have to protect the
village ourselves!

151
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,635
Yeah!

152
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:50,507
Enough, Konohamaru!
Stop pretending that
you're the Hokage
around here!

153
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,647
I don't care if
you are the Third
Hokage's grandson!

154
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,584
What's that?!

155
00:12:55,618 --> 00:13:00,226
Listen to me! From
now on, real skills are
what count. That's how
it was for Naruto, too.

156
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:04,234
The loser of the
Academy has now
become the hero of
the village. It's

157
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:07,642
also rumored that
he's the closest to
being selected as
Hokage after the

158
00:13:07,675 --> 00:13:11,783
next one. Don't you
get it? These days
connections like
what family you're

159
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:13,386
from don't matter.

160
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:16,793
All that counts is what
you've accomplished out
on the battlefield.

161
00:13:16,826 --> 00:13:19,599
Nobody cares about
looking after the
village!

162
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,304
Really?! Just how
selfish are you?!

163
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:23,205
Let's fight!

164
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:25,276
Yeah! Let's go!

165
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,913
(attacking grunts)

166
00:13:27,347 --> 00:13:30,988
(crowd cheering)

167
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:34,729
Do you have it
in you, Watase?!

168
00:13:34,762 --> 00:13:36,599
The Will of Fire?

169
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:37,868
What does that mean?!

170
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:39,539
Go on, get him,
Konohamaru!

171
00:13:39,572 --> 00:13:41,576
You can take
this guy!

172
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:47,855
It's the will to protect
this village no matter
what it takes!

173
00:13:47,888 --> 00:13:52,230
If someone doesn't
possess the Will of
Fire, then they could
never become Hokage!

174
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:56,205
Hah! Yeah, right.
And you think you
have it, huh?!

175
00:13:56,238 --> 00:13:57,407
(painful grunt)

176
00:13:58,275 --> 00:13:59,111
(shocked gasps)

177
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:05,490
No way...

178
00:14:05,524 --> 00:14:09,264
We're both on the
same side. I don't
want to hurt you!

179
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:11,803
You idiot! I'm the
one who's hurting you!

180
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:16,211
If I fell to your
kunai, you'd be the
one hurt! You'd have
to the bear that burden!

181
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:19,585
And that's why I'm
trying so desperately
not to lose now!

182
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,570
Konohamaru!

183
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,149
(annoyed grunt)

184
00:14:35,183 --> 00:14:38,957
No matter what it
takes, I will protect
the village!

185
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,195
Even for just
one person!

186
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:45,436
Konohamaru, where
are you going?!

187
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,042
Uh, hold up,
Konohamaru!

188
00:14:55,624 --> 00:14:59,498
Moegi, is this where
you saw all those
ninja earlier?

189
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:00,567
Yeah, I'm sure.

190
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:04,074
This is where I
was, too. When I
saw all that fire.

191
00:15:04,107 --> 00:15:07,080
Right. Wait! Did
you guys hear that?!

192
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:09,284
Hey, what's
the matter?

193
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:15,296
Ninja jumping from
branch to branch...

194
00:15:29,224 --> 00:15:31,596
Ninja breathing
fire...

195
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:44,254
Ninja who use Rasengan
with their feet...

196
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:51,068
A Tailed Beast
in bear form...

197
00:15:57,882 --> 00:16:02,323
The hostilities forced
us to flee from the Land
of Frost and come here to
the safety of the Hidden

198
00:16:02,357 --> 00:16:07,367
Leaf Village. All the
performers you see here
make up the Illusion
Circus. I hope that

199
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,639
you'll remember
to come see us!

200
00:16:09,672 --> 00:16:10,707
(stunned gasp)

201
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:15,283
<i>The only ghost was</i>
<i>the one in our</i>
<i>imagination.</i>

202
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:17,086
It's just like that
old saying goes...

203
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,094
What do you mean
our imagination?!
How could you two
ever mistake a

204
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:24,234
circus troupe for
enemy ninja?! Aw,
what a mess!

205
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:26,573
And I made such a
big deal out of this!

206
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:29,545
This is just so
not cool!

207
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:33,052
What's that?

208
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,191
Big trouble!
Come on! Quick!

209
00:16:36,225 --> 00:16:39,064
They're on the way
toward the Village!
Like you said!

210
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:40,233
No...
Actually...

211
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,538
They came from
the west! Without
warning!

212
00:16:42,571 --> 00:16:43,640
The west?!

213
00:16:44,976 --> 00:16:47,548
Anyway, Watase told
me to get you! So
so come on, let's go!

214
00:16:47,581 --> 00:16:48,550
Take me there!

215
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:58,135
<i>(frightened screams)</i>

216
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:08,055
We are the Sumo Wrestlers!
We'll take on both ninja
and samurai! And win!

217
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:15,704
This whole village
now belongs to me,
Yokozuna!

218
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:17,307
What's a Sumo
Wrestler?

219
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,479
Dunno. I've never
heard of them before!

220
00:17:20,514 --> 00:17:23,118
A group of giants
in the forest to
the west...

221
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:24,655
The western side
of the village!

222
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:27,795
There were a whole
bunch of these
humongous giants!

223
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,382
I get it! That piece
of intel was the only
one that was real!

224
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:39,619
(painful grunt)

225
00:17:42,056 --> 00:17:43,359
(painful grunts)

226
00:17:45,229 --> 00:17:46,733
Bring it on, kid!

227
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,670
(painful grunt)

228
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:51,609
Watase!
Hang on!

229
00:17:51,643 --> 00:17:53,312
I'm coming!

230
00:17:55,182 --> 00:17:57,621
Oh, no you don't!

231
00:17:57,655 --> 00:17:59,457
Hey! Wait a
minute!

232
00:18:05,336 --> 00:18:09,679
Get out of the way!
All of your husbands
aren't around because
they are away at war,

233
00:18:09,712 --> 00:18:10,681
aren't they?

234
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:15,022
And while they're gone,
we're going to take
everything valuable that
you have in this village!

235
00:18:15,056 --> 00:18:21,234
There are still idiots
like you around, huh?
What a joke! It makes
no difference whatsoever

236
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,138
whether our husbands
are here away!

237
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:27,615
The Mom's Association
will protect this
village with our Will
of Fire!

238
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,252
The Will of Fire!

239
00:18:30,286 --> 00:18:34,427
What a load of hogwash!
All right, boys, let's
go teach these women
a little lesson.

240
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:35,262
(attack yell)

241
00:18:35,296 --> 00:18:37,801
Attack with
everything
we've got!

242
00:18:37,835 --> 00:18:38,770
(hitting grunt)

243
00:18:38,803 --> 00:18:40,239
Protect the
children!

244
00:18:40,272 --> 00:18:43,780
(attacking grunts)

245
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:46,619
They're incredible!

246
00:18:46,653 --> 00:18:49,057
To those who possess
the Will of Fire...

247
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:53,967
Everyone in the whole
village is considered
to be a true family
member.

248
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,138
The desire to
protect one's
family...

249
00:18:56,171 --> 00:19:00,647
...is universally
understood, and it
builds very strong
and deep bonds

250
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,920
between each and
every person in
the entire village.

251
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:08,697
As long as everyone
in the Hidden Leaf
embraces the Will of
Fire, the village can

252
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,638
weather any challenge,
no matter what it may
face.

253
00:19:12,671 --> 00:19:16,378
Grandpa, so this is
the true meaning...

254
00:19:17,413 --> 00:19:19,284
...of the Will
of Fire.

255
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:22,758
Ahh! No! Retreat!

256
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:25,597
We give up!

257
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,833
No escape!

258
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,636
Wait! Konohamaru!

259
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,341
(frightened screams)

260
00:19:33,212 --> 00:19:34,749
Out of the way!

261
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:36,786
Move it! Now!

262
00:19:38,288 --> 00:19:40,359
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

263
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,839
(charging growl)

264
00:19:52,283 --> 00:19:53,853
Here, take this!

265
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:56,926
Rasengan!

266
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,969
(painful screams)

267
00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:14,628
Wow, Konohamaru,
I've really gotta
hand it to you.

268
00:20:14,662 --> 00:20:17,467
All right! I'll
carry on the
Will of Fire!

269
00:20:17,935 --> 00:20:18,670
Huh?

270
00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:25,082
(everyone cheering)

271
00:20:25,116 --> 00:20:27,955
Come on! Lift him
up! Let's celebrate!

272
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:31,161
Oh, no! You
don't have to!

273
00:20:31,194 --> 00:20:32,731
Up you go!

274
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:34,434
Ahh!

275
00:20:35,604 --> 00:20:43,252
<i>Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!</i>
<i>Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!</i>

276
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,957
Well, it's almost
dinner time!

277
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:49,832
With both Ino and
my husband gone,
I guess it's
leftovers again!

278
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:53,372
It's too much trouble
to cook just for my
husband, who's lying
around the house like

279
00:20:53,405 --> 00:20:56,111
a slug. What do you
say we all have
potluck?

280
00:20:56,144 --> 00:21:00,687
Yeah, that's a great
idea. I'll just bring
over our leftovers
from lunch!

281
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,023
Sounds good!

282
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,137
You're our leader,
Konohamaru! I mean
Big Brother Naruto's
got nothing on you!

283
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,276
(giggling laughter)

284
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,249
You know, I sure
could get used
to this!

285

00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:24,635
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

287
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,864
Bro, hold up!
Naruto's gotta
get through!

288
00:23:02,898 --> 00:23:06,906
<i>If you continue to</i>

289
