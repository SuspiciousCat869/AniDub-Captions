1
00:00:10,332 --> 00:00:12,300
{\an1}I consider you a friend.

2
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:21,808
{\an1}In the past, friend
was just a word to me.
Nothing more, nothing less.

3
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:25,811
{\an1}But after meeting you,
I realized something.

4
00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:30,180
<i>What's important is the</i>
<i>meaning of that word.</i>

5
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:33,783
{\an1}What does it mean to you?

6
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:40,788
{\an1}You must decide for yourself
what you can do for Sasuke.
Think hard on that.

7
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,909
{\an7}<i>Danzo. I wonder what</i>
<i>kind of jutsu he uses.</i>

8
00:01:26,723 --> 00:01:27,456
{\an1}(ct shocked reax)

9
00:01:28,524 --> 00:01:31,092
{\an7}<i>Whoa! What's up with</i>
<i>his right arm?!</i>

10
00:01:31,126 --> 00:01:35,562
{\an7}<i>He's got multiple Sharingan</i>
<i>embedded in it!? How gross!</i>

11
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:43,335
{\an1}How did you get those
eyes in your right arm?

12
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:48,874
{\an1}Well, in various ways.
It's a long story.

13
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:53,643
{\an1}Any explanation would probably
make me angrier anyway.

14
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:58,045
Never mind. I've already
decided to kill you.

15
00:02:00,148 --> 00:02:02,784
{\an1}<i>But there is one thing I</i>
<i>want to ask you first.</i>

16
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:08,454
{\an1}Is it true that Itachi
slaughtered the whole
Uchiha Clan,

17
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:12,657
{\an1}Because he was following
orders you and the other
Hidden Leaf elders gave him?

18
00:02:30,805 --> 00:02:31,605
{\an1}<i>What?</i>

19
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:42,246
[impressed]
O~oh!

20
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:44,247
That's Sasuke's?

21
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:48,518
{\an1}I see. So this
is the Susano'o.

22
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:42,270
Danzo's Right Arm

23
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:49,009
{\an1}So, what do you think
we should do now?

24
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:53,846
{\an1}I think the first thing
we have to do is return
to the Hidden Leaf

25
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:56,180
{\an1}and discuss what happened
at the Five Kage Summit.

26
00:04:57,448 --> 00:04:58,883
{\an1}And talk about Sakura.

27
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:04,921
{\an1}The real me will continue
to go forward with Sakura,
and keep her away from Sasuke.

28
00:05:06,121 --> 00:05:07,723
Please do not
worry about her.

29
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:12,893
{\an4}Then again, it would
probably be better to
talk her down in person
and bring her back home.

30
00:05:15,628 --> 00:05:16,563
Hmm.

31
00:05:19,264 --> 00:05:20,065
All right!

32
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,602
Yamato, you take
Naruto and head back
to the Leaf Village.

33
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,572
I'm gonna go bring
Sakura back.

34
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:31,675
{\an1}She's just no match for Sasuke.
Going after him is suicide.

35
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:37,046
{\an1}I'll send my Ninja Hounds
to report on the Summit.
Since it's urgent.

36
00:05:37,078 --> 00:05:38,179
I understand.

37
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:41,481
{\an1}Sai. Guide me to where
Sakura is right now.

38
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:42,549
{\an1}Yes, sir.

39
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,300
[Naruto]
What the hell do
you guys want?

40
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:10,503
We just overheard the
three of you talking
about Sasuke Uchiha.

41
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,471
{\an1}We want to know about him,
and you're gonna tell us.

42
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,975
Why? What does all of
this have to do with
you Cloud ninja anyway?

43
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:19,209
{\an1}A whole lot! 'Cause
Sasuke Uchiha of the Leaf,

44
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:21,778
{\an1}Assaulted the
Hidden Cloud Village!

45
00:06:21,812 --> 00:06:22,679
[gasp]
[gasp]

46
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:27,283
{\an1}You heard him; your
Rogue Shinobi kidnapped
our beloved master!

47
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:30,285
{\an1}We don't even know if
he's dead or alive!

48
00:06:30,318 --> 00:06:31,853
{\an1}That's a lie!

49
00:06:32,252 --> 00:06:33,054
Sasuke...

50
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:35,789
{\an1}Why would he ever do
something like that?!

51
00:06:36,056 --> 00:06:38,257
{\an1}How the hell should we know
the Akatsuki's motives?!

52
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,894
The Akatsuki?!
What are you
talking about?

53
00:06:42,127 --> 00:06:44,730
{\an1}Ugh! You guys are
trying my patience!

54
00:06:44,763 --> 00:06:46,931
{\an1}Of course, Sasuke's a
member of the Akatsuki!

55
00:06:48,298 --> 00:06:52,569
{\an1}It's because you let your Rogue
Ninja run loose that Lord
Raikage dispatched us here!

56
00:06:53,135 --> 00:06:56,038
{\an1}<i>We've already gotten</i>
<i>the Hokage's permission</i>
<i>to get rid of him!</i>

57
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,475
{\an8}<i>Sasuke kidnapped</i>
<i>their master?</i>

58
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,243
We will avenge
our master!

59
00:07:04,276 --> 00:07:06,013
{\an1}We're going to
take down Sasuke!

60
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:21,323
{\an5}Itachi Uchiha.
His whole life
was about
self-sacrifice.

61
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:26,061
{\an1}<i>He died for Sasuke.</i>
<i>and for the Hidden</i>
<i>Leaf Village as well.</i>

62
00:07:26,694 --> 00:07:30,230
{\an1}<i>Sasuke lost everything,</i>
<i>and ended up all alone.</i>

63
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,800
{\an1}<i>The price paid for peace</i>
<i>in the Hidden Leaf Village.</i>

64
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:36,035
{\an1}<i>Can you blame Sasuke?</i>

65
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:45,274
{\an4}Sasuke's goal now is to wreak
vengeance upon the Hidden Leaf
for what they did to Itachi and
to the entire Uchiha clan.

66
00:07:45,307 --> 00:07:48,511
{\an1}<i>Everything he does</i>
<i>is for revenge.</i>

67
00:07:48,544 --> 00:07:51,680
{\an1}<i>He's the real thing.</i>
<i>A true avenger!</i>

68
00:07:52,547 --> 00:07:54,149
<i>That hate...</i>

69
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:56,817
{\an1}<i>That is Sasuke's Ninja Way!</i>

70
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:12,429
{\an1}They'll dispose of
Sasuke themselves.

71
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:15,864
{\an1}Your comrades are all committed.
And are ready to move.

72
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:23,437
{\an4}<i>Sakura isn't a fool. </i>
<i>Or a child who doesn't </i>
<i>understand the circumstances.</i>
<i>And the situation.</i>

73
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,140
{\an1}She's planning to
kill Sasuke herself.

74
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:35,212
{\an1}And if you've truly
resolved to become a Kage,

75
00:08:35,947 --> 00:08:39,649
{\an1}Then you're going to have
to do what needs to be done
as Sasuke's friend.

76
00:08:47,055 --> 00:08:47,655
{\an1}Huh?

77
00:08:49,057 --> 00:08:50,958
{\an1}Naruto!
What's the matter?!

78
00:09:08,171 --> 00:09:09,638
{\an1}Calm down, Naruto!

79
00:09:09,672 --> 00:09:10,906
He's
hyperventilating!

80
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,141
Slow your
breathing down!

81
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:13,875
{\an1}Naruto!

82
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:18,412
{\an1}Naruto. Can you hear me?
Naruto? Naruto!

83
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:24,783
I'll ask once more!

84
00:09:26,985 --> 00:09:31,789
{\an4}Is it true that Itachi
eliminated my clan, following
orders that were given to him by
you and the Hidden Leaf Elders?

85
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:38,927
{\an1}I asked you if it's true!

86
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:40,661
[squeezed]
Ghhh!

87
00:09:44,065 --> 00:09:45,499
Answer me now!

88
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,501
I...

89
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:50,703
{\an1}I didn't think that he
was that kind of man.

90
00:09:52,437 --> 00:09:53,438
Curse him.

91
00:09:54,572 --> 00:09:57,541
{\an1}Itachi told you everything
before he died, didn't he!

92
00:09:58,675 --> 00:10:03,446
{\an1}<i>It seems... you alone...</i>
<i>really were... special.</i>

93
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:10,051
{\an4}[Madara]
He gave you a reason to seek
revenge against him, and hoped
it would make you stronger.

94
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:14,621
{\an1}I have acted like the
older brother you
desired for one reason.

95
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:17,190
{\an1}Because I wanted to discover
how powerful you were.

96
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:23,728
{\an1}I needed to find a worthy
opponent to test the limits
of my own abilities.

97
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:26,396
{\an1}You have that
unique potential.

98
00:10:27,564 --> 00:10:31,634
{\an1}<i>Now I've made you hate me.</i>
<i>Now you have the desire</i>
<i>to defeat me.</i>

99
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:34,702
{\an1}<i>Which is exactly why I am</i>
<i>going to allow you to live.</i>

100
00:10:34,736 --> 00:10:37,404
{\an1}Don't you see?
It's all for my
own benefit.

101
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:39,640
{\an1}My foolish little brother.

102
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:44,944
{\an1}If you wish to kill me one day,
in hate, and revenge,

103
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:49,547
{\an1}Surviving in such an
unsightly manner as this.

104
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,651
{\an1}By all means, flee.
Cling to your wretched life.

105
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:57,754
{\an1}And then, one day, when
you possess the same eyes.

106
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:59,088
{\an1}Come back and face me!!

107
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:06,760
{\an4}<i>[Madara]</i>
<i>He wanted you to believe that</i>
<i>the Uchiha was a proud clan</i>
<i>from the Hidden Leaf Village.</i>

108
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:12,199
{\an1}<i>He begged the Hokage to</i>
<i>make sure you would</i>
<i>never learn the truth.</i>

109
00:11:12,865 --> 00:11:18,435
{\an1}<i>And from the moment he left the</i>
<i>village, he resigned himself to</i>
<i>battling you to the death.</i>

110
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:23,906
{\an1}You really have gotten
stronger, Sasuke.

111
00:11:25,007 --> 00:11:27,676
{\an1}<i>In order to bestow</i>
<i>upon you new powers,</i>

112
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:37,517
{\an1}<i>He accepted disgrace in the</i>
<i>place of honor, and hatred</i>
<i>in the place of love.</i>

113
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:42,688
{\an1}<i>And yet Itachi still died</i>
<i>with a smile on his face.</i>

114
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:48,358
{\an1}<i>He bequeathed to you the</i>
<i>Uchiha name, still fooling</i>
<i>you to the very end.</i>

115
00:11:49,192 --> 00:11:51,094
More lies!
Everything you
say is a lie!

116
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:52,728
You answer me!

117
00:11:53,128 --> 00:11:56,165
{\an1}I didn't think...
Itachi...

118
00:11:56,631 --> 00:12:00,801
{\an1}was the kind of man who would
reveal the secrets that had
been entrusted to him.

119
00:12:01,802 --> 00:12:04,770
{\an1}That means...
that it's true, then?!

120
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:41,598
{\an1}Self-sacrifice.
that's what
epitomizes a shinobi.

121
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:48,937
{\an1}Never seeing the light of day,
toiling in the shadows. That's
the way of a true shinobi.

122
00:12:50,272 --> 00:12:55,541
{\an4}<i>[Danzo]</i>
<i>And not just Itachi.</i>
<i>Countless shinobi have</i>
<i>died the same way.</i>

123
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:59,946
{\an1}<i>This world could not</i>
<i>function on ideals</i>
<i>and pleasantries.</i>

124
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:05,284
{\an1}No, it's entirely thanks
to people like him that
peace has been maintained.

125
00:13:05,716 --> 00:13:10,453
{\an1}People like you who've
misconstrued Itachi's
will wouldn't understand.

126
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:16,992
{\an1}<i>Still, Itachi revealing</i>
<i>such a secret to you makes</i>
<i>him a traitor to the Leaf.</i>

127
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:31,436
Don't speak any
further about Itachi.

128
00:13:32,304 --> 00:13:33,437
{\an1}<i>[Danzo]</i>
<i>[no longer choking]</i>
<i>Sure.</i>

129
00:13:34,972 --> 00:13:37,408
Next let's battle with
our eyes instead.

130
00:13:57,122 --> 00:13:59,891
{\an7}<i>What's going on?!</i>
<i>He should've died earlier!</i>

131
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:05,628
{\an7}<i>I only sense one chakra with</i>
<i>Danzo's signature. That's</i>
<i>definitely not a clone!</i>

132
00:14:06,662 --> 00:14:09,198
{\an1}Just as I thought. Susano'o.

133
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:12,334
That's splendid armor to
protect yourself with.

134
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,612
{\an1}And the power in its
attack is incredible.

135
00:14:35,285 --> 00:14:40,621
{\an7}<i>He escaped again! If that</i>
<i>wasn't a clone either,</i>
<i>then, is it genjutsu?</i>

136
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:50,129
{\an7}<i>I don't sense any</i>
<i>disturbance in Sasuke's</i>
<i>chakra, and my chakra is</i>
<i>stable, too.</i>

137
00:14:52,264 --> 00:14:54,565
{\an7}<i>If neither of us is</i>

138
00:14:57,434 --> 00:15:00,737
{\an7}<i>Then what sort of</i>

139
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:30,459
Amaterasu!

140
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:35,529
Aaagh! Rrrgh!
[choke]

141

[panting]

142
00:15:48,106 --> 00:15:50,875
First Susano'o and
now Amaterasu.

143
00:15:51,442 --> 00:15:55,478
{\an5}That's too much just
to test Danzo's power.
He's going to tire
himself out.

144
00:15:58,347 --> 00:15:59,181
Uh!

145
00:16:02,283 --> 00:16:03,251
[inhale]

146
00:16:03,284 --> 00:16:05,018

Summoning Jutsu!

{\an1}[relieved sigh]

151
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:40,512
{\an1}Hmm! A new summoning.
When did you get that?

152
00:16:41,513 --> 00:16:44,781
[panting]

153
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:48,885
{\an1}The Amaterasu.
Haven't seen
that in a while.

154
00:16:49,352 --> 00:16:51,787
{\an1}You're Itachi's
younger brother,
that's for sure.

155
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:09,367
[gasp]

156
00:17:11,235 --> 00:17:13,537
{\an1}You've taken over
Itachi's jutsu.

157
00:17:13,903 --> 00:17:16,973
I told you not to say
another word about him!

158
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:20,943
{\an1}Two brothers whose
abilities are identical.

159
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:23,711
{\an1}How could what your eyes
perceive be so different?

160
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,782
{\an1}<i>Just admit it: the truth</i>
<i>about Itachi isn't</i>
<i>important to you at all.</i>

161
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:33,986
{\an1}Instead you simply want
to destroy everything
with your hatred.

162
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:39,723
{\an1}All you're doing is making
the sacrifice of the
Uchiha Clan meaningless.

163
00:17:40,224 --> 00:17:44,260
{\an1}You have no right whatsoever
to speak about the Uchiha!

{\an8}<i>What's going on?</i>

169
00:19:37,246 --> 00:19:38,146
{\an8}<i>No way!</i>

170
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,152
It's useless.

171
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:03,465
Huh?

172
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,574
{\an1}What?! But how?!

173
00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:18,276
{\an1}Itachi?!

{\an4}<i>He's misinterpreted your</i>

Yeeeeee!

180
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:29,408
{\an1}Finally! It is time for me to be
the star of a mini corner!

181

{\an4}At least you were in
the main story;
I'm barely in this
show at all anymore!

186
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,254
<i>So I'm taking over</i>

{\an1}Aww!

No! I'm not going

You know it's true!
