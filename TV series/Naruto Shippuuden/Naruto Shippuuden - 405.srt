Hello..!?

12

Hey, come on!

13
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:20,257
{\an1}Now listen, I don't think this
is the time to be fighting, do
you?

14
00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:32,804
{\an1}Here. Let's call a truce
till we get out of here.
What do you say?

15
00:02:33,506 --> 00:02:37,844
{\an1}Yeah, okay fine. But I
don't need charity
from a Great Nation!

16
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:40,214
"Charity?" What
do you mean?

17
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:42,751
{\an1}Unsealing Jutsu.

18
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:47,256
{\an1}If you had water, you
could've just said so.

19
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:51,895
{\an1}The Great Nations...
Don't understand pain.

20

<i>Pain? What are you</i>

21
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,970
Exactly.

22
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:05,613
{\an1}You don't understand pain.
Or the pain you inflict
upon smaller nations.

23
00:03:05,646 --> 00:03:08,517
{\an1}Sorry, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

24

{\an1}But you do understand that
we're gonna need to help
each other...

25
00:03:11,853 --> 00:03:14,991
{\an1}That is, of course,
if we wanna make it out
of here in one piece!

26
00:03:15,024 --> 00:03:17,294
{\an1}Help each other...?

27
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:20,599
{\an1}I wonder what this
place is...

28

<i>(Ajisai)</i>
<i>An ancient ruin of the</i>
<i>Land of Wind...</i>

be too difficult to make
it up that direction...

32
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,916
{\an1}You're right.

33
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:38,354
{\an1}Shall we try
that way?

34
00:03:38,387 --> 00:03:40,523
We don't really
have a choice.

35
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:47,331
(Tenten)
So, these teammates
of yours...

36
00:03:47,365 --> 00:03:48,833
{\an1}(Ajisai)
What about them?

37
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:52,271
{\an1}My teammates don't have a lot of
search and rescue experience,

38
00:03:52,304 --> 00:03:55,341
{\an1}so I don't think that
I can depend on them
to find me down here.

39
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:58,979
{\an1}I plan to get myself
out of here as well.

40
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,724
<i>(Rock Lee)</i>
<i>Huh...</i>

41

{\an1}Did you find something?

42
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,964
{\an1}Not yet. I thought this
was an entrance, but
it is just a dead end.

43
00:04:25,145 --> 00:04:29,418
{\an1}I heard that it rains all
year long in the Hidden
Rain Village. Is that true?

44
00:04:29,451 --> 00:04:32,154
{\an1}Yes, that is true.

45
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:36,092
{\an1}Wow. I don't think I
could even imagine that...

46
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,664
{\an1}Yes, I doubt
you could.

47
00:04:39,698 --> 00:04:44,135
{\an1}You've had an attitude
towards me this whole time.
But, you know...

48
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:49,376
{\an4}You guys are also at least
partly to blame for us not
knowing much about the Hidden
Rain.

49
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:50,944
{\an1}Seriously?

50
00:04:50,977 --> 00:04:52,312
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>Yeah...</i>

51
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:55,283
{\an1}<i>...I've heard that secrecy is a</i>
<i>doctrine of the Hidden Rain. </i>

52
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:59,121
{\an1}<i>So it's no wonder that we don't</i>
<i>know anything about you!</i>

53
00:05:00,724 --> 00:05:04,495
{\an1}We only have contact with you
guys through things like the
Chunin Exams.

54
00:05:04,528 --> 00:05:08,999
{\an1}But because this is a test,
instead of talking to each
other, we fight.

55
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,802
{\an1}<i>(Ajisai)</i>
<i>That's true...</i>

56
00:05:10,836 --> 00:05:13,506
{\an1}Plus, you guys can come to
Hidden Leaf or Hidden Sand,

57
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:18,112
{\an1}but if we tried to go to the
Hidden Rain, we wouldn't be
allowed to enter.

58
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:22,450
{\an1}A small nation like the
Hidden Rain has to be
extremely careful.

59
00:05:22,484 --> 00:05:26,655
{\an1}Other small nations don't do
that.  The Hidden Rain's a
special case.

60
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:32,129
{\an1}You're right, The Hidden
Rain Village <i>is</i> special.

61
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,409
{\an5}(Konan)
Small nations become embroiled
in the wars of the Great
Nations,

62
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:46,347
{\an1}ending up as those nations'
battlefields, left to suffer the
consequences.

63
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,252
{\an1}But Lord Pain wants to bring an
end to such a world.

64
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:54,924
{\an1}He wants the ignorant Great
Nations to feel and understand
our pain...

65
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:57,561
...and to bring
about true peace.

I wonder if there are more...

84

{\an1}I hope not.  But they're ants,
so this place is probably
swarming with them.

85
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:29,676
Let's catch one.

86
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:32,847
{\an1}What!? Why would you want to
catch one of those things?!

87
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,716
To tame it as a
Summoning Animal.

{\an1}They're strange, the
other villages...

298
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:06,963
There are... all
kinds of shinobi...

299
00:21:07,597 --> 00:21:10,568
{\an1}<i>I wonder if the Hidden Rain</i>
<i>Village is really going to</i>
<i>change... </i>

300
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:15,205
{\an1}We'll change it. By having faith
in Lord Pain and Lady Angel.

301
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:19,979
{\an1}Let's go. We have to
look for a Jinchuriki.

302
00:22:57,734 --> 00:23:03,642
{\an5}<i>(Ino)</i>
<i>We should've just headed</i>
<i>straight for the goal rather</i>
<i>than going with your strategy!</i>

303
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:06,211
{\an1}<i>(Sakura)</i>
<i>What are you talking about?! </i>
<i>You agreed to it!  </i>

304
00:23:06,244 --> 00:23:10,550
{\an1}<i>(Sakura)</i>
<i>Ino, you just drank too much</i>
<i>water, you bloated blister!</i>

305
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:14,956
{\an5}<i>(Ino)</i>
<i>Oh yeah? Well you'd have to</i>
<i>drink 100 times more than me,</i>
<i>Miss Flat-As-A-Board!</i>

306
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:20,362
<i>(Choji)</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>"The Place Where I Belong."</i>

307
00:23:20,396 --> 00:23:20,463
{\an1}<i>(Sakura)</i>
<i>If drinking water is all that</i>
<i>it takes, I'd be happy!</i>
