{\an1}why he would've done
that...

him every day.

him an allowance!

157
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:20,675
{\an1}<i>They were especially</i>

158
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,675
{\an1}<i>was said that you</i>

160
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,478
{\an1}<i>Anyway... one of the</i>

163
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:40,214
{\an1}<i>...which made the</i>

164
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:46,483
{\an1}<i>Unfortunately,...</i>
<i>shortly after taking</i>
<i>the girl as his</i>

165
00:10:46,516 --> 00:10:49,783
{\an1}<i>concubine,... the</i>
<i>feudal lord became</i>
<i>ill and died. </i>

166
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:54,319
<i>"It's her fault</i>
<i>he died!", said his</i>
<i>consort. </i>

167
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:58,053
<i>The lord's widow</i>
<i>put all the blame on</i>
<i>the concubine. </i>

168
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:04,055
{\an1}Those who knew about
the Chinoike Clan's
unusual genetics...

169
00:11:04,088 --> 00:11:07,689
{\an1}were quick to throw
their full support behind
the widow's claim.

170
00:11:10,658 --> 00:11:14,758
{\an1}As a result, the girl
and her whole Clan
were banished to a

171
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,626
{\an1}place called Hell
Valley.

172
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,560
{\an1}To do that, the widow
decided to hire-

{\an1}[quietly grunting]

00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:28,296
{\an1}What did you say?!

177
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,164
{\an1}Since the Uchiha Clan
possessed the
Sharingan, they were

178
00:11:35,198 --> 00:11:38,199
{\an1}the only ones who
could resist the
Chinoike Clan and

179
00:11:38,232 --> 00:11:40,099
{\an1}their unique Visual
Jutsu.

180
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,934
{\an1}The Chinoike asked
the Uchiha to set up
a meeting place to

181
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:46,368
{\an1}negotiate... but they
were rejected.

182
00:11:48,035 --> 00:11:51,969
{\an1}So the Uchiha Clan

persecuted by the
