1
00:00:18,257 --> 00:00:18,823
Huh?

2
00:00:25,931 --> 00:00:27,066
He he he he he!

3
00:00:36,043 --> 00:00:37,144
[chuckle]

4
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:40,948
[splash]

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,155
{\an1}<i>[crashing]</i>

6
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,793
{\an1}<i>[Suigetsu]</i>
<i>For whatever reason, there are</i>
<i>a lot fewer guards around.</i>

7
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,464
{\an1}We might be able
to escape now.

8
00:00:56,634 --> 00:00:57,900
{\an1}Let's look
for Sasuke.

9
00:00:58,636 --> 00:01:00,136
You go on
ahead of me.

10
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:02,740
I'm going to go look
for my blade before
I do anything else.

11
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:06,410
{\an1}I found the key to this
place easily, but I can't
find my blade anywhere.

12
00:01:06,944 --> 00:01:09,581
{\an1}Well, the samurai did
confiscate it from
you, didn't they?

13
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:12,117
So we should look
for an armory first.

14
00:01:12,984 --> 00:01:13,551
Let's go.

15
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,221
{\an1}Wow, you're going
to help me?

16
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:20,126
{\an1}You're all right,
you know that, Jugo?
Unlike that Karin.

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,495
Where is she,
anyway?

18
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:24,063
Want to look
for her?

19
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:28,935
{\an1}Hmm. You know, ironically,
it's almost too quiet
without her around.

20
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:30,837
{\an1}Decisions, decisions.

21
00:01:33,374 --> 00:01:38,079
{\an1}I'm beginning to understand
the enemy's strategy.
But now it's gonna be my turn!

22
00:01:40,783 --> 00:01:41,883
<i>[Kabuto]</i>
<i>[chuckle]</i>

23
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:46,255
{\an1}I'm not so naïve as to
allow the enemy time
to catch their breath.

24
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:50,826
[together]
Summoning Jutsu!

25
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,068
[gasp]

26
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,912
{\an1}This is unbelievable.

27
00:02:08,447 --> 00:02:09,914
No way...
Is that?!

28
00:02:18,424 --> 00:02:21,961
{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>Former members of the Seven</i>
<i>Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist!</i>

29
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:29,169
{\an1}And out of all the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist,

30
00:02:29,203 --> 00:02:31,338
{\an1}these are the most
powerful ever!

31
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:33,107
{\an1}They chose well.

32
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:37,212
{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>The Seven Ninja Swordsmen.</i>

33
00:02:38,346 --> 00:02:39,548
{\an1}Ready, Ensui Platoon?

34
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:41,550
{\an1}I still need a
bit longer!

35
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:44,587
{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>What about you,</i>
<i>Maki of the Hidden Sand?</i>

36
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,922
{\an1}My team is ready to roll, sir!

37
00:02:47,356 --> 00:02:52,529
{\an1}All right. We need to buy
time for Ensui's platoon.
We'll all attack as one!

38
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:03,074
Aw man, it doesn't
look like my sword
is here, either.

39
00:03:03,107 --> 00:03:06,144
{\an1}You said you wanted to
collect all the lost
Hidden Mist Blades.

40
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:08,847
{\an1}But why are you so
obsessed with this
quest of yours?

41
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:13,820
{\an1}Hey, come on! You offered
to help me with this.
You giving up on me already?!

42
00:03:14,587 --> 00:03:17,690
{\an1}No, you're the one who
always gives up, Suigetsu.

43
00:03:17,724 --> 00:03:20,795
{\an1}But when it comes
to those blades,
you're very focused.

44
00:03:21,027 --> 00:03:21,896
Tsh.

45
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:25,766
I just gotta have
something that keeps
pushing me forward.

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,706
{\an4}And, well, I've always had this
dream of resurrecting the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist and
then becoming their new leader.

47
00:03:31,972 --> 00:03:32,808
{\an1}Resurrect them?

48
00:03:33,442 --> 00:03:34,074
{\an3}<i>Yeah.</i>

49
00:03:36,044 --> 00:03:39,147
{\an4}Right now, the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen of the Mist
consists of just a single
brat named Chojuro.

50
00:03:39,682 --> 00:03:43,953
{\an1}<i>Traditionally, the ninja</i>
<i>blades are handed down from</i>
<i>generation to generation.</i>

51
00:03:43,986 --> 00:03:48,224
{\an1}<i>But other than the Great</i>
<i>Twin Sword Hiramekarei,</i>
<i>the rest have gone missing.</i>

52
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:55,432
{\an4}<i>I assume Kisame has Samehada,</i>
<i>but he's a rogue ninja. And the</i>
<i>Executioner's Blade that I'd</i>
<i>found is gone again. </i>

53
00:03:59,102 --> 00:04:01,706
{\an1}<i>So officially, that unit</i>
<i>doesn't even exist today.</i>

54
00:04:04,442 --> 00:04:05,811
<i>For now, anyway.</i>

55
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,760
<i>"The First and</i>
<i>Last Opponent"</i>

56
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:53,431
{\an1}<i>It's no use. No matter</i>
<i>how many times we attack,</i>
<i>it has no effect.</i>

57
00:05:54,098 --> 00:05:56,902
{\an1}What can we possibly do
against an enemy like that?!

58
00:05:56,935 --> 00:05:59,871
{\an1}They're the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen, plus they can't die!

59
00:06:00,205 --> 00:06:02,775
{\an1}<i>The longer we fight,</i>
<i>the greater our</i>
<i>disadvantage.</i>

60
00:06:03,408 --> 00:06:04,877
Look, quit
worrying so much!

61
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:10,450
{\an1}The Reanimation Jutsu can still
be stopped by sealing away the
soul or immobilizing the body.

62
00:06:11,085 --> 00:06:13,754
{\an1}And other than Zabuza,
none of them have weapons.

63
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:16,724
{\an1}So that means all of them are
at half strength right now.

64
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:18,659
{\an1}No.

65
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:22,196
{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>It looks like they brought</i>
<i>their blades, all right.</i>

66
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,845
{\an1}But they're not
at full power.

67
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,346
{\an1}<i>[Guy]</i>
<i>The mist is getting thicker.</i>

68
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:39,950
Visibility is gone.

69
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:44,088
{\an1}And there isn't any sound
with Silent Killing.
So we can't even hear them.

70
00:06:44,388 --> 00:06:48,191
{\an1}We must get rid of this mist,
or our forces will be at a
disadvantage.

71
00:06:48,226 --> 00:06:49,994
Do you have a plan
to get rid of it?

72
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:52,163
{\an1}I'm preparing
one as we speak.

73
00:06:52,363 --> 00:06:54,198
All right, then I'll
leave you to handle it.

74
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,512
Lee, you go after
Scorch Style!

75
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:07,313
{\an1}I'll take Explosion Style!

76
00:07:07,347 --> 00:07:08,214
{\an1}Understood!

77
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:13,219
{\an1}Captain Kakashi!
Shadow Possession and
Shadow Paralysis ready!

78
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:15,157
Good, then
fasten it to me.

79
00:07:17,092 --> 00:07:20,394
{\an4}Ensui, I need you to
start by following my
moves with a loose Shadow
Posssession Jutsu, okay?

80
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:21,430
Right!

81
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:27,036
Santa Yamanaka, use your
Mind Transfer Jutsu to
trade places with me.

82
00:07:27,235 --> 00:07:31,607
{\an4}With your sensory skills,
you should be able to
track and find Zabuza,
even in this mist!

83
00:07:31,874 --> 00:07:32,408
{\an1}Got it!

84
00:07:34,677 --> 00:07:39,616
{\an4}<i>Once you locate Zabuza,</i>
<i>Santa, Ensui will get my</i>
<i>body within visual range</i>
<i>using Shadow Possession.</i>

85
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,153
{\an1}<i>Get me behind him</i>
<i>as close as you can.</i>

86
00:07:42,686 --> 00:07:48,159
{\an1}<i>Santa, once you see Zabuza,</i>
<i>release the Mind Transfer</i>
<i>Jutsu to return my body to me.</i>

87
00:07:50,162 --> 00:07:53,799
{\an1}<i>While fighting Zabuza,</i>
<i>I'll step on his shadow</i>
<i>to connect it to mine.</i>

88
00:07:55,134 --> 00:08:00,941
{\an4}<i>At that point, Ensui, you'll</i>
<i>immediately power up Shadow</i>
<i>Possession and Shadow Stitching</i>
<i>Jutsu in order to bind him. </i>

89
00:08:02,142 --> 00:08:06,747
{\an1}<i>Then Maki, completely</i>
<i>immobilize Zabuza with your</i>
<i>Cloth Paralysis Jutsu!</i>

90
00:08:07,247 --> 00:08:08,116
<i>[Maki]</i>
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

91
00:08:08,648 --> 00:08:09,316
Let's do it!

92
00:08:09,784 --> 00:08:10,084
Right!

93
00:08:10,818 --> 00:08:12,320
{\an1}Mind Transfer Jutsu!

94
00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:15,356
Now! The rest of us will
guard Captain Kakashi!

95
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:15,857
{\an1}Yeah!

96
00:08:20,996 --> 00:08:23,465
{\an1}<i>[Suigetsu]</i>
<i>Anyway, there are lots</i>
<i>of other blades, too.</i>

97
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:25,634
And throughout
all of history,

98
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:29,372
{\an1}there have been Ninja
Swordsmen other than only
Kisame, Zabuza, and Chojuro,

99
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:31,108
who have wielded
those blades.

100
00:08:31,374 --> 00:08:32,109
The first one,

101
00:08:34,444 --> 00:08:39,984
{\an4}<i>With the sharpest cutting edge</i>
<i>and swathed in lightning is the</i>
<i>Lightning Blade the Fang, "Kiba"</i>
<i>and its wielder Ameyuri Ringo.</i>

102
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:45,957
{\an1}<i>And the wielder of</i>
<i>the Blunt Blade,</i>

103
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:51,731
{\an1}<i>the Helmet-Splitter,</i>
<i>"Kabutowari" that smashes</i>
<i>through any defense,</i>

104
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,398
<i>Jinin Akebino.</i>

105
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,703
{\an1}<i>Stabbing and piercing</i>
<i>through anything,</i>

106
00:08:58,504 --> 00:08:59,740
{\an1}<i>and sewing them together,</i>

107
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,144
{\an1}<i>is the Long Blade, the</i>
<i>Sewing Needle, "Nuibari",</i>

108
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:06,981
<i>and its wielder</i>
<i>Kushimaru Kuriarare.</i>

109
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,820
{\an1}<i>Adding the power of</i>
<i>explosion to swordsmanship,</i>

110
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:16,357
{\an1}<i>The Explosive Blade,</i>
<i>the Spatter, "Shibuki",</i>

111
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:18,561
{\an1}<i>and its wielder</i>
<i>Jinpachi Munashi.</i>

112
00:09:22,832 --> 00:09:28,171
{\an1}<i>Next, just like Kisame</i>
<i>Hoshigaki, a previous wielder</i>
<i>of the Great Blade Shark Skin,</i>

113
00:09:28,205 --> 00:09:31,275
{\an1}<i>"Samehada" Fuguki Suikazan.</i>

114
00:09:31,508 --> 00:09:38,649
{\an4}<i>And he who could handle all</i>
<i>seven blades, the man known as</i>
<i>the second coming of the demon,</i>
<i>my older brother.</i>

115
00:09:38,683 --> 00:09:40,518
<i>Mangetsu Hozuki.</i>

116
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:42,587
So hopefully,

117
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:48,261
{\an4}If I have my way, I'll
get to become captain of
the new generation of the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen.

118
00:09:48,294 --> 00:09:48,794
And then--

119
00:09:48,827 --> 00:09:49,761
{\an1}<i>Enough.</i>

120
00:09:49,795 --> 00:09:52,098
{\an1}You're talking
too loudly, and
far too much.

121
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:54,934
Aw, come on! I was
just about to get
to the best part!

122
00:09:55,602 --> 00:09:58,839
{\an1}But the sword you were carrying
around is broken, anyway!

123
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,576
{\an1}Why don't you just get a
new one, or make a new
one for that matter.

124
00:10:02,943 --> 00:10:05,347
{\an1}You have no idea what
you're talking about, Jugo.

125
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:08,116
{\an1}you know that blade has
a very special ability!

126
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:14,190
{\an1}<i>The Severing Sword, the</i>
<i>Executioner's Blade, cannot</i>
<i>be chipped or nicked.</i>

127
00:10:14,223 --> 00:10:17,392
{\an1}<i>A better way to put is</i>
<i>that it can heal itself.</i>

128
00:10:17,425 --> 00:10:20,429
{\an1}<i>as it slices up people</i>
<i>and absorbs their blood.</i>

129
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,634
{\an1}<i>It uses the iron it takes</i>
<i>in to regenerate itself!</i>

130
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:28,705
{\an7}<i>Found him!</i>
<i>Mind Transfer</i>
<i>Jutsu, release!</i>

131
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,675
{\an7}<i>Good luck, Captain Kakashi!</i>

132
00:10:32,676 --> 00:10:35,146
{\an7}<i>Nice. He hasn't noticed me.</i>
<i>I got him!</i>

133
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:56,337
[chuckle]
Well done, Haku.

134
00:10:57,504 --> 00:11:00,374
{\an7}<i>The boy threw himself</i>
<i>in front of my attack!</i>

135
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:05,147
{\an7}<i>He saved your worthless life,</i>
<i>at the cost of his own.</i>

136
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:12,554
{\an7}<i>Zabuza's Hidden Mist style</i>

<i>battle of numbers.</i>

137
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,725
{\an8}<i>So I knew that Zabuza</i>
<i>would be their target.</i>

138
00:11:16,491 --> 00:11:18,928
{\an7}<i>The rest can just be</i>
<i>shields to defend him.</i>

139
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:23,566
{\an7}<i>And of course Haku will</i>
<i>protect Zabuza as if his</i>
<i>life depends upon it.</i>

140
00:11:24,168 --> 00:11:25,501
[chuckle]

141
00:11:25,703 --> 00:11:27,671
{\an7}<i>Even though he's</i>
<i>just a puppet now.</i>

142
00:11:27,705 --> 00:11:32,344
{\an7}<i>I bet it's turning out to be</i>
<i>quite an interesting production</i>
<i>out there on the battlefield.</i>

143
00:11:34,846 --> 00:11:37,482
{\an7}<i>He'd hack right through</i>
<i>the boy to take me down?</i>

144
00:11:42,321 --> 00:11:43,622
{\an1}Captain Kakashi, no!

145
00:12:01,776 --> 00:12:02,543
Agh!

146
00:12:08,784 --> 00:12:09,651
Yagh!

147
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:14,124
Huagh!

148
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,817
{\an1}Damn it. How do we fight
the enemy if we can't
see or hear them?!

149
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:40,753
Isn't Captain
Kakashi here yet?!

150
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,658
{\an1}I've got the shadow
of one enemy!

151
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,063
But there hasn't been
enough contact time
with the second one!

152
00:12:49,296 --> 00:12:51,098
So I can't freeze
his movements yet!

153
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:52,933
{\an1}There hasn't been
enough contact time?!

154
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:56,004
{\an1}You mean that
Zabuza has cut down
Captain Kakashi?!

155
00:13:06,415 --> 00:13:07,183
Kakashi
Sensei!

156
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,019
I really wanna
go on another
A-rank mission!

157
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,456
{\an1}Oh, no. Not a chance.

158
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:18,228
{\an4}I still can't believe that we
all made it through safe and
sound against such powerful
enemies as Zabuza and Haku.

159
00:13:19,564 --> 00:13:20,764
Aww.

160
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:24,268
{\an1}Listen, don't worry,
you're going to get
to A-Rank eventually,

161
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:27,506
{\an1}after you learn more
jutsu and do some
training to get stronger.

162
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:28,773
I guess so.

163
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,210
You're right about
learning more jutsu.

164
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,813
But I've also got to
find more things I
want to protect.

165
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:35,848
{\an1}Hm?

166
00:13:36,748 --> 00:13:38,885
It was something that
Haku said to me.

167
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:42,355
{\an1}He told me that when people
are protecting something that
is truly precious to them,

168
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,958
{\an1}that's when they can
become genuinely stronger.

169
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:51,031
{\an1}I see. And you agree
with him, do you?

170
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:56,670
{\an1}You bet! After watching Haku
with Zabuza, I know he's right!

171
00:13:58,406 --> 00:13:59,107
{\an1}[chuckle]

172
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,110
Hey, um, wait a second,
Kakashi Sensei.

173
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,313
Tell me something.
What do you think?

174
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:05,848
{\an1}About what?

175
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:42,557
{\an1}I'm glad that you two were
Naruto's first adversaries.

176
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:57,306
{\an1}Maki, until I give the signal,
stay behind me. Get the Cloth
Paralysis Jutsu ready!

177
00:14:57,339 --> 00:14:58,006
{\an1}Yes, sir!

178
00:15:03,845 --> 00:15:07,016
[panting]

179
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:10,421
{\an8}<i>Why? Why can't I</i>
<i>keep up with him?</i>

180
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:12,890
Haaaaah!

181
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:25,538
I knew you didn't
have what it takes
for the long haul.

182
00:15:26,004 --> 00:15:26,938
{\an1}What did you say?

183
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:31,577
<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>You have no idea what</i>
<i>real strength is.</i>

184
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:40,954
{\an1}Zabuza. you hesitated in
slicing through Haku
that day on the bridge.

185
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:45,460
{\an1}You simply couldn't hide
the unrest in your heart
over Haku's death.

186
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:54,069
{\an5}But things are
different today.
You're just an
emotionless tool.

187
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:56,939
{\an1}So let's just get this
senseless fight over with!

188
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,145
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Hey, um, wait a second,</i>
<i>Kakashi Sensei.</i>

189
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:04,447
{\an1}<i>Tell me something.</i>
<i>What do you think?</i>

190
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:06,751
{\an1}About what?

191
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:10,521
Well. I know that
those two were our
enemies and all.

192
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:14,058
{\an1}But you know what?
Actually...

193
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:16,294
Well, I...

194
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:18,996
{\an1}I kinda liked those guys!

195
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:20,666
Huh?

196
00:16:22,602 --> 00:16:24,771
{\an1}What is it? Is that
weird or something?

197
00:16:27,206 --> 00:16:28,408
{\an1}Heh heh heh heh.

198
00:16:30,543 --> 00:16:31,177
<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>No.</i>

199
00:16:33,547 --> 00:16:35,115
{\an1}<i>I feel the same way.</i>

200
00:16:45,393 --> 00:16:46,828
{\an1}Ensui! Bind him!

201
00:16:47,062 --> 00:16:48,731
{\an7}<i>That's my signal!</i>
<i>All right!</i>

202
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,533
{\an7}<i>Shadow Paralysis Jutsu!</i>

203
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:03,113
{\an7}<i>The way you died</i>
<i>and your tears.</i>

204
00:17:12,557 --> 00:17:15,226
{\an1}<i>They demonstrated your</i>
<i>bond to each other.</i>

205
00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:19,798
{\an7}<i>As a shinobi, I've got</i>
<i>plenty to protect, too.</i>

206
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:25,971
{\an7}<i>Protecting the way that</i>
<i>Zabuza and Haku died,</i>
<i>is one of those things.</i>

207
00:17:27,073 --> 00:17:33,079
{\an1}<i>Especially since I was-</i>
<i>and am again-</i>
<i>their final enemy.</i>

208
00:17:45,227 --> 00:17:48,664
{\an1}<i>Naruto. What do you think?</i>

209
00:17:58,307 --> 00:17:59,376
Now, Maki!
Do it!

210
00:17:59,777 --> 00:18:00,444
{\an1}Right!

211
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:03,715
Mh!

212
00:18:06,216 --> 00:18:07,151
{\an8}<i>Damn it!</i>

213
00:18:08,219 --> 00:18:09,587
Look!
Is it...?

214
00:18:10,688 --> 00:18:12,357
{\an1}Yeah! The mist
is clearing up!

215
00:18:13,391 --> 00:18:15,394
Yes! We can see
the enemy now!

216
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:21,233
{\an1}<i>[Maki]</i>
<i>As long as these tags remain,</i>
<i>they can't be summoned.</i>

217
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,604
And I will watch over
these two personally!

218
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:26,038
{\an1}All right.

219
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:30,143
This jutsu.
It really is
unforgivable!

220
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:34,047
{\an1}Sai, next up we'll use the
Foundation's Sealing Jutsu.

221
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,416
So follow me!

222
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,286
{\an1}But Kakashi, I haven't
mastered that jutsu yet.

223
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,189
{\an1}Isn't it true that Danzo
valued you very highly, Sai?

224
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,793
You don't have
to suppress your
emotions now!

225
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:50,500
Well, It takes a quite
lot for me to lose my
temper too, you know.

226
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:54,103
{\an1}But after this mess,
I've reached my boiling point.

227
00:18:55,038 --> 00:19:00,678
{\an1}I'm Kakashi the Copy Ninja;
I know a thousand jutsu.
And now, I'll use them all,

228
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:02,580
{\an1}And live up to my name!

229
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,448
Attack!

230
00:19:04,482 --> 00:19:06,551
Haaaa!

{\an1}Eight Trigrams Palm Rotation!

235
00:19:34,682 --> 00:19:36,017
Agh!

236
00:19:37,953 --> 00:19:39,153
No! He's got Neji!

237
00:19:39,922 --> 00:19:42,591
{\an1}Egh! There are
just too many of them!

238
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,862
And they absorb
chakra, too.

239
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:51,268
{\an1}Gentle Fist Technique!

240
00:19:51,868 --> 00:19:52,837
Body Blow!

241
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,587
{\an1}They just keep coming!
There's no end to these guys!

242
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,489
{\an1}Quit whining!
And move!

243
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,292
These forces are so
strong and persistent!

244
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:16,329
This is going to be
a war of attrition.

245
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:21,735
{\an1}Captain Kitsuchi!
There's a message from HQ!

246
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:25,506
{\an1}Several thousand of the
enemy soldiers have
apparently gotten past us!

247
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:26,407
Dad, we
gotta--!

248
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,009
Be quiet!
I know!

249
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:08,454
{\an1}Here they come now.

{\an1}<i>[Ao]</i>
<i>Who are those two shinobi?!</i>
