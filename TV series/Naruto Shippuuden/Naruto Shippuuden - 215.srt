00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:13,382
{\an1}Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

3
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:17,886
{\an1}How about it, Kakashi? Can
your borrowed Sharingan
extinguish power like this?!

4
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:21,623
{\an1}Now I'll show you the
difference between the
real thing and a fake!

5
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:25,694
Nngh...
Augh!

6
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:26,827
Huh.

7
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:31,533
Yagh!

8
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:33,601
{\an5}Damn it!

9
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,377
{\an8}<i>No! My sight!</i>

10
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:50,784
{\an7}<i>Sakura! Why are you here?!</i>

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,454
Don't!

12
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,590
{\an7}<i>I won't let Kakashi Sensei</i>
<i>bear this burden!</i>

13
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:03,796
{\an1}I'm not the same as you.
I'm traveling a path the
rest of you can't follow.

14
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,932
{\an1}I know that the four of
us have worked together,

15
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:10,502
{\an1}And for a while, I
thought I could take
that road instead.

16
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:14,206
{\an1}<i>But in the end,</i>
<i>I've decided on revenge.</i>

17
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,843
{\an1}<i>That's always been my</i>
<i>reason for living.</i>

18
00:01:18,543 --> 00:01:21,278
{\an1}Sakura, I will never be
like you and Naruto.

19
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,783
I'll do anything
for you, Sasuke!
So please...

20
00:01:25,816 --> 00:01:27,951
<i>I'm begging you,</i>
<i>don't walk away!!</i>

21
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,256
{\an1}I'll even help get your revenge!
I'll do whatever it takes to
make it happen, I swear!

22
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:36,794
<i>So stay here...</i>
<i>with me...</i>

23
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,495
<i>And if you can't,</i>

24
00:01:38,796 --> 00:01:40,964
{\an1}<i>Then take me with you, Sasuke!</i>

25
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:43,066
[sobs]

26
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:45,201
{\an1}You haven't changed.

27
00:01:45,802 --> 00:01:47,169
{\an1}You're still annoying.

28
00:01:47,202 --> 00:01:48,270
[gasp]

29
00:01:49,905 --> 00:01:50,973
Don't leave me!

30
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,409
If you go,
I'll scream and--

31
00:01:55,177 --> 00:01:55,845
{\an3}[gasp]

32
00:01:59,748 --> 00:02:00,549
Sakura...

33
00:02:02,984 --> 00:02:04,152
Thanks for
everything.

34
00:02:08,122 --> 00:02:08,791
{\an1}Sakura!

35
00:02:10,124 --> 00:02:11,125
A-Aah!

36
00:02:13,628 --> 00:02:14,862
Sasuke! Don't!

37
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:57,982
Two Fates

38
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:08,825
{\an1}You've got even better
timing than I do, Naruto.

39
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:12,596
{\an1}I never imagined you'd
come here, but it's a
good thing you did.

40
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:13,930
{\an1}You're a lifesaver!

41
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:17,166
{\an1}Yeah. Thank you, Naruto.

42
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,441
{\an7}<i>[Sakura]</i>
<i>Sasuke... really tried</i>
<i>to kill me just then.</i>

43
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:29,611
{\an7}<i>[Sakura]</i>
<i>If Naruto hadn't come,</i>
<i>I'd be dead now.</i>

44
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:32,246
{\an7}<i>[Sakura]</i>
<i>By Sasuke's hand.</i>

45
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:41,154
Sasuke, c'mon.

46
00:05:41,756 --> 00:05:44,558
{\an1}Sakura's a comrade from
Team 7, remember?!

47
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:49,196
{\an1}You mean former comrade.
I'm off your team.

48
00:05:50,464 --> 00:05:53,333
Now do you understand,
Naruto? Sakura?

49
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:56,369
{\an1}<i>His intent to kill</i>
<i>is undeniable.</i>

50
00:05:57,938 --> 00:06:00,139
{\an1}<i>Sasuke is no longer the</i>
<i>person we once knew.</i>

51
00:06:23,328 --> 00:06:24,262
Listen, Sasuke.

52
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:26,564
{\an1}What do you want?

53
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:31,535
{\an1}I know the truth about
Itachi. That guy Tobi
told me everything.

54
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:32,737
Huh?

55
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:36,640
{\an8}<i>The truth about Itachi?</i>

56
00:06:37,975 --> 00:06:42,846
Then again, maybe he was
lying. I guess I can't
really know for sure.

57
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:46,616
{\an1}<i>But it doesn't matter.</i>
<i>What you've been doing,</i>

58
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:50,020
I get it, Sasuke.

59
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:50,887
Huh?

60
00:06:59,162 --> 00:07:00,295
Naruto.

61
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,066
{\an1}Just like I told you before,

62
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:08,737
{\an1}You never had a family or
siblings in the first place.
You couldn't possibly "get it",

63
00:07:10,605 --> 00:07:13,008
{\an1}<i>So all you outsiders</i>
<i>can just shut up!!</i>

64
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,211
{\an1}Do you know what Naruto
has gone through for you?

65
00:07:17,946 --> 00:07:22,017
No matter what we hear
you've done, he still
considers you a comrade.

66
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:29,490
{\an1}When everyone wanted to turn on
you, Naruto alone stood up for
you and wanted to rescue you.

67
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:31,025
Even now...

68
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:33,493
{\an1}Rescue me?

69
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,495
{\an1}From what?

70
00:07:37,363 --> 00:07:38,565
Oh. Well, from--

71
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:41,601
{\an1}From revenge, Sasuke.

72
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:42,736
{\an1}Huh?

73
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:49,541
{\an1}I swear I'll save you from
revenge and from all of the
chaos that it causes.

74
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,310
Heh!

75
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,512
{\an1}But I don't want you to do that.

76
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:57,382
{\an1}The stage has already been
set for my vengeance!

77
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,217
{\an1}Huh?
Huh?
Huh?

78
00:07:59,518 --> 00:08:00,986
Not long ago...

79
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,257
{\an1}I finally got my revenge
on the one behind
Itachi's betrayal.

80
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:15,233
{\an1}How many Uchiha did you
have to kill to get that
right arm of yours?!

81
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,202
{\an1}It was all thanks to Itachi.

82
00:08:18,603 --> 00:08:20,071
{\an1}You made him do it!

83
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:26,009
Agh!

84
00:08:26,943 --> 00:08:29,246
{\an1}It's a Reverse Tetragram
Sealing Jutsu!

85
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:31,848
{\an1}Sasuke! Get away from Danzo!

86
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,100
{\an1}I took down a high-ranking
Hidden Leaf elder right here.

87
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:53,202
{\an1}The one called Danzo.

88
00:08:53,969 --> 00:08:54,736
[gasp]

89
00:08:55,937 --> 00:08:59,941
{\an7}<i>What?! Sasuke killed Danzo?!</i>
<i>All by himself?</i>

90
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:03,144
I 've never felt
like this before.

91
00:09:04,012 --> 00:09:06,881
{\an1}I can feel the tainted Uchiha
name becoming cleansed.

92
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:12,386
{\an1}<i>I feel the Uchiha at last</i>
<i>being freed from this</i>
<i>rotting Shinobi world.</i>

93
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,155
{\an1}<i>You couldn't even begin</i>
<i>to understand it.</i>

94
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:21,561
{\an1}<i>And besides, isn't what I'm</i>
<i>doing exactly what you Leaf</i>
<i>Shinobi have wanted all along? </i>

95
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:25,898
{\an1}<i>You've always snubbed and</i>
<i>put down the Uchiha clan.</i>

96
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:29,402
{\an1}So I'll simply help
erase the Uchiha
from your memories,

97
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,838
{\an1}By killing all of you.

98
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:34,006
{\an1}<i>And then destroying...</i>

99
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,474
{\an1}The Hidden Leaf Village!

100
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:44,449
{\an1}Severing all bonds with
the Hidden Leaf will be
the ultimate purification!

101
00:09:45,116 --> 00:09:48,787
{\an1}And that shall lead to the
Uchiha's true restoration!

102
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:51,455
My god, Sasuke.

103
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,426
{\an7}<i>Hatred. The cycle of</i>
<i>hatred begetting hatred.</i>

104
00:09:55,826 --> 00:09:58,296
{\an7}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>That's what created</i>
<i>the Sasuke before us.</i>

105
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:04,635
{\an7}<i>They may not realize it,</i>
<i>but Naruto and Sakura are</i>
<i>seeing with their own eyes</i>

106
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:07,938
{\an7}<i>that Sasuke is a victim</i>
<i>of the times we live in.</i>

107
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:10,506
{\an7}<i>Which is especially why,</i>

108
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:34,763
{\an7}<i>This is my responsibility.</i>

109
00:10:48,442 --> 00:10:51,279
{\an1}Naruto, Sakura.
Go on, get out
of here.

110
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:53,781
{\an1}Kakashi Sensei! No!

111
00:10:54,414 --> 00:10:58,652
{\an1}If you stay, you'll see things
you'll wish you hadn't.
Now go!

112
00:10:59,186 --> 00:10:59,953
Sensei, I--

113
00:11:01,588 --> 00:11:05,659
{\an1}Sakura, the poison-laced
kunai Shizune taught you how
to use won't kill Sasuke.

114
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:08,895
{\an1}He still has Orochimaru's
immunity to poison.

115
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:12,665
{\an1}What's more, you also
know how you feel.

116
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:23,809
No, Sasuke!

117
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:28,314
{\an1}I know I just healed you,
but you shouldn't...

118
00:11:28,347 --> 00:11:29,148
Ngh!

119
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:32,184
{\an1}You can't withstand
another battle yet!

120
00:11:34,786 --> 00:11:36,554
{\an1}Please, Sasuke...

121
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:41,359
{\an1}Don't move, Karin. Hold still.

122
00:11:57,807 --> 00:12:00,943
{\an7}<i>He hit a vital point...</i>
<i>right through the hostage?!</i>

123
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:05,047
{\an1}[chuckle] Now that's my boy.

124
00:12:05,982 --> 00:12:07,183
One down...

125
00:12:08,384 --> 00:12:10,219
{\an1}Soon the rest, big brother.

126
00:12:13,255 --> 00:12:18,760
{\an7}<i>Actually, what am I saying?</i>
<i>Why should I still care</i>
<i>about Sasuke?</i>

127
00:12:39,913 --> 00:12:43,350
{\an5}Kakashi Sensei,
This "something"
you don't want
us to see...

128
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:45,285
Are you going
to kill Sasuke?

129
00:12:48,088 --> 00:12:49,689
{\an1}Go! Both of you!

130
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:58,798
{\an1}Now's my chance!
And I'm not going
to hold back!

131
00:12:58,831 --> 00:12:59,731
{\an1}Wait, Naruto!

132
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:07,105
Naruto!

133
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,049
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>You know, Sasuke...</i>

134
00:13:56,185 --> 00:13:57,585
{\an1}<i>...there's a chance...</i>

135
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,691
{\an1}<i>...our roles could</i>
<i>have been reversed.</i>

136
00:14:18,072 --> 00:14:22,042
{\an4}<i>[Itachi]</i>
<i>By all means, flee.</i>
<i>Cling to your</i>
<i>wretched life.</i>

137
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:25,612
{\an1}And one day, when you
possess the same eyes.

138
00:14:25,812 --> 00:14:27,114
{\an1}Come back and face me!

139
00:14:51,203 --> 00:14:52,371
Rasengan!
Chidori!

140
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:25,435
Sasuke, you remember,
don't you?

141
00:15:26,403 --> 00:15:30,106
Back in the day,
The entire Village
used to hate me.

142
00:15:31,407 --> 00:15:34,776
{\an1}<i>Because of the Nine-Tails</i>
<i>that's inside of me.</i>

143
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:38,147
<i>And I hated</i>
<i>them right</i>
<i>back.</i>

144
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,252
{\an1}I thought about getting
revenge on everyone, too.

145
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:50,625
And keep wiping until
every speck of that
graffiti is gone!

146
00:15:51,426 --> 00:15:53,662
Look, it's that...
that kid.

147
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:57,131
Why do they even let
that boy stay in the
Village, anyway?

148
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,234
{\an1}Lord Hokage should have
more consideration for us!

149
00:16:00,768 --> 00:16:01,602
{\an1}Shut up!

150
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,305
Haaa!

151
00:16:04,737 --> 00:16:05,439
{\an1}Hmm?

152
00:16:06,106 --> 00:16:07,308
{\an1}Hey, you little brat!

153
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:08,576
{\an1}Get outta here!

154
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:11,211
Hmf!

155
00:16:11,244 --> 00:16:13,279
{\an1}Hey, what's the
big idea, buddy?!

156
00:16:14,747 --> 00:16:15,949
{\an1}Here, is this
what you want?!

157
00:16:16,316 --> 00:16:16,650
Ah!

158
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:21,753
{\an1}Then just take it and get lost!
And don't come back!

159
00:16:25,924 --> 00:16:28,860
{\an1}There it is again!
I don't understand it.

160
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:32,531
{\an1}Everybody, even you,
my own teacher.

161
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:36,201
{\an1}Why does everybody look at me
like that all of the time?!

162
00:16:37,902 --> 00:16:41,206
{\an1}I'm not just a nuisance or some
kind of germ; I'm a person, too!

163
00:16:41,906 --> 00:16:43,007
I am!

164
00:16:43,642 --> 00:16:46,077
{\an1}I'm Naruto Uzumaki!
Don't forget it!

165
00:16:56,753 --> 00:17:02,392
{\an1}One bad move, and I could
have been like you, and
devised some terrible plan.

166
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:09,466
{\an1}I used to think I didn't have
any bonds with anyone, either.

167
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:13,570
{\an1}Till I met you and
Iruka Sensei as well.

168
00:17:14,303 --> 00:17:16,905
{\an1}[kids giggling and playing]

169
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:20,309
{\an1}<i>Daichi! Dinnertime!</i>

170
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,844
<i>Let's go home,</i>
<i>everyone.</i>

171
00:17:23,245 --> 00:17:24,046
<i>Mom!</i>

172
00:17:26,749 --> 00:17:30,184
{\an5}What do you think
you're doing?
I told you not to
play with that boy.

173
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:31,452
Come on, let's go!

174
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:06,686
Hmf!

175
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:30,508
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Oh, I'll tell you
who's really lying.

176
00:18:32,577 --> 00:18:36,180
They've been lying
to you your whole
life, Naruto.

177
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:38,549
Since the decree
12 years ago.

178
00:18:39,283 --> 00:18:40,651
{\an1}What decree is that?

179
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:42,852
Everyone knows it!

180
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:45,823
{\an5}Iruka's trying to hide
it from you even now.
He'd do anything to
shut me up!

181
00:18:46,122 --> 00:18:49,693
{\an1}What is this decree?
Why does everyone
else know about it?

182
00:18:52,228 --> 00:18:54,063
The decree is:

183
00:18:54,097 --> 00:18:57,367
{\an1}no one can tell you the
Nine-Tailed Fox is inside you!

184
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,368
[gasp]

185
00:19:00,336 --> 00:19:03,740
{\an4}The Fox Spirit that
killed Iruka's parents
and destroyed our village
has taken over YOUR body!

186
00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:05,941
You are the
Nine-Tailed Fox!

187
00:19:07,242 --> 00:19:11,113
{\an1}<i>They've all been sneaking</i>
<i>around, hiding things from</i>
<i>you your whole life.</i>

188
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:14,882
{\an1}<i>Didn't you think it was</i>
<i>strange how they</i>
<i>treated you? Like dirt!</i>

189
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:17,552
{\an1}<i>Like they hated you</i>
<i>just for being alive?</i>

190
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:20,388
{\an1}That's why you'll never be
accepted in this village!

191
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:21,857
Die, Naruto!

192
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:25,126
{\an1}Naruto! Get down!

193
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,399
However...

194
00:19:37,937 --> 00:19:40,240
Nngh! Agh!

195
00:19:42,776 --> 00:19:43,810
{\an1}<i>Why?</i>

196
00:19:49,716 --> 00:19:52,752
[sniffle] I know how
you feel, Naruto.

197
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:57,955
{\an1}You feel lonely, and it hurts
inside. And I could have been
there for you more.

198
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:06,732
{\an4}[sniff] I let you down.
I'm sorry. No one should have
to suffer that much. No one
should be alone like that.

199
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:11,436
I almost gave in
to my despair.

200
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,174
{\an1}<i>But you and Iruka Sensei,</i>
<i>you saved me!</i>

201
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:20,711
{\an1}Back then, I always knew
that you were alone, too.

202
00:20:21,712 --> 00:20:25,917
I felt better knowing
there was someone like
you- like me- out there.

203
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,821
We were just brats,
but dealing with stuff
no other kid had to.

204
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:35,257
{\an1}Me, the Nine-Tails.
You, the fate of the Uchiha.

205
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:39,930
{\an1}We had such similar burdens.
Pretty ironic, huh?

206
00:20:42,398 --> 00:20:48,871
{\an4}<i>To be honest, nearly every</i>
<i>time I saw you, all I really</i>
<i>wanted to do was come up to</i>
<i>you and start talking.</i>

207
00:20:49,538 --> 00:20:55,143
{\an4}<i>I'd get sort of giddy.</i>
<i>Because I felt like</i>
<i>maybe you of all people</i>
<i>could understand me.</i>

208
00:20:55,643 --> 00:20:57,412
But I never did.

209
00:20:58,513 --> 00:20:59,848
'Cause I was jealous.

210
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:02,617
{\an1}You were so good
at everything!

211
00:21:03,585 --> 00:21:06,788
{\an1}<i>So I decided that instead,</i>
<i>I'd make you my rival!</i>

212
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:18,097
And, Sasuke,
From that day on,

213
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:20,434
<i>...you've been my goal.</i>

214
00:22:56,389 --> 00:23:01,361
{\an4}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Hey. Sasuke, do you remember</i>
<i>what you said to me long ago</i>
<i>at the Final Valley?</i>

215
00:23:02,228 --> 00:23:04,230
{\an1}<i>The thing about</i>
<i>high-level shinobi?</i>

216
00:23:05,031 --> 00:23:08,001
{\an1}<i>We learned things right now from</i>
<i>trading blows with each other.</i>

217
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:12,338
{\an1}<i>So, Sasuke. Can you tell me</i>
<i>what I'm thinking right now?</i>

218
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:14,841
{\an1}<i>Can you read my mind?</i>

219
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:19,345
{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>High-Level Shinobi.</i>

220
00:23:20,713 --> 00:23:22,681
{\an1}<i>[Sasuke]</i>
<i>Why are you so fixated on me?!</i>
