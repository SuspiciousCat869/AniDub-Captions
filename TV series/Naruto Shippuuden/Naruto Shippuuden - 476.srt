1
00:00:40,703 --> 00:00:42,005
Naruto.

2
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:47,111
{\an1}Sometimes your eyes
are even better than
mine.

3
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:51,483
Sasuke is in the
darkness.

4
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:59,592
{\an1}Now get going. You
are the only person
who can save him.

5
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,662
Uh huh.

6
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,866
{\an1}Trust me, I know that.

7
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:20,387
My view of being
Hokage  stands as my
response.

8
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,023
{\an1}Itachi's life path led
me to this answer.

9
00:03:23,323 --> 00:03:28,196
{\an1}In order to protect
the Land of Fire and
the Village,

10
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:31,299
{\an1}he sacrificed his clan and
himself

11
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:33,702
{\an1}So I first needed to
know why.

12
00:03:33,736 --> 00:03:38,874
{\an1}What is this Land and
Village that he would
go so far to protect?

13
00:03:38,907 --> 00:03:42,412
{\an1}The previous Hokage
said... that the

14
00:03:42,445 --> 00:03:44,748
{\an1}villiage is a framework
created to stop

15
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,250
{\an1}slaughter of many
clans and children...

16
00:03:47,284 --> 00:03:50,588
{\an1}...a framework that
was supposed to lead
to peace.

17
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:55,126
{\an1}Itachi was trying to
sustain that peace all
by himself.

18
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,195
{\an1}That's
what I finally came to

19
00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:58,797
understand...

20
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,868
{\an4}Suffering in darkness
as a criminal and
traitor to Land and
Village...

21
00:04:03,303 --> 00:04:06,839
{\an1}He was a shinobi who
took on all hatred...

22
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,512
{\an4}...and protected the
Land of Fire and the
Leaf Village from the
shadows.

23
00:04:11,545 --> 00:04:14,448
{\an1}I feel that he was the true
Hokage.

24
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:20,922
It's not the one
acknowledged by all,

25
00:04:20,955 --> 00:04:23,892
{\an1}but the one who
accepts all the hatred

26
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:25,795
{\an1}that is worthy of that
title.

27
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:28,331
{\an1}And... I eventually
came to understand

28
00:04:28,532 --> 00:04:31,601
{\an1}Itachi's feelings
for his Land and Village

29
00:04:31,802 --> 00:04:34,639
{\an1}But my brother made
one mistake.

30
00:04:34,838 --> 00:04:38,108
By
leaving me, his little
brother, alive

31
00:04:38,142 --> 00:04:40,878
{\an1}and being unable to hide
the truth from me,

32
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:43,081
{\an1}he allowed the hatred to
spread.

33
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:49,455
However, I'm not
like my Big Brother
anymore.

34
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:54,327
{\an4}I have no father,
mother, brother, not
even a single member
of my clan.

35
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,334
{\an1}Which means that I
am alone.

36
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,270
{\an1}I alone can bear the
weight

37
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:06,907
{\an1}of all the hatred in
the world now.

38
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:10,546
{\an1}And I alone will deal
with everything
personally.

39
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,750
{\an1}I will handle all of
the shinobi problems.

40
00:05:13,783 --> 00:05:18,321
I shall also
dispense all judgment
and punishment.

41
00:05:18,354 --> 00:05:21,525
{\an1}I'll concentrate all
hatred upon myself...

42
00:05:21,558 --> 00:05:24,962
and bring every
single village under my control.

43
00:05:25,262 --> 00:05:29,134
{\an1}Hatred inside darkness
can't be destroyed.

44
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:32,203
And so, I'd
rather...

45
00:05:37,276 --> 00:05:40,814
{\an1}To me... the Hokage
is someone...

46
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:42,616
{\an1}....who uses his own
flame...

47
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:45,653
{\an1}...to sear away the
darkness of the Five
Villages.

48
00:05:45,686 --> 00:05:48,689
{\an1}And then keeps on living by
eating the ashes.

49
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,258
{\an1}Do you really think
everyone'll sit back

50
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,795
and say, yes to
that?

51
00:05:52,828 --> 00:05:54,730
{\an1}I thought I told you
already...

52
00:05:54,763 --> 00:05:57,533
It doesn't
matter what any of you
think of me.

53
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:02,070
{\an1}And besides, I have the
power now to control
it all.

54
00:06:02,305 --> 00:06:04,207
You really don't
have any clue at all

55
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,876
{\an1}about how Itachi
lived!

56
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,079
{\an1}There are things you
can't do alone!

57
00:06:09,113 --> 00:06:11,917
Like our battle
against Kaguya,
remember?!

58
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:17,055
{\an1}But it doesn't always
go well...

59
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:19,958
{\an1}Like with
these two stone
statues.

60
00:06:20,258 --> 00:06:25,231
{\an1}And with... us two
brothers...

61
00:06:25,264 --> 00:06:27,233
{\an1}With revolution, the
villages

62
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:30,671
{\an1}will no
longer have to bear
darkness. I will

63
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:32,807
{\an1}become the one and
only darkness.

64
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:35,743
{\an1}I'll dispose of the
deep darkness of the
past

65
00:06:35,777 --> 00:06:39,080
and build a pure
white future from scratch.

66
00:06:39,113 --> 00:06:41,216
{\an1}You mean by killing
the Tailed Beasts

67
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:44,086
{\an1}and taking down all of
the Five Kage, too?!

68
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:45,621
That's right.

69
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:48,959
{\an1}I'm going to cast
off the past.

70
00:06:50,227 --> 00:06:51,261
{\an1}You're saying you
can pretend like

71
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:53,363
{\an1}nothing ever happened
with Itachi? Yeah, right!

72
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:55,031
{\an1}Give me a
break!

73
00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:56,199
{\an1}You and Itachi were
brothers,

74
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,336
and a lot
happened between you
two!

75
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:00,338
{\an1}That's what made you who you are
today!

76
00:07:00,371 --> 00:07:04,243
{\an1}As of now, Itachi is
entirely in my past.

77
00:07:04,276 --> 00:07:06,211
I'm cutting ties
with all past mistakes

78
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:09,516
and doubts here and
starting anew.

79
00:07:09,549 --> 00:07:12,652
{\an1}I'm going to begin by
cutting you down.

80
00:07:12,685 --> 00:07:15,923
{\an1}Your blood will be the
last that I shed

81
00:07:15,956 --> 00:07:18,292
{\an1}in
the memory of my late
brother.

82
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:24,766
I won't

83
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:28,004
{\an1}...let you! I learned
everything I know from

84
00:07:28,036 --> 00:07:30,238
{\an1}the people of my past!
Especially about how

85
00:07:30,272 --> 00:07:34,176
{\an1}to figure out what to
do after making a
mistake!

86
00:07:35,244 --> 00:07:38,782
{\an1}You said that you
consider Sasuke a
brother.

87
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:42,687
{\an1}That's why I know
you can stop him,
Naruto.

88
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,889
{\an1}Only you can
do it.

89
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:47,927
{\an1}You'll have to take
care of Sasuke.

90
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,260
{\an1}That's the reason!

91
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:52,531
{\an1}...why I won't let
you kill me.

92
00:08:02,242 --> 00:08:03,577
Lord Sage!

93
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:06,480
{\an1}It seems that it's
almost time.

94
00:08:06,514 --> 00:08:07,848
{\an1}So what should...?

95
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,218
What should I be
doing, sir?

96
00:08:11,252 --> 00:08:14,088
Just continue to
maintain faith.

97
00:08:14,122 --> 00:08:17,159
That
is the only thing we
can do right now.

98
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:31,241
{\an1}What you do and what
shall transpire,

99
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:34,613
{\an1}will be up to the two
of you from here on.

100
00:08:34,646 --> 00:08:37,783
{\an1}You know, Sasuke and
I...  we may not be
real brothers,

101
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,285
but I
believe that we can make peace.

102
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:44,657
{\an1}Now that Itachi's
gone, I finally feel
truly alone.

103
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,695
{\an1}But there's still
Naruto. He's the
one person

104
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,530
{\an1}that I
have to cut down.

105
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:53,534
{\an1}My version of the
Hokage can only exist

106
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:55,870
{\an1}by severing all ties
and being alone.

107
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,205
Why is that?

108
00:08:57,238 --> 00:08:58,640
Because

109
00:08:58,673 --> 00:09:00,843
{\an1}And that's because, to
me...

110
00:09:00,876 --> 00:09:02,211
{\an1}we're pretty good
friends.

111
00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:06,281
{\an1}...Naruto is still who
I'd call my closest
friend.

112
00:09:12,222 --> 00:09:18,295
Naruto, Sasuke,
Show me your answer.

113
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:21,365
Show me the
shinobi's answer!

114
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,121
Inferno Style:
Honoikazuchi!

115
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:47,066
(battle cry)

116
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:02,183
(inhale)

117
00:12:12,128 --> 00:12:13,096
(gasp)

118
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:14,496
{\an1}His left eye is...

119
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,141
(grunt)

120
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:46,738
(battle cry)

121
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:50,609
(batle cry)

122
00:14:58,017 --> 00:15:00,854
{\an1}You were on your own
right from the
beginning!

123
00:15:00,888 --> 00:15:02,856
You don't know
anything ABOUT it!

124
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,726
{\an1}I'm suffering 'cause
I HAVE those ties.

125
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:08,329
{\an1}How on earth could you
possibly understand

126
00:15:08,363 --> 00:15:11,367
{\an1}what it feels like to
lose all that?!

127
00:15:14,503 --> 00:15:15,304
(grunt)

128
00:15:42,102 --> 00:15:45,105
{\an1}What's wrong? You're
just gonna play
defense?

129
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,112
(angry roar)

130
00:15:53,114 --> 00:15:54,983
(yelling effort)

131
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:28,588
(grunting)

132
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,320
{\an1}If you keep stalling,
you'll eventually
die.

133
00:16:56,719 --> 00:17:00,559
(grunting)

134
00:17:01,058 --> 00:17:03,395
{\an1}I don't wanna kill
you!

135
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:06,599
{\an1}But one thing was
worthwhile

136
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:09,167
{\an1}The two of us became
best friends.

137
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:12,638
{\an1}You're trying to be
alone again...

138
00:17:12,672 --> 00:17:14,474
{\an1}...but I'm not letting
you do that!

139
00:17:17,144 --> 00:17:20,648
{\an1}Especially since we
both know what
that's like!

140
00:17:20,682 --> 00:17:21,748
{\an1}That's why I can't let you...

141
00:17:28,389 --> 00:17:31,994
(attacking roar)

142
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:35,097
{\an1}...go to that place
intentionally!

143
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:13,807
{\an1}Just quit all your
yapping.

144
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:16,978
{\an1}We're both different
from the two boys

145
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,080
{\an1}who fought here long
ago...

146
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:22,985
{\an1}I know your heart well
by now...

147
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:26,390
{\an1}...and you, mine.
Right, Naruto?

148
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:29,727
{\an1}And yet, for some
reason, you still
wanna fight me?

149
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:32,029
{\an1}Especially because
it's you.

150
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,133
{\an1}I need to cut you out
of my life.

151
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:38,202
{\an1}There's no guarantee
that the world
you're going to rebuild

152
00:18:38,236 --> 00:18:40,805
{\an1}after you go severing the past

153
00:18:40,838 --> 00:18:44,376
{\an1}won't end up just
like this one again,
you know.

154
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:48,048
{\an1}That's the reason
why I'll keep watch
over that world.

155
00:18:48,381 --> 00:18:50,450
{\an1}So that doesn't happen.

156
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:52,520
{\an1}You're still missing
the point!

157
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,790
The Five
Villages are actually
united right now!

158
00:18:55,822 --> 00:19:01,062
{\an1}Yeah But that's
only because they had
enemies in common.

159
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,967
The Akatsuki...
Madara,.. and
Kaguya...

160
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:10,273
{\an1}The Five Villages had
no choice but to
discard their grudges

161
00:19:10,306 --> 00:19:12,208
{\an1}and form an alliance to survive.

162
00:19:13,577 --> 00:19:16,980
{\an1}But every last one of
those mutual foes is
gone now.

163
00:19:17,014 --> 00:19:20,518
{\an1}So the villages will eventually
just begin bickering again.

164
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:23,822
You're saying that
you intend on becoming
their next enemy,

165
00:19:23,854 --> 00:19:25,423
is that it?

166
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:29,228
{\an5}But then what?
What's gonna happen
after you're dead?
What then, huh?!

167
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:34,568
{\an1}Finally, the dots
have connected into a
straight line.

168
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:39,906
{\an4}I started with the
Sharingan, but now I
have the Rinnegan's
powers, too.

169
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,612
{\an4}Including
reincarnation,
immortality, I have
many options.

170
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,851
{\an4}I'll also be able to
control things from
the shadows, instead
of through battle.

171
00:19:49,485 --> 00:19:51,620
You'd return to
that...  hell...

172
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,723
{\an1}for the rest of your
lifetime?!

173
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:57,127
I mean for
eternity, being hated
by everyone?

174
00:19:59,963 --> 00:20:04,301
{\an8}Yes. To me...
that's exactly what
a Hokage ought to be.

175
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,651
That's not even
close to good enough
to kill me.

176
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:22,355
{\an5}I told you! I'm
not trying to kill
you! Don't you get
that?!

177
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,824
{\an1}I just want you to-

178
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:25,426
I've had enough.

179
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:39,442
(Rumbling)

180
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:05,672
{\an7}At this moment I'm
the strongest in the
whole world.

181
00:21:05,705 --> 00:21:10,376
{\an7}And right here and
now, this will be the
first step that I take
into the shadows.

182
00:22:58,434 --> 00:23:02,472
{\an1}I can feel it! How'd
he suddenly gain so
much Nature Energy?

183
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:04,908
{\an1}Finally decided to
kill me, huh?

184
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:08,545
{\an1}We've taken a lot of
responsibilities upon
our shoulders...

185
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:13,018
But you see, I
actually do wanna
fight against you!

186
00:23:13,051 --> 00:23:15,152
And I wanna win
fair and square!

187
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:19,959
{\an1}Next time on Naruto
Shippuden: "Naruto and
Sasuke."

188
00:23:19,993 --> 00:23:23,295
Although... not
against the current
you!
