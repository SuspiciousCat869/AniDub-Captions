00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:15,516
{\an1}This is a story from
back when I was a bit
younger.

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:22,423
{\an4}I was a much feistier ostrich
then than I am now, and my
greatest rival by far was a
kid named Naruto Uzumaki.

4
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:24,727
{\an1}Naruto! Naruto!

5
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:28,830
{\an1}He was an obnoxious
brat who threatened
my very freedom!

6
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:34,471
{\an4}It was a time when it seemed
that life was just passing
him by... while he stood
there helpless.

7
00:00:34,504 --> 00:00:36,740
{\an1}It must have been one
of his lowest points.

8
00:00:36,772 --> 00:00:41,512
{\an1}Sasuke had left the village,
and Naruto was questioning
his own strength.

9
00:00:41,545 --> 00:00:45,249
{\an1}Yes. And Tsunade had
just been named Hokage.

10
00:00:45,283 --> 00:00:47,719
{\an1}It was right before
Naruto set out with
Jiraiya...

11
00:00:52,457 --> 00:00:57,329
{\an1}Listen quietly now. And
I'll tell you of my tale
with Naruto.

12
00:00:57,362 --> 00:01:02,168
{\an1}What?! You want me to
find someone's lost bird?!

13
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:06,873
{\an1}Ha, come on, that's a total
rookie mission! Thanks, but
no thanks!

14
00:01:06,906 --> 00:01:11,145
{\an1}There's an important reason
why it has to be you, Naruto.

15
00:01:11,178 --> 00:01:13,247
{\an1}Huh?

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,915
{\an1}Hmm...

17
00:01:14,948 --> 00:01:16,351
{\an1}Hey, this is-!

18
00:01:20,522 --> 00:01:23,892
{\an1}How many times is that
bird gonna run away?!

19
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:29,700
{\an4}The situation's even worse than
you might imagine. That ostrich
has trained himself to become a
<i>ninja</i> ostrich.

20
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:32,436
{\an1}What?!
Seriously?!
A ninja?!

21
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:37,174
{\an1}You heard right. This is
far more than a mission
to capture a missing pet!

22
00:01:37,207 --> 00:01:41,746
{\an1}You called for
me, Lady Hokage?

23
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:44,916
{\an1}I understand that you
have a job for me?

24
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:47,218
{\an1}You're to be
the team captain.

25
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:49,854
{\an1}I'm what?!
Team captain!?

26
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:51,623
{\an1}Me? Really?!

27
00:01:51,657 --> 00:01:56,663
{\an1}Yes, Kotetsu. Your team
will capture an escapee.
Your target's an ostrich.

28
00:01:56,696 --> 00:01:57,530
{\an1}Yes, ma'am!

29
00:01:57,564 --> 00:01:59,766
{\an1}Wait...
An ostrich?!

30
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,769
{\an1}An <i>escape</i> ostrich.

31
00:02:01,802 --> 00:02:03,970
{\an1}He's in the Hidden
Leaf training grounds.

32
00:02:04,003 --> 00:02:07,274
{\an1}The training grounds? Where
the Chunin Exam was held?

33
00:02:07,308 --> 00:02:09,845
{\an1}The place with all those
giant centipedes?!

34
00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:13,715
{\an4}No, not quite;
we used Training
Ground 44 for the
Chunin Exam.

35
00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:16,418
{\an1}But you are going
to Training Ground
Zero.

36
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:19,154
{\an1}There's actually a
Training Ground Zero?

37
00:02:19,187 --> 00:02:24,961
{\an7}There is. However, it's not
used for drills anymore, and
hasn't been for a very long
time.

38
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:32,903
{\an4}In fact, it's become an animal
preserve for fierce and exotic
beasts of prey from nations
worldwide.

39
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:35,005
{\an1}Entry is strictly
prohibited.

40
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:38,008
{\an1}People haven't been allowed
in since I was a child.

41
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:42,113
{\an1}So no one really knows
how the ecology has
changed since then.

42
00:02:42,147 --> 00:02:46,050
{\an1}It's also been proclaimed
a "No Hunting Area."

43
00:02:48,454 --> 00:02:51,490
{\an1}Well, this is it; we've
reached Training Ground
Zero.

44
00:02:51,524 --> 00:02:56,061
{\an1}Of all the places in the world,
why'd that annoying ostrich have
to escape to here?!

45
00:02:56,096 --> 00:02:59,232
{\an1}The way I figure...
it came here because--

46
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:02,302
{\an1}My arms are itching
for action, and so
are my legs!

47
00:03:02,336 --> 00:03:06,107
{\an1}Whoever the four
of us face, I <i>will</i>
defeat them all!

48
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,679
{\an4}By the way, I
had a question...
have you three ever
teamed up before?

49
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:13,582
{\an1}Hmm. Now that you
mention it...

50
00:03:13,615 --> 00:03:16,151
{\an1}May we enter?

51
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:18,153
{\an1}No... because I don't--

52
00:03:18,187 --> 00:03:21,424
{\an1}Yeah, all right, fine!
Let's just go.

53
00:03:23,761 --> 00:03:26,597
{\an7}<i>Curse you, Lady Hokage...</i>

54
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,835
{\an7}<i>She just assigned this mission</i>
<i>to any genin who happened to be</i>
<i>around.</i>

55
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:32,436
{\an1}What?!

56
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,338
{\an1}Kotetsu's
team captain?!

57
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:36,274
{\an1}Huh? What is
the matter?

58
00:03:36,308 --> 00:03:38,310
{\an1}He's on a mission
without me?

59
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:43,081
{\an1}It's not as though I felt your
abilities were lacking compared
to his or something.

60
00:03:43,114 --> 00:03:46,085
{\an1}Kotetsu was just available,
that's all there is to it.

61
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:48,988
{\an1}All right, Izumo?
There's no reason
to get upset.

62
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:52,459
{\an1}Why!? Why didn't
I get to go along
with Kotetsu?!

63
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:56,463
{\an1}Stop your whining,
you annoying crybaby!

64
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:43,350
{\an1}"Animal District"

65
00:05:43,383 --> 00:05:49,122
{\an4}Okay... We'll proceed in a
single-file line formation.
Naruto, you take you take
the lead.

66
00:05:49,155 --> 00:05:49,924
{\an1}Right!

67
00:05:49,957 --> 00:05:51,425
{\an1}I'll go second.

68
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:54,630
{\an1}And if anything
happens to Naruto,
then I'll back him up.

69
00:05:54,663 --> 00:06:00,803
{\an4}Next will be Shino. Keep a
watch on your left and right
sides. And Lee? You bring up
the rear.

70
00:06:00,837 --> 00:06:02,071
{\an1}Understood, sir.

71
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:04,440
{\an1}I believe I should
be the rear guard.

72
00:06:04,474 --> 00:06:05,975
{\an1}Why?

73
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:10,313
{\an1}Because someone with eyes
in the back of his head is
perfect as the rear guard.

74
00:06:10,346 --> 00:06:14,351
{\an1}I must admit I do not
have eyes in the back
of my head. But, do you?

75
00:06:14,385 --> 00:06:21,626
{\an4}Not literally, of course. But
my vision is similar to how
an insect with compound eyes
would see the world.

76
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,396
{\an1}For crying out loud,
just get to the point,
Shino!

77
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:29,635
{\an1}Listen, we all understand.
You're saying that your insects
will watch our backs, right?

78
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:35,441
{\an4}Let's not get ahead of
ourselves. Because, unless the
the captain agrees to my idea,
we can't change positions.

79
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:38,779
{\an1}Fine, take the rear, Shino.
You'll also be my lieutenant.

80
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:45,053
{\an4}No way! If anyone's gonna be
lieutenant, then it should be
me! I mean, I'm the only one
who's met the ostrich before!

81
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:49,724
{\an1}That's why I put you
in the lead position.
Now, let's start walking.

82
00:06:49,757 --> 00:06:51,292
{\an1}[groan]

83
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:55,564
{\an1}Just one more thing.
Where's the bird supposed
to be hiding this time?

84
00:06:55,597 --> 00:06:58,534
{\an1}I thought...
Lady Hokage said
you'd know.

85
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,536
{\an1}That's why you're
leading the way.

86
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:05,341
{\an4}No, I only know what
the ostrich looks like.
But I have no idea where
he is right now!

assign a sensory-type ninja
to this mission like I asked?!

{\an1}Like a Hyuga or an Inuzuka...

{\an1}They're all busy on
other missions right
now.

{\an1}Lady Hokage...

92
00:07:22,794 --> 00:07:25,531
{\an1}So...what do
we do now?

93
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:27,100
{\an1}I'll find it.

Aburame clan, huh?
Excellent.

{\an1}Haven't you found
that bird yet, Shino?!

97
00:07:46,222 --> 00:07:48,758
{\an1}There's a lot of ground
to cover. Be patient.

98

that he has a father.

{\an1}Izumo, thanks so

You saved me!

{\an1}If you hadn't come,
I would've been done
for!

00:19:17,362 --> 00:19:23,168
{\an1}There is one little problem.
I came before I finished some
business for Lady Hokage.

334
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:26,773
{\an1}Then...
When we get back, it's
my turn to help you!

{\an1}Hey, there!

{\an1}Damn it!

{\an1}Don't try running
away again; I'll
just catch you!

{\an1}I'm not sure
that you'll
understand this.

at Mount Jofuku on the border of

{\an4}It's said to glow in seven

and difficult to obtain.

me finish my sentence!

{\an1}That's Lord
Jiraiya's code?

363
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:34,117
{\an4}Based on what I heard,
Shikamaru and the Cipher
Corps are trying to figure
out what it means right now.

Why didn't Lady Tsunade
come to us for help with
this assignment?

{\an4}Yeah, I know! With all of
the boring duties we have
like gate-keeping and
archiving data...

{\an1}We can't keep
our fans happy.

{\an4}I remember back when
we were proctors for
Shikamaru and the
others.

368
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:52,771
{\an1}Now, he's the
same rank as us.

369
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,406
{\an1}Actually, he's
ranked higher
than we are!

[sigh]

371
00:22:58,144 --> 00:22:59,945
{\an1}Well, there's just
one thing to do!

372
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:02,982
{\an1}Right, we'll have to
decipher this code
before they do.

373
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:07,254
{\an1}And that'll leave
them speechless!

374
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,825
{\an1}Izumo, Kotetsu,
I have a job
for you to...do..

{\an1}I'll leave you
two alone.

00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:21,536
{\an4}No, wait,
Lady Tsunade!
Lady Tsunade, you've
got it all wrong!

378
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:23,138
{\an1}It's not what
you think at all!
Please!

379
00:23:23,172 --> 00:23:25,506
{\an4}Please, come back,
Lady Tsunade!
Just wait a second
and let us explain!
