1
00:00:15,656 --> 00:00:16,824
Here they come.

2
00:00:18,993 --> 00:00:20,496
{\an1}<i>[Kabuto]</i>
<i>Mu's stopped moving.</i>

3
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,300
{\an1}The Second Tsuchikage
has been detected.

4
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:28,873
{\an1}They called him the
"Null Man" because he had
neither form nor chakra.

5
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:33,846
{\an1}The battlefield should be
coming together nicely.
Now begins the real fun.

6
00:00:35,848 --> 00:00:40,220
{\an1}And with this next group
of shinobi, I anticipate
bigger and better results

7
00:00:40,254 --> 00:00:42,824
{\an1}by keeping all their thoughts
and emotions intact.

8
00:00:47,363 --> 00:00:50,567
{\an1}I think I'll let him do
his own thing after the
Summoning Jutsu.

9
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:38,905
{\an1}"The Brilliant Military
Advisor of the Hidden Leaf"

10
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:57,561
{\an1}The Second Tsuchikage.

11
00:02:58,362 --> 00:02:59,664
{\an1}<i>The Third Raikage.</i>

12
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:02,001
{\an1}<i>The Second Mizukage.</i>

13
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:04,336
<i>The Fourth Kazekage.</i>

14
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:08,675
{\an1}<i>It's too bad I wasn't</i>
<i>able to get a Hokage.</i>

15
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,980
{\an1}Still, to have four of
the strongest Kage ever.

16
00:03:12,715 --> 00:03:13,816
[chuckle]

17
00:03:15,284 --> 00:03:17,587
{\an1}I'm just going to let the
Kage and their progeny
kill each other off.

18
00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:20,524
Mmmhh?

19
00:03:21,692 --> 00:03:23,494
{\an1}Where am I?
What's going on?

20
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:27,900
My, my, my.

21
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:30,703
A friendly reunion
of past adversaries.

22
00:03:31,772 --> 00:03:34,408
Except, hold on,
I don't know you.

23
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:39,815
{\an1}This is a foul jutsu
of the Second Hokage.

24
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:42,619
{\an1}Recalling the dead
from the underworld
and enslaving them.

25
00:03:43,386 --> 00:03:45,655
{\an1}I was forced to
summon you all here.

26
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:48,559
Recalling the dead?!
And what do you
mean by that?

27
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:51,864
{\an1}Have you forgotten?!
I killed you myself.

28
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:55,769
{\an1}You've been dead a
long, long time,
Second Mizukage.

29
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,175
Oh...!
Yes, of course.

30
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:03,212
Hey, wait!
I remember
it all now!

31
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:04,847
You died on
that day, too!

32
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:06,916
In fact, I'm the one
that killed you!

33
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:10,721
{\an1}Is that so?
Well, never
mind that now.

34
00:04:11,622 --> 00:04:14,526
{\an1}Listen to me.
Wait, where was I?

35
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,364
{\an1}Where's the Second Hokage,
the one who resurrected us?

36
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:23,370
{\an1}[Mu]
I do detect someone
several kilometers ahead.

37
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,913
{\an1}<i>A chakra that feels the same</i>
<i>as this newcomer. And an army.</i>

38
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,715
{\an1}Wait, I know
who you are.

39
00:04:33,683 --> 00:04:36,221
{\an1}I am the Fourth Kazekage
of the Sand.

40
00:04:36,587 --> 00:04:40,026
{\an1}My predecessors have
told me about the
exploits of you three.

41
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,462
That means the Sand
has continued through
to the Fourth--

42
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:46,266
no, it has to be the
Fifth generation by now.

43
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:50,505
It feels incredibly
strange being here in
the future like this.

44
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:55,611
{\an1}Listen, this isn't really the
future. We're just beings
brought back from the past.

45
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,615
{\an1}And don't interrupt me
anymore, or I'll kill you!

46
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:02,988
{\an5}I was already killed,
you fool! And I was
the one who killed
you, remember?!

47
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:08,194
{\an4}I'm just trying to tell
you the story of the
Second Hokage, the one
who resurrected us!

48
00:05:08,695 --> 00:05:09,296
Bah!

49
00:05:11,497 --> 00:05:15,704
Even by my time, the
Second Hokage was
already long deceased.

50
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:19,909
{\an1}But there was another
shinobi who'd also mastered
the Reanimation Jutsu...

51
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:23,180
A shinobi named
Orochimaru.

52
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:31,891
<i>[Gaara]</i>
<i>There are four.</i>
<i>and among them,</i>

53
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,061
is my father.

54
00:05:42,437 --> 00:05:43,172
That's it.

55
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:43,806
{\an1}Mm.

56
00:05:48,512 --> 00:05:50,047
{\an1}It's a message
from HQ.

57
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:53,818
{\an1}Our Commando Unit fought
the enemy's Commando Unit.

58
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:55,888
{\an1}Seems we were right
about the enemy.

59
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,094
{\an1}<i>They're using the Reanimation</i>
<i>Jutsu to raise the dead and send</i>
<i>them onto the battlefield.</i>

60
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:05,401
{\an4}Who knows what kind of
shinobi we're going to
run into out there.
So everyone...

61
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:07,404
Make sure you're
prepared for anything.

62
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:10,240
Huh!?

63
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:12,442
{\an1}<i>He's giving the signal.</i>

64
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:15,513
The enemy is close.

65
00:06:17,049 --> 00:06:19,385
{\an1}But there hasn't been any
word from Headquarters that
they detected the enemy.

66
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:20,887
{\an1}What's going
on here?

67
00:06:22,322 --> 00:06:24,892
{\an1}Maybe there are some
enemies that even the
guys at HQ can't detect.

68
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:29,898
{\an1}I mean, I'm sure the enemy
will only revive really
strong shinobi, you know?

69
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,269
So we seriously
have to fight
dead people?

70
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:36,940
But what do we do?!
I'm getting really
scared here.

71
00:06:37,207 --> 00:06:38,608
{\an1}Come on, Choji.

72
00:06:38,642 --> 00:06:41,546
{\an1}It's too late to worry
about all of that now
that you're here.

73
00:06:43,048 --> 00:06:44,083
Mm-hmm.

74
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:53,395
{\an1}We have a message from Captain
Gaara's Fourth Company.
They've spotted four enemies.

75
00:06:54,262 --> 00:07:00,069
{\an1}They're the Second Mizukage,
the Second Tsuchikage,
the Fourth Kazekage, and...

76
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:03,375
{\an1}Yes?
Who's the fourth one?!

77
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:04,575
[hesitant grunt]

78
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:08,047
{\an1}They say that it's the
Third Lord Raikage, sir.

79
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,616
{\an1}What?! My father, too?!

80
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:13,687
Rrrgh!
Those Akatsuki!

81
00:07:15,323 --> 00:07:18,293
But the numbers don't
match up with our own
sensory readings.

82
00:07:18,926 --> 00:07:20,561
You're sure this
intel's accurate?

83
00:07:21,431 --> 00:07:22,798
{\an1}<i>[Tsuchikage]</i>
<i>Princess Tsunade.</i>

84
00:07:24,134 --> 00:07:26,703
The Second Tsuchikage
is among the enemy.

85
00:07:26,736 --> 00:07:27,570
Ah!

86
00:07:29,106 --> 00:07:33,178
{\an5}Knowing that, it's
no surprise at all
that we were able to
sense three of them,

87
00:07:33,212 --> 00:07:35,615
but weren't able
to detect the
fourth enemy.

88
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:42,290
{\an1}It becomes all too
clear once you factor
in Lord Mu's presence.

89
00:07:42,323 --> 00:07:43,558
{\an1}It's all his doing!

90
00:07:47,797 --> 00:07:53,538
{\an7}<i>There's someone that even HQ's</i>
<i>Sensory Radar Jutsu couldn't</i>
<i>detect? He's skilled.</i>

91
00:07:54,105 --> 00:07:57,575
{\an1}Captain Ao! There are far
too many of those white
monsters out there.

92
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,947
{\an1}<i>I can't detect anyone with</i>
<i>special characteristics.</i>

93
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,021
{\an1}Darui's First Company
is about to come under
attack by thousands!

94
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:11,094
{\an1}I'm going to need help
distinguishing the reanimated
ninja from the white ones.

95
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:15,499
{\an1}All right! You take charge
of the broad-range scan!

96
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:25,878
[gasp]
This is bad!

97
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:29,683
{\an1}There are way too many
reanimated shinobi attacking
Darui's First Company!

98
00:08:30,351 --> 00:08:34,022
{\an1}And it appears that each one
of them is more powerful than
the one that came before!

99
00:08:56,184 --> 00:08:59,654
{\an1}They're coming. Give the
signal to prepare for battle.

100
00:09:00,222 --> 00:09:00,590
{\an1}Right.

101
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,790
Yes, sir!

102
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:04,361
There are just
so many of them.

103
00:09:04,995 --> 00:09:06,964
{\an1}And their number is
not the only concern.

104
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:12,438
{\an1}Just as Headquarters reported,
I can distinguish which are the
adept ones with my Byakugan.

105
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:19,880
{\an1}Lord Hiashi!
Look towards
ten o'clock!

106
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,818
Ah! That's!

107
00:09:31,795 --> 00:09:32,964
[gasp]

108
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:44,145
There's no way!
Can't be!

109
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:47,382
What is it?
What's the matter?
What do you see?

110
00:09:48,618 --> 00:09:50,186
Those two down
there are...

111
00:09:50,653 --> 00:09:52,989
{\an1}<i>Lords Kinkaku and Ginkaku!</i>

112
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,368
{\an1}Who are those two shinobi?!
They possess the
Nine Tails' chakra!

113
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:03,936
{\an1}And they have a lot of it!

114
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,907
Ah, no, there's
no mistaking it.

115
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,277
{\an1}It's The Gold and Silver
Brothers of the Cloud!

116
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:11,614
What's that?!

117
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,115
[gasp]

118
00:10:13,582 --> 00:10:15,418
{\an7}<i>Even Dan has been revived?!</i>

119
00:10:17,254 --> 00:10:18,855
{\an1}[growl]

120
00:10:20,324 --> 00:10:22,461
Fourth Company's
facing my old man.

121
00:10:22,827 --> 00:10:25,297
{\an1}First Company's fighting
Kinkaku and Ginkaku.

122
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:29,603
{\an1}Now that it's come to this,
I must go join the battle!

123
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:30,970
{\an1}Please reconsider.

124
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:32,139
Hmm?

125
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,646
{\an1}You're the Supreme Commander
of the Allied Shinobi Forces,
Lord Raikage.

126
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:43,053
{\an4}The Supreme Commander must
remain safe and continue
to give orders until the
final stages of the war.

127
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:46,457
{\an1}That is your responsibility
to your charges.

128
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:48,460
Hrrmh.

129
00:10:49,995 --> 00:10:53,032
{\an1}But, still. Darui's company
can't withstand this many
powerful shinobi!

130
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:57,305
{\an1}The tide of battle is
fluid, like a living thing.

131
00:10:57,338 --> 00:10:59,106
It can change
at any second.

132
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,144
{\an1}And to discern those changes
is why you brought me here!

133
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,614
{\an1}Look at the map.

134
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:08,319
{\an1}To get started, let's verify
the status of every company.

135
00:11:10,522 --> 00:11:14,159
{\an4}<i>At the forefront,</i>
<i>behind enemy lines,</i>
<i>is Kankuro's</i>
<i>Commando Unit.</i>

136
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:22,303
{\an1}<i>They've skirmished</i>
<i>with a Commando Unit</i>
<i>of reanimated shinobi.</i>

137
00:11:23,504 --> 00:11:25,006
{\an1}<i>They vanquished the enemy.</i>

138
00:11:25,674 --> 00:11:28,611
{\an1}<i>And presently are moving</i>
<i>towards the Akatsuki hideout.</i>

139
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:33,484
Now let's switch our
focus and take a look at
the combat battalions.

140
00:11:34,017 --> 00:11:36,822
{\an1}<i>Kakashi's Third Company</i>
<i>is leading the charge.</i>

141
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:41,194
{\an1}<i>They are in the midst of</i>
<i>battle, but word is that</i>
<i>they've taken the advantage.</i>

142
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:44,964
Hmm.

143
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:48,536
{\an1}Right now, the other big
battle that's about to begin,

144
00:11:48,837 --> 00:11:51,574
{\an1}<i>...is here, with</i>
<i>Kitsuchi's Second Company.</i>

145
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:02,688
{\an4}<i>And Mifune's Fifth Company is</i>
<i>standing by to assist in any</i>
<i>battle where we decide</i>
<i>reinforcements will be needed.</i>

146
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,626
{\an1}All right, then.
let's start here.

147
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:13,000
{\an1}<i>The enemy's unit is</i>
<i>approaching from the sea.</i>

148
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:16,438
{\an1}<i>Darui's First Company</i>
<i>will engage them.</i>

149
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,043
{\an1}<i>We'll call this Battlefield A.</i>

150
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:24,114
<i>And in the other main</i>
<i>battlefield,</i>

151
00:12:24,148 --> 00:12:26,618
{\an1}<i>facing the previous Kage</i>
<i>who've suddenly appeared,</i>

152
00:12:28,521 --> 00:12:30,189
{\an1}<i>...is Gaara's Fourth Company. </i>

153
00:12:32,526 --> 00:12:34,161
{\an1}<i>We'll call that Battlefield B.</i>

154
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,801
Hmm.

155
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:43,606
{\an4}When you look at it like
this, it appears that
we're evenly matched in
strength with our enemy.

156
00:12:44,674 --> 00:12:46,610
It's inadvisable
to assume that.

157
00:12:47,177 --> 00:12:48,011
Hmm?

158
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:53,886
{\an1}The ironclad rule of battle
strategy is to take the
advantage by mobilizing troops!

159
00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:57,490
{\an1}<i>If the enemy advances</i>
<i>from two directions,</i>

160
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:03,965
{\an1}<i>Instead of engaging both sides,</i>
<i>you counter by attacking one</i>
<i>side with your full force. </i>

161
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:06,000
Mmm.

162
00:13:07,804 --> 00:13:11,341
{\an1}<i>We're dealing with two</i>
<i>battlefields here: A and B.</i>

163
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:16,347
{\an1}<i>In our case, we'll start</i>
<i>with battlefield A.</i>

164
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:19,953
{\an1}<i>We'll concentrate our forces</i>
<i>around Darui's First Company.</i>

165
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:26,895
{\an1}<i>Mifune's Fifth Company needs</i>
<i>to join up with First Company</i>
<i>to reinforce their ranks,</i>

166
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:29,664
{\an1}<i>while still maintaining</i>
<i>their belt formation.</i>

167
00:13:31,032 --> 00:13:34,571
{\an1}<i>Kitsuchi's Second Company</i>
<i>needs to fan out lengthwise.</i>

168
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,007
{\an1}<i>They must surround the</i>
<i>enemy and box them in.</i>

169
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:41,714
{\an1}<i>The Second Company</i>
<i>may be stretched a little thin.</i>

170
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:46,285
But the Fifth Company's
belt formation will
serve to buttress them.

171
00:13:48,054 --> 00:13:51,425
<i>Meanwhile, Gaara's</i>
<i>Fourth Company needs</i>
<i>to make a slow retreat</i>

172
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:55,430
{\an1}<i>to the far side of</i>
<i>the battlefield in a</i>
<i>reverse L-Formation.</i>

173
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:57,600
{\an1}<i>This will lure the</i>
<i>enemy forward.</i>

174
00:14:00,036 --> 00:14:04,009
{\an4}<i>From there, half of</i>
<i>Gaara's force will head to</i>
<i>join up with Darui's First</i>
<i>Company as reinforcements.</i>

175
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:14,354
{\an1}<i>And after they wipe out the</i>
<i>enemy at Battlefield A,</i>

176
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:21,330
{\an1}<i>Darui's First Company and</i>
<i>Gaara's squads will turn</i>
<i>back towards Battlefield B.</i>

177
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,303
{\an1}<i>We'll have them decisively hit</i>
<i>the enemy at Battlefield B,</i>

178
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:29,307
{\an1}<i>which Gaara's Fourth Company</i>
<i>will draw in, from the rear.</i>

179
00:14:33,846 --> 00:14:35,181
Hmmm.

180
00:14:36,082 --> 00:14:38,117
{\an1}Why start with Battlefield A?

181
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,656
{\an1}<i>[Raikage]</i>
<i>If you split Gaara's</i>
<i>Fourth Company in half,</i>

182
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:46,862
{\an1}<i>the enemy they're facing may</i>
<i>use that opportunity to launch</i>
<i>an all-out assault, right?</i>

183
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:50,801
{\an1}You must not
underestimate those four.

184
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:53,438
{\an1}Don't forget, they're
former Kage, all of them!

185
00:14:54,305 --> 00:14:55,206
Mmm.

186
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:57,476
{\an1}Well, with Battlefield A,

187
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:02,049
{\an1}<i>The Second and Fifth Companies</i>
<i>are nearby, and they can</i>
<i>be mobilized quickly.</i>

188
00:15:02,582 --> 00:15:06,253
{\an1}<i>Also, Kitsuchi's Second Company</i>
<i>is already familiar</i>
<i>with the enemy.</i>

189
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:09,759
{\an1}<i>They can attack the white</i>
<i>ninja from behind with a</i>
<i>high rate of success.</i>

190
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:14,531
{\an1}And then,
as for Battlefield B,

191
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:18,268
{\an1}It's doubtful the former
Kage will launch an attack.

192
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:21,040
Hmmm?

193
00:15:22,108 --> 00:15:23,977
{\an1}If our troops suddenly
drop to half their number,

194
00:15:24,011 --> 00:15:26,278
the enemy is going
to think we're up
to something.

195
00:15:26,313 --> 00:15:28,315
They'll be wary of
a careless move.

196
00:15:29,517 --> 00:15:30,218
Hmm.

197
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,526
{\an4}The war-savvy former Kage
won't be so foolish as to risk
an attack in an uncertain
situation like that.

198
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,328
Yes, I see it now.

199
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:39,596
Mmm.

200
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:45,470
{\an4}And even if the enemy
were to attack, Gaara's
Fourth Company is still a
long-range battle unit.

201
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,107
{\an1}They specialize in
distance fighting,

202
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:51,344
{\an1}so it'll take the enemy
longer to engage them
in close-range combat.

203
00:15:51,745 --> 00:15:54,683
{\an1}<i>In other words, it's a</i>
<i>company that can buy us time.</i>

204
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,122
{\an1}Well, what do you say,
Supreme Commander?

205
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:05,930
{\an1}It's no wonder the Hidden Leaf
has been difficult to defeat.

206
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:09,702
{\an1}You're blessed with good
shinobi, Lady Tsunade.

207
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,806
{\an1}Hold off on the compliments
until we win the war.

208
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:13,606
So.

209
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:15,575
What do we do?

210
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:20,247
Mmm. All right!
Let's try it!

211
00:16:22,317 --> 00:16:23,920
{\an1}Good. Inoichi, are
you listening?

212
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:26,889
{\an1}Yes I've already relayed it.
Also!

213
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:30,427
{\an1}<i>We've contacted Mifune</i>
<i>about the Commando Unit,</i>
<i>and they're on their way.</i>

214
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:36,168
{\an1}<i>I've had Shizune divide</i>
<i>the injured up evenly</i>
<i>to be treated, as well.</i>

215
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:43,544
There's a unit of
reanimated ninja.

216
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,514
I guess the war's
really starting.

217
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:51,721
{\an1}Shikaku is thinking
up strategies back
at Headquarters.

218
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,023
Huh?

219
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,428
{\an1}It's simply incredible.
That guy is an amazingly
clear thinker.

220
00:16:58,063 --> 00:17:02,902
{\an4}He's able to come up with
all these brilliant tactics
that I could never even
imagine in a million years!

221
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,304
Oh.

222
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:08,676
{\an1}And Inoichi will get those
plans to us without fail, so
don't be so worried, okay?

223
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:13,281
{\an1}I believe in them,
and I'm going to make
my stand right here.

224
00:17:15,185 --> 00:17:18,021
{\an1}Tenten. Have faith
in our comrades.

225
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,302
Haaaa!

226
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:55,635
{\an1}Yeah, you're right. We have to
stay strong and hold back the
enemy for our comrades' sake.

227
00:17:56,103 --> 00:17:57,972
{\an1}Thanks, Choza! Let's do this!

228
00:17:59,574 --> 00:18:00,374
Mm!

229
00:18:01,376 --> 00:18:03,478
{\an1}That's it! All companies
have been notified!

230
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:16,929
{\an1}Hmh. Very good. It's
time for Ino-Shika-Cho
to make an appearance.

231
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:23,370
{\an1}Shikaku of the Leaf,
If I may interject here.

232
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:24,572
Of course, sir.

233
00:18:26,342 --> 00:18:31,147
{\an4}For your strategy to be
foolproof, you're going
to need to alter your
plan just slightly.

234
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:33,284
I will? How so?

235
00:18:34,552 --> 00:18:37,623
The Second Tsuchikage
is far from an
ordinary shinobi.

236
00:18:38,123 --> 00:18:40,692
{\an1}In fact, only the Old
Fence-Sitter can face him.

237
00:18:41,628 --> 00:18:44,331
{\an1}His name has come up quite
often in our discussions.

238
00:18:44,365 --> 00:18:46,800
{\an1}So tell me, how is
he exceptional?

239
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:52,842
{\an4}As soon as I heard that his
chakra can't be detected,
I knew he'd be a problem,
but what else?

240
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:58,082
{\an1}That he possesses the Kekkei
Touta, a trait that's more
powerful than the Kekkei Genkai.

241
00:18:58,515 --> 00:18:59,583
{\an1}The Kekkei Touta?!

242
00:19:01,085 --> 00:19:04,657
{\an1}I had thought that you
were the only wielder,
Third Tsuchikage! But...

243
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:07,193
{\an1}The Second Tsuchikage, too?

244
00:19:08,228 --> 00:19:13,802
{\an1}Simultaneous activation
of three chakra natures;
wind, earth, and fire, too.

245
00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:17,340
{\an1}Lord Second was my mentor,
the one who taught me
Particle Style.

246
00:19:17,974 --> 00:19:18,775
[gulp]

247
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:23,447
{\an1}I cannot believe that I have to
battle my master at my age.

248
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:26,184
{\an1}It does not pay to
live a long life.

249
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,121
So will you
go, then?

250
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:32,926
{\an1}Hmmh. What choice
do I have?

251
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:35,729
{\an1}Shikaku Nara.

252
00:19:35,997 --> 00:19:36,798
Yes, sir?

253
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:41,637
{\an1}<i>I'm not going solely</i>
<i>because Lord Mu of the</i>
<i>Particle Style is there.</i>

254
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:43,106
Huh?

255
00:19:44,107 --> 00:19:46,310
{\an1}I admit that your tactical
plan is brilliant.

256
00:19:46,344 --> 00:19:50,816
{\an1}And you're correct: the
reanimated Kage who stand
before the Fourth Company

257
00:19:50,849 --> 00:19:54,921
{\an1}know war well and will
not make any unnecessary
or rash maneuvers.

258
00:19:55,555 --> 00:19:58,959
{\an1}You're probably right in
your assessment of how
the battle will unfold.

259
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:05,201
{\an1}But it could be... that the
opposite is possible.

260
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,302
[gasp]

261
00:20:07,437 --> 00:20:10,140
{\an1}Gaara is the one who
united the Allied Forces.

262
00:20:10,941 --> 00:20:14,712
{\an1}And it was his youthful
determination that was
the primary catalyst.

263
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:18,617
{\an1}So you're suggesting that that
could have the opposite effect
out there on the battlefield.

264
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,391
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate
your insight.

265
00:20:23,424 --> 00:20:24,291
{\an1}Mmm.

266
00:20:25,494 --> 00:20:28,697
{\an1}Well then, I suppose
it's time for me to
leap into the war

267
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,035
{\an1}and show all of these
young brats what fighting
is really about.

268
00:20:32,935 --> 00:20:36,206
{\an1}Especially that brazen
young stripling. Hah.

269
00:20:42,348 --> 00:20:44,817
{\an1}This jutsu that
controls our bodies,

270
00:20:45,352 --> 00:20:50,258
{\an1}The user doesn't seem to be
the Second Hokage, but this
is his Reanimation Jutsu.

271
00:20:50,992 --> 00:20:53,362
There are times when
your body won't do
what you want.

272
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:55,697
Certain actions seem
to be restricted.

273
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,370
{\an1}You're right,
it does appear
to be that way.

274
00:20:59,403 --> 00:21:03,508
{\an4}I had thought about
killing you earlier,
but my body wouldn't
allow me to do it.

275
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:07,547
{\an5}It's a shame.
I would have
enjoyed battling
with all of you.
