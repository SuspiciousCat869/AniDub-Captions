1
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,521
-What's up with that?

2
00:00:09,521 --> 00:00:10,489
That drawing?

3
00:00:20,745 --> 00:00:22,247
That's freaky.

4
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:24,452
-The strange thing
about Sai's picture book

5
00:00:24,486 --> 00:00:25,788
are these pages in the center.

6
00:00:26,023 --> 00:00:27,793
They're the only
ones unfinished.

7
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:31,501
NARUTO: It's kind of
creepy, if you ask me.

8
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,042
-Naruto.

9
00:00:51,042 --> 00:00:52,646
-Huh?

10
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:55,185
-We're gonna do this.

11
00:00:55,218 --> 00:00:56,554
Together, we'll
bring Sasuke back.

12
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:04,070
-You bet we will.

13
00:01:18,769 --> 00:01:19,469
-You're late.

14
00:01:23,178 --> 00:01:25,449
Am I mistaken, or
weren't you supposed

15
00:01:25,482 --> 00:01:29,223
to be here to help me hone
a new jutsu this afternoon,

16
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:31,362
Orochimaru?

17
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:34,234
-There's that
insolent tone again.

18
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:36,606
-Try not to be too upset.

19
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,677
I thought we'd do
something different today,

20
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:43,220
so I brought along a
little present for you.

21
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,327
He's a Leaf shinobi,
just like you.

22
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,366
I thought you two might like
to get together and reminisce.

23
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,137
Swap stories of home.

24
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:04,841
-Hmph.

25
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:10,416
SAI (VOICEOVER): Sasuke Uchiha.

26
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:16,596
[theme music]

27
00:04:15,617 --> 00:04:18,790
-So, I presume
you're Sasuke Uchiha?

28
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:20,026
My name is Sai--

29
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:20,894
SASUKE: Get lost.

30
00:04:28,711 --> 00:04:31,652
-It seems I'm the sort
of person that people

31
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:33,989
don't like right away,
even if I wear a smile.

32
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:39,501
-Naruto took an instant
disliking towards me, as well.

33
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:51,126
However, I have a funny feeling
that you and I will get along

34
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,529
better than I did with him.

35
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:20,337
-Sasuke!

36
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:34,323
-I'm sweating.

37
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:53,965
SAI (VOICEOVER): I
have no emotions.

38
00:05:53,998 --> 00:05:57,539
I can feel nothing, and yet
just by meeting his eyes,

39
00:05:57,572 --> 00:06:01,280
I somehow fear Sasuke,
from the bottom

40
00:06:01,313 --> 00:06:05,122
of a heart I didn't think I had.

41
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:10,332
-It's probably not a good idea
to provoke Sasuke too much.

42
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:12,070
He's even more
difficult than I am.

43
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:18,851
-I don't care about this guy.

44
00:06:18,884 --> 00:06:20,956
Come on, Orochimaru.

45
00:06:20,956 --> 00:06:22,358
Let's go.

46
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:24,964
-I've heard a lot about you.

47
00:06:24,997 --> 00:06:27,903
From Naruto.

48
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:31,111
It seems he's been searching
for you all this time.

49
00:06:31,144 --> 00:06:32,246
For three years, now.

50
00:06:36,857 --> 00:06:38,994
-I remember someone like that.

51
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,940
Orochimaru, let's go.

52
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:48,180
-You mean a great
deal to Naruto.

53
00:06:48,214 --> 00:06:51,087
He thinks of you as a brother.

54
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,358
At least, that's
what Sakura told me.

55
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:04,882
-As far as brothers
go, I have only one.

56
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,486
The one that I must kill.

57
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:17,042
-I'll be leaving
you now, as well.

58
00:07:17,075 --> 00:07:18,912
Here, take this, Kabuto.

59
00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:22,420
I want a bingo book made
out of its contents.

60
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,590
-Right.

61
00:07:23,623 --> 00:07:25,660
-I'll leave
everything up to you.

62
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,653
-What's this?

63
00:07:37,686 --> 00:07:40,325
The ANBU Black Ops
registry of members

64
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:42,196
directly assigned to the Hokage.

65
00:07:49,444 --> 00:07:50,246
It seems authentic.

66
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:55,357
-Is this the place?

67
00:07:59,198 --> 00:08:02,572
-The entrance is straight ahead,
under that rock formation.

68
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:04,343
-Could it be, after
all this time,

69
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:05,612
that we've really found him?

70
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,091
Sasuke's there.

71
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:14,230
-Yeah, it's a
definite possibility.

72
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,235
-At the very least, we
should be able to find

73
00:08:16,235 --> 00:08:17,271
a clue to his whereabouts.

74
00:08:20,444 --> 00:08:21,179
-Right.

75
00:08:21,212 --> 00:08:23,351
Let's get on with it.

76
00:08:23,384 --> 00:08:24,186
-Hold it.

77
00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:24,701
Not so fast.

78
00:08:45,313 --> 00:08:47,250
First, you need to
swallow this, Naruto.

79
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:04,787
You don't have to worry.

80
00:09:04,821 --> 00:09:06,625
It's perfectly
safe, I assure you.

81
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:11,368
Here, Sakura.

82
00:09:11,368 --> 00:09:13,338
You, too.

83
00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:15,510
Now even if we
should get separated,

84
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,416
I'll know where the both
of you, and can find you.

85
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:19,251
-Huh?

86
00:09:19,285 --> 00:09:20,821
-Seriously?

87
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:24,162
-Because of this?

88
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,832
What is it?

89
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,137
-Those days are a
kind of transmitter,

90
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:30,107
specifically for tracking
a person's movements.

91
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:38,693
It's a ninja tool that is only
able to work off my chakra.

92
00:09:38,726 --> 00:09:43,403
I planted one of these in Sai's
clothing, and in his food.

93
00:09:43,403 --> 00:09:45,341
-In his clothing
and in his food?

94
00:09:50,351 --> 00:09:53,157
-It's a seed?

95
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:54,426
Of course.

96
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:56,163
That's why you were able to
track him all the way here.

97
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,902
-But Captain Yamato, when did
you plant these things on him?

98
00:09:58,936 --> 00:10:00,606
-Back at the hot springs.

99
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,612
Do you remember how I was the
first to get out of the water?

100
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,753
-Uh, yeah, I think so.

101
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:08,890
-Well, I think I've
soaked enough for one day.

102
00:10:14,336 --> 00:10:15,538
-Yeah, I remember now.

103
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:17,810
You got out and went inside.

104
00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:21,718
-You see, I'm afraid I had an
ulterior motive for treating

105
00:10:21,718 --> 00:10:25,326
you guys for that stay at the
hot springs, and that feast.

106
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:26,962
At my expense.

107
00:10:27,196 --> 00:10:29,568
-So all that wasn't just
to boost morale and team

108
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:30,091
spirit, huh?

109
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,671
-Lady Tsunade had
warned me about Sai.

110
00:10:35,704 --> 00:10:39,479
She asked me to
keep an eye on him.

111
00:10:39,512 --> 00:10:40,982
-One more thing.

112
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,721
Team Kakashi will be getting
a new face in its ranks.

113
00:10:43,721 --> 00:10:47,462
From the Foundation, the
Black Ops Training Division.

114
00:10:47,462 --> 00:10:48,732
However--

115
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:49,934
-Yes, milady?

116
00:10:49,968 --> 00:10:52,540
-Keep a very close eye on him.

117
00:10:52,573 --> 00:10:54,611
Study his every move.

118
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:57,350
YAMATO: As it turns out, she
was right to be concerned.

119
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:21,635
-You're kidding.

120
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:22,637
-It's amazing!

121
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:31,791
YAMATO: It's a good thing I
heeded Lady Tsunade's warning.

122
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,661
well, enough of that.

123
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:35,532
Go on and swallow them.

124
00:11:35,532 --> 00:11:36,014
-Right.

125
00:11:36,014 --> 00:11:36,716
Here goes.

126
00:11:53,886 --> 00:11:55,055
-All right.

127
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,494
If you two are ready,
then let's do it.

128
00:11:57,527 --> 00:11:58,051
-Yes, sir!

129
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:35,364
-I wonder--

130
00:12:35,398 --> 00:12:36,900
-Hm?

131
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:38,805
-Would it be possible
to meet the rest

132
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:40,341
of Orochimaru's subordinates?

133
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:42,211
The ones who are here?

134
00:12:47,356 --> 00:12:50,162
-There won't be
any need for that.

135
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:51,865
In fact, it's impossible.

136
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,917
That's because there are
no other people down here.

137
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,054
Just Sasuke and
myself, that's all.

138
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:34,891
-I can barely sense the
presence of anyone at all.

139
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:36,861
I think we can safely
assume there aren't

140
00:13:36,861 --> 00:13:40,369
very many of the enemy in there.

141
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:43,209
But that doesn't mean you
can let your guard down.

142
00:13:43,242 --> 00:13:46,115
Remember, one of
them is Orochimaru.

143
00:13:46,148 --> 00:13:49,289
And presumably, Sai
is with him now.

144
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:53,832
I will lead the way, followed
by Sakura, then Naruto.

145
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:56,304
-So how are we
gonna get in there?

146
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:57,906
-We'll infiltrate
from underground,

147
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,512
using my earth style jutsu.

148
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:03,819
We'll start by drilling
a main shaft right here.

149
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:05,323
When we've gone
deep enough, we'll

150
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:07,160
level off and tunnel
our way little

151
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:11,202
by little toward the entrance
under those standing rocks.

152
00:14:11,236 --> 00:14:12,805
-Right.

153
00:14:12,838 --> 00:14:15,544
-OK, sounds good to me.

154
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:17,181
-Well then, let's get started.

155
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:32,781
When I give the signal,
you follow one by one.

156
00:14:32,814 --> 00:14:33,783
In the order given.

157
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:41,800
[whistle]

158
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,170
-All right, Naruto, this is it.

159
00:14:43,204 --> 00:14:44,005
-Let's do it.

160
00:14:56,832 --> 00:15:00,474
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
We've finally found you.

161
00:15:00,507 --> 00:15:01,075
Sasuke.

162
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,262
-All right.

163
00:15:10,295 --> 00:15:11,163
Come on in.

164
00:15:24,892 --> 00:15:27,164
This will be your room.

165
00:15:27,197 --> 00:15:29,402
Sorry if it seems a
little bare and gloomy,

166
00:15:29,435 --> 00:15:31,974
but it can't be helped.

167
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:34,479
The bathroom's through there.

168
00:15:34,513 --> 00:15:37,385
When you don't have anything
to do, you'll stay in here

169
00:15:37,385 --> 00:15:38,989
and keep nice and quiet.

170
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:47,207
We'll be sure and let you
know if anything comes up.

171
00:15:51,449 --> 00:15:54,088
Of course, I'm going to
have to lock you in here,

172
00:15:54,122 --> 00:15:59,967
because after all, you're--
well, you know what you are.

173
00:16:48,537 --> 00:16:52,980
-As feared, the hideout's
surrounded by a wall of rock.

174
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,283
-What of it?

175
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:58,225
I can take that thing down with
one blast from my Rasengan.

176
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,962
Wait a minute.

177
00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:02,167
They'll know we're here
the minute you let loose

178
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,737
with a jutsu like that.

179
00:17:03,971 --> 00:17:05,206
-Huh?

180
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,113
-This infiltration has
to be done quietly.

181
00:17:08,113 --> 00:17:09,984
-Then what are we gonna do?

182
00:17:13,257 --> 00:17:13,748
-Here.

183
00:17:18,691 --> 00:17:23,635
The more solid the
rock, the less force

184
00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:26,742
need be applied
to a small crack.

185
00:17:26,776 --> 00:17:38,434
And-- There, you see?

186
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:41,440
Just like that.

187
00:17:41,473 --> 00:17:42,810
-Awesome.

188
00:17:42,843 --> 00:17:45,415
-Now, we all have to be
very careful to limit

189
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:47,787
our use of chakra from
this point forward.

190
00:17:47,821 --> 00:17:50,793
We don't want Orochimaru
sensing our presence.

191
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:52,363
OK, let's go.

192
00:18:01,282 --> 00:18:05,558
-A successful
infiltration so far.

193
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:07,195
-First we have to find Sai.

194
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:13,942
He's this way.

195
00:18:47,615 --> 00:18:48,884
-Better get to work.

196
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:52,225
If I don't get started
compiling that bingo book,

197
00:18:52,225 --> 00:18:53,895
Orochimaru will get angry again.

198
00:19:06,488 --> 00:19:07,690
Huh.

199
00:19:07,724 --> 00:19:10,229
If I keep this up, he'll
think people with blood type A

200
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:11,265
make better subordinates.

201
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,479
-Everything's clear up ahead.

202
00:19:42,832 --> 00:19:44,402
We're almost there.

203
00:20:32,472 --> 00:20:37,348

204
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:03,967
SAI: In the
Foundation, many of us

205
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:06,906
came from families
torn apart by war.

206
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,744
Because of that,
those who had survived

207
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:10,748
were brought even
closer together--

208
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:14,590
like my brother and I. I
always planned to give him

209
00:22:14,623 --> 00:22:18,431
this book of drawings, but
somehow, ever since that day,

210
00:22:18,464 --> 00:22:20,836
I haven't been able to remember
the picture I was going

211
00:22:20,836 --> 00:22:23,676
to draw on the final
page, even though it

212
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:27,016
was the picture I wanted
to show him the most.

213
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:30,223
Next time, Bonds.

SAKURA: Notable People
of the Leaf Village.

216
00:22:43,652 --> 00:22:46,524
Picking up where we left
off, let's take a look back

217
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:47,828
at Sasuke.

218
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:50,934
Back then, Sasuke seemed to
have forgotten about his role

219
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:52,237
as an avenger.

220
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:56,078
He was reminded of it when he
and Itachi had their reunion.

221
00:22:56,112 --> 00:22:59,719
-What have I been
doing all these years?

222
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,125
-You don't have enough hate.

223
00:23:02,158 --> 00:23:03,962
And you know something?

224
00:23:03,995 --> 00:23:05,766
You never will.

225
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:08,906
SAKURA: In order to gain
the power to defeat Itachi,

226
00:23:08,906 --> 00:23:12,112
Sasuke severed his ties to
his friends and his village,

227
00:23:12,146 --> 00:23:14,116
and went off to join Orochimaru.

228
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:17,223
-No matter what, I'm not going
to let the likes of Orochimaru

229
00:23:17,257 --> 00:23:18,526
get a hold of you!

230
00:23:18,526 --> 00:23:20,229
-What do you know about it?

231
00:23:20,263 --> 00:23:23,670
You never had a real
family in the first place!

232
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:26,911
SAKURA: Naruto was unable
to stop Sasuke, even when he

233
00:23:26,911 --> 00:23:28,391
put his very life on the line.

234
00:23:28,391 --> 00:23:32,262
And now, for all we know,
Sasuke is a willing vessel

235
00:23:32,262 --> 00:23:34,397
for Orochimaru.

236
00:23:34,397 --> 00:23:36,900
But even so, we'll get him back.

237
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:39,135
We'll get him back,
no matter what!

238
00:23:39,135 --> 00:23:41,237
See ya next time.
