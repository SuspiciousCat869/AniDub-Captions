{\an1}So, I guess this is
the Ultimate Summoning
Animal.

00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,280
{\an1}Yeah, well, it just looks
like a giant greedy
monster to me.

152
00:15:11,313 --> 00:15:13,880
Should one of us enter
into a contract with it?

153
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,815
{\an1}I don't think it cares
about that...

That's spider silk!

{\an1}It got that skill from
the spider it consumed!

{\an1}Huh? Huh?!

161
00:15:42,454 --> 00:15:43,722
It's hungry!

{\an1}Starving. No matter how
much it manages to consume...

00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:51,557
{\an1}The only thing it
knows is its needs to
devour everything!

{\an1}Not such a great Ultimate
Summoning Animal, then,
is it?!

my Chakra!

{\an1}That's how it was
designed to fight
shinobi!

171
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,230
{\an1}Don't worry! I'll
pulverize it with Sage
