00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,017
-Now what's going on?

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,352
The reanimation jutsu.

4
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:19,286
It's wearing off!

5
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:28,462
-So that must mean the other
squad defeated the enemies

6
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:29,530
then, right?

7
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:30,664
-Yeah.

8
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,765
Let's hope so.

9
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,367
-I think we're going to be OK.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,869
-I wouldn't go that far.

11
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:36,703
-Huh?

12
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:37,404
What's happening?

13
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,967
[cheering]

14
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:07,935
-We have done it!

15
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:09,703
The jutsu is fading away!

16
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,673
-The Leaf village is
still standing strong.

17
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:13,473
-Nah.

18
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:15,075
Shikamaru was right.

19
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,610
It could be a diversion.

20
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,046
I wouldn't start
celebrating just yet.

21
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,347
-This ain't over.

22
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,449
There's a much
bigger jutsu coming.

23
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,619
Konohamaru said they had a way
to toast the whole village.

24
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:28,255
-Hey, whatever happened
to Yamato and Sakura?

25
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,958
Didn't they leave to
help Asuma-sensei?

26
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,693
-No word back from Sakura?

27
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:34,094
-No, nothing.

28
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,896
-Well, that doesn't sound good.

29
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:36,597
-Shikamaru.

30
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,031
-Huh?

31
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:40,968
-We have to assume that the
village is still in jeopardy.

32
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:44,137
So, for the moment, we should
treat the reanimation jutsu

33
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,339
ending as a trick.

34
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,274
They want us to
let our guard down.

35
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:47,774
-All right.

36
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:48,942
Got it.

37
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:50,911
So we need to locate
either Sakura and Yamato,

38
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,646
or the enemies themselves.

39
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:53,680
-That's correct.

40
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:55,816
Now go put together a team.

41
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,052
I want you to
investigate the village.

42
00:01:59,086 --> 00:01:59,586
-Yeah.

43
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,153
Sure thing.

44
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,293

[cries]

47
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,116
-Looks like the first
three are in position.

48
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,419
If Kitane makes it to
his, then that'll be it.

[theme music]

50
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:58,965
-Sora!

51
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,400
Surpass your father.

52
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,701
Crush him!

53
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:04,571
You were chosen for this power.

54
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:08,375
Power that Kazuma
was unworthy of.

55
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,912
-Shut your filthy mouth.

56
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:13,113
-This village.

57
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:13,780
[groan]

58
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:14,948
-Asuma.

59
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,316
-Ahh.

60
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,150
-Your father!

61
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:22,923
-That's right.

62
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,591
Your worthless
father was pathetic.

63
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,729
Huh?

64
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:33,967
-If you insult my
father anymore--

65
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:37,571
-If I insult him,
you're going to do what?

66
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,873
-I won't forgive you.

67
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,741
-Won't forgive me?

68
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,910
What do I care about that?

69
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:47,447
-My father would never have
wanted such a massacre.

70
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,350
Neither do I. I will stop you!

71
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:56,990
-Massacre.

72
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:01,194
But Sora, isn't that
exactly why you were born?

73
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:02,028
-Huh?

74
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,231
W-- What are you talking about?

75
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:05,465
-Really now.

76
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:06,433
Look at that arm.

77
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:13,573
Admit it.

78
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,509
You've got the
hand of a monster.

-I didn't think you'd go
down so easily, little boy.

85
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,567
What a shame.

-You're mine.

105
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,131
Argh!

00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,466
-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

-A little late!

108
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:54,407
-The clones are pointless with
the original all locked up.

109
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,910
So much for your diversion.

110
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:57,811
-Sorry.

111
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:58,979
No diversion, lady.

112
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:03,216
This time, the real
one was the bait.

113
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:03,717
-Huh?

114
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,186

-Yes!

117
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:16,529
I did it!

118
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:17,397
-Not yet.

119
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,264
It isn't over.

120

-What the heck is
wrong with her?

121
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,974
I don't get it.

122
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,342
What happened?

123
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,045
-How dare you do
that to my body?

124
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,815
Not just once, but
twice you've done it.

Reaper Transfer.

126
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,321
Well, boy.

00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,723
Nothing average
about you, is there?

128
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:44,524
-Her wounds.

129
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,292
They're gone!

130
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:46,926

Hold on, here.

145

Before I hit her
with the Rasengan,

146
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,436
she was using lightning.

147

Then after she fixed her
arm, it was water style.

-Wait a second.

I've got it.

150
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,844
I know what you're doing.

151
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,512
You're switching bodies.

00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:40,613
-Huh?

153
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,916
-That's how you can
use so many elements!

154
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,018
-You certainly are
clever, but the knowledge

155
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,519
won't help you any.

156
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:47,253
Water Style.

00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,421

-I can't allow anyone who
knows my secret to live.

00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,311
In exchange, I'll
be taking your body.

165
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,213
Or would you rather die?

166
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,582
-You wish.

00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,716
-Hmm?

00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,870

00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:03,196

[laughter]

181
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:09,369
-Now that I think of it,
your chakra is wind natured,

182
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,737
isn't it?

183
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,306
There aren't many people
who possess that element.

184
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,008

186
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,517

187
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,152

190
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,896
What a weird jutsu.

191
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:36,763

-Heh!

195
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:41,635
Ha!

196
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:42,435

-This is what happened
the last time.

203
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,624
You were way more freaked
out about your hair than you

204
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:06,760
were about your
body, which means

205
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:10,764
there must be something
special about it.

206
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:14,200
-Now that it's
come to this, I'll

207

no matter what.

208
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:21,708
-Ha!

209
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,577
-I'll suck the life
right out of you.

210
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:28,682
-Are you crazy?

211
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,925

-Well, that was something.

222
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,738
Sora.

223
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:25,438
Wait for me.

224
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,211
-Wind Style.

225
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:31,878

[grunt]

227
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,599
-Have you heard of
the real monster

228
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:55,201
that attacked this village,
almost completely annihilating

229
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:56,102
it?

230
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:59,406
The nine-tailed fox spirit.

231
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,908
-Nine-tailed fox spirit?

232
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,144
-It's not the only one, either.

233
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,679
There are several tailed beasts.

234
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:10,583
And we humans have sought them
throughout all of history,

235
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:13,953
in the hopes of obtaining the
massive amounts of power each

236
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,321
of them hold.

237
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,690
The purpose is clear, I'm sure.

238
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,859
To use them as weapons.

239
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:20,960
[gasp]

240
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,929
-Those who claimed the
beasts for their own

241
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:26,499
would have the whole
world beneath them.

242
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,369
The nations poured
themselves into research,

243
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:33,506
and eventually a way was
found to control them.

244
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,910
By taking the tailed beasts
and sealing them away inside

245
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:37,677
of someone.

246
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,779
-Huh?

247
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:44,317
-Those with beasts sealed within
them are called Jinchuriki.

248
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,587
The nations all
scrambled to acquire one.

249
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,024
And then the chance finally
arose for the Leaf village

250
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,126
to obtain one as well.

251
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,629
Almost 15 years ago.

252
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:59,199
The Nine-Tails fell
upon the village,

253
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,335
and the Fourth Hokage
sealed it within a baby,

254
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:05,839
giving the Leaf its
Jinchuriki at last.

255
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:10,110
And the Leaf's chance
was our chance as well.

256
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,645
We managed to harvest
some of the chakra that

257
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:16,049
was expelled from
the Nine-Tails.

258
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,383
It was tricky.

259
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:21,721
Its chakra couldn't
be sealed right away.

260
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,657
It took us five years to
implant it into the boy

261
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:27,160
that we had selected.

262
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,261
-You mean--

263
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,262
-That's right.

264
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,064
You're that boy, Sora.

265
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,532
It's you.

266
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:35,668
You're a simulated Jinchuriki.

267
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,270
-But when was I--

268
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,806
-Jinchuriki you're
not, but your power

269
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,342
is nearly comparable
to the original.

270
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,843
-When was I--

271
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:46,012
-Right from the beginning.

272
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:50,316
-You were born to be
a harbinger of death.

273
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,118
You're the weapon
that we forged.

274
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:57,223
-It can't be.

275
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:59,592
-You probably don't
remember this, Sora,

276
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,162
but when the chakra was
sealed inside of your body,

277
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:05,064
you lost total
control and ran amok.

278
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,867
You lurched about in a
frenzy and completely

279
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:11,271
obliterated the mighty
walls of the Fire Temple.

280
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,505

[groaning]

289
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,946
-It's the same old question.

290
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,015
What does a king really
mean to its people?

291
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,830
-Asuma.

292
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:46,766
If I were to ask you
who the king was,

293
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,068
what would your answer be?

294
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,803
-Well, that's easy.

295
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:53,706
It'd have to be either the
Feudal Lord or the Hokage.

296
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:59,946
But the way I see it, we should
only have one king to protect,

you still don't get it, do you?

with you, I probably

felt the same way
as Kazuma back then.

that could burn
down the village?

342
00:22:07,777 --> 00:22:08,544
-Not to worry.

343
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,645
It's been taken care of.

344
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,414
Both their diversion
and their main operation

345
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:13,849
have been completely
shut down by our people.

346
00:22:13,883 --> 00:22:15,351
-Beautiful.

347
00:22:15,384 --> 00:22:18,320
Now we just round up
the stragglers-- ah!

348
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,226
-Something wrong, my lady?

349
00:22:21,226 --> 00:22:22,961
-What is that red light?

350
00:22:22,995 --> 00:22:23,929
-Next time.

351
00:22:23,962 --> 00:22:25,330
Despair.
