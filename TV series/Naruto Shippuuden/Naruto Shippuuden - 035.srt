bring him back.

Sasuke Uchiha's retrieval.

but there's something
familiar about him.

kind of remind me of Sasuke.

they're finally here.

164
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,391
TSUNADE: Kakashi, may we enter?

165
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,158
-Come on in.

166
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:44,370
-Ha, long time, no see, Kakashi.

167
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,639
-You?

168
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:52,245
So, this is the Yamato you
were talking about, go figure.

169
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,580
-That's right.

170
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:56,115
While I'll be filling in
as interim captain for Team

171
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:00,520
Kakashi, Yamato is going
to be my code name, sir.

172
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,456
-You don't say.

173
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,326
-Which leads me to why
I brought him here.

174
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:09,128
If he's to be heading
up your team, Kakashi,

175
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:13,533
I want him to know exactly
what he'll be dealing with.

176
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,969
-What we're about to tell
you is the main reason

177
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:20,006
you were selected as
Kakashi's replacement.

178
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,474
-Is this about Naruto, sir?

179
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,965
-Exactly.

180
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:31,150
[music playing]

181
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:34,587
KAKASHI: You already know that
Naruto has the Nine-Tailed Fox

182
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,423
Spirit sealed inside
of him, right?

183
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,592
YAMATO: I do.

184
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,728
-There are times when the
Nine-Tails chakra will

185
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,264
start to leak out
of Naruto's body

186
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:47,000
and take on the
Fox Spirit's form.

187
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:51,104
We've been referring to it
as the Nine-Tails Cloak.

188
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,106
-The Nine-Tails Cloak?

189
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:57,443
My god, how often has this
been happening to him?

190
00:12:57,477 --> 00:13:00,580
-As recently as
our last mission.

191
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,183
[music playing]

192
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,128
When he's overcome
by his emotions,

193
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:18,431
the Fox Spirit's chakra
begins to surface,

194
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:23,469
engulfing his entire body and
revealing the Nine-Tails Cloak.

195
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,513
Just before the
second tail formed,

196
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,382
I was able to suppress
the chakra with a seal

197
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:39,652
that Master Jiraiya gave me.

198
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:43,990
If I hadn't intervened, who
knows what might have happened.

199
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,765
-I see, so it's
just as I feared.

200
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:57,537
-Judging by the shape the chakra
was taking, the number of tails

201
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,639
will probably grow.

202
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,476
And eventually,
there will be nine.

203
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:11,984
-That about sums it up.

204
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:16,022
-Master Jiraiya, how
many tails have you seen?

205
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:22,528
-Hm, in all my years of living,
I've come close to death

206
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,130
only twice.

207
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,700
The first time, I broke
six ribs, both arms,

208
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:31,237
and ruptured a handful
of internal organs.

209
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,674
That was when I was caught doing
"research" at a hot spring,

210
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:39,245
and Tsunade beat me like a drum.

211
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,214
The second time--

212
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:46,519
[music playing]

213
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,689
The second was back when
Naruto and I were off

214
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,992
training together and
the fourth tail appeared.

215
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,923
-I'm off.

216
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,589
[crowd noise]

SAKURA: My lady--

218
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,136
-Huh?

219
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,504
-What is it, Sakura?

220
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,039
You still have some
time before you

221
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,408
have to meet up with
the others, right?

222
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,676
-Yes, ma'am.

223
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,580
I was hoping to have a few
words with you before we depart.

224
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,448
-I see.

225
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,616
Well, your timing is perfect.

226
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,187
There's actually something
I wanted to ask you about.

227
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,422
-What is it?

228
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,190
-It's about Sai.

229
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,263
-Ah, I see.

230
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,138
So, it's that bad already?

231
00:16:07,193 --> 00:16:08,633
-Yeah.

232
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,473
TSUNADE: Why am I not surprised?

233
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:16,542
Well, you'll just have to
keep Naruto on a shorter leash

234
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,110
than usual.

235
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,412
-Yes, of course ma'am.

236
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,747
I'll do what I can.

237
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,623
-Hm?

-Who's that?

-Well Danzo, what do you want?

244
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,040
-I am just curious,
were you were

245
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:50,476
able to assign a
distinguished Black Ops

246
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:55,281
operative to lead young
Sai's unit, Princess Tsunade?

247
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:59,018
-An exemplary shinobi with
experience from as far back

248
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,554
as the Third Hokage's rule.

249
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,122
-Very well.

250
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:06,359
I just hope he's not
too deeply rooted

251
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:11,163
in the pacifism of that
pushover, Sarutobi.

252
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,499
The gutless teachings
of the Third,

253
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:18,504
who hated all manner
of disagreement--

254
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,574
just as the Third
Hokage was rooted

255
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:25,108
in the teachings of
your grandfather.

256
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:26,352
-Huh.

257
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,253
-Well, in any
case, I'm relieved.

258
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:43,529
Now I can enjoy my
meals in relative peace.

-Who was he?

263
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:12,992
TSUNADE: Someone who, long ago,
competed with the late Sarutobi

264
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:17,029
Sensei for the seat of Hokage.

265
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,398
They were polar opposites.

266
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:23,202
He's the founder of a hard-line
marshal faction, founded

267
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,304
on rigid principles.

268
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:28,007
He's also Sai's superior.

269
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,109
As a student of the
moderate Third Hokage,

270
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:34,213
and granddaughter of the
First, he actively despises me.

Don't want to be late.

-No, ma'am.

You know that, don't you?

00:22:04,237 --> 00:22:06,305
Well look, I'll
give you a choice.

You can either let me
cram your sorry butts

into a cage for 24 hours,
or you can spend the night

relaxing in some hot springs.

It's your call.

And trust me, I prefer the
kinder, gentler approach,

draconian methods, if need be.

Welcome, everyone.

303
00:22:44,777 --> 00:22:47,046
When we think of
fall, we think of art,

304

stuffing our faces,
and above all,

305

really good book.

00:22:51,317 --> 00:22:54,053

best-sellers around.

308

We'll start off
with this gem, which

309
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,026
I'm sure you all know,
"Make Out Paradise,"

310
00:23:00,026 --> 00:23:02,028
a landmark in
romantic literature

311
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:04,397
that has grabbed the hearts
of men across the land.

[chuckle]

313
00:23:05,464 --> 00:23:08,267
Next is "Make Out
Violence," a classic.

314
00:23:08,301 --> 00:23:11,437
It's a highly realistic, yet
dynamic, piece of lyricism,

315
00:23:11,437 --> 00:23:13,272
born out of meticulous research.

316
00:23:13,306 --> 00:23:15,675
And then, of course,
it's the much ballyhooed

317
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,510
"Make Out Tactics!"

over the movie deal.

-Come on, Pervy Sage.

The only books you're
showcasing here are you own!
