1
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,212
{\an1}We've received word
from the Fourth Company.

2
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:14,348
{\an1}It seems Lord Danzo's
ANBU bodyguards
have been reanimated.

3
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:18,652
{\an1}Do you mean Torune and Foo?
They were listed as missing
in action.

4
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:21,255
{\an1}I believe so.

5
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:23,224
{\an1}So they were killed, then.

6
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:24,625
{\an1}Yes.

7
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,726
{\an1}Really? Both of them?

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,830
{\an1}Only Torune has
been confirmed.

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,132
{\an1}Notify every company!

10
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,835
{\an1}When he is found, he
must be sealed immediately.

11
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,805
{\an1}Is he actually
that formidable?

12
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,708
{\an1}Shikuro Aburame's son...

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:45,145
{\an1}If he's under the Reanimation
Jutsu, he might use a
Forbidden Jutsu.

14
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,617
{\an1}Get word to
Naruto as well!

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:53,355
{\an4}I wonder what happened
to Danzo's other
bodyguard, the one who's
called Foo.

16
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:57,157
{\an1}That's right. He belonged
to the Yamanaka Clan,
didn't he?

17
00:00:57,192 --> 00:01:02,062
{\an1}Yes. I didn't want
him to join the
foundation, but...

18
00:01:25,287 --> 00:01:26,655
{\an7}What's the matter?

19
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:29,090
{\an1}<i>[frustrated gritting]</i>

20
00:01:29,124 --> 00:01:32,527
{\an1}Even if it is a
Forbidden Jutsu, why
do you resist it?

21
00:01:32,561 --> 00:01:38,166
{\an1}No one from this
point on will
prohibit you.

22
00:01:50,178 --> 00:01:52,381
{\an1}Jar of Poison Jutsu!

23
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,791
{\an7}<i>[sinister chuckling]</i>
You certainly know
your stuff.

24
00:02:01,823 --> 00:02:07,363
{\an7}Now go on, finish it.

25
00:02:07,396 --> 00:02:11,133
{\an1}Damn it! Being forced
to use this jutsu...

26
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,683
{\an1}<i>[surprised breath]</i>
Excellent, good
job finding me.

27
00:04:05,716 --> 00:04:11,656
{\an1}My insects led me.

28
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:13,558
{\an1}Wait...Shino?

29
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:16,527
{\an1}Torune? Is that you, Torune?

30
00:04:16,561 --> 00:04:18,362
{\an1}Yes.

31
00:04:18,396 --> 00:04:22,433
{\an1}Judging by your appearance,
I can only assume you've
been reanimated.

32
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:24,202
{\an1}Yes.

33
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:27,639
{\an1}Which means...that you died.

34
00:04:27,673 --> 00:04:29,775
{\an1}That's right, unfortunately.

35
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:32,243
{\an1}What happened to
Lord Danzo?

36
00:04:32,276 --> 00:04:34,278
{\an1}I heard he died.

37
00:04:34,313 --> 00:04:38,383
{\an1}I see...So Madara
killed him in the end.

38
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:42,254
{\an1}The facts are slightly
different, but nevermind
that.

39
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:45,557
{\an1}Please tell me what
you're doing here.

40
00:04:45,591 --> 00:04:47,326
{\an1}The Jar of Poison Jutsu.

41
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:49,595
What is that?

42
00:04:49,628 --> 00:04:53,665
{\an1}Insects are rapidly
multiplying in this chasm.

43
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,568
{\an1}Do you remember
my Venomous Beetles?

44
00:04:56,602 --> 00:04:58,303
{\an1}I could never forget them.

45
00:04:58,337 --> 00:05:05,210
{\an1}Remember, you and I, we
both grew up together
like brothers.

46
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:12,719
{\an1}Gotten used to the
Academy yet?

47
00:05:12,752 --> 00:05:18,190
{\an1}Not yet. It's because
my class is so rowdy.

48
00:05:18,223 --> 00:05:20,827
{\an1}I prefer playing with
insects, like this.

49
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,765
{\an4}That's not gonna do.
In time you're going
to start being sent
out on missions.

50
00:05:25,798 --> 00:05:29,201
{\an1}And when you do, having
friends or not will make
a huge difference.

51
00:05:29,234 --> 00:05:32,739
{\an1}Torune, you didn't go
to the Academy, did you?

52
00:05:32,772 --> 00:05:36,543
{\an1}I didn't, because I'm
special, even within
the Clan.

53
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:39,646
{\an1}Special in what way?

54
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:49,455
{\an1}I guess it's time that
I told you about it.

55
00:05:49,489 --> 00:05:50,857
{\an1}My body is host...

56
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:59,132
{\an1}To nano-sized
Venomous Beetles with
very toxic poison.

57
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:02,201
{\an1}My body produces
antibodies for
the poison.

58
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:12,245
{\an1}But if the beetles infect
another host...they will
destroy its cells and kill it.

59
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:18,719
{\an1}But if the beetles infect
another host...they will
destroy its cells and kill it.

60
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,588
{\an1}Don't touch it!

61
00:06:20,621 --> 00:06:24,658
{\an1}These Venomous Beetles of
mine thrive inside
of living cells.

62
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:26,727
{\an1}They multiply and
destroy them.

63
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,331
{\an1}If their host dies,
the Venomous Beetles
will also die.

64
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:32,566
{\an1}Like a virus?

65
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,272
{\an1}Yes. These insects can only
survive for any length of
time inside me body.

66
00:06:38,305 --> 00:06:41,208
{\an1}That's why I can't
touch anyone.

67
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:46,380
{\an4}It's not that you didn't
go to the Academy, it's
that you can't go, that's
because...

68
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:47,514
{\an1}Yes, you're right.

69
00:06:47,548 --> 00:06:50,351
{\an1}But you're different
in that regard.

70
00:06:50,384 --> 00:06:54,154
{\an1}You must get used to
the Academy quickly,
and make friends.

71
00:06:54,188 --> 00:06:59,828
{\an1}<i>[mischievous giggling]</i>
Wahoo!

72
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:03,098
{\an1}Huh?

73
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,835
{\an1}Hey! There's a whole
lot of bugs on your
desk, you know!

74
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:08,302
{\an1}Yeah, he's right!

75
00:07:08,335 --> 00:07:09,638
{\an1}Just leave them alone.

76
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:12,439
{\an1}These are my insects,
they're very special.

77
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,410
{\an1}Oh! So you collect
bugs, huh?

78
00:07:15,443 --> 00:07:18,446
{\an1}Don't most people collect
rhinoceros or staghorn
beetles?

79
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,551
{\an1}Say, you know what we
should do? Throw these
bugs at the girls in class!

80
00:07:23,585 --> 00:07:27,355
{\an1}"Ahh," they'd all say.
Wouldn't it be fun
watching them scream?!

81
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:31,192
{\an1}These insects aren't
for that purpose.

82
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:32,794
{\an1}Aw, come on!
Bugs are bugs!

83
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,498
{\an1}Let's just do it!
Let's make them
scream, "ahh!"

84
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:41,503
{\an1}And who are you
gonna make scream,
Naruto?

85
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:46,741
{\an1}<i>[distant yelling]</i>

86
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:49,477
{\an1}I don't understand
friendship.

87
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:53,314
{\an1}The reason is because
everyone is so different.

88
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:57,352
{\an7}Even if people are different,
if they spend time together,
aren't they friends?

89
00:07:57,385 --> 00:08:01,724
{\an1}Well then, I'd have
to consider my entire
class friends.

90
00:08:01,757 --> 00:08:04,126
{\an1}But it's not like that.

91
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,231
{\an1}You know, you
analyze things
too much.

92
00:08:10,265 --> 00:08:14,302
{\an1}Dad...

93
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:16,839
{\an1}Is that boy holding
the net your son?

94
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:17,873
{\an1}Yes.

95
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:21,310
{\an1}He's now at a suitable
age to enter the foundation.

96
00:08:21,343 --> 00:08:22,578
{\an1}Pardon?

97
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:26,282
{\an1}As you know, the
Foundation is where
ANBU agents are developed.

98
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:30,453
{\an5}Those who show great
promise are selected
when they're still
very young.

99
00:08:30,486 --> 00:08:37,259
{\an4}The Foundation's being
reorganized, and I would
like the Aburame Clan to
send us a candidate.

100
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:39,261
{\an1}Has Lord Third
approved this?

101
00:08:39,295 --> 00:08:44,167
{\an7}Recruiting for the Foundation
is wholly under my jurisdiction.

102
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:51,141
{\an4}Every Clan that possesses
a Hidden Jutsu, including the
Uchiha and Yamanaka Clans,
has sent someone to enlist.

103
00:08:51,174 --> 00:08:52,541
{\an1}Yes, but...Shino-

104
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:55,712
{\an1}If he is your son,
then he must be
exceptional.

105
00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:57,748
{\an1}<i>[conflicted reaction]</i>

106
00:08:57,781 --> 00:09:00,217
{\an1}What is this all
about, dad?

107
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:04,521
{\an1}Let me clear about it.
This is not a request,
it's an order.

108
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:07,124
{\an1}But that's...

109
00:09:07,157 --> 00:09:10,527
{\an1}If this man's looking
for someone exceptional,
will I do?

110
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,528
{\an1}Torune...

111
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:12,596
{\an1}You, boy?

112
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:15,532
{\an1}From the looks of you,
you aren't even a genin yet.

113
00:09:15,565 --> 00:09:17,601
{\an1}I'm the son of
Shikuro Aburame.

114
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:20,504
{\an1}I wasn't aware Shikuro
had a son.

115
00:09:20,537 --> 00:09:23,174
{\an1}As fate would have it,
we're his guardians.

116
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:28,179
{\an7}Hmm. Now I know
why you kept him
hidden. Interesting...

117
00:09:28,212 --> 00:09:33,683
{\an1}I have a few reservations,
but the foundation will
take this boy in.

118
00:09:33,717 --> 00:09:36,753
{\an1}I should tell you,
I can't be teamed
with anyone.

119
00:09:36,787 --> 00:09:38,588
Don't be arrogant.

120
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:43,293
{\an7}You're not the only
shinobi who possesses
a Secret Ninjutsu.

121
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:46,197
{\an1}In the morning,
you will come
to visit me.

122
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:51,301
{\an1}Understood.

123
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:53,370
{\an1}Torune, you
sure about this?

124
00:09:53,403 --> 00:09:58,142
{\an1}It's not like joining
the Foundation
will kill me.

125
00:09:58,176 --> 00:10:00,878
{\an1}But we won't be
able to see each
other anymore.

126
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:02,680
{\an1}This is goodbye.

127
00:10:02,713 --> 00:10:05,483
{\an1}But why, Torune?

128
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:10,221
{\an4}Entering the Foundation
means abandoning
your past, as well
as your future.

129
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:10,855
{\an1}I wanna say...

130
00:10:10,888 --> 00:10:11,689
{\an1}<i>[surprised breath]</i>

131
00:10:11,722 --> 00:10:15,626
{\an1}Thank you for
everything
until now.

132
00:10:19,797 --> 00:10:23,534
{\an1}Those Venomous Beetles are
lethal, but only transmitted
by touch.

133
00:10:23,568 --> 00:10:26,271
{\an1}What is the point of
a jutsu such as this?

134
00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:29,774
{\an1}The Jar of Poison Jutsu
requires a large amount
of flesh.

135
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:32,311
{\an1}That's why it's
considered a
Forbidden Jutsu.

136
00:10:32,343 --> 00:10:35,280
{\an1}But I was able to
gather many bodies
from the battlefield.

137
00:10:35,314 --> 00:10:39,617
{\an4}With this many cells,
the insects won't die.
They'll just keep
multiplying.

138
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,587
{\an1}And then, as the decaying
flesh releases gases...

139
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,357
{\an1}Of course...The gas.

140
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,861
{\an1}In the next phase,
the gas will be ignited.

141
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:52,396
{\an1}The cells carrying my
Venomous Beetles will
scatter on the wind...

142
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:57,536
{\an1}...and infect everyone
in the surrounding area.

143
00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:00,472
{\an1}That's the Forbidden Jar
of Poison Jutsu.

144
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:03,508
{\an1}So it doesn't discriminate
between friend and foe.

145
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:07,347
{\an4}Hurry, call for
reinforcements.
You can't stop
me alone.

146
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:10,582
{\an1}You're wrong. I'm
probably the only
one who can.

147
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:14,820
{\an1}It's useless. I underwent
very rigorous training
at the Foundation.

148
00:11:14,853 --> 00:11:19,292
{\an1}Yes, I know that all
of you in the Foundation
are quite skilled.

149
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:23,562
{\an1}I never thought it possible,
but I actually made a friend
in the Foundation.

150
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:32,404
{\an7}Hidden Jutsu: Beetle Sphere!

151
00:11:32,437 --> 00:11:37,609
{\an1}Foo...

152
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:40,479
{\an1}<i>[determined breath]</i>

153
00:11:40,512 --> 00:11:42,514
{\an1}Did you ever make friends?

154
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:43,616
{\an1}[shocked gasp]

155
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:49,756
{\an1}Shino...?

156
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:57,563
{\an1}I don't really know
if I have any friends.

157
00:11:57,597 --> 00:12:01,634
{\an1}That's because I'm not sure
that they consider me to
be their friend,

158
00:12:01,668 --> 00:12:03,703
{\an1}You're still
over-analyzing.

159
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:07,473
{\an1}To me, it's merely
viewing things
accurately.

160
00:12:07,507 --> 00:12:10,777
{\an1}I think it was good
that I joined the
Foundation.

161
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:16,216
{\an4}With my physical constitution,
I couldn't be an ordinary
shinobi doing ordinary
missions.

162
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,820
{\an1}However, the Foundation's
ANBU was quite a good
fit for me.

163
00:12:20,853 --> 00:12:24,391
{\an1}As someone who uses a
Secret Ninjutsu.

164
00:12:24,925 --> 00:12:29,263
{\an1}Making contact with your
opponent is the basis of
your jutsu.

165
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:32,166
{\an1}I want to see your
taijutsu skills.

166
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:35,302
{\an1}So I'm going to
have you spar with Foo.

167
00:12:35,336 --> 00:12:37,404
{\an1}But sir...my body
will be-

168
00:12:37,438 --> 00:12:40,473
{\an1}Lord Danzo told me
about you.

169
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:43,877
{\an1}The main thing is just
to avoid touching
your skin, right?

170
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:46,613
{\an1}Not that you'll
be able to touch me.

171
00:12:46,647 --> 00:12:48,315
{\an1}What's that?

172
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:51,453
{\an1}Just remember, you joined
the Foundation today.

173
00:12:51,485 --> 00:12:52,653
{\an1}Don't think you're
my equal.

174
00:12:52,686 --> 00:12:54,822
{\an1}<i>[frustrated reaction]</i>

175
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:56,190
{\an1}Begin.

176
00:12:56,223 --> 00:13:01,396
{\an1}<i>[battle cry]</i>

177
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:06,600
{\an1}You call that
being on guard?

178
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:10,205
{\an1}If I were fighting
seriously, you'd
be dead.

179
00:13:10,238 --> 00:13:14,175
{\an1}Lord Danzo needs to assess
you. He wants to know your
true strength.

180
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:15,876
{\an1}So you have to
fight seriously.

181
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:18,346
{\an1}Now come on!

182
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:23,184
{\an1}You're nothing but talk!

183
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:25,186
{\an1}You may show him.

184
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,288
{\an1}Sir!

185
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:37,866
{\an1}<i>[yelling in attack]</i>

186
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:39,300
{\an1}There you go.

187
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:43,204
{\an1}<i>[defeated reaction]</i>

188
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:44,539
{\an1}Stop. That's enough.

189
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:45,907
{\an1}Damn!

190
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,446
{\an1}From this moment on, the
both of you are going to
form a two-man cell.

191
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:53,581
{\an1}Foo, teach Torune
everything about the
Foundation.

192
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:54,883
{\an1}Yes, sir.

193
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,584
{\an1}I'm with him?!

194
00:13:56,618 --> 00:14:03,558
{\an4}The Mind Transfer Jutsu
and the Venomous Beetle
Jutsu should pair well
with each other.

195
00:14:03,591 --> 00:14:05,394
{\an1}<i>[surprised gasp]</i>

196
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,311
{\an1}Shino, do you know
what has happened
to Foo?

197
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:24,346
{\an1}I don't.

198
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,850
{\an1}You were both listed as
being missing in action.

199
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:29,285
{\an1}I see...

200
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:32,288
{\an7}Maybe Foo's been
reanimated as
well, then.

201
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:35,925
{\an7}We have no reports
about that.

202
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,361
{\an7}Shino, why waste time
listening to my old stories?

203
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:46,635
{\an7}You haven't called for
help. Just how do you
intend to stop me?

204
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:50,806
{\an1}I know you're only
trying to buy time.

205
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:59,316
{\an1}The reason is because
the insects require more
time to multiply.

206
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:07,457
{\an1}You intend to die here
with me...But that's futile!

207
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,526
{\an1}You cannot attempt
close combat with me.

208
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:13,163
{\an1}If I can't use my
beetles, then I must.

209
00:15:13,196 --> 00:15:16,800
{\an4}Get men skilled in
long-distance
fighting! And
Sealing Jutsu!

210
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:26,543
{\an1}I don't know anyone
like that nearby.

211
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:35,285
{\an1}Shino!

212
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:37,254
{\an1}<i>[grunt]</i>
Naruto!

213
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:39,256
{\an1}Well, kinda. I'm a clone.

214
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:41,791
{\an1}I came over here because
I sensed your chakra.

215
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:45,829
{\an1}Is that the guy HQ
sent the message about?

216
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,765
{\an1}I'm impressed that you
recognized my chakra.

217
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:51,636
{\an1}Yeah, I learned how
in my training!

218
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:53,870
{\an1}No, I didn't mean
it that way.

219
00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:56,873
{\an1}Shino, don't let
him attack recklessly.

220
00:15:56,907 --> 00:15:59,709
{\an1}All I have to do is
pulverize this guy, right?

221
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,283
{\an1}The Venomous Beetles would
scatter everywhere. And our
opponent's reanimated.

222
00:16:05,316 --> 00:16:07,618
{\an1}We must seal him
to beat him.

223
00:16:07,652 --> 00:16:12,290
{\an1}Don't touch him, the reason
is because his Venomous Beetles
will infect you.

224
00:16:12,323 --> 00:16:14,492
{\an1}But not only by touch...

225
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:17,862
{\an1}Poison Cloud Jutsu!

226
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,131
{\an1}<i>[inhale]</i>

{\an1}Get back! Don't
inhale no matter what!

228
00:16:31,842 --> 00:16:34,245
{\an1}Touching or breathing
them does that.

229
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:36,881
{\an1}Naruto, do you posses
a Sealing Jutsu?

230
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:39,418
{\an1}No, I don't. You don't
have one either?

231
00:16:39,451 --> 00:16:45,524
{\an1}I've been given some sealing
tags. But, what I don't have
now is a way to apply them.

232
00:16:45,557 --> 00:16:49,528
{\an1}Get rid of those
tags, Shino!

233
00:16:49,561 --> 00:16:52,231
{\an1}I'll be forced to
destroy anyone who
gets in my way.

234
00:16:52,264 --> 00:16:55,167
{\an1}My body will just
attack on its own!

235
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,936
{\an1}I'm not gonna let you
lay a single finger
on Shino.

236
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,173
{\an1}I'm gonna stop all
your attacks!

237
00:17:01,206 --> 00:17:04,509
{\an1}You're the one who can't
lay a single finger on
him, Naruto.

238
00:17:04,543 --> 00:17:05,310
{\an1}That's because-

239
00:17:05,344 --> 00:17:07,813
{\an1}I get it, and I'm
sure you're right.

240
00:17:07,846 --> 00:17:10,182
{\an1}You had better watch
out, Jinchuriki.

241
00:17:10,215 --> 00:17:12,384
{\an1}The Assassination Jutsu

00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:21,287
{\an1}Shino...?

260
00:18:21,321 --> 00:18:25,392
{\an1}Now as insect users, let's
settle this, just the two
of us!

261
00:18:25,426 --> 00:18:27,761
{\an1}Shino, how did you manage
to survive that?

262
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:31,432
{\an1}You...You touched the
Venomous Beetles!

263
00:18:31,465 --> 00:18:36,704
{\an7}No, I didn't touch them.
Your beetles touched mine.

264
00:18:36,737 --> 00:18:41,809
{\an1}You were like an
older brother to me.

265
00:18:41,841 --> 00:18:47,880
{\an7}<i>I wanted a keepsake of</i>
<i>you, so I nurtured and</i>
<i>bred my own Venomous</i>
<i>Beetles.</i>

266
00:18:47,914 --> 00:18:51,552
{\an7}<i>I raised them by</i>
<i>feeding them my</i>
<i>insects.</i>

267
00:18:51,585 --> 00:18:54,722
{\an7}Years later, after many
generations of offspring...

268
00:18:54,755 --> 00:19:00,894
{\an7}<i>...insects with antibodies</i>
<i>against the Venemous Beetles</i>
<i>were born.</i>

269
00:19:00,928 --> 00:19:03,464
{\an1}These are those insects.

270
00:19:03,497 --> 00:19:10,537
{\an4}With the antibody they
possess, touching your
Venomous Beetles won't
kill them.

271
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:15,242
{\an1}You may be an Insect User,
but no one can host an
insect as unique as that.

272
00:19:15,275 --> 00:19:18,546
{\an1}Especially not in this
large quantity.

273
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,182
{\an1}Yes. At first I only
carried about ten with me.

274
00:19:22,216 --> 00:19:24,452
{\an1}But when I got here,
I made them multiply.

275
00:19:24,486 --> 00:19:29,724
{\an4}Maybe it was the jutsu
barrier, but it took
less time than
I calculated.

276
00:19:29,758 --> 00:19:34,863
{\an1}Shino...you...

277
00:19:34,895 --> 00:19:37,465
{\an1}I know you're only
trying to buy time.

278
00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:42,470
{\an1}The reason is because
the insects require
more time to multiply.

279
00:19:42,504 --> 00:19:45,640
{\an1}You never miss a detail.

280
00:19:45,673 --> 00:19:51,546
{\an1}But it's different now.
You see...I'm not alone
amymore.

281
00:19:51,579 --> 00:19:56,184
{\an1}Forgive me. For
this seal.

282
00:19:56,217 --> 00:20:06,194
{\an1}No, you don't need
to apologize.

283
00:20:06,227 --> 00:20:16,906
{\an1}No, you don't need
to apologize.

284
00:20:16,938 --> 00:20:19,742
{\an1}Hey, Shino, what do
we do with everything here?

285
00:20:19,775 --> 00:20:24,847
{\an4}Don't worry. The Jutsu
User has been sealed.
Eventually these insects
will die.

286
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,250
{\an7}You mean this
is all over.

287
00:20:28,284 --> 00:20:30,419
{\an7}Please go, Naruto.

288
00:20:30,453 --> 00:20:32,621
{\an7}Kiba and Hinata
are that way.

289
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:43,799
{\an1}Right!

290
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,870
{\an1}Torune, I'm grateful.

291
00:20:46,903 --> 00:20:51,240
{\an7}I'm glad that I didn't
have to join the
Foundation.

292
00:20:51,273 --> 00:20:52,174
{\an7}It's because...

293
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,543
{\an1}Hey! What about
you, Shino?

294
00:20:54,577 --> 00:20:56,445
{\an1}Come on, hurry it up!

295
00:21:05,856 --> 00:21:15,832
{\an1}It's because, I got
to make friends.

296
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:25,909
{\an1}It's because, I got
to make friends.

297
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:35,852
{\an1}It's because, I got
to make friends.

298
00:21:35,886 --> 00:21:45,930
{\an1}It's because, I got
to make friends.

299
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:55,840
{\an1}It's because, I got
to make friends.

300
00:21:55,873 --> 00:22:05,917
{\an1}It's because, I got
to make friends.

301
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:15,860
{\an1}It's because, I got
to make friends.

302
00:22:15,893 --> 00:22:25,937
{\an1}It's because, I got
to make friends.

303
00:22:25,937 --> 00:22:35,846
{\an1}It's because, I got
to make friends.

304
00:22:35,881 --> 00:22:45,924
{\an1}It's because, I got
to make friends.

305
00:22:45,924 --> 00:22:56,768
{\an1}It's because, I got
to make friends.

306
00:22:56,802 --> 00:23:01,372
{\an1}<i>I've been told to leave</i>
<i>Naruto alone. However...</i>
<i>not Eight Tails.</i>

307
00:23:01,406 --> 00:23:04,743
{\an7}<i>I can't wait to conduct</i>
<i>Lord Orochimaru's tests</i>
<i>on him!</i>

308
00:23:04,776 --> 00:23:08,680
{\an7}<i>Bee, I'm going to</i>
<i>prepare the perfect</i>
<i>reanimation for you.</i>

309
00:23:08,714 --> 00:23:10,282
{\an1}Wait! He's...

310
00:23:10,315 --> 00:23:14,386
{\an1}You're the Eight Tails'
former Jinchuriki! Fukai!

311
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:19,925
{\an1}Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"A Hole in the Heart:
The Other Jinchuriki"

312
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:23,862
{\an1}<i>It certainly has</i>
