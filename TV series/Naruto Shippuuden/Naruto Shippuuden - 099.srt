3
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:38,572
Deidara, look at that.

4
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:39,706
A dumpling shop!

5
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,174
Let's take a breather.

6
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,142
Can we, can we?

7
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,577
We've been walking all day!

8
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,045
I'm totally exhausted!

9
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,683
‐You don't look
all that exhausted.

10
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,355
You're like a four‐year‐old
sometimes, you know that?

11
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,923
‐Aw, what's the rush?

12
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:58,892
We're trying to catch
one of the tailed beasts,

13
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,360
but we don't even
know where it is.

14
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:04,705
What's it going to hurt
if we kick back for a bit?

15
00:01:04,738 --> 00:01:07,473
by the way, which one
are we after, again?

16
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:09,308
‐The Three Tails!

17
00:01:09,342 --> 00:01:11,344
‐First we find him,
then we catch him.

18
00:01:11,377 --> 00:01:13,079
Just leave it to Tobi.

19
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:13,680
Okey dokey?

20
00:01:17,518 --> 00:01:18,051
Right?

21
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:19,052
‐Here you go.

22
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:20,787
Dumplings for two.

23
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:22,088
‐Wah ha!

24
00:01:22,122 --> 00:01:23,557
These look tasty.

25
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,527
Let's see, let's see.

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,493
Down the hatch.

27
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,737
Mm.

28
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,371
That is good!

29
00:01:38,404 --> 00:01:40,507
The sauce is out of this world!

30
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:43,176
Not too sweet, not too salty.

31
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:45,078
What a masterpiece.

32
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:47,848
Oh, that hit the spot, huh?

33
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:48,649
Wait.

34
00:01:48,682 --> 00:01:51,317
Deidara, get a load of this.

35
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:52,753
‐Hm?

36
00:01:52,786 --> 00:01:55,589
‐That looks exactly
like your work.

37
00:01:55,622 --> 00:01:56,122
Doesn't it?

38
00:01:59,492 --> 00:02:04,111
Could it be that your
art style is a rip off?

39
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:08,842
‐Tobi.

40
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:11,377
‐Wah!

41
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:12,679

What's going on?

47
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,692
‐The Three Tails is surfacing.

48
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:38,037
‐Wait a minute
What is this feeling?

49
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:38,605
‐Shino?

50
00:04:38,638 --> 00:04:40,006
What's wrong?

51
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,844
‐My insects are sensing
an abnormal chakra.

52
00:04:43,877 --> 00:04:45,779
‐An abnormal chakra?

53
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:48,649
‐They've never felt
so much all at once.

54
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:50,551
It's a massive amount.

[bark]

‐Yeah, same goes for
Akamaru, you guys.

57
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,022
He's picking up the
exact same thing.

58
00:04:56,056 --> 00:04:58,925
‐That means we must be
closing in on the place, huh?

59
00:04:58,959 --> 00:04:59,593
‐Let's move.

60
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,237
‐This feeling.

61
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,640
There's bloodlust in the air.

62
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,009
Crackling all around us.

63
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,277
And it's not the Leaf.

64
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,412
It's something else.

65
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,252
What's going on?

66
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,527
KAKASHI: Is that it?

67
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,694
‐What the heck is that?

68
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:28,629
Some kind of fog?

69
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,037
‐It appears to me like the
bats are flying right into it.

70
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,505
‐No question.

71
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,441
There's an ocean
of chakra in there.

72
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,543
‐From where?

73
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,010
Inside the fog?

74
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:44,711
‐Yeah.

75
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,813
But what's the source?

76
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,216
‐What do you say we all just
dive in there and find out?

77
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,653
‐One step at a time, all right?

78
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,622
We have to be prepared.

79
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:56,890
‐Just say the word.

80
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,025
‐Be ready for action, everyone.

81
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,667
I want you all on your toes.

82
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:01,735

[screeching]

‐Looks like there's even
more of them out there now.

87
00:06:22,455 --> 00:06:23,624
They call for reinforcements?

88
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,995
‐If they didn't know we
were coming, they do now!

89
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:30,531
‐It doesn't matter.

90
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:31,565
Keep going.

91
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:33,499
‐They've got us outnumbered.

92
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:34,968
We need to buy
ourselves some time

93
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:36,402
until Guren can get back here.

94
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:38,004
So Kiho, you're up.

95
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:39,239
Lay down some cover.

96
00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:40,541
‐Whatever you say, boss.

‐Kakashi, what is it?

98
00:06:54,187 --> 00:06:55,856
‐It's a smokescreen.

99
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,258
They were waiting for us.

100
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,260
We can't just rush in there.

101
00:07:00,293 --> 00:07:01,768
But if we hang back
too long, we'll

102
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:04,370
never find out what's
happening at that lake.

103
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:06,773
We have to split up.

104
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:09,175
Naruto, you'll be on your own.

105
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:09,810
‐What?

106
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:11,377
I'm not fighting?

107
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:13,847
‐Our main objective
is that lake.

108
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,748
‐Oh, yeah.

109
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:15,882
That's right.

110
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,518
‐We'll create a diversion
while you head off

111
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:19,853
to see what's happening
down there in the fog.

112
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:21,755
But you're not to engage.

113
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:22,288
‐Right.

114
00:07:22,322 --> 00:07:24,024
You got it.

115
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:25,458
‐You really think
it's a good idea

116
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:27,260
to send him out on his own?

117
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:28,595
‐I think he's earned our faith.

118
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:30,196
Don't you?

119
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,798
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Besides, no one

120
00:07:31,832 --> 00:07:35,268
is a better survivor than he is.

121
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:37,237
Good luck, Naruto.

122
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,707
That legendary unpredictability
is just what we need right now.

123
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:48,915
‐No reaction.

124
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:51,518
Seems no one's here.

‐This is great.

127

I can't see anything now.

128
00:08:02,803 --> 00:08:04,237
Think they already fled?

129
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,040
‐They're probably buying time.

130
00:08:07,073 --> 00:08:08,775
Keep your guard up.

131
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:11,177
‐All right, no more
waitin' around.

132
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:13,179
Time to take a closer look.

133
00:08:25,225 --> 00:08:27,060
Guess I went too deep there.

00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:29,563
‐Did ya bring some snacks?

135
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:32,899
‐We'd just gotten home, and
you had to call us up again.

136
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:35,636
You really like to crack
the whip, don't you?

‐Look, just help
me out, will ya?

138
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:39,472
I'll make it worth your while.

139
00:08:39,506 --> 00:08:42,876
‐The chakra around
here is pretty intense.

140
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,477
I wonder what's in this fog?

‐So this is the Three Tails?

00:09:24,858 --> 00:09:27,327
‐It's so much bigger
than we thought.

146
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,795
‐You sense it?

147
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:33,299
This feeling of dread?

148
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,801
‐Success.

149
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:36,603
We did it.

150
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:39,005
Yukimaru is controlling
the Three Tails!

151
00:09:42,943 --> 00:09:44,410
‐Yukimaru!

152
00:09:44,444 --> 00:09:45,245
‐Dammit.

153
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:46,880
If he keeps using his power‐‐

154
00:09:46,913 --> 00:09:50,316
‐What happens to the Three
Tails if he loses control?

155
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,788
‐Your job's to prevent that
from happening, remember?

[screaming]

157
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,258
KABUTO (VOICEOVER):
Even Yukimaru's power

158
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,760
isn't enough to control it.

159
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:05,084
‐Yukimaru.

Do you guys hear that?

00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:04,638
‐Guren!

164
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:05,772
Stop this behemoth!

from you, four eyes!

00:11:26,993 --> 00:11:28,461
‐Crystal Style!

171
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:29,963
Divine Pathway Jutsu!

172
00:11:34,935 --> 00:11:35,902
There we go.

173
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:48,148
It actually
shattered my crystal?

174
00:11:48,181 --> 00:11:50,150
Giant Crystal
Hexagonal Shuriken!

175
00:11:58,692 --> 00:12:00,634
Well, you're a tricky one.

176
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,135
Blasted turtle!

177
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:02,803
‐Guren!

178
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:04,304
What are you doing?

179
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:05,772
Trying to kill it?

180
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:09,475
You need to contain the Three
Tails, or we'll all be dead.

181
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,877
GUREN (VOICEOVER):
A jutsu of that

182
00:12:10,911 --> 00:12:12,613
scale is gonna need
some preparation.

183
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:24,424
I'm too late!

184
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:32,465
Gozu!

185
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:32,966
‐Hurry!

186
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:33,934
Do it!

187
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:41,808
‐Crystal Style!

188
00:12:41,842 --> 00:12:44,144
Crystal Wall, Eighth Formation!

189
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:46,079
Take that, you damn turtle!

190
00:12:53,587 --> 00:12:56,056
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): She did it.

191
00:12:56,089 --> 00:13:00,200
The Crystal Style‐‐ I never
knew Guren was this strong.

192
00:13:09,242 --> 00:13:11,912
‐I think I used too much chakra.

193
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:20,654
‐Watch it, Shino.

194
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:22,288
Don't get so close.

195
00:13:22,322 --> 00:13:24,891
‐Trust me, that's the
last thing I want.

196
00:13:24,925 --> 00:13:28,028
‐So why are you bumping me
with your shoulder, then?

197
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:29,262
‐Why?

198
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:32,699
Because our circle is
growing smaller, that's why.

199
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:34,568
‐Enough with all the chatter.

200
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:37,137
You should be focusing
on finding the enemy.

201
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,905
‐Yeah, but Kakashi‐sensei, he‐‐

202
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:39,873
HINATA: Above you!

203
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:40,373
Watch out!

204
00:13:40,406 --> 00:13:40,874
‐Huh?

205
00:13:45,378 --> 00:13:47,047
‐Our ambush failed.

206
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:52,653
‐Kakashi‐sensei!

207
00:13:52,686 --> 00:13:54,254
Thanks a lot, you two.

208
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:55,889
We owe you one.

209
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:57,057
‐Hinata!

210
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,292
You're feeling better already?

211
00:13:59,325 --> 00:14:00,093
‐Yeah.

212
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:05,860
‐But still, how did she‐‐ I see.

213
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:07,508
Your Byakugan.

214
00:14:10,777 --> 00:14:14,014
‐We'd better be careful around
that little girl's jutsu.

215
00:14:14,047 --> 00:14:18,051
Even with a smokescreen,
she can still find us.

216
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:20,486
Dammit.

217
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:22,856
NARUTO: What's with this place?

218
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:25,291
‐There's no signs
of fish anywhere.

219
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:27,694
And not a single wave in sight.

220
00:14:27,728 --> 00:14:30,030
It's really weird.

221
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:31,364
‐Huh?

222
00:14:31,397 --> 00:14:32,098
I see something.

223
00:14:42,475 --> 00:14:44,778
GAMATATSU: Hey, it's a turtle.

224
00:14:44,811 --> 00:14:46,813
There's a turtle inside.

225
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:51,417
Brother, what kinda
turtle is that?

226
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:55,121
‐Naruto, that's a
tailed beast in there.

227
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:56,289
‐Tailed beast?

228
00:14:56,322 --> 00:14:57,090
‐Yeah.

229
00:14:57,123 --> 00:14:58,291
It's the Three Tails.

230
00:15:12,513 --> 00:15:13,213
‐Three Tails.

[roaring]

232
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,472
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): Even a jutsu
like that couldn't stop it?

233
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:40,406
‐Guren!

234
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,308
Take Yukimaru and
get out of here.

235
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:43,276
You too, Gozu!

236
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:47,413
‐Gozu!

237
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,782
Protect Yukimaru!

238
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:49,315
‐All right.

239
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,752
You got it.

240
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:52,252
‐Guren!

241
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,757
‐This is our fight.

242
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,924
You hear me?

243
00:16:02,936 --> 00:16:03,870
‐That woman.

244
00:16:08,408 --> 00:16:10,343
What is she fighting
the Three Tails for?

245
00:16:14,915 --> 00:16:15,882
‐Be careful!

‐I don't get it.

00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,026
What are you doing here?

249
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,833
Don't tell me‐‐

250
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:36,537
‐Wherever somebody is thinking
of you, that place is home.

251
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:41,252
‐The place he wanted to turn
to all this time was with them?

252
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:46,179
‐Don't underestimate
me, you damn turtle!

253
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:52,052
‐Are you OK?

254
00:17:03,837 --> 00:17:06,439
‐Well, this one
will never wither,

255
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:08,842
as long as I'm
alive in this world.

256
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,344
‐Guren's safe.

00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:13,580
‐Gozu.

258
00:17:13,614 --> 00:17:16,082
What are you doing here?

259
00:17:16,116 --> 00:17:18,451
Take Yukimaru and go.

260
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:20,486
You have to hurry.

261
00:17:20,521 --> 00:17:22,188
‐Of course, Guren.

00:17:22,222 --> 00:17:25,158
[roaring]

263
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:39,339
‐I finally figured out where
I'm supposed to return to.

264
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:39,973

‐What happened?

267
00:18:02,903 --> 00:18:04,671
The Three Tails
has stopped moving.

268
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:06,573
‐It can't be.

269
00:18:06,607 --> 00:18:09,776
‐That kid‐‐ he's
controlling the Three Tails.

‐What the‐‐

‐Kakashi‐sensei.

‐Huh?

273
00:18:48,749 --> 00:18:49,783
‐I think that's‐‐

274
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:56,657
‐We've got trouble.

275
00:19:04,437 --> 00:19:06,272
GUREN (VOICEOVER): That's
the dimension where

276
00:19:06,306 --> 00:19:07,941
the Three Tails comes from.

277

If we're swallowed up by it‐‐

‐Hey, are you all right?

00:19:19,352 --> 00:19:20,887
‐It's so warm in here.

280
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:28,228
Here.

281
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:28,862
GUREN: Wait.

00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,766
That's‐‐ Yukimaru!

GUREN (VOICEOVER): I'll use
all my power for this jutsu.

TSUNADE: They say
the Three Tails

287
00:22:03,537 --> 00:22:05,471
vanished after the
last great war.

288
00:22:05,506 --> 00:22:07,273
No one's seen it since.

289
00:22:07,307 --> 00:22:10,243
Orochimaru is stirring
up something foul.

SHIZUNE: But we
discovered it in time.

291
00:22:12,045 --> 00:22:14,247
Perhaps it was a
blessing in disguise?

292

TSUNADE: Maybe.

293
00:22:15,481 --> 00:22:17,551
But we mustn't let it
fall into the wrong hands.

‐We'll capture it, then?

295
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:20,987
‐That's easier said than done.

296
00:22:21,021 --> 00:22:22,856
I'm going to do some research.
