1
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:15,197
In order to protect the
Yamanaka and Nara Clans
and the Hidden Leaf
Village, I, Choji

2
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:21,409
Akimichi swear to
transform from a lowly
caterpillar to a
powerful butterfly!

3
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:23,413
And take flight!

4
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:33,534
And it's simply this,
that I have nothing
left to say to you.

5
00:00:33,568 --> 00:00:38,410
<i>Your Ino-Shika-Cho</i>
<i>formation is</i>
<i>complete.</i>

6
00:00:40,848 --> 00:00:42,451
<i>Thank you...</i>

7
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:54,710
I'm going to
end this entire
battle right now.

8
00:00:54,743 --> 00:00:59,418
But I'll need you,
Shikamaru and Ino.
So please help me
out, okay?

9
00:00:59,452 --> 00:01:02,559
Y'know, Choji...
I've known you
practically forever
now...

10
00:01:02,592 --> 00:01:06,466
But I've never
seen you take
charge like this!

11
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:02,832
You're just not
getting it. Half-
hearted attention.

12
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:04,569
And not enough
preparation.

13
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:13,486
Sorry, something's
been bugging me for a
while, and I can't get
it out of my mind!

14
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:15,190
What is it?

15
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:19,766
Well... A while
ago, I thought that I
sensed the Nine Tails'
chakra, you know?

16
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,473
But there's no way
that somebody else
has the Nine Tails'
chakra right?

17
00:03:23,507 --> 00:03:25,410
So I don't know
what it was...

18
00:03:25,444 --> 00:03:30,888
Must've imagined it.
'Cause chakra here is
entirely cut off, both
inside and out.

19
00:03:30,922 --> 00:03:35,230
And Nine Tails is
only inside you.
It's a bad joke,
no doubt.

20
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:40,474
Naruto's beginning
to figure things out.
The Gold and Silver
Brothers also possess

21
00:03:40,508 --> 00:03:46,185
the Nine Tails' chakra.
Which would mean that
Orochimaru's jutsu has
reanimated them.

22
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:52,064
However, he has the
power to perceive the
chakra more intensely
in this room.

23
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:57,441
We can't fool him
much longer. What'll
you do, Bee? You
have to do something.

24
00:03:57,474 --> 00:03:59,044
Like what?

25
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:02,184
<i>What do you mean?</i>
<i>Weren't you paying</i>
<i>attention to the plan?</i>

26
00:04:02,217 --> 00:04:04,355
<i>You can't let Naruto</i>
<i>out of this space!</i>

27
00:04:04,388 --> 00:04:06,860
But that's what
you're here for
Eight-O!

28
00:04:06,894 --> 00:04:10,267
<i>What? Damn it.</i>

29
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,643
Uh, where's
the bathroom?

30
00:04:14,676 --> 00:04:17,749
The first doorway
on the left, outside.
You can't miss it.

31
00:04:17,782 --> 00:04:21,623
<i>You idiot! He'll</i>
<i>escape the space</i>
<i>go with him!</i>

32
00:04:21,657 --> 00:04:22,959
Ohh...

33
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,403
Don't panic!
Contact HQ!

34
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:31,543
What's that? The Nine
Tails is attempting
to escape?!

35
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:33,480
And what's Bee
doing about it?!

36
00:04:33,514 --> 00:04:38,256
Well, sir, Lord Bee
wasn't really paying
too much attention
back when, you know...

37
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:42,632
But I have taken
other measures. Lady
Tsunade, please give
the order...

38
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:44,335
Right.

39
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:47,609
Stop right there,
Naruto!

40
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,052
Why are there so
many guards?!

41
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:55,525
<i>I knew something</i>
<i>was up!</i>

42
00:04:55,558 --> 00:04:59,599
Look, Naruto, I'm
sorry but I cannot
let you get by.

43
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,572
Please cooperate
and go back to
that room.

44
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:06,012
I don't understand
what's going on.
Why is Shino's dad
here?

45
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:08,316
And why are all you
guys watching me?!

46
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,890
Enough just go
inside. We'll
talk there.

47
00:05:11,924 --> 00:05:15,898
No, I won't. I don't
see why you can't
tell me out here.

48
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:21,777
Shibi, let me
talk to him.

49
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,213
(gasp)

50
00:05:23,246 --> 00:05:25,618
I-Iruka Sensei?!

51
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:31,630
Wait, hold on...
What are you doing
here on this island?!

52
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,970
(chuckle)

53
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:38,711
There's a second
mission to accomplish
here. And we were
sent over to provide

54
00:05:38,744 --> 00:05:43,119
some backup for you.
We've heard that
this place is quite
dangerous.

55
00:05:43,152 --> 00:05:46,192
Why can't I go
outside?!

56
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:51,937
It appears that there's
a new species of animal
living here. And our job
will be to identify it.

57
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,507
That's because-

58
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:58,249
You know, I wonder...
I sensed the Nine
Tails' chakra. Is that
related somehow?

59
00:05:58,283 --> 00:06:03,894
He could sense Kinkaku
and Ginkaku's chakra even
in here?! Where all chakra
is blocked out?

60
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:08,203
We cannot let him
go outside. It would
be too dangerous!

61
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:12,745
Do your best to
convince him, Iruka.

62
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:15,217
Oh, uh...
Maybe!

63
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,691
The creature does
appear to possess
the Nine Tails'
chakra. I guess

64
00:06:18,724 --> 00:06:22,932
there are others like
the Nine Tails here,
although this creature
isn't a Tailed Beast.

65
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:27,207
If you go outside and
the creature somehow
responds to the Nine
Tails chakra you

66
00:06:27,241 --> 00:06:28,777
possess, it's
over for you.

67
00:06:28,811 --> 00:06:33,052
That's why we
want you to stay
inside and keep
hidden.

68
00:06:33,086 --> 00:06:36,492
Is this creature the
reason why Captain
Yamato hasn't come
back yet?

69
00:06:36,526 --> 00:06:41,703
That's right. Wood
Style works best to
suppress the Nine Tails'
chakra, of course.

70
00:06:41,737 --> 00:06:43,273
You know that all
too well.

71
00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:48,016
Come on, let's
go back inside,
all right?

72
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:54,328
Master Bee stands atop
the island's hierarchy
of beasts. He's tamed
every one of them.

73
00:06:54,361 --> 00:07:01,008
<i>Huh... That feeling</i>
<i>I had when I did</i>
<i>that fist bump with</i>
<i>Master Bee...</i>

74
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:03,413
<i>That was for real!</i>

75
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,456
I can stop any
creatures that try
to mess with me.

76
00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:11,162
Let me out so
I can see what's
going on!

77
00:07:19,512 --> 00:07:21,115
We can't let
Naruto escape.

78
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:22,451
On it!

79
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:50,808
Okay! I've got him
with Shadow Possession!

80
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:52,477
(gasp)

81
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,461
What's happening?!
What was that?!

82
00:08:17,494 --> 00:08:20,433
He sensed everything
in Sage Mode.

83
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:23,373
What's going on?!
Why is all this
happening?!

84
00:08:23,406 --> 00:08:25,310
War's being waged.

85
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,782
Madara has
declared war.

86
00:08:28,617 --> 00:08:30,220
No, Iruka!
Don't do this!

87
00:08:30,253 --> 00:08:35,196
Look, Shibi, I've
had enough. The
lying stops right
now. I know Naruto

88
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,469
can handle it.
He needs to know
the whole truth,
and then he can

89
00:08:38,504 --> 00:08:40,340
make a more
informed decision.

90
00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:43,914
But why have you been
hiding all of this
from me?! My comrades
are out there fighting

91
00:08:43,947 --> 00:08:46,218
and going through
all kinds of hell
without me!

92
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:52,632
Because part of this
war is to make sure
you remain protected
from Madara.

93
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:58,777
<i>Madara has launched</i>
<i>an all-out assault.</i>
<i>His goal is to capture</i>
<i>you and Lord Killer Bee,</i>

94
00:08:58,811 --> 00:09:02,484
and extract the
Eight and Nine Tails
from inside you.

95
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:07,327
If he can extract
both Tailed Beasts,
then he'll complete
his jutsu. And the

96
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,674
entire world will end.
So by protecting you,
we'll be protecting the
future and everybody

97
00:09:13,707 --> 00:09:14,843
around the world.

98
00:09:16,212 --> 00:09:18,817
We're all putting
our lives on the
line, fighting to
keep you safe.

99
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:22,290
Naruto, your fight
will be with yourself.

100
00:09:22,324 --> 00:09:27,067
Because you'll
have to stay here.

101
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,710
There will never be
such a thing as
true peace! Not as
long as we're forced

102
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:33,647
to live in this
accursed world!

103
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,887
<i>Peace is impossible!</i>
<i>Impossible!</i>

104
00:09:38,322 --> 00:09:40,026
Well, then...

105
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:44,502
I'm gonna break that
curse one day. If
there's truly such
a thing as peace in

106
00:09:44,536 --> 00:09:47,842
this world. Then
somehow, I'll find
it.

107
00:09:48,777 --> 00:09:51,282
And I'll never
give up!

108
00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:56,560
That's why no matter
how much pain my
own path brings,
I'll keep walking.

109
00:09:56,593 --> 00:10:00,033
Because that's
who Naruto is!

110
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:05,210
War inflicts death,
injury, and pain
on everyone. The
truth is, the more

111
00:10:05,243 --> 00:10:07,949
precious someone
is to us...

112
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:12,592
The harder it is
for us to accept
that they might die.
You might try to

113
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:17,902
find meaning in war,
but all there is, is
loss and unbearable
pain.

114
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:24,949
All that senseless
death, it unleashes a
cycle of violence and
hatred that never ends.

115
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:28,624
War creates
only more war.

116
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:35,069
And those are the
things you will face
in the coming days,
Naruto.

117
00:10:36,205 --> 00:10:39,946
It seems that this
is finally going to
be it for me...

118
00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:45,925
Naruto, I think you
of all people can
bring peace.

119
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:51,703
Nagato, what you
said to me, is this
what you meant?

120
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:56,111
Now, let's
go back.

121
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:04,094
I can stop this.
I know that I can.
You have to let me!

122
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:09,137
I'll take it all
on myself, all the
hatred and all the
pain.

123
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:11,643
Because that's
my role.

124
00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:15,951
Haven't you been
listening to me at
all?! You have the
Nine Tails inside

125
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:18,724
you! This isn't just
about you, Naruto!

126
00:11:18,757 --> 00:11:23,266
You know, you were
the very first person
to acknowledge me,
Iruka Sensei...

127
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:27,307
Why are you worried
about the Nine Tails
now? Why can't you
trust me and have

128
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,610
faith in me!

129
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:31,448
Don't act like a
spoiled brat! Do
you know what you
are to me?!

130
00:11:32,217 --> 00:11:33,654
(laughing)

131
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:37,562
Why are you protecting
that freak? He's the
one that wiped out
your family.

132
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:42,103
He wants the scroll
for his own power and
his own vengeance!

133
00:11:42,137 --> 00:11:45,109
I mean that is
how beasts are,
after all...

134
00:11:45,143 --> 00:11:45,844
You're right...

135
00:11:45,878 --> 00:11:47,848
That is how
beasts are!

136
00:11:51,322 --> 00:11:56,800
However, that's not
who Naruto is, not
at all!

137
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:01,442
<i>Naruto's one of a</i>
<i>kind. Works hard,</i>
<i>puts his whole</i>
<i>heart into it.</i>

138
00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:06,385
Sure, he messes up.
And gets jumped on.

139
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:12,932
But his suffering only
makes him stronger.
That's what separates
him from being a beast.

140
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:16,806
So you're wrong,
he's nothing like the
Nine-Tailed Fox.

141
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:24,021
He is a ninja of the
Hidden Leaf Village.
And his name is,
Naruto Uzumaki!

142
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,011
You see, to
me, you...

143
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:39,886
You remain one of
my most important
students. Also...

144
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,192
I think of you as
my little brother.

145
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,674
<i>The enemy leader is</i>
<i>targeting you with</i>
<i>everything he's got.</i>

146
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:55,183
<i>How can I stand</i>
<i>here and let that</i>
<i>happen? Let you</i>
<i>face such danger?</i>

147
00:12:55,216 --> 00:12:59,257
And besides,
there's no reason
for you to shoulder
that burden alone.

148
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,197
Look, I'm not just
some little kid
anymore!

149
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,600
I'm strong now!

150
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:08,209
Remember, Sensei,
you are the one who
gave me that headband.

151
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:23,406
Hey, Iruka.

152
00:14:09,364 --> 00:14:10,601
I can't!

153
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,278
I'm sorry, but I
just can't let you
leave this place.

154
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:26,599
Sensei, didn't I
tell you that I'm
stronger now?

155
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,469
You can't keep
me here!

156
00:14:31,943 --> 00:14:32,712
He broke free!

157
00:14:32,745 --> 00:14:33,980
I'll stop him!

158
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:46,238
My Parasitic Insects
can't handle the
Nine Tails' chakra!

159
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:52,417
Temui! I want you to
contact the Barrier
Corps, now. Tell them
that Naruto is coming!

160
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,452
Right!

161
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:56,325
And the rest of
you come with me!
Let's go!

162
00:14:58,162 --> 00:15:01,468
<i>Why?! Why,</i>
<i>Iruka Sensei?!</i>

163
00:15:13,593 --> 00:15:14,294
Huh?!

164
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,438
What is this?!

165
00:15:21,609 --> 00:15:26,953
Knowing you. I'm sure
that you're going to
rush right to the
battlefield.

166
00:15:26,986 --> 00:15:31,830
I also know how
determined you are.
The fact that you're
reading this means

167
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:33,900
that I wasn't
able to stop you.

168
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:37,741
Ever since Lady
Tsunade tasked me
with going to the
Cloud's secret

169
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:42,283
hidden island in
order to keep you
there, I've had
this on hand.

170
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:46,559
I've kept this
letter ready just
in case I failed.

171
00:15:46,593 --> 00:15:51,703
I'm disappointed in
myself for failing.
I don't know if I'll
ever be able to give

172
00:15:51,736 --> 00:15:57,413
you this note, but
still, there's
something that you
need to hear from me.

173
00:15:59,952 --> 00:16:04,996
You've gone off, so
this is the only
thing that I have left
to say.

174
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:11,008
No matter what
happens, come
back alive!

175
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:19,559
Forgive me,
Naruto. I'm
weak.

176
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:25,403
I think of myself
as your big brother,
but I've never been
able to protect you.

177
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,215
So the little guy's
already gone, huh?
Fool, that fool.

178
00:16:34,655 --> 00:16:40,299
Killer Bee? That's
who you are, right? I
need to ask something
of you right now.

179
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:47,013
Hm? Wait, who is
this guy? I've
seen him somewhere
before, haven't I?

180
00:16:47,046 --> 00:16:49,685
Please, I beg
you to keep
Naruto safe!

181
00:16:54,027 --> 00:16:58,503
Hold on, that's not
the way to appeal,
you see. What you
should do is raise

182
00:16:58,537 --> 00:16:59,271
your fist with me.

183
00:16:59,304 --> 00:17:03,613
Oh, uh...
Is it like this?

184
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:11,128
Now you got me
for real! Fool,
ya fool!

185
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,405
Oh wait, I get
it. It's you...

186
00:17:17,373 --> 00:17:18,710
Huh?

187
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:25,022
Can you really keep
this promise, Bee?
Naruto did get out on
your watch, after all.

188
00:17:25,056 --> 00:17:32,237
Hey, if he couldn't
stop the little fool's
plan. Then frankly,
no one can.

189
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:38,349
<i>You're part of Naruto's</i>
<i>private clan. You're</i>
<i>always in his heart.</i>
<i>And in his mind.</i>

190
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:43,259
What? Me?
I am?

191
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:48,369
Naruto need you.
Now, don't be stunned.
To him, it's no doubt
that you're number one.

192
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:54,147
So whatever you've
done, to Naruto you
shine like the sun and
you're just as golden.

193
00:17:54,180 --> 00:18:00,293
Naruto listens to all
you say, and he's kept
it securely inside
him to this day.

194
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:04,735
What's protected
Naruto all this
time, were your
words to him.

195
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:17,728
You're really going
to chase Naruto
outside the barrier?

196
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:21,636
Yeah, of course
I am! I'm still
training him,
fool ya fool!

197
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:25,142
You'll be getting
the Iron Claw from
the Raikage for sure.

198
00:18:25,176 --> 00:18:29,284
Look, a real battle
always teaches you
more than merely
training, anyway!

199
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:32,190
It's a shortcut to
power up, ya fool!

200
00:18:32,223 --> 00:18:37,266
What is the meaning
of this, Tsunade?!
The Nine Tails already
got past our men?!

201
00:18:37,668 --> 00:18:40,072
<i>Iruka...</i>

202
00:18:40,106 --> 00:18:42,978
We'll just have to
use brute force
to stop him.

203
00:18:43,012 --> 00:18:44,749
<i>Is the Barrier</i>
<i>Corps ready?</i>

204
00:18:44,782 --> 00:18:48,590
There's a thirty-
six-layer self-
regenerating barrier
around the island.

205
00:18:48,623 --> 00:18:53,566
Even a Jinchuriki
couldn't get through
that. So please, rest
assured.

206
00:18:55,403 --> 00:18:57,675
It's Naruto!
He's coming!

207
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:01,683
Good! The Barrier
Corps will show
everyone what
were made of!

208
00:19:01,716 --> 00:19:06,091
The time has come!
Our blood, sweat,
and tears will now
reveal just what

209
00:19:06,124 --> 00:19:08,697
we can do with
this impenetrable
barrier!

210
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,801
We will not
let him pass!

211
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:15,544
The only message
Headquarter will
receive from us is,
"Mission Accomplished."

212
00:19:15,577 --> 00:19:17,380
Do you understand!

213
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:20,353
Huh?

214
00:19:20,554 --> 00:19:21,488
Ahh!

215
00:19:26,264 --> 00:19:27,534
What is this?!

216
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,976
There's a barrier
beyond that. And
you and I are gonna
break it, stat!

217
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,813
All right,
Octopops!

218
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,668
I'll break the
barrier, ya fool!
And then Naruto,
you get the Tailed

219
00:19:44,702 --> 00:19:46,572
Beast Bomb in,
ya fool!

220
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:47,508
Right!

221
00:19:51,281 --> 00:19:53,686
Killer Bee the
Eight Tails is
here, as well!

222
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,522
What's that?!
No!

223
00:19:54,555 --> 00:19:58,963
All right!
Now here we go!
Ya fool!

224
00:20:01,168 --> 00:20:03,606
(powerful yell)

225
00:20:06,111 --> 00:20:07,313
It's no good!

226
00:20:07,346 --> 00:20:09,618
The barrier can't
regenerate quickly
enough!

227
00:20:09,652 --> 00:20:12,758
Ooh, that means
that at this
rate...

228
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:17,935
Well, Chief. What
exactly do you want
me to relay to
Headquarters, then?

229
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:22,410
That our mission
failed!

230
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:25,650
Yeah, I kinda
figured that.

231
00:20:43,753 --> 00:20:45,657
(powerful yell)

232
00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:05,229
Damn it!

233
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:06,833
They're out!

234
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,235
(exhausted moans)

235
00:21:11,241 --> 00:21:16,351
But there were
two of them. Two
jinchuriki! No one
told us to expect

236
00:21:16,384 --> 00:21:18,823
that! W-what
could I do?!

237
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:23,432
(weary sigh)

238
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:03,600
Incredible chakra!
An immense chakra
field has appeared
on the battlefield

239
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:07,039
near Darui's First
company! What is it?

240
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:12,116
<i>It's some sort of</i>
<i>humanoid monster!</i>
<i>It's ravaging our</i>
<i>troops! And it</i>

241
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:13,886
<i>appears to be</i>
<i>controlled by...</i>

242
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,122
Who is it?!

243
00:23:15,155 --> 00:23:17,426
<i>We believe it's</i>
<i>Madara Uchiha!</i>

244
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,336
<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: Attack</i>
<i>of the Gedo Statue.</i>

245
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,808
Gedo Statue!
Go!
