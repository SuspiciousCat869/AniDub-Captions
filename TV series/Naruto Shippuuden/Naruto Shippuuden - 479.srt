94
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:50,007
{\an1}So to get it back, all intact,
you gotta act! Use Hashirama's
cells, in fact!

00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,308

shinobi... is second to none.

152

{\an1}However, if your goal is to
become Hokage...

153
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:14,542
{\an1}...you must learn how to stand
above others and how to lead
them effectively.

154
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:15,776
Heh

155
00:14:16,311 --> 00:14:19,212
{\an1}You catch on to things fast, and
most of the time,

156
00:14:19,245 --> 00:14:23,281
{\an1}Shikamaru will be able to
support you with his
resourcefulness.

157
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:27,283
{\an1}However, at the same time, a
minimum of learning and
knowledge is essential.

158
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:31,385
{\an1}We're rivals, and both of us
aim to become Hokage, right?!

159
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:34,253
Heh!

160
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:39,756
Yeah!

161
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:47,893
(Steam Kettel)

162
00:14:47,927 --> 00:14:51,695
{\an1}Wow, you really dug in, Naruto!
And in just two more years,

163
00:14:51,728 --> 00:14:53,296
{\an1}you'll be able to become a
jonin.

164
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:55,397
{\an1}Too loooong! Ugh!

165
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:59,899
{\an1}Well, what do you say for now,
we call it a day and go grab
some ramen?

166
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,267
Yea!

167
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:08,370
{\an1}Now the real question is what
toppings should I choose... and
how many?

168
00:15:08,404 --> 00:15:10,737
{\an1}Heheheh Hey, don't get
carried away, all right?

169
00:15:11,738 --> 00:15:12,738
Huh?

170
00:15:22,777 --> 00:15:25,246
{\an1}It's all thanks to you, Iruka
Sensei.

171
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:26,545
What is?

172
00:15:27,613 --> 00:15:30,081
{\an1}Do you remember way back then?

173
00:15:30,614 --> 00:15:31,416
Huh?

174
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:33,216
{\an1}Well that night...

175
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,351
{\an1}You acknowledged me.
Do you remember?

176
00:15:37,285 --> 00:15:38,918
{\an1}It was the first time ever!

177
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:42,586
{\an1}And that's the reason why
I'm here today.

178
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:47,424
{\an1}If no one had acknowledged me,
and I stayed the way I was...

179
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:52,092
{\an1}...maybe I would've resented
the village and everyone in it
and gone wild.

180
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:58,528
{\an1}But, then... the words that
you spoke that night... They
completely changed me.

181
00:15:59,595 --> 00:16:03,898
{\an1}But that's NOT who Naruto is
... He's nothing like that!

182
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:08,934
{\an1}He's one of a kind, and he works
hard. He puts his whole heart
into it.

183
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:13,270
{\an1}He is a ninja of the Village
Hidden in the Leaves.

184
00:16:13,936 --> 00:16:17,339
{\an1}And his name... is Naruto
Uzumaki!

185
00:16:17,638 --> 00:16:18,604
{\an1}Thank you for that,...

186
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:21,107
...Iruka Sensei.

187
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:24,574
(Sniffling)

188
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:31,112
{\an1}(sniffle) Okay that does it!
Just today, you can have all
the toppings that you want!

189
00:16:31,478 --> 00:16:33,980
{\an1}Yeah, all right! Awesome!

190
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:36,513
(Door Unlocking)

191
00:16:36,548 --> 00:16:37,415
Huh?

192
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:45,219
(Footsteps)

193
00:16:45,252 --> 00:16:46,219
Sasuke...

194
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:03,661
{\an1}Well, to be perfectly honest,
under normal circumstances,

195
00:17:03,694 --> 00:17:06,062
{\an1}someone like you would be
imprisoned.

196
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:09,697
{\an1}That your past actions were
pardoned and that your wish
has now been granted...

197
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:15,234
{\an1}...speaks to the enormity of
your help... in undoing the
Infinite Tsukuyomi.

198
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:18,403
{\an1}But also, my becoming the Sixth
Hokage...

199
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,770
{\an1}...and that Naruto,

200
00:17:20,803 --> 00:17:27,340
{\an1}the key figure in ending the
war, testified on your behalf
helped. Don't forget that.

201
00:17:27,374 --> 00:17:30,575
{\an1}Try not to cause too much
trouble from here on out.

202
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:32,509
{\an1}Otherwise I'll be held
accountable.

203
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:34,510
{\an1}Yeah... Sorry about that.

204
00:17:35,543 --> 00:17:37,379
{\an1}Do you really have to go?

205
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:40,847
{\an1}The artificial arm Lady
Tsunade made

206
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,281
{\an1}from Lord Hashirama's
cells is almost done.

207
00:17:43,315 --> 00:17:46,150
{\an1}I need a little time to work
out my feelings...

208
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:50,285
{\an1}I want to know how the shinobi
world looks to the current me.

209
00:17:51,052 --> 00:17:54,954
{\an1}I feel like I'll be able to
see things I've overlooked.

210
00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:57,789
{\an1}Things I can only perceive in my
current state.

211
00:17:57,822 --> 00:18:01,157
{\an1}Also, something's been
weighing on me.

212
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,025
Uhh!?!

213
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:07,727
{\an1}And what if I said...

214
00:18:07,761 --> 00:18:09,962
{\an1}That I wanted to come with
you?

215
00:18:16,232 --> 00:18:21,834
{\an1}This is a trip to atone for my
sins. And my sins have nothing
to do with you.

216
00:18:24,568 --> 00:18:28,171
{\an1}Nothing to do with... huh...

217
00:18:29,605 --> 00:18:30,372
Oh!?!

218
00:18:33,106 --> 00:18:34,707
Maybe next time.

219
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,575
{\an1}Thank you, Sakura.

220
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:07,857
{\an1}I didn't think that you'd be
coming to see me off.

221
00:19:10,658 --> 00:19:11,393
Hmm...

222
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:17,029
{\an1}You still had this thing?

223
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,366
{\an1}You stopped me, as a
friend... even at the cost of
your hand.

224
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,700
{\an1}And I was saved thanks to you.

225
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:33,171
{\an1}We were insignificant little
things who used to clash,

226
00:19:33,204 --> 00:19:35,372
{\an1}and now we're able to share
each other's pain.

227
00:19:35,405 --> 00:19:40,207
{\an1}And after journeying long and
seeing the world, I've realized
something...

228
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:43,509
{\an1}This isn't just about
you and me.

229
00:19:43,543 --> 00:19:48,511
{\an1}I believe this concept can be
applied to even bigger things
than just us.

230
00:19:48,545 --> 00:19:53,081
{\an1}But it's not something that can
be done as easily as you were
able to.

231
00:19:53,114 --> 00:19:55,515
{\an1}I never assumed it
would be simple.

232
00:19:55,549 --> 00:20:00,184
{\an1}Just like it wasn't with the two
of us. Especially with something
so big.

233
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:04,753
{\an1}I'm giving this back.

234
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,254
{\an1}Yeah, all right, sure. I'll
hang on to it...

235
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:13,124
{\an1}till we have our real fight.

236
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:20,194
{\an1}It's kind of like a prayer. To
keep enduring until it comes to
be, no matter what.

237
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:23,196
{\an1}And to those whom that task
falls on...

238
00:20:24,062 --> 00:20:25,696
{\an1}...perhaps that's what it
means...

239
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:28,532
{\an1}...to be a ninja.

240
00:22:13,184 --> 00:22:17,653
{\an1}Once upon a time, there lived a
fox spirit with nine tails.

241
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,888
{\an1}It was sealed inside a shinobi
child,

242
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:26,491
who, over time,
befriended and came to
collaborate with the fox.

243
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:30,826
{\an1}Then befell a new calamity, the
reviving of Ten Tails.

244
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,761
{\an1}But the shinobi child matured
into a shinobi youth,

245
00:22:34,794 --> 00:22:38,631
{\an1}became one with the fox spirit
and the shinobi clans,

246
00:22:38,663 --> 00:22:41,166
{\an1}and sealed Ten Tails away.

247
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:45,234
{\an1}This shinobi youth was the son
of the Fourth Hokage

248
00:22:45,268 --> 00:22:48,002
{\an1}and was himself called the
Seventh Hokage...

249
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:52,971
{\an1}"Naruto Uzumaki!!"

250
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:02,309
{\an1}Ooh! This looks really tasty!

251
00:23:02,675 --> 00:23:06,645
{\an1}Yeah, well, I was the one who
caught it, so of course it's
gonna taste really good!

252
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,979
{\an1}I will make you strong!

253
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,981
{\an1}If you're in danger, I'll give
my life to protect you!

254
00:23:14,849 --> 00:23:16,149
Brother Neji!

255
00:23:17,683 --> 00:23:21,486
{\an1}Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Naruto and Hinata."
