1
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:09,343
-You're telling me you want to
master a new jutsu right now?

2
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,844
It just can't be done.

3
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:11,929
It's impossible.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,138
-I don't care if it is.

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,099
I don't have any other choice.

6
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,351
-Right.

7
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,686
This'll be a bit on the
harsh side, but we'll try it.

8
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:20,479
-You mean it?

9
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,314
You have some kinda idea?

10
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,190
GAMAKICHI: You.

11
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:25,150
Hop into Gamatatsu's mouth.

12
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:25,984
-Uh--

13
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:29,655
-Well, then, what do we do?

14
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,950
Thanks to the bats, the enemy
already knows our location.

15
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,327
They could take action
against us at any moment.

16
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,828
-The enemy will
either pull back,

17
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,830
knowing that a confrontation
with the four of us

18
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,042
would waste a lot of time,
or they'll hit us hard.

19
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,753
-In any case, our mission
is to capture the bad guys

20
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,714
and extract information out
of them, no matter what.

21
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,217
If we lose track of
the enemy, something

22
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,719
tells me they're going to become
a big problem for the Hidden

23
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,180
Leaf Village.

24
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,848
HINATA: We have
to keep searching.

25
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,934
-Right.

26
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,811
-Now, listen up, people.

27
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:04,273
Lord Orochimaru has given
us a very important mission.

28
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:08,443
We have to deliver this boy
to a specific lake safely.

29
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:12,155
Mistakes will not be tolerated.

30
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,367
However, a group of
strangers have followed us

31
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,785
from the hideout.

32
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,204
-That's pretty
perceptive of you, Guren.

33
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,998
Just what I'd expect from you.

34
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,750
The enemy has four ninja
and one ninja hound.

35
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,712
Right now, three of them and the
dog are a couple of kilometers

36
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:27,796
away from our position.

37
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:31,425
-What do we do?

38
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,051
-I know just the thing.

39
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,888
And when I'm through, they
won't be following us anymore.

40
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:40,559
Bring them to me, and
I will crush them.

41
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:48,233
[theme music]

42
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,425
-Right!

43
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,802
OK, guys, I think
I can do it now.

44
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,554
-That's the spirit, Naruto.

45
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,180
-All right, Gamatatsu.

46
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,849
Let me in there one more time.

47
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,984
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): OK.

48
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,862
Feel it, now.

49
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,821
Gamatatsu's chakra.

50
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:17,716
I can feel how he builds it
up, before he spits it out.

51
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,596
[scream]

52
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,017
-Sorry.

53
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,227
-Oh, no!

54
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,479
Naruto!

55
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,730
Naruto!

56
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,273
Are you OK?

57
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,149
Talk to me.

58
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:34,733
-Yeah.

59
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,401
Yeah, I'm fine.

60
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:40,322
And I think I just finally
figured something out.

61
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,199
-Did you, now?

62
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,575
GAMAKICHI (VOICEOVER):
Well, well.

63
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,910
Things are getting interesting.

64
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,247
-OK, don't stop now.

65
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,794
Let's keep working on it,
while it's fresh in my mind.

66
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,253
SAKURA: Naruto!

67
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:55,754
-Huh?

68
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:56,713
-Hm?

69
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:57,214
-Huh?

70
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,302
Uh, hi, Sakura.

71
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,094
-Come on.

72
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,721
Enough wasting time here.

73
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,097
We've got stuff to do.

74
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,686
Whoa, you smell terrible.

75
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,438
What happened to you?

76
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,107
And how come you're all slimy?

77
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,026
-Actually, believe
it or not, we've

78
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,028
been working on something
really important.

79
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,446
-Yeah, yeah, tell me later.

80
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,739
Everybody's waiting for you.

81
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,281
Let's go!

82
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:23,990
-Hey!

83
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,033
Hey, Sakura, come on.

84
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,660
I'm in the middle of training.

85
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,994
-I'll give you training.

86
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:28,995
-Sorry, Gamakichi.

87
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,080
Sorry, guys.

88
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,665
I guess I gotta go
now, but I'll call you!

89
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,958
Don't worry!

90
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,085
-All right, but keep training.

91
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,255
-Hey, big brother, do
you have any mouthwash?

92
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,308
-I can see it.

93
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,352
And it looks like the
chakra of shinobi!

94
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,149
Watch out!

95
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,152
-So, you must be
their leader, huh?

96
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:01,820
-Kakashi-sensei!

97
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,453
-Sensei!

98
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:10,996
-No!

99
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,290
Kiba, don't!

100
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,666
-What?

101
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,667
-Huh.

102
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,918
I missed.

103
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,837
Oh well, what can you do?

104
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,881
Now that Gozu's got their
leader out of the way,

105
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,593
the rest of them shouldn't
be too difficult.

106
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:28,179
Since you found us, you must
have great tracking skills.

107
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,015
You're gonna wish you
didn't by the time

108
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,643
we're finished with you.

109
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:37,272
-Are they-- are they the ones--

110
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,106
-Yeah.

111
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,190
Must be.

112
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,859
They've gotta be the
ones in that hideout.

113
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,359
No question.

114
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,032
Better watch your step, Hinata.

115
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:47,949
-Right.

116
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,326
Taking on three of them.

117
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,245
What's our strategy?

118
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,164
-Akamaru's jutsu
and mine are linked.

119
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,541
If we can take out one of
them, reduce their numbers,

120
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,753
that ought to improve the odds.

121
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,713
-And after that?

122
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,174
-I'd like to say we wipe
the floor with them,

123
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,884
but I guess the
safest plan is just

124
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,345
to hold them long enough for
Kakashi-sensei to get back

125
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,722
here and help us out.

126
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,475
-Got it.

127
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,727
-We should target one
of the two in front.

128
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,104
This masked guy's
hiding something.

129
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,899
I wanted to know what it
is before I took him on.

130
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:25,737
Which leaves-- now, Akamaru!

00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,094

136
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,389
-Cool.

137
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,016
Thanks, Akamaru.

138
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,435
KIBA (VOICEOVER): If it's
not poison, what is it, then?

139
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,395
Some kind of diversion?

140
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:03,858
What?

141
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,735
Hold on.

142
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,196
I'm not getting
their scent anymore.

143
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,616
I can't smell
anything at all now.

144
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,742
I get it.

145
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,494
This fog's more
than a diversion.

146
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,246
They're using it to
cover their movements.

147
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,299
This is bad.

148
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,467
I can't see 'em.

149
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,552
I can't smell 'em.

150
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,140
Hey, wait a second.

151
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,309
What's true for me must
be true for them, too.

152
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,812
So how come these guys
know exactly where I am?

153
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,066
-Nurari, go on.

154
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:54,451
-Uh-oh.

155
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,829
They're coming.

156
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:58,329
-Duck!

157
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:04,210
-Hinata?

158
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,593
-Fal back, Kiba.

159
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,094
I'll handle this.

160
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,350
-Be careful, Hinata.

161
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,352
I don't know why
it is, but this fog

162
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,021
doesn't seem to affect
their movements,

163
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,981
or their ability to see us.

164
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:28,193
-Well, they can take away
my sight and sense of smell,

165
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,986
but I've still got my Byakugan.

166
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,243
-OK.

167
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:37,952
Come on, Akamaru!

168
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,880
-You're facing me now.

169
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:49,881
Just try it!

170
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,105
-How can you-- impossible!

171
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:05,814
You can't!

172
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,232
Not in this smokescreen.

173
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,233
-Oh, yes.

174
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,443
I can see every attack
you throw at me.

175
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:15,824
Right here!

176
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,121
[scream]

177
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,290
-Just kidding.

178
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:31,756
-What?

179
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:32,757
Did I miss?

180
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,144
It's not possible.

181
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:44,644
How?

182
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,700
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): His
strength is incredible.

183
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,117
-Huh?

184
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,961
Now die!

185
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:10,962
Ha ha ha!

186
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,018
A shadow clone.

187
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,853
-That's right.

188
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:30,315
I'd be crazy to take on someone
as strong as you in a stand up

189
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,900
fight.

190
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,695
Your muscles have been
enhanced beyond their limits.

191
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,572
Did Orochimaru do that for you?

192
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,243
Run around all you want.

193
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,078
You can't beat me.

194
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,165
Your assets are your speed
and incredible strength,

195
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,168
but I can anticipate
your every move.

196
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,629
That's my asset.

197
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,589
It's pointless to keep this up.

198
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,590
Just come along quietly.

199
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,344
-I think not.

200
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,400
-So, it's begun.

201
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,278
It's a good way to test the
strength of friends and foes

202
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,947
alike.

203
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,700
Meanwhile, I have my own
business to take care of.

204
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,172
-Such a shame.

205
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:40,593
Even though you can see
me, you're still helpless.

206
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,220
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
There's something--

207
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,848
some force surrounding his body.

208
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,475
That's why he's not affected.

209
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,478
No matter how much
chakra I hit him with.

210
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,896
[laughter]

211
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,983
-You use the Gentle Fist, I see.

212
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:59,696
That jutsu is
useless against me.

213
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,073
You sure you don't
want that smiling boy

214
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,533
to come back and help you?

215
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,245
HINATA (VOICEOVER): No.

216
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,080
I won't call Kiba back.

217
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,540
That would be just
what he wants.

218
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,763
[scream]

219
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,264
-Hinata!

220
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,104
[scream]

221
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:33,604
-Hinata!

222
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,366
Damn.

223
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,869
There's gotta be
something I can do.

224
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,786
[whine]

225
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:49,287
-Huh?

226
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,884
That might work.

227
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:03,551
Yeah.

228
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,720
It just might work.

229
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:06,971
Come on, Akamaru.

230
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:07,930
[bark]

231
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:21,903
GOZU: Over here!

232
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,835
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): He's
even faster than before.

233
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,721
But his attacks are
unsophisticated.

234
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:49,722
They're easy to read.

235
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:55,520
What?

236
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,066
Do I have time?

237
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,795
-Go on, Nurari.

238
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,588
Finish her.

239
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,548
-With pleasure.

240
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:36,436
[crashing]

241
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,437
-What?

242
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,146
What is this?

243
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,360
KIBA: One more time.

244
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,194
Fang Over Fang!

245
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,531
I

246
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,031
-Kiba!

247
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,302
-What's going on?

248
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,429
-Hinata!

249
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,263
[bark]

250
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,306
-Hi.

251
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,140
Sorry we're late.

252
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,269
What is it?

253
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,979
Are you all right?

254
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,439
-How-- Kiba?

255
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,316
How did you ever--

256
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:23,941
-Heh.

257
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,276
It was easy.

258
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:28,237
I just used my Fang Over Fang
to stir things up a little.

259
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,115
I made a mini windstorm
and got the air moving.

260
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:35,703
Next thing you know, goodbye
annoying smokescreen.

261
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:39,457
Now that I can see and smell
again, we've got the advantage.

262
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,918
No more fun and
games for you, buddy.

263
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,213
Get ready, 'cause
you're going down.

264
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,131
-You're the ones who
should get ready.

265
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,640
[coughing]

266
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,641
-Idiot.

267
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,976
How could I have
forgotten the other guy?

268
00:16:58,976 --> 00:16:59,936
-Yeah, that was stupid.

269
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:15,243
Well then, now that we know all
their strengths and weaknesses,

270
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,328
this time we finish them!

271
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:17,870
-Right!

272
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:27,171
-What the-- no, it can't be.

273
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,139
We're being surrounded.

274
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,100
I can sense it.

275
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,893
-Renji, what is it?

276
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:41,519
-Quick!

277
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,020
Another smokescreen!

278
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,605
Retreat, now!

279
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:51,112
-What the-- But why?

280
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,405
I don't get it.

281
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:56,576
SHIN: It would seem the
enemy's senses are very acute.

282
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,417
KIBA: Shino!

283
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,710
-It's very disappointing.

284
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:15,219
Just when I had almost finished
weaving my net around them.

285
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,558
-Heh.

286
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,560
-Is everyone all right?

287
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,437
-Kakashi-sensei.

288
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,689
-Well, at least
we're all together.

289
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:27,898
-Yeah.

290
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,859
But Hinata--

291
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,027
-How bad is it?

292
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,237
Can you move?

293
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,530
-I'm fine.

294
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,408

00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,455
-Sensei, did you wrap things
up with the big fella?

297
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,375
KAKASHI: No.

298
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,794
I couldn't finish the job.

299
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,546
KIBA: I see.

300
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,131
Ours got away from us, too.

301
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,638
-Then this battle's
far from over.

302
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,766
And whoever it is
who's using that jutsu,

303
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,518
they're still out there.

GUREN: Well, how interesting.

305
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:11,025
I never expected to be pursued
by Kakashi, the famous copy

307
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,779
Poor Renji and Gozu.

308
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,449
They never had a chance.

309
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,701
So far so good.

310
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,328
All the groundwork's been laid.

311
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,746
Now it's my turn.

312
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:21,929
-Mother.

NARUTO: Captain
Yamato, shouldn't we

315
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,156
be getting close to
Kakashi-sensei's squad by now?

316
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,074
YAMATO: Yes.

317
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,158
According to
procedure, he should

318
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,660
have left signs
for us to follow.

319
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,286
SAI: Has anyone seen any?

320
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:09,995
I haven't.

321
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,288
NARUTO: Great.

322
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,998
Did he forget that we're
supposed to be following him?

323
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,124
SAKURA: Don't be an idiot.

324
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,501
He didn't forget.

325
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,003
We have to assume that something
happened to him and his team.

326
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,213
NARUTO: What?

327
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,340
YAMATO: Sai, get airborne
and take a look around.

328
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:24,134
I'm getting a bad
feeling about this.
