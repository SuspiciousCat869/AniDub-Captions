1
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:28,843
{\an1}So..if that guy up
there is the real
Madara...

2
00:00:28,877 --> 00:00:33,014
{\an1}That means the guy who
we thought was Madara...
isn't actually him?

3
00:00:33,047 --> 00:00:35,351
{\an1}Yes, so it seems.

4
00:00:35,384 --> 00:00:37,019
{\an1}You used to utilize
the Akatsuki.

5
00:00:37,052 --> 00:00:41,691
{\an7}So can't you speculate
on what the identity of
that masked man might
be, Tsuchikage?

6
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:44,495
There's no one
I can think of
right now.

7
00:00:44,529 --> 00:00:46,898
But honestly, it
doesn't really
matter who he is.

8
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,467
Whatever his name,
we still need to
stop him!

9
00:00:50,702 --> 00:00:56,476
{\an4}Their headbands say
shinobi, but I see them
wearing clothing from each
of the five great nations.

10
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:59,412
{\an1}Is this some new
united army?

11
00:00:59,446 --> 00:01:03,684
{\an1}Well, it does appear
that we're at war.

12
00:01:03,717 --> 00:01:05,519
{\an1}So that's what
he's up to.

13
00:01:05,553 --> 00:01:08,490
{\an1}But I wonder what exactly
he's got in mind now.

14
00:01:08,523 --> 00:01:12,294
{\an4}It doesn't look as if
things are going the
way he originally
planned them.

15
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:15,765
{\an1}Or else why would he
revive me in this
strange way.

16
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:19,969
{\an1}Who is the caster
of the Reanimation
Jutsu?

17
00:01:20,002 --> 00:01:21,940
{\an1}I have no idea.

18
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,748
{\an7}My name is Kabuto.

19
00:01:29,782 --> 00:01:31,116
{\an1}I'm his collaborator.

20
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,922
{\an1}Speaking to me through
a Reanimation Link? What
a sneaky one you are.

21
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:38,860
{\an1}Your reanimation is
quite special.

22
00:01:38,893 --> 00:01:42,430
{\an1}You're now even
greater than during
your glory days.

23
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:44,700
{\an1}Is that so?

24
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:47,903
{\an7}You know what I was
like during my glory
days, do you?

25
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:51,774
{\an1}No. That's one of the
reasons I brought you
here now.

26
00:01:51,808 --> 00:01:55,579
{\an1}To show me your
legendary Uchiha power.

27
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:00,852
{\an1}Guess we can't take
him that easily.

28
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:08,794
{\an1}Very well then.

{\an1}Rasen Shuriken!

88

in the mask claim
to be Madara
specifically?

89
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,486
{\an1}Why him?

90
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:34,959
{\an7}Well, it is as if
a presence like
Madara's does already
exist in this realm.

91
00:10:34,992 --> 00:10:40,566
{\an4}So even if one is full
of deceit, if you can
convince the world then
it will quake in fear.

92
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,469
{\an1}Just the name
itself is power.

93
00:10:43,503 --> 00:10:46,072
{\an1}It made us throw
caution to the wind.

94
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:52,280
{\an7}It drew our attention
and then the lie fooled
all of us into embarking
on a war!

95
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:58,554
{\an1}We've been had. We were

{\an1}But-But that's...

99
00:11:08,064 --> 00:11:11,836
{\an1}How come that Madara
guy posseses Rinnegan
eyes?

100
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,551
{\an1}It appears that my
guess was correct.

101
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:26,954
{\an1}The natural progression
following the Sharingan
is the Rinnegan.

102
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:32,294
{\an1}I managed to awaken
the Rinnegan just a
little prior to my death.

00:11:32,327 --> 00:11:34,530
{\an1}You said Kabuto, right?

104
00:11:34,564 --> 00:11:37,466
{\an1}What exactly did you
do to this body?

105
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,636
{\an1}Like I mentioned
to you before...

106
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,040
{\an1}I made you even better
than at the peak of
your power.

{\an1}You bastard.

{\an1}You know the secrets

read the Uchiha Stone Tablet
but you still managed to
decipher it.

110
00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:00,794
{\an7}I'm just testing out a
hypothesis suggested by many
years of experiments that Lord
Orochimaru and I conducted.

111
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:06,000
{\an1}And now, you are proving
that hypothesis to be
true after all.

112
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:10,939
{\an1}You are able to achieve a piece
of that God's power. The power
of Sage of Sixth Paths.

113
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:13,742
{\an1}Thanks to the might
that I built into you.

{\an1}Who would've guessed that
Fence Sitter lad...He's
become quite a capable shinobi.

146
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:21,298
{\an1}Yes!

147
00:15:21,331 --> 00:15:22,566
{\an1}The old man did it!

148
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:27,070
{\an1}<i>[sighs and groans of relief]</i>

149
00:15:27,103 --> 00:15:29,407
{\an1}<i>[relieved sigh]</i>

150
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:43,022
{\an7}But now...Just what
are you going to do
about the second
one, Ohnoki?

151
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:49,997
{\an1}<i>[shocked gasp]</i>

152
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:54,270
{\an1}<i>[painful yell]</i>

153
00:16:02,513 --> 00:16:04,415
{\an1}What?!

154
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:07,987
{\an1}<i>[startled grunt]</i>

155
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:09,688
{\an1}What happened out there?!

156
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:11,557
{\an1}From our Relay
Intel Unit...

157
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:16,596
{\an4}A giant boulder big enough
to block out the sky's
been dropped on our Fourth
Company's battlefield.

158
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,332
{\an1}It's the source of
this tremor!

159
00:16:19,366 --> 00:16:23,671
{\an1}Any further reports
from the Fourth Company
since the attack?!

160
00:16:23,704 --> 00:16:27,876
{\an1}The sheer scale of it...
To kill so many enemies
all at once.

161
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,578
{\an1}<i>[overwhelmed reaction]</i>

162
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:35,886
{\an4}There's no mistake...It's
Madara's Jutsu or close to
it. Lady Tsunade, at this
rate...

163
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,688
{\an7}That's it! I'll go!

164
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:10,359
{\an1}What...What in the
world happened?!

165
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:35,023
{\an1}<i>[painful grunts]</i>

166
00:17:35,056 --> 00:17:39,961
{\an1}<i>[struggling efforts]</i>

167
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,304
{\an1}Bendy guy! Why'd
you bother saving
a clone like me?

168
00:17:48,337 --> 00:17:53,878
{\an4}I feel bad about the
others...But whether
you're a clone or not you're
still sorely needed here.

169
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:56,481
{\an1}...if we hope to win.

170
00:17:56,514 --> 00:17:58,684
{\an1}<i>[upset reaction]</i>

171
00:17:58,717 --> 00:17:59,652
{\an1}<i>[startled gasp]</i>

172
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:06,660
{\an1}What about Grampa
Tsuchikage?!

173
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:10,564
{\an1}Grampa
Tsuchikage!

174
00:18:10,598 --> 00:18:12,500
{\an1}It's okay, don't worry.

175
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:14,368
{\an1}He is still alive.

176
00:18:14,402 --> 00:18:18,507
{\an1}However...He's
seriously injured.

177
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,855
{\an1}So this is the power
of the Sage of Six
Paths, huh?

178
00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:30,955
{\an1}Magnificent.

179
00:18:33,358 --> 00:18:34,759
{\an1}<i>[satisfied hum]</i>

180
00:18:34,793 --> 00:18:38,864
{\an1}This landscape brings
back so many
memories.

181
00:18:38,898 --> 00:18:43,937
{\an4}You said that your
name was Kabuto...
How much do you
really know about me?

182
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,906
{\an1}Tell me the truth.

183
00:18:45,939 --> 00:18:47,909
{\an1}This is only a
guess, but...

184
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:54,650
{\an4}Back when you battled the
first Hokage Hashirama at
Final Valley, you didn't
actually die on that day.

185
00:18:54,683 --> 00:18:56,719
{\an1}Instead, in
that skirmish...

186
00:18:56,752 --> 00:19:05,395
{\an4}You may have lost to the
First Hokage...But you
gained a portion of Hashirama's
power for yourself in return.

187
00:19:05,863 --> 00:19:07,798
Am I mistaken?

188
00:19:10,902 --> 00:19:12,871
{\an1}Ah, then that's why...

189
00:19:12,904 --> 00:19:15,507
{\an1}I'm able to see
what's coming so well.

190
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,511
{\an1}Then you are also
aware of our plan?

191
00:19:18,544 --> 00:19:23,517
{\an1}Not really; not in detail...
But please remember that
I am your ally.

192
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:30,825
{\an7}However, when it comes to
whether that fake Madara
intends to carry out your plan
exactly...I don't quite know.

193
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:40,804
{\an1}Oh, by the way...Seems
there are still some
survivors here and there.

194
00:19:40,837 --> 00:19:46,511
{\an1}The Tsuchikage and Kazekage
are especially persistent.
What should we do?

195
00:19:46,544 --> 00:19:50,048
{\an1}Before anything else, there
is something I want to
check first.

196
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:52,351
{\an1}Summoning Jutsu!

197
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:54,419
{\an1}<i>[struggling in pain]</i>

198
00:19:54,453 --> 00:19:58,591
{\an1}My stomach!
It feels...so hot!

199
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:03,030
{\an1}This chakra that summons
me...Is it Madara's?!

200
00:20:07,002 --> 00:20:10,605
{\an1}It appears that the
Nine Tails still
remains uncaptured.

201
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:13,776
{\an1}In fact, that's the
entire purpose of
this war.

202
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:17,714
{\an1}The Nine Tails remains
sealed inside a Jinchuriki.
For right now.

203
00:20:17,748 --> 00:20:20,350
{\an1}Just look, he's
right over there.

204
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:25,623
{\an7}That boy is the Nine
Tails' Jinchuriki. His
name is Naruto Uzumaki.

205
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,026
{\an1}Uzumaki...?

206
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,095
{\an1}He's from Mito's
Clan, eh?

207
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:33,399
{\an1}He attacked me earlier.
Nothing but a little brat!

208
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,369
{\an1}Yes, but he's actually
quite the shinobi.

209
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:40,541
{\an4}We will need to capture
him, although that one
right in front of us is
only a clone.

210
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,578
{\an1}Shall we go and capture
the original one now?

211
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:46,682
{\an1}Not yet. There's still
a jutsu I'd like to try out.

212
00:20:46,715 --> 00:20:51,521
{\an4}And I think that it will
make a prettier picture
if I do it where there are
still people around.

213
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:53,356
{\an1}Huh?!

214
00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:57,828
{\an1}It's them! They're
toward four o'clock!

215
00:21:03,602 --> 00:21:07,039
{\an1}Wood Style! Deep
Forest Emergence!

216
00:21:09,076 --> 00:21:11,011
{\an1}He's able to use
Wood Style?!

217
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:13,647
{\an1}I guess this is it
for us, then.

218
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,285
{\an1}<i>[nervous reaction]</i>

219
00:22:58,405 --> 00:23:01,975
{\an1}<i>Damn it! I don't</i>
<i>have much chakra</i>
<i>left at all!</i>

220
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:08,316
{\an1}<i>I'm at my limit!</i>
<i>I'm gonna disappear</i>
<i>at any moment here!</i>

221
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:09,584
{\an1}<i>What am I gonna do?!</i>

222
00:23:09,617 --> 00:23:13,422
{\an1}<i>Naruto, that's enough.</i>
<i>I'll take over the battle</i>
<i>from here on.</i>

223
00:23:13,455 --> 00:23:16,092
{\an1}<i>I have a chance to</i>
<i>reclaim myself now!</i>

224
00:23:16,126 --> 00:23:20,797
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "The Five</i>
<i>Kage Assemble."</i>

225
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,968
{\an1}<i>I'll help you</i>
<i>reclaim yourself.</i>
