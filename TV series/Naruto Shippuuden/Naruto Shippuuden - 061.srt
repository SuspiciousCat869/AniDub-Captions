1
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,250
-You're Sora, aren't you?

2
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:19,152
I've been waiting for you.

3
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,421
-Who are you?

4
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:22,656
-Come on, now.

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,558
Get over here, Sora.

6
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,093
-Hey, answer me.

7
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,461
I asked you who you are.

8
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,396
And how do you know
what my name is?

9
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:30,564
-Over here.

10
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:31,598
Come on.

11
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,700
-Darn it.

12
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:36,637
What is this old man playing at?

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,505
[theme song]

14
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:27,648
-What is it?

15
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:31,385
What are you scheming at?

16
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,086
What in the world is that smell?

17
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,388
[laughter]

18
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:35,222
-Here.

19
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,290
I'll let you try one.

20
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:37,691
-Whoa!

21
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:42,429
It's a baked sweet potato.

22
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,031
[laughter]

23
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,744
-I was getting tired of waiting.

24
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,579
I got so bored I
went ahead and baked

25
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,114
some sweet potatoes for myself.

26
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,019
Hey, this is pretty good.

27
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:10,524
Sora.

28
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,359
Just come over here, will you?

29
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,527
-I don't get it.

30
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,529
You were expecting me?

31
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:19,332
-Come on, you've
gotta be hungry.

32
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,000
Mm.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,101
This is good.

34
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,502
[stomach growling]

35
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:40,554
[stomach growling]

36
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,595
-That's good.

37
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,630
-I told you.

38
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:51,398
Have some more.

39
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,107
-I smell something.

40
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,208
-Huh?

41
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,976
Yeah, the sweet potato
you're eating, dummy.

42
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,646
-No.

43
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,250
I smell it on that
breeze blowing through.

44
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:14,321
It's the aroma of the soil
from Lord Kitane's hidden tomb.

45
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,223
Which means you are
the grave-robber!

46
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:33,106
Right You scum.

47
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,478
-Why couldn't you be quiet
and eat what you were served?

48
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:39,646
-Not gonna happen.

49
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,215
Now you give us back
those four bodies.

50
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:45,285
And if you refuse-- well,
then, you will be punished!

51
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,260
-My boy, I've been getting
punished since the day

52
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,427
I was born.

53
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,564
But the strange thing
is I don't seem to die.

54
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,133
Go ahead, do whatever
you want to me.

55
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:04,504
But you're wasting your
time doling out punishment.

56
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,705
-OK, then.

57
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,308
I will do what I
want to, old-timer.

58
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:11,378
And what I want
right now is you!

59
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,367
-Don't you mess with me!

60
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,735
-What's the matter?

61
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,324
SORA (VOICEOVER):
I don't get it.

62
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,358
Who is this guy?

63
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,081
-Oh, well.

64
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,016
That's the end of him.

65
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,651
I guess I went a
little overboard.

66
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:33,393
And yet-- he'll be fine if
I just dust him off a bit.

67
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,106
-You're mine!

68
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,580
-Wind style, scattering
flower dance.

69
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,657
-She can also use wind style?

70
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:09,596
Earth, fire, water,
lightning, and wind.

71
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,198
She has jutsu of every
single natural property?

72
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,336
-Are you surprised?

73
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,038
Well, you are still a boy.

74
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:21,241
There's so much you don't
know yet about women.

75
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,286
Oh, don't run away yet.

76
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,656
I want to teach you about the
mysteries of the female body.

77
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:37,257
Come here!

78
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,130
-I don't think so, lady.

79
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,400
That's one mystery I'm
really not interested in.

80
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:48,134
Oh boy!

81
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,374
-Fire style, phoenix
flower jutsu.

82
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,720
Water style, mouth
of the serpent.

83
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,495
-Oh, man.

84
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,063
What's going on?

85
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,031
Huh?

86
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,232
Oh, no.

87
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,134
-Lightning style, Earth flash!

88
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,511
-What's the matter?

89
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,247
You hurt?

90
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,315
Had enough already?

91
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,992
-Not on your life!

92
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,060
-You've got spunk.

93
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:04,978
But I think it's about time
you stopped playing around

94
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,446
and show me your true power.

95
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,986
Let's try this again
without your silly toy.

96
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,996
Guess not.

97
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,130
-Where are you going?

98
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:44,084
Wha-- what is this?

99
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,052
But-- this feeling--

100
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,458
You wanted to see my power.

101
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:52,659
That right?

102
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,628
Well, take a good look.

103
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,731
-Now that's what I
was talking about.

104
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,067
Except it's still not complete.

105
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:07,240
Looks like you're finally
taking this seriously.

106
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,511
-Save all your
trash talk for hell.

107
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,279
-Now that's some wind.

108
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,684
-Beast wave gale palm!

109
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:31,246
-Come on, we've gotta
catch up to the others.

110
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,016
I'm worried about
Naruto and Sora.

111
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:36,251
Sai?

112
00:10:36,284 --> 00:10:38,219
Sai?

113
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:41,089
-I-- I just got a
little lightheaded.

114
00:10:41,122 --> 00:10:43,191
We should go find Naruto.

115
00:10:43,224 --> 00:10:45,026
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
The poison's spreading

116
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:46,628
faster than I thought.

117
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:49,798
-Well, Sakura, showing
weakness once in awhile

118
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:51,299
brings people closer together.

119
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:52,767
I read that in a--

120
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:56,905
-So help me, if you say I read
that in a book, I'm gonna--

121
00:10:56,905 --> 00:10:59,174
books are fine for some stuff.

122
00:10:59,174 --> 00:11:02,143
But not the really
important things.

123
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:04,946
There's some things in life you
have to experience first-hand.

124
00:11:08,616 --> 00:11:09,083
-You're right.

125
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:15,890
YAMATO (VOICEOVER):
Where is everyone?

126
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:26,000
-Guess I got no choice.

127
00:11:26,034 --> 00:11:27,202
Shadow clone jutsu!

128
00:11:43,618 --> 00:11:44,619
The wind stopped.

129
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:45,019
Good.

130
00:11:56,664 --> 00:11:57,232
Ah!

131
00:11:57,265 --> 00:11:58,733
What the--

132
00:11:58,766 --> 00:12:00,335
-How dare you?

133
00:12:00,368 --> 00:12:03,638
How dare you do such
a thing to a lady?

134
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:08,309
-Huh-- what-- but she--
was that a substitution?

135
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:12,180
-You have no respect
for women, do you, boy?

136
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:13,915
Do you have any
idea how many years

137
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:17,018
it took to grow this hair?

138
00:12:17,018 --> 00:12:18,620
Hair is vital to a woman.

139
00:12:28,363 --> 00:12:32,033
You have damaged a woman's
most important feature.

140
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:36,371
And now you're
going to pay for it!

141
00:12:36,404 --> 00:12:38,840
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I-- I can't move.

142
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:40,842
Is this some kind
of paralysis jutsu?

143
00:12:46,114 --> 00:12:47,148
-Dammit!

144
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:49,617
She's too fast.

145
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:51,352
-What do you say?

146
00:12:51,386 --> 00:12:54,289
Let's share a little kiss.

147
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:57,091
And when I do, your
soul will be mine.

148
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:57,692
-No!

149
00:12:57,725 --> 00:13:00,028
Stay away!

150
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:00,662
-Now.

151
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,220
-Such pain.

152
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:27,021
Wait.

153
00:13:27,055 --> 00:13:30,158
Where did that old guy go?

154
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:34,062
What-- what happened here?

155
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:35,063
-It was your power.

156
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,936
When you tried to repel my jutsu
you unleashed an amazing power,

157
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,706
and it scarred the landscape.

158
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:46,174
It's what I wanted you to see.

159
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:46,975
Your true power.

160
00:13:50,678 --> 00:13:54,782
-You mean that thing
was my true power?

161
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:56,017
-Exactly.

162
00:13:56,017 --> 00:13:59,354
It's a power given to
you by the heavens.

163
00:13:59,387 --> 00:14:01,990
And it isn't even
fully developed.

164
00:14:02,023 --> 00:14:05,193
You could become
100 times stronger.

165
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:07,362
That much power would
just go to waste

166
00:14:07,395 --> 00:14:10,264
in that little temple of yours.

167
00:14:10,298 --> 00:14:14,102
And that's why you have to
stop and seriously consider

168
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:18,039
how you're going
to use this power.

169
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:20,708
-And just what makes you think
I'm going to listen to you?

170
00:14:20,742 --> 00:14:25,813
-So you'll use the power for
yourself, whenever you see fit?

171
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:29,283
Or maybe you can think
beyond your home and village,

172
00:14:29,283 --> 00:14:34,055
and instead use it for the
good of the Land of Fire.

173
00:14:34,088 --> 00:14:37,625
I know I may only be a
blasphemer with your eyes,

174
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,261
but the four people you
protect in the hidden tombs--

175
00:14:40,294 --> 00:14:42,997
they fought hard for
the Land of Fire.

176
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:47,068
And, yes, died for it.

177
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:49,771
I wonder if divine
punishment would come down

178
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:52,206
on me if they knew
I wanted to use

179
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,410
those bodies for the
good of the Land of Fire.

180
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:58,179
-What do you mean for the good?

181
00:14:58,179 --> 00:14:59,414
-Just that.

182
00:14:59,647 --> 00:15:02,683
I intend to use this power
to preserve our great land.

183
00:15:08,322 --> 00:15:09,924
-That's enough.

184
00:15:09,957 --> 00:15:13,761
I want to know who
you really are.

185
00:15:13,795 --> 00:15:18,633
-The last time I saw you I
was holding you as a baby.

186
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,369
You see, I know your father.

187
00:15:24,338 --> 00:15:25,306
-What did you just say?

188
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:31,179
-Reaper kiss.

189
00:15:36,117 --> 00:15:37,652
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): What?

190
00:15:37,685 --> 00:15:38,086
My chakra--

191
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,029
-Where are we?

192
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:48,629
-Look.

193
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:52,233
-What!

194
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:53,801
Naruto!

195
00:15:53,835 --> 00:15:56,971
Of all the times to-- what
do you think you're doing?

196
00:15:57,004 --> 00:15:57,772
-No.

197
00:15:57,805 --> 00:15:58,806
I think something's wrong.

198
00:16:07,682 --> 00:16:10,384
Are you telling me
you know my father?

199
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:21,696
Naruto!

200
00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:23,064
[scream]

201
00:16:27,635 --> 00:16:28,035
Naruto!

202
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:34,909
-Let Naruto go!

203
00:16:38,946 --> 00:16:39,647
-I got you.

204
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,048
Are you all right?

205
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:42,150
-Captain Yamato.

206
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:43,184
-Wood style.

207
00:16:43,217 --> 00:16:45,720
-We won't let you interfere.

208
00:16:45,753 --> 00:16:50,191
-Earth style, stone
pillar prison jutsu.

209
00:16:50,224 --> 00:16:50,791
-Oh no.

210
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:05,640
FUKA (VOICEOVER):
What is this chakra?

211
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,342
Such evil!

212
00:17:08,376 --> 00:17:08,943
-Fuka?

213
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:19,187
-Why, you-- you--

214
00:17:23,124 --> 00:17:24,825
-You monsters.

215
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:28,296
I hope you have your
tombstones ready.

216
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:30,231
-Sora.

217
00:17:30,264 --> 00:17:31,199
-Who?

218
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:32,667
-It's that boy.

219
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,636
-So he's the one, huh?

220
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:37,338
-I've come to back you up.

221
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:39,941
-Funny, I don't remember
calling for backup.

222
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:42,143
-Then why did I hear
you cry out for help?

223
00:17:42,176 --> 00:17:43,010
-Who, me?

224
00:17:43,044 --> 00:17:44,679
I never called for help.

225
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:46,047
-Really?

226
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:48,749
Well, as long as I'm here, I
guess I'll give you a hand.

227
00:17:48,783 --> 00:17:49,750
Come on.

228
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,052
-OK.

229
00:17:51,085 --> 00:17:53,054
-Both of you, this
fight's too dangerous.

230
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:54,655
Just run!

231
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:55,623
-Not gonna happen.

232
00:18:02,196 --> 00:18:04,131
-It looks like we've
got no other choice.

233
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:04,966
-Heh.

234
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:06,167
Guess it'll be three on two.

235
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:07,201
-Yeah.

236
00:18:07,235 --> 00:18:08,636
More like four on
one, since you'll just

237
00:18:08,636 --> 00:18:09,770
be getting in the way.

238
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,638
-Hey!

239
00:18:10,671 --> 00:18:11,872
-Naruto, don't!

240
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:15,810
-What now?

241
00:18:15,843 --> 00:18:16,310
-No idea.

242
00:18:27,655 --> 00:18:30,825
-Sorry we're late.

243
00:18:30,858 --> 00:18:33,127
But help has arrived.

244
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,762
-Chiriku!

245
00:18:34,762 --> 00:18:36,163
-Lord Chiriku!

246
00:18:36,197 --> 00:18:37,098
-Ha!

247
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:38,766
Now what are you gonna do?

248
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,635
-Shouldn't we be
making our move?

249
00:18:40,668 --> 00:18:41,802
-Absolutely.

250
00:18:41,836 --> 00:18:44,005
There's no need to stall
for time any longer.

251
00:18:48,776 --> 00:18:49,176
-You.

252
00:19:02,623 --> 00:19:03,357
Who is that guy?

253
00:19:09,263 --> 00:19:11,098
I'm going to the Leaf?

254
00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:13,100
-Mm.

255
00:19:13,134 --> 00:19:14,201
-Yes.

256
00:19:14,235 --> 00:19:16,704
We have to head back to
our village temporarily.

257
00:19:16,737 --> 00:19:18,339
The way events
have unfolded here

258
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:21,876
we'll need further
instructions from our Hokage.

259
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:23,744
But our team will
most likely continue

260
00:19:23,778 --> 00:19:27,048
to be assigned to this incident.

261
00:19:27,048 --> 00:19:28,949
So what do you say?

262
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:32,053
Would you be willing to help
us out for awhile, Sora?

263
00:19:32,086 --> 00:19:36,257
As you can see, it'll take
time for Sai to recover.

264
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,859
You're from the Fire Temple
and have experience guarding

265
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:40,661
the hidden tombs,
so I think you'd

266
00:19:40,695 --> 00:19:42,263
be a more than
fitting substitute

267
00:19:42,296 --> 00:19:43,798
for the rest of this mission.

268
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:44,965
-Ah, come on.

269
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:46,701
You don't have to beg
the guy, now, do you?

270
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:48,202
-Naruto.

271
00:19:48,235 --> 00:19:51,205
SAKURA: Think about where you
are before you open your mouth.

272
00:19:51,238 --> 00:19:53,841
That kind of talk could
get you divine punishment.

273
00:19:53,874 --> 00:19:56,043
-Getting a glimpse of the
world outside the temple

274
00:19:56,043 --> 00:19:58,746
might end up doing
you some good, Sora.

275
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:01,282
Either way, only one
person can decide.

276
00:20:01,315 --> 00:20:03,250
You.

277
00:20:03,284 --> 00:20:04,652
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): Odd.

278
00:20:04,685 --> 00:20:10,691
Those traps-- they clearly
weren't left for Chiriku.

279
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:12,293
And that can only
mean one thing.

280
00:20:30,224 --> 00:20:31,758
[music playing]

281
00:22:00,447 --> 00:22:04,151
YAMATO: OK, I have to write up
a report, so I'm out of here.

282
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:06,119
SAKURA: And I have to
take Sai to the hospital.

283
00:22:06,153 --> 00:22:07,754
So-- later.

284
00:22:07,754 --> 00:22:08,488
Let's go, Sai.

285
00:22:08,522 --> 00:22:09,122
SAI: Right.

286
00:22:09,156 --> 00:22:09,756
NARUTO: Huh?

287
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,424
Wait a minute.

288
00:22:10,457 --> 00:22:11,758
I gotta get back to my training!

289
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:13,493
SAKURA: Kakashi-Sensei
isn't back yet, right?

290
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:15,495
So you show Sora
around the village.

291
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:16,730
NARUTO: Not a chance.

292
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,298
Who'd want to hang
around with this guy?

293
00:22:18,332 --> 00:22:18,966
SAKURA: Hey.

294
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:20,434
No complaining.

295
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:22,235
This is something
you have to do.

296
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:25,005
Sora's part of Team
Kakashi now, remember?

297
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:27,908
NARUTO: Next time-- Teammate.
