00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:06,703
{\an1}But you must die.

139
00:11:06,736 --> 00:11:09,637
{\an1}So <i>you'r</i> the
brat that took
down Deidara, huh!?

140
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:12,072
{\an1}Well, I've got
no grudge
against you..

141
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,507
{\an1}But many shinobi
want you dead!

142
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:18,642
{\an1}So, goodbye!

143
00:11:20,376 --> 00:11:23,879
{\an1}Particle Style:
Atomic Dismantling
Jutsu!

144
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:34,484
My name is
Madara Uchiha.

145
00:11:39,454 --> 00:11:40,722
{\an1}Sasuke!

146
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:45,490
I am here to
explain something
to you all.

147
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:49,460
{\an5}And once you
understand it,
I'll ask you a
question.

148
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:58,331
{\an7}To think that even
together, four Kage
weren't able to take
down Sasuke Uchiha!

149
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:02,400
Such is the power
of the Akatsuki...

150
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:06,102
{\an1}But why did they
attack the Five
Kage Summit anyway?

151
00:12:06,135 --> 00:12:09,137
{\an1}Was it merely
to put on a show
of strength?

152
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:12,273
Judging from their
individual actions...

153
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:17,208
{\an5}...it is difficult
to say whether Sasuke
and Madara's objectives
were the same.

154
00:12:17,843 --> 00:12:22,178
{\an8}However... it
seems that Madara
thought, if luck
were on his side-

155
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:26,980
{\an8}-he could take the
five leaders hostage
in order to advance
his own plan.

156
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:30,049
{\an1}What gall! Seizing
the Five Kage!?

157
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,185
{\an1}What is this
plan of Madara's?

158
00:12:33,218 --> 00:12:36,787
He said it was
called "Project
Tsuki no Me"

159
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:45,958
{\an4}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>He already has possession</i>
<i>o seven Tailed-Beasts,</i>
<i>including my One-Tail. </i>

160
00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:51,094
{\an4}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>Madara wants to collect</i>
<i>the last two, and</i>
<i>resurrect the Ten-Tails-</i>

161
00:12:51,128 --> 00:12:54,029
{\an1}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>-The combination of</i>
<i>every Tailed-Beast...</i>

162
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:57,498
{\an4}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>...in order to</i>
<i>make himself the Ten</i>
<i>-Tails Jinchuriki.</i>

163
00:12:58,232 --> 00:13:02,967
{\an4}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>Then using it's power, he</i>
<i>would place the world under</i>
<i>the infinite Tsukuyomi.</i>

164
00:13:03,635 --> 00:13:08,270
{\an7}He'd rule over everyone
everywhere, and control
them completely.

165
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:13,707
{\an7}A world free of
conflict and strife,
isn't that how he
described it?

166
00:13:15,074 --> 00:13:18,643
{\an4}Absurd! Such a
plan would mean
the end of the
world!

167
00:13:19,644 --> 00:13:23,979
{\an1}Exactly. That's the
very reason why we
must stop him.

168
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:27,181
{\an1}That's the Allied
Shinobi Force's goal.

169
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:31,183
{\an7}<i>(Official)</i>
<i>In that case, I worry</i>
<i>about the whereabouts</i>
<i>of Danzo Shimura.</i>

170
00:13:31,618 --> 00:13:35,887
{\an7}I hear he's been
controlling the Hidden
Leaf from behind the
scenes for a while now.

171
00:13:36,086 --> 00:13:42,257
{\an7}I certainly wouldn't want to
get stabbed in the back at
a time when we're all trying
so hard to build solidarity.

172
00:13:42,591 --> 00:13:47,226
{\an4}Yes, we're working
on that. Every hidden
village has men out
there searching for him.

173
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,929
{\an1}Some of the Mizukage's
men came in contact
with him, but... hm?

174
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:55,097
What is it? We're
still in conference!

175
00:13:57,432 --> 00:13:58,999
Come in.

176
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:07,638
Just now, Kakashi
Hatake of The Leaf
sent us a message.

177
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:11,974
{\an1}He and two others ran into
Sasuke and Madara Uchiha
and there was a skirmish.

178
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,576
They confirmed
the death of
Danzo Shimura.

179
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:16,910
{\an3}[gasp]

180
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:19,211
Danzo's really
dead!?

181
00:14:19,245 --> 00:14:20,445
{\an1}What happened!?

182
00:14:20,478 --> 00:14:24,013
{\an1}Someone so skilled
that he became the
Hokage?

183
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,582
Madara and Sasuke?

184
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,685
{\an4}<i>(Anbu Messenger)</i>
<i>Sir! It seems they</i>
<i>used the Transportation</i>
<i>Technique to disappear.</i>

185
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:43,859
{\an7}While the Akatsuki
are certainly strong,
their ability to wage
war is unknown.

186
00:14:43,893 --> 00:14:51,263
{\an7}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>But the true strength of</i>
<i>our Allied Shinobi Forces,</i>
<i>is also unknown.</i>

187

{\an7}<i>(Gaara)</i>

<i>the Akatsuki effectively.</i>

189
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:08,171
{\an7}Above all, we must
win this battle, or
this world will end.

190
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,843
{\an7}Begin stockpiling
ninja tools and
rations!

191
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:18,745
{\an7}Halt all official
missions in
preparation for
battle.

192
00:15:19,112 --> 00:15:22,480
{\an7}Prepare a list
of all shinobi
belonging to
the Village.

193
00:15:22,513 --> 00:15:26,816
{\an7}Tell each platoon
to start preparing
their tactical
plans, now!

194
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:35,187
{\an4}No way! Are you
serious!? Sasuke
attacked the Five
Kage Summit!?

195
00:15:35,221 --> 00:15:38,088
{\an4}I hear they're
just about to
make an official
announcement.

196
00:15:38,122 --> 00:15:41,357
{\an1}There's still lots
of confusion among
the officials.

197
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:47,227
{\an4}So it's really true then!
Sasuke is with the
Akatsuki who attacked
the Hidden Leaf Village!

198
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:51,530
This mess is turning
out to be a real drag.

199
00:15:55,566 --> 00:16:01,770
{\an4}Lady Mizukage's orders!
Inventory all our ninja
tools! Make a list of
anything we're short on!

200
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:06,405
{\an7}[grumble] I don't
know about this
Allied Forces thing.

201
00:16:06,438 --> 00:16:09,607

gonna join up with
those guys from the
Stone.

202
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:15,209
{\an4}The Akatsuki's a despicable
group that brought the
nightmare of the Fourth
Mizukage upon our nation.

203
00:16:15,243 --> 00:16:21,113
{\an5}And the Hidden Stone
has used the Akatsuki
again and again--
until now.

204
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:25,549
{\an4}The higher-ups may
order it, but there's
no way Ganryu will
accept it...

205
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,184
{\an1}<i>(Temari)</i>
<i>You're sure being</i>

<i>How about you?</i>

209
00:16:39,591 --> 00:16:44,493
{\an4}I had to send off messages
to every one of the ninja
who are currently away on
missions.

210
00:16:44,994 --> 00:16:48,095
{\an1}To think... he'd
actually kill a
Hokage...

211
00:16:48,395 --> 00:16:50,563
You mean
Sasuke Uchiha?

212
00:16:50,597 --> 00:16:53,799
I knew he'd fallen,
but I didn't think
he'd fall <i>this</i> far...

213
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,567
However...

214
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:04,638
{\an7}Naruto, you once
told me that you
would become
Hokage one day...

215
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:08,641
{\an7}...Well, I've
become Kazekage.

216
00:17:19,814 --> 00:17:22,916
And if you've
truly resolved to
become a Kage...

217
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:27,618
{\an5}...then you're going
to have to do what
needs to be done, as
Sasuke's friend.

218
00:17:31,654 --> 00:17:33,655
{\an1}[grunt]

219

Naruto didn't
seem to be too
convinced, did he?

220
00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:53,399
{\an1}It's because he
never gives up.

221
00:17:53,432 --> 00:17:57,601
{\an4}Naruto was the one
who changed Gaara,
when even we couldn't
get close to him.

222

seeking the darkness
this time. I don't--

226
00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:20,648
{\an4}It has to be
Naruto's decision.
What he must do as
a friend.

227
00:18:21,982 --> 00:18:29,620

00:20:42,628 --> 00:20:45,130
{\an5}It seems like...
there's something
different about
Naruto now.

264
00:20:45,964 --> 00:20:48,732
{\an1}There is? What
are you talking
about Konohamaru?

265
00:20:48,765 --> 00:20:51,900
{\an4}I don't see
anything different
he looks the same
to me!

266
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:54,635
Yeah, I know,
but...

267
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:59,370
{\an7}<i>(Udon)</i>
<i>So when are we </i>
<i>gonna do the</i>
<i>interview Naruto!?</i>

268
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,139
{\an1}<i>(Naruto)</i>
<i>Man they're fast!</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

269
00:22:58,173 --> 00:23:00,306
<i>(Sakura)</i>
<i>It's Kakashi-Sensei</i>
<i>and Guy-Sensei.</i>

270
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:02,175
{\an1}<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>Those two... Is</i>
<i>it "that" again?</i>

271
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:05,476
{\an5}<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>No doubt about it!</i>
<i>They've rekindled</i>
<i>their rivalry contest.</i>

272
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:10,612
{\an5}<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>Guy-Sensei probably</i>
<i>challenged him... Of all</i>
<i>the times to do this!</i>

273
00:23:10,646 --> 00:23:13,446
{\an4}<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>No, that's exactly</i>
<i>why  he's doing </i>
<i>this now...</i>

274
00:23:13,948 --> 00:23:19,517
{\an5}<i>(Naruto)</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Kakashi</i>
<i>Hatake the Hokage!"</i>

275
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:23,220
{\an1}<i>(Rock Lee)</i>
<i>What a splendid </i>
<i>contest Guy-Sensei!</i>
