We've been going at full
speed since we started.

-Naruto, can I ask
you a question?

115
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:27,300
How long do you think the
Akatsuke have been after you?

116
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:27,801
-Huh?

I don't know.

-Two members of
the Akatsuke came

119
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:46,820
to the leaf looking
for Naruto once.

120
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:51,858
But it's been three years since
then, and no sign of them.

121
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,360
And now they're back.

122
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,895
-But why do you
think they waited

123
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,330
so long to make another move?

124
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,503
KAKASHI: It could be they
wanted to add before this,

125
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,739
but for some reason they
couldn't-- maybe because Master

126
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,209
Joraia was around, and they
didn't want to face him.

127
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,416
LADY CHIYO: That's not it.

128
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,219
From what I've learned, there
was an entirely different

129
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:22,489
reason they had
to wait this long.

130
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:23,857
-What reason?

131
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,960
-If you're going to try and
draw out the tailed beast that

132
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:30,864
dwells within, a great deal
of preparation is involved.

133
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,465
They just needed some more time.

134
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,044
-What are you talking about?

135
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,513
What tailed beast?

136
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:47,647
-My, my.

137
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,816
You're a student of that
old slug queen Tsunade,

138
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,452
and you don't even know
that, when the leaf

139
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,888
itself is host to
the nine-tailed fox?

140
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:55,855
-Huh?

141
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,357
-Oh?

142
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,727
-The nine-tailed fox spirit is
not something we talk about.

143
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,662
It's considered top secret.

144
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,397
-Really?

145
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,767
Well, not surprising, I guess.

146
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,405
Tailed beasts are demon
spirits with one or more tails.

147
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,941
The sand have had a
single-tailed beast

148
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,342
since long ago.

149
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,779
That's the shukaku
sealed within Gaara.

150
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:24,584
-So then there's more
of these demon spirits?

151
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,352
LADY CHIYO: Oh yes.

152
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:30,757
There are a total of nine
of them in the world,

153
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,459
each with distinct
characteristics,

154
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,763
and each with different
number of tails.

155
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,766
The demon beast of the
sand, with its single tail,

156
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,403
a two-tailed spirit,
three-tailed, and so on,

157
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,639
all the way up to that
nine-tailed fox of the leaf.

158
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:50,043
The beasts are huge
concentrations of chakra.

159
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,345
And during the great
war, every nation

160
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,848
competed for control of
them for military purposes.

161
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,551
They fought
relentlessly over them.

162
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:02,755
But the tailed beasts' powers
were beyond human imagining.

163
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:05,959
No one could control them.

164
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,995
I don't know the
intentions of the Akatsuki.

165
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:12,932
But that kind of power is
far too dangerous for anyone

166
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,301
to get a hold of.

167
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,570
Eventually, with
the coming of peace,

168
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,973
the tailed beasts
were forgotten.

169
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:23,009
But nevertheless, they still
exist, all nine of them

170
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,444
scattered over the world.

171
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,662
-Kakashi sent eight
of us ninja hounds out

172
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,098
to scour the countryside,
and try to pick up

173
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,268
the Akatsuki
organization's scent.

174
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,403
Well, we soon
discovered they were

175
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,605
headed for the land
of rivers bordering

176
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,207
the leaf and the sand.

177
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,142
-Land of rivers?

178
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,577
-That's right.

179
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,179
And since your squad is on
its way from the leaf village

180
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,682
to the sand, I guess
this is your lucky day.

181
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:07,487
You're the closest, if
you can call it lucky.

182
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,489
-All right then.

183
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,923
-I'll show you the way.

184
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:14,093
Follow me, and I'll
explain the rest as we go.

185
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:14,827
-Right.

186
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:15,828
You heard him, everyone.

187
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:16,896
Let's move out.

188
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:17,697
-What?

189
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,197
Already?

been discovered.

193
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,873
The enemy approaches.

194
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,842
-Which enemy is that?

195
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,312
-A very skilled
and dangerous one.

196
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,482
His name is Might Guy.

197
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,150
-Might Guy?

198
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,285
Who is he?

199
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:16,289
-An elite leaf Shinobe,
a master of taijitsu.

200
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,358
Don't underestimate him.

201
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:19,992
-Ah.

202
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,527
That strange beast again.

203
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,834
-We'll use that
Jutsu against him.

204
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,068
-I'll go.

205
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,737
Let me take care of him.

206
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,205
It will give me a
chance to make up

207
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,575
for failing to find
a jinchuriki host.

208
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,077
-No, leave him to me.

209
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,579
You see, I know him.

210
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:43,583
I have a personal score
to settle with him.

211
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,586
-Yes, as you have the most
chakra of any of the Akatsuki,

212
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:50,223
you're probably the most
suitable to employ that Jutsu.

213
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,858
Very well, Kisame.

214
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,326
-Excellent.

215
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:58,197
-But I'll still require
30% of your chakra here.

216
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,134
-Well, well, finally.

217
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:05,505
I've been waiting to pay him
back for that kick he gave me.

-Severe leaf hurricane!

-Well, who have we here?

00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:23,823
-The leaf village's
fiercest beast of battle.

I'm Might Guy.

Wait a minute.

person, Guy Sensei?

You didn't cover your
tracks very well, did you?

00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,142
-Well, as I said,
the jinchuriki host

238
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,711
proved more powerful
than we thought.

239
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,681
-You're a bumbler, and a fool.

240
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:06,452
Your methods are too crude for
any sort of secret operation.

241
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,219
-Crude?

242
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,621
Hah.

243
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,123
Those clumsy traps of yours
were hardly subtle, my friend.

244
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:11,991
Hmm

245
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:12,959

-Me.

This time, it must be me.

251

This time, a leaf
shinobe should go.

-Very well.
