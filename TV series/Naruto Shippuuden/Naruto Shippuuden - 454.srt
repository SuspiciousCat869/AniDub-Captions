1
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:19,249
You leaving?

2
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,417
{\an1}Yes, sir.

3
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:22,185
I see.

4
00:00:23,052 --> 00:00:26,622
{\an1}You were only eight when you
awakened your Sharingan,

5
00:00:26,656 --> 00:00:30,358
{\an1}so I suppose the Village
wants to observe your
abilities.

6
00:00:31,226 --> 00:00:36,197
{\an1}This just shows exactly how
much power and influence the
Sharingan holds.

7
00:00:36,731 --> 00:00:38,633
{\an1}I want you to be aware of
that.

8
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:46,306
{\an1}It brings joy to the Clan
when one of its own excels.
Of course, on a personal

9
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:48,908
{\an1}level, I'm very proud of
you, too.

10
00:00:56,915 --> 00:00:58,450
<i>He died... </i>

11
00:00:58,917 --> 00:01:00,084
<i>Father...</i>

12
00:01:01,652 --> 00:01:03,654
{\an1}But make sure that you don't
rest on your laurels just
because you have the

13
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,523
Sharingan now.

14
00:01:05,556 --> 00:01:09,226
{\an1}To sharpen the power in your
eyes, you must continue to
be diligent.

15
00:01:10,227 --> 00:01:13,362
{\an1}Well, I don't need to
lecture you.

16
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,200
I mean... you
are my son.

17
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:24,305
{\an1}<i>(Itachi thinking)</i>
<i>My friend died. But</i>
<i>Father...</i>

18
00:01:24,339 --> 00:01:28,810
{\an1}Yes, Father. I will always
continue to be diligent.

19
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:29,944
Mm.

20
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:31,545
{\an1}Well... I have to go.

21
00:01:37,985 --> 00:01:41,521
{\an1}Big Brother! You said you
were gonna play with me
today!

22
00:01:43,488 --> 00:01:44,757
{\an1}I did, didn't I?

23
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:50,060
{\an1}But I have a mission now.
Sorry, Sasuke. Some other
time, okay?

24
00:01:50,094 --> 00:01:51,462
[groaning]

25
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:54,198
{\an1}I apologize, Sasuke.

26
00:01:54,231 --> 00:01:56,734
But I need your
brother for just a bit.

27
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:44,393
{\an1}"Itachi's Story "Light
and Darkness: Shisui's
Request"

28
00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:46,528
{\an1}<i>Why did you lie to Sasuke? </i>

29
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:49,697
{\an1}<i>He's probably going to</i>
<i>resent me now too, you know.</i>

30
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,501
{\an1}<i>I realize it was wrong of</i>
<i>me... </i>

31
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:57,704
{\an1}B--but Sasuke is a
smart kid. I think
he'll understand.

32
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:02,042
{\an1}My first task is to take
along a genin and secure the
scroll in question.

33
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:08,814
{\an1}Even if this training
exercise required a genin,
it didn't have to be you.

34
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,983
{\an1}Hey! Don't bother
telling me that now.

35
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:15,319
{\an1}Even if it's not a real
mission, Shisui the jonin
requested me.

36
00:04:15,352 --> 00:04:19,057
{\an1}I wouldn't be lying if I
said it's a mission,
though, right?

37
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,524
{\an1}Well, you're half right.

38
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,459
{\an1}Let's go.

39
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:24,560
[grunting]

40
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:29,532
{\an1}So what are the details?

41
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:31,801
{\an1}There are three parts to it.

42
00:04:33,402 --> 00:04:36,838
{\an1}The first part is to find
traces left by a fugitive...

43
00:04:36,872 --> 00:04:38,639
... and use them
to track him.

44
00:04:44,277 --> 00:04:45,946
Hey, not bad!

45
00:04:52,518 --> 00:04:54,720
{\an1}All right, let's just start
from this point.

46
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,631
{\an1}<i>(Itachi thinking)</i>
<i>A footprint left in the moss.</i>

47
00:05:07,664 --> 00:05:10,300
{\an1}<i>He doesn't miss even the</i>
<i>slightest detail.</i>

48
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,836
<i>That's what I'd</i>
<i>expect from Shisui.</i>

49
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:25,780
This is--

50
00:05:25,814 --> 00:05:28,650
{\an1}A broken branch. Our guy
stepped on it.

51
00:05:28,683 --> 00:05:30,784
{\an1}Nice. That was perceptive!

52
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:32,553
{\an1}But I'm afraid it's a decoy.

53
00:05:32,586 --> 00:05:33,287
Mm!

54
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:38,058
{\an1}Dry wood does snap like this
when stepped on, but this
piece is still moist.

55
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:41,828
{\an1}Also, there's a clean cut
here that matches that tree
over there.

56
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:44,463
{\an1}So obviously he was in a
hurry to make a decoy.

57
00:05:45,464 --> 00:05:47,099
{\an1}This is sloppy work.

58
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:54,106
{\an1}Don't be disappointed. An
animal could've left that
indentation in the moss,

59
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:55,639
{\an1}but only humans
make decoys.

60
00:05:55,673 --> 00:05:59,176
{\an1}And if he put his
in that direction... Ah!

61
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,045
A stone?

62
00:06:02,078 --> 00:06:02,912
{\an1}Yes.

63
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,279
Uh!

64
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:06,248
{\an1}Dry underneath,
but damp on top.

65
00:06:06,281 --> 00:06:08,851
{\an1}The fugitive must've
stepped on it and
flipped it over.

66
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,220
{\an1}But could this be a decoy as
well?

67
00:06:11,252 --> 00:06:14,722
{\an1}Could be. At least... it's
a possibility.

68
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:19,594
{\an1}But still... even if it's
only a decoy, the moisture
that's on this stone... can

69
00:06:19,627 --> 00:06:22,496
{\an1}tell us just how long ago he
was here.

70
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:23,964
I see...!

71
00:06:23,997 --> 00:06:27,067
{\an1}From the moisture, it hasn't
been long. He may have left
a trail...

72
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:31,003
[sniffing]

73
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:32,204
You smell that?

74
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:56,993
{\an1}Excellent! C'mon.

75
00:06:57,026 --> 00:06:57,994
Hm!

76
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,369
{\an1}I think it's just a mark
left by a fish.

77
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:10,938
{\an1}Oh, so it's not a
decoy after all.

78
00:07:11,604 --> 00:07:15,276
{\an1}No. That's one of the main
purposes of leaving decoys.

79
00:07:15,308 --> 00:07:17,777
{\an1}Everything starts to look
like it might be one.

80
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:22,381
{\an1}Being able to confuse a
pursuer affords the fugitive
more options.

81
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:26,551
{\an1}At this rate, there's no
way I can find the fugitive
by myself.

82
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:29,387
{\an1}I need to develop better
tracking skills.

83
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,421
[chuckling]

84
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:33,057
[laughing]

85
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,792
{\an1}Maybe, but you're only
half right.

86
00:07:35,826 --> 00:07:36,893
Huh?!

87
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:43,300
[drinking]

88
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:44,233
Go on...

89
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:45,601
Drink up.

90
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:55,609
{\an1}It's actually because
you're a genius, Itachi.

91
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,778
[couching]

92
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,213
That's why...

93
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:02,448
{\an1}<i>I bet you've never tried</i>
<i>to understand the feelings</i>
<i>of someone who isn't. </i>

94
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:03,549
Uh?

95
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,919
{\an1}Having the skills to track
a fugitive is important,

96
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,554
{\an1}but so is understanding
how he thinks.

97
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:13,658
{\an1}If you can understand his
mindset, sometimes you can
thwart a fugitive even

98
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:15,126
{\an1}without strong skills.

99
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,561
Oh, I get it!

100
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:19,630
{\an1}So...

101
00:08:19,663 --> 00:08:22,666
{\an1}Let's move on to the
second part of the training
exercise.

102
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,868
Mm!

103
00:08:26,603 --> 00:08:28,671
{\an1}<i>This is the second part? </i>

104
00:08:28,905 --> 00:08:30,907
{\an1}Yeah... Camping.

105
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,643
{\an1}But Shisui... the handbook
said that campfires are
prohibited.

106
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:38,213
{\an1}So is there another
reason for this?

107
00:08:38,746 --> 00:08:40,015
{\an1}Just eat, okay?

108
00:08:41,415 --> 00:08:43,251
{\an1}You really are a
genius, Itachi.

109
00:08:44,384 --> 00:08:46,786
I'm still very
inexperienced.

110
00:08:47,154 --> 00:08:49,990
{\an1}Earlier, if I just
had more skills...

111
00:08:50,657 --> 00:08:52,859
{\an1}Heh. That's true.

112
00:08:52,893 --> 00:08:54,627
{\an1}Hey, don't laugh at me!

113
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,264
{\an1}I'm sorry but it just
makes me happy.

114
00:08:58,297 --> 00:08:59,899
I don't think
it's funny.

115
00:08:59,932 --> 00:09:01,466
{\an1}<i>Oh! No! </i>

116
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:06,004
{\an1}Please, just listen. I was
only concerned that there
wasn't anything I was going

117
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:08,339
{\an1}to be able to teach you.

118
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:09,340
{\an1}But now...

119
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:11,441
{\an1}You taught me a lot today.

120
00:09:11,475 --> 00:09:14,610
{\an1}Yeah. And that's exactly
what made me happy!

121
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,813
So...

122
00:09:17,847 --> 00:09:18,581
{\an1}Hmm?

123
00:09:18,614 --> 00:09:20,415
{\an1}About this campfire?

124
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:21,384
{\an1}Ah.

125
00:09:22,717 --> 00:09:26,554
{\an1}It's just nice to share a
meal with someone you feel
at ease with.

126
00:09:26,588 --> 00:09:30,891
{\an1}Enjoying a hot meal... helps
you cheer up! That's all.

127
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,960
Heh!

128
00:09:32,993 --> 00:09:34,895
{\an1}Anyway, eat it
while it's hot!

129
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:36,931
[biting]

130
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:42,201
{\an1}Mm! It's warm and tasty!

131
00:09:42,235 --> 00:09:43,169
{\an1}Told you so!

132
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:46,239
{\an1}<i>(Itachi thinking)</i>

I--

00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:02,386
{\an1}Hm?

{\an1}Oh, I see.

141
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:10,626
{\an1}Is that why... you lied?

142
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,697
{\an1}I lied? But I told you
at the start of this
exercise--

143
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,599
{\an1}I think you're very good
at fooling yourself, Itachi.

144
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:22,270
{\an1}That's why you aren't able
to grasp your true feelings.

Uh!

146

at home, right?

147
00:10:27,473 --> 00:10:29,542
{\an1}You had that look on your
face.

{\an1}<i>[blades clinking]</i>

We're here to

00:11:23,122 --> 00:11:24,356
They're ANBU?!

158
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,556
{\an1}Part of the
training?

159
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:28,693
{\an1}No. Just put that
out of your mind.

160
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:31,796
{\an1}Why attack a fellow Leaf
shinobi?

161
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:35,133
{\an1}Would you consider leaving
and forgetting that you saw
this?

162
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:38,335
{\an1}Look, if you're going to
kill a comrade,

163
00:11:38,368 --> 00:11:41,238
{\an1}I can't turn the other
way without a reason.

164
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:45,741
{\an1}The truth is... we're
going after those who
betrayed the village.

165
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:48,044
{\an1}And where's the proof of
this man's betrayal?

166
00:11:48,277 --> 00:11:52,080
{\an1}What a waste of time.
Let's just kill all of
them.

167
00:11:52,113 --> 00:11:53,081
Just wait.

168
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:57,618
{\an1}It isn't exactly that he's
a traitor, but he has
evidence that proves who the

169
00:11:57,651 --> 00:12:00,687
{\an1}traitor is in that scroll
he's carrying.

170
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:04,491
{\an1}If he hands it over, then
we'll be on our way.

171
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,726
Heh-so you say.

172
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,396
{\an1}Sure, you want the
intel, but for what
purpose?

173
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,631
{\an1}Come on, isn't it
obvious?!

174
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:15,901
{\an1}Anyone who threatens
the village must be
punished!

175
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:18,203
{\an1}We will maintain order in
the Hidden Leaf Village

176
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:20,037
through our code
of darkness!

177
00:12:20,472 --> 00:12:23,841
{\an1}You don't have the right
to be judge, jury, and
executioner!

178
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:26,410
{\an1}I'll hand this secret
missive to Lord Hokage.

179
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:29,679
{\an1}And he will deliver a just
and fair judgment!

180
00:12:29,712 --> 00:12:35,751
{\an1}A just and fair judgment?
How naive. You betray the
village, you die.

181
00:12:35,784 --> 00:12:37,419
That's all there
is to it.

182
00:12:37,453 --> 00:12:40,655
{\an1}Even a traitor may have a
reason behind their actions!

183
00:12:40,688 --> 00:12:44,225
{\an1}The Hokage's wish is
to investigate the
situation carefully.

00:12:44,258 --> 00:12:47,061
{\an1}<i>(Itachi thinking)</i>

189
00:12:58,437 --> 00:13:02,907
{\an1}Huh. He substituted
himself out while we were
advising him...

190
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:08,346
{\an1}Don't worry about it. My
wire is coated with poison.
Once his body goes numb,

191
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:10,013
{\an1}He won't get far.

192
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:13,484
{\an1}Instead of with words, you
carry out your purpose
with blades.

193
00:13:13,517 --> 00:13:15,285
Leave it to
the ANBU.

194

peace from the shadows. That
is what a true shinobi is!

196
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,129
{\an1}Then you share the same
beliefs as we do.

197
00:13:27,162 --> 00:13:28,430
{\an1}No, you're wrong!

198
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:32,400
{\an1}You people are seeking to
maintain order only through
the power of the blade.

199
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:35,736
{\an1}That is not true peace!

{\an1}The Uchiha would dare to
push their luck and defy us?

{\an1}We show no mercy, not even
to children.

{\an1}At least make this fun for
us.

209

quickly, he'll die. So
retreat!

{\an1}Don't mock the Uchiha.
And besides, Itachi's
a genius.

so strong. What's going on?

{\an1}My Teleportation Jutsu has

{\an1}When you first awaken the
Sharingan...

279
00:19:09,957 --> 00:19:13,561
{\an1}...sometimes there's a
slight gap between the image
your brain foresees and your

{\an1}body's reaction time.

281
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,634
{\an1}And so, sometimes, when you
try too hard to compensate
for that slight gap...

282
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:21,768
{\an1}...this happens.

00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,097
{\an1}I want you to think of me as
your older brother. You can
depend on me for anything.

294
00:19:56,131 --> 00:19:56,997
{\an1}Mm!

295
00:19:58,299 --> 00:19:59,433
{\an1}Shisui?

296
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:00,267
Hmm?

297
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:01,635
{\an1}About the ANBU...

298
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:05,104
{\an1}Oh... Did I make the right
decision?

299
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:09,275
{\an1}I can't say for sure. I
don't even know if there
is such a thing as justice

300
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,944
{\an1}in the Shinobi World.

301
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,077
{\an1}But that's--

302
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,482
{\an1}We fight believing we're on
the side of justice, but if
the enemy feels the same,

303
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,284
{\an1}how do we know who's
really right?

304
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:22,220
{\an1}You realized that today,
didn't you?

305
00:20:22,253 --> 00:20:24,555
{\an1}There's more than one
side to an issue.

306
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:27,725
{\an1}You must consider
things from various
viewpoints.

307
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:30,427
{\an1}From various viewpoints?

308
00:20:31,361 --> 00:20:34,096
{\an1}You must be tired from using
your Sharingan.

309
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,866
{\an1}Go ahead and sleep.

310
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:41,604
{\an1}But one thing is certain
no matter what happens.

311
00:20:41,637 --> 00:20:44,539
{\an1}I will never, ever betray
you.

312
00:20:45,807 --> 00:20:47,942
{\an1}<i>You never have to worry</i>
<i>about that. </i>

313
00:20:56,182 --> 00:20:58,050
<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>So it's come to this.</i>

314
00:20:58,886 --> 00:21:08,527
<i>Shisui, I'm...</i>

315
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,931
{\an1}I'm starting my new ANBU
assignment today. Itachi
Uchiha.

316
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:14,398
{\an1}<i>I'm glad to be here. </i>

317
00:21:17,268 --> 00:21:19,737
<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>... I'm going to watch</i>
<i>over the Hidden Leaf...</i>

318
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,071
<i>... from within</i>
<i>the shadows.</i>

319
00:22:58,722 --> 00:23:02,892
{\an1}<i>Beginning today, you will</i>
<i>become a squad leader in the</i>
<i>ANBU. </i>

320
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,894
{\an1}<i>You're not part of the</i>
<i>Foundation per se, </i>

321
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:08,097
<i>but your mission</i>
<i>orders will come from me.</i>

322
00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:11,599
{\an1}<i>There's no need to report</i>
<i>anything to Hiruzen and his</i>
<i>staff. </i>

323
00:23:11,633 --> 00:23:12,867
{\an1}<i>Yes, sir. </i>

324
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,770
{\an1}<i>I know it's sudden, but I</i>
<i>have a mission for you.</i>

325
00:23:15,803 --> 00:23:17,270
<i>It's a simple</i>
<i>assassination.</i>

326
00:23:17,304 --> 00:23:21,108
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Moonlit Night." </i>

327
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,275
{\an1}<i>The two behind you will</i>
<i>assist you.</i>
