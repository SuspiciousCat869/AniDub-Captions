{\an1}Thanks for the food!
[exhaling]

2
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:27,105
{\an4}Boy, that sure filled me
up! 'Course, it doesn't
compare to Ichiraku
Ramen! But what can?

3
00:00:27,139 --> 00:00:28,673
{\an1}[grunting]
What's that?

4
00:00:28,706 --> 00:00:32,175
[screaming]

5
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:35,844
{\an1}Oh, it's you again! Why
don't you just give up
already?!

6
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:40,515
{\an5}Look, my business isn't
with you. You're just
the chaperone. I want to
fight the princess that's

7
00:00:40,548 --> 00:00:41,649
next to you!

8
00:00:41,683 --> 00:00:44,017
{\an1}Never! I will not allow
that!

9
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:47,787
{\an1}Lady Shizuka, you don't
need to dirty your hands
with the likes of him!

10
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,256
This is my destiny.
Please just stand back.

11
00:00:53,657 --> 00:00:54,558
{\an1}Huh?

12
00:00:59,562 --> 00:01:05,399
{\an4}How is it you always look
more beautiful? Now
hurry; I want you to be
my wife!

13
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:10,804
{\an1}Huh?

14
00:01:11,203 --> 00:01:12,771
Uh?

15
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:15,874
{\an1}Nadeshiko Style! Roaring
Hurricane Kick

16
00:01:18,776 --> 00:01:21,311
[yelling]

17
00:01:21,812 --> 00:01:22,846
{\an3}Huh?!

18
00:01:25,414 --> 00:01:28,750
{\an1}[screaming]
You'll pay for this!

19
00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:33,921
[cheering]

20
00:01:33,954 --> 00:01:36,189
{\an1}Incredible, Lady Shizuka.

21
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:41,425
{\an4}But now please wait at
the inn. I will check on
the travel arrangements
we've made for the ship.

22
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:42,393
Thank you.

23
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:51,867
{\an4}Whoa, man, that lady...
She's some shinobi. But
it has nothing to do with
me!

24
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,735
{\an1}<i>Sir! Please wait! </i>

25
00:01:53,768 --> 00:01:54,635
{\an1}Huh?

26
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:58,972
From that headband you
wear, I see that you're
a leaf shinobi.

27
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:00,639
{\an1}Huh? Oh. Yeah.

28
00:02:02,174 --> 00:02:06,878
{\an7}May I ask you... about
the Legendary Sannin,
Lord Jiraiya?

29
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:07,745
Uhh--

30
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:09,446
{\an1}<i>Do you know anyone who</i>

{\an1}"The Kunoichi of
Nadeshiko Village"

32
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:02,495
What a surprise, to
find the person we're
seeking, right here.

33
00:04:02,528 --> 00:04:06,431
We were about to board a
ship to sail to the
Hidden Leaf to find you.

34
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:13,037
{\an7}Yeah, it was quite a
surprise to me, too to
hear Pervy Sage's name
out of the blue like that.

35
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,804
{\an1}How'd you know about me?

36
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,673
Didn't Lord Jiraiya tell
you?!

37
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:17,806
{\an1}About what?

38
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,244
{\an1}Then I'll tell you...

39
00:04:22,277 --> 00:04:27,614
{\an4}Your Master Jiraiya had a
connection with my
village that began years
ago.

40
00:04:35,552 --> 00:04:40,257
{\an4}Don't lose him, girls! We'll
teach him what happens to
those who infiltrate our
village!

41
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:47,928
{\an7}Just great... I only came
here to do a little
research for my next
novel.

42
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,666
[sighing]

43
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:57,836
{\an1}[chuckling]
They're so cute,
but so dangerous. Huh?

44
00:05:05,075 --> 00:05:06,609
{\an1}Just give yourself up.

45
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:09,644
Uh! Sorry, but I
just can't do that.

46
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:11,412

{\an1}I'm quite ungraceful so,
hang on!

49
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:23,288
{\an1}Get him!

50
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:24,256
Right!

51
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,701
{\an1}Uh! That's cold!

52
00:05:44,237 --> 00:05:46,504
{\an1}That's rejuvenating.

53
00:05:46,537 --> 00:05:47,538
Huh?

54
00:05:49,073 --> 00:05:52,310
{\an1}I didn't expect you to
chase me this far.

55
00:05:52,343 --> 00:05:56,212
{\an1}The technique you
displayed last night was
simply incredible.

56
00:05:56,245 --> 00:06:01,049
But you didn't just come
here to tell me that, did
you?

57
00:06:01,082 --> 00:06:03,851
{\an1}I've seen your skill and
want to make a request.

58
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:06,552
{\an1}Like what?

59
00:06:06,586 --> 00:06:11,790
{\an8}Hidden Leaf Jonin Lord
Jiraiya... Please duel
with me, and marry me if
you win.

60
00:06:11,823 --> 00:06:15,026
{\an1}Stop! No! Where is this
going?!

61
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:19,595
{\an1}Nadeshiko Village is
matrilineal. It's made up
of only women.

62
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:21,797
{\an1}What?! Seriously?!

63
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,601
{\an5}Those who wish to be
leader leave the village
to find strong men and
challenge them.

64
00:06:26,634 --> 00:06:31,038
{\an1}And then, if those men are
triumphant, they're brought
back to be our husbands.

65
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:32,705
It's the law of
our village.

66
00:06:35,107 --> 00:06:41,145
{\an4}<i>Their duel was a clash of</i>
<i>well-honed ninjutsu</i>
<i>skills... But in the end,</i>
<i>the match was never</i>

67
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:42,946
{\an1}<i>actually decided. </i>

68
00:06:55,522 --> 00:06:56,622
[gasping]

69
00:06:58,457 --> 00:07:02,527
{\an1}<i>So they made a promise.</i>
<i>The duel would be</i>
<i>postponed. </i>

70
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,198
{\an4}<i>And if their rematch</i>
<i>never came to be, their</i>
<i>students were to seek</i>
<i>each other out and finish</i>

71
00:07:08,231 --> 00:07:09,399
{\an1}<i>the fight. </i>

72
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:11,233
{\an1}So you're saying
that...?!

73
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:12,834
{\an3}Hmm.

74
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:17,071
{\an5}You're to duel with Lady
Shizuka, with the reward
being her hand in
marriage.

75
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,639
{\an1}M- Marriage?!

76
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,507
{\an1}Listen, this is all way
too sudden for me!

77
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,743
It's not sudden at all.
It was decided years ago.

78
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:27,279
{\an1}But this is the first
time I'm hearing about
it!

79
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:31,182
Sorry, but that's your
problem! Besides, a
promise is a promise.

80
00:07:31,215 --> 00:07:33,482
We'll be in big trouble
if you refuse!

81
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:36,018
{\an1}Yeah, but I'll be in
big trouble if I agree!

82
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:37,086
{\an1}Anyway--

83
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:39,421
{\an1}...let's just forget we
ever had this conversation!

84
00:07:39,455 --> 00:07:40,888
No! Wait!

85
00:07:43,557 --> 00:07:45,959
{\an7}You will duel. I vow it!

86
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:51,430
[laughing]

87
00:07:51,464 --> 00:07:55,532
{\an1}A marriage proposal, just
like that, huh? You're
quite popular!

88
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:57,434
{\an1}It's not like that, I'm
telling you!

89
00:07:57,468 --> 00:08:01,770
{\an1}Just 'cause Pervy Sage
made some careless promise,
I have to pay for it now!

90
00:08:01,803 --> 00:08:03,571
[chuckling]

91
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:07,375
{\an5}[sighing]
You know... We are on a
secret mission, here, in
case you've forgotten that.

92
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:10,176
We can't get involved in
any foolish distractions.

93
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,945
{\an1}Should we move up our
departure?

94
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:13,879
Yes, good idea.

95
00:08:13,912 --> 00:08:17,315
{\an1}Luckily, we've gotten all
of our supplies
restocked.

96
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:20,617
So let's go to bed early
and leave first thing in
the morning.

97
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:31,992
[snoring]

98
00:08:32,726 --> 00:08:33,693
[grunting]

99
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,964
{\an1}I shouldn't have had so
much tea...

100
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:42,600
Huh?

101
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:46,669
{\an1}Eeeeh.

102
00:08:46,703 --> 00:08:49,805
{\an1}Uh, time out, okay? One
sec...

103
00:08:55,943 --> 00:09:00,247
Stop following me, would
you?! I mean, just leave
me alone, all right?

104
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,417
{\an1}You can't escape me. You
are a prime candidate for
a husband.

105
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:08,986
I already said no! What
more do you want out of
me, anyway?!

106
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:14,090
{\an5}I know that it's your
village tradition and
all. But all it is to me
is weird.

107
00:09:14,123 --> 00:09:16,158
I'm not taking
part in any duel!

108
00:09:16,191 --> 00:09:18,193
{\an1}But--

109
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:20,928
{\an4}<i>If you really want a</i>
<i>fight that badly, go pick</i>
<i>on someone else, would</i>
<i>you?! </i>

110
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,264
{\an1}<i>Please don't say such</i>
<i>things! </i>

111
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:24,597
[gasping]

112
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,867
{\an1}Lady Shizuka doesn't
enjoy this at all,
either, I assure you!

113
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:33,737
{\an1}She's always been
kindhearted and
compassionate.

114
00:09:35,038 --> 00:09:36,806
{\an1}However...

115
00:09:48,182 --> 00:09:50,883
{\an1}I wish we could stay like
this...

116
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,884
Well, then why
don't we?

117
00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:54,419
{\an1}We can't!

118
00:09:56,488 --> 00:10:00,990
{\an4}I understand the position
you're in. But... It's just
ludicrous to pick a husband
only through battle.

119
00:10:01,024 --> 00:10:02,724
{\an1}But, Sagiri...

120
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,863
{\an4}<i>I know that I'm only a</i>
<i>lowly tradesman who's</i>
<i>been allowed into the</i>
<i>village.</i>

121
00:10:08,896 --> 00:10:12,632
{\an1}<i>I'm not a strong</i>
<i>warrior. But I love you</i>
<i>more than anything.</i>

122
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:18,837
{\an4}<i>I just want you to be</i>
<i>happy. So I'll do</i>
<i>everything in my power to</i>
<i>change the village's law!</i>

123
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,873
{\an1}<i>And some day, I will</i>
<i>succeed! I swear it.</i>

124
00:10:34,849 --> 00:10:39,651
{\an1}No one knows for sure,
but some say it was a
plot concocted by a few

125
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:42,488
{\an1}who were concerned about
the village's future.

126
00:10:42,521 --> 00:10:48,192
{\an4}He was attacked and taken
down easily... To prove
that he wasn't fit for
the Nadeshiko.

127
00:10:48,392 --> 00:10:50,193
That's horrible...!

128
00:10:50,227 --> 00:10:54,729
{\an1}And from that day onward,
Lady Shizuka locked away
her heart.

129
00:10:56,865 --> 00:11:03,337
{\an4}<i>She stopped herself from</i>
<i>feeling love... So she</i>
<i>could never again lose</i>
<i>someone she cares for.</i>

130
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:09,508
{\an4}<i>She's only thought of</i>
<i>fulfilling her duty...</i>
<i>of seeking out and</i>
<i>challenging the strong. </i>

131
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:13,877
{\an1}<i>It's as though... she</i>
<i>was punishing herself</i>
<i>for what happened. </i>

132
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:19,848
And that's why you want
me to fight her?!

133
00:11:19,882 --> 00:11:25,852
{\an7}You're the student of the
formidable Jiraiya, who
fought our previous
leader to a draw.

134
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:31,190
{\an7}You may be able to put an
end to Lady Shizuka's
struggles.

135
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:37,861
{\an7}I am fully aware that
this is a selfish request,
but please--will you agree
to fight Lady Shizuka?!

136
00:11:59,211 --> 00:12:01,678
{\an1}I don't believe that
we're being watched
by anyone.

137
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:04,848
Then we should be okay
once we leave this port.

138
00:12:04,881 --> 00:12:08,617
[chuckling]
You just gave up your
chance to become a groom.

139
00:12:11,753 --> 00:12:14,221
This'll buy us a little
time, at least...

140
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:18,458
{\an4}Naruto, I'm deeply
grateful that you've
agreed to fight this
duel.

141
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:22,093
{\an1}Well, I'm really sorry,
but I didn't come here
to fight...

142
00:12:22,127 --> 00:12:23,562
{\an1}I just came
to talk.

143
00:12:23,595 --> 00:12:25,330
What?

144
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:30,300
{\an5}Look, I heard about what
happened to you. And I'm
sorry. But this whole
thing's weird!

145
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:35,504
{\an1}You may not be here to
fight, but I am.

146
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:38,239
{\an1}Now let's find out how
strong you are.

147
00:12:46,445 --> 00:12:48,313
{\an1}This will do fine.

148
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:52,282
{\an1}Earth Style! Iron Prison!

149
00:13:10,697 --> 00:13:12,598
I'm not gonna do this.

150
00:13:12,897 --> 00:13:17,167
{\an1}Don't try to fight
destiny. Please, allow
me to begin.

151
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:18,435
[grunting]

152
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:21,638
{\an1}Nadeshiko Style! Roaring
Gale Chop!

153
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:32,111
{\an1}Nadeshiko Style! Aerial
Dance!

154
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,581
{\an1}Damn! She's got
a lot of those!

155
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:42,620
{\an1}<i>You are indeed strong,</i>
<i>Naruto. </i>

156
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:44,622
{\an1}<i>But you can't just keep</i>
<i>dodging. </i>

157
00:13:47,657 --> 00:13:49,491
{\an1}All right!
Spinning-Waltz!

158
00:13:58,298 --> 00:13:59,999
{\an1}There's just no end to
them!

159
00:14:04,768 --> 00:14:06,169
{\an1}Gale Fan!

160
00:14:14,342 --> 00:14:15,510
[gasping]

161
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,981
[gasping]

162
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:23,982
{\an1}Looks like it's all over.

163
00:14:24,016 --> 00:14:25,550
Yeah, I guess so.

164
00:14:27,386 --> 00:14:28,620
[gasping]

165
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:34,524
{\an1}Now it's over.

166
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:42,363
{\an1}A diversion in the second
stage... No one's ever
gotten behind me.

167
00:14:45,565 --> 00:14:48,000
{\an1}Just deliver the final
blow, then.

168
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:51,336
{\an7}No way. I told you I
didn't come here to
fight.

169
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:53,672
{\an1}I'm not interested in the
duel.

170
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:55,572
{\an1}<i>Then I'll take the woman</i>
<i>for myself! </i>

171
00:14:55,606 --> 00:14:56,507
Huh?

172
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:05,647
[laughing]

173
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:07,481
Now I've got you!

174
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:09,517
What a cowardly attack!

175
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,151
{\an1}This trick is less than
nothing!

176
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:15,454
[chuckling]

177
00:15:19,856 --> 00:15:23,794
[screaming]

178
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:30,131
{\an4}This is called the
Hundred Puppet Bind. It's
a jutsu that drives bolts or
anchor points into my target.

179
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:33,701
{\an1}...each time one of my
hundred puppets is
beaten.

180
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:36,502
{\an1}And now, you've become my
puppet.

181
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:42,039
{\an1}That means... the puppets
from before were all for
this?

182
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:46,577
You coward!

183
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,213
{\an1}Yes, I've done it! And
now Shizuka and Nadeshiko
Village are all mine!

184
00:15:51,246 --> 00:15:52,114
<i>Let her go! </i>

185
00:15:52,147 --> 00:15:53,315
{\an1}Huh?

186
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:56,284
{\an1}We were still talking.
Let her go, now!

187
00:15:56,317 --> 00:16:01,187
{\an4}Just shut up! It's none
of your business! Get
lost! I'm going to take
her away from here and-

188
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,355
{\an1}Huh?

189
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:04,290
[gasping]

190
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,261
{\an1}Rasengan!

191
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:16,098
[screaming]

192
00:16:24,604 --> 00:16:25,938
But why save me...?

193
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:29,842
{\an1}I've had just about
enough of this! Don't
be ridiculous!

194
00:16:29,874 --> 00:16:33,845
No, not that! You had a
chance to defeat me
before!

195
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:36,380
{\an1}And would you have been
satisfied if I did?

196
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,347
[gasping]

197
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:44,753
{\an4}Because it's "destiny," you
locked away your heart and
your whole self just to go
look for a husband?

198
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,387
{\an1}That's crazy!

199
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,356
{\an1}I mean, maybe I don't
know much about marriage
and stuff...

200
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:56,227
{\an4}But aren't you supposed
to be in love with someone
first and be attracted to
who they are deep inside?

201
00:16:56,261 --> 00:16:58,062
Yes, but that's--

202
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,965
{\an1}There's a girl I love.
Her name's Sakura.

203
00:17:01,998 --> 00:17:02,998
{\an3}Uh!

204
00:17:07,636 --> 00:17:10,904
{\an1}Well actually, It is
pretty one-sided on my
part.

205
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,141
[sighing]

206
00:17:15,174 --> 00:17:19,144
{\an1}Sakura is completely in
love with this other guy
named Sasuke.

207
00:17:19,177 --> 00:17:23,313
{\an1}She tries so hard,
pursuing him and trying
to win his love.

208
00:17:28,651 --> 00:17:33,789
{\an7}<i>When she's at it... her</i>
<i>smile is the just about</i>
<i>the cutest thing you've</i>
<i>ever seen. </i>

209
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:38,726
{\an1}<i>I can't explain it, but</i>
<i>before I knew it, I was</i>
<i>in love with her.</i>

210
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:45,129
{\an4}Of course, even if I do
feel that way, I would
never, ever try to force
her to love me.

211
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:47,732
{\an1}I'd be no different from
that guy just now!

212
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:50,100
[chuckling]

213
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:55,404
{\an4}So early on, I made up my
mind. Just like Sakura
always tries so hard to
win Sasuke over...

214
00:17:55,438 --> 00:17:58,339
{\an1}I'm going to try my
hardest to win Sakura
over!

215
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,477
I see. But my destiny is
different...

216
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,879
{\an1}It's not destiny! It's
just some rule your
village made up!

217
00:18:06,913 --> 00:18:08,947
{\an1}And rules were meant
to be broken!

218
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,248
But... But how?!

219
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:16,653
{\an7}[chuckling]
You're smart and strong.
Use your abilities to
put an end to it!

220
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:17,921
[gasping]

221
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:25,125
{\an4}I'm not sure that I
explained it well... but
that's what I wanted to
talk to you about.

222
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,394
<i>Naruto! </i>

223
00:18:27,427 --> 00:18:29,228
{\an1}Captain Yamato!

224
00:18:30,362 --> 00:18:32,997
{\an1}You did it again! You ran
off on your own!

225
00:18:33,264 --> 00:18:34,566
{\an1}[gasping]

226
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:37,534
That's the second time
you've fooled me with a
Shadow Clone.

227
00:18:37,569 --> 00:18:40,002
I hope you're prepared
for the consequences.

228
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,839
{\an1}Oh. Um. I...

229
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:44,774
{\an1}<i>No! </i>

230
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:55,013
We're just about to set
sail.

231
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:57,516
{\an1}I'll be right there.

232
00:18:57,549 --> 00:18:59,685
{\an1}You take care of
yourself.

233
00:18:59,718 --> 00:19:01,285
When your mission is
over...

234
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,621
{\an1}Yeah?

235
00:19:03,654 --> 00:19:08,090
{\an7}When you go back home,
are you going to tell
that person that you love
her?

236
00:19:08,123 --> 00:19:12,527
{\an1}No. I don't think I can
bring myself to do that
yet...

237
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:18,732
{\an1}For right now, I
think that I'll just
keep watching over her.

238
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:21,166
{\an1}And you're satisfied with
that?

239
00:19:25,436 --> 00:19:32,307
{\an4}<i>Of course, nothing would make</i>
<i>me happier than if she</i>
<i>chooses me someday. But,</i>
<i>either way it's okay. </i>

240
00:19:33,308 --> 00:19:36,612
{\an1}<i>I just want Sakura to be</i>
<i>happy. That's all that</i>
<i>matters. </i>

241
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:41,781
{\an7}<i>I just want you to be</i>
<i>happy. </i>

242
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,255
{\an1}<i>Sorry, but this fight</i>
<i>ends now. </i>

243
00:19:53,423 --> 00:19:57,460
{\an1}You see, unfortunately,
I've already given my
heart to another woman.

244
00:19:58,794 --> 00:20:01,963
{\an1}Although it is pretty
one-sided on my part...

245
00:20:01,997 --> 00:20:04,865
{\an1}No kidding... even
for someone like you?

246
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:08,234
{\an1}She's lost all the people
she's loved, one after
another.

247
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:12,571
{\an1}So now she simply rejects
love in order to keep her
heart protected.

248
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,582
{\an1}I've sworn to watch over
her. It's my duty, and I
won't abandon it.

249
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:30,317
{\an1}Even when there's no
reward in it for you?

250
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,418
[laughing]

251
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:35,454
{\an1}As if I care about such a
little thing as that!

252
00:20:35,488 --> 00:20:39,591
{\an5}No, I'm just going to
surround her with love
and hope that she finds
happiness!

253
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:41,559
That's all
that matters!

254
00:20:41,592 --> 00:20:45,628
{\an1}I understand. Well, then,
I guess for now let's
call this a draw.

255
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,465
{\an1}<i>Then... I'll have to</i>
<i>challenge this man's</i>
<i>student! </i>

256
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:55,669
Shizuka...

257
00:20:55,702 --> 00:21:00,205
{\an1}There's no doubt you bear
the burden of your
destiny. However...

258
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:06,044
{\an1}<i>There's no need for you</i>
<i>to lock your heart</i>
<i>away... </i>

259
00:21:08,011 --> 00:21:09,378
Lady Shizuka...

260
00:21:09,412 --> 00:21:11,213
{\an1}Lets go, Tokiwa.

261
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:16,918
{\an1}I will become stronger,
and then one day, when
the time is right...

262
00:21:16,952 --> 00:21:19,153
Yes...

263
00:22:57,091 --> 00:23:02,928
{\an4}<i>It's true. A war that</i>
<i>will decide the future of</i>
<i>the shinobi world will</i>
<i>soon begin. </i>

264
00:23:02,962 --> 00:23:08,133
{\an4}<i>It would be a lie to say</i>
<i>that I'm not afraid. But</i>
<i>whatever happens, I'm</i>
<i>confident that I will</i>

265
00:23:08,165 --> 00:23:09,667
{\an1}<i>come back alive.</i>

266
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,970
{\an1}<i>The reason is because</i>
<i>I have friends that I</i>
<i>trust.</i>

267
00:23:15,404 --> 00:23:19,608
{\an1}<i>Next Time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: Friends You</i>
<i>Can Count On. </i>

268
00:23:19,641 --> 00:23:23,010
{\an1}<i>You'll understand,</i>
<i>too, one day.</i>
