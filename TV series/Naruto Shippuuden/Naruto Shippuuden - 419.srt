1
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,044
{\an1}Guy, why'd you do
such a thing?!

2
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:58,082
Papa...

3
00:01:58,115 --> 00:02:01,055
{\an1}How can you stay so
positive and optimistic?

4
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:02,191
Hm?

5
00:02:03,494 --> 00:02:06,968
{\an1}When does one's youth
really come to an end?

6
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:09,475
{\an1}Well, as long as you never
turn your back against

7
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:11,645
youth, then it
will never end.

8
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:13,349
{\an1}You're saying that youth
doesn't come to an

9
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:14,519
{\an1}end when you die?!

10
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:17,593
{\an1}Oh! C'mon, Guy! That is when
youth reaches its climax!

11
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,763
{\an1}And when it burns the
brightest of all!

12
00:02:19,797 --> 00:02:22,604
{\an1}You're crazy, Papa! Youth
doesn't matter even a little

13
00:02:22,636 --> 00:02:23,973
{\an1}bit when you die!

14
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:25,877
{\an1}You can believe in it until
you die, but there's no

15
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,283
{\an1}guarantee you'll win
against someone strong!

16
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,387
{\an1}Like what happened
to me today!

17
00:02:42,214 --> 00:02:44,920
{\an1}You must understand, my son,
that true victory isn't

18
00:02:44,953 --> 00:02:48,127
{\an1}about winning against
someone strong.

19
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,799
{\an1}What it's actually about is
defending what's most

20
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:52,203
{\an1}important to you!

21
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:53,272
[stunned gasp]

22
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,115
{\an1}I just... I wanted to...

23
00:03:02,124 --> 00:03:06,735
{\an1}I only wanted to defend this
"youth" you keep talking about!

24
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:07,804
[gasp]

25
00:03:12,515 --> 00:03:15,020
[crying]

26
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,150
{\an1}No matter how many times one
does so, deciding someone's

27
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:31,324
{\an1}future is something one
never gets used to.

28
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:32,526
Huh?

29
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:40,944
[chuckle]

30
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,462
Papa!

31
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:49,431
Guy!

32
00:03:51,903 --> 00:03:54,141
{\an1}Looks like those two
are at it again.

33
00:03:54,175 --> 00:03:55,912
{\an1}It's really getting
out of hand!

34
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:57,717
{\an1}Someone should report them!

35
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,589
{\an1}All my son's efforts have
been rewarded!

36
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:03,027
{\an1}I've been accepted
as an alternate!

37
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:06,067
{\an1}So thank you for all
of your support!

38
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:13,117
Clone Jutsu!

39
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:19,197
{\an1}Well, okay. It's a start,
at least.

40
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:24,810
{\an1}Kakashi Hatake! You're next.
Let's see your clone!

41
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:30,288
{\an1}What's wrong? Come up
here and-! [gasp]

42
00:04:32,193 --> 00:04:34,665
No way! Oh! Wow!
Did you see that!

43
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:38,841
{\an1}Wow! Well, there's no denying
that you're Sakumo's son!

44
00:04:39,576 --> 00:04:41,681
{\an1}To do a Multi-Shadow
Clone Jutsu!

45
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:45,189
{\an1}<i>Papa, I think there really</i>
<i>are people who can be</i>

46
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:47,561
{\an1}<i>considered geniuses!</i>

47
00:04:47,594 --> 00:04:48,629
Might Guy!

48
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:51,001
Come on and step
up to the front.

49
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:52,271
Uh... Yes!

50
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:59,019
{\an1}All right, do your
Clone Jutsu.

51
00:04:59,521 --> 00:05:00,690
Yes! Right!

52
00:05:01,023 --> 00:05:03,362
{\an1}That kid can't even
do ninjutsu at all!

53
00:05:04,064 --> 00:05:06,402
{\an1}Aw man, looks like he's
gonna pee his pants!

54
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,240
{\an1}Come on, do it, already!

55
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:09,409
All right, fine!

56
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:11,983
Clone Jutsu!

57
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:28,084
[laughter]

58
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:30,590
{\an1}No way! Who'd wear a
jumpsuit like that?!

59
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:32,595
Seriously! That
thing is way ugly!

60
00:05:40,412 --> 00:05:43,385
{\an1}Like Papa said, I have
something that shines
brillantly!

61
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:47,796
{\an1}Yes! My Taijutsu is already
shining brilliantly!

62
00:05:49,298 --> 00:05:51,770
{\an1}That's right. What they
say doesn't matter!

63
00:05:51,805 --> 00:05:54,209
{\an1}I'm my own person! I'll
follow papa's example

64
00:05:54,242 --> 00:05:57,684
{\an1}and do my best according
to my self-rule!

65
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,464
{\an1}If I can't run five hundred
laps, I'll do five hundred

66
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,166
on my hands!

67
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:07,873
{\an1}If I can't do five hundred
laps on my hands, then I'll

68
00:06:07,907 --> 00:06:10,479
{\an1}just have to do five
hundred push-ups!

69
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:13,352
{\an1}If I can't do the push-ups,
then I'm just gonna have to

70
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:16,158
{\an1}do five hundred of them
on my fingertips!

71
00:06:22,874 --> 00:06:24,110
Fifteen!

72
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,059
[laughter]

73
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:33,664
{\an1}He couldn't do any of the
things he said he could do!

74
00:06:33,698 --> 00:06:35,435
{\an1}He can't even do Taijutsu!

75
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:15,258
{\an1}<i>Papa told me that effort</i>
<i>always, always pays off</i>

76
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,393
<i>in the end!</i>

77
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:21,638
{\an1}[shocked gasping]

78
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:34,768
You fool!

79
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:42,051
{\an1}I have no doubt whatsoever
that, that boy will become

80
00:07:42,084 --> 00:07:43,654
{\an1}your lifelong rival!

81
00:07:45,225 --> 00:07:47,429
{\an1}So why aren't you
challenging him, Guy?!

82
00:07:48,232 --> 00:07:50,669
That's crazy...
He's a genius!

83
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:54,011
{\an1}All that'd happen is I'd
lose! It's obvious!

84
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:55,982
{\an1}And so what if you do lose?!

85
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:57,619
{\an1}Come on! I'll go with you!

86
00:07:57,652 --> 00:07:59,924
{\an1}Let's go find that
Kakashi boy.

87
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:02,529
{\an1}What?! But, no, wait!
Just hold on!

88
00:08:02,563 --> 00:08:06,071
{\an1}All right, look. I'll make a
self-rule about it?

89
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:08,676
Oh? A self-rule!
That's great!

90
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,549
{\an1}If I can do five hundred
laps around the school, then

91
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,120
{\an1}I'll challenge Kakashi!

92
00:08:13,153 --> 00:08:16,127
{\an1}Well said, Guy! Now
that's more like my son!

93
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,966
{\an1}Thank you for your support!

94
00:08:27,954 --> 00:08:29,424
{\an1}Four hundred and ninety-six.

95
00:08:34,634 --> 00:08:35,469
Damn it!

96
00:08:35,502 --> 00:08:37,174
{\an1}Huh? Wait, I'm not exhausted?!

97
00:08:42,987 --> 00:08:44,958
{\an1}I don't feel like I
need to stop, yet!

98
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:47,931
{\an1}That's five hundred laps!

99
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:49,835
I did it!

100
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:52,040
I don't have to
challenge him now!

101
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:57,019
{\an1}If I can do five hundred
laps like this, then I vow

102
00:08:57,052 --> 00:09:00,058
{\an1}to challenge Kakashi and
defeat him!

103
00:09:02,296 --> 00:09:04,000
{\an1}Four hundred ninety-eight...

104
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,713
{\an1}That's five hundred laps!

105
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:12,118
I did it again!

106
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,264
{\an1}Five hundred... Five hundred
and one...

107
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:23,010
{\an1}Five hundred and two...
Five hundred and three...

108
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:26,083
{\an1}Five hundred and four...

109
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:30,058
{\an1}It seems like he's able to
accomplish it so easily.

110
00:09:30,092 --> 00:09:32,030
{\an1}He's really doing it.

111
00:09:41,183 --> 00:09:44,724
{\an1}Seven hundred fourty-nine...
Seven hundred fifty...

112
00:09:44,757 --> 00:09:47,164
{\an1}Seven hundred fifty-one...

113
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:48,833
{\an1}Seven hundred fifty-two...

114
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:50,338
{\an1}Seven hundred fifty-three...

115
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:51,773
{\an1}Seven hundred fifty-four...

116
00:09:51,807 --> 00:09:53,177
{\an1}Seven hundred fifty-five...

117
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,747
{\an1}Seven hundred fifty-six...

118
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,749
{\an1}Seven hundred fifty-seven...

119
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:10,815
{\an1}Oh, I see. So you haven't
been able to challenge

120
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,520
Kakashi, yet.

121
00:10:12,554 --> 00:10:15,293
{\an1}Oh, well! You're still
following your self-rules!

122
00:10:15,327 --> 00:10:16,596
Yeah...

123
00:10:17,331 --> 00:10:19,769
{\an1}You realize it's because
you're doing

124
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:21,407
{\an1}such a good job honing your
strengths, right?

125
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,084
[chuckle]

126
00:10:26,117 --> 00:10:27,621
{\an1}Now, I'm going to challenge
myself by running up and

127
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:30,360
{\an1}down this mountain five
hundred times!

128
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,302
What was...?!

129
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,673
{\an1}<i>If that genius trains just</i>
<i>as hard as I do, then what</i>

130
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,445
{\an1}<i>chance do I possibly</i>
<i>have to beat him?</i>

131
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,392
{\an1}<i>But, I won't lose in hard</i>
<i>work and perseverance!</i>

132

{\an1}Is that boy climbing up
there Kakashi?

133
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:01,597
Hm.

134
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,645
{\an1}I made a mistake.

135
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:10,551
{\an1}There's nothing wrong with
wishing or praying for

136
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:13,858
{\an1}success, as a self-rule.

137
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:17,700
{\an1}He intimidates you,
isn't that right?

138
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,948
{\an1}If I can complete five
thousand laps, then I

139
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,955
{\an1}promise that I'll go and
challenge Kakashi!

140
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:29,024
{\an1}Very well said, my dear son!

141
00:12:39,248 --> 00:12:40,952
{\an1}Do your very best, my son!

142
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:43,056
{\an1}The road of your youth
stretches out boundlessly

143
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,393
before you!

144
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:45,629
{\an1}Three hundred forty-five!

145
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:47,834
{\an1}Run! Run into the sunset!

146

{\an1}[gasp] Five hundred...

00:13:34,705 --> 00:13:37,144
I will not lose!

153
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:42,523
Five thousand!

154
00:13:45,797 --> 00:13:47,233
{\an1}Congratulations, Guy!

155
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:49,170
Thanks, Papa.

156
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,247
{\an1}So this is it! This is what
youth is?

157
00:13:54,717 --> 00:13:56,054
So how about it?

158
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:59,094
{\an1}Let's go lay our youth on
the line in hot-blooded battle!

159
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,822
{\an1}There's no way I'll lose
to you in taijutsu!

160
00:14:12,457 --> 00:14:13,659
{\an1}[grunt] What strength!

161
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:18,570
Leaf Hurricane!

162
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:22,345
Here I come!

163
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:24,249
Bring it on!

164
00:14:24,784 --> 00:14:27,991
{\an1}Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Go! Go!

165
00:14:28,024 --> 00:14:31,465
{\an1}Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

166
00:14:33,103 --> 00:14:36,177
{\an1}Nice job! You've graduated
from the Academy, Guy.

167
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,916
{\an1}But remember, you cannot
graduate from youth!

168
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:42,457
{\an1}Of course! And I don't care
at all if I die as a remnant

169
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,659
of youth!

170
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:46,666
{\an1}I'll stay forever in the
academy that we call youth!

171
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:49,572
{\an1}Thank you for all your
support!

172
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:21,912
{\an1}Operation Cat Rescue is a
success! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

173
00:15:27,892 --> 00:15:31,233
{\an1}Listen to this! Lord Hokage
himself praised me as the

174
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:33,504
{\an1}master of finding lost cats!

175
00:15:33,537 --> 00:15:34,673
Oh...

176
00:15:34,974 --> 00:15:36,711
{\an1}[laughter] Isn't that a
wonderful compliment?

177
00:15:36,745 --> 00:15:39,952
{\an1}But, dad is this really the
climax of your youth?

178
00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:41,289
Hm.

179
00:16:08,482 --> 00:16:09,584
Well...

180
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:12,758
{\an1}Depending on how things go
with the Third Great Ninja

181
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:17,569
{\an1}War, we may end up making
some changes in team formations.

182
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,142
{\an1}But, for right now, I'm
going to be your team

183
00:16:20,175 --> 00:16:22,447
{\an1}captain, Choza Akimichi.

184
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,553
{\an1}Since fate has brought us
all together to be a team, we-

185
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:29,029
{\an1}Please forgive me! I'll never
make this mistake again!

186
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:32,001
{\an1}You say that, but you keep
making the same mistake over

187
00:16:32,035 --> 00:16:33,304
and over again.

188
00:16:33,338 --> 00:16:35,276
I have no choice
but to drop you.

189
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:36,578
{\an1}Please, not that!

190
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:37,580
Um...

191
00:16:37,614 --> 00:16:39,719
{\an1}You keep asking me. But,
frankly, I'm tired of

192
00:16:39,752 --> 00:16:41,823
{\an1}hearing it from you!

193
00:16:41,856 --> 00:16:46,935
{\an1}Please, just give me one
more chance! I'll take any

194
00:16:46,968 --> 00:16:49,975
{\an1}mission at all! I'll work
harder than ever before!

195
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,345
{\an1}Please, I beg you!

196
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,683
{\an1}Please, just, don't
drop me...

197
00:16:59,464 --> 00:17:02,471
{\an1}How can he humiliate himself
like that? I mean, that's

198
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:05,210
{\an1}not what youth's about!

199
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:08,484
{\an1}Maybe. Isn't that how he
raised you, though?

200
00:17:08,517 --> 00:17:09,819
Huh?

201
00:17:09,853 --> 00:17:13,862
{\an1}I don't think that there's a
cooler shinobi out there...

202
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:16,502
{\an1}There's no one who's
quite like your dad.

203
00:17:19,006 --> 00:17:21,880
{\an1}You must understand, my son,
that true victory isn't

204
00:17:21,913 --> 00:17:24,819
{\an1}about winning against
someone strong.

205
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:27,492
{\an1}What it's actually about is
defending what's most

206
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:28,861
{\an1}important to you!

207
00:17:34,742 --> 00:17:35,611
Father...

208
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:38,851
{\an1}Guy, you've become a
fine young man...

209
00:17:40,188 --> 00:17:42,158
{\an1}There's only one remaining
thing that I can

210
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:43,628
do for you now.

211
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:48,071
{\an1}All right, pay very close
attention, Guy.

212
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:54,786
[power yell]

213
00:17:56,658 --> 00:18:00,031
{\an1}[gasp] Father! What's this?!

214
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:03,540
{\an1}It's the Eight Inner Gates.
It's a Forbidden Jutsu!

215
00:18:03,573 --> 00:18:08,049
{\an1}Father's mastered such a move?!
When did he do this...?

216
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,934
{\an1}When I was a genin, I
trained every day and after

217
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:18,840
{\an1}twenty years, I finally
grasped this jutsu.

218
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:20,444
Twenty years!

219
00:18:20,478 --> 00:18:23,217
{\an1}This is really the only move
that I'm able to pass on to

220
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,021
{\an1}you as your father.

221
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:26,824
{\an1}And I'm sure that it will
become a most

222
00:18:26,858 --> 00:18:28,829
{\an1}special jutsu to you.

223
00:18:28,863 --> 00:18:30,701
A special jutsu?

224
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:34,007
{\an1}You've become a splendid
shinobi! But I shall impose

225
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:37,281
{\an1}one strict condition upon
the use of this technique.

226
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:39,520
A self-rule!

227
00:18:40,923 --> 00:18:42,927
{\an1}You're giving me a self-rule?

228
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,431
Father...

229
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:02,405
{\an1}His chakra is spreading toward
the Death Gate Chakra Point.

230
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:10,823
Father, I've...

231
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:17,271
{\an1}The Eighth Gate... of Death!

232
00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:20,712
It's no use.
We've been surrounded.

233
00:19:21,012 --> 00:19:23,184
{\an1}And there's no chance
we can escape...

234
00:19:23,217 --> 00:19:26,958
{\an1}No way. Aren't those the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist?

235
00:19:26,993 --> 00:19:31,235
{\an1}So even brats from other
villages know us?

236
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:34,176
{\an1}It seems that we've
gotten real famous.

237
00:19:34,443 --> 00:19:36,916
{\an1}Oh, what's this? It's
slight, but the blade's

238
00:19:36,948 --> 00:19:38,318
gotten chipped!

239
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:40,657
{\an1}I have to let it drink some
of their blood so that it

240
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,895
{\an1}can restore itself with
the iron within.

241
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:50,211
{\an1}Well? What now? We can't
take them on alone!

242
00:19:52,082 --> 00:19:54,755
{\an1}[chuckle] Ah, ha! I made it
in time!

243
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:55,924
Father?!

244
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:59,766
{\an1}But you're a genin, father!
What're doing here?!

245
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,938
{\an1}Hush and run away, you
three! I'll hold the fort

246
00:20:01,972 --> 00:20:03,374
{\an1}and buy you time!

247
00:20:03,407 --> 00:20:06,515
{\an1}Run away?! But father, our
enemies are powerful jonin!

248
00:20:06,548 --> 00:20:09,153
{\an1}They're the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen of the Mist!

249
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:11,325
{\an1}You don't stand a chance
against any of them!

250
00:20:11,692 --> 00:20:12,962
{\an1}I've got the Gate of Death.

251
00:20:12,996 --> 00:20:15,334
{\an1}I can unleash the Eight
Inner Gates Formation!

252
00:20:15,368 --> 00:20:16,838
{\an1}Yes, but Father, that's...

253
00:20:16,871 --> 00:20:18,407
The self-rule!

254
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,811
[shocked gasp]

255
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:21,649
{\an1}Now's the time...

256
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:25,055
{\an1}Open! Eight Inner
Gates Formation!

257
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:29,198
{\an1}...to protect something precious
enough to give your life for!

258
00:20:31,804 --> 00:20:34,043
{\an1}Guy, you really mean it?!

259
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,147
{\an1}I can't believe this.

260
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:41,860
{\an1}Red vapor. The blood vapor
that's peculiar to all eight

261
00:20:41,894 --> 00:20:43,698
{\an1}gates being open.

262
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:48,307
{\an1}[chuckle] Hmph. But now,
actually seeing it with my

263
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:51,281
{\an1}own eyes, it's almost
the color of dead

264
00:20:51,314 --> 00:20:54,321
{\an1}autumn leaves that have
fallen off their tree.

265
00:20:54,355 --> 00:20:56,827
{\an1}I'll admit, you're not
wrong. But they're not

266
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,631
{\an1}falling without reason
or purpose.

267
00:20:58,664 --> 00:20:59,767
Hm?

268
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,443
{\an1}They'll become the nourishment
for fresh green leaves!

269
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:08,252
{\an1}And thus the period they
bridge, until the new spring

270
00:21:08,285 --> 00:21:12,194
{\an1}when fresh leaves bud once
again, is the climax of youth!

271
00:21:12,528 --> 00:21:14,800
{\an1}When it burns most crimson!

272
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:21,348
