1
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,769
Mh! This is bad!

2
00:00:15,703 --> 00:00:16,504
{\an1}Something wrong?

3
00:00:16,737 --> 00:00:18,606
{\an1}How long until we
reach the island?

4
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:23,009
{\an1}There hasn't been any
wind, so not for a while.
But we're still okay.

5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,346
{\an1}<i>Yeah, we'll be on time to meet</i>
<i>the Tsuchikage's messenger.</i>

6
00:00:27,347 --> 00:00:28,013
Huh?!

7
00:00:28,047 --> 00:00:29,181
{\an1}That'll be
too late!

8
00:00:29,382 --> 00:00:31,517
What?
Chojuro, what is it?

9
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:32,619
{\an1}I'll go on ahead!

10
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:34,987
{\an1}Please follow as
soon as you can!

11
00:00:43,227 --> 00:00:45,396
Hurblh.
I give up!

12
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,167
Even on solid ground,
everything feels wobbly!

13
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:52,270
{\an1}Wow, you've been
seasick this entire
trip, haven't you?

14
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:54,171
{\an1}All the way from
start to finish.

15
00:00:54,205 --> 00:00:55,506
Finish?
Whaddaya mean?

16
00:00:57,341 --> 00:00:59,744
{\an5}After we restock our
supplies, we're going
to head straight on to
the Land of Lightning.

17
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:01,611
Oh, I see.

18
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,648
{\an1}A lot of things happened,
but it seems that we'll
accomplish our mission.

19
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:07,083
Wait, where's
Naruto gone?

20
00:01:07,116 --> 00:01:09,118
[slurp]

21
00:01:10,986 --> 00:01:13,055
[gulp]

22
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:14,590
Ahhh!

23
00:01:14,957 --> 00:01:18,994
{\an1}Miso and pork broth is the best,
but seafood broth's great too!

24
00:01:19,028 --> 00:01:20,129
<i>[Yamato]</i>
<i>Damn it!</i>

25
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:22,298
{\an1}He always seems to dash off
before you can stop him.

26
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:25,468
{\an1}Well, we'll be staying
here for the night,
and it's a small island.

27
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:27,502
{\an1}So I don't
think there's
any harm in it.

28
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:29,738
Oggh,
So dizzy...

29
00:01:29,772 --> 00:01:30,672
Hang in there.

30
00:01:30,705 --> 00:01:31,039
Ngh...

31
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:33,341
<i>[Akatsuchi]</i>
<i>Hmmmm.</i>

32
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:36,544
{\an1}So from here on out,
we'll be in the
Land of Water.

33
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:39,346
I can't believe how
tiny this island is.

34
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:40,314
{\an1}<i>You know...</i>

35
00:01:41,716 --> 00:01:43,784
{\an1}We should stop walking,
or the people we're here
to meet won't find us.

36
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:45,185
So? That's
their problem!

37
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:48,155
{\an1}<i>We got here early, didn't we?</i>
<i>Let's go take a look around</i>

38
00:01:48,188 --> 00:01:49,922
{\an4}Guy, are you feeling
better at all?
<i>while we still can!</i>

39
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:51,558
{\an5}It's taking a while
for you to perk up.
<i>I'm sorry, but</i>
<i>I can't do that.</i>

40
00:01:51,592 --> 00:01:54,795
<i>Lord Tsuchikage has</i>
<i>appointed me as his</i>
<i>official messenger.</i>

41
00:01:55,294 --> 00:01:57,263
{\an1}You just invited
yourself along.

42
00:01:57,296 --> 00:01:59,399
Oh, don't be so
disagreeable,
Akatsuchi.

43
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:02,769
The Land of Water
hasn't had diplomatic
ties with anyone,

44
00:02:02,802 --> 00:02:05,671
so we've never had a
real chance to gather
Intel about it.

45
00:02:06,338 --> 00:02:09,207
{\an1}<i>Our nations are allied now,</i>
<i>but we're still shinobi.</i>

46
00:02:10,843 --> 00:02:13,612
{\an1}Who knows when the situation
is going to change?

47
00:02:14,846 --> 00:02:16,782
You the messengers
from the Tsuchikage?

48
00:02:16,815 --> 00:02:17,582
Huh?

49
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:20,985
Maybe. Who're you?

50
00:02:21,952 --> 00:02:22,788
I'm the one...

51
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:24,688
Who'll kill you!

52
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:30,227
- Aah! Run! Run!
- Get outta here!

53
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:31,695
Hm!

54
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:32,996
Watch out!

55
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:38,635
{\an1}Hey, you know we're part
of the Allied Shinobi
Force, right?!

56
00:02:39,836 --> 00:02:41,271
So back off!

57
00:02:41,304 --> 00:02:43,239
Shut up and die,
Stone ninja!

58
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:45,675
{\an1}Just who are you people?!

59
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:48,477
Huh?

60
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:51,680
Ah! That's...!

61
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,249
Auuggh!

62
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:56,418
Akatsuchi!

[struggling]

64
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:07,930
Hey!

65
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:10,398
{\an1}Why are the Stone and
Mist fighting here?

66
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:12,032
{\an1}Yeah, that's what
I want to know!

67
00:03:12,065 --> 00:03:14,402
{\an1}These guys just attacked
us right out of nowhere!

68
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:15,770
{\an1}What is up
with that!

69
00:03:15,803 --> 00:03:17,337
Move it,
Leaf ninja!

70
00:03:17,672 --> 00:03:19,005
Nngh!

71
00:03:19,306 --> 00:03:20,640
{\an1}You know I
can't do that.

72
00:03:21,141 --> 00:03:22,108
{\an1}But I'll stop you!

73
00:03:24,845 --> 00:03:25,779
Out of the way!

74
00:03:26,178 --> 00:03:27,279
Haugh!

75
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:34,955
{\an1}What did you--

76
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:38,524
{\an4}Even if you're from the Leaf,
if you interfere--

{\an1}<i>[Chojuro]</i>

81
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:53,605
No. This ends now.
It violates Lady
Mizukage's will.

82
00:03:53,638 --> 00:03:55,038
Per her orders,

83
00:03:55,874 --> 00:03:58,208
I'm going to have to
stop you right now!

84

{\an1}What?

86
00:04:07,251 --> 00:04:08,485
They disappeared!

87
00:04:09,285 --> 00:04:11,622
{\an1}So, um...
Is everybody all right?

88
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:12,656

{\an1}You're...
scaring me...

92
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,229
Talk! Why'd you

You're not a very smart

Why do you keep
calling me an

And who were they?!

123
00:07:08,852 --> 00:07:11,889
{\an1}I recently received a
message from Lady Mizukage.

124
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:15,458
{\an1}Several shinobi have
suddenly dropped out of
sight in the village.

125
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:18,995
{\an1}<i>They all oppose the alliance</i>

That's right.

129
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:29,938
{\an1}He's the sole survivor of
an incident known as the
Tragedy of Yosuga Pass.

Okay, and what
happened there?

131
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:37,779
{\an4}I'm certain you're already
aware of this, but there's
a deep hostility between
the Mist and Stone.

132
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,649
{\an1}<i>The Yosuga Pass incident</i>

133
00:07:45,653 --> 00:07:49,957
{\an1}<i>Ten-odd years ago the Hidden</i>
<i>Cloud went around collecting</i>
<i>jutsu from each Nation.</i>

134
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:53,460
{\an1}<i>They seized a highly</i>
<i>confidential document</i>
<i>from us.</i>

135
00:07:54,061 --> 00:08:00,700
{\an4}<i>That same day, a team from the</i>
<i>Mist led by Ganryu was to meet</i>
<i>with allies from the Stone in</i>
<i>order to recover the document. </i>

136
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:09,641
{\an1}Stay alert. The Cloud
is just up ahead.

137
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:13,579
Not to worry.
We'll have help from the
Stone from here on out.

138
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,615
{\an1}That may be so,
but still...

139

If this mission
is a success,

140
00:08:19,952 --> 00:08:24,223
{\an1}we'll show everyone that
there is true solidarity
between the Stone and Mist.

141
00:08:25,556 --> 00:08:28,459
{\an1}And that way, we'll get a
little bit closer to peace.

{\an1}Yes, Suiren.

143

{\an1}And I hope with all my heart
that it will come true someday.

145
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,643
{\an1}Why?!
Why do this?!

146
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:50,213
{\an1}The Stone and Mist are
supposed to be allies!

147
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,315
Hand it over.

148
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:57,153
{\an1}Our mission is to bring
that document back.
And we will have it.

{\an1}What wish? What are
you talking about?

248
00:15:15,303 --> 00:15:18,607
{\an1}An act of revenge would threaten
the stability of the alliance.

249
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,109
{\an1}That will force the Five Kage

{\an8}<i>Naruto Uzumaki.</i>

294
00:18:13,402 --> 00:18:16,638
{\an1}I understand. And I'll
put my trust in you, too.

295
00:18:17,004 --> 00:18:17,773
Huh?
Huh?

296
00:18:18,939 --> 00:18:19,907
<i>[Chojuro]</i>
<i>Stop right there!</i>

297
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,609
Huh?

298
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:25,379
{\an1}I'm taking you into custody.
And if you should try to
resist me...

299
00:18:25,613 --> 00:18:26,480
{\an1}<i>[clang]</i>

300
00:18:26,514 --> 00:18:27,181
Eh?

301
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,918
I have no intention at
all of resisting you.

302
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,387
{\an1}And please, tend
to his wounds.

303
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:37,257
{\an1}Hey, Mist guy!
How's Akatsuchi?!

304
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,793
I left a Medical Ninja
to treat him.

305
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,095
<i>But his injuries aren't</i>
<i>life-threatening.</i>

306
00:18:42,662 --> 00:18:43,763
Thank goodness.

307
00:18:44,764 --> 00:18:45,598
And Ganryu.

308
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:47,933
I brought this.

309
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:51,236
{\an1}<i>The messenger you injured</i>
<i>entrusted this to me.</i>

310
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:56,874
{\an1}[gasp] But this is...

311
00:18:57,776 --> 00:19:01,112
{\an1}<i>He was returning the effects of</i>
<i>those who died at Yosuga Pass.</i>

312
00:19:01,346 --> 00:19:03,881
{\an1}<i>Along with a formal apology</i>
<i>for that incident.</i>

313
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:09,687
{\an4}That was the true purpose
behind the messengers that
were dispatched to the
Mist by Lord Tsuchikage.

314
00:19:10,954 --> 00:19:12,089
{\an1}The Hidden Stone...

315
00:19:13,324 --> 00:19:15,158
{\an1}...has actually apologized?!

316
00:19:17,227 --> 00:19:19,096
{\an1}That stubborn old
man said sorry?

317
00:19:20,263 --> 00:19:24,568
{\an1}This was done in order to
strengthen the new alliance
between the Mist and Stone.

318
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:31,407
I see.

319
00:19:33,676 --> 00:19:36,278
{\an1}So what now?
What happens to him?

320
00:19:39,615 --> 00:19:41,916
{\an1}<i>[Chojuro]</i>
<i>He will either be</i>
<i>executed or released.</i>

321
00:19:42,984 --> 00:19:47,322
{\an1}He committed a serious offense.
But he's prepared to
face the consequences.

322
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:50,558
<i>[Akatsuchi]</i>
<i>I don't believe that</i>
<i>it will come to that.</i>

323
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:51,559
{\an1}Hm?

324
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:55,363
{\an1}I only got hurt because
I took a wrong turn,
stumbled, and fell.

325
00:19:56,865 --> 00:19:57,965
Right, Kurotsuchi?

326
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,969
{\an4}You're not doing this
to make up for what
happened to you in
the past, are you?

327
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:06,939
{\an1}Hm. I'm just going to have
the Mist owe us one.
That's all that's going on.

328
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:13,881
{\an4}You know, Maybe the old
geezer wasn't the only one
who had a change of heart
because of the Kazekage.

329
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:14,782
{\an1}Kazekage...?

330
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:21,387
Hey, Mist guy!
Don't forget
you owe us one!

331
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,656
{\an1}Oh! Right!
Thank you very much!

332
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,725
{\an1}And you, Leaf underling!

333
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:27,559
Huh?

334
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,327
{\an1}Wait, is your
wound still?

335
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,697
{\an1}I'm sorry. I have comrades
waiting. I'll see ya!

336
00:20:34,965 --> 00:20:37,034
{\an1}He could've at least
introduced himself!

337
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:42,239
{\an1}<i>[Yamato]</i>
<i>What did you get yourself</i>
<i>into this time?!</i>

338
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,509
{\an1}Heh heh heh heh heh!
You know, it's kinda
embarrassing.

339
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:47,678
{\an1}I took a wrong turn
and just fell!

340
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:50,448
You what? You fell?!
Where was this?

341
00:20:50,848 --> 00:20:53,584
{\an1}Is that really all
you have to say
about this, Aoba?!

342
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:54,551
Look, forget it!

343
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:59,622
{\an1}We're leaving tomorrow, right?
Let's just get everything ready
and then go to bed early!

344
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:02,358
{\an1}Actually, we've had a
little change of plans.

345
00:21:02,392 --> 00:21:05,961
{\an1}The ship from the Land of
Lightning is going to come
and pick us up directly.

346
00:21:05,994 --> 00:21:06,729
Really?!

347
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,598
{\an1}It should be here any moment.

348
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:13,902
{\an1}Oh! Here it
comes now!

349
