something right for a change.

166
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,733
All of the elder generations'
failures in the Sand

167
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:18,003
and in the Leaf can
now be put behind us.

168
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:22,174
May the future that
awaits you be different

169
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:25,410
from the way things
were in our time.

170
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,946
-Next time, "The Legacy!"

171
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:39,758
[MUSIC - ALUTO, "MICHI TO YOU
ALL"]

172
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:45,430
-Today's subject is an event
that shook the Leaf Village

173
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,835
to its core, the attack of
the Nine-Tailed Fox spirit.

174
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:54,273
The aptly named Nine-Tailed Fox
is a creature out of legend.

175
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:56,942
No one really knows
why it attacked,

176
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,410
but it brought
the greatest power

177
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:04,283
in all the five great nations to
the very brink of destruction.

178
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:07,319
The village was saved from
this unprecedented crisis

179
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:09,788
by the fourth Hokage.

180
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,190
In exchange for his
own life, the fourth

181
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,994
sealed the Nine-Tailed Fox away
within the newly born Naruto

182
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,896
Uzamaki.

183
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,265
Judging by the type
of seal, the Hokage

184
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:24,036
likely believed Naruto would one
day be a powerful shinobi who

185
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:28,273
could use the Nine-Tail's power
for the good of the village.

186
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:30,809
So you're shouldering a
heavy responsibility, Naruto.

187
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,881
-An order of miso ramen.

188
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,916
-Well, once step
at a time, I guess.

189
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,818
-Don't hold back on the pork.
