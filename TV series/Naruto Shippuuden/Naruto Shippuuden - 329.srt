00:01:55,054 --> 00:01:55,788
Ha!

2
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,262
{\an1}Damned Naruto! He pulled out
the rod! Well, then...

3
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,535
Rasengan!

4
00:02:17,044 --> 00:02:19,848
{\an1}You did it! Nice work!

5
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,186
{\an1}What?! Why is that
chain still there?!

6
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:27,856
{\an1}Huh... I guess this
one won't go away.

7
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:31,060
{\an1}But why?! I took out the
rod, just like you told me!

8
00:02:31,394 --> 00:02:36,500
{\an1}All that rod does is
temporarily bind my chakra
to the Jinchuriki's body.

9
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:42,072
{\an1}But my chakra itself, that
masked guy owns through the
Gedo Statue.

10
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:46,578
{\an1}You already knew about
that?! Then I didn't end up
saving you at all!

11
00:02:48,413 --> 00:02:50,616
{\an1}Do you really mean what
you're saying?

12
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,385
Of course I am!

13
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:55,821
{\an1}[heavy breathing]

14
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:04,364
{\an7}<i>This kid is really serious...</i>

15
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:11,439
{\an4}I told you how you
could stop me. But I didn't
actually tell you how you
could save me.

16
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:14,842
{\an1}You should have just
told me that right from
the beginning!

17
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:18,347
{\an1}Man, why can't you Tailed
Beasts be more
straightforward?!

18
00:03:18,747 --> 00:03:19,715
[annoyed sigh]

19
00:03:19,748 --> 00:03:21,550
{\an1}All right. What do I do?!

20
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,755
{\an1}Before I tell you, there's
something I want to pass on
to you.

21
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,090
What?

22
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,292
{\an1}Hold out your hand...

23
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:32,028
{\an1}You're gonna give
me something?

24
00:03:32,062 --> 00:03:37,635
{\an1}It's something good. It'll
come in handy one of these
days. Now hurry up!

25
00:03:51,818 --> 00:03:53,119
[chuckles]

26
00:03:53,152 --> 00:03:55,689
What is- ?!

27
00:04:03,732 --> 00:04:08,203
{\an1}The statue absorbed Four
Tails! I guess that he still
belongs to him!

28
00:04:17,813 --> 00:04:22,418
{\an1}[heavy breathing]

29
00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:30,394
{\an4}You look like you're about
to pass out after stopping
just one Tailed Beast. You
cannot defy me!

30
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:34,131
{\an1}I shall take the precious
Tailed Beasts that you
possess.

31
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,770
{\an1}What's going on?!

32
00:04:41,874 --> 00:04:45,444
[roaring]

33
00:04:48,347 --> 00:04:53,520
{\an1}This is bad, however you
look at it. And you're all
worn out...

34
00:04:53,553 --> 00:04:57,658
Yeah, well...
Just watch me...

35
00:04:58,057 --> 00:05:03,597
{\an1}If you want me to lend you
strength, I wouldn't mind,
Naruto.

36
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:06,133
{\an1}[heavy breathing]

37
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:10,005
{\an1}You know something? You sure
do talk to me a lot lately.

38
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:16,978
{\an4}I'm glad you want to lend
me power, but before you
do, there's something I
have to say to you.

39
00:05:20,818 --> 00:05:23,252
{\an1}Thanks for helping me with
the other Madara.

40
00:05:24,488 --> 00:05:26,088
{\an1}All that extra power...

41
00:05:27,157 --> 00:05:28,860
{\an1}That really helped.

42
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:31,930
{\an1}Don't thank me! It
weirds me out!

43
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:36,301
{\an1}I only did what I did
because I'd rather deal
with you than with Madara!

44
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:42,040
{\an1}Besides, thanks to this
cage, I could only give you
a tiny bit of chakra!

45
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:48,113
{\an1}I'm merely interested in
watching you fight a little
longer! That's right...

46
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,049
{\an1}Just to pass the time!

47
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:53,320
{\an1}Hey! Why do have to get all
weird just because I thanked
you?!

48
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:58,459
{\an4}And you look mad all the
time! You really need to
work on your attitude! I
mean, you're always like--

49
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:06,300
{\an1}Just hit my chakra with
yours...

50
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:10,072
{\an1}Oh, man. Chakra tug-of-war
again?

51
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:11,139
Idiot!

52
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:13,576
We don't have to
do that now!

53
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,815
{\an1}Although, it's not like I've
got anything else to do, so
we could if you want!

54
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,439
[chuckle]

55
00:06:41,106 --> 00:06:42,508
[chuckle]

56
00:06:50,884 --> 00:06:53,086
{\an1}Let's do this, Octopops!

57
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,025
{\an1}Right! We'll fight as a
two-man team with me taking
the lead.

58
00:06:57,057 --> 00:07:00,662
{\an1}Listen, Naruto, you just
cover my back, agreed?

59
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:05,400
{\an7}Against five Tailed Beasts,
you can't go in front when
you can't undergo Tailed
Beast Transformation!

60
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:10,739
{\an7}Octopops, you and Eight-o
are both injured right now.
There won't be any leading
or following!

61
00:07:10,773 --> 00:07:12,608
{\an1}We're going in together!

62
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,376
Hey... Naruto!

63
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,047
{\an1}Since, we're both already
in two-man teams!

64
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:21,151
{\an1}Hold on, Naruto. Don't tell
me you and Nine Tails...

65
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:24,287
{\an1}I've still got tons of
reserve power to use!

66
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,103
{\an1}So it's true! Iruka Sensei
never believed in me!

67
00:07:38,136 --> 00:07:39,872
{\an1}That is how beasts are.

68
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:46,279
{\an1}However... that's not who
Naruto is! Not at all!

69
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:52,586
{\an1}Naruto's one of a kind.
Works hard, puts his whole
heart into it.

70
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:57,626
{\an1}Sure, he messes up.
And gets jumped on.

71
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,431
{\an4}..but his suffering only
makes him stronger. That's
what separates him from
being a beast.

72
00:08:06,102 --> 00:08:09,405
{\an1}So you're wrong, he's
nothing like the Nine-Tailed
Fox.

73
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:17,447
{\an1}He is a ninja of the Hidden
Leaf Village. And his
name... is Naruto Uzumaki!

74
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:33,164
You're no longer
the demon fox...

75
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,772
{\an1}You are a partner of a
citizen of the Hidden Leaf
Village...

Kurama!

77
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:45,846
{\an1}Now let's do this!

78
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:09,505
Naruto... Don't
tell me you...

79
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,647
{\an1}[gasp] This is really bad!

80
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,248
Guy! Don't move!

81
00:09:18,282 --> 00:09:20,684
{\an1}I'll blast them away
with my Kamui!

82
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:24,155
{\an1}There's too many!
That won't cut it!

83
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,591
{\an1}I'll just have to open
the Eighth Gate!

84
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:29,161
{\an1}No, you fool! If you do
that, then you'll die!

85
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:31,097
Yes, but...

86
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:36,435
{\an4}Naruto! Looks bad over
there! Five Tailed Beast
Bombs in the air, pointed
at them!

87
00:09:36,469 --> 00:09:37,403
Yeah, I know!

88
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:38,772
I'm on it!

89
00:09:41,975 --> 00:09:43,477
What?! So fast!

90
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:45,312

{\an1}[gasp] Is that Naruto?!

93
00:10:12,076 --> 00:10:13,177
The mountains...

94
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,679
{\an1}That's the power of the
Tailed Beasts?!

95
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:19,717
{\an1}He deflected them all?!
In that case...

96
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:24,156
Incoming!

97
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:26,458
{\an1}Let's go, Kurama!

98
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,030

[roar]

100
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:49,617
{\an1}Was Naruto able to pull
off a Tailed Beast
Transformation?

101
00:10:49,651 --> 00:10:51,119
That Nine Tails...

102
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:53,655
{\an1}What is going on?!

103
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:57,193
{\an1}We're inside Nine
Tails' Chakra?!

104
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:02,598
{\an1}First we have to find out
where every one of their
rods are!

105
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:09,005
{\an4}Just so you know, we don't
have much time. It's our
first Tailed Beast
Transformation, and

106
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,743
{\an1}the link isn't perfect.
We've got about five
minutes!

107
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:14,078
That's plenty!

108
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:18,382
[attacking yell]

109
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:22,287
{\an7}There's a whole bunch
of you, so I can't be as
gentle as I was with Son.
Just bear with me, all right?

110
00:11:35,336 --> 00:11:36,402
[growl]

111
00:11:53,022 --> 00:11:55,625
{\an1}Not gonna fall for
that trick twice!

112
00:12:01,497 --> 00:12:02,431
Take this!

113
00:12:10,842 --> 00:12:13,211
Okay! I found
every last one!

114
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,081
{\an1}This... This fight is like
an all out monster smack
down!

115
00:12:17,715 --> 00:12:22,187
{\an1}He exceeded my expectations.
I'll have to go after him
like I mean to kill.

{\an8}[screeching]

117
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:43,378
{\an1}Hey, úuh... Isn't that pretty
big for one of those things?

118
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:46,348
{\an1}Are they pooling their power
into a single point?!

119
00:12:46,848 --> 00:12:48,884
{\an1}Naruto! So what now?!

120
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:59,662
{\an1}An equal force to cancel
theirs out?! But he's never
succeeded at that...

121
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,565
{\an1}He did it a few times by
accident in training.

122
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:05,302
{\an1}But I know that he'll
get it right this time!

{\an1}Tailed Beast Bomb!

124
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:37,504
{\an1}He aimed it low so it would
bounce them up, which is
good... But still, it's big!

125
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:40,108
{\an1}Nine Tails really is
super-strong!

126
00:13:48,117 --> 00:13:49,718
{\an1}I've grabbed all their rods!

127
00:14:00,563 --> 00:14:03,100
{\an1}Let's do this, Kurama! Pull
'em all at once!

128
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:08,773
{\an4}We're going to free them
all! We'll get every single
rod out and save everyone!
Got it?

129
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:18,051
{\an1}We've been waiting...

130
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:22,121
The same thing
happened with Son...

131
00:14:22,155 --> 00:14:25,492
{\an1}Not quite. You did make it
all the way to this plane
this time around...

132
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,794
{\an1}Just as Four Tails
predicted...

133
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:30,931
This isn't where
Four Tails was...

134
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:33,033
Huh?

135
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:37,072
{\an4}Now that we are fully
linked, you're able to
enter deeper than before
into the Tailed Beast

136
00:14:37,105 --> 00:14:38,740
Psyche Plane.

137
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,212
See! There are
Jinchuriki here too!

138
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:47,850
{\an1}Plus, Four Tails was bound
by Chakra Chains, remember?

139
00:14:48,717 --> 00:14:53,256
{\an4}Well, honestly I don't
really get it, but
everyone's here and there
aren't any chains. It's not

140
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,158
as crazy as it
was the last time!

141
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:59,062
{\an1}That jerk in the mask cannot
penetrate this deep.

142
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:05,203
{\an1}Welcome! And thank you! On
behalf of us Jinchuriki and
Tailed Beasts.

143
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:08,739
{\an1}I wanted to meet you,
Naruto Uzumaki!

144
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:10,509
In fact... Huh?!

145
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:15,482
{\an1}Oh, man! You look like
you're shorter, younger and
weaker than me!

146
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:21,121
{\an4}Being a Jinchuriki is hard!
You must've had it rough!
Knowing you went through
that!

147
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:25,359
{\an1}And now, just look at you!
You're already dead!

148
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:32,199
{\an4}It's so sad! You never got
to eat good ramen! Or even
find out what it felt like
to kiss a girl!

149
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,803
{\an1}Hey! You've never kissed a
girl either, Naruto!

150
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:41,143
{\an1}Actually, the only person
you've ever really kissed...
is Sasuke.

151
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:45,414
{\an1}Agh! Come on! Don't
make me remember that!

152
00:15:45,448 --> 00:15:49,752
{\an1}Whoa, now that is a lot of
heaving! Sasuke? Kisses?
What was that like?

153
00:15:50,454 --> 00:15:55,058
{\an1}Hey, you do know that I'm
talking to you, don't you?!
Honestly, Four Tails is right!

154
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:57,861
You don't listen
very well at all!

155
00:15:57,895 --> 00:16:00,498
{\an1}Wait, what? Four Tails?

156
00:16:00,532 --> 00:16:03,768
{\an1}So... do you mean that Son
was here, as well?

157
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:05,303
{\an1}Yes, that's right...

158
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:06,639
Finally!

159
00:16:07,138 --> 00:16:08,574
Hm?

160
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:11,477
{\an1}Which means that old man
with the beard was here,
too?

161
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,612
That's right!

162
00:16:12,646 --> 00:16:14,481
{\an1}Make sure to tell him.

163
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:19,352
{\an1}Oh, and I was also able to
give him just a tiny bit of
my chakra.

164
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:27,328
{\an1}Do all of you still remember
what Old Man Six Paths told
us at the very end?

165
00:16:28,296 --> 00:16:30,698
Well, I think
this kid is it...

166
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:37,539
{\an4}That's how it feels to me...
I wager he'll probably come
here to try to help you
guys, too.

167
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:43,613
{\an1}If he does, do good by him,
understand? I'm being pulled
back into the statue...

168
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:45,448
{\an1}So goodbye for now.

169
00:16:46,216 --> 00:16:47,618
Four Tails...

170
00:16:47,984 --> 00:16:49,653
{\an1}Perhaps, just maybe...

171
00:16:50,853 --> 00:16:52,789
{\an1}Do you think that...

172
00:16:53,524 --> 00:16:56,661
{\an1}...you and I could've
traveled a different path,
too?

173
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:06,439
[chuckle]

174
00:17:08,341 --> 00:17:13,112
{\an7}This from you, who's
even more stubborn than
Tsuchikage Ohnoki? Have
you gone soft after death?

175
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:20,754
{\an4}Well, maybe if you'd tried
to remember my name... right
when you first became my
Jinchuriki!

176
00:17:22,523 --> 00:17:27,028
{\an1}Nope, I still haven't gone
quite soft enough to start
calling you by your name...

177
00:17:27,362 --> 00:17:30,633
{\an1}Not even after being your
Jinchuriki for over forty
years...

178
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:33,636
{\an1}But then again, I haven't
forgotten it, either!

179
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:38,575
{\an1}All right, then say my full
name now, spiel and all.

180
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,077
{\an1}[chuckle] Is "Son"
good enough?

181
00:17:52,356 --> 00:17:55,359
{\an1}We assembled here because of
Four Tails' summons...

182
00:17:55,393 --> 00:17:59,531
{\an1}And we hung around after
promising to tell and give
you something.

183
00:17:59,564 --> 00:18:02,534
{\an1}Wow... He really did all that?

184
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:08,641
{\an4}[chuckle] Well, I'm glad
that you're all gathered
together and you're all
getting along, too!

185
00:18:08,675 --> 00:18:14,047
{\an1}Yes, but that only happened
after Four Tails and Roshi
left here, Naruto.

186
00:18:14,847 --> 00:18:16,717
{\an1}It's all thanks to you.

187
00:18:17,651 --> 00:18:21,822
{\an1}Naruto, step forward.
Extend your hand...

188
00:18:21,855 --> 00:18:26,061
{\an1}We'll fulfill our promise
to Four Tails, or rather
Son Goku.

189
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,599
{\an1}My name is Matatabi.

190
00:18:31,032 --> 00:18:32,568
Yugito Ni'i...

191
00:18:33,235 --> 00:18:36,739
{\an1}My name is Isobu. We've met
before, huh?

192
00:18:37,173 --> 00:18:40,711
{\an1}And I am Yagura, the
former Fourth Mizukage.

193
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:43,714
I am Kokuo.

194
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,248
I'm Han.

195
00:18:45,282 --> 00:18:48,051
{\an1}Me, I be called Saiken.

196
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:50,488
{\an1}We meet again. I'm Utakata.

197
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:53,224
{\an1}I'm Lucky Seven Chomei.

198
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:55,126
The name's Fuu!

199
00:19:15,949 --> 00:19:17,985
{\an1}I will not live much longer...

200
00:19:18,018 --> 00:19:26,261
{\an1}Shukaku, Matatabi, Isobu,
Son Goku, Kokuo, Saiken,
Chomei, Gyuki, and Kurama...

201
00:19:26,294 --> 00:19:30,031
{\an1}Even if you're far apart,
you'll always be together.

202
00:19:30,465 --> 00:19:34,504
{\an1}Eventually the day will come
when you will be united
again, each of you with a

203
00:19:34,537 --> 00:19:37,507
{\an1}unique name and a
different form than before.

204
00:19:37,974 --> 00:19:42,846
{\an1}And unlike when you were
inside of me, you will be
guided down the right path.

205
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:46,651
{\an1}I hope you learn what true
strength is...

206
00:19:47,384 --> 00:19:49,521
{\an1}Before that time comes...

207
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:07,407
{\an8}<i>It took a long</i>
<i>time, Old Man.</i>

208
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:10,343
[powerful yell]

209
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:16,384
{\an1}Don't you all agree? That
Naruto is the Old Man's...

210
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:18,820
Yes!

211
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:20,321
Y-Yup!

212
00:20:21,222 --> 00:20:22,891
Yeah!

213
00:20:23,826 --> 00:20:25,561
Indeed...

214
00:20:26,562 --> 00:20:27,729
Definitely...

215
00:20:41,612 --> 00:20:43,681
{\an1}Nicely done, Naruto!

216
00:20:44,148 --> 00:20:47,552
{\an1}I never thought you'd be
able to completely control
Nine Tails.

217
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:55,327
{\an4}However, it appears as
though you still cannot
maintain it for long. So
same old, same old.

218
00:21:15,115 --> 00:21:17,252
{\an1}It's not the same
old, same old...

219
00:21:18,753 --> 00:21:23,592
{\an1}Not anymore! I just learned
a whole bunch of really
difficult names all at once!

220
00:22:58,765 --> 00:23:03,336
{\an4}<i>Naruto's gained so much</i>
<i>experience and strength.</i>
<i>It makes me feel quite</i>
<i>old and feeble.</i>

221
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:09,644
{\an4}<i>You're not being yourself! I</i>
<i>hate to be the one to say</i>
<i>it, but the springtime of</i>
<i>our youth is far from over!</i>

222
00:23:09,677 --> 00:23:11,880
{\an1}<i>We still have a lot</i>
<i>of work to do!</i>

223
00:23:11,913 --> 00:23:15,417
{\an1}<i>Oh, be quiet! You want me to</i>
<i>feel worse?</i>

224
00:23:15,751 --> 00:23:19,221
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Promise of</i>
<i>Victory"</i>

225
00:23:19,822 --> 00:23:22,659
{\an1}<i>Ah, that's the Guy I know!</i>
