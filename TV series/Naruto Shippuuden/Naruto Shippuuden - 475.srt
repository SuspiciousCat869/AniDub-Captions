{\an1}Yeah. All that's left is...

42
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,062
{\an1}Alright, Naruto and Sasuke...
About what I asked you two
before...

43
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:31,233
{\an1}Having battled my mother
Kaguya... is there any change to
the answers you gave me?

44
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:39,404
{\an1}My answer's the same. And I'm
sorry, Super Gramps, but after
fighting Kaguya...

45
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:43,072
{\an1}...there's just one thing I feel
strongly about...

46
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:48,709
{\an1}I'm just really happy that my
mom was Kushina Uzumaki, y'know!

47
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:52,744
{\an1}<i>Kaguya was different from anyone</i>
<i>else I've ever fought against...</i>

48
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:56,213
{\an1}It's like she didn't even have a
heart at all...

49
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:02,382
{\an1}Long ago, it was said that my
mother Kaguya started off as a
beloved goddess of the people.

50
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:07,219
{\an1}I'm not certain what made her
transform into a being that was
called a demon.

51
00:06:08,052 --> 00:06:14,223
{\an1}<i>I suspect that the process, or</i>
<i>something, started after she</i>
<i>devoured the Chakra Fruit.</i>

52
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:21,392
{\an1}In any case, you are not like my
mother. I trust you not to
become like her, even if...

53
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:24,561
{\an1}...you have all the Tailed
Beasts' Chakra in you.

54
00:06:25,395 --> 00:06:30,397
{\an1}Now then, all that's left... is
to undo the Infinate Tsukuyomi.

55
00:06:30,898 --> 00:06:35,567
{\an7}<i>But how, specifically? Are you</i>
<i>going to need our powers, as</i>
<i>well?</i>

56
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,670
{\an1}No, all of you are just fine.
Naruto possesses the chakra of
every Tailed Beast.

57
00:06:41,704 --> 00:06:48,875
{\an4}<i>And Sasuke posseses the</i>
<i>Rinnegan. If they both weave the</i>
<i>sign for rat simultaneously, the</i>
<i>jutsu will be undone.</i>

58
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:52,409
{\an7}<i>What? That's it? It'll really be</i>
<i>that easy?</i>

59
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,379
{\an1}Believe me, I researched
thoroughly how to undo Mother's
Infinite Tsukuyomi.

60
00:06:58,246 --> 00:06:59,714
{\an1}There's no mistake.

61
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:04,415
{\an1}Very well, then. Now, Sasuke,
the rest... is up to you.

62
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,888
Yeah, alright...

63
00:07:14,555 --> 00:07:18,557
{\an1}But before that, I'm executing
the current Five Kage inside the
Infinate Tsukuyomi.

{\an1}Huh?

67
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:37,534
{\an1}What about the Five Kage?

68
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,368
{\an1}And you Tailed Beasts...

69
00:07:40,802 --> 00:07:46,137
{\an1}I'm putting all of you under my
control, and eventually, I'll
get rid of you as well.

too...

feared. I've no choice but to
trust you to handle this.

longer. I shall soon fade away.

this too, Six Paths Super

like it did with your kids.

{\an1}I... I know in my heart that
there's nothing I can do, even
though I love you!

137
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,631
{\an1}<i>Even though I care so much about</i>
<i>you, Sasuke!</i>

138
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:53,967
{\an1}<i>I can't get close to you or</i>
<i>exchange blows with you.</i>

139
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,770
{\an1}I can only whine, beg, and cry,
yet again.

140
00:13:58,803 --> 00:14:01,304
{\an1}It's so pitiful, isn't it?

141
00:14:05,173 --> 00:14:06,140
Sakura...

142
00:14:08,408 --> 00:14:09,341
I thank you.

143
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,377
{\an1}But... but please, Sasuke!

144
00:14:14,411 --> 00:14:19,814
{\an4}If there's even a little corner
of your heart that still thinks
about me, don't leave again!
Please!

145
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:27,485
{\an1}<i>If we just stick together... I</i>
<i>know that it can be like old</i>
<i>times again... someday...</i>

146
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,787
You really are...

147
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:33,788
{\an1}...still incredibly annoying.

148
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,126
[gasp]

149
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:52,965
Sakura!

150
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:55,967
{\an1}You didn't need to put Sakura
under genjutsu!

151
00:14:56,466 --> 00:14:57,467
{\an1}If I didn't...

152
00:14:58,734 --> 00:15:01,469
{\an1}...then she would've just chased
after us and gotten in the way.

153
00:15:02,137 --> 00:15:06,806
{\an1}Sakura... Sakura just wanted to
help you. All this time...

154
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,473
{\an1}You're suggesting that I enjoy a
romance?

155
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:13,977
{\an1}Too bad I have no reason to love
her or to be loved by her.

156
00:15:14,676 --> 00:15:20,780
{\an4}The only time that you need a
reason like that is when you
want to <i>hate</i> someone! Don't you
understand?

157
00:15:20,813 --> 00:15:23,348
{\an1}Sakura isn't even trying to make
you hers!

158
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:32,519
{\an4}She only wants to save you! She
almost died by your hand, but
even now... She still spills
tears for you!

159
00:15:32,552 --> 00:15:34,954
{\an1}<i>She suffers from loving you!</i>

160
00:15:37,822 --> 00:15:39,157
Uh, hey Mom...

161
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:40,290
Hm?

162
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:46,293
{\an1}I was wondering... It's about my
brother and me... What does
father really think of us?

163
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,461
{\an1}Hm? What on earth makes you ask
that?

164
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:54,731
{\an1}The other day, down on the dock,
father said to me, "That's my
boy."

165
00:15:55,465 --> 00:16:01,002
{\an1}That's something he's only ever
said to Itachi. So it made me
really happy to hear it.

166
00:16:01,035 --> 00:16:01,902
[chuckle]

167
00:16:01,935 --> 00:16:04,435
{\an1}I see... that's great to hear.

168
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:09,772
{\an1}But then I started to wonder,
now that Father and Itachi
aren't getting along...

169
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:13,340
Am I just...

170
00:16:13,374 --> 00:16:15,775
{\an1}...someone to replace my older
brother?

171
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:19,778
[sigh]

172
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:25,281
{\an1}Your older brother's your older
brother, and you're you.

173
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:29,783
{\an1}Believe me, your father has
always cared very deeply about
the both of you.

174
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,350
{\an1}He's only thought of Itachi
before now!

175
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:33,852
{\an1}<i>If it seemed that</i>
<i>way...</i>

176
00:16:35,653 --> 00:16:38,788
{\an1}...the reason for that's simple.
It's because your father is a
leader of the Uchiha Clan...

177
00:16:38,822 --> 00:16:41,256
{\an1}and he has to make sure that
it's kept safe and secure.

178
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,723
{\an1}What's that got to do with it?

179
00:16:42,757 --> 00:16:46,026
{\an1}Your brother is the first born.
He's older than you are.

180
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:53,663
{\an1}<i>So, since it's your father's job</i>
<i>to look after the clan...</i>

181
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:58,531
{\an1}<i>it's only natural he'd want to</i>
<i>be sure that Itachi's ready to</i>
<i>take on his role.</i>

182
00:16:58,565 --> 00:17:00,999
{\an1}But I'll let you in on a secret.

183
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:06,102
{\an1}When we're alone and no one's
around, the only one that he
talks about is... you, Sasuke!

184
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:12,272
{\an1}He's so serious, and he has a
hard time showing his feelings;
it's how he is.

185
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:26,113
{\an1}Got your lunch ready.

186
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:27,113
Time to go.

187
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,616
{\an1}And after you get home today,
I'll watch you practice your
shuriken jutsu. Okay?

188
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,550
{\an1}It's not "practice." It's called
training.

189
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:35,585
See you later!

190
00:17:35,918 --> 00:17:37,153
Have a great day!

191
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,456
{\an1}Well, perhaps, those are merely
the ties to a failed past.

192
00:17:47,924 --> 00:17:48,758
{\an8}<i>Sasuke...!</i>

193
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,593
{\an7}(NARUTO) <i>I made a promise...</i>

194
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:55,461
{\an1}To Sakura a long time ago...

195
00:17:56,196 --> 00:17:59,264
{\an1}Don't you worry one bit. I'm
gonna bring Sasuke back.

196
00:17:59,931 --> 00:18:01,932
{\an1}I promise that on my life
Sakura!

197
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:06,268
{\an1}Well, Sensei... You already know
my Ninja Way, right?

198
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:07,768
I'm gonna go!

199
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,105
{\an1}Alright... We're counting on
you.

200
00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:25,745
{\an1}(HAGOROMO) <i>Love and affection</i>
<i>are difficult things...</i>

201
00:18:26,778 --> 00:18:29,412
{\an1}I too, had two children at one
time.

202
00:18:30,014 --> 00:18:33,649
{\an1}I loved both of them, and they
both loved and revered me.

203
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:37,918
{\an1}<i>But I entrusted everything </i>
<i>only to the younger brother.</i>

204
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:46,422
{\an4}<i>That became the impetus for the</i>
<i>older brother to begin hating me</i>
<i>and his brother. Love had</i>
<i>transformed into hate.</i>

205
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:52,926
{\an1}<i>What molded the current</i>
<i>Sasuke... is none other than his</i>
<i>loss of love in the past.</i>

206
00:18:54,526 --> 00:18:55,760
{\an1}<i>Madara was the same.</i>

207
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:03,098
{\an1}Are you saying that Sasuke... is
going to suffer the same fate as
Madara?

208
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:04,932
{\an1}No, I'm not at all.

209
00:19:05,132 --> 00:19:09,434
{\an1}I also want to make the future a
better place, in my own way.

210
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:12,236
{\an1}Having learned from my past
mistakes...

211
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,238
{\an1}This time I gave both of them
the power instead.

212
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:21,141
{\an1}The past insn't there to
remind the present that the
future can't change.

213
00:19:21,174 --> 00:19:24,176
{\an1}The past is supposed to exist
for the future.

214
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,410
{\an1}Why exactly do you see potential
within Naruto?

215
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:38,416
{\an4}Somehow, that boy was able to
save and befriend Kurama, who
had become a concretion of
hatred.

216
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:41,585
{\an1}I think I shall let Naruto
handle this...

217
00:19:42,252 --> 00:19:46,254
{\an1}<i>...since I hope that hate can be</i>
<i>transformed into love this</i>
<i>time...</i>

218
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:51,590
{\an1}<i>Or rather... I have hope that</i>
<i>love can be regained.</i>

219
00:19:55,558 --> 00:20:03,063
{\an1}<i>Since, unlike my mother...</i>
<i>Naruto, as well as Sauke...</i>
<i>knows what love truely is.</i>

220
00:20:04,064 --> 00:20:09,066
{\an1}This place, huh? Should've
figured. Brings back memories,
right, Sasuke?

221
00:20:09,466 --> 00:20:13,735
{\an1}This place was where we battled
against each other. Seems so
long ago...

222
00:20:14,202 --> 00:20:18,805
{\an1}It'll be the same now. Just like
the last time... you're going to
lose here.

223
00:20:18,838 --> 00:20:23,674
{\an1}But you aren't gonna be able to
hit me with the same punch as
last time!

224
00:20:23,707 --> 00:20:26,742
{\an1}<i>There's no way I'm gonna let you</i>
<i>get away with whatever you want.</i>

225
00:20:28,077 --> 00:20:31,812
{\an1}And trust me, Sasuke you're not
gonna be Hokage, either!

226
00:20:31,845 --> 00:20:35,414
{\an1}You don't even seem to
understand what it means to be
Hokage.

227
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:40,582
{\an1}I told you, being Hokage means
revolution to me.

228
00:20:40,816 --> 00:20:43,052
{\an1}It's totally different than what
you believe.

229
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,887
{\an1}Your big brother once said
something to me. Lemme tell
ya...

230
00:20:47,321 --> 00:20:51,389
{\an1}Becoming Hokage isn't all about
getting people to acknowledge
you.

231
00:20:51,722 --> 00:20:55,391
{\an1}<i>Only those already acknowledged</i>
<i>will ever become Hokage.</i>

232
00:20:55,824 --> 00:21:00,894
{\an1}Well, I learned not from
Itachi's words, but by the way
that he lived his life.

233
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:08,231
{\an1}You and I simply arrived at
different conclusions. Let me
clarify this before we fight...

234
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:13,867
{\an1}I'll teach you exactly what
being Hokage means to me now.

235
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:14,734
[scoff]

236
00:22:56,922 --> 00:23:00,891
{\an1}(NARUTO) <i>You really don't have</i>
<i>any clue at all about how Itachi</i>
<i>lived!</i>

237
00:23:00,924 --> 00:23:07,527
{\an4}(SASUKE) <i>As of now, Itachi is</i>
<i>entirely in the past. I'm</i>
<i>cutting ties with past mistakes</i>
<i>and doubts.</i>

238
00:23:08,528 --> 00:23:15,766
{\an4}<i>I'm going to begin by cutting</i>
<i>you down. Yours will be the last</i>
<i>blood that I shed in the memory</i>
<i>of my late brother.</i>

239
00:23:16,532 --> 00:23:20,201
{\an1}(NARUTO) <i>Next time of Naruro</i>
<i>Shippuden: "The Final Battle."</i>

240
00:23:21,202 --> 00:23:22,568
