43

it through this time, too.

{\an7}Yep! You guys have

running three days and
three nights without sleep

46

so proud that I can
hardly stand it!

47

{\an1}Why, it takes me back to
the time when I took the
Chunin Exams...

48
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:45,178
{\an1}Sensei... If this
is a long story...

{\an1}Please, just let us rest
already. Plus, I'm starving!

50

Seems so...

51
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,200
We have never been to
the Hidden Sand before&

52
00:05:57,233 --> 00:06:00,139
{\an1}It really is nothing
but desert.

53
00:06:00,172 --> 00:06:03,578
{\an1}Although, to be accurate,
this isn't the Hidden
Sand Village.

54
00:06:03,611 --> 00:06:06,516
{\an1}In fact, we're actually
quite far away from it.

55
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:09,755
{\an1}Are you saying you have
been to the Hidden Sand
Village before?

56
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:12,360
Once on an errand
for the Hyuga.

57
00:06:12,393 --> 00:06:15,132
This is called the Demon
Desert checkpoint.

58
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:19,773
{\an1}Really? No kidding?
So this is what they're
gonna use.

59
00:06:19,807 --> 00:06:24,316
You know, taking the
Exams in a different
village is a bit stressful.

60
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:28,724
{\an1}I wonder what the Second
Round is going to be like.

61
00:06:28,757 --> 00:06:31,963
{\an1}It'll probably be just like
the last Chunin Exams.

62
00:06:31,997 --> 00:06:35,068
{\an1}So we compete against
the other teams?

63
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:37,339
There's a good
chance of that.

64
00:06:37,373 --> 00:06:41,246
{\an1}Then we are going to have
to be cautious of some teams.

65
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:45,888
{\an1}We went at full-speed, and
yet we were not the first
to arrive here.

66
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:49,061
{\an1}Yeah, the Hidden
Waterfall was the first.

67
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:53,268
And not only that, but
they also arrived here
long before we did.

68
00:06:53,302 --> 00:06:57,509
{\an1}So just what kind of
opponents are they...?

{\an1}Well, it took an idiot like that
to stop all that ruckus& Hm.
Sort of  reminds me of someone.

162
00:12:41,403 --> 00:12:44,008
Yeah... Naruto.
Don't you think
so too, Lee?

contact, that you are quite
different than all the others.

166
00:12:56,664 --> 00:12:59,369
{\an7}You were able to stop my
attack so easily back there.

167
00:12:59,402 --> 00:13:03,343
{\an7}It may sound arrogant
to say this, but

168
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:05,881
{\an7}it takes someone
extraordinary to do
something like that!

Shira... Huh?

176
00:13:27,888 --> 00:13:31,695
I don't know what you
sensed back there, but...

177
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,333
{\an1}...dwelling on the misfortunes
of birth is meaningless.

178
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:38,775
For all the flaws and
suffering, we have just
one life, this one.

179
00:13:38,808 --> 00:13:43,182
And to my mind, there
is only one truth to
be found in life.

180

{\an1}There is only
one truth in life?

{\an1}<i>and bring them back to the base</i>
<i>located in the center of the</i>
<i>Demon Desert.</i>

286
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:46,521
{\an1}You have seventy-two
hours. And you must find
food on your own!

287
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:53,333
{\an7}There will be fatalities from
here on. So each participating
team member will sign a consent
form!

288
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:57,374
{\an7}When you turn in the
team consent forms, you
will be given a scroll!

289
00:20:57,408 --> 00:21:04,320
{\an7}<i>Furthermore, to avoid any </i>
<i>confusion, each team will start</i>
<i>from a different location.</i>

290
00:21:04,354 --> 00:21:08,060
{\an7}<i>So all of you...get to your</i>
<i>starting points quickly!</i>

291
00:21:08,896 --> 00:21:14,372
{\an1}<i>(Rock Lee)</i>
<i>It is finally starting! The 2nd</i>
<i>round of the Chunin Exams!</i>

292
00:21:14,405 --> 00:21:18,881
{\an5}<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>We don't know what lies ahead. </i>
<i>So make sure that you stay on</i>
<i>your toes.</i>

293
00:21:18,914 --> 00:21:21,184
{\an1}<i>(Tenten)     (Lee)</i>
<i>Right!       Okay!</i>

294
00:22:58,194 --> 00:23:02,536
<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>Our priority is to acquire </i>
<i>the other scroll quickly.</i>

295
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:05,175
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>To do that, we'll have</i>
<i>to battle another team.</i>

296
00:23:05,207 --> 00:23:09,549
{\an5}<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>Yesterday's brawl in the </i>
<i>cafeteria was a fortunate turn</i>
<i>of events.</i>

297
00:23:09,582 --> 00:23:16,595
{\an1}<i>In my opinion,...the teams to </i>
<i>watch are the one with Shira,</i>
<i>who stopped Lee's kick. And...</i>

298
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:21,504
<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden: </i>
<i>"Demon Desert Survival."</i>

299
00:23:21,537 --> 00:23:24,242
<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>...the team from the</i>
<i>Hidden Waterfall!</i>
