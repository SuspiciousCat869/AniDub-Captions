-Right this way.

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,065
-Wow.

4
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:20,140
Is this place for real?

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,442
-Careful.

6
00:00:21,476 --> 00:00:22,411
You OK?

7
00:00:22,444 --> 00:00:23,313
-Yeah.

8
00:00:23,346 --> 00:00:24,148
Thanks, buddy.

9

Why you.

-All right.

13
00:00:38,142 --> 00:00:39,277
That's enough.

-Any progress?

00:01:11,408 --> 00:01:14,114
-Sir, we've already sent
monks to the remaining three

hidden tombs, those of Lord
Nauma, Lord Tou'u, and Lord

Seito.

28
00:01:20,693 --> 00:01:22,530
We've sent some of our
finest men, my lord.

29
00:01:22,563 --> 00:01:26,605
They'll inform us immediately
if anything happens.

30
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:28,442
MONK: We've also
instructed several men

31
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:31,213
to search for the
remains of Lord Kitane,

32

and temple security has
been tightened just in case.

00:01:34,654 --> 00:01:37,560
-Well, I suppose we
can rest easy then.

SORA: Took you all long enough.

CHIRIKU: Sora.

-Boy, nice attitude.

-Hello.

42
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:13,898
I'm Captain Yamato, and with
me are Sai, Sakura, and Naruto.

-Leaf ninja.

44
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,106
Well, that is reassuring.

45
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:18,775
-Yep.

46
00:02:18,775 --> 00:02:20,210
We'll take care of this for you.

-We're ready to move
whenever you are.

So please just give us the word.

-Thank you.

00:02:27,525 --> 00:02:30,765
But we're waiting to hear
from our monks in the field.

[theme music]

-The bodies they stole, why
did they even want them?

54
00:04:34,543 --> 00:04:35,912
-Hard to say.

55
00:04:35,945 --> 00:04:38,851
It could be that they want the
information inside of them.

56
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:39,653
Or maybe.

57
00:04:43,528 --> 00:04:48,036
-Summoning Jutsu Reanimation
First and Second.

58
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:55,484
So the third one failed, did it?

59
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:57,455
Oh well, no matter.

60
00:05:00,862 --> 00:05:04,302
-Maybe what they want is to
use the bodies in the same way

61
00:05:04,335 --> 00:05:07,341
Orochimaru did.

62
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,979
But a jutsu like that
takes great power,

63
00:05:10,012 --> 00:05:13,453
and I doubt that's what
we're dealing with here.

64
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:14,789
-Wow.

65
00:05:14,822 --> 00:05:17,895
So then the four shinobi from
those hidden tombs or whatever,

66
00:05:17,928 --> 00:05:21,903
they must have really
been something, huh.

67
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:24,475
Hey, what gives?

68
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:26,646
-They were like no other.

69
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:31,489
But most of all, they
were good people.

70
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:37,000
The tombs of Nauma, Seito, Tou'u
, and Kitane lie to the east,

71

west, north, and south of here
with the Fire Temple resting

72
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,778
squarely in the middle.

73
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:47,855
They were each members of
the Guardian Shinobi 12.

74
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:48,957
-Guardian Shinobi, huh?

75
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,894
-I've heard of them before.

76
00:05:50,894 --> 00:05:51,963
-I know the name.

77
00:05:51,996 --> 00:05:54,501
-Are they famous or something?

78
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:56,772
-Well, the people in the
know are aware of them.

[groan]

80

-The Guardian Shinobi,
the 12 are an elite group

81
00:06:01,715 --> 00:06:04,721
from all across the Land of Fire
who protect its feudal lord.

82
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:06,023
-Huh.

83
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:09,029
But protecting the Land of Fire
is what the shinobi of the Leaf

84
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,998
are for.

85
00:06:10,031 --> 00:06:10,933
-That's true.

86
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:13,872
We do watch over
the Land the Fire.

87
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,710
That is our purpose.

88
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:17,513
The Leaf Village
exists to safeguard

89
00:06:17,547 --> 00:06:20,920
the whole of the nation,
not just a single man.

90
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,522
-So you're saying--

91
00:06:22,522 --> 00:06:24,560
-To protect the
entire country, one

92
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:27,800
must protect the man
who stands at its head.

93
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:30,572
And that's precisely
what the Guardian Shinobi

94
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:32,509
12 were assembled to do.

95
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:38,087
I was a much younger
man at the time,

96
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:42,496
but even then, I was willing
to put my life on the line.

97
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:45,502
I joined the 12
without any hesitation.

98
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:46,036
-Wait.

99
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,406
You mean you were--

100
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,445
-Well, I used to be.

101
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:52,883
-Just so you two
know, Asuma Sensei

102
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,553
used to be a member as well.

103
00:06:54,553 --> 00:06:56,056
-Ah.

104
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,926
-Asuma.

105
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,830
He's doing well, I hope.

106
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,732
-Yeah.

107
00:07:00,765 --> 00:07:02,068
He's fantastic.

108
00:07:02,101 --> 00:07:06,844
He gave me some awesome training
advice just the other day.

109
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:09,048
-That's good to hear.

110
00:07:09,082 --> 00:07:13,190
-So that would mean
these hidden tombs that

111
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:17,833
were broken into, for
you and for Asuma Sensei,

112
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:19,102
it's personal.

113
00:07:19,135 --> 00:07:20,671
Your friends'
graves were defiled.

114
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,622
-All four of them
died when young,

115
00:07:29,655 --> 00:07:31,793
giving their lives
for the Land of Fire.

116
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:52,468
Within the 12, a
faction began to emerge

117
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:54,572
that sought to stage a coup.

118
00:07:54,605 --> 00:07:58,747
It ultimately splintered
the shinobi apart.

119
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,786
-A coup d'etat, an attempt
to seize power and bend

120
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,725
a nation's will closer
to one's own ideals

121
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,765
through any means
deemed necessary.

122
00:08:07,765 --> 00:08:09,902
-Yeah, I knew that already.

123
00:08:09,902 --> 00:08:11,973
-Extremists, all of them.

124
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:13,809
Their desire to
protect this land

125
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:16,782
became so all-consuming
to some within the 12

126
00:08:16,782 --> 00:08:20,223
that a radical new
ideology began to form.

127
00:08:20,256 --> 00:08:21,225
-Gotcha.

128
00:08:21,258 --> 00:08:22,660
So you're saying--

129
00:08:22,694 --> 00:08:25,500
-They just couldn't leave
the Land of Fire's well-being

130
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,506
in the more lenient hands
of the Hidden Leaf Village,

131
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:31,210
better in their minds to
create a new military order

132
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,651
with themselves at the center,
or something to that effect.

133
00:08:34,651 --> 00:08:36,522
-Yeah, or something like that.

134
00:08:36,555 --> 00:08:38,659
-Unforgivable.

135
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:41,063
-Naruto, keep quiet.

136
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:46,608
-You're correct.

137
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:49,580
They meant to dissolve
the Leaf and consolidate

138
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:53,221
all military force under the
command of the feudal lord.

139
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:55,091
They had laid the
groundwork for it.

140
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,663
All they needed
was his blessing,

141
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,201
all the while
making preparations

142
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:02,205
to invade our neighbors.

143
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:05,645
-What did you say?

144
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,184
-They had no interest in
maintaining the balance

145
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:10,221
among the five great nations.

146
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:13,695
They thought peace was
only attainable by uniting

147
00:09:13,695 --> 00:09:16,934
the entire world under
the Land of Fire's banner.

148
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:19,573
-That's so selfish.

149
00:09:19,573 --> 00:09:23,715
-No matter how many ballads are
written about it, war is war.

150
00:09:23,715 --> 00:09:27,254
As expected, his lordship
became aware of their plotting.

151
00:09:27,254 --> 00:09:28,715
And then--

152
00:09:48,616 --> 00:09:51,803
the six who staged
the coup were eliminated.

153
00:09:51,836 --> 00:09:56,946
However, that day, Kitane,
Tou'u, Seito, and Nauma,

154
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,917
they too fell in battle.

155
00:10:02,258 --> 00:10:06,766
-How could something
like that have happened?

156
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,303
SAI: The people from
those tombs were

157
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:11,776
Chiriku's and Asuma
Sensei's friends.

158
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,183
Just think if it were
Sasuke, how you'd feel.

159
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:17,253
It would be like if
you two had lost him

160
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:18,590
and his body was stolen.

161
00:10:24,267 --> 00:10:26,171
That's true, isn't it?

162
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:29,678
-We cannot allow the people who
took Kitane's body to get away

163
00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:31,782
with it.

164
00:10:31,782 --> 00:10:32,650
-Yeah.

165
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,352
You have our word.

166
00:10:39,898 --> 00:10:42,237
It's time for the younger
monks' evening training.

167
00:11:00,338 --> 00:11:03,077
-There's that little jerk again.

168
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:04,213
-Free sparring.

169
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:04,815
Begin.

170
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,362
-Hm.

171
00:11:12,396 --> 00:11:13,198
-What is it?

172
00:11:27,926 --> 00:11:29,830
-Something's off about him?

173
00:11:29,864 --> 00:11:31,334
-What's the matter with you?

174
00:11:36,277 --> 00:11:38,248
-I can't stand him.

175
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:47,064
-Bow.

176
00:11:47,098 --> 00:11:48,133
-Thank you very much.

177
00:11:51,874 --> 00:11:53,143
You again.

178
00:11:53,143 --> 00:11:54,780
-So how about it?

179
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:56,751
Am I doing it right or what?

180
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:57,285
-Beat it.

181
00:11:57,318 --> 00:11:58,153
Will you?

182
00:11:58,186 --> 00:11:59,857
Don't waste my time.

183
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,859
-Please.

184
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:02,428
You're the only one
who's wasting time.

185
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:04,900
I don't know what passes
for training around here,

186
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:07,405
but it looked like
dancing to me.

187
00:12:07,438 --> 00:12:08,440
-Oh yeah.

188
00:12:08,473 --> 00:12:11,212
NARUTO: You really tick me off.

189
00:12:11,246 --> 00:12:13,850
It's all just a joke to you.

190
00:12:13,884 --> 00:12:18,060
And I don't really know why, but
it's starting to make me mad.

191
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:19,896
-Naruto.

192
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:20,698
That idiot.

193
00:12:24,772 --> 00:12:27,912
-Your name's Naruto, isn't it?

194
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:29,147
-Yeah.

195
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,488
-Let me give you an even
better one for the after-life,

196
00:12:32,722 --> 00:12:35,828
something for the world
to remember you by.

197
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:37,030
-Remember?

198
00:12:37,063 --> 00:12:38,032
-Naruto, look out.

199
00:12:59,274 --> 00:13:00,476
-Finally getting serious, huh?

200
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,288
That's the kind of
strength you showed me

201
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:07,457
the first time we went at it.

202
00:13:15,473 --> 00:13:20,248
-Now, you're really
starting to tick me off.

203
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:22,387
-Hey, take it easy, will you?

204
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,456
We're just sparring here.

205
00:13:23,489 --> 00:13:24,991
Quit freaking out on me.

206
00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:41,457
-Not again.

207
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:55,017
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
What's with this guy?

208
00:13:58,023 --> 00:13:59,994
His power's lost
all sense of focus.

209
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,813
They're all staring at him.

210
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:28,250
Those eyes.

211
00:14:32,158 --> 00:14:34,095
That's how they
used to look at me.

212
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:45,584
-Sora, that's enough.

213
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,853
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Oh no.

214
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,622
I can't stop.

215
00:14:58,644 --> 00:15:01,516
-Oh well, no new name for you.

216
00:15:35,883 --> 00:15:37,587
-What are you doing?

217
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,460
-I just thought
I'd wipe your brow.

218
00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:43,966
-Thanks, but no thanks.

219
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:45,603
Hey, Sai.

220
00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:46,905
-Yeah.

221
00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:49,644
-What's a name
for the afterlife?

222
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:52,684
-Well, it's one you're
given after you're gone.

223
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:56,124
You know for people
to remember you by.

224
00:15:56,124 --> 00:15:56,959
-Oh, I get it.

225
00:15:56,992 --> 00:15:58,662
Kinda like a nickname, huh?

226
00:15:58,696 --> 00:15:59,530
-Uh.

227
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,665
-So it's a sign of friendship.

228
00:16:05,642 --> 00:16:07,613
-Sora.

229
00:16:07,646 --> 00:16:08,214
Hey.

230
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:14,193
Huh?

231
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:24,580
-What's the matter?

232
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:30,659
MONK #2: Lord Nauma's tomb.

233
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,439
[grunt]

234
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,069
-Beast Wave Palm.

235
00:17:17,718 --> 00:17:19,121
Best Wave Gale Palm.

236
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:36,790
NARUTO: Man, nice jutsu.

237
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,261
Are you working on changing
the form of your wind chakra

238
00:17:39,294 --> 00:17:41,532
too then?

239
00:17:41,565 --> 00:17:43,402
-What are you doing here?

240
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:44,504
-Huh.

241
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:45,673
Oh, right.

242
00:17:45,707 --> 00:17:48,312
Thought you'd need a name
for the afterlife too.

243
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:50,516
How about it?

244
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,585
-All right.

245
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:53,021
Fine.

246
00:17:53,054 --> 00:17:55,760
Just make sure you
give me a good one.

247
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,629
-Let's see.

248
00:17:56,662 --> 00:17:58,366
What could we call you?

249
00:17:58,399 --> 00:17:59,234
Sora the--

250
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:00,035
-You idiot.

251
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:01,772
Give it a rest already.

252
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:15,132
-What was all that
back in the temple?

253
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:16,401
-Seriously.

254
00:18:16,434 --> 00:18:19,273
Are you always such a pain?

255
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,375
-Maybe.

256
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:22,413
I suppose people have
thought that about me

257
00:18:22,446 --> 00:18:25,552
as long as I can remember.

258
00:18:25,585 --> 00:18:28,291
It's the same with you, right?

259
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:35,238
-So what?

260
00:18:35,272 --> 00:18:37,176
What difference
does it make anyway?

261
00:18:39,647 --> 00:18:40,549
Sure.

262
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:42,486
People think I'm
a pain, but they

263
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:43,688
can judge me all they want.

264
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:44,790
I don't care.

265
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:47,095
None of that even matters,
because the person

266
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:50,836
who hates me most of all is me.

267
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:51,504
Yeah.

268
00:18:51,537 --> 00:18:53,675
That's right.

269
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:58,150
My power has never been
anything but a nuisance.

270
00:18:58,183 --> 00:19:01,123
-Sora.

271
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:04,730
-Anyway, nuisance or not, I
can't throw that power away.

272
00:19:08,437 --> 00:19:14,315
I still need it to avenge
my father's murder.

273
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:14,784
-Revenge, huh?

274
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,865
-A patrol bird.

275
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:23,634
One of the tombs.

276
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:30,281
-Naruto, where have you been?

277
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:31,550
-Sorry.

278
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,453
-They've gotten word from
one of the shinobi monks sent

279
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:36,293
to Lord Nauma's resting place.

280
00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:37,461
His body's gone.

281
00:19:37,495 --> 00:19:40,501
The tomb is in shambles,
just like the rest of them.

282
00:19:40,534 --> 00:19:43,172
-Are you kidding?

283
00:19:43,206 --> 00:19:45,376
-At this rate, the
others will be.

284
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,680
-My team is ready.

285
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:49,151
We should go now.

286
00:19:49,184 --> 00:19:50,386
-I'm coming too.

287
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,422
-All right.

288
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:52,658
-OK then.

289
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,762
I hope those grave
robbers are ready.

290
00:19:54,796 --> 00:19:56,867
They're going to get the
pounding of their lives.

291
00:20:29,898 --> 00:20:32,570
[theme music]

292
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:01,780
-We've heard from
the Fire Temple.

293
00:22:01,813 --> 00:22:04,953
The last of the hidden tombs
has been compromised, my lady.

294
00:22:04,986 --> 00:22:05,855
-They've got us.

295
00:22:05,888 --> 00:22:07,390
So what's our status now?

296
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,927
-Team Kakashi's on route.

297
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:10,965
TSUNADE: So it's true then.

298
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:13,737
They were after the bodies
of the Guardian Shinobi 12,

299
00:22:13,737 --> 00:22:15,073
weren't they?

300
00:22:15,073 --> 00:22:17,553
SHIZUNE: Between
Orochimaru, the Akatsuki,

301
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:20,223
and Lord Danzo and
all his machinations.

302
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,324
TSUNADE: I know.

303
00:22:21,357 --> 00:22:25,294
So why not start with
the one closest to home?

304
00:22:25,328 --> 00:22:27,864
NARUTO: Next time,
"A New Enemy."
