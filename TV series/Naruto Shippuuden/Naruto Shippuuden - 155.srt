1
00:00:09,784 --> 00:00:11,619
-To die?

2
00:00:11,652 --> 00:00:16,160
{\an1}But how does dying mean
becoming one with nature?

3
00:00:16,193 --> 00:00:17,227
-Gamakichi.

4
00:00:17,261 --> 00:00:19,364
{\an1}What's with telling him to die?

5
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:21,766
{\an1}Don't make such weird analogies.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,104
-Yeah, but--

7
00:00:24,137 --> 00:00:25,906
{\an1}-Now, now, just relax.

8
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:28,643
{\an1}You're not actually
going to die, Naruto boy.

9
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:30,513
-So what, then?

10
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:33,716
{\an1}-Just wait and listen all
the way until the end.

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,586
{\an1}I'll explain it step by step.

12
00:00:38,356 --> 00:00:41,227
{\an1}To become able to
absorb nature energy

13
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,164
{\an1}means gaining the abilities
to sense it around you,

14
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:48,737
{\an1}to draw it to you, and
to pull it into yourself.

15
00:00:48,771 --> 00:00:52,243
{\an1}In addition, by learning how
to become one with nature,

16
00:00:52,276 --> 00:00:55,646
{\an1}you also gain full
control over nature energy

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,618
{\an1}entering and leaving your body.

18
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:01,055
{\an1}Practically speaking,
what this means

19
00:01:01,088 --> 00:01:02,324
{\an1}in terms of your training--

20
00:01:02,357 --> 00:01:03,258
-Yeah?

21
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:04,659
Yeah?

22
00:01:04,693 --> 00:01:05,995
-You don't move.

23
00:01:06,028 --> 00:01:07,096
-OK?

24
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,766
{\an1}-I mean that you must
learn to sit still.

25
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,538
{\an1}Animals like us can only
appreciate and learn

26
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:15,774
{\an1}nature energy when we
stop all our own movements

27
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:19,548
{\an1}and synchronize ourselves
with the flow of nature.

28
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:22,718
-So, basically I
have to be still.

29
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:24,687
{\an1}Isn't that a little
bit too easy?

30
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:25,889
-Naruto.

31
00:01:25,922 --> 00:01:28,226
{\an1}You really don't get
it at all, do ya?

32
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,596
-Hmph.

33
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,337
{\an1}The hardest thing for animals
to do is to be absolutely still.

34
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:38,307
{\an1}-Doing stuff like
jumping, running,

35
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,442
and working to
manipulate my chakra?

36
00:01:40,477 --> 00:01:42,679
{\an1}I've done all kinds
of training like that.

37
00:01:42,712 --> 00:01:44,014
But not moving?

38
00:01:44,047 --> 00:01:46,652
{\an1}I've never really had a reason
to do much of that before.

39
00:01:46,684 --> 00:01:48,921
{\an1}But if that's how you
take in nature energy,

40
00:01:48,954 --> 00:01:51,525
{\an1}then that's exactly
what I'll do.

41
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:53,894
{\an1}-It's impossible to
do it right away.

42
00:01:53,928 --> 00:01:56,831
{\an1}This training is going
to take some time.

43
00:01:56,865 --> 00:01:58,901
{\an1}It's pretty high level
stuff that you're doing.

44
00:01:58,935 --> 00:02:01,539
{\an1}-Then let's stop talking,
and do this already.

45
00:02:01,573 --> 00:02:03,975
{\an1}-You must not take this lightly.

46
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:07,112
{\an1}Our enemy is Pain, who possesses
the Rinnegan, the power

47
00:02:07,146 --> 00:02:09,049
{\an1}of the Sage of the Six Paths.

48
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:12,454
{\an1}Powerful enough to
kill Jiraiya boy.

49
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:15,858
{\an1}And with that attitude, you
can't possibly defeat him.

50
00:02:15,892 --> 00:02:18,562
{\an1}-Trust me, I know all about him.

51
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,499
{\an1}He leads the Akatsuki, and
they're after tailed beasts.

52
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:23,836
{\an1}Those guys could come
for me at any moment,

53
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:25,939
{\an1}so I just don't have
any time to waste.

54
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:32,781
{\an1}-Well, I guess it's
just lucky for you

55
00:02:32,815 --> 00:02:34,384
{\an1}that there's a better way.

56
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:35,553
A shortcut.

57
00:02:35,586 --> 00:02:36,187
-There is?

58
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,054
Really?

59
00:02:37,088 --> 00:02:38,323
Then teach it to
me, Geezer Toad.

60
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:43,062
{\an1}-This waterfall behind me.

61
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,798
{\an1}It's the secret toad oil of Mt.

62
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,301
Myoboku.

63
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:47,502
{\an1}-What's it used for?

64
00:02:50,273 --> 00:02:52,242
-Come here, and
hold out your hand.

65
00:03:00,655 --> 00:03:01,121
-Here.

66
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:06,795
{\an1}-This is far more than
just ordinary oil.

67
00:03:06,828 --> 00:03:09,832
{\an1}It has the property of
attracting nature energy.

68
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:12,504
{\an1}This stuff will hope
advance your training.

69
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:13,305
-Whoa.

70
00:03:13,338 --> 00:03:15,074
{\an1}Now, that's useful.

71
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:18,680
{\an1}-Now, wherever you rub
this oil onto your body,

72
00:03:18,713 --> 00:03:22,817
{\an1}nature energy will be able
to enter through that spot.

73
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,221
{\an1}And then gradually, as
you learn to feel it,

74
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:28,125
{\an1}you will gain the ability
to sense nature energy.

75
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,528
{\an1}-Yeah, you're right.

76
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:32,230
{\an1}I think I can feel
something through my skin.

77
00:03:32,264 --> 00:03:33,734
{\an1}-Since you're just
beginning, this

78
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:37,071
{\an1}is a tool to help you
grasp the concept.

79
00:03:37,104 --> 00:03:40,309
{\an1}In time, will won't need to use
the oil at all to sense nature

80
00:03:40,343 --> 00:03:41,477
energy.

81
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,613
{\an1}However, there is a risk.

82
00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:51,524
{\an1}If a neophyte who cannot
control nature energy uses it,

83
00:03:51,558 --> 00:03:54,362
{\an1}they start transforming
into a frog.

84
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:02,339
[scream]

85
00:04:02,373 --> 00:04:04,609
-What the-- what
the hell is this?

86
00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:06,612
[scream] Help!

87
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:07,681
{\an1}I don't want to be a frog!

88
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:13,422
What's that for?

89
00:04:16,225 --> 00:04:18,562
{\an1}I-- I'm back to normal.

90
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:20,464
{\an1}FUKASAKU: It's all
about balanced.

91
00:04:20,498 --> 00:04:23,034
{\an1}You're used to turning your
mental and physical energy

92
00:04:23,068 --> 00:04:25,405
{\an1}into ninjutsu chakra,
so you've already

93
00:04:25,438 --> 00:04:28,008
{\an1}got a balance when
it comes to that.

94
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,212
{\an1}But now you must add
nature energy into the mix,

95
00:04:31,246 --> 00:04:34,183
{\an1}and finding that balance
is extremely difficult.

96
00:04:34,216 --> 00:04:36,386
{\an1}-It's about balance, huh?

97
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,024
{\an1}-You take in too little, and
you won't get Sage Jutsu chakra.

98
00:04:40,057 --> 00:04:42,562
{\an1}And yet if you take in
too much, nature energy

99
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:47,234
{\an1}will overwhelm you and
turn you into a frog.

100
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:49,705
{\an1}Of course, if you only
take in a little too much,

101
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:52,409
{\an1}the transformation's reversible.

102
00:04:52,443 --> 00:04:54,478
But get beyond a
certain amount of it,

103
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,916
{\an1}and you'll never revert
back to human again.

104
00:04:56,948 --> 00:05:00,152
{\an1}You'll be trapped, forced to
remain a frog forever and ever,

105
00:05:00,186 --> 00:05:02,389
Naruto boy.

106
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:05,293
{\an1}-What I meant about
you dying is that you

107
00:05:05,326 --> 00:05:07,496
might stop being
a human entirely.

108
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,299
{\an1}-And once you turn
into a frog, you

109
00:05:09,332 --> 00:05:10,935
progress further
toward permanently

110
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:12,904
{\an1}being one with nature.

111
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,942
{\an1}The students who attempted
this training in the past

112
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:21,483
{\an1}but were unsuccessful turned
into those stone statues.

113
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:22,918
-Huh?

114
00:05:22,952 --> 00:05:25,221
All of 'em?

115
00:05:25,254 --> 00:05:28,926
{\an1}-Well, don't fret too much.

116
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,863
{\an1}I'll be right by your side.

117
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:33,867
{\an1}And this baton is a tool
that can beat nature's energy

118
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,836
{\an1}right out of your body.

119
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,307
{\an1}So if I see you start to
transform into a frog,

120
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:41,544
{\an1}why, then I simply
beat you thoroughly

121
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:44,648
{\an1}to reverse the process.

122
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:46,784
{\an1}I gotta be honest with you.

123
00:05:46,818 --> 00:05:51,858
{\an1}Even Jiraiya boy wasn't able to
completely master this ability.

124
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:54,962
{\an1}When he manipulated
Sage Jutsu chakra,

125
00:05:54,996 --> 00:05:58,500
{\an1}Jiraiya boy always acquired
some frog features.

126
00:05:58,534 --> 00:06:01,005
{\an1}And he was one of
the best at it.

127
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:04,809
{\an1}I highly doubt that you'd
hesitate after coming this far,

128
00:06:04,843 --> 00:06:08,882
{\an1}but I still gotta
ask, what will you do?

129
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:13,923
-I'll do it.

130
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:20,363
{\an1}My ninja way is the
same as Pervy Sage's.

131
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:24,369
[theme music]

132
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:06,578
{\an1}-Six Tails is finally ours.

133
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:10,683
{\an1}Now we can go on the
hunt for the Nine Tails.

134
00:08:10,717 --> 00:08:12,619
{\an1}-Yes, that's a good idea.

135
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:14,221
{\an1}Because you killed
Jiraiya, the Leaf

136
00:08:14,254 --> 00:08:16,759
{\an1}will set their sights on you.

137
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:19,796
The more time to
assess, the more likely

138
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,966
they'll have a
plan set in motion.

139
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:25,471
{\an1}We should take action before
it becomes more difficult.

140
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:28,475
{\an1}-Pain is invincible, so
no matter what happens,

141
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,213
{\an1}or what they plan, we will
capture the Nine Tails.

142
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:33,648
{\an1}Just one more Tailed
Beast remains.

143
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:35,318
-Not two?

144
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:38,223
{\an1}-Sasuke has already
captured the Eight Tails.

145
00:08:38,255 --> 00:08:38,756
-I see.

146
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,296
-Konan, make all
the preparations.

147
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,043
{\an1}We leave now for the
Hidden Leaf Village.

148
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:05,226
-Gah!

149
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,328
I'm gonna be all
bruised on the outside,

150
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:09,232
{\an1}and bleeding on the inside.

151
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:09,933
-What?

152
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,937
{\an1}You're quitting already?

153
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,841
{\an1}-Hey, you know, I have a
much better training method

154
00:09:15,874 --> 00:09:17,142
{\an1}that we can try out.

155
00:09:17,177 --> 00:09:18,544
{\an1}-Ah, what's that?

156
00:09:18,577 --> 00:09:21,148
{\an1}-I could do this training
with shadow clones as well.

157
00:09:21,182 --> 00:09:23,218
{\an1}They'll exponentially
increase my progress

158
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:24,553
{\an1}in learning all this.

159
00:09:24,586 --> 00:09:26,055
{\an1}-You do have a point.

160
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:29,059
{\an1}All of the experiences
that the shadow clones have

161
00:09:29,092 --> 00:09:31,562
{\an1}would revert back
to the original.

162
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:35,167
{\an1}But remember, if even a single
one of the shadow clones

163
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:38,072
{\an1}completely changes into
a frog during this,

164
00:09:38,105 --> 00:09:40,041
{\an1}it's all over for
you, Naruto boy.

165
00:09:40,074 --> 00:09:40,741
-Yeah.

166
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:42,477
{\an1}I already know all that.

167
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:43,545
-Very well.

168
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:45,081
{\an1}But four is the limit.

169
00:09:45,114 --> 00:09:47,885
{\an1}Anymore, and neither the
baton nor I can keep up.

170
00:09:47,918 --> 00:09:50,956
-All right!

171
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:52,357
[smack] Ow!

172
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,793
{\an1}[smack] [smack] Oh!

173
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:01,938
{\an1}-This isn't a game of
whack a mole, you know?

174
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:04,007
{\an1}You're supposed to be training.

175
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,677
{\an1}I don't know how much
longer I can keep this up.

176
00:10:06,711 --> 00:10:07,946
{\an1}-Boy, that stings.

177
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,847
-Eh?

178
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:11,017
[scream]

179
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:14,521
{\an1}-My face is puffed up
from all your beatings,

180
00:10:14,555 --> 00:10:16,591
not 'cause I'm
turning into a frog!

181
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,260
Come on!

182
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:17,960
-Wha?

183
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:18,460
Oh.

184
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:18,961
Sorry.

185
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:24,869
{\an1}-Never in a million
years would I

186
00:10:24,903 --> 00:10:27,140
{\an1}have guessed that trying
to sense nature energy

187
00:10:27,173 --> 00:10:29,976
{\an1}was going to be as
difficult as this.

188
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,180
-Remember, only
through perseverance

189
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,182
{\an1}shall true strength be gained.

190
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,219
-Yeah, you don't
have to tell me that.

191
00:10:36,252 --> 00:10:38,856
{\an1}If it'll make me as
strong as Pervy Sage was,

192
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,926
{\an1}then I'll put up with
whatever I have to.

193
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,060
-You're wrong.

194
00:10:42,093 --> 00:10:43,662
{\an1}That's impossible.

195
00:10:43,695 --> 00:10:44,697
-Huh?

196
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,134
{\an1}-Sage Jutsu is not
meant for everybody.

197
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,836
{\an1}Not by a long shot.

198
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,738
{\an1}You could say it's
possible because it's

199
00:10:50,772 --> 00:10:52,308
{\an1}you and Jiraiya boy.

200
00:10:52,341 --> 00:10:55,912
{\an1}Because otherwise, I wouldn't
have brought you here

201
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,381
{\an1}in the first place.

202
00:10:57,415 --> 00:11:00,052
{\an1}-Sometimes you don't
make sense at all.

203
00:11:00,085 --> 00:11:03,022
{\an1}-Well, unless you already
possess enormous chakra inside

204
00:11:03,056 --> 00:11:05,793
{\an1}of you, then nature
energy would simply

205
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:09,131
{\an1}take over and transform
you immediately.

206
00:11:09,165 --> 00:11:12,936
{\an1}That is how intense and
incredible nature energy is.

207
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,538
-Whoa.

208
00:11:14,571 --> 00:11:19,578
{\an1}-But also, you must possess
the guts to never give up.

209
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:24,453
{\an1}That is the kind of person
who can become a sage.

210
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:25,220
-All right!

211
00:11:25,253 --> 00:11:27,457
{\an1}Let's do this, then!

212
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:28,124
-Fool!

213
00:11:28,157 --> 00:11:31,195
{\an1}Do you want to die?

214
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:32,496
[smacking]

215
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:34,499
[shouting]

216
00:11:34,532 --> 00:11:36,502
[smacking]

217
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:38,972
[shouting]

218
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:56,797
-I can see it!

219
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,432
Yeah!

220
00:11:57,465 --> 00:11:58,266
All right!

221
00:11:58,299 --> 00:11:59,267
{\an1}FUKASAKU (VOICEOVER): Excellent.

222
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,902
{\an1}It seems he's finally
starting to be

223
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:03,407
{\an1}able to sense nature energy.

224
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,011
{\an1}-Lord Fukasaku, I'm beginning
to get a little bit peckish.

225
00:12:07,045 --> 00:12:08,646
-Yes, me too.

226
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,716
{\an1}Naruto boy, it's time
for us to take a break,

227
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:12,318
{\an1}so let's go ahead
and grab some lunch.

228
00:12:16,858 --> 00:12:17,859
Eat up, boy.

229
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:19,295
{\an1}After this break,
I'll have you try

230
00:12:19,328 --> 00:12:22,866
{\an1}to lift up a stone
frog using Sage Jutsu.

231
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,903
-Uh, yeah.

232
00:12:24,936 --> 00:12:26,972
{\an1}-That's some tasty
food, isn't it?

233
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:29,041
They're all Ma's
most special dishes.

234
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:30,010
{\an1}-These are delicious.

235
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:32,980
{\an1}They're my favorites.

236
00:12:33,014 --> 00:12:37,120
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): That
actually did taste good.

237
00:12:37,153 --> 00:12:39,557
{\an1}I'm becoming less
human, after all.

238
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:43,995
{\an1}-Now then, I want you to try
to lift one of the stone frogs.

239
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,132
{\an1}But first, why don't
you try lifting one

240
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,735
{\an1}using only your ninjutsu chakra?

241
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:49,236
-OK.

242
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:54,743
All right.

243
00:12:58,783 --> 00:13:00,953
I can't lift it!

244
00:13:00,986 --> 00:13:03,523
-That's enough.

245
00:13:03,556 --> 00:13:09,731
{\an1}God Now mix in some
Sage Jutsu chakra.

246
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:10,233
-OK.

247
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:35,800
-Good.

248
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:37,770
{\an1}Now try lifting the frog again.

249
00:14:00,702 --> 00:14:01,736
{\an1}That's it, Naruto boy!

250
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,717
{\an1}-Nicely done there, Naruto.

251
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,587
{\an1}FUKASAKU (VOICEOVER):
This lad's even quicker

252
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,523
{\an1}on the uptake than Jiraiya boy.

253
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:17,124
-I did it!

254
00:14:17,158 --> 00:14:18,060
-You idiot!

255
00:14:18,093 --> 00:14:19,261
{\an1}How dare you treat
your predecessor

256
00:14:19,294 --> 00:14:20,128
{\an1}with such disrespect.

257
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,835
-Oh, no!

258
00:14:24,868 --> 00:14:26,204
{\an1}FUKASAKU (VOICEOVER):
Though he's

259
00:14:26,238 --> 00:14:29,543
{\an1}a lot denser than
Jiraiya boy, too.

260
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:31,011
{\an1}-All right, Naruto boy.

261
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:34,215
{\an1}Pick up all the toppled stones
and put them back in place.

262
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:35,451
-Aw, come on!

263
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:49,870
{\an1}-Ah, the Eight Tails.

264
00:14:49,903 --> 00:14:54,042
{\an1}It seems Sasuke was
successful after all.

265
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:56,045
{\an1}-Pain is collecting
the Nine Tails.

266
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,918
{\an1}FUKASAKU: It appears
that you have

267
00:15:00,952 --> 00:15:04,491
{\an1}mastered toad oil
assisted control.

268
00:15:04,524 --> 00:15:07,328
{\an1}Now you need to master
controlling nature energy

269
00:15:07,361 --> 00:15:09,298
{\an1}without using any
toad oil whatsoever.

270
00:15:13,836 --> 00:15:17,542
{\an1}-I can feel the power
flowing into me!

271
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:20,980
{\an1}-Ninjutsu chakra consumes
your internal energy,

272
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:25,486
{\an1}so the more you use it, the
more exhausted you will become.

273
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,922
{\an1}With Sage Jutsu chakra,
you're continuously

274
00:15:27,955 --> 00:15:31,662
{\an1}drawing more energy into
you from the outside.

275
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:35,900
{\an1}You won't tire, and you'll
recover and heal quicker, too.

276
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:37,269
-No way.

277
00:15:37,302 --> 00:15:39,439
{\an1}FUKASAKU (VOICEOVER): And
with the Nine Tails chakra

278
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:44,212
{\an1}in the mix, he's showing a
truly remarkable recovery rate.

279
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:47,818
{\an1}-I wonder, now, maybe
I can do that, too?

280
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,552
-Do what?

281
00:15:48,585 --> 00:15:49,319
-Huh?

282
00:15:49,353 --> 00:15:50,854
{\an1}Oh, uh, it's, uh, nothing.

283
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:51,923
Nothing at all.

284
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:53,659
{\an1}-Never mind, then.

285
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:55,961
But here.

286
00:15:55,994 --> 00:15:59,600
{\an1}I thought I'd give you this
little gift today, Naruto boy.

287
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:00,134
-Huh?

288
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,603
What's that?

289
00:16:01,636 --> 00:16:02,270
-A book.

290
00:16:02,304 --> 00:16:03,473
-Yeah?

291
00:16:03,506 --> 00:16:06,175
{\an1}-This is the very first
novel that Jiraiya boy ever

292
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:08,312
{\an1}set down on paper.

293
00:16:08,345 --> 00:16:10,683
{\an1}And a lot of Jiraiya boy's
thoughts and feelings

294
00:16:10,716 --> 00:16:12,351
{\an1}are contained within it.

295
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:13,720
{\an1}You ought to read it.

296
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:21,964
{\an1}-Tales of a Gutsy Ninja.

297
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,606
{\an1}-You ready to give up yet?

298
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:36,451
{\an1}I'm really starting to tire
of our little game of tag.

299
00:16:49,904 --> 00:16:51,372
Just give up.

300
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:53,575
{\an1}-I just have one thing to say.

301
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:56,078
{\an1}-I don't care what you say!

302
00:16:56,112 --> 00:16:58,282
{\an1}Just die, already.

303
00:16:58,315 --> 00:16:59,717
-Give up, huh?

304
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:02,020
-Huh?

305
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:03,255
{\an1}-Yeah, about that.

306
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:10,532
{\an1}-Even if you take me
down, another assassin

307
00:17:10,566 --> 00:17:13,035
{\an1}will just take my place.

308
00:17:13,068 --> 00:17:18,477
{\an1}[laughter] As long as we're
cursed to live in this ninja

309
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,514
{\an1}world, then there
can be no peace.

310
00:17:21,547 --> 00:17:23,851
Ever.

311
00:17:23,884 --> 00:17:28,156
{\an1}-Well, I'm going to
break that curse one day.

312
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:30,493
If there's truly
piece in this world,

313
00:17:30,526 --> 00:17:32,696
{\an1}then I am going to find it.

314
00:17:32,729 --> 00:17:36,100
{\an1}I will never stop looking.

315
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:40,273
{\an1}-Who-- who are you?

316
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:41,407
-My name is--

317
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:05,942
{\an1}-Sasuke said he was gonna
sever his bond with me,

318
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:07,811
{\an1}and become stronger.

319
00:18:07,845 --> 00:18:10,180
{\an1}And that I could never
understand his feelings.

320
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:17,424
{\an1}Hey, you were friends
with Orochimaru way

321
00:18:17,457 --> 00:18:19,427
{\an1}back, right, Pervy Sage?

322
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,630
{\an1}Why did he desert the
village and decide

323
00:18:21,664 --> 00:18:22,933
{\an1}to destroy the Hidden Leaf?

324
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,507
{\an1}-Orochimaru went through
a profound change

325
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,877
after both his
parents were killed,

326
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:35,516
{\an1}and that's when he became
obsessed with forbidden jutsu.

327
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:38,219
{\an1}I don't know if he was trying
to resurrect his parents,

328
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:40,156
{\an1}or to wreak vengeance
on the village

329
00:18:40,189 --> 00:18:42,961
{\an1}that he held responsible
for their deaths.

330
00:18:42,994 --> 00:18:48,602
{\an1}My parents weren't
killed, so-- like you, I

331
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:52,039
{\an1}was accused of not being able to
understand anything about him,

332
00:18:52,073 --> 00:18:53,775
or his feelings.

333
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:55,644
Perhaps he was
right, and I didn't

334
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,747
{\an1}understand a thing
about him, after all.

335
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:08,528
{\an1}However, even I'm able to see
that there's entirely too much

336
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:11,100
{\an1}hate in this shinobi
world of ours.

337
00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:13,702
{\an1}-There's too much hate?

338
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,170
{\an1}-I've always wanted
to do something

339
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:16,974
{\an1}about all of this hatred.

340
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:20,579
{\an1}I'm just not quite sure how
to go about it as of yet.

341
00:19:20,612 --> 00:19:23,750
{\an1}But I truly believe
that eventually the day

342
00:19:23,783 --> 00:19:26,855
{\an1}will come when all people
understand one another

343
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:28,423
{\an1}and live in harmony.

344
00:19:28,456 --> 00:19:31,494
{\an1}-Boy, it sounds kind
of complicated to me.

345
00:19:31,527 --> 00:19:34,431
{\an1}-And if I can't find the
solution to this problem, then

346
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,534
{\an1}perhaps I'll entrust
you to find it instead.

347
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:37,435
Eh, Naruto?

348
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,837
-Yes, sir.

349
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:41,875
{\an1}I can't turn down a request from
my master, can I, Pervy Sage?

350
00:19:41,908 --> 00:19:43,209
[laughter]

351
00:19:43,243 --> 00:19:44,245
-What?

352
00:19:44,278 --> 00:19:46,415
{\an1}What the hell's so
funny about that?

353
00:19:46,448 --> 00:19:49,185
{\an1}-Your smile is my
salvation, Naruto.

354
00:19:49,218 --> 00:19:51,555
-Huh?

355
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:54,526
-I'm very glad I
made you my student.

356
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,460
-Yeah?

357
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:57,063
You really are?

358
00:19:57,097 --> 00:20:00,333
{\an1}-But I haven't given up on doing
it myself just yet, you know?

359
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,536
-Huh?

360
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:06,109
{\an1}-I still plan to change
this world with my books.

361
00:20:06,142 --> 00:20:08,112
{\an1}-With those books you
don't sell, you mean?

362
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:09,212
-Fool!

363
00:20:09,245 --> 00:20:10,514
{\an1}They'll be best sellers
before you know it.

364
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:11,917
And when the day
finally arrives,

365
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,388
{\an1}I won't autograph your
copies, even if you beg me to!

366
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:19,794
{\an1}NARUTO: I don't want your
stupid autograph, anyway!

367
00:20:19,828 --> 00:20:20,896
{\an1}I don't want that, anyway.

368
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:29,842
{\an1}'Cause you gave me something
much more valuable.

369
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:30,342
Thank you.

370
00:20:47,298 --> 00:20:50,637
{\an1}-With so few people, it
sure is taking awhile.

371
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,574
{\an1}-Shut up, and focus
on the task at hand.

372
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:10,564
-It appears that
Sasuke has blundered.

373
00:21:14,603 --> 00:21:17,040
[laughter]

374
00:21:17,073 --> 00:21:18,609
{\an1}-It's an octopus leg.

375
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:20,179
-It's not funny.

376
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,014
[laughter]

377
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:35,833
[theme music]

378
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:45,847
[theme music]

379
00:22:56,711 --> 00:22:58,681
{\an1}NARUTO: What is this feeling?

380
00:22:58,714 --> 00:23:02,386
{\an1}I don't feel comfortable
being still at all.

381
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,490
{\an1}Is this what it feels like
to become one with nature?

382
00:23:05,524 --> 00:23:07,794
{\an1}I'm not using the
toad oil, but I

383
00:23:07,827 --> 00:23:10,597
{\an1}can tell the power is being
drawn from everywhere.

384
00:23:10,631 --> 00:23:12,667
I can feel it
gathering inside me,

385
00:23:12,701 --> 00:23:15,805
{\an1}building, and getting stronger.

386
00:23:15,838 --> 00:23:17,341
Is this it?

387
00:23:17,374 --> 00:23:20,510
Have I really
achieved Sage Mode?

388
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:25,418
{\an1}Next time on Naruto Shippuden,
Surpassing the Master.
