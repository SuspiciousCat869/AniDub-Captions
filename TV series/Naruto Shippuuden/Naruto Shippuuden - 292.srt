{\an1}<i>Brother Naruto!</i>

18
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:46,640
{\an1}Time to train!
Ninjutsu!

19
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:48,475
{\an1}Yeah!

20
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:51,143
{\an1}<i>You guys, Naruto's</i>

21
00:03:51,176 --> 00:03:55,279
<i>What?! But you told us</i>
<i>that you were gonna</i>
<i>teach us self-defense!</i>

22
00:03:55,848 --> 00:03:59,118
<i>And you call yourself</i>

23
00:03:59,150 --> 00:03:59,951
(annoyed grunt)

24
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:03,553
{\an1}<i>All right, you guys!</i>

25
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:06,390
{\an1}<i>Now, to overcome the</i>

<i>you'll face...</i>

26
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:09,158
{\an1}<i>...you'll need to build</i>
<i>up your strength and</i>
<i>physical fitness!</i>

27
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:13,095
{\an7}Of course, just diving
right into training
without a plan in mind
isn't gonna work!

28
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:15,097
{\an7}<i>So, I put together</i>

30
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:23,104
{\an4}And the name of this
plan is, Naruto's Miracle
Power Training! Make it
through this, and you'll

31
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,705
{\an1}be ready for anything!

32
00:04:25,673 --> 00:04:28,776
Hah! Looks like
this might be fun!

33
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:29,709
Wanna try, Brother?

34
00:04:29,742 --> 00:04:30,710
{\an1}Nah...

35
00:04:31,844 --> 00:04:33,278
{\an1}It sounds hard.

36
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:35,881
{\an1}I don't really want
to get all tired out.

37
00:04:35,915 --> 00:04:38,450
{\an1}Agh! Don't be such a
wimp! Whatever you do,

38
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:40,518
{\an1}<i>give it your all!</i>
<i>Right?!</i>

39
00:04:40,551 --> 00:04:42,386
Yeah! Right!

40
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,157
Good! First we'll run
down to the lake!
Let's go!

41
00:04:48,092 --> 00:04:50,694
{\an1}<i>Man, this is</i>

42
00:04:50,727 --> 00:04:53,163
<i>No kidding!</i>
<i>Hmph!</i>

43
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:56,198
{\an1}<i>What's this diversion</i>
<i>about, anyway?</i>

44
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:59,835
<i>You don't even know</i>
<i>what it means?! What</i>
<i>are you, stupid?</i>

45
00:05:00,035 --> 00:05:01,602
{\an1}Hmph!

46
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:05,073
{\an5}Hey, watch it! I'm
just trying to say
that being used by
Kabuto is the worst!

47
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:10,577
{\an4}Immortality was your
best trait! But look
at you, you're in
pieces. How pitiful!

48
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:15,347
{\an4}Oh, yeah? What about
you? Didn't you blow
yourself up or
something?

49
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:21,252
{\an5}Shut up! It was my
Ultimate Art, idiot!
I scattered, and it
was sublime! Hmph!

50
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:24,455
That's nothing to brag
about! So you died!

51
00:05:24,488 --> 00:05:26,523
{\an1}Don't get high and
mighty! You're the
same!

52
00:05:27,424 --> 00:05:31,327
<i>That's it! That</i>

{\an1}(heavy breathing)

55
00:05:35,765 --> 00:05:39,968
{\an1}Whew! I worked up a
nice sweat! But still,
that was too easy!

56
00:05:40,902 --> 00:05:44,638
{\an5}You all did just
great! How 'bout I
go buy some drinks
for everyone?

57
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:45,840
{\an1}Just wait here.

58
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,208

<i>You keep harping</i>

69
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:18,918
{\an4}It's always art this,
and art that! But all
the explosives you
design are so trashy!

70
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:20,753
{\an1}You're just an idiot!

71
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:25,256
{\an5}Well, your ceremonies
are always too long!
You know what it's like
having to go after you?!

72
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:29,359
{\an5}You don't need to go
after me, 'cause I
finish what I start
you phony artist!

73
00:07:29,393 --> 00:07:33,931
{\an4}Shut up! You can't do
anything if you step
out of that curse symbol
of yours, so there!

74
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,800
{\an1}Ah-ha! You know what?!
Maybe I should curse you!

75
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:41,103
Go ahead and try it!
I'd blow you up with
my art first!

(shocked gasp)

149
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,864
{\an1}It's the Chief!

150
00:14:12,898 --> 00:14:13,732
{\an1}<i>Grandpa!</i>

151
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,769
{\an1}Grandpa! Grandpa!

152
00:14:27,043 --> 00:14:30,013
You're both all
right! Oh, thank
goodness!

153
00:14:30,046 --> 00:14:32,214
{\an1}I'm so happy you're
okay, too, Chief.

154
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:38,019
{\an5}Yes, aside from my
eyes. I was wondering
across the wilderness
when somebody came

155
00:14:38,052 --> 00:14:39,220
along and saved me.

156
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,789
<i>Dokku, I put such</i>
<i>a burden on you.</i>

157
00:14:42,822 --> 00:14:44,224
{\an1}No. It's fine.

158
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:47,994
<i>By the way, I have</i>
<i>something important</i>
<i>to ask you.</i>

159
00:14:48,028 --> 00:14:49,062
{\an1}Okay...

160
00:14:50,263 --> 00:14:53,365
{\an1}On that night, do you
remember the items that
I gave you?

161
00:14:56,569 --> 00:15:00,871
{\an1}<i>Now, you may already</i>
<i>have guessed what I'm</i>
<i>about to tell you, but...</i>

162
00:15:01,406 --> 00:15:05,542
{\an1}<i>They're a part of the</i>
<i>treasure that was hidden</i>
<i>in the village altar.</i>

163
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:14,617
{\an4}<i>To ensure that the</i>
<i>treasure remained safe</i>
<i>from the invaders, I</i>
<i>entrusted parts of it</i>

164
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:19,054
{\an1}<i>to another guard, just</i>
<i>as I entrusted you</i>
<i>with yours.</i>

165
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,358
{\an1}Regrettably, however,
five of the parts,
including my own...

166
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:27,394
{\an1}<i>Are now in the hands</i>
<i>of the enemy.</i>

167
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,036
{\an1}<i>The remaining two pieces</i>
<i>must be protected at</i>
<i>all costs.</i>

168
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:44,874
{\an5}And that is why I
would like, Disonasu
here, to take custody
of them and help us

169
00:15:44,908 --> 00:15:45,909
keep them safe.

170
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:46,544
{\an1}(affirmative grunt)

171
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,913
{\an1}But Chief, you're
sure about this?

172
00:15:51,046 --> 00:15:53,882
<i>Yes. That is</i>
<i>my decision.</i>

173
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,684
{\an1}I understand.

174
00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:57,686
{\an1}<i>So...</i>

175
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,521
{\an1}Where are they?
Give them to me,

176
00:16:01,522 --> 00:16:02,257
{\an1}(frightened gasp)

177
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:04,659
{\an1}Yes, sir. Of course.

178
00:16:04,692 --> 00:16:05,759
{\an3}<i>No!</i>

179
00:16:08,161 --> 00:16:09,730
{\an1}Grandpa isn't right!

180
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,601
{\an1}Huh? He's been...

181
00:16:15,635 --> 00:16:16,968
Reanimated?!

182
00:16:17,536 --> 00:16:19,337
{\an7}<i>She's quite sharp.</i>

183
00:16:19,571 --> 00:16:20,105
Huh?

184
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:22,674
{\an1}She must be
very special.

185
00:16:23,575 --> 00:16:24,709
{\an1}<i>Kabuto!</i>

186
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:37,486
(angry growl)

187
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,887
{\an1}We've been tricked!

188
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,088
(evil chuckle)

189
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,392
{\an1}<i>I'm going to take fatso</i>
<i>over there and squeeze</i>
<i>information out of him!</i>

190
00:16:44,725 --> 00:16:46,460
{\an1}And after that...

191
00:16:46,661 --> 00:16:47,561
(evil laugh)

192
00:16:57,903 --> 00:16:58,604
(attack yell)

193
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:18,321
(shocked gasp)

194
00:17:29,263 --> 00:17:30,664
{\an1}<i>Chief!</i>

195
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,499
Grandpa!

196
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:42,708
{\an1}So, a sacrifice that's
almost dead is useless.

197
00:17:44,175 --> 00:17:46,644
{\an1}(fighting grunts)

198
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:06,828
{\an3}Sorry!

199
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:17,069
{\an1}Agh!

200
00:18:27,645 --> 00:18:28,045
(shocked gasps)

201
00:18:28,078 --> 00:18:32,316
(painful grunts)

202
00:18:34,685 --> 00:18:37,120
What is it, Naruto?!
What's the matter?!

203
00:18:38,121 --> 00:18:42,324
{\an1}(painful screaming)

204
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,461
{\an8}<i>Take it...</i>

205
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:50,097
{\an8}<i>Take it!</i>

206

{\an1}Get out! Get out!

209
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:07,478
Mina, please, you
have to stop this!

210
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:08,979
{\an1}Ahh!

211
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:17,386
