Fight me now.

I wanted to kick your butt.

160
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:43,991
Blast!

161
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:54,533
{\an1}Stop it! No, you guys!

162
00:11:02,142 --> 00:11:07,347
{\an4}That Chidori. It was
not the size youd aim
at a comrade from the
Leaf Village.

163
00:11:08,314 --> 00:11:10,449
{\an1}<i>Were you really going</i>

Listen, Sakura.

{\an1}This is between us,
stay out of it.

167

{\an7}<i>Before I knew it, Naruto had</i>

168

169

{\an1}Im not the same as you.
Im traveling a path the
rest of you can't follow.

170
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:53,424
{\an1}But Sasuke! I'm so in love with
you that I can't even stand it!

171
00:11:53,957 --> 00:11:58,996
{\an1}If you would only be with me,
I promise, I would never let
you regret it!

172
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:01,065
Every day will be a joy!

173
00:12:01,098 --> 00:12:03,267

{\an1}Ill even help get your revenge!
Ill do whatever it takes to
make it happen, I swear!

176
00:12:11,908 --> 00:12:14,811
{\an1}So stay here with me.

177
00:12:16,312 --> 00:12:17,879
<i>And if you can't,</i>

178
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:20,816
<i>Then take me</i>
<i>with you, Sasuke.</i>

{\an1}You havent changed.

181
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:34,496
{\an1}You're still annoying.

182
00:12:34,728 --> 00:12:35,696
[gasp]

183
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:48,109
{\an1}Just bring him home.
Please, bring Sasuke
back to me.

184
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:52,046
{\an1}Don't you worry one bit.
I'm gonna bring Sasuke back.

185
00:12:52,713 --> 00:12:55,116
{\an1}I promise that on
my life, Sakura!

186
00:12:55,983 --> 00:13:00,854
{\an7}<i>I didn't even think about it.</i>
<i>I put the entire burden on</i>
<i>you, Naruto.</i>

187
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:11,598
{\an7}<i>I went crying to you,</i>
<i>clung to you, and expected</i>
<i>you to make it all better.</i>

188
00:13:17,636 --> 00:13:18,971
{\an7}<i>While I did nothing.</i>

189
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:22,242
{\an7}<i>That's why, this time,</i>

190
00:13:23,976 --> 00:13:25,512
Sorry, Naruto.

191
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:28,814
{\an1}You may have to wait
for me a little bit.

192
00:13:30,082 --> 00:13:31,817
{\an1}Next time I'm coming too!

193
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,655
{\an7}<i>I tried it my own way,</i>

194
00:13:38,323 --> 00:13:40,325
{\an7}<i>to catch up to the two of you.</i>

195
00:13:44,795 --> 00:13:46,030
{\an8}<i>But Sasuke,</i>

196
00:13:46,632 --> 00:13:49,700
{\an7}<i>is no longer the person</i>
<i>we once thought he was.</i>

197
00:13:50,134 --> 00:13:52,370
{\an7}<i>He's far beyond our reach now.</i>

198
00:14:14,757 --> 00:14:18,161
It doesnt matter even
if there isnt a promise
between us anymore.

199
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:23,232
{\an1}Because rescuing Sasuke is just
something that I have to do.

200
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,135
{\an4}Auugh!
Enough!
I'm going
home!

201
00:14:33,642 --> 00:14:36,078
{\an7}<i>Naruto. I'm so sorry!</i>

202
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:40,382
{\an7}<i>But Im also grateful.</i>

203
00:14:40,982 --> 00:14:47,021
{\an7}<i>However, I've already</i>
<i>decided. I'm going to take</i>
<i>care of Sasuke myself!</i>

204
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:01,001
That was a
narrow escape.

205
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:08,742
{\an1}For the shinobi world and
the Leaf, I cannot let
you two continue to live!

206
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:12,446
Ah!

207
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,948
{\an1}It's a Reverse Tetragram
Sealing Jutsu!

208
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,817
{\an1}Sasuke! Get away from Danzo!

209
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:43,208
{\an4}<i>[Madara]</i>
<i>It was a Collateral Damage</i>
<i>Sealing Jutsu. It drags you into</i>
<i>his corpse, sealing you inside.</i>

210

{\an1}He probably had it set
to activate at the
moment of his death.

211
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:57,855
That was close.

212
00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:02,627
{\an1}Now that's done.
It's on to the Hidden Leaf.

213
00:16:03,294 --> 00:16:05,062
{\an1}The Hidden Leaf, huh?

214
00:16:11,468 --> 00:16:13,070
I'm taking his eye.

215
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:16,674
Sasuke.
Don't be so hasty.

216
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:18,742
Go back to the
hideout and rest.

Your eyes are
losing their light.

219

What can you do by
yourself in the
Hidden Leaf, anyway?

220
00:16:32,055 --> 00:16:36,426
{\an1}Remember, patience is
necessary to reach one's goal.

221
00:16:59,448 --> 00:17:02,950
{\an1}Sasuke. I'm going to give
you one piece of advice.

222
00:17:04,553 --> 00:17:05,587
