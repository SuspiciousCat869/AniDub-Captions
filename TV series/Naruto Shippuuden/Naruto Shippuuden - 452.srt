we've decided to revise a

[grunting]

128
00:08:32,072 --> 00:08:35,274
{\an1}As it stands now, the Leaf

129
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:37,275
to the training
grounds, doesn't it?

130
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:42,080
{\an1}Well, this new location
would be near an area
that's ideal for training.

131
00:08:42,114 --> 00:08:46,317
{\an1}You can use it exclusively
as the Uchiha's training
grounds.

To continue...

133

{\an1}Now, once the Leaf Police
Headquarters is rebuilt...

134

{\an1}...the whole Uchiha Clan
will move here.

135
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,894
{\an1}Any homes and buildings that
were spared will be left as
they are...

136
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:06,566
{\an1}<i>During the Nine Tails</i>

<i>Sharingan to manipulate Nine</i>
<i>Tails! </i>

138
00:09:10,037 --> 00:09:13,639
{\an1}And what's even worse, there
are some who believe that
the Uchiha actually caused

139

{\an1}the Nine Tails Incident!

order to keep an eye on us!

141
00:09:18,777 --> 00:09:23,246
{\an1}It's just like during the
Second Hokage's era when
the Uchiha were rounded up

142
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,615
{\an1}and isolated in one part of
the village!

{\an1}This time, it's even
farther away!

{\an1}The village doesn't
trust us!

to accept this move. All of

312
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:23,396
{\an1}I have to get back.

313
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:24,730
{\an1}You do?

314
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:27,366
Shisui?

315
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,233
{\an1}Huh?

316
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:33,337
{\an1}<i>Why must there be</i>
<i>fighting in life?</i>

317
00:19:33,738 --> 00:19:37,674
{\an1}Who knows?
Although...

318
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:40,976
{\an1}<i>... if the fighting</i>
<i>can be stopped, I'd</i>
<i>like to stop it.</i>

319
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,445
Uh! Me, too!

320
00:19:49,017 --> 00:19:50,018
{\an1}See ya...

321
00:19:51,553 --> 00:19:53,655
<i>In addition to</i>
<i>the Clone Jutsu,</i>

322
00:19:53,687 --> 00:19:56,356
{\an1}<i>which is a requirement</i>
<i>for graduating the</i>
<i>Academy...</i>

323
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:01,360
{\an1}...Itachi Uchiha has already
mastered the Shadow Clone
Jutsu, a forbidden jutsu.

324
00:20:01,394 --> 00:20:05,330
{\an1}And he excels in every other
subject. There's no point
in keeping him at the

325
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:06,464
{\an1}Academy any longer.

326
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:09,166
{\an1}Didn't he just enter as a
freshman this year?

327
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,967
{\an1}<i>Yes. </i>

328
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,967
{\an1}That doesn't really matter.

329
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,203
{\an1}This has happened before.

330
00:20:13,236 --> 00:20:17,940
{\an1}Yes, but that was a
different era. This
is not an age of war.

331
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,841
{\an1}The boy is a genius,
isn't that right?

332
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,311
{\an1}I've never seen a student
like him before.

333
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:28,683
{\an1}So you think it would
be better for Itachi
to graduate early?

334
00:20:28,715 --> 00:20:29,816
<i>Graduate? </i>

335
00:20:30,617 --> 00:20:33,185
{\an1}After just a single
year at the Academy?

336
00:20:33,219 --> 00:20:34,153
{\an1}<i>Yeah. </i>

337
00:20:35,354 --> 00:20:38,122
{\an1}But the teacher said
that both parents still
have to agree.

338
00:20:38,156 --> 00:20:40,458
{\an1}So they want to talk
to you two at the school.

339
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,627
Oh, I see!

340
00:20:43,361 --> 00:20:45,229
Well, that's my
boy, Itachi.

341
00:20:45,262 --> 00:20:47,197
[whining]

342
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,566
Uh! Hm?

343
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,235
[cooing]

344
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:56,304
Heh.

345
00:20:57,505 --> 00:21:01,475
{\an1}Graduates, you'll be
assigned missions by the
village.

346
00:21:01,508 --> 00:21:05,511
{\an1}We're going to be putting
you all into teams comprised
of three shinobi.

347
00:21:05,878 --> 00:21:10,048
{\an1}Each one of those teams...
will be under the leadership
of an experienced jonin.

348
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:14,385
{\an1}Whenever you're sent out on
a mission... you'll be under
their guidance.

349
00:21:19,155 --> 00:21:22,459
{\an1}All right. Now, I'm
going to announce
the teams.

350
00:22:57,703 --> 00:23:00,003
{\an1}<i>Hey, Big Brother!</i>
<i>What is this?</i>

351
00:23:00,036 --> 00:23:02,505
{\an1}<i>Oh, that's from that time...</i>

352
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:09,645
{\an1}<i>Life is born... and life</i>
<i>dies... But sometimes...</i>
<i>life is saved again... </i>

353
00:23:09,678 --> 00:23:12,313
{\an1}<i>Wait... when I saved</i>
<i>him back then... </i>

354
00:23:12,347 --> 00:23:14,749
{\an1}<i>... I didn't really</i>
<i>think too deeply</i>
<i>about it.</i>

355
00:23:16,351 --> 00:23:19,952
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "The Pain of</i>
<i>Living." </i>

356
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,222
{\an1}<i>We formed a bond. That's</i>
<i>why it happened.</i>
