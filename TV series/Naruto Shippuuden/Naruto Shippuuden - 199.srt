{\an1}<i>[Temari]</i>
<i>Kankuro, You're late!</i>

2
00:00:11,569 --> 00:00:14,303
{\an1}<i>[Kankuro]</i>
<i>Assembling my new puppets</i>
<i>took longer than I thought.</i>

3
00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:17,739
Goodbye Lord Kazekage!
Please take care!

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,208
{\an1}Lord Kankuro, Lady Temari.
We're counting on you.

5
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:22,975
Yeah, we know.

6
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:26,677
{\an1}But Gaara doesn't
really need bodyguards.
Why are we going?

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,344
{\an1}Come on. Time to go.

8
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,715
{\an1}Among all the Five Kage,
Gaara's gonna be the
youngest one.

9
00:00:35,716 --> 00:00:39,184
It's our duty to make
sure the other Kage
don't take him lightly.

10
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:42,552
{\an1}A Five Kage Summit.

11
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:46,889
{\an1}You know, I can't help
but wonder what all the
other Kage are like.

12
00:00:56,995 --> 00:00:59,796
Kurotsuchi, Akatsuchi,
good luck!

13
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:01,363
Lord Tsuchikage!

14
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:03,965
Go teach all those
other village leaders
a thing or two!

15
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,467
{\an1}Augh! Going to summits
at my age is such a chore.

16
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:12,636
{\an1}All those young'uns
romping around with no
regard for my discomfort.

17
00:01:12,669 --> 00:01:14,403
They forget about
my bad back?

18
00:01:15,072 --> 00:01:17,639
{\an1}Well, gramps, Why don't
you just retire, then?

19
00:01:18,073 --> 00:01:20,441
{\an1}I mean, why bother trying to
drag out the glory?

20
00:01:20,474 --> 00:01:23,843
{\an1}Ha ha ha ha ha!
Here, let me carry
that pack for you.

21
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,577
{\an1}Okay, Lord Tsuchikage?

22
00:01:26,577 --> 00:01:27,678
D'rrrrgh!

23
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:31,081
Hands off, Akatsuchi!
I can get this!

24
00:01:32,047 --> 00:01:34,816
{\an1}[old man grumbling]
Grm... Whippersnappers..

25
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,686
{\an1}Heh hah! It's nothing! See?

26
00:01:42,988 --> 00:01:43,721
[crack]

27
00:01:50,558 --> 00:01:54,360
Aa-aaah!
My back!

28
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:58,163
{\an1}Listen, Gramps,
You wanna send
someone else instead?

29
00:01:58,562 --> 00:02:02,031
{\an1}Why you impudent little fool!
Just who do you think I am?!

30
00:02:02,064 --> 00:02:06,001
{\an1}I am Tsuchikage Ohnoki,
the Great Fence Sitter
of the Hidden Stone!

31
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:09,301
{\an1}Hmph! I shall carry
my own pack, thankyou!

32
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:13,471
Hrr-r-r-r-r...

33
00:02:13,504 --> 00:02:14,538
H'augh!

34
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:19,440
{\an1}[sigh] What did you expect?
You stubborn geezer...

35
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:31,081
{\an1}Very well, you may carry your
own pack if you really want to.

36
00:02:32,582 --> 00:02:34,116
All right! Let's be off!

37
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:39,318
{\an1}Of all the insolent...
Fine, I don't care!

38
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,288
{\an1}Admit it, Gramps,
that's better, isn't it?

39
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:54,427
We entrust the
honorable Mizukage
to your care.

40
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,895
{\an1}Make sure the Mizukage
doesn't overdo it.

41
00:02:57,163 --> 00:02:58,462
I know; I will.

42
00:03:23,644 --> 00:03:24,945
{\an1}<i>Thank you very much.</i>

43
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,612
{\an1}Lord Great Elder,

44
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:31,182
{\an1}By my title of Mizukage,
I'll fulfill my duties
with brilliance.

45
00:03:32,115 --> 00:03:33,583
Heh-heh heh
heh heh!

46
00:03:33,616 --> 00:03:36,185
{\an1}As one of the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen of the Mist,

47
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:38,953
{\an1}Protect Lady Mizukage
well, Chojuro.

48
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,055
{\an1}Uh, Yes, sir. All three of
us should be just fine.

49
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,422
Well, I hope.

50
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,925
{\an1}You should have more confidence
in yourself. You're very strong.

51
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,760
{\an1}After all, That's why I
chose you to accompany
me to the summit.

52
00:03:53,594 --> 00:03:54,828
'kay, Chojuro?

53
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:58,430
{\an1}Uh... Yes, ma'am!
I'll do my
absolute best!

54
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,131
{\an1}Well, I hope.

55
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,633
{\an8}<i>She's so kind.</i>

56
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:07,903
{\an5}Yes, ma'am's all
you should say!
That spineless attitude
is useless!

57
00:04:08,402 --> 00:04:11,571
The youths these
days are just all
made of weakness.

58
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:14,273
{\an7}<i>Old maid...? </i>

59
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:19,142
{\an1}Ao! Enough with the lecturing!
Now get moving or you're going
to be late!

60
00:04:19,942 --> 00:04:22,178
{\an7}<i>It's too late...</i>
<i>for marriage?!!</i>

61
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:26,347
{\an1}My lecture's good advice!
Why, back in my day...

62
00:04:27,413 --> 00:04:29,215
Shut up. Or die.

63
00:04:30,082 --> 00:04:31,283
Uhh??

64
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:35,885
{\an1}All right, Chojuro!
Ao! Let's depart!

65
00:04:37,785 --> 00:04:41,855
{\an7}<i>I shall defend kind Lady</i>
<i>Mizukage's smile to the</i>
<i>best of my abilities!</i>

66
00:04:42,822 --> 00:04:44,090
{\an8}<i>I hope I can...</i>

67
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,892
{\an1}Uhhn...

68
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:51,261
What are you doing, Ao?
Lady Mizukage's leaving!

69
00:04:51,294 --> 00:04:51,994
{\an1}Huh?!

70
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:53,694
Oh, no!

71
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,763
{\an1}<i>Lady Mizukage! Please wait!</i>

72
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:06,303
{\an1}<i>[Raikage]</i>
<i>Still no word</i>
<i>from Team Samui?!</i>

73
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:12,405
{\an1}<i>No, sir. All communication has</i>
<i>been silent. But I do expect</i>
<i>to hear something soon.</i>

74
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:16,407
{\an1}Samui has already been informed
of the route you will be taking
to the summit, Lord Raikage.

75
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:22,212
{\an1}The plan is for her to
rendezvous with you directly
or send a messenger bird.

76
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:25,713
{\an1}Good! All right, then.
I'll be heading out, too!

77
00:05:32,384 --> 00:05:34,251
{\an1}Let's go! Cee! Darui!

78
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:34,885
Sir!

79
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:36,552
Sure.

80
00:05:36,886 --> 00:05:37,953
Come along!

81
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:42,789
[sigh] Not again!

82
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:45,225
Let's go, Darui.

83
00:05:45,258 --> 00:05:48,726
{\an1}No, thanks. I'll just take the
stairs like normal people.

84
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:51,395
{\an1}You go on ahead,
I'll catch up.

85
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:36,455
Enter the Five Kage!

86
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:47,493
Lord Danzo, sir.

87
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:48,427
I know.

88
00:07:50,494 --> 00:07:52,563
{\an1}I haven't seen battle
in quite a while.

89
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:55,831
{\an1}This is a perfect chance to get
my muscles limbered up again.

90
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:58,532
{\an1}Do not interfere.

91
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:00,600
{\an1}I'll take care of them.

92
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:04,870
[sharp inhale]

93
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,874
{\an1}Augh! Hungh! Oof!

94
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:25,448
{\an1}Is your target the Hokage?
Or are you after me personally?

95
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:28,484
{\an1}Please... just kill me...

96
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,452
{\an1}Well, not that it
really matters.

97
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:46,726
{\an1}Seven, eight, nine, ten...

98
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:49,062
{\an1}Seventeen total, eh?

99
00:08:56,366 --> 00:08:58,533
{\an1}Okay! I'm ready to go!

100
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:01,168
{\an1}No, this whole thing
is far from okay!

101
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:03,836
{\an1}Are you serious about
going to meet the Raikage?

102
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,406
Of course! I'm going
to convince him to
forgive Sasuke!

103
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:11,074
{\an1}But that being said,
you don't even know
where the Raikage is!

104
00:09:11,107 --> 00:09:13,742
You know, I bet you
could help him with
that, Yamato.

105
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:15,109
{\an1}What?!

106
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:16,511
See ya!

107
00:09:19,678 --> 00:09:21,913
{\an1}Kakashi, you gotta be kidding.

108
00:09:22,814 --> 00:09:25,215
{\an1}<i>I'm here to challenge you,</i>
<i>Big Brother Naruto!</i>

109
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:27,984
{\an1}Huh? wait, I know
that voice...

110
00:09:35,587 --> 00:09:36,587
Uh!

111
00:09:37,822 --> 00:09:40,624
{\an1}I'd appreciate it if didn't tell
the Hokage of Naruto's plans.

112
00:09:40,657 --> 00:09:41,458
{\an1}Oh...

113
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:43,292
Say nothing's going on.

114
00:09:43,691 --> 00:09:47,861
{\an1}I see. So it appears that
you still can't bring
yourself to trust me.

115
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:52,264
Well you are Danzo's
subordinate, assigned
to spy on Naruto.

116
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:59,535
But you're also a
member of Team 7,
my Team Kakashi.

117
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:03,670
So I do believe in you.

118
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:11,008
{\an1}There was one
other thing he said:
he believed in me!

119
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:14,410
{\an7}<i>What is this that I'm feeling?</i>

120
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:16,311
Catch you later!

121
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,014
Hm.

122
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:26,417
<i>Auugghh!</i>
<i>[gurgle]</i>

123
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:36,022
{\an4}These are remnants of the
Hannya Black Ops from the
Land of Woods that we
slew in the past.

124
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:41,025
{\an5}It has always
been like this.
Foe seizing a
chance to strike.

125
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:46,594
{\an1}Your coming into the open
may increase our headaches
in lots of ways.

126
00:10:46,627 --> 00:10:51,597
{\an4}Ninja once belonged to
a world of ascetics.
To be nameless was a
source of pride.

127
00:10:52,264 --> 00:10:57,067
{\an4}By controlling what's
seen and what's hidden,
one can truly strengthen
village and nation.

128
00:10:57,434 --> 00:11:02,437
{\an1}<i>I will make sure that this</i>
<i>summit is a success and that</i>
<i>I am acknowledged as Hokage.</i>

129
00:11:03,003 --> 00:11:06,806
{\an1}Then even the Jonin Council will
have no choice but to accept me.

130
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,976
{\an1}At last, my time
has finally come.

131
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,748
{\an1}Hey, what's
going on?

132
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,050
I have no idea.
What are they doing?

133
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,185
Haaa!

134
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:30,053
{\an1}Haaa!

135
00:11:32,454 --> 00:11:33,821
Sexy Jutsu!

136
00:11:34,288 --> 00:11:35,021
[gasps]

137
00:11:40,258 --> 00:11:43,393
{\an1}Sweet dreams. Enjoy those
illusions of Naruto.

138
00:11:43,427 --> 00:11:47,563
{\an1}Or were you interested
in their Sexy Jutsu?
So sorry.

139
00:11:48,597 --> 00:11:52,899
{\an1}It seems the Foundation is
beginning not to trust Sai.
Hmm.

140
00:11:52,932 --> 00:11:54,733
{\an1}<i>Awww!!</i>

141
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:57,568
{\an1}<i>Yours is way</i>
<i>sexier than mine!</i>

142
00:11:57,602 --> 00:11:58,668
Now...

143
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,737
{\an1}Damn it! No way! I lose again!

144
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,039
{\an1}You always keep widening the
gap between us, Big Bro.

145
00:12:06,073 --> 00:12:08,674
{\an1}We're supposed to be
rivals, you know!

146
00:12:10,008 --> 00:12:11,243
Hey, I heard!

147
00:12:11,276 --> 00:12:11,976
{\an1}Huh?

148
00:12:13,477 --> 00:12:16,146
{\an1}Someone told me that you
took down one of the Pains
with your Rasengan!

149
00:12:16,745 --> 00:12:17,746
Mmh.

150
00:12:19,414 --> 00:12:22,115
{\an1}I only pulled it off
'cause I was desperate.

151
00:12:22,983 --> 00:12:23,782
Huh?

152
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:25,817
You did a good job,
Konohamaru!

153
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,520
{\an1}You're a hero of the
Hidden Leaf Village, too!

154
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,526
{\an1}You know, you pick up
things quicker than I do!

155
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:43,127
{\an1}Next time, I'll teach you how
to do the Giant Rasengan!

156
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:45,228
Yeah!

157
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,602
My hand hurts from
all this writing!

158
00:12:56,868 --> 00:13:00,870
{\an5}What if I get
tendonitis and
it affects my
sword skills?

159
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:03,640
And that shortcoming
leads to me going
down in battle...

160
00:13:04,972 --> 00:13:10,075
{\an1}And despite the frantic
efforts of all the girls on
the Medical Team, then I die.

161
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:13,311
{\an1}Keep moving your hand,
not your tongue, big mouth!

162
00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:15,546
Hmm...

163
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:19,615
{\an4}We gotta copy the Intel on
Sasuke and the Akatsuki,
Now hurry up or we're
going to be here forever!

'Scuse me, could you
please try to keep
your voices down?

quite a burden.

00:14:59,438 --> 00:15:01,038
Are you all right
carrying it?

185
00:15:01,072 --> 00:15:04,907
{\an1}Oh. I'm fine.
Though I'm feeling
a bit feverish.

186
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,243
Let's see...

187
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:13,012
Well, it does feel
like you might have a
slight temperature.

188

{\an1}Lady Fifth, you spoil
Chojuro too much!

{\an1}This is why the young these days
get so full of themselves!

It's no longer the dark
time when we were called
the Blood Mist Village.

{\an1}The nightmare created by the
Fourth Mizukage is long over.

195
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:37,360
You'd do well not to
bring up the past.

196
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:40,194
Yes, I--
Forgive me, ma'am.

197
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:45,664

depressing talk, and have
some supper instead.

{\an1}I'm looking forward to the
meal this inn has made.

Ah!?

200
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,301
I hope you've engaged
an appetizing dinner.

for all of our
meals, haven't
you, Chojuro?

205
00:16:02,073 --> 00:16:03,907
{\an1}There were just
so many choices!

206
00:16:03,941 --> 00:16:06,276
{\an1}So I had a lot of
trouble making up
my mind!

207
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:08,410
{\an1}In the end, I
couldn't decide.

stone's throw away from here.

something just up ahead!

{\an1}What?

223
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:08,544
This is my first trip
to the Land of Iron.
I'm really excited!

224
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:11,646
{\an1}Oh, please.
It really isn't
such a nice place.

225
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,280
{\an1}Why don't you tell us
what it's like, Gramps?

{\an1}<i>It lies among three mountains</i>
<i>known as the Three Wolves.</i>

culture and law different from
that of the Land of Earth?

230
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,592
{\an1}There's a long-standing
rule that shinobi shall
not engage them,

231
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:37,827
{\an1}and in fact, the Land
of Iron does not have
any shinobi at all.

{\an1}They've fortified their

Five Kage Summit.

You have to use
the animals.

237
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:02,841
{\an1}And scout out the
least-defended route you can
find to the Summit site.

00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:04,409
Right, I'm on it.

arrival, Lord Kazekage.

Shh!

{\an1}Brr! Boy, it just got really
cold all of a sudden.

Hey, we're on a
stealth mission!
So, shh!

251
00:18:49,634 --> 00:18:50,535
Well, then?

252
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:54,937
{\an1}There's a route that
climbs up from the West.
Not too many lookouts.

253
00:18:55,605 --> 00:19:00,273
{\an1}Karin, keep an eye on the
chakra positions of the guards.
It's time to go in.

254
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,108
{\an1}What? I'm coming, too?!

255
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,610
Yep, it's finally time
for you to let those
skills of yours shine.

00:19:07,611 --> 00:19:08,679
That's right.

00:19:10,012 --> 00:19:13,148
I need you to confirm
which one is Danzo.
You're coming too.

259
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,855
{\an1}Looks like a
message from Sai.

260
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:35,827
What is it?

261
00:19:37,027 --> 00:19:40,630
{\an1}Nothing, it's just
a routine report.
Let's go.

262
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:50,069
{\an1}Can't we just ambush
and off him now?
I'm pooped already.

263
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:52,670
What are you,
stupid?!

264
00:19:52,704 --> 00:19:56,938
{\an4}If the Hokage's arrival
is delayed, they'll know
that something happened
to him on the way there.

265
00:19:56,972 --> 00:20:02,041
{\an4}Then they'll send in a swarm
of samurai reinforcements.
And what if the other Kage
come, too, huh?

266
00:20:02,342 --> 00:20:07,512
{\an4}We don't know the enemy's
abilities, you idiot, so it's
best to bide our time and just
attack him on his way home.

267
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:09,346
Right, Sasuke?

268
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,481
{\an1}Hgh.

269
00:20:12,581 --> 00:20:15,550
{\an1}Just focus on the enemy's
chakra positions, Karin.

270
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,117
Ha ha! Busted.

271
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:18,951
Shut up!

272
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,888
Wow, Sasuke, It
seems you have
your hands full.

273
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,856
{\an1}All that matters is that
you identify Danzo before
the Summit starts.

274
00:20:26,122 --> 00:20:27,524
{\an1}You'd better not lie.

275
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:33,427
{\an4}That's right, I'm attuned
to chakra. And a person's
chakra always becomes
muddied when they lie.

276
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:37,128
{\an1}So just remember, I'll
be keeping an eye on
your chakra, got it?

277
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:43,833
{\an1}There's no reason to lie to you.
After all, Danzo is a hindrance
to the Akatsuki too.

278
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:51,336
{\an1}Lord Raikage, it's Team Samui.

279
00:20:51,503 --> 00:20:52,937
{\an1}Good. Let's descend!

280
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:58,073
{\an1}My lord, We've returned from
the Hidden Leaf Village.

281
00:20:58,107 --> 00:20:59,442
And how did it
go there?

282
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,976
Samui, you've
been tailed.

283
00:21:03,444 --> 00:21:04,411
What?

284
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:06,612
{\an1}Show yourselves,

286
00:21:15,284 --> 00:21:16,819
