Brother, I'm feeling
kind of stuffed.

00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,518
I don't think I
can drink anymore.

Hold it in your

After it's in your chest, come
on and exhale all at once.

This'll help you let it all out!

base is in the vicinity,

-We need a solution
before we face them.

So do what you
have to, but hurry.

knowing that a confrontation
with the four of us

would waste a lot of time.

Or they'll hit us hard.

is to capture the bad guys

00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,315
No matter what.

172
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,484
If we lose track of
the enemy, something

173
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,028
tells me they're going to become
a big problem for the Hidden

174
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,030
Leaf village.

175
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,449
-We have to keep searching.

176
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,534
-Right.

177
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,369
-Well, time to head out.

178
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,121
Shino, try to catch up soon, OK?

179
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,205
-OK.

180
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,373
-You shouldn't have any
trouble tracking us.

181
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,124
Good luck.

182
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,218
-Hidden Jutsu.

183
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:30,844
Insect Cocoon.

184
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,524
-I'm back.

185
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,900
-Hey, Guren!

186
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,068
-Ha.

187
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,362
I'm surprised lowlifes
like you didn't betray me

188
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,905
while I was out.

189
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,324
-Come on, you know
us better than that.

190
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,951
The second we left
the hideout, we all

191
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,996
decided we were going to
follow you no matter what.

192
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:58,913
-Oh, hey.

193
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,248
Which do you like better?

194
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,208
Red camellias or white ones?

195
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,044
-Who's the kid?

196
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,170
-Yukimaru.

197
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,339
Lord Orochimaru told
us to take care of him.

198
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,549
-Lord Orochimaru did?

199
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,262
-Now, listen up, people.

200
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,682
Lord Orochimaru has given
us a very important mission.

201
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:21,853
We have to deliver this boy
to a specific lake, safely.

202
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:25,690
Mistakes will not be tolerated.

203
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,610
However, a group of
strangers have followed us

204
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,361
from the hideout.

205
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,781
-That's pretty
perceptive of you, Guren.

206
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,116
Just what I'd expect from you.

207
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,285
But we've already
looked into it.

208
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,411
-Tell me.

209
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,537
-Of course.

210
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,373
The enemy has four ninja
and one ninja hound.

211
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,542
Gozu and I identified
the mutt's pawprints.

212
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,131
Right now, three of them and the
dog are a couple of kilometers

213
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:53,718
away from our position,
slowly making their way here.

214
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,095
-They found us?

215
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,930
What's wrong with Kiho's jutsu?

216
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,139
-Don't worry.

217
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,809
I'm sure Kiho rendered the
hound's nose completely

218
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,601
useless.

219
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,186
-I see.

220
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:06,356
So these Shinobi must have
high-level tracking skills,

221
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,067
which means they're
from the Leaf village.

222
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:09,943
-Just as I suspected.

223
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,861
It's the Leaf.

224
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,739
What do we do?

225
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,574
-I know just the thing.

226
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,870
And when I'm through, they
won't be following us anymore.

227
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:24,582
Bring them to me, and
I will crush them.

228
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:28,753
[tapping]

229
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,755
-What's all the ruckus about?

230
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,299
-I found out about
the mission, Grandma.

231
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,008
-Really?

232
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:34,509
-Augh!

233
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:35,635
Come on.

234
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,554
Whatever it is, you've
got to let me go, too.

235
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,805
-No, Naruto.

236
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,266
We didn't tell you because
we were worried about you.

237
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,350
-Worried?

238
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,310
-I understand how you
feel about Sasuke,

239
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,854
but even if you
find him, you're not

240
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,605
strong enough to bring him back.

241
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,024
Besides, if you use
that new jutsu--

242
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,317
-I won't use it.

243
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,195
Wind-Style Rasen
Shuriken is off-limits.

244
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,029
Trust me.

245
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,364
I know what my body can handle.

246
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,157
-Then why would y--

247
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,575
-Naruto.

248
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,326
Would you mind
telling me why you're

249
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,495
applying for this mission?

250
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:07,876
-Because-- it's just-- well,
I know I'm not powerful enough

251
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,671
to overcome Sasuke, but Pervy
Sage said something to me that

252
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,965
got me thinking.

253
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:17,177
-They say, wherever someone
is still thinking of you,

254
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,013
that place is your home.

255
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,223
-I believe if you care
about someone enough,

256
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,559
you can change their mind.

257
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,978
I want to find
Sasuke and tell him.

258
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,938
He can come back.

259
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,608
Because this place is his home.

260
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,108
-Hmm.

261
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,534
[sigh]

262
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,202
-Go ahead, then.

263
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,161
-My lady!

264
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:43,995
-Ha!

265
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,205
That's what I'm talking about!

266
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,166
-Don't you want to
hear the details?

267
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,168
[sigh]

268
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,420
-You sure about this, my lady?

269
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,965
-As much as I hate to admit
it, Jiraiya was right.

270
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:56,466
-Hmm?

271
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,263
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Apologies, Tsunade.

272
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,141
Naruto still has
much to learn, but I

273
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:08,102
must respond to some
urgent information.

274
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,104
He can proceed without me.

275
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,357
I leave him in your care.

276
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:12,941
Ha.

277
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,192
I'll be honest.

278
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,361
Naruto is still
kind of an idiot,

279
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,697
but he has the unique
power to change people.

280
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,367
And someday, he'll change, too.

281
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:26,704
Into something bigger
than you or me.

282
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,082
Tsunade, a person
grows up when he's

283
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,334
forced to overcome hardships.

284
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,045
Protection is important,
but there are some things

285
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,673
that a person must
learn on his own.

286
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,215
Ha.

287
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,091
Don't worry.

288
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,718
He got his guts
from yours truly.

289
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,681
So someday, when he asks,
I hope you'll trust him.

290
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,894
-Master Jiraiya.

291
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,522
-Yamato and Kakashi will
be on the team with him.

292
00:12:56,359 --> 00:13:00,488
And besides, Naruto
is not a kid anymore.

293
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:05,702
-I've got to use that new
jutsu for this mission.

294
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,160
Ah.

295
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,712
A place to call home.

296
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,470
-Find anything?

297
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,221
-No.

298
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,222
Nothing.

299
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,849
-Me neither.

300
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,727
-Well, what do we do now?

301
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,854
We mustn't lose
track of our enemy.

302
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:37,567
If we can't pick up their trail,
we won't get another chance.

303
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,069
-And since they obviously
know about us by now,

304
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:43,197
the chances of getting in a
fight are pretty much certain.

305
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,574
-That's true.

306
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,785
But for the moment, we'd be
better off avoiding a battle.

307
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,495
-It all points to one thing.

308
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,414
We have to find these
guys right away.

309
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:55,335
-Hmm.

310
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,380
Kiba.

311
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,382
You think you can sniff
out the bats' scent?

312
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,301
-Huh?

313
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:08,723
[wood rattling]

314
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,641
-Ah!

315
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,603
[giggling]

316
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,481
-You should have seen it-- huh?

317
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,441
-I have something
to take care of.

318
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,817
You wait here.

319
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,110
-Huh?

320
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,988
-I'll come back to get
you when I'm finished.

321
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,531
And don't go running off again.

322
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:29,118
Lord Orochimaru asked
me to look after you.

323
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,745
-You wait here, dear.

324
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,288
I'll come back to get you.

325
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:46,844
-Ah!

326
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,971
My mom!

327
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,182
When my mother left,
she never came back.

328
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,767
-What?

329
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,812
-I wanted to see a red camellia.

330
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,648
But it wasn't the right one.

331
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:02,193
It was a white camellia instead.

332
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,654
Now everyone's gone.

333
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,990
-GUREN (VOICEOVER): Is he
talking about his hometown?

335
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,245
-Here.

336
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:12,745
-Wait.

337
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,038
That's--

338
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,873
-I have this one now.

339
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,250
-I don't know.

340
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:17,959
-Take it.

341
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:21,003
It's for you, Guren.

342
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,506
-You want to exchange it, right?

343
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,382
OK.

344
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:24,882
-Hmm.

345
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,680
-You're telling me you want to
master a new jutsu right now?

346
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,098
It just can't be done.

347
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,141
It's impossible.

348
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,434
-I don't care if it is.

349
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,018
I don't have any other choice.

350
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,145
-You're crazy.

351
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,855
Let's go home, Gamatatsu.

352
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,523
-Hey, wait!

353
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:41,899
Listen.

354
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,652
I can't let this mission happen
without being a part of it.

355
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,029
I can't go without this jutsu.

356
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,533
And I won't know the
jutsu without your help.

357
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:54,162
-TOAD (VOICEOVER): There
he goes, being all serious.

358
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:54,996
-Fine.

359
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,081
But you'll owe us.

360
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,082
-Yeah!

361
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,959
Now that's the son
of the Chief Toad.

362
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,085
-Hmm.

363
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,670
How we going to do this?

364
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,172
In such a short period?

365
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,631
-Ah, we'll work it out.

366
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,092
-My wind chakra and
Gamatatsu's water.

367
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,470
That's all we need.

368
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,890
-We have to somehow get both
your jutsus to collaborate.

369
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,267
Hmm.

370
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,560
Right.

371
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,396
This'll be a bit on the
harsh side, but we'll try it.

372
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,355
-You mean it?

373
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,232
You have some kind of idea?

374
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,025
-You.

375
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,735
Hop into Gamatatsu's mouth.

376
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:30,281
-Uh--

377
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,658
-What?

378
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,576
-Now wait a minute.

379
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,620
Why do I have to
go into his mouth?

380
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,497
-He looks like he's
going to taste bad.

381
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,915
I don't want him on my tongue.

382
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,333
-What did you say?

383
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,667
-Stop arguing.

384
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,920
It's the only way this'll work.

385
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,881
Besides, you still have
to earn all those snacks

386
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:47,965
you got the other day.

387
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,134
Where's your sense of duty?

388
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,094
-Mmm, my duty, huh?

389
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,055
Well, I guess I have to do it.

390
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,265
-But why do I have
to be in his mouth?

391
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:59,477
-There's no time to explain.

392
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,731
-NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Boy, is this unpleasant.

393
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:04,273
-All right.

394
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,274
Are we ready?

395
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,400
-Yuck.

396
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,111
What kind of ridiculous
gooey training is this?

397
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,198
-Under these conditions, you
can collaborate on your jutsu.

398
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,449
-You're kidding me.

399
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,035
-It will force you to be
aware of each other's power

400
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,662
and work in harmony.

401
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,456
It's like they say, nothing
ventured, nothing gained.

402
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,959
Unless you venture
into a frog's mouth.

403
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,378
-This sounds like a
load of baloney to me.

404
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,673
And I don't even think
Gamatatsu has a jutsu.

405
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,216
-Hey.

406
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,510
The more you complain, the
more time you're wasting.

407
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,388
-Ugh, you're right.

408
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,138
-Now concentrate.

409
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,774
-I've picked up a
scent, Kakashi-sensei.

410
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,818
It's coming from our 2 o'clock.

411
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:49,944
-Got it.

412
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,696
Then we'll take a detour.

413
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,156
-Understood.

414
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,659
-You mean you think we can
slip past the bats' formation

415
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,327
unseen, then, huh?

416
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,455
-Bats can only sense things
a limited distance away.

417
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,916
There's lots of obstacles
to shield us in the woods.

418
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,002
If we keep far enough
from them, they'll

419
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,838
have a hard time
pinning us down.

420
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,172
-I see.

421
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,217
-Then again, we can't get
completely out of their search

422
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,344
area, or they'll get suspicious.

-Huh?

426
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,214
It's bad luck to say that.

427
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,383
Come on, you honestly
think that I'll die?

428
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:03,392
-So, Naruto found out
about the mission.

429
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,226
-I'm sorry.

430
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,728
-It's OK, Sai.

431
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:06,771
Really.

432
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,939
I didn't think we'd
be able to hide it.

433
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,984
-I had no idea he'd go
straight to the Hokage.

434
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:15,488
-Lady Tsunade is not a person
who gives in to pressure.

435
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,407
She made the decision to
allow him to come along.

436
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,201
It had nothing to do with you.

437
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,577
-See?

438
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,788
In fact, it'll actually help,
because teammates communicate

439
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,247
better with each other.

440
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,834
But then again, Naruto
is late as always.

441
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,878
What's he doing?

442
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,463

00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,297
Yeeeow.

-Ugh.

-Oh, man.

much more of this.

Don't throw in the towel yet.

-Yep.

455
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,235
Looks like this is the
right way to do it.

456

-Haha.

What's our strategy?

-If we take out one of
them, reduce their numbers,

that ought to improve
the odds a bit.

-And after that?

-I'd like to say we wipe
the floor with them,

to hold them long enough
