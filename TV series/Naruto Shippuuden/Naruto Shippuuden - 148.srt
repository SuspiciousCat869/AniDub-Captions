You see him?

3
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,052
It's that boy.

4
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:36,588
I heard he's the
only one who failed.

00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:37,555
-Hmm.

00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:39,024
{\an1}Well, it serves him right.

7
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:41,761
{\an1}It would be terrible it someone
like him became a ninja.

8
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:43,094
I mean, come on.

9
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:43,895
{\an1}He's the boy who--

10
00:00:43,928 --> 00:00:44,929
-Shh.

11
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:46,097
{\an1}We're not allowed
to talk about that.

Hey, Tonbei.

25
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:22,823
You knew.

-What?

30
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,501
{\an1}The forbidden jutsu
is in that girl?

{\an1}It was my grandfather who--

34
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:49,416
{\an1}-You served Hotaru's
grandfather for years and years,

35
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:50,585
didn't you?

36
00:03:50,618 --> 00:03:52,753
{\an1}So why didn't you prevent
him from doing this?

37
00:03:52,787 --> 00:03:55,088

of that jutsu that you're--

-I asked for it.

44
00:04:09,135 --> 00:04:12,573
{\an1}I asked to be given
the forbidden jutsu.

45

{\an1}-Lady Hotaru, please.

46
00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:19,647
-But why?

47
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,315
{\an1}Why would you do such a thing?

48
00:04:35,663 --> 00:04:36,330
-Tonbei.

00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:39,066
{\an1}I'm glad you're safe.

50
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,237
{\an1}-I should be the one saying
that to you, Lady Hotaru.

00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:45,439
All of you from
the Leaf village.

Sir Utakata.

53

{\an1}Words can't express how grateful
I am for what you've done.

54
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:54,582
{\an1}-Don't mention it, but you
should know that the Tsuchigumo

55
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:57,118
{\an1}village was under
the bandits' control.

56
00:04:57,151 --> 00:04:58,754
{\an1}-Oh, I understand now.

57
00:04:58,787 --> 00:05:00,756
{\an1}That's why you came back.

58
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:01,990
-Yes.

59
00:05:02,024 --> 00:05:03,558
{\an1}-Never mind all that.

60
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:06,327
{\an1}Just finish what you
were telling us earlier.

61
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,230
{\an1}-About the forbidden jutsu.

62
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:10,732
-Go on.

63
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:12,300
-That jutsu.

64
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,102
It was part of
grandfather's dream.

65
00:05:15,136 --> 00:05:15,804
-En no Gyoja?

66
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:21,409
-The Tsuchigumo
clan was once one

67
00:05:21,443 --> 00:05:23,779
{\an1}of the proudest in
all the nations.

68
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:25,981
{\an1}With our powerful
forbidden jutsu,

69
00:05:26,014 --> 00:05:29,150
{\an1}it was said we could even tip
the balance of the Great Ninja

70
00:05:29,183 --> 00:05:30,084
War.

71
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:32,354
But at the same
time, other clans

72
00:05:32,387 --> 00:05:35,591
{\an1}often targeted ours because
we possessed that jutsu.

73
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:39,394
{\an1}And so, one life after
another was lost.

74
00:05:39,428 --> 00:05:42,497
{\an1}-When the Great War
was over, only a few

75
00:05:42,531 --> 00:05:46,568
{\an1}remained who were capable of
wielding the forbidden jutsu.

76
00:05:46,602 --> 00:05:49,972
{\an1}Also, Lord En no Gyoja and
some of the village elders

77
00:05:50,005 --> 00:05:53,675
{\an1}had disagreements over what
our clan's future should be.

78
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:56,845
{\an1}And that led to the clan
splitting into two factions,

79
00:05:56,878 --> 00:05:59,348
{\an1}with one group settling
in the Tsuchigumo village,

80
00:05:59,381 --> 00:06:02,986
and the other in
Mount Katsuragi.

81
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:05,654
{\an1}But by then, Lord En
no Gyoja was already

82
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:08,156
{\an1}quite advanced in
years, so few people

83
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,060
{\an1}opted to follow him when he
left for Mount Katsuragi.

84
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:17,733
-Hotaru.

85
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:19,501
It's up to you.

86
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:22,404
{\an1}The future of our clan
is in your hands now.

87
00:06:32,882 --> 00:06:33,850
-Grandfather!

88
00:06:33,883 --> 00:06:38,387
[crying]

89
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,256
{\an1}-Grandfather believed that
restoring the Tsuchigumo clan's

90
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:43,358
{\an1}name was the key.

91
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:46,763
{\an1}Our name was the way to
make amends and bring honor

92
00:06:46,796 --> 00:06:49,297
{\an1}to those who lost their lives
for the forbidden jutsu.

93
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:56,372
{\an1}So that's why I must carry
out the wish of my grandfather

94
00:06:56,406 --> 00:06:58,074
and master.

95
00:06:58,107 --> 00:07:00,009
-How foolish.

96
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:00,510
-Huh?

97
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:05,415
{\an1}-That's why you had the
forbidden jutsu embedded

98
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:07,450
inside you?

99
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:08,384
For your master?

100
00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:09,585
For your clan?

101
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:10,920
So senseless.

102
00:07:10,953 --> 00:07:12,321
{\an1}-Believe what you want.

103
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:16,060
{\an1}It's a student's duty to carry
out the wishes of her master.

104
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:16,559
-Hotaru.

105
00:07:21,497 --> 00:07:26,602
{\an1}-I just don't think that you
really understand how I feel.

106
00:07:26,636 --> 00:07:28,038
-Lady Hotaru.

107
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:31,841
{\an1}I think Sir Utakata may
be right about this.

108
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,210
-Tonbei?

109
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:37,014
{\an1}-It's clear to me that the
Tsuchigumo clan no longer

110
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:40,017
{\an1}has the strength to keep
the forbidden jutsu safe.

111
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,053
{\an1}If it were used for the
wrong purposes, Lord En

112
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,690
{\an1}no Gyoja's legacy would be
tarnished beyond repair.

113
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:49,126
To prevent its
misuse, I believe we

114
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,327
{\an1}have no choice but to
destroy the forbidden jutsu

115
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,329
{\an1}while we still can.

116
00:07:53,362 --> 00:07:55,733
-Destroy it?

117
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,234
{\an1}-And just how do you
propose to do that?

118
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:01,772
{\an1}The forbidden jutsu is still
inside Hotaru's body, remember?

119
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:02,773
Wait!

120
00:08:02,806 --> 00:08:03,540
You mean--

121
00:08:03,574 --> 00:08:05,609
{\an1}-Don't misunderstand me.

122
00:08:05,642 --> 00:08:07,878
[groans]

123
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:10,614
-Mr. Tonbei, you
shouldn't move around.

124
00:08:10,647 --> 00:08:11,280
-Don't worry.

125
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:11,982
I'll be fine.

126
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:26,196
-What is this?

127
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:30,968
{\an1}-A scroll that Lord En no
Gyoja entrusted to me long ago.

128
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:33,537
{\an1}It contains the method
for how we may safely

129
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:38,109
{\an1}remove the forbidden jutsu
from Lady Hotaru's body.

130
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,878
{\an1}-So there really is
a way to take it out?

131
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:43,380
{\an1}-The great Lord En
no Gyoja would never

132
00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:46,850
{\an1}have embedded it in her body
if there hadn't been a way

133
00:08:46,884 --> 00:08:49,486
{\an1}to remove it once it
had been implanted.

134
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,321
{\an1}What kind of master
would even think

135
00:08:51,355 --> 00:08:55,160
{\an1}of doing such a dreadful thing?

136
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:56,928
{\an1}Please forgive me.

137
00:08:56,961 --> 00:08:59,798
{\an1}I should have told you
this long before now.

138
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,133
{\an1}But once the forbidden
jutsu is removed

139
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:07,071
{\an1}from inside Lady Hotaru, it
will no longer have any power.

140
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:10,942
{\an1}I had also longed to
restore our clan's glory.

141
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:14,746
{\an1}Without the forbidden jutsu, I
know that dream will fade away.

142
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:18,283
{\an1}But still, this is
how it should be.

143
00:09:18,315 --> 00:09:19,449
-No, it's not.

144
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:20,251
-Please.

145
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:21,586
{\an1}I'm going to need your help.

146
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:25,355
{\an1}I can't remove the jutsu
from Lady Hotaru by myself.

147
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:27,192
{\an1}There's just one problem.

148
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:29,460
{\an1}We can't make that
decision by ourselves.

149
00:09:29,494 --> 00:09:31,696
{\an1}-Then hurry and send a
message to Grandma Tsunade

150
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:32,864
{\an1}to get permission.

151
00:09:32,897 --> 00:09:35,066
{\an1}I mean, we can't leave
Hotaru like this.

152
00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:36,835
-Just hold on.

153
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,870
{\an1}I haven't decided if
I'm going to give up

154
00:09:38,903 --> 00:09:40,238
{\an1}the forbidden jutsu yet.

155
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:42,308
{\an1}-But Lady Hotaru, please.

156
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,143
{\an1}If we don't do this,
then not only the jutsu,

157
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:46,544
{\an1}but your life will be in peril.

158
00:09:46,578 --> 00:09:49,948
{\an1}-But it's my life to risk!

159
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:52,917
[slap]

160
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,690
{\an1}-Just knock it off.

161
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,160
-Sir Utakata.

162
00:10:01,193 --> 00:10:04,529
{\an1}-Ah-- I-- I'm sorry.

163
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,497
{\an1}-Do you know what
you're asking me?

164
00:10:06,531 --> 00:10:07,565
Do you?

165
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:11,203
{\an1}I can't abandon my
clan's pride and honor.

166
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:12,271
-Hey, wait.

167
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:14,873
-Don't, Naruto.

168
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:15,440
-Don't worry.

169
00:10:15,473 --> 00:10:17,675
I'll get her.

170
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:20,045
{\an1}-My dear Lady Hotaru.

171
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,813
{\an1}-I'll go and convince her.

172
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:23,249
-Not so fast.

173
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:26,417
We can't let you
just wander off.

174
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:28,453
{\an1}-She couldn't have
gotten too far.

175
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:29,889
{\an1}I'll be right back.

176
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:33,025
{\an1}I'd never put Hotaru
in any danger.

177
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:34,860
{\an1}-Very well, then.

178
00:10:34,894 --> 00:10:36,795
{\an1}Sakura, you go with him.

179
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:38,197
-Right.

180
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,665
{\an1}-But shouldn't I go?

181
00:10:39,698 --> 00:10:41,333
{\an1}I'd be better at finding her.

182
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:43,235
{\an1}-Just hold tight.

183
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:45,271
{\an1}There's something else
that I want you to do.

184
00:10:45,304 --> 00:10:45,905
-Yes, sir.

185
00:10:55,147 --> 00:10:56,115
{\an1}-Oh, Grandfather.

186
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:00,719
-Hotaru.

187
00:11:00,753 --> 00:11:02,421
{\an1}Take a good look.

188
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:05,591
{\an1}Once, not long ago, the
Tsuchigumo clan's name

189
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,227
{\an1}was known far beyond
those mountains.

190
00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:12,131
{\an1}Everything you see was
once part of our lands.

191
00:11:12,164 --> 00:11:13,432
{\an1}-Our clan was grand.

192
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:16,269
{\an1}Wasn't it, Grandfather?

193
00:11:16,303 --> 00:11:18,171
Huh?

194
00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:19,605
{\an1}Hey, what's the matter?

195
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,507
{\an1}Why are you crying?

196
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,145
{\an1}-All of our power and
greatness faded under my rule.

197
00:11:25,178 --> 00:11:29,249
{\an1}If I hadn't been the leader,
would the clan have faltered?

198
00:11:42,795 --> 00:11:43,897
-So.

199
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,800
{\an1}I take it this is your
grandfather's grave.

200
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,336
{\an1}I found those growing nearby.

201
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:50,103
{\an1}-Thank you, Naruto.

202
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:52,238
That was nice.

203
00:11:52,272 --> 00:11:54,240
-Boy, he's got a
pretty nice view.

204
00:11:54,274 --> 00:11:56,176
{\an1}I bet he's really
happy to be up here.

205
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,682
{\an1}But you know what?

206
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:05,418
{\an1}I bet he's pretty
worried about you, too.

207
00:12:05,452 --> 00:12:06,419
-He's right.

208
00:12:06,453 --> 00:12:07,354
{\an1}Let's go back, Hotaru.

209
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,624
-Sir Utakata.

210
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:20,434
-Well, come on.

211
00:12:20,468 --> 00:12:23,069
Let's go.

212
00:12:23,103 --> 00:12:25,305
{\an1}-But I haven't decided.

213
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:28,442
{\an1}-If your wish is truly to
restore your clan's glory,

214
00:12:28,476 --> 00:12:32,380
{\an1}you don't need to rely on
something like that to do it.

215
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:36,417
{\an1}Possessing too much power only
gives rise to great suffering.

216
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:43,357
{\an1}(VOICEOVER) I'm a prime example.

217
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:50,297
Right, Naruto?

218
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:52,632
-Huh?

219
00:12:52,665 --> 00:12:53,467
{\an1}-I know another way.

220
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:55,236
{\an1}And someone who can help.

221
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:55,735
-Really?

222
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:57,371
Who?

223
00:12:57,405 --> 00:12:59,240
{\an1}-A man named Shiranami.

224
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:02,043
{\an1}He's from the Tsuchigumo clan.

225
00:13:02,076 --> 00:13:06,047
{\an1}And he-- he can wield
the forbidden jutsu.

226
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,282
{\an1}-You know this guy?

227
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:10,317
-He was once
grandfather's student.

228
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:12,820
{\an1}-En no Gyoja's student.

229
00:13:12,853 --> 00:13:15,289
{\an1}-Or, more accurately,
he was a student

230
00:13:15,322 --> 00:13:17,557
{\an1}or grandfather's student.

231
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,995
{\an1}It was Shiranami's father,
a man named Sir Hato,

232
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:24,265
{\an1}who was the very first
pupil my grandfather taught.

233
00:13:24,298 --> 00:13:27,234
{\an1}I've heard that Sir Hato
was a brilliant student who

234
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:29,503
{\an1}had exceptional ninjutsu skills.

235
00:13:29,537 --> 00:13:32,673
{\an1}And it was said that his
son, Shiranami, possessed

236
00:13:32,706 --> 00:13:34,543
{\an1}even greater skill
than his father.

237
00:13:37,244 --> 00:13:40,648
{\an1}But during the Great Ninja
War, Sir Hato unfortunately

238
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:44,652
{\an1}was killed because he was trying
to protect the forbidden jutsu.

239
00:13:44,685 --> 00:13:48,055
{\an1}My grandfather sensed that
Shiranami was also in danger,

240
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:51,460
{\an1}and had him sent away from
the village to keep him safe.

241
00:13:51,493 --> 00:13:54,161
{\an1}Grandfather often
said, when I was young,

242
00:13:54,195 --> 00:13:57,631
{\an1}that if those two men were
still here with us today,

243
00:13:57,665 --> 00:14:00,469
{\an1}this village wouldn't have
fallen as far as it has.

244
00:14:03,305 --> 00:14:06,941
{\an1}-If this Shiranami guy can help
you, then we need to find him.

245
00:14:06,974 --> 00:14:08,843
{\an1}You have any idea where he is?

246
00:14:08,876 --> 00:14:10,611
-I'm not sure.

247
00:14:10,644 --> 00:14:11,480
-Look.

248
00:14:11,513 --> 00:14:12,980
Sooner or later,
those bandits are

249
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:14,748
{\an1}going to come right back here.

250
00:14:14,782 --> 00:14:17,352
{\an1}We simply don't have enough
time to look for him.

251
00:14:17,385 --> 00:14:18,553
{\an1}So decide, Hotaru.

252
00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:23,558
-Hey, wait.

253
00:14:23,592 --> 00:14:25,360
{\an1}I just had a great idea.

254
00:14:25,393 --> 00:14:26,760
{\an1}I'll go out there and find him.

255
00:14:26,794 --> 00:14:27,596
{\an1}-What do you mean?

256
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:30,031
{\an1}You can't just go running off.

257
00:14:30,065 --> 00:14:33,734
{\an1}-You know, Hotaru, the thing
is, I'm sort of in a situation

258
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:35,604
{\an1}just like the one you're in now.

259
00:14:35,636 --> 00:14:37,539
{\an1}-I don't understand.

260
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:38,940
{\an1}-Naruto, be quiet.

261
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,112
-I can't go into
all the details.

262
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:45,680
But deep down,
we're a lot alike.

263
00:14:45,714 --> 00:14:49,584
{\an1}I have a secret that gives
me a lot of trouble, too.

264
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:51,486
{\an1}But now I don't feel
like I have to carry

265
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,489
{\an1}the whole weight of it, because
I have my friends near me.

266
00:14:54,523 --> 00:14:57,292
{\an1}People like Sakura
and old Pervy Sage.

267
00:14:57,325 --> 00:14:59,261
{\an1}I've got tell you, Hotaru.

268
00:14:59,294 --> 00:15:01,531
{\an1}You're an awfully strong girl.

269
00:15:01,564 --> 00:15:04,099
{\an1}You chose to take this
trouble on yourself,

270
00:15:04,132 --> 00:15:06,435
{\an1}and you've suffered
with it all alone.

271
00:15:06,469 --> 00:15:09,204
{\an1}All this time, you've
carried your clan's future

272
00:15:09,237 --> 00:15:12,707
{\an1}and your grandpa's
dream on your shoulders.

273
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:14,477
And that's why I
want to help you.

274
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,078
{\an1}I want to see your
dreams come true.

275
00:15:17,112 --> 00:15:19,515
{\an1}So if I could find
this Shiranami guy,

276
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:22,184
{\an1}then you'll have another
ally by your side.

277
00:15:22,218 --> 00:15:24,554
{\an1}You won't have to bear all
this weight by yourself.

278
00:15:24,587 --> 00:15:28,324
{\an1}And you-- you won't have to
suffer all alone anymore.

279
00:15:28,357 --> 00:15:30,193
-But Naruto--

280
00:15:30,226 --> 00:15:30,926
-Don't worry.

281
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,562
{\an1}Just leave it to me.

282
00:15:32,595 --> 00:15:35,797
{\an1}I'll go and find him, or my
name isn't Naruto Uzumaki.

283
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:40,269
{\an1}Give me, let's say, one day.

284
00:15:40,303 --> 00:15:42,038
{\an1}Two at the absolute most.

285
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:43,506
{\an1}I'll find Shiranami for you.

286
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:44,106
I promise.

287
00:15:54,217 --> 00:15:55,151
[laughter]

288
00:15:55,184 --> 00:15:56,751
{\an1}-What a surprise.

289
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:58,287
{\an1}Never in a million
years would I have

290
00:15:58,321 --> 00:16:00,623
{\an1}guessed that my name would
come up in this conversation.

291
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:15,104
[cough]

292
00:16:15,137 --> 00:16:15,606
-Oh.

293
00:16:20,776 --> 00:16:21,645
{\an1}-What does it say?

294
00:16:21,678 --> 00:16:25,348
{\an1}Is there some kind of trouble?

295
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:25,948
-Of course.

296
00:16:25,982 --> 00:16:27,316
I see.

297
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,620
{\an1}The situation's pretty much
what I thought it would be.

298
00:16:36,526 --> 00:16:38,127
{\an1}-What will you do now?

299
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,062
{\an1}-It will be extremely
dangerous to keep

300
00:16:40,096 --> 00:16:41,964
{\an1}the forbidden jutsu intact.

301
00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:43,099
-That's true.

302
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:45,134
{\an1}But it says that they
want to keep the jutsu,

303
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:49,772
{\an1}and then have us guard the
girl here in the Hidden Leaf.

304
00:16:49,805 --> 00:16:52,108
{\an1}-Without a doubt, we have
to keep the forbidden jutsu

305
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:54,877
{\an1}from falling into the hands of
anyone not bound by the treaty.

306
00:16:58,582 --> 00:16:59,716
{\an1}-What was I thinking?

307
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,319
{\an1}I acted like finding
this guy was no big deal,

308
00:17:02,352 --> 00:17:04,621
but I don't even
know where to start.

309
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:06,556
{\an1}Well, no use crying
about it now.

310
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,626
{\an1}I need a strength-in-numbers
approach here.

311
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,793
{\an1}Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

312
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:18,769
{\an1}-Naruto has what?

313
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:22,005
{\an1}-If Shiranami does return,
that would certainly help.

314
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:25,042
{\an1}-But can Naruto find
him in just two days?

315
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:27,144
{\an1}-We may not even have that long.

316
00:17:27,177 --> 00:17:29,714
{\an1}If those bandits attack again
before Naruto gets back,

317
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:33,216
{\an1}then it may not even matter
if Shiranami returns.

318
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,052
{\an1}-Yeah, you're right.

319
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:37,487
{\an1}So we'll prepare just in case.

320
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:41,158
{\an1}We should get ready to
remove the forbidden jutsu.

321
00:17:41,191 --> 00:17:43,827
{\an1}You understand, Hotaru?

322
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,162
-Yes.

323
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:48,700
{\an1}-It looks like the [inaudible]
jutsu uses a special potion

324
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:49,801
to work.

325
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,102
{\an1}Sakura, I'm putting
you in charge of that.

326
00:17:52,135 --> 00:17:54,304
{\an1}Make sure the potion
is properly mixed.

327
00:17:54,338 --> 00:17:54,871
-I understand.

328
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:09,086
{\an1}-The great Lord En
no Gyoja would never

329
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,557
{\an1}have embedded it in her body
it there hadn't been a way

330
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,393
{\an1}to remove it once it
had been implanted.

331
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:17,060
{\an1}What kind of master
would even think

332
00:18:17,094 --> 00:18:18,796
{\an1}of doing such a dreadful thing?

333
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,968
[gasp]

334
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:25,803
-Master.

335
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:26,304
No!

336
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:33,044
-No, Utakata.

337
00:18:33,077 --> 00:18:34,212
You're wrong.

338
00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:35,947
Harusame did not
try to kill you.

339
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,582
{\an1}You must believe me.

340
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:40,251
{\an1}It wasn't like that at all.

341
00:18:40,284 --> 00:18:41,619
{\an1}(VOICEOVER) Could it be?

342
00:18:41,652 --> 00:18:44,857
{\an1}Did Tsurugi really
speak the truth?

343
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:49,994
{\an1}If so, then what was Master
Harusame trying to do to me?

344
00:18:50,027 --> 00:18:51,730
{\an1}I must speak to Tsurugi again.

345
00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:02,173
{\an1}-Hey, I'm looking for
someone named Shiranami.

346
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:05,677
{\an1}Have you guys ever heard of him?

347
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,613
{\an1}So, do you know anybody
named Shiranami?

348
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,016
I see.

349
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:13,619
{\an1}You don't know him.

350
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,155
{\an1}Anything would help.

351
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:22,561
{\an1}-OK, but if you do see him, tell
me, Naruto of the Hidden Leaf.

{\an1}[gasps and groans]

I used up all my
chakra and I still

355
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,071
{\an1}don't have a clue where he is.

356
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:35,139
{\an1}-What's the matter?

357
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:36,408
-Hm?

358
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,777
{\an1}-Why are you sitting
there in the road?

359
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,846
-Oh, ah-- I'm
looking for someone

360
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,648
{\an1}and I can't seem to find him.

361
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,916
-I see.

362
00:19:43,948 --> 00:19:45,117
{\an1}Who you are looking for?

363
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,454
{\an1}-Oh, just some guy
named Shiranami.

364
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,489
-Shiranami, huh?

365
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:50,988
Oh, yeah.

366
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,391
That man.

367
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:53,292
-For real?

368
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,026
Are you sure?

369
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,462
{\an1}Do you really know him?

370
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:57,596
-I do.

371
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,498
{\an1}There's a man by that
name who lives in a hut

372
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,266
by the waterfall
over that mountain.

373
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,903
{\an1}I'm pretty sure that he does
some kind of ninja training

374
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:05,971
{\an1}there, or at least that's
what he used to do.

375
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,907
{\an1}-So he's just over
that mountain?

376
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:09,876
Thanks, old guy!

377
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:11,310
{\an1}I knew I could find him.

378
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,458
{\an1}-Oh, don't tell me.

379
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,962
{\an1}Sir Utakata has really
gone off for good?

380
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,505
{\an1}-(VOICEOVER) Come
on out, Tsurugi.

381
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:41,240
{\an1}You're going to tell me what
I wasn't ready to hear before.

382
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:59,692
{\an1}-Utakata is on the move.

383
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:00,894
-I see.

384
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:04,764
I wonder, is he
trying to lure me in?

385
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:05,632
Let's go.

386
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:06,366
-Yes, sir.

387
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:19,212
[growling]

388
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:21,180
-What's that?

00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:25,652

I mean

394
00:22:57,144 --> 00:22:57,812
-Yes!

395
00:22:57,846 --> 00:22:59,213
{\an1}I finally got a lead!

396
00:22:59,246 --> 00:23:00,782
This Shiranami
was supposed to be

397
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:03,550
{\an1}a skilled ninja from
the Tsuchigumo clan.

398
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:05,452
{\an1}So if there's a guy
training on the other side

399
00:23:05,486 --> 00:23:09,289
{\an1}of the mountains, he's got to be
the one Hotaru is looking for.

400
00:23:09,323 --> 00:23:13,160
{\an1}Looks like I'll make it back by
the time I promised, after all.

401
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:15,096
{\an1}Just hang tight, Hotaru.

402
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,599
{\an1}I'll bring him home to you soon.

403
00:23:17,632 --> 00:23:22,070
{\an1}Next time on Naruto
Shippuden-- Separation.

404
00:23:22,103 --> 00:23:24,673
{\an1}I've been looking
for you, Shiranami.
