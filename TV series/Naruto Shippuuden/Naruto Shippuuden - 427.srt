1
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:55,673
{\an1}Just a little farther!

2
00:01:56,172 --> 00:01:57,841
{\an1}<i>(Tenten) With this, I can-!</i>

3
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:01,012
[scream]

4
00:02:07,084 --> 00:02:10,722
{\an1}With those two Ninja Tools, we
can seal the enemy in an
instant!

5
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,460
{\an1}But before we can, I need to ask
someone from the Cloud how to
use them!

6
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:17,195
Wha-?!

7
00:02:19,464 --> 00:02:20,966
{\an1}Heh!...Now! Become one!

8
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:44,158
{\an1}<i>(Tenten) I...can't...move...</i>

9
00:03:17,494 --> 00:03:19,663
{\an1}<i>(Tenten) No...! I have to...</i>

10
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:37,382
{\an1}I have to save everyone before
it's too late!

11
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:40,486
Wait, huh-?!

12
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:43,355
Huh?

13
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,803
{\an1}I don't know how, but this is my
room, right...?

14
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,620
{\an1}The Hidden Leaf Village...

15
00:04:18,894 --> 00:04:19,861
{\an1}Wait, but how...?

16
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:29,171
{\an1}Does this mean that I was
transported here from the
battlefield?!

17
00:04:32,742 --> 00:04:34,710
[chattering]

18
00:04:34,744 --> 00:04:36,712
[panting]

19
00:04:39,348 --> 00:04:44,421
{\an4}If I was brought back here, what
happened to everybody else? I've
gotta find somebody that I can
ask!

20
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:47,089
{\an1}Yeah, I'm doing great! How 'bout
you?

21
00:04:47,123 --> 00:04:49,126
{\an1}Can we go to get some ice cream?
Please?!

22
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,931
{\an1}<i>(Tenten) Hold on...What is this</i>
<i>feeling...?</i>

23
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:55,800
[laughter]

24
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:56,668
PORK BUNS

25
00:04:56,701 --> 00:04:58,035
{\an1}Here you go! Enjoy them!

26
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,610
{\an1}I may not be on the battlefield
anymore, but, still,...it's way
too peaceful here...

27
00:05:05,643 --> 00:05:06,444
{\an1}<i>(Rock Lee) Tenten!</i>

28
00:05:06,912 --> 00:05:07,479
Huh?

29
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:09,347
{\an1}<i>(Guy) Ah! There you are!</i>

30
00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:10,783
{\an1}Oh, thank goodness!

31
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:14,587
{\an1}Guy Sensei, you and Lee got
transported here, too?

32
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,387
<i>(Tenten) Huh?!</i>

33
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:23,597
{\an1}Like a new comet, I am Rock Lee,
the fashion trendsetter of the
Hidden Leaf!

34
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:23,964
[chattering]

35
00:05:24,598 --> 00:05:25,499
{\an1}Coolly making my entrance!

36
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:26,700
Nope, no good!

37
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:29,603
{\an1}I'm sorry, but that was no good!

38
00:05:29,836 --> 00:05:32,205
{\an1}But, why? What was wrong with
it, Sensei?

39
00:05:32,606 --> 00:05:36,209
{\an1}A true fashion trendsetter
doesn't say such things, he
elicits them from others!

40
00:05:37,077 --> 00:05:40,681
{\an1}Remember, adults must always
conduct themselves in a cool
manner, Lee.

41
00:05:40,948 --> 00:05:43,584
{\an1}I will be more careful! Thanks,
Sensei!

42
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:45,654
{\an1}That is the power of style!

43
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:46,788
{\an1}Hold it right there!

44
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,091
{\an1}What's with you?! At a time like
this?! What is happening?!

45
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:51,426
{\an1}Time like this...?

46
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:53,529
{\an1}<i>(Tenten) Yeah! We're in the</i>
<i>middle of a war!</i>

47
00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:56,532
{\an1}This is not the time to be
joking around, my friends!

48
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:59,903
{\an1}But, Tenten...What are you even
talking about?!

49
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:03,806
{\an1}If you're referring to the Third
Great Ninja War, it ended a long
time ago.

50
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,410
{\an1}Just snap out of it. You're not
helping things by playing the
fool.

51
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,180
{\an1}Well, from my standpoint, you
are the one who needs to snap
out of it.

52
00:06:11,548 --> 00:06:12,181
What?!

53
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:14,217
{\an1}<i>(Neji) He's right, Tenten.</i>

54
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:16,921
{\an1}It seems to me that you need to
wake up!

55
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:18,556
[gasp] No way!

56
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:20,324
{\an1}But that voice is...!

57
00:06:20,891 --> 00:06:23,594
{\an1}You keep insisting on wearing
those ugly sports bras!

58
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:27,331
{\an1}It's time for you to wake up and
go put on some "better"
underwear!

59
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:30,435
{\an1}Huh?! Ugly sports bra? What...?

60
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:32,370
{\an1}(Tenten) [shriek]

61
00:06:33,204 --> 00:06:35,373
{\an1}<i>Why would he-? What is going</i>
<i>on?!</i>

62
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,078
{\an1}That was completely uncool! You
do not have any sense of style
at all, Neji!

63
00:06:40,345 --> 00:06:43,449
{\an1}Ugh! This is all just a part of
discipline and training!

64
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:46,519
{\an1}<i>(Tenten) You've got to be</i>
<i>kidding! Neji's acting like a</i>
<i>pervert!</i>

65
00:06:47,186 --> 00:06:53,192
{\an4}<i>(Tenten) Wait,...Neji is</i>
<i>supposed to be dead! So why are</i>
<i>Guy Sensei and Lee acting like</i>
<i>nothing happened?</i>

66
00:06:54,193 --> 00:06:56,195
{\an1}<i>(Menma) Hey, what's with all the</i>
<i>noise over here?</i>

67
00:06:57,197 --> 00:06:59,433
{\an1}Oh, perfect! You guys are just
in time!

68
00:07:00,068 --> 00:07:00,868
Huh?!

69
00:07:07,642 --> 00:07:08,710
Uh...

70
00:07:11,913 --> 00:07:16,785
{\an1}It is the usual issue...I hope
you will give Neji a good
scolding. Please, Menma!

71
00:07:17,485 --> 00:07:18,520
Huh?

72
00:07:19,253 --> 00:07:20,389
<i>(Tenten) Menma?!</i>

73
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:21,991
{\an1}Yeah? Is something wrong?

74
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:24,860
Well,...uh...

75
00:07:43,014 --> 00:07:46,117
{\an1}This is great! Barbecued meat is
the best!

76
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:50,788
{\an1}That's hardly the truth. Even if
it is dinnertime, I'd prefer
something much lighter.

77
00:07:51,023 --> 00:07:53,791
{\an1}Oh, you would? This feels pretty
light to me.

78
00:07:54,492 --> 00:07:56,628
{\an1}I don't think that's what
he was talking about...

79
00:07:56,862 --> 00:08:00,365
{\an1}<i>(Kiba) [laughter] You're always</i>
<i>such a fool!</i>

80
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:06,471
{\an1}Do you want more to eat? Hey,
Tenten?

81
00:08:06,505 --> 00:08:08,340
Huh? Oh. Yeah...

82
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:11,376
{\an1}<i>(Tenten) I came along to confirm</i>
<i>my suspicions, but...</i>

83
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:15,481
{\an1}I have to say, Neji, that your
dirty mind is still a really
serious problem.

84
00:08:15,748 --> 00:08:18,052
{\an1}Oh, I was merely trying to
discipline her!

85
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:19,519
{\an1}Quit makin' excuses!

86
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:22,056
{\an1}You're a freakin' disgrace to
our clan!

87
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:26,225
{\an1}Do that again and I'll rip your
eyes out! You'd better remember
that, you idiot!

88
00:08:26,493 --> 00:08:29,229
{\an1}Uh,...that's not a nice joke,
Lady Hinata.

89
00:08:29,563 --> 00:08:33,333
{\an1}Oh, that's so scary...I just
couldn't imagine doing something
like that.

90
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:37,472
{\an1}Hey! Don't use this as a chance
to get close to Menma or I will
kill you!

91
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:43,344
{\an1}Listen, Menma doesn't want your
kind of attention, all right?!
Just go away! Shoo! Shoo!

92
00:08:43,712 --> 00:08:45,047
No, you go away!

93
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:45,981
Shoo! Shoo!

94
00:08:46,347 --> 00:08:48,349
{\an1}You're both huge pains; just get
lost.

95
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,250
What?! Menma!

96
00:08:50,385 --> 00:08:52,253
{\an1}<i>(Sakura) Aw, don't be so</i>
<i>cold to me, Menma!</i>

97
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:55,357
{\an1}Hey, don't get so worked up. I
mean, you still have me!

98
00:08:55,725 --> 00:08:58,394
{\an1}Huh? I don't need a cheap flirt
like you!

99
00:08:59,162 --> 00:09:00,964
{\an1}Wow, talk about an overreaction.

100
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:04,266
{\an1}But, then again, that's what I
like about you, my kitten.

101
00:09:04,568 --> 00:09:08,538
{\an1}Oh, did someone say kitten?
They're so cute! Hey, I love all
cats!

102
00:09:09,207 --> 00:09:10,875
{\an1}<i>(Shino) No one's talking about</i>
<i>cats!</i>

103
00:09:13,211 --> 00:09:16,881
{\an4}<i>But what really concerns me,</i>
<i>right now, is the source of this</i>
<i>repulsive feeling I've been</i>
<i>having...</i>

104
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:19,717
<i>There it is!</i>

105
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,690
{\an1}<i>(Hinata) Hey, what the hell are</i>
<i>you doing?! We're trying to eat</i>
<i>here! </i>

106
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:33,398
{\an4}<i>Don't worry! This spray</i>
<i>is harmless to humans. But I</i>
<i>will show no mercy toward bugs,</i>
<i>not even teeny ones!</i>

107
00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:35,367
{\an1}That's not the problem here!

108
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:39,105
{\an1}[sigh] Thanks for the food.

109
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:41,574
{\an1}What? Are you leaving already?

110
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:44,210
{\an1}We're all splitting the bill, so
you should eat up!

111
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:49,816
{\an1}[sigh] Thanks, but I'm
feeling full. This is for my
share of the food.

112
00:09:53,386 --> 00:09:54,555
Hm.

[grunt]

120

{\an1}And it isn't a dream either...

121
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:33,597
{\an1}Wait, maybe...I could be trapped
inside a genjutsu, right now!

122
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:38,969
{\an1}Well, then I'll just have to
break out of it!

00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:40,604
Release!

isn't working at all!

129
00:10:56,721 --> 00:11:01,093
{\an1}Does this mean that I'm not able
to release the genjutsu or is
something else going on?!

00:11:56,686 --> 00:12:00,357
{\an1}No, of course it's not! 'Cause
this is a fake world created by
our enemy!

141
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:03,727
{\an1}I can't wast any time on fake
people like them!

142
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,731
{\an1}<i>(Neji) Oh, here she is!</i>

143
00:12:07,965 --> 00:12:09,900
{\an1}Good morning, Tenten.
How are you today?

144
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:15,040
{\an1}I gotta say, they did a good job
making you guys. Even up close,
you look real!

145
00:12:15,407 --> 00:12:17,409
{\an1}What does that mean? What are
you talking about?!

146
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:20,912
{\an1}Listen, I don't have any
intention of getting all
friendly with you.

147
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:26,319
{\an4}I'm not going to be training or
going on missions, so make sure
that you remember that, you got
it?

148
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:28,821
{\an1}(gasp) No training or going on
missions?!

149
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:33,059
{\an1}Uh...Hey, Lee...Do you think
Tenten's still half-asleep or
something?

150
00:12:33,393 --> 00:12:34,894
{\an1}I suppose it is possible.

151
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:41,201
{\an4}She left early yesterday when we
all ate...And it could very well
be that she caught a cold, too,
so she-

152
00:12:41,234 --> 00:12:45,572
{\an1}Look, I'm wide awake, and I
don't have a cold! Anyway,
please just leave me alone!

153
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,915
{\an1}Okay, no more distractions! I
gotta study everything I can get
my hands on!

154
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,756
{\an1}<i>(Rock Lee) What do you think is</i>
<i>going on with Tenten, anyway?</i>

155
00:13:02,557 --> 00:13:07,129
{\an4}Ditching her training and her
missions...That's completely
forbidden for a Hidden  Leaf
Shinobi!

156
00:13:07,595 --> 00:13:09,732
{\an1}Nyah, nyah! She must really hate
you!

157
00:13:10,366 --> 00:13:11,967
{\an1}I really don't think that's the
problem!

158
00:13:12,469 --> 00:13:14,870
{\an1}Then again, he could be right on
target about that.

159
00:13:15,238 --> 00:13:17,974
{\an1}I mean, face it: your team has
some serious issues.

160
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:23,113
{\an1}That is true. I know that I
wouldn't be able to handle all
of that vulgar talk...

161
00:13:23,747 --> 00:13:25,115
{\an1}You're saying I'm the problem?!

162
00:13:27,318 --> 00:13:31,055
{\an4}No, we aren't. As far as I've
been able to make out, her angry
feelings are directed at
something more than that.

163
00:13:31,989 --> 00:13:35,393
{\an1}Does that mean you are telling
us...that I am also to blame?

164
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:39,597
{\an1}LEAF VILLAGE LIBRARY

165
00:13:39,897 --> 00:13:42,401
{\an1}Guess I'll have to use the
library to research this.

166
00:13:42,968 --> 00:13:44,970
{\an1}I'm not used to visiting this
place, but...

167
00:13:46,238 --> 00:13:47,571
{\an1}<i>(Rock Lee) Uh, hey, Tenten!</i>

168
00:13:49,141 --> 00:13:52,210
{\an1}Why are you two here? I
mean,...didn't you hear what I
told you guys before?!

169
00:13:52,544 --> 00:13:56,049
{\an1}We did hear you! And that is
exactly why we are here!

170
00:13:56,782 --> 00:13:58,284
{\an1}Now, let us do this, Neji!

171
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,260
{\an1}<i>(Rock Lee and Neji) Please!</i>
<i>Forgive us!</i>

172
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,593
Huh?

173
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:10,730
{\an1}That was a really nice apology.

174
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:13,367
{\an1}Sincerity is reflected in your
attitude!

175
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:16,770
{\an1}<i>(Tenten) What's happening?! I</i>
<i>don't understand this at all!</i>

176
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:20,408
{\an1}<i>(Tenten) Wait,...could they be</i>
<i>Madara's henchmen?</i>

177
00:14:21,242 --> 00:14:25,914
{\an4}<i>(Tenten) Which must mean that</i>
<i>they intend to tempt me - or</i>
<i>drag me - into accepting this</i>
<i>world?!</i>

178
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:28,083
Huh?!

179
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:33,021
{\an4}Please give them a break and
forgive them, would you? They're
both really sorry for whatever
they did!

180
00:14:33,054 --> 00:14:34,990
{\an1}Yeah, I agree. Please forgive
them!

181
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:36,591
No-!

182
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:38,427
<i>Uh,...Tenten...?</i>

183
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:41,864
{\an1}You can all try to come after
me, but whatever you do, it
won't work!

184
00:14:42,264 --> 00:14:44,600
{\an1}<i>(Tenten) You, and you, and you!</i>

185
00:14:45,268 --> 00:14:47,437
{\an1}<i>Don't come near me till hell</i>
<i>freezes over! </i>

186
00:14:50,107 --> 00:14:51,108
{\an1}<i>(Choji) Oh,...wow!</i>

187
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:53,743
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) Ooooh! You're gonna</i>
<i>have to wait  a long time!</i>

188
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:04,222
{\an1}Seriously? I cannot believe she
said that.

189
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:07,559
{\an1}Now, now, Lee. Hang in there.
Don't get all depressed...

190
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:10,429
{\an1}But I do wonder what's making
her act this way...

191
00:15:11,196 --> 00:15:15,700
{\an1}Well, maybe she's not actually
mad, but she's just worried
about something instead?

192
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:17,302
Worried, huh?

193
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:23,309
{\an1}She has no appetite,...she
rejects her friends,...and she
wants to be left alone...

194
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:27,981
{\an1}It's completely clear to me!
There can be no mistake! She's
lovesick!

195
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:30,049
{\an1}Ha! That's all you ever think
about!

196
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,252
{\an1}<i>(Sakura) What do you think,</i>
<i>Menma?</i>

197
00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:36,689
{\an1}What I think is that we aren't
going to get anywhere just
talking amongst ourselves.

198
00:15:37,056 --> 00:15:38,057
{\an1}You're right about that.

199
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:42,196
{\an1}So instead, I say that all of us
should work together to do
something for Tenten!

200
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:43,130
{\an1}<i>(Neji) All right!</i>

201
00:15:43,164 --> 00:15:44,431
{\an1}<i>(Rock Lee) Let us do it!</i>

202
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:46,267
{\an1}<i>(Tenten) Nothing here...</i>

203
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:51,105
{\an1}<i>(Tenten) Or here. Or here,...or</i>
<i>here,...or here!</i>

204
00:15:52,073 --> 00:15:57,312
{\an4}I thought that I could find some
answers by coming here,...but
not one of these books is
helpful in the slightest!

205
00:15:58,813 --> 00:16:01,216
{\an1}It's not like I'm any good at
research to begin with...

206
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,188
{\an1}To be honest, I prefer to have
someone else do the thinking for
me...

207
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:12,762
{\an1}<i>(Tenten) I wonder what's</i>
<i>happening with everyone back in</i>
<i>the real world, right now...</i>

208
00:16:14,263 --> 00:16:16,433
{\an1}<i>(Tenten) I can't be wasting so</i>
<i>much time like this!</i>

209
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,650
A rose?

210
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,889
{\an1}That's a face longing for love
for sure, my kitt-

211
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,324
(Sasuke) [yelp]

212
00:16:40,492 --> 00:16:41,493
{\an1}Hey, just what do you think
you're trying to pull?!

213
00:16:42,994 --> 00:16:44,496
{\an1}I'm sorry about that, Tenten.

214
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:49,235
{\an1}I keep telling you to stay out
of my way! When are you guys
going to listen?!

215
00:16:51,003 --> 00:16:52,771
{\an1}Wait. You're leaving already?

216
00:16:53,506 --> 00:16:55,275
{\an1}Yeah, because you're bothering
me!

217
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,778
{\an4}You don't have to be so rude,
you know! All of us are just
really worried about you, that's
all!

218
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:03,651
{\an1}Enough! You can cut the act now,
you fakes!

219
00:17:04,451 --> 00:17:05,285
{\an1}<i>(Sakura) Ten...ten...?</i>

220
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,589
{\an1}You can try to get in my way,
but I'm not gonna quit!

221
00:17:09,123 --> 00:17:11,959
{\an1}I'm going to find a way to get
home to my own world!

222
00:17:13,427 --> 00:17:14,562
{\an1}She's got it bad.

223
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,198
{\an1}She's just upset thanks to your
stupid idea!

224
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:20,269
Oh boy...

225
00:17:23,938 --> 00:17:29,579
{\an4}I think she's beyond our help
now. She's in full battle mode
and just isn't listening to us
one bit!

226
00:17:30,078 --> 00:17:32,348
{\an1}So you didn't fare any better
than we dud, huh?

227
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:36,452
{\an1}If it is not Neji's dirty mind,
and is not that she is in
love,...

228
00:17:36,952 --> 00:17:38,588
{\an1}...then what can we possibly
do?!

229
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:40,623
{\an1}<i>(Shino) Leave her alone.</i>

230
00:17:41,457 --> 00:17:43,627
{\an1}<i>(Shino) And by that I mean don't</i>
<i>"bug" her...</i>

231
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,863
{\an1}He's right! Believe me, I'm sure
that's what Tenten wants!

232
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:50,701
{\an1}But is that not...too cold a way
to behave toward a friend?

233
00:17:51,335 --> 00:17:53,705
{\an1}Actually, I don't think that we
should leve her alone.

234
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:56,073
{\an1}Something has been bothering
me...

235
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,444
{\an1}Menma, you never cease to amaze
me!

236
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,714
{\an1}You're such a kind, good, and
thoughtful friend!

237
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:09,020
{\an4}You're the complete opposite of
that damn Tenten! You know what
I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go beat
some sense into that idiot!

238
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,657
{\an1}Oh...! Wait just a moment, Lady
Hinata!

239
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:13,526
She vanished!

240
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:17,897
{\an1}That was just a clone she left
behind. The real one is already
gone.

241
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,131
{\an1}Ugh, that Hinata!

242
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,300
{\an1}<i>(Rock Lee) I have a bad feeling</i>
<i>about this...</i>

243
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,505
{\an1}It's okay! I'll track her scent.
Everyone follow me!

244
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:37,618
{\an1}An entire day gone, and I still
haven't found any leads at all.

245
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,322
{\an1}Will I ever get back, or am I
stuck here for good?

246
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,827
{\an1}Is it even possible for me to
get back home?!

247
00:18:47,596 --> 00:18:48,096
Huh?!

248
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:52,133
{\an1}<i>(Hinata) The hell is this?</i>

249
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:55,838
{\an1}Wow, what an ugly weapon!

250
00:18:56,338 --> 00:18:58,974
{\an1}You can't just take that from
me! Now, give it back.

251
00:18:59,441 --> 00:19:04,246
{\an4}Yeah. No way. If you want it
back, you're gonna hafta
apologize for your behavior
today.

252
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:09,786
{\an1}<i>(Hinata) Everyone's all worried</i>
<i>about you, and all you do is</i>
<i>trash us and point fingers!</i>

253
00:19:10,754 --> 00:19:14,157
{\an1}No more games! Just spit it out,
Tenten, what is going on here?!

254
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:15,793
{\an1}<i>(Kiba) There she is!</i>

255
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,397
{\an1}Hinata! You're being too rough,
like always!

256
00:19:19,663 --> 00:19:22,767
{\an1}Just shut up! We won't get
anywhere otherwise!

257
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:25,536
{\an1}All right, then I'll just take
it back by force!

258
00:19:29,674 --> 00:19:30,040
[gasp]

259
00:19:30,675 --> 00:19:31,810
Hey, what-?!

260
00:19:32,244 --> 00:19:33,010
No! Hinata!

261
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:35,213
[gasp]

262
00:19:39,652 --> 00:19:40,620
[gasp]

263
00:19:41,253 --> 00:19:42,755
{\an1}Tenten, stand down.

264
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:48,761
Huh?

265
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:54,535
{\an1}What just happened?!

266
00:19:55,301 --> 00:19:56,135
{\an1}<i>(Shino) That was...</i>

267
00:19:59,273 --> 00:20:03,210
[chattering]

268
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,646
{\an1}<i>(Hinata) Hey, wait, damn it!</i>

269
00:20:06,313 --> 00:20:10,150
{\an1}You don't train something like
that on a friend. What is going
on with you, Tenten?

270
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:14,255
{\an1}You deserved it. Quit
pretending! You aren't my
friends!

271
00:20:14,622 --> 00:20:17,125
{\an1}<i>(Tenten) And I didn't ask you to</i>
<i>worry about me!</i>

{\an1}<i>(Tenten) I have goals of my own</i>
<i>to pursue. And I don't want any</i>
<i>of you to get in my way.</i>

273
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:29,371
{\an1}This isn't the place where I
belong. I don't care about this
village or any of you!

274
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:30,439
{\an1}<i>(Rock Lee) You are lying!</i>

275
00:20:30,473 --> 00:20:31,240
Huh?

276
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:32,776
{\an1}That cannot be true!

277
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,911
{\an1}<i>(Rock Lee) You are not really</i>
<i>like this!</i>

278
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,647
Hm.

279
00:20:55,533 --> 00:20:56,902
{\an1}Believe whatever you want to!

280
00:20:58,537 --> 00:21:00,539
{\an1}Man, what has gotten into her,
anyway?!

281
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,277
{\an1}This is more than just
weird...It's like she's a
totally different person, now!

282
00:21:05,911 --> 00:21:08,982
{\an1}[growl] She's really pissing me
off!

283
00:21:11,851 --> 00:21:13,853
{\an1}Those kids are fighting! Isn't
it terrible?!

284
00:21:14,253 --> 00:21:16,121
{\an1}Yeah, but, that's what kids are
like these days...

285
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:21,829
{\an1}Very interesting...

286
00:22:57,163 --> 00:22:59,834
{\an1}<i>(Tenten) All I want is to know</i>
<i>some methods to undo genjutsu!</i>

287
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:04,840
{\an4}<i>(Tenten) What do you do when the</i>
<i>usual release jutsu doesn't work</i>
<i>and you can't rely on help from</i>
<i>your friends?</i>

288
00:23:05,306 --> 00:23:07,475
{\an1}<i>(Kurenai) Wow, that's a very</i>
<i>difficult question...</i>

289
00:23:07,976 --> 00:23:11,813
{\an1}<i>(Kurenai) Maybe it's possible if</i>
<i>you're more powerful than the</i>
<i>jutsu user, but...</i>

290
00:23:12,146 --> 00:23:12,981
{\an1}<i>(Tenten) I thought so...</i>

291
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:17,486
{\an1}<i>(Naruto) Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Where Tenten</i>
<i>Belongs"</i>

292
00:23:18,487 --> 00:23:18,553
{\an1}<i>(Tenten) I have no idea what</i>
<i>else I can try!</i>
