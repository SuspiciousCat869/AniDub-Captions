00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,503
Huh? Sure haven't seen
him in a while, meow.

00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,404
Hmm?

{\an1}Granny Cat... Give me 400
ninja cat kunai knives

7
00:00:56,707 --> 00:01:04,588
{\an4}Well, well... Isn't this
quite the surprise! I'm
amazed you would actually
come here yourself...

8
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:08,997
{\an1}The Uchiha brat was
really very cute back
then, wasn't he?

9
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,281
{\an7}What?! Seriously? We're
going to catch another
cat?!

10
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:22,454
{\an1}Well... Not quite. You're
actually after Nekomata.

11
00:01:22,487 --> 00:01:26,162
{\an1}<i>And your mission is not</i>

12
00:01:31,272 --> 00:01:36,647

Nekomata, mountain lion,
cute little kitty cat,
whatever it is...

13
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,425
{\an4}This is just a D-rank
mission, so no thanks! -
- I say just let someone
else handle small-time

14
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:44,228
{\an1}stuff like this!

15
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:49,704
{\an4}Right, Sasuke? I mean,
aren't you tired of lame
missions like this one?
Go on! Tell him!

16
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:51,308
Uh, Sasuke...?

17
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:55,115
{\an1}You don't have to come
along if you don't want
to.

18
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:58,755
{\an1}This is an Uchiha- No,
wait... my mission.

19
00:01:58,788 --> 00:01:59,757
But why?!

{\an1}"Sasuke's Paw

21

I'm glad you've
come, Sasuke boy.

22
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:53,567
{\an1}It's been a long time,
Granny Cat.

23
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:55,637
{\an1}My, you're all

24
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,277
{\an7}You know her, Sasuke?
She's weird...

25
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,181
{\an7}What kinda place is this?

26
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:09,396
This shop is where the
Uchiha clan traditionally
buys all its weapons.

27
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:14,572
{\an4}<i>Granny Cat also provides</i>
<i>intel for the Uchiha, and</i>
<i>she's our client for this</i>
<i>mission. </i>

28
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:18,879
{\an1}Tamaki... Get the Paw
Encyclopedia and bring it
to me.

29
00:04:18,912 --> 00:04:21,585
{\an1}<i>Sure thing. Here you are,</i>
<i>Grandma. </i>

30
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:29,032
You bound all of
them into a book?

31
00:04:29,065 --> 00:04:34,141
{\an5}You know, Sasuke... You
sure do seem to know a
whole lot more about this
mission than we do.

32
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:37,147
I think you'd better
start doing some
explaining...

33
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,451
{\an1}[chuckling]

34
00:04:39,484 --> 00:04:42,991
{\an1}This book started as a
game between Sasuke and
his brother.

35
00:04:43,024 --> 00:04:43,592
Itachi-

36
00:04:43,626 --> 00:04:45,697
{\an1}Don't talk about Itachi!

37
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:48,401
Uh!

38
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,040
{\an1}I'm going to start
preparing for the
mission.

39
00:04:57,384 --> 00:04:59,823
So what was that all
about?!

40
00:04:59,855 --> 00:05:02,794
{\an1}<i>They used to be so close</i>
<i>back then... </i>

41
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:09,506
{\an4}I remember...
Itachi would often come
by on errands and bring
little Sasuke in tow...

42
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:14,014
{\an1}<i>Sasuke would get bored,</i>
<i>throw tantrums, and give</i>
<i>Itachi such a hard time. </i>

43
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:17,221
{\an1}<i>So Itachi came up with a</i>
<i>game for him to play... </i>

44
00:05:18,055 --> 00:05:24,166
{\an4}<i>He had Sasuke chase down all</i>
<i>the quick and nimble cats he</i>
<i>could catch, and then gather</i>
<i>paw prints from them.</i>

45
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,738
{\an1}It was a silly kid's
game!

46
00:05:26,772 --> 00:05:28,675
{\an1}Yes, I suppose...

47
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:34,152
{\an4}But remember... Sasuke
already had the skills of
a genin even before he
entered the Academy.

48
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:37,157
{\an1}From the start, he
was an Uchiha through and
through.

49
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,360
[grumbling]

50
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:43,436
{\an7}In any event..., it was
merely a cute game at
first.

51
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:47,577
{\an1}But things quickly began
to escalate.

52
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:53,954
{\an4}<i>Sasuke completed nearly</i>
<i>all the assignments</i>
<i>Itachi gave him, even the</i>
<i>ones given half in jest. </i>

53
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:59,298
{\an4}And then we collected
his stockpile of paw
prints and compiled them
all into this book.

54
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:03,973
{\an4}But even though Sasuke no
longer plays the game,
something about it
bothers me...

55
00:06:04,006 --> 00:06:07,948
{\an1}Sasuke never completed
two of the assignments
Itachi gave to him.

56
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:13,123
{\an4}<i>One was Ni'i of the</i>
<i>Hidden Cloud, but I asked</i>
<i>for her paw print, and</i>
<i>she kindly agreed. </i>

57
00:06:13,157 --> 00:06:16,463
{\an7}<i>Ni'i of the Hidden</i>
<i>Cloud? What's that?! </i>

58
00:06:16,497 --> 00:06:21,004
{\an4}Let me guess: you're
asking us to go and get
the final paw print, is
that it?

59
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:22,876
{\an1}Yes. However...

60
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:27,082
{\an1}The print you're after is
from Nekomata, a big
player in the ninja cat

61
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:29,888
{\an1}underworld; he never
shows his face in public.

62
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:35,063
{\an1}<i>His hideout is an</i>
<i>impregnable fortress. </i>

63
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:38,838
{\an1}<i>And he's guarded by a</i>
<i>seemingly endless amount</i>
<i>of ninja cats.</i>

64
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:42,277
{\an1}Can a three-man team of
genin handle something so
hard?

65
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:47,353
{\an4}Are you kidding me?!
We've handled way worse
than this! Just leave it
to us! Right, Sakura?!

66
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:53,531
{\an4}Keep in mind that Itachi
thought this assignment was
too dangerous for Sasuke
and wouldn't allow him to go.

67
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:56,202
{\an1}You'll have to be very
careful.

68
00:06:56,236 --> 00:07:00,444
{\an7}<i>So that's what was</i>
<i>bothering Sasuke.... this</i>
<i>whole thing with his</i>
<i>brother... </i>

69
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:08,893
{\an7}<i>Whatever limits he set</i>
<i>for me, I'll go far</i>
<i>beyond them.</i>

70
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:10,964
{\an1}<i>Hey! Sasuke! </i>

71
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:15,572
{\an1}Come on! Let's transform
into cats and sneak into
that guy's fortress!

72
00:07:15,606 --> 00:07:19,947
{\an7}<i>I guess the best way to</i>
<i>infiltrate a fortress of</i>
<i>cats is to become a</i>
<i>cat... </i>

73
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:22,852
{\an1}Transformation Jutsu!

74
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:29,430
{\an1}What kind of cat looks
like that?!

75
00:07:29,464 --> 00:07:33,038
{\an1}Aww, but I actually
thought it looked
pretty good.

76
00:07:33,071 --> 00:07:35,274
{\an1}But you don't need to
transform, meow!

77
00:07:35,308 --> 00:07:39,016
{\an1}And transforming won't
let you understand cat
speech, meow.

78
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:40,918
So here you go!

79
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:45,359
{\an4}If you put these on, the
cats will think you're
one of them, and you'll
understand them!

80
00:07:45,394 --> 00:07:49,701
{\an4}If it's that simple, then
why didn't you just give
us these from the very
start?!

81
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:55,679
{\an7}<i>I... actually have to</i>
<i>wear... this thing?! </i>

82
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:06,833
{\an4}<i>We're known in these</i>
<i>parts, so I'm afraid we</i>
<i>can't go any further,</i>
<i>meow. </i>

83
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:12,309
{\an4}<i>No ninja cat has ever</i>
<i>seen Nekomata's face. Do</i>
<i>you think you'll be able</i>
<i>to find him, meow? </i>

84
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:16,017
Thanks to these,
infiltrating his fortress
shouldn't be a problem.

85
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,855
{\an8}<i>You look so cute in</i>
<i>those, Sasuke! </i>

86
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:23,430
{\an1}If we can get inside his
stronghold, then the rest
will be no problem.

87
00:08:23,464 --> 00:08:24,933
Come on.
Let's go.

88
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:26,670
{\an1}Wait. Hold it.

89
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:31,277
{\an4}Sasuke... Look, we're
supposed to be able to
talk to ninja cats if we
wear these.

90
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,417
{\an1}And that means you won't
have to go start a fight
with the Nekomata guy.

91
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:38,892
{\an4}Let's just talk to him
about it; I bet that he'd
be willing to give you a
paw print or two!

92
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:39,861
Impossible.

93
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,764
{\an1}What?! But meow?!

94
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:46,907
{\an5}Having your paw print
taken is extremely
embarrassing for a cat,
meow. He'd never allow it!

95
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,046
{\an1}For a human, it's just
like someone stripping
off your clothes and

96
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,116
{\an1}taking a photograph of
you naked, meow.

97
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:58,427
{\an4}A naked photograph; is
that all? You just have
to sweet-talk someone into
doing something like that!

98
00:08:58,461 --> 00:09:02,068
{\an1}<i>I mean, I bet I could</i>
<i>even get Sakura to do it.</i>
<i>Meow, Sakura?</i>

99
00:09:02,102 --> 00:09:04,940
As if! You big pervert!

100
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:08,480
{\an1}I doubt talking will do
you any good, meow.

101
00:09:08,513 --> 00:09:11,820
{\an7}All right, well...
Thanks for showing us the
way, meow.

102
00:09:11,853 --> 00:09:13,255
{\an1}Get going, pervert meow.

103
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:21,838

<i>before meow. </i>

00:09:32,023 --> 00:09:33,626
Hmmm...

108
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:36,999
{\an5}For someone new, you're
quick to catch on to the
way things work here,

you your reward. This is

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,526
{\an5}What's with this
increased security? Does
anyone know what's going
on, meow?

136
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,265
I heard some humans
slipped in past the
guards, meow.

137
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:11,807
{\an5}If they come close, I'll
catch 'em and show 'em
a thing or two while I'm
at it! meow.

138
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,945
{\an7}Don't worry about Naruto.
I'm sure he's fine.

139
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:18,085
{\an7}Let's take advantage of
this commotion and search
for Nekomata.

140
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,593
{\an7}Sakura, you go look to
the East. I'll go west.

141
00:11:22,627 --> 00:11:25,966
{\an7}Huh? But we have to stick
together if this is going
to work!

142
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,208
{\an7}They already know that
we're inside the
fortress. Time's of the
essence.

143
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:32,979
{\an7}Right now, it's smarter
to split up to look.

144
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:35,417
{\an8}Oh, okay...
Let's do it!

145
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,395
{\an1}What's all the commotion
out there, meow?

146
00:11:41,428 --> 00:11:45,702
{\an4}Boss, a couple humans got
past the guards and
infiltrated the fortress,
meow!

147
00:11:45,735 --> 00:11:50,211
{\an1}What?! Human intruders?!
Find them and get rid of
them this instant, meow!

Yes, sir, meow!

seven years since the
last time...

{\an1}No, it couldn't be,
meow...

actually order anything
yet, meow.

157
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:12,061
{\an1}Compliments of that
customer.

158
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:18,039
Hello. May I come and
join you, meow...?

159
00:13:18,072 --> 00:13:19,108
Oh. Sure!

160

{\an1}Well, always nice to meet
someone new.

{\an1}How about a
little treat?

do you happen to know a
cat named Nekomata?

165
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:48,061
{\an7}Boss? Yeah! He always

These are supposed to be
used against cats, not by
them!

you yet...

Then why do it?!

256

{\an7}Because growth occurs
when one is pushed beyond
his limits.

{\an7}That knowledge is a vital
part of training.

when he faced me, Sasuke
passed Itachi's test
with flying colors.

{\an1}Indeed, I agree with you.
