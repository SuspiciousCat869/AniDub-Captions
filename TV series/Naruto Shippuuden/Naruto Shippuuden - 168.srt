1
00:00:10,837 --> 00:00:14,674
{\an1}-I worked it into the seal spell
that I'd appear on your psyche

2
00:00:14,707 --> 00:00:17,443
{\an1}if it ever happened that the
seal unraveled to the point

3
00:00:17,477 --> 00:00:20,245
{\an1}where you had sprouted
the eighth tail.

4
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,350
{\an1}Truth be told, I'd hoped that
it would never get this far,

5
00:00:25,384 --> 00:00:29,287
{\an1}since I didn't ever want to
see you again, Nine-Tails.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,722
[roaring]

7
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:34,625
-But then--

8
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,092
[gasp]

9
00:00:36,126 --> 00:00:38,762
{\an1}-I was looking forward
to seeing the young man

10
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:41,231
{\an1}that my son had now become.

11
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:43,165
{\an1}I guess it evens out.

12
00:00:43,198 --> 00:00:43,932
-Mmm.

13
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:47,403
{\an1}For the Hokage, come here.

14
00:00:47,436 --> 00:00:49,837
{\an1}I'll rip you to shreds!

15
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:51,507
-Well, if that's
the case, then I

16
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,042
{\an1}think that I'll just
remain over here.

17
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,344
{\an1}Wouldn't you agree, Naruto?

18
00:00:56,377 --> 00:00:57,044
-Wait.

19
00:00:57,077 --> 00:00:57,811
{\an1}You called me Naruto.

20
00:00:57,844 --> 00:00:59,346
{\an1}You know who I am?

21
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:03,684
But why?

22
00:01:03,717 --> 00:01:07,286
{\an1}Why in the world does the
fourth Hokage know my name?

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,521
-Simple.

24
00:01:08,554 --> 00:01:10,690
{\an1}I know because I named you.

25
00:01:10,723 --> 00:01:14,025
{\an1}Because the truth
is, you are my son.

26
00:01:14,059 --> 00:01:16,928
{\an1}-Did you say "son"?

27
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:18,730
Seriously?

28
00:01:18,763 --> 00:01:21,166
-That's right.

29
00:01:21,199 --> 00:01:23,768
{\an1}-Like I said before,
you are my son.

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,911
[laughter]

31
00:01:35,944 --> 00:01:37,846
[growl]

32
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:40,415
-Four Hokage!

33
00:01:40,449 --> 00:01:42,617
{\an1}-He's a loudmouth,
don't you think?

34
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:44,152
{\an1}So let's go somewhere
quieter, OK?

35
00:01:50,925 --> 00:01:53,728
[laughter]

36
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:57,063
{\an1}-Lord Third Hokage didn't tell
you much of anything, huh?

37
00:01:57,097 --> 00:01:59,165
{\an1}Guess he wanted to suppress
as much information

38
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:01,934
{\an1}about the Nine-Tails
as he could.

39
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:04,069
{\an1}If people had found
out you were my son,

40
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:06,773
{\an1}you would have been in danger.

41
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:07,740
-Dad.

42
00:02:07,773 --> 00:02:08,240
-Huh?

43
00:02:11,744 --> 00:02:12,977
-Augh!

44
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,946
{\an1}-Why would you ever want
to seal the Nine-Tails

45
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:16,714
{\an1}inside of your own son?

46
00:02:16,748 --> 00:02:20,217
{\an1}Do you have any idea what I went
through because you did that?

47
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,952
{\an1}All of the grown-ups
just looked at me

48
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:25,722
{\an1}with contempt, or with fear,
and I couldn't make any friends.

49
00:02:25,756 --> 00:02:28,958
{\an1}I just wanted people to accept
me, or at least not hate me,

50
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:31,828
{\an1}so I trained really hard to
become as strong as I could.

51
00:02:31,862 --> 00:02:35,264
{\an1}Then I met Iruka-sensei,
Kakashi-sensei, and Pervy Sage.

52
00:02:35,297 --> 00:02:38,133
{\an1}And I was happy, because
they helped make me stronger.

53
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,768
{\an1}But just when things
were looking up,

54
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:42,237
{\an1}a group called the
Akatsuki came after me.

55
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,972
{\an1}So then I had to train even
harder than I did before.

56
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:47,040
{\an1}I got stronger, but
couldn't stop the Akatsuki

57
00:02:47,074 --> 00:02:48,342
{\an1}from killing my friends.

58
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,644
{\an1}And I just-- I mean
I-- I-- I don't

59
00:02:50,677 --> 00:02:52,613
{\an1}know what I'm saying anymore!

60
00:02:52,646 --> 00:02:54,681
{\an1}Damn it, am I supposed
to be happy or mad?

61
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:56,282
{\an1}I don't even know.

62
00:02:56,315 --> 00:02:59,951
[sobbing]

63
00:02:59,985 --> 00:03:01,286
-Naruto.

64
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,190
{\an1}How old are you now?

65
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:07,159
-16.

66
00:03:07,192 --> 00:03:08,627
-I see.

67
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,561
16 already.

68
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:12,963
{\an1}It must have been
hard for you, Naruto.

69
00:03:12,997 --> 00:03:14,265
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:16,700
I really am.

71
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:18,368
{\an1}Though I suppose it's
little consolation

72
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:22,138
{\an1}if I apologize now,
after having put you

73
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:25,909
{\an1}through all of that difficulty.

74
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:27,209
-No.

75
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:28,977
It's fine.

76
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:32,314
{\an1}After all, I'm the son
of the Fourth Hokage.

77
00:03:32,347 --> 00:03:33,214
I'll deal.

78
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,221
{\an1}-Since you asked, I sealed half
of the Nine-Tails chakra inside

79
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:44,892
{\an1}of you because I believed that
you could master this power.

80
00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:46,893
{\an1}I did it because you're my son.

81
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:50,564
[gasp]

82
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,365
{\an1}-There is a reason I went
to the trouble to do this.

83
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,034
A big one.

84
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:59,003
{\an1}16 years before now,
when the Nine-Tails

85
00:03:59,037 --> 00:04:01,639
{\an1}attacked the village,
I learned something.

86
00:04:01,673 --> 00:04:03,041
-What?

87
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:05,543
-Back then, a
mastermind orchestrated

88
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:07,344
{\an1}the whole Nine-Tails attack.

89
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:08,579
-Mastermind?

90
00:04:08,612 --> 00:04:10,547
{\an1}-Quite a formidable Shinobi.

91
00:04:10,581 --> 00:04:12,349
{\an1}Someone you'd need
extraordinary strength

92
00:04:12,382 --> 00:04:15,886
to stand against
and hope to defeat.

93
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,620
{\an1}I believe he'll attack
our village again.

94
00:04:23,926 --> 00:04:28,430
{\an1}-But the entire Leaf Village
has already been destroyed.

95
00:04:28,463 --> 00:04:29,698
-Yeah.

96
00:04:29,731 --> 00:04:31,198
I saw.

97
00:04:31,232 --> 00:04:33,133
{\an1}From inside your mind.

98
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:34,068
-What?

99
00:04:34,101 --> 00:04:35,469
{\an1}You watched that?

100
00:04:35,503 --> 00:04:37,238
-I know about
Jiraiya-sensei, Too.

101
00:04:40,373 --> 00:04:43,877
{\an1}-So, was Pain the one who
attacked the village before,

102
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,245
{\an1}using the Nine-Tails?

103
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:46,011
-No.

104
00:04:46,044 --> 00:04:48,046
{\an1}It wasn't him that time.

105
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,349
{\an1}-Then who was it?

106
00:04:50,382 --> 00:04:51,884
{\an1}-He was an Akatsuki.

107
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,752
{\an1}The one who wears that mask.

108
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:58,489
[gasp]

109
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:01,325
{\an1}-When we fought, he saw right
through every single one

110
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:02,727
of my moves.

111
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,428
{\an1}He was extraordinary.

112
00:05:05,462 --> 00:05:09,332
{\an1}In fact, I think that
he's the one using Pain.

113
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:10,232
-No way.

114
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:11,233
You're wrong!

115
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:13,035
{\an1}Pain has a grudge against us.

116
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:15,504
{\an1}He said that the Hidden Leaf
ruined his village a long time

117
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:16,605
ago.

118
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,407
{\an1}-That's exactly right.

119
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,843
{\an1}And that hatred is being used.

120
00:05:20,876 --> 00:05:22,577
{\an1}-He's really being used?

121
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,512
{\an1}Someone as strong as he is?

122
00:05:24,546 --> 00:05:26,714
{\an1}And what about this
mastermind mass ninja?

123
00:05:26,748 --> 00:05:28,048
What's he up to?

124
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:31,852
{\an1}Why is the Hidden
Leaf always a target?

125
00:05:31,885 --> 00:05:34,955
-As long as the
Shinobi culture exists,

126
00:05:34,988 --> 00:05:38,691
{\an1}there may never be
true peace and order.

127
00:05:38,724 --> 00:05:40,960
{\an1}Pain queried you about peace.

128
00:05:40,993 --> 00:05:42,528
But finding the
solution is difficult.

129
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,466
{\an1}-So, Naruto, how would you
confront this hatred in order

130
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,534
to create peace?

131
00:05:55,406 --> 00:05:58,409
{\an1}-In order to try to protect
something that's precious,

132
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,410
wars are waged.

133
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:08,283
{\an1}As long as there is love in this
world, there will also be hate.

134
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:11,119
{\an1}And some will take
advantage of that hatred.

135
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:13,221
{\an1}As long as we have
this ninja system,

136
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:15,591
{\an1}this monster known
as hate will live.

137
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:19,226
{\an1}It will give birth
to more Pains.

138
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,830
{\an1}Pain may have actually
killed Jiraiya-sensei,

139
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:25,365
{\an1}but if you look deeper,
then one could even

140
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:29,836
{\an1}say that this disordered Shinobi
world created Pain and killed

141
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:31,338
Jiraiya.

142
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:35,909
{\an1}To be a ninja means that
you must confront hatred.

143
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:40,412
{\an1}And every one of us must
battle against that hatred.

144
00:06:40,446 --> 00:06:43,448
{\an1}Jiraiya-sensei bequeathed
to you the quest

145
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:46,451
{\an1}for the solution that
would end this hatred.

146
00:06:46,484 --> 00:06:51,355
{\an1}-But how can I when I can't
find a way to forgive Pain?

147
00:06:51,388 --> 00:06:52,723
{\an1}There's just no way.

148
00:06:52,756 --> 00:06:53,924
I can't.

149
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:55,459
-I know.

150
00:06:55,492 --> 00:06:56,827
-Fourth Hokage.

151
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,096
Please tell me!

152
00:06:59,161 --> 00:07:00,563
{\an1}What should I do?

153
00:07:05,835 --> 00:07:08,938
{\an1}-You must find that
answer for yourself,

154
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:11,806
{\an1}because even I don't know it.

155
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,408
{\an1}-But if you and Pervy Sage don't
have a clue about the answer,

156
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:17,112
{\an1}how am I ever supposed
to figure it out?

157
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:19,313
{\an1}Everyone expects too much of me.

158
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:20,681
{\an1}I mean, look at me!

159
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:21,682
I'm not smart.

160
00:07:21,715 --> 00:07:22,716
{\an1}I'm not a great ninja.

161
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,651
{\an1}I'm-- I'm just me.

162
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:27,487
And how's a guy
like me supposed--

163
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,155
{\an1}-I'm certain that you'll be
able to find the answer, Naruto.

164
00:07:33,993 --> 00:07:35,594
{\an1}Because I believe
in you completely.

165
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,838
-You do?

166
00:07:47,872 --> 00:07:49,372
{\an1}Do you really think I can?

167
00:07:49,406 --> 00:07:52,575
{\an1}-Well, a parent's duty is
to unconditionally believe

168
00:07:52,609 --> 00:07:53,376
{\an1}in their children.

169

Now, then.

170
00:07:58,148 --> 00:08:00,949
{\an1}I'm afraid that it's
time for me to go.

171
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:03,085
{\an1}My chakra is starting to fade.

No.

Don't go.

175
00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:12,060
{\an1}-I'll rebuild the seal now.

{\an1}Naruto, you can do it.

Shadow Clone at Mount Myoboku.

{\an1}Do you finally comprehend pain?

00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:33,428
{\an1}Unless you come to
know the same pain,

236
00:14:33,461 --> 00:14:36,463
you cannot truly
comprehend someone else.

237
00:14:36,497 --> 00:14:38,598
And even if you
comprehend them, you still

238
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:42,535
{\an1}may not ever agree with them.

for you to chase after Sasuke.

-Enough of this.

242
00:14:55,846 --> 00:14:58,282
{\an1}Just take me to where
the real Pain is.

him face-to-face now.

{\an1}I want to talk to
him face-to-face now.

247
00:15:17,832 --> 00:15:22,136
{\an1}-So, you figured that
part out, did you?

248
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,972
{\an1}First Jiraiya-sensei
and now you as well.

249
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:27,974
{\an1}You Leaf Ninja are
really quite impressive.

250
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:30,811
{\an1}But our discussion's over.

251
00:15:30,844 --> 00:15:34,747
{\an1}Further conversation will
change absolutely nothing.

252
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,183
{\an1}-I just want to discuss
something with him.

253
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:39,919
{\an1}-You're in Sage Mode now.

254
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:42,555
{\an1}I believe that you are
limited to generating only two

255
00:15:42,587 --> 00:15:46,057
{\an1}of those bothersome
chakra shuriken at a time.

256
00:15:46,091 --> 00:15:47,859
Isn't that so?

257
00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:50,861
{\an1}And that causes your
Sage Mode to run out.

258
00:15:50,894 --> 00:15:53,964
{\an1}-I guess I have no choice
but to fight you, huh?

00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:55,999
-If both of your
shuriken should miss,

260
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:59,203
{\an1}the only possible outcome
is that you shall lose.

261
00:15:59,236 --> 00:16:01,671
{\an1}You'll have no more chances.

262
00:16:01,704 --> 00:16:03,806
{\an1}I will take you almost
to the point of death

263
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,209
{\an1}and haul you off.

264
00:16:06,242 --> 00:16:08,277
{\an1}-Well, that's too bad.

265
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:11,346
{\an1}I'll find the real
Pain myself, then.

266
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:12,914

going to do that?

hidden those Shadow Clones.

I can launch my next jutsu.

throw that jutsu.

314
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:02,815
{\an1}I've got five seconds.

315
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:04,950
{\an1}This distance will keep me safe.

316
00:20:04,984 --> 00:20:13,825
{\an1}-Look, Pain, just give up on
trying to make me give up.

-The fact that
you're here-- does

320
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,887
{\an1}that mean that you won out
against the Sixth Pain?

321
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:04,055
{\an1}-It doesn't really matter
who won or who lost.

322
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,091
{\an1}-Tell us what happened.

323
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:07,893
{\an1}-It's not really important.

324
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:10,595
{\an1}I'm on my way to see
the real Pain right now.

325
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,129
And please don't
try to follow me.

326
00:22:12,163 --> 00:22:13,297
{\an1}I want to go alone.

327
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,399
-Alone?

328
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:17,668
{\an1}-Next time, on Naruto Shippuden.

to confirm with him.

{\an1}-Yamato's Room has been
renamed Guy's Room.

332
00:22:29,978 --> 00:22:30,945
Hello, everyone.

333
00:22:30,978 --> 00:22:32,146
{\an1}This is your idol.

334
00:22:32,181 --> 00:22:32,748
Me.

335
00:22:32,781 --> 00:22:34,148
Might Guy.

336
00:22:34,182 --> 00:22:38,920
{\an1}Our guest today is the pride of
the Leaf Village. [inaudible].

-Hello, sir--

338
00:22:40,388 --> 00:22:41,254
-Oh, come on.

339
00:22:41,288 --> 00:22:42,422
{\an1}Don't be so bashful.

340
00:22:42,457 --> 00:22:43,858
Not on my show.

341
00:22:43,891 --> 00:22:44,826
-Oh, uh--

342
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:46,726
-She's extremely
introverted and shy.

343
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,562
{\an1}Her hobby is pressed
flower art and she

344
00:22:48,595 --> 00:22:51,263
{\an1}loves cinnamon rolls
and sweet bean jam.

345
00:22:51,297 --> 00:22:52,965
{\an1}Ah, forget the script.

346
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:55,234
{\an1}I'll just ask you
whatever comes to mind.

347
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:57,803
{\an1}That's what a hip, lively
interview is all about.

348
00:22:57,837 --> 00:22:59,003
-Huh?

349
00:22:59,037 --> 00:23:01,639
{\an1}-Oh, by the way, you've
really matured lately.

350
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:03,074
Are you in love?

351
00:23:03,107 --> 00:23:04,175
Is that it?

[mumbling]

353
00:23:05,108 --> 00:23:06,611
{\an1}-All right, then.

354
00:23:06,644 --> 00:23:08,378
{\an1}Just look into the
camera and tell us

355
00:23:08,412 --> 00:23:09,413
{\an1}all that's in your heart!

356
00:23:09,446 --> 00:23:10,781
{\an1}-Oh, but I couldn't--

357
00:23:10,814 --> 00:23:12,416
{\an1}-If you're too shy,
then I'll help you.

358
00:23:12,449 --> 00:23:13,817
{\an1}-But I just don't think--

359
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,451
{\an1}-OK, love confession time.

360
00:23:15,485 --> 00:23:16,720
Let's do this.

361
00:23:16,753 --> 00:23:18,922
{\an1}In three, two, one, go!

362
00:23:18,956 --> 00:23:20,156
-Ahhhh!

363
00:23:20,189 --> 00:23:21,591
No, I can't!

364
00:23:21,624 --> 00:23:22,525
-Ahh!

365
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:23,893
I'm OK.
