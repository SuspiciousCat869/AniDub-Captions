{\an1}Are you doing all right,

4
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:45,210
{\an1}I thought that I might've heard
you groaning in your sleep.

5
00:02:45,244 --> 00:02:48,548
I've just been having
these really bizarre
dreams lately.

6
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:52,087
{\an1}Don't tell me, are they
about bitter memories from
your past?

7
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:54,357
{\an1}So, you too, huh?

8
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:59,365
{\an1}The memories one wishes to
forget most, tend to stick
like glue.

9
00:02:59,398 --> 00:03:03,272
{\an1}Perchance it's due to old
age. [chuckles]

10
00:03:03,304 --> 00:03:05,307
{\an1}Hey I'm only nineteen, you know!

11
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:07,845
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) By the way, have you</i>

12
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:11,784
Ever since we came here,
there hasn't been any wind.

{\an1}<i>(Ro) You're right. It's</i>

15
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:26,774
{\an1}Hopefully the plan to fake her
death is going smoothly, though.

16
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:31,982
{\an1}<i>(Med Ninja) Getting killed by</i>

18

21
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:51,646
{\an1}What is that?

22
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:54,918
{\an1}Intel on Gengo, the guy that
controls this village.

23
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:58,590
{\an1}It looks like it was collected
by the ANBU. You want to read
it?

24
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:03,365
{\an1}Well, it's always a good idea
to know all one can about
one's target.

25
00:04:03,397 --> 00:04:05,500
{\an1}Let's see here...

26
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:08,973
{\an1}[gasps] But, this is...

27
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:11,010
{\an1}It's completely blank!

28
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,145
Which means...

29
00:04:12,178 --> 00:04:14,949
{\an1}they couldn't even learn a
single thing about him.

30
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:18,922
{\an1}<i>(Ro) There's just this one page?</i>

31
00:04:19,455 --> 00:04:23,029
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) Yeah, and ten</i>

32

39

40
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:54,410
{\an1}Well, it looks like you
managed to pull it off.

41
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:57,047
Ugh, pretending to be
dead is, like, so creepy.

42
00:04:57,082 --> 00:05:01,188
{\an1}<i>(Ro) The alternative would've</i>

43

44
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:08,332
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) So? Did you learn</i>
<i>anything?</i>

45
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:11,404
{\an1}About Gengo, we have like
nothing on him.

46
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:14,041
{\an1}And no one knows anything about
the inside of the castle.

47
00:05:14,074 --> 00:05:18,948
{\an1}<i>(Ro) It seems the man known as</i>
<i>Gengo rarely appears in front</i>
<i>of others.</i>

48
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:23,490
{\an1}I learned one thing, though.
The name of that place. It's
called Fushu Castle.

49
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:24,791
Fushu?

50
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:30,600
It's actually an epithet
for prisoners of war or a savage
group living in a central area.

51
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:34,072
{\an1}Why give a name like that to
your land's main castle?

52
00:05:34,105 --> 00:05:37,010
{\an1}Like, I can't believe that
anyone would actually do that.

53
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:39,013
{\an1}Did you hear anything about
Sai?

54
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,681
{\an1}<i>(Soku) No, nothing at all.</i>

55
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,255
{\an1}Hmm. Well, it seems
this Gengo is a very cautious
man.

56
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:47,759
{\an1}He's definitely worth looking
into.

57
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:51,833
{\an1}All right then, what do you
say we go get some
barbecue?

58
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:56,039
[street chatter]

59
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:01,515
{\an1}Can you honestly tell me
that this is barbecue, Pops?

60
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:03,684
If you're just gonna
complain, leave!

61
00:06:03,717 --> 00:06:05,887
{\an1}Hey, I didn't say I wasn't
gonna eat it!

62
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:09,294
{\an1}Look everyone's short of
supplies lately, but it's better
than nothing!

63
00:06:10,061 --> 00:06:13,467
{\an1}Like, there are guys here from
all over the place.

64
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,272
{\an1}They probably came here to
make money by taking on
shinobi work.

65
00:06:18,374 --> 00:06:21,378
{\an1}How long has it been since you
opened up your shop here?

66
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:25,319
{\an1}About ten years, I guess? It
was around the same time that
Gengo showed up.

67
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:29,225
{\an1}<i>(proprietor) You think it's bad</i>
<i>here now. It was way worse then.</i>

68
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:31,394
{\an1}So this Gengo's an outsider
too?

69
00:06:31,428 --> 00:06:36,802
{\an1}He and his gang showed up out
of the blue and kicked out the
Feudal Lord, who was a tyrant.

70
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:39,740
{\an1}Feudal Lords are always like
that, no matter where you go.

71
00:06:39,974 --> 00:06:41,843
{\an1}And did living conditions
improve?

72
00:06:42,345 --> 00:06:45,483
{\an1}Well, tell me what you think!
Just look at this place!

73
00:06:45,517 --> 00:06:49,956
{\an1}<i>(Proprietor) They're all Gengo's</i>

<i>everyone around.</i>

74
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,727
{\an1}<i>It was great that he kicked out</i>

75
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,365
{\an1}<i>but after he took over, it was</i>

76
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,171
{\an1}I've seen that face
somewhere before.

77
00:06:59,204 --> 00:07:02,409
{\an1}Yes, as have I. I was just
thinking the same thing.

78
00:07:18,534 --> 00:07:22,540
{\an1}There's no mistake.
That's Minoichi, a former ANBU
member.

79
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:25,212
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) I thought I'd heard</i>

80
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,417
{\an1}<i>(Soku) I don't remember anyone</i>
<i>like that.</i>

81
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,852
{\an1}Well, it's no wonder that you
wouldn't.

82
00:07:30,886 --> 00:07:33,658
{\an1}It was before your time, in the
Fourth Great Ninja War.

83
00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:36,862
{\an1}So you probably don't know
that he killed everyone in his
unit.

84
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:39,199
{\an1}And after doing that, he went
into hiding.

{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) [groans] I can't</i>

this village, acting all high
and mighty?

Good. You're awake.

00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,920
{\an1}You had me like, worried.

144
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:30,926
I was simply caught
in a dream.

145
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:35,067
{\an1}If you don't wanna talk about
it, then I understand.

146
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:39,673
{\an1}It's funny how the things you
most wish to forget...

147
00:11:39,707 --> 00:11:42,510
{\an1}always seem to stick in your

149
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:53,595
{\an1}The unit I was assigned
to was ambushed by the enemy. My
comrades were annihilated.

150
00:11:56,432 --> 00:12:02,109
{\an1}<i>(Ro) I was the lone survivor, so</i>
<i>I buried myself under their</i>

153
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:16,363
{\an1}<i>But this jutsu is a cursed</i>

154
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:19,468
{\an1}Gained from my

155
00:12:19,502 --> 00:12:22,573
{\an1}Something similar happened to
me, as well.

156
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:26,446
{\an1}The revolutionaries are, like,
gathering in the square
outside.

157
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:31,621
{\an1}I'm guessing that they're
planning something.

158
00:12:31,654 --> 00:12:33,590
{\an1}Then let's go and find out.

159
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:37,930
{\an1}Yeah, except we can't. Not
dressed the way we are.

160
00:12:40,768 --> 00:12:43,338
{\an1}What we need is, like, two
more uniforms.

161
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,791
{\an1}All right, Ro, is the chakra
disguise ready to go?

162
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:59,630
{\an1}I've already replicated the
chakra of the owners of these
clothes.

163
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:02,234
{\an1}Soku, we're counting on you if
this goes south.

164
00:13:03,436 --> 00:13:05,573
{\an1}Soku, are you listening?

165
00:13:05,606 --> 00:13:06,742
{\an1}<i>(Silence Captain) Hey, you!</i>

166
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:07,542
Hmm?

167
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,897
{\an1}Fix that collar of yours! Lord
Gengo himself is going to
address us!

168
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,633
{\an1}So you had better shape up!

169
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,336
{\an1}Yes, of course. I'm sorry, Sir.

170
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:28,308
{\an1}If you're not doing anything,
then help with the
preparations! Got it?

171
00:13:29,244 --> 00:13:31,981
{\an1}Seems like that was perfect
timing, wasn't it?

172
00:13:32,015 --> 00:13:35,119
{\an1}To be honest, it almost seems
a little too perfect.

173
00:13:35,386 --> 00:13:40,528
{\an1}But still, we can't pass up
this opportunity, not if
Gengo's gonna be right here.

174
00:13:45,468 --> 00:13:48,941
{\an1}From up here, we can get Gengo
no matter where he tries to
hide.

175
00:13:49,307 --> 00:13:53,614
{\an1}Hmm? Hey, Soku, stay alert.
Looks like you're spacing out.

176
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:55,450
{\an1}What Minoichi was saying.

177
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:56,351
What was that?

178
00:13:57,855 --> 00:14:00,792
{\an1}Kicking out the Feudal Lords
and creating the ideal world
for shinobi.

179
00:14:00,826 --> 00:14:04,131
{\an1}I don't know, that doesn't
really sound like such a bad
idea to me.

180
00:14:04,598 --> 00:14:06,836
{\an1}What exactly are you saying,
Soku?

181
00:14:06,869 --> 00:14:08,738
{\an1}Like, it's just that...

182
00:14:08,772 --> 00:14:13,545
{\an1}it's hard to accept this system
with useless Feudal Lords
sitting at the top.

183
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:17,085
{\an1}C'mon, Ro! You can't say
you've never thought
about it!

184
00:14:17,118 --> 00:14:19,055
Uh! Hmm.

185
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:21,692
{\an1}I really do understand where
you're coming from.

186
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:24,128
{\an1}But right now, I need you to
focus on the mission.

187
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,400
{\an1}Distraction can lead you to
make serious mistakes.

188
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,606
{\an1}Like, I know. No need to
tell me.

190
00:14:45,996 --> 00:14:51,638

really confident. Well, either
that, or he's really stupid.

arrive.

193
00:14:57,748 --> 00:15:00,151
{\an1}Let's expose this guy for what
he really is!

194
00:15:07,896 --> 00:15:13,571
{\an1}First of all, I want to
extend my thanks to everyone
who's come together here.

00:15:17,378 --> 00:15:18,380
Everyone.

{\an1}If we move up a little closer
to Gengo, I can get him with
Shadow Stitching easier.

199
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:31,499
Follow me.

quite special planned.
