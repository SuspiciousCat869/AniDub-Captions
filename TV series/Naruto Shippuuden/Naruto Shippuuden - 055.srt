00:00:16,023 --> 00:00:17,291
You seem fine.

00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:18,393
Good.

5
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,263
You're cleared to leave
the hospital today.

6
00:00:20,296 --> 00:00:22,366
-By any chance, this
isn't because you

7
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,271
want me to hurry up and get
my baggage out of here, is it?

There's that too.

-That fool Naruto
has been camped out

12
00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:38,555
in this hospital
for days, just so he

13
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:41,459
can resume training
the minute you recover.

14
00:00:41,493 --> 00:00:44,130
-Actually, I was kind of
hoping I could take it easy

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,166
and recuperate at
home for a few days

16
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:49,103
before getting back into
it, but since I've run out

17
00:00:49,137 --> 00:00:51,740
of reading material
anyway, I suppose

18
00:00:51,774 --> 00:00:54,077
I might as well start
his training again.

19
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,279
-Hm.

owe me Ramen for life.

-Oh nothing.

34
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:18,416
It's just been so
long since I've

35
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,653
trained with you,
Kakashi Sensei.

36
00:03:20,686 --> 00:03:22,321
I don't know
exactly why, but I'm

37
00:03:22,355 --> 00:03:24,091
feeling really good about it.

43
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:37,343
-Time will not
stand still for us.

44
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:40,114
As I told you at the hospital,
the goal of this training

45
00:03:40,114 --> 00:03:42,651
is to create an ultimate
ninjutsu for you,

46
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:45,555
one that is uniquely
your own, a jutsu that

47
00:03:45,588 --> 00:03:49,294
goes beyond the Rasengan.

48
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:52,364
In order to do that, you'll
need to master two techniques,

49
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,367
how to change your
chakra's nature

50
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,104
and how to change its form.

51
00:03:57,138 --> 00:04:00,643
-How to change my chakra's
nature and change its form.

52
00:04:00,677 --> 00:04:01,845
-Huh.

53
00:04:02,078 --> 00:04:03,247
OK.

54
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,648
I thought maybe you could
handle two things at once,

55
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:06,117
but I guess I was wrong.

56
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:08,521
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:08,521 --> 00:04:10,257
One thing at a time.

58
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,460
We'll start with changing
the chakra's form.

59
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:12,943
-Right.

60
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:14,210
Got it.

61
00:04:14,244 --> 00:04:15,479
KAKASHI: Do your
Rasengan for me.

62
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:18,517
-Sure.

63
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,622
No problem.

64
00:04:21,622 --> 00:04:22,823
Are you ready?

65
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:23,825
Let's do it.

66
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:35,307
Rasengan!

67
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:35,791
-OK.

68
00:04:35,824 --> 00:04:36,391
OK.

69
00:04:36,425 --> 00:04:37,025
Stop.

70
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:37,692
-Huh?

71
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:41,799
-There you see.

72
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:44,569
You've already mastered
the change in chakra form.

73
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:45,638
-Huh?

74
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:47,641
-Your Rasengan has seen to that.

75
00:04:47,674 --> 00:04:50,044
-My-- it has?

76
00:04:50,278 --> 00:04:51,946
-Compressing your
chakra into a sphere

77
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,452
and then making it spin like
crazy at blinding speed, that's

78
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:57,621
a change in form if
ever there was one.

79
00:04:57,655 --> 00:05:01,293
In fact, your Rasengan carries
the technique to an extreme.

80
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:04,298
-So then, I've already
passed the first part.

81
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:04,965
-Mhm.

82
00:05:04,965 --> 00:05:08,671
That's about the size of it.

83
00:05:08,704 --> 00:05:09,271
-Woohoo!

84
00:05:12,642 --> 00:05:17,784
-Now then, the next step is
the change in chakra nature.

85
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,751
OK.

86
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:22,724
Let's take the
Chidori for example.

87
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:24,794
This is a jutsu that
requires accomplishing

88
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:27,998
both a change in the chakra's
form and a change in its nature

89
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:29,701
simultaneously.

90
00:05:29,734 --> 00:05:30,869
Watch carefully.

91
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:33,539
First, I concentrate the
chakra in my right hand.

92
00:05:37,645 --> 00:05:39,448
Then I change the
nature of it, so it's

93
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:42,352
like an electrical current.

94
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:45,723
-So that's the change in nature?

95
00:05:45,723 --> 00:05:47,292
-Exactly.

96
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:49,061
And now, I change
its form so that it

97
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:54,302
will discharge at whatever
range and level I determine.

98
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:55,671
-Whoa.

99
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:56,906
-That's the secret.

100
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,909
In order to move
beyond the Rasengan

101
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,078
to an even more
powerful jutsu, you'll

102
00:06:01,312 --> 00:06:04,082
have to learn how to execute
a change in chakra form

103
00:06:04,316 --> 00:06:08,889
and a change in chakra
nature like with the Chidori.

104
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:09,858
-Piece of cake.

105
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:11,593
I'm already halfway there.

106
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:13,729
All I got to do is add this
change of nature thingy

107
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:15,766
to my Rasengan, and
bingo, ultimate ninjutsu!

108
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:20,472
-Listen, Naruto.

109
00:06:20,472 --> 00:06:22,742
I'm afraid it's not
quite that easy.

110
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:24,745
It's not something
you just add on.

111
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:27,816
And anyway, you don't
know how to do it yet.

112
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:30,888
I bet you don't even know
the nature of your own chakra

113
00:06:30,888 --> 00:06:32,423
as it is right now.

114
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:33,558
-Huh?

115
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:35,060
It's got a nature.

116
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:39,533
--[sigh] Well, I kind of figured
it might be difficult making

117
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,769
you understand all this.

118
00:06:41,803 --> 00:06:42,504
OK.

119
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:44,473
Listen very closely.

120
00:06:44,506 --> 00:06:46,776
There are five basic
types or natures

121
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:51,618
of chakra-- fire, wind,
water, lightning, and earth.

122
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:53,886
The five great nations
took their names

123
00:06:53,886 --> 00:06:56,324
from these five chakra natures.

124
00:06:56,358 --> 00:06:59,362
They are the foundation of all
ninjutsu and the foundation

125
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:01,765
for everything we
learn as shinobi.

126
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:02,499
-Whoa!

127
00:07:02,532 --> 00:07:04,902
I had no idea.

128
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:07,039
-Most everyone's
chakra falls under one

129
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:09,643
of these five natures.

130
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:12,346
For example, members
of the Uchiha clan

131
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:17,755
have fiery natures, which is why
they excel at Fire Style Jutsu.

132
00:07:17,788 --> 00:07:21,026
Wind nature leads to Wind
Style Jutsu, and lightning

133
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:23,629
to Lighting Style,
like the Chidori, which

134
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:26,366
is, of course, a
Lightning Style Jutsu.

135
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:27,368
-Wait.

136
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:28,636
So that means that
someone like Sasuke

137
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,775
has two natures going for
him, both fire and lightning.

138
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:33,343
-That's right.

139
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:36,548
Whereas right now,
you don't have any.

140
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:41,055
We don't even know which nature
you're predisposed to yet.

141
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,523
-What?

142
00:07:42,523 --> 00:07:45,594
So we're going to find out,
using these slips of paper.

143
00:07:45,628 --> 00:07:47,029
-How are we going to do that?

144
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,642
-If you have a lightning
nature like me,

145
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,545
the paper will wrinkle.

146
00:07:57,578 --> 00:08:00,916
If you have wind
nature, it tears.

147
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,453
A fire nature will make it burn.

148
00:08:03,486 --> 00:08:07,025
A water nature, the
paper becomes wet.

149
00:08:07,058 --> 00:08:09,362
An earth nature, and
it crumbles away.

150
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:15,636
These are litmus papers
that react to chakra.

151
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,639
They come from a
special kind of tree

152
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:20,110
that grows by absorbing chakra.

153
00:08:20,143 --> 00:08:22,646
Just let your chakra
flow into this paper,

154
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,418
and we'll find out what
nature you possess, Naruto.

155
00:08:30,091 --> 00:08:31,526
-OK.

156
00:08:31,526 --> 00:08:32,528
[deep breath]

157
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:51,655
[ripping]

158
00:08:56,595 --> 00:08:57,863
-Well, now you know.

159
00:08:57,897 --> 00:09:00,868
Your chakra nature is wind.

160
00:09:00,902 --> 00:09:02,370
-Wind, huh.

161
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:04,773
-It's a chakra nature
that's perfect for battle.

162
00:09:04,807 --> 00:09:07,645
It can rip and sever almost
anything in its path.

163
00:09:07,678 --> 00:09:09,079
-Oh yeah.

164
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:09,981
I knew it.

165
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:11,516
I'm unstoppable.

166
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,518
-Hold your horses.

167
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,922
We've only just
figured out what it is.

168
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,790
Now comes the hard
part, learning

169
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:19,027
how to properly use and
control your nature.

170
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,863
-Let's do it.

171
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:23,667
-The problem is normally it
would take an incredible amount

172
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,472
of time to really master
this technique, time

173
00:09:26,505 --> 00:09:27,873
that we don't have.

174
00:09:27,906 --> 00:09:30,477
But the good news is I
think I've hit upon a way

175
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,080
to shorten our training
time considerably.

176
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:34,583
-Awesome.

177
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,686
-The one way to do that is to--

178
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:38,889
-Huh?

179
00:09:38,922 --> 00:09:39,857
NARUTO: Captain Yamato.

180
00:09:42,694 --> 00:09:44,396
What are you doing here?

181
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,602
-Kakashi thought my special
expertise might be of use.

182
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:49,905
He asked me to help
you with your training.

183
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:51,006
Sorry.

184
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,876
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything, Kakashi.

185
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:53,710
-No.

186
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,578
Not at all.

187
00:09:54,612 --> 00:09:55,746
I was just about to--

188
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:58,116
-Hey, Captain Yamato, which
one of the five natures

189
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:01,788
does your Wood Style
Jutsu fall under, huh?

190
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:04,158
-Huh.

191
00:10:04,392 --> 00:10:06,428
Well, you see--

192
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:09,900
-He may be a little unfocused,
but at least he's enthusiastic.

193
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:10,634
Go on.

194
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:12,169
Go ahead tell him.

195
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,072
-Right.

196
00:10:14,106 --> 00:10:16,643
Well, Earth Style.

197
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:18,012
Rampart of Flowing Soil.

198
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:25,088
-What the--

199
00:10:25,122 --> 00:10:25,856
-Water Style.

200
00:10:25,856 --> 00:10:27,057
Waterfall Basin Jutsu.

201
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,100
-Waterfall.

202
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,005
Cool.

203
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:41,745
-You see, Naruto, I possess both
earth and water chakra natures.

204
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:42,713
-Huh.

205
00:10:42,713 --> 00:10:45,584
You've got more
than one of them?

206
00:10:45,584 --> 00:10:48,422
-Eventually, when you get
to be a jonin-class ninja,

207
00:10:48,455 --> 00:10:50,657
you generally have two or more.

208
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,827
There are other natures I
can use besides lightning,

209
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,463
you know.

210
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:56,466
-So that means
Captain Yamato really

211
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:58,669
has three of them,
including his Wood Style?

212
00:10:58,703 --> 00:10:59,637
-No.

213
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,873
No, that's not
quite how it works.

214
00:11:01,873 --> 00:11:03,142
-It isn't?

215
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:06,714
-Earth and water natures are
the only ones that I can use.

216
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:08,583
You see, technically,
Naruto, there

217
00:11:08,617 --> 00:11:10,987
is no such thing
as a wood nature.

218
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:12,589
-Then how did you do that?

219
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,993
-By combining the other two.

220
00:11:15,026 --> 00:11:18,898
By activating the earth and
water natures simultaneous,

221
00:11:18,932 --> 00:11:22,169
he's able to create
something new, a wood nature.

222
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:25,741
-Earth with my right
hand, water with my left.

223
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:38,026
-Amazing.

224
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:40,796
-When one possess
two chakra natures,

225
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:45,770
it's not that difficult to use
each of them independently.

226
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:50,510
To be able to activate and use
both of them simultaneously.

227
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,883
Well, that's a different story.

228
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:58,621
-This ability to activate two
chakra natures at the same time

229
00:11:58,654 --> 00:12:03,027
in order to create a new nature
is known as Kekkei Genkai.

230
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:08,034
I think you may have heard that
term somewhere before, right?

231
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:11,173
You remember our battle
with the one called Haku?

232
00:12:11,206 --> 00:12:12,107
-Yeah.

233
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,176
-Good.

234
00:12:13,176 --> 00:12:17,081
Well, Haku had a Ice
Style Kekkei Genkai.

235
00:12:17,114 --> 00:12:20,653
He was able to manipulate water
and wind changes in chakra

236
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:23,824
simultaneously to create ice.

237
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:25,793
He could perform
such a special jutsu

238
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:30,500
because he was of a clan that
possessed that Kekkei Genkai.

239
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,870
-Haku too, huh?

240
00:12:32,903 --> 00:12:36,876
-That's why I couldn't copy
his jutsu with my Sharigan.

241
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:39,146
-Really.

242
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:41,983
Then, what about Shikamaru's
Shadow Possession Jutsu

243
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:45,121
and Choji's Expansion Jutsu.

244
00:12:45,154 --> 00:12:47,557
And what about Medical
Ninjustsu and Genjutsu.

245
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:50,462
How do they work?

246
00:12:50,496 --> 00:12:52,866
-To explain all that to
you would take more time

247
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:56,904
than we got, it would probably
only end up confusing you.

248
00:12:56,937 --> 00:13:00,610
-Hey, uh, Kakashi, I'd save
the discussion regarding

249
00:13:00,643 --> 00:13:03,747
the yin and yang of chakra
nature until next time.

250
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:04,716
-Huh?

251
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:05,717
Yin?

252
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,752
Yang?

253
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,621
What are those?

254
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:09,923
-Good point.

255
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:10,891
Forget it.

256
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:13,494
You wouldn't
understand now anyway.

257
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:14,229
[laugh]

258
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:15,497
[groan]

259
00:13:15,531 --> 00:13:17,967
-So where were we
before we got off track?

260
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:19,069
-Huh.

261
00:13:19,103 --> 00:13:20,204
Oh yeah.

262
00:13:20,204 --> 00:13:22,040
You said you knew a way
we could cheat and skip

263
00:13:22,073 --> 00:13:23,509
the training time.

264
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:25,746
-Reduce the time, not skip it.

265
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:27,181
-Yeah whatever.

266
00:13:27,214 --> 00:13:27,916
OK.

267
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:30,051
So how do we do it?

268
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:35,159
-How we do it is--
how we do it is--

269
00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:41,100
-How we do it is--
how we do it is--

270
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:42,102
-How?

271
00:13:42,102 --> 00:13:43,070
How?

272
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:45,207
-Through Multi-Shadow Clones.

273
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,709
-Huh?

274
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,243
-Yes.

275
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:49,112
Multi-Shadow clones.

276
00:13:49,146 --> 00:13:50,647
That's the secret.

277
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:52,217
-The secret to what?

278
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,087
-To significantly reducing
the amount of training time

279
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,556
you'll need.

280
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,559
-[groaning] Sorry.

281
00:13:58,593 --> 00:14:02,097
I'm not getting this at all.

282
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,566
-Right.

283
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,235
I'll explain it to you, but
you've got to pay attention.

284
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:06,237
OK.

285
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,137
-Yes, sir.

286
00:14:07,171 --> 00:14:08,840
But please keep it simple, sir.

287
00:14:08,874 --> 00:14:11,244
-I'll try.

288
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:14,214
As you know, the
Shadow Clone Jutsu

289
00:14:14,248 --> 00:14:16,851
creates actual physical
copies of yourself,

290
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:19,789
not just illusions as with
a Standard Clone Jutsu.

291
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:20,290
NARUTO: Yeah.

292
00:14:20,523 --> 00:14:20,980
Yeah.

293
00:14:21,014 --> 00:14:21,882
I know.

294
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:23,250
Of course, I know that.

295
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,423
-It allows you to duplicate
your real self many times over.

296
00:14:27,656 --> 00:14:29,960
I know this, because I can
make Shadow Clones too.

297
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:32,263
Though not nearly
as many as you can.

298
00:14:32,296 --> 00:14:37,370
But this ninjutsu also imparts
a unique effect on its user.

299
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,807
As experienced as
you are, you must

300
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,243
have picked up on it by now.

301
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:42,377
-Uh.

302
00:14:42,377 --> 00:14:44,113
-When the jutsu is
released and you're

303
00:14:44,147 --> 00:14:46,784
restored to your single
original self again,

304
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:49,387
everything that each one of
your Shadow Clones experienced

305
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:54,294
is now inside of you, stored in
your memory banks as it were.

306
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,798
-Didn't I ask you
keep it simple?

307
00:14:56,831 --> 00:14:59,134
-I guess you hadn't
picked up on that, huh?

308
00:14:59,168 --> 00:15:01,004
-I have no idea what
you're talking about.

309
00:15:01,004 --> 00:15:03,974
You lost me a long time ago.

310
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:05,177
-All right.

311
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,346
Let's both just go ahead
and make some Shadow Clones.

312
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,314
OK.

313
00:15:08,347 --> 00:15:10,284
One should be
enough for starters.

314
00:15:10,317 --> 00:15:12,053
-Right.

315
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:13,254
-(BOTH) Shadow Clone Jutsu.

316
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,227
-Good.

317
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,263
Now, we'll split up
into a team of originals

318
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:20,198
and a team of clones.

319
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:24,370
OK.

320
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:27,408
So the Shadow Clone team will go
hide in those woods over there.

321
00:15:27,408 --> 00:15:30,012
Shadow Clone Naruto,
come with me.

322
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:30,454
-Right.

323
00:15:30,454 --> 00:15:31,455
Let's go.

324
00:15:46,944 --> 00:15:48,179
There.

325
00:15:48,212 --> 00:15:50,182
Now, there's no way that the
team of originals out there

326
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:53,152
can see what the team of
clones is doing in here.

327
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,990
So now we play a game of
rock, paper, scissors.

328
00:15:56,024 --> 00:15:56,791
-We do?

329
00:15:56,824 --> 00:15:57,392
How come?

330
00:15:57,425 --> 00:15:59,228
-Never mind, just do it.

331
00:15:59,261 --> 00:16:00,797
-Wait.

332
00:16:00,797 --> 00:16:02,098
Just rock, paper, scissors.

333
00:16:02,132 --> 00:16:03,267
That's no fun.

334
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:04,869
-It's not supposed to be fun.

335
00:16:04,902 --> 00:16:06,071
-How about this?

336
00:16:06,071 --> 00:16:08,341
Loser buys the other guy
an Ichiraku Ramen lunch.

337
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:08,908
-OK.

338
00:16:08,908 --> 00:16:09,810
OK.

339
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:10,778
Fine.

340
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:12,180
Well, all right.

341
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,281
Now, it gets interesting.

342
00:16:13,315 --> 00:16:14,450
-(BOTH) One, two--

343
00:16:19,157 --> 00:16:23,028
-So what is it our Shadow Clones
are doing in there anyway?

344
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:25,432
-You'll know soon enough.

345
00:16:25,465 --> 00:16:27,201
-I won.

346
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:27,802
-Ha.

347
00:16:27,802 --> 00:16:28,870
Ha.

348
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,807
Looks like lunch is on
you, Kakashi Sensei.

349
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,441
-OK.

350
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:32,875
OK.

351
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,947
Now, let's just release this
jutsu and get out of here.

352
00:16:35,981 --> 00:16:37,249
-You got it.

353
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:47,297
-Do you know what
our clones just did?

354
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,231
-I sure do.

355
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:49,466
They played rock,
paper, scissors.

356
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:51,135
And your clone lost.

357
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:53,338
You owe me some Ichiraku Ramen.

358
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:56,442
-What he was thinking,
making deals like that?

359
00:16:56,476 --> 00:16:58,512
Anyway, you get it now, right?

360
00:16:58,746 --> 00:17:01,884
Whatever our clones experience,
we experience, all of it.

361
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:03,820
It's part of us now.

362
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,262
-Whoa.

363
00:17:04,295 --> 00:17:05,530
Yeah.

364
00:17:05,563 --> 00:17:08,200
I guess I kind of just randomly
made Shadow Clones before,

365
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:09,969
so I never really noticed.

366
00:17:10,003 --> 00:17:12,139
-Now, you see why this
jutsu was originally

367
00:17:12,173 --> 00:17:14,276
used for gathering
intelligence for things

368
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:16,012
like serving in
dangerous terrain,

369
00:17:16,045 --> 00:17:18,849
or infiltrating an
enemy stronghold.

370
00:17:18,882 --> 00:17:19,324
-OK.

371
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:20,326
Great.

372
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,427
That's all really
interesting, but I

373
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,196
don't see what it's
got to do with reducing

374
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,166
the amount of time
I'll need for training.

375
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:25,648
-Hang on.

376
00:17:25,682 --> 00:17:26,516
Don't worry.

377
00:17:26,516 --> 00:17:28,519
I was just getting to that.

378
00:17:28,552 --> 00:17:30,422
-All right.

379
00:17:30,455 --> 00:17:32,391
-Where Master Jaraiya
found the patience

380
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:35,562
to teach the Rasengan to
this kid is beyond me.

381
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,298
I mean give me a break.

382
00:17:37,332 --> 00:17:37,966
-Come on.

383
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:38,448
Come on.

384
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:39,116
Come on.

385
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,151
-OK.

386
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,621
So basically, if you
and a Shadow Clone

387
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:45,758
perform the same training
exercise at the same time,

388
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:49,364
you'll rack up twice
the experience.

389
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:53,070
To put it another way, by
training the two of you, you

390
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,206
and your Shadow
Clone simultaneously,

391
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:57,610
we can cut your
training time in half.

392
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,481
Training three of you would
take only a third of the time.

393
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:05,487
-Three of me would take
only one third of the--

394
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,358
-And a thousand would take
one thousandth of the time.

395
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:10,194
-I see.

396
00:18:10,227 --> 00:18:11,362
-Just think of it.

397
00:18:11,395 --> 00:18:13,665
Training that would normally
take two days to finish

398
00:18:13,698 --> 00:18:16,336
can be done in one
with two of you.

399
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,474
Skills that would take 20
years to master by yourself

400
00:18:19,507 --> 00:18:21,744
can be learned in a week
with a thousand clones.

401
00:18:21,777 --> 00:18:22,344
-Yeah.

402
00:18:22,378 --> 00:18:22,819
Yeah.

403
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:23,721
I get it now.

404
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:25,122
That's genius.

405
00:18:25,122 --> 00:18:26,224
-Huh.

406
00:18:26,258 --> 00:18:28,628
I was starting to think
we'd never get there.

407
00:18:28,661 --> 00:18:30,129
So that's the plan.

408
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:32,066
While we're treating
you to achieve change

409
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:35,271
in chakra nature, we'll use your
Shadow Clones the whole time.

410
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:37,407
-Sir.

411
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,645
Now, I understand how you got
to be so strong, Kakashi Sensei.

412
00:18:40,678 --> 00:18:44,451
So this is the sneaky way you've
been training all along, huh?

413
00:18:44,484 --> 00:18:45,285
-Nope.

414
00:18:45,285 --> 00:18:46,653
This'll be the first time.

415
00:18:46,686 --> 00:18:48,522
I've never tried
this method before.

416
00:18:48,556 --> 00:18:49,391
-Huh?

417
00:18:49,424 --> 00:18:50,692
But what's been stopping you?

418
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:53,362
You can make Shadow
Clones too, right?

419
00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:54,665
-Sure.

420
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:56,801
I can, but the problem is I
can't maintain them long enough

421
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,205
to put them through an
entire training regimen.

422
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:02,075
My chakra simply isn't
as powerful as yours.

423
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:04,579
And the jutsu that requires
me to divide and disperse

424
00:19:04,612 --> 00:19:07,716
my chakra into many equal
proportions isn't good for me,

425
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,521
not having a lot of
chakra to begin with.

426
00:19:10,554 --> 00:19:11,722
-Wait a minute.

427
00:19:11,756 --> 00:19:14,292
Do I really have that much
more chakra than you have,

428
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:16,295
Kakashi Sensei.

429
00:19:16,295 --> 00:19:18,332
-About four times as much.

430
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:18,855
-Yeah?

431
00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:20,258
That much?

432
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:20,925
Whoa.

433
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,594
I really am awesome, aren't I?

434
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,298
-If you weren't suppressing
the Nine-Tails' chakra,

435
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,501
you'd have about
100 times as much.

436
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:28,235
-Yeah.

437
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:30,538
The Nine-Tailed Fox.

438
00:19:30,572 --> 00:19:31,941
-That's why this
form of training

439
00:19:31,941 --> 00:19:33,542
will only work for you, Naruto.

440
00:19:36,381 --> 00:19:37,916
But because it will
require you to use

441
00:19:37,949 --> 00:19:39,752
a large amount of
chakra, there's

442
00:19:39,785 --> 00:19:42,789
a danger that the Nine-Tails
could be awakened.

443
00:19:42,822 --> 00:19:45,994
So that's why I'm
standing by, to make

444
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:50,301
sure we keep the
Nine-Tails under control.

445
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:54,306
The person who injured
Sakura was you, Naruto.

446
00:19:58,712 --> 00:20:02,484
-Thanks, Captain Yamato.

447
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:03,519
-OK then.

448
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:05,255
The first thing we
have to do is practice

449
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,925
making your chakra's
change of nature stronger.

450
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:09,895
-Right.

451
00:20:09,928 --> 00:20:11,931
-Hold this leaf
between your palms,

452
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:16,304
and using only your chakra,
tear the leaf in two.

453
00:20:16,304 --> 00:20:17,339
-You got it.

454
00:20:17,372 --> 00:20:18,841
No sweat.

455
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:20,443
-Hang on a second.

456
00:20:20,476 --> 00:20:22,479
As I said before, you'll
be doing this training

457
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,648
with Shadow Clones.

458
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:24,849
-No problem.

459
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,486
How many Shadow Clones
you want me to make?

460
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,421
-Hm.

461
00:20:28,455 --> 00:20:29,522
Well, let's see.

462
00:20:29,556 --> 00:20:34,363
If there's one of you
per leaf, that many.

463
00:20:34,396 --> 00:20:34,887
-Huh?

464
00:20:42,431 --> 00:20:43,799
-Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu.

465
00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:57,719
[grunting and struggling]

466
00:21:19,918 --> 00:21:23,455
-He's already starting to
tear some of the leaves.

467
00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:24,925
May not take as
long as I thought.

468
00:21:30,032 --> 00:21:32,101
[theme music]

469
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:12,044
SHIZUNE: We've received
disturbing news

470
00:23:12,078 --> 00:23:14,181
that a village near the
border with the Land of Fire

471
00:23:14,214 --> 00:23:16,049
has come under attack.

472
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:17,218
TSUNADE: The Akatsuki?

473
00:23:17,218 --> 00:23:18,686
SHIZUNE: No.

474
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,189
It seems to have come from the
Village Hidden in the Rain.

475
00:23:20,222 --> 00:23:21,023
TSUNADE: What?

476
00:23:21,056 --> 00:23:22,525
What could their motive be?

477
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,662
SHIZUNE: Perhaps, they're trying
to take advantage of the fact

478
00:23:24,662 --> 00:23:26,243
that the Akatsuki
are after Naruto.

479
00:23:26,243 --> 00:23:29,046
TSUNADE: Whatever it is, we
have to get to the bottom of it.

480
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,381
Summon Asuma.

481
00:23:30,381 --> 00:23:31,649
SHIZUNE: But my lady.

482
00:23:31,682 --> 00:23:32,983
TSUNADE: What?

483
00:23:33,017 --> 00:23:35,119
SHIZUNE: With Naruto here in
the village sending out any more

484
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,987
jonin could put his
safety in danger.

485
00:23:36,987 --> 00:23:39,123
NARUTO: Next Time, "Writhe."
