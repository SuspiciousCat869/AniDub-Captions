1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:09,943
‐Oh.

2
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:12,646
‐Man, I felt so useless.

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,982
All I really did out
there was get in the way.

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,218
I wish I could deal with
failure the way you do, Lee.

5
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,888
You just work up a sweat and
forget all about it, don't you?

6
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:24,324
‐I wish I could do that.

7
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,091
‐Sweat?

8
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,359
This is not sweat.

9
00:00:26,392 --> 00:00:28,394
These are tears of frustration!

10
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:29,295
‐Eh, huh!

11
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,564
‐I was no help at all.

12
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:34,100
And after you worked and
trained so hard, so hard. [sobs]

13
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:35,769
‐Yeah, I hear you.

14
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:40,040
I know exactly how you feel.

15
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,542
HINATA: Kakashi Sensei!

16
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:42,042
Are you‐‐

17
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:42,543
‐Whoa!

18
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,014
‐Uh.

19
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,516
‐Who's that?

20
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,118
‐I'm pretty sure this is
the boy we've heard about,

21
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,521
the one who possesses special
powers over the Three‐Tails.

22
00:01:07,307 --> 00:01:10,410
The Three‐Tails has
disappeared back into the lake.

23
00:01:10,443 --> 00:01:12,546
But this is far from over.

24
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:15,148
Once the Sealing Team's had
the chance to recuperate,

25
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:18,284
we'll attempt the Four‐Corner
Sealing Barrier again.

26
00:01:18,318 --> 00:01:21,555
We can't risk moving
the boy right now.

27
00:01:21,588 --> 00:01:24,525
Once he regains consciousness,
we'll take him to a safe spot

28
00:01:24,558 --> 00:01:27,093
and begin our preparations.

29
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:30,496
Meanwhile, we need
to find Naruto.

30
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:31,898
‐Naruto.

31
00:01:31,932 --> 00:01:33,199
‐Oh, don't worry.

32
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:35,301
He's probably in the lake,
working on his back stroke,

33
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:39,706
if I know him. [giggles]

34
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,143
KAKASHI: Yamato,
Sai, Kiba, Hinata.

35
00:01:43,176 --> 00:01:47,347
The four of you and I
will search for Naruto.

36
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,251
And Shizune, you'd better
come along with us, too, just

37
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:52,819
in case he's injured.

38
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:54,120
‐Hm.

39
00:01:54,154 --> 00:01:58,091
KAKASHI: Sakura and Ino will
stay here and heal the boy.

40
00:01:58,124 --> 00:02:00,727
The rest of you will
stand guard over them.

41
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:04,004
The enemy is bound to
try and get the boy back.

42
00:02:04,037 --> 00:02:05,639
‐Never fear, Sensei.

43
00:02:05,672 --> 00:02:08,108
We will protect him
with our very lives.

44
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:08,942
‐OK.

45
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:10,043
You all know what to do.

46
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:11,512
Keep on your toes.

47
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:22,455
‐Byakugan!

48
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,897
Where could he be?

49
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,175
‐Even with Hinata and
Kiba on his trail,

50
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,577
there's still no sign of him?

51
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,983
‐Ino, I know we're
both exhausted

52
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:52,152
after all we've been
through, but we've

53
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:54,287
got to watch our chakra control.

54
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,090
‐Don't worry, I
won't blow it again.

55
00:02:57,123 --> 00:03:01,234
We're not going to lose this
boy, not while I'm around.

56
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,840
‐Well, the least I can
do is lend moral support

57
00:03:06,873 --> 00:03:10,210
by executing some
mode of power squats.

58
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:11,011
‐Do you mind?

59
00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:16,416
TENTEN: Lee, we're supposed
to be guarding them, right?

60
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:18,051
‐Oh, yes, I forgot.

61
00:03:18,084 --> 00:03:20,687
‐It doesn't make sense to
all be in the same place.

62
00:03:20,721 --> 00:03:22,923
Shino is already
standing watching here.

63
00:03:22,956 --> 00:03:25,626
Why don't you and I go
take a look around outside?

64
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:27,360
‐But I‐‐ but I‐‐

65
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:29,029
TENTEN: You can
take the rooftop.

66
00:03:29,062 --> 00:03:29,963
‐Oh, good idea!

67
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:37,971
SHINO (VOICEOVER): My insects
had been drastically weakened.

68
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:40,774
Could this be another effect
of the Three‐Tails Chakra?

69
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:58,925
‐Ugh.

70
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:06,540
Where am I?

71
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,645
Oh, yeah, the last
thing I remember,

72
00:04:11,678 --> 00:04:14,014
I was being
swallowed, which means

73
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:15,716
I'm in the Three‐Tailed
Beast's belly.

74
00:04:18,318 --> 00:04:19,720
Hard as a rock.

75
00:04:19,753 --> 00:04:22,155
Talk about a cast iron stomach.

76
00:04:22,188 --> 00:04:24,490
What does this thing eat?

77
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:26,693
Oh, yeah, that'd be me.

78
00:04:36,335 --> 00:04:39,238
‐Uh, huh?

79
00:04:39,272 --> 00:04:41,742
‐You!

80
00:04:41,775 --> 00:04:43,510
Oh, so you want to‐‐ huh?

81
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:50,551
‐I'm never going to
let you have Yukimaru!

82
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:51,518
‐Yukimaru!

83
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:52,919
‐Never!

84
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:54,354
Agh, ugh!

85
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:54,855
‐Uh!

‐Damn you!

90
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:01,401
What happened?

91
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:03,570
Where the hell were you?

92
00:07:03,604 --> 00:07:06,740
‐Running out like a coward
and leaving us to fight!

93
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:08,374
‐OK, calm down.

94
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:09,710
I had no choice.

95
00:07:09,743 --> 00:07:11,845
I got an urgent
summons from Guren.

96
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:14,314
Nothing I could do about it.

97

What?

What's wrong?

‐Hm.

‐What the heck was that?

‐Huh?

104
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:27,694
What are you looking at?

00:07:31,297 --> 00:07:32,533
‐What's with you?

106
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:34,901
It's bad manners to stare.

107

‐Humph.

108
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:39,439
Funny how quickly things can
change on the battlefield.

109
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:41,608
‐Uh, meaning what?

110
00:07:41,642 --> 00:07:43,443
‐Quit your complaining.

111
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:45,378
‐Where are you going now?

112
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:48,148

[grunts]

‐That was kind of
strange, don't you think?

115
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,821
‐Rinji's lost it.

116
00:07:54,855 --> 00:07:57,691
To run away like that in
the face of the enemy.

‐Um, oh, no one.

121
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:10,577
Oh, no, please stop staring.

‐First, Rinji.

What's with you guys?

‐Listen, try looking at yourself
in the mirror some time.

‐Your chakra is fading fast.

In your case, Kiho, let's see.

Don't say it.

just do it, please!

167
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:40,240
‐Don't let it go boo!

168
00:09:40,273 --> 00:09:42,876
‐Humph.

169
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:45,178
Well, if you insist.

170
00:09:47,981 --> 00:09:49,750
‐Aah!

171
00:09:49,783 --> 00:09:50,250
Wooh!

172
00:09:57,157 --> 00:09:57,991
‐Ugh!

173
00:09:58,024 --> 00:09:59,359
He's being used,
and you know it!

174
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:00,894
He believes there's
someone out there

175
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:03,804
he can go back to‐‐
someone he could trust.

176
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,507
But he's going to betrayed.

177
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,943
And when that moment comes,
he won't have anywhere

178
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,312
left to turn.

179
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,380
If wherever someone
thinks of you as a place

180
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:18,519
you can call home,
well, then I am not

181
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:21,121
going to stop
thinking about him.

182
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:24,591
SAKURA: So this is who
Naruto was thinking about.

183
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,391
‐What?

184
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,193
‐Huh?

185
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,161
Oh, nothing.

186
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,996
I was just thinking
that Naruto was

187
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,565
going to be worried
about this kid.

188
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:31,965
YUKIMARU: Hmm.

189
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:32,432
‐Uh!

190
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:36,937
‐Where am I?

191
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,471
‐You're with friends.

192
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,707
We're going to protect
you from now on.

193
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:41,341
‐Protect?

194
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,276
What do you mean?

195
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,011
[gasps]

196
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:45,579
Where is it?

197
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:46,613
It's gone!

198
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:47,714
‐What is it?

199
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:48,481
What's wrong?

200
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,150
Did you lose something?

201
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,417
‐Where is it?

202
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:54,354
It's gone.

203
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,822
It's gone.

204
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:56,790
It's gone!

‐This must be‐‐ uh.

206
00:11:11,678 --> 00:11:14,781
That's Yukimaru.

207
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,036
Then that means she‐‐

208
00:11:18,036 --> 00:11:21,922
she must be, uh‐‐ [sobs]

You've forgiven me.

‐You have taken life.

212
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:40,641
You have the audacity
to ask such a thing.

213
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:41,942
‐Huh?

214
00:11:41,975 --> 00:11:44,711
‐You expect forgiveness.

215
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,579
‐No!

216
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:47,047

You put this bandage on me?

Why?

‐You're a liar!

Your opponent lies helpless.

And I'm supposed to
believe that you've

passed up the chance to‐‐

‐Believe it or not, that's
not the way I do things.

We were the only ones
who were swallowed.

It's just you and me.

be by the lake.

NARUTO: Maybe.

245
00:12:52,886 --> 00:12:55,856
Unless your friends got to him.

246
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:57,157
Or mine.

247
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,926
They would have taken him
back to the village by now.

GUREN: If that's the case, as
soon as I thrash you and get

249
00:13:03,036 --> 00:13:06,406
out of here, I'll take him back.

No matter how you
slice it, we're

going to have a
fight because that's

the only way this
can be settled.

Either I beat you
or you beat me.

But only one of us
walks out of here.

Yeah, I suppose you're right.

‐Agh!

What are these things?

263
00:13:34,535 --> 00:13:37,704
They're like the Three‐Tailed
Beast, only smaller.

Nyeeh, nyah!

In your condition?

273

See?

‐That's a lovely crystal.

‐Not a scratch on it.

He truly believes that

there he can go back to.

300

You could have left
me to those creatures.

310
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:39,472
‐And I'd have to watch.

311
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,141
No, thank you.

312
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,710
‐Huh, you're a fool.

‐Humph.

314
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:48,982
‐If I'd have been in your
place, you'd be dead by now.

315
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:52,519
And I'd be out of here
and looking for Yukimaru.

316
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:55,856
‐I guess you must want
him real bad, huh?

317
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,323
Or Orochimaru does.

318
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:02,669
‐You're one to talk.

319
00:16:02,703 --> 00:16:04,204
Now, that you've
seen his powers,

320
00:16:04,237 --> 00:16:06,406
you want him just as badly!

321
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:08,474
No wonder, having
the Three‐Tails

322
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,244
would give the Leaf Village
unrivaled military power!

323
00:16:11,277 --> 00:16:13,880
‐That's not something
we have a need for.

324

‐You lie!

325

Everyone knows your
village already

326
00:16:17,283 --> 00:16:20,053
has the Nine‐Tails and
its jinchuriki host.

327
00:16:20,086 --> 00:16:25,959
The Leaf has no right to
criticize Orochimaru‐‐

328
00:16:25,992 --> 00:16:29,062
I mean, us, for wanting
what you already have.

329
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:31,698
‐As for the jinchuriki,
you're looking at him!

330
00:16:31,732 --> 00:16:32,198
‐What?

331
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:40,140
‐I have power.

332
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:41,942
But I'm not going to use it.

333
00:16:44,678 --> 00:16:47,247
Power that you wouldn't believe.

334
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,450
So much power that I'm
not able to control it.

335
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:53,286
I nearly killed my
friends before I even

336
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:55,355
knew what I was doing.

337
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:58,625
And that's why I don't
dare use it ever again.

338
00:17:02,302 --> 00:17:05,772
I wish I had never
said that to him.

339
00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:06,272
‐Uh?

340
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,112
‐Because wherever someone
is still thinking of you,

341
00:17:12,145 --> 00:17:14,648
that place is your home.

342
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:17,918
‐So if somebody somewhere is
thinking about me, wherever

343
00:17:17,951 --> 00:17:22,923
that person is is
where I belong.

344
00:17:22,956 --> 00:17:24,758
‐It was you?

345
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,292
You told him?

346
00:17:26,326 --> 00:17:29,630
‐Yeah, but if you've been
thinking about him only

347
00:17:29,663 --> 00:17:32,966
because you want to use him
as a pawn for Orochimaru

348
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:37,070
because he could control the
Three‐Tails, that's wrong!

349
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:46,146
I don't want Yukimaru
anywhere near a Tailed Beast.

350
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:48,782
I don't want him
becoming like me.

351
00:17:48,815 --> 00:17:52,385
‐I swear I would never let
that happen to Yukimaru.

352
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:52,886
Never!

353
00:17:55,889 --> 00:17:58,391
‐I don't believe you.

354
00:17:58,424 --> 00:18:03,103
‐Giving him a place to return
to, that's all I'm doing.

355
00:18:03,136 --> 00:18:07,140
When Yukimaru lost his
mother, he lost the one place

356
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,109
in the world where he belonged.

357
00:18:09,142 --> 00:18:11,512
I'm trying to give
that back to him.

358
00:18:11,545 --> 00:18:14,280
‐Yeah, right‐‐ when
you're working Orochimaru!

359
00:18:14,314 --> 00:18:16,382
Lady, whatever else you
are, you are definitely

360
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,651
not where he belongs!

361
00:18:17,684 --> 00:18:19,720
And I'm going to make him
see that once and for all!

362
00:18:19,753 --> 00:18:20,420
‐Go ahead!

363
00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:22,556
Do what you want!

364
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:23,323
Go on!

365
00:18:23,356 --> 00:18:25,491
Maybe you're right.

366
00:18:25,526 --> 00:18:27,990
But that boy‐‐

367
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:33,867
all I know is
Yukimaru is where I belong!

368
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,367
‐You?

369
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:42,475
Anyway, we can argue
about that another time.

370
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:45,011
While you were out of it, I
took a look around this place.

371
00:18:45,045 --> 00:18:46,713
And I've got tell
you, I couldn't

372
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:48,048
make heads or tails of it.

373
00:18:48,081 --> 00:18:51,184
And I couldn't find
a way out anywhere.

374
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:53,920
We'll split up to
cover more ground.

375
00:18:53,954 --> 00:18:55,455
‐What?

376
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:58,525
How much can we
cover, just two of us?

377
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,760
‐Who said two?

378
00:18:59,793 --> 00:19:02,235
I'm thinking more like 1,000.

379
00:19:02,268 --> 00:19:04,571
‐Huh?

380
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:07,874
‐Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

[men screaming]

382
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:20,754
‐All right, you
three, your orders

383
00:19:20,787 --> 00:19:24,090
are take Yukimaru away
from the Leaf ninja.

384
00:19:24,124 --> 00:19:25,425
Use whatever means necessary.

385
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,328
Only get him back!

386
00:19:28,361 --> 00:19:30,831

‐Go and enjoy the
power I've given you.

389
00:19:55,656 --> 00:19:57,057
Have fun with it.

HINATA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

391
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,986
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Where are you, Naruto?

392
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,922
‐Welcome to the
Naruto Cup Challenge!

393
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:24,691
"The first who can be
the one to find a way out

395
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:29,863
Are the runners ready?

396
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:30,396
CLONES: Yeah!

397
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,367
‐Everybody on your marks!

398
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,708
Get set, go!

399
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:49,449
With these many guys
searching, we'll

400
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,251
find a way out in no time.

401
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:52,853
‐You mean, I'll find it!

402
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:54,187
‐No, I will.

403

GUREN (VOICEOVER): Got to
get out and find Yukimaru.

404
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:57,791
I don't care how.

405
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:58,291
‐Gangway!

406
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,270
‐I've got it!

407
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,238
I've got it.

408
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:06,740
I know where Guren must be.

409
00:21:06,773 --> 00:21:07,708
‐Huh?

410
00:21:07,741 --> 00:21:10,210
‐And I bet Naruto's
there with her.

411
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:13,213
They're stuck in the
Three‐Tails' tummy.

412
00:21:13,246 --> 00:21:16,182
‐Huh?

413
00:21:16,216 --> 00:21:17,684
‐[chuckles]

[music playing]

419
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:03,169
SAKURA: Yukimaru thinks
that Guren, the woman who

420
00:23:03,203 --> 00:23:05,506
uses the Crystal
Style, is still alive.

421
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:07,440
KAKASHI: And that she
and Naruto were actually

422
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:09,142
swallowed by the Three‐Tails?

423
00:23:09,175 --> 00:23:10,511
Stranger things have happened.

424
00:23:10,544 --> 00:23:14,014
But if so, what makes you
so sure Guren is alive?

425
00:23:14,047 --> 00:23:15,381
YUKIMARU: The crystal.

426
00:23:15,415 --> 00:23:18,785
If anything had happened to
Guren, it would have shattered.

427
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:20,887
YAMATO: That doesn't
mean Naruto's all right.

428
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:22,656
KAKASHI: We just have
to trust that he is

429
00:23:22,689 --> 00:23:25,458
and that we find the
Three‐Tails first.
