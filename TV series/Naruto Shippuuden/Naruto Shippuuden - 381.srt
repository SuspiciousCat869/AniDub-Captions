1
00:00:09,024 --> 00:00:10,994
So will you give
me a fist bump?

2
00:00:11,796 --> 00:00:12,730
Yeah!

3
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,201
{\an1}Yeah, let's try it!

4
00:00:32,835 --> 00:00:35,506
{\an1}'Cause we can do anything
if we borrow Nine Tails', I

5
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,178
{\an1}mean, Kurama's power.

6
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,447
Right!

7
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,516
{\an1}Then let's all four
of us join forces now!

8
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,153
{\an1}"All four of us?"

9
00:00:42,187 --> 00:00:44,958
{\an1}You treat us like
we're human, too!

10
00:00:44,992 --> 00:00:47,563
What kind of
childrearing led to this?!

11
00:00:47,596 --> 00:00:49,000
[chuckling]

12
00:00:51,604 --> 00:00:52,740
Naruto...

13
00:00:54,343 --> 00:00:56,147
I wish there
were more time

14
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,916
{\an1}to talk to the grown-up you!

15
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,521
{\an1}Yeah, me, too, but
guys don't need to talk!

16
00:01:00,554 --> 00:01:02,191
{\an1}Plus, I already know!

17
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,102
I...

18
00:01:09,104 --> 00:01:11,742
I already met
Mom's chakra, dad.

19
00:01:12,878 --> 00:01:14,782
{\an1}What you want to say
to me is the same as

20
00:01:14,815 --> 00:01:16,919
{\an1}my talkative mom, right?

21
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,588
{\an1}See, I already know!

22
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:21,462
[chuckle]

23
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:38,861
This feeling...

24
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:40,630
{\an1}It's so familiar.

25
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:45,005
{\an1}Even though we have few
options, it feels like we

26
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,009
{\an1}can accomplish anything.

27
00:01:49,314 --> 00:01:50,716
That's right!

28
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:54,224
{\an1}This feels just like
when I was with Kushina.

29
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,881
I feel power
welling up inside me!

30
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:09,018
{\an1}Come on, let's go!

31
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:12,558
Naruto's got
this much chakra?

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,529
Naruto!

33
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:17,434
{\an1}Shouting and showing off is
all well and good but don't

34
00:02:17,468 --> 00:02:21,375
{\an1}tell me you've forgotten
that nothing other than Sage

35
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,846
{\an1}Jutsu is going to
work against this guy!

36
00:02:24,514 --> 00:02:26,150
{\an1}I know you're not an idiot!

37
00:02:36,836 --> 00:02:38,173
That's right!

38
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,311
Okay...

39
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:42,113
{\an1}You're a bigger idiot
than my elder brother!

40
00:02:42,147 --> 00:02:45,554
{\an1}All that Chakra and
it's being wasted on him.

41
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:48,859
Or perhaps not
quite the same feeling.

42
00:02:50,028 --> 00:02:51,665
[laughter]

43
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:56,274
{\an1}You've sure surpassed
all the previous Hokage!

44
00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:58,078
{\an1}'Least, in stupidity!

45
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,880
Shut up!

46
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:01,818
Stupid Kurama!

47
00:03:02,151 --> 00:03:03,588
[laughter]

48
00:03:03,622 --> 00:03:06,760
{\an1}Fools are easily liked
and trusted by others.

49
00:03:06,793 --> 00:03:08,732
{\an1}But don't you mind that.

50
00:03:08,764 --> 00:03:10,701
{\an1}There's no need to worry.

51
00:03:10,736 --> 00:03:13,674
{\an1}I'm not worried that
I'm an idiot, you know!

52
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:14,976
Not at all!

53
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,445
No, not that.

54
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,615
Huh?

55
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:20,887
{\an1}I'm saying that you might
be able to go into Sage Mode

56
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,225
{\an1}while in Tailed Beast State.

57
00:03:23,258 --> 00:03:24,695
[gasp]

58
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:28,201
{\an1}Listen, you may have
forgotten, but it happened

59
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:31,508
{\an1}during your final
battle with Pain.

60
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,645
That is, Nagato.

61
00:03:36,618 --> 00:03:40,023
{\an1}I got so mad at what he was
saying that my chakra leaked

62
00:03:40,057 --> 00:03:44,432
{\an1}out, even though you were
in Sage Mode at the time.

63
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:48,606
{\an1}My power and your
Sage Power actually

64
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,944
{\an1}managed to synchronize.

65
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:57,089
{\an1}Did something like
that happen back then?

66
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,218
{\an1}You say that, but back
when I was undergoing Sage

67
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:14,857
{\an1}Training, you interfered
with Gramps Sage's

68
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,993
{\an1}Sage Jutsu, remember?!

69
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:19,131
That's because I
had no interest in

70
00:04:19,164 --> 00:04:21,603
{\an1}sharing space with toads!

71
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:25,041
{\an1}Besides, it really pissed me
off that you would rely on

72
00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:28,682
Sage Jutsu when
you had my chakra.

73
00:04:28,716 --> 00:04:30,720
[chuckle]

74
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,592
{\an1}You're a real stubborn
bastard, aren't you?

75
00:04:33,626 --> 00:04:36,230
{\an1}No, you're the stubborn one!

76
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:39,503
{\an1}Anyway, I'm trying to say
I'm willing to let you use

77
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:42,308
both my power
and Sage Power.

78
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:44,111
What's stubborn
about that, damn it?!

79
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:47,952
[chuckle]

80
00:04:47,985 --> 00:04:50,290
{\an1}You just can't be upfront
about your feelings, huh?

81
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,392
You bastard!

82
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,996
{\an1}You've sure been making
fun of me a lot lately!

83
00:04:57,102 --> 00:05:00,309
{\an1}No, it's done out
of familiarity.

84
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,144
{\an1}[annoyed harrumph]

85
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:07,590
{\an1}Ready for Tailed Beast
State with Sage Jutsu?

86
00:05:07,623 --> 00:05:10,596
{\an1}You both have the
same me inside.

87
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:13,400
{\an1}You can give powerful
support to your son.

88
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,404
Yeah.

89
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,811
Of course, I
already knew that!

90
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,397
I'll have some
jutsu prepared, too!

91
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:34,741
{\an1}I'm absorbing Nature Energy
a lot faster in this state.

92
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:48,199
All right!

93
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,312
Naruto!

94
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,117
Add Sage Jutsu
to the Rasengan!

95
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,152
Okay!

96
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:03,389
{\an1}Now, Old Man Second!

97
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,295
Let's do it!

98
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:10,402
{\an1}Just forge ahead!

99
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:13,776
{\an1}We'll ward off his
attacks with our chakra!

100
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:27,501
Rasengan!

101
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:38,189
[power yell]

102
00:09:04,571 --> 00:09:06,742
That black thing
sure is solid! Darn it!

103
00:09:06,776 --> 00:09:08,880
He used it
defensively this time.

104
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,553
{\an1}He predicted our attack.

105
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:15,994
{\an1}Using only Flying
Raijin won't be enough.

106
00:09:16,027 --> 00:09:17,997
{\an1}What we need to do
is wreck that black

107
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,334
{\an1}thing, that's all!

108
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,070
But how?

109
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:23,541
{\an1}All right, then for
this next time...

110
00:09:23,574 --> 00:09:26,847
{\an1}Let's try adding Sage Jutsu
to a Tailed Beast Bomb!

111
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:30,288
Nice!

112
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:31,289
Good thinking!

113
00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:33,893
{\an1}You might just become
a greater Hokage

114
00:09:33,927 --> 00:09:35,430
{\an1}than Elder Brother.

115
00:09:40,807 --> 00:09:42,210
{\an1}Hey, other Kurama!

116
00:09:42,243 --> 00:09:43,545
You help, too!

117
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:44,547
Yeah, of course!

118
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:45,883
You got it!

119
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,687
I thought so...

120
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,858
{\an1}This is a familiar
feeling after all!

121
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:04,252
This is what
Naruto's capable of now?

122
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:08,260
{\an1}With perfect control
over this much chakra?

123
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:10,596
{\an1}How far will you go...

124
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,561
{\an1}There's no harm in
taking measures early.

125
00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:36,011
[gasp]

126
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:37,381
What's that?!

127
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:46,097
{\an1}He's launching the
Infinite Tsukuyomi already?!

128
00:11:08,974 --> 00:11:11,112
He just spit out
the Ten Tails?!

129
00:11:11,746 --> 00:11:12,648
Be careful.

130
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:13,850
{\an1}This looks bad...

131
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:53,359
I'll suspend the
barrier for now.

132
00:12:00,538 --> 00:12:02,342
The barrier's
disappearing!

133
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:06,082
{\an1}Then we can fight alongside
Naruto and the others!

134
00:12:11,493 --> 00:12:12,862
[gasps]

135
00:12:30,562 --> 00:12:32,031
Th- This is!

136
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:43,152
Huh?! What?!

137
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:45,924
{\an1}[discomforted yell]

138
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:51,602
Run quick!

139
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:54,374
{\an1}It sucks out all your chakra
in one swoop and kills you!

140
00:13:00,452 --> 00:13:01,955
{\an1}It's going after all
of us and taking us

141
00:13:01,988 --> 00:13:03,558
{\an1}down, one by one!

142
00:13:07,365 --> 00:13:08,869
But why?!

143
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:12,941
{\an1}Why do I get so many
of 'em coming after me?

144
00:13:13,744 --> 00:13:15,347
Fool, ya fool!

145
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:18,821
That thing is
called the Divine Tree.

146
00:13:19,154 --> 00:13:21,258
{\an1}It's Ten Tails' final form!

147
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,029
{\an1}It can tell that you have
more chakra than almost

148
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:26,334
{\an1}anyone else around here!

149
00:13:26,368 --> 00:13:28,972
{\an1}At this rate, the chakra
that Naruto shared with

150
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:31,177
{\an1}everyone is meaningless.

151
00:13:35,452 --> 00:13:37,722
{\an1}Just what exactly is this?!

152
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:42,164
{\an1}Chakra first originated
with this Divine Tree!

153
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:46,706
{\an1}All the chakra that is
even the vast amounts

154
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:48,342
{\an1}of chakra you possess.

155
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:50,246
{\an1}What're you saying?!

156
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,920
{\an1}We humans stole chakra from
the Divine Tree long ago.

157
00:13:53,954 --> 00:13:57,527
{\an1}This thing is merely trying
to get it back, that is all.

158
00:13:57,827 --> 00:13:59,263
{\an1}What's that mean?!

159
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,267
{\an1}The endless passage
of time has cast an

160
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,638
obfuscating fog
over the facts.

161
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:08,113
{\an1}Do you know how and
why shinobi came

162
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:09,650
{\an1}to be, Hashirama?

163
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:15,026
{\an1}Long ago, before they even
had the faintest concept of

164
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:19,334
{\an1}chakra, people still
continuously waged battle

165
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:22,808
{\an1}against each other.

166
00:14:26,582 --> 00:14:29,855
{\an1}The Divine Tree, which
had no involvement in such

167
00:14:29,888 --> 00:14:32,293
conflicts, was
worshipped by the

168
00:14:32,326 --> 00:14:34,597
{\an1}masses as a sacred pillar.

169
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:36,868
Then one day...

170
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:42,645
{\an1}The Divine Tree bore a fruit
that was said to be produced

171
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:45,083
{\an1}only once in a millennium.

172
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,489
{\an1}I don't know what if any
significance it holds, but

173
00:14:48,523 --> 00:14:52,464
{\an1}legend said that the fruit
was never to be touched.

174
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:57,040
{\an1}But there emerged a princess
who took and tasted of that

175
00:14:57,074 --> 00:15:00,512
{\an1}fruit in order to reap the
tree's power and win the war

176
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:02,516
{\an1}that she was fighting.

177
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,862
{\an1}Afterward, she gained the
power of a god, and was said

178
00:15:08,895 --> 00:15:11,700
{\an1}to have quashed the
war all by herself.

179
00:15:13,004 --> 00:15:15,808
Her name was
Kaguya Otsutsuki.

180
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,914
{\an1}Oh so that's how!

181
00:15:18,948 --> 00:15:22,454
{\an1}She's the first person
to ever have chakra.

182
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:28,298
{\an1}Eventually, Kaguya would
bear a child who was born

183
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:32,272
{\an1}with chakra already
dwelling within him.

184
00:15:32,908 --> 00:15:36,180
{\an1}However, the Divine Tree
came alive and started

185
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:39,988
{\an1}running amok in order to
reclaim its stolen chakra.

186
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:42,592
{\an1}That is Ten Tails.

187
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:46,701
{\an1}And the one who stopped
it was Kaguya's child.

188
00:15:47,034 --> 00:15:49,973
His name was
Hagoromo Otsutsuki.

189
00:15:51,109 --> 00:15:53,345
{\an1}He's the forefather who
preached the teachings of

190
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:56,820
chakra and began
the sect of shinobi.

191
00:15:57,153 --> 00:16:00,258
{\an1}The man known as the
Sage of Six Paths.

192
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:02,697
[gasp]

193
00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:04,500
How do you
know such things?

194
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:05,970
How could you?!

195
00:16:06,003 --> 00:16:08,608
{\an1}It's so inscribed on
the Uchiha Stone Tablet.

196
00:16:12,683 --> 00:16:14,954
{\an1}Now, do I need to explain
what happened to those who

197
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:17,425
{\an1}tasted of the forbidden
fruit for the purpose of

198
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,763
ending conflict?

199
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:27,477
That's right.

200
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,047
Nothing changed.

201
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:33,421
{\an1}In fact, subsequent wars
become even more gruesome!

202
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,563
{\an1}Upon learning this,
I fell into despair.

203
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,769
{\an1}There are no such things
as true dreams in

204
00:16:40,803 --> 00:16:42,740
{\an1}this world, Hashirama!

205
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:45,645
{\an1}From the time people tasted
of the fruit, humans have

206
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:50,988
{\an1}been cursed and destined to
hate each other even more.

207
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:55,730
{\an1}It is we shinobi whose
existence symbolizes that

208
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,036
foolishness,
don't you think?

209
00:16:59,471 --> 00:17:01,142
In which case I
would rather....

210
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:04,080
{\an1}Relying on the power
of the Divine Tree

211
00:17:04,113 --> 00:17:05,549
{\an1}for your great genjutsu.

212
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:09,324
{\an1}You simply cannot see it.

213
00:17:09,356 --> 00:17:11,360
{\an1}What's even further ahead.

214
00:17:12,495 --> 00:17:14,766
{\an1}Dreams of the far future.

215
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,849
{\an1}Is this what you meant by
"dreams of the far future?!"

216
00:17:25,487 --> 00:17:26,756
Yes...

217
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:29,829
{\an1}Although, there's
one thing that's off.

218
00:17:30,163 --> 00:17:31,299
Huh?!

219
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,937
[screaming]

220
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:35,673
Naruto!

221
00:17:35,706 --> 00:17:36,508
No!

222
00:17:37,442 --> 00:17:39,080
{\an1}Water Style: Severing Wave!

223
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,229
Damn it!

224
00:17:47,262 --> 00:17:48,564
{\an1}There're too many!

225
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:50,869
{\an1}I might be able to sense
Naruto but it's useless!

226
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:52,004
Wait!

227
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,173
Lord Fourth!

228
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,676
Can you teleport
right to Naruto?!

229
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,146
I can't!

230
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,417
{\an1}That last Flying Raijin
and these vines have

231
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:00,119
{\an1}depleted my chakra!

232
00:18:01,423 --> 00:18:02,657
In that case...

233
00:18:08,068 --> 00:18:10,373
{\an1}No, let go of me!

234
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,892
Gramps!

235
00:18:24,332 --> 00:18:26,436
I'm sorry that
it took so long!

236
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:28,573
Saru!

237
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:29,976
You're here!

238
00:18:31,245 --> 00:18:32,214
Good!

239
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:33,383
{\an1}Let's teleport away!

240
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:43,735
Have things
finally settled down?

241
00:18:44,704 --> 00:18:46,341
[gasp]

242
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:40,109
{\an1}Is this what you meant by
"dreams of the far future?!"

243
00:19:41,411 --> 00:19:42,547
Yes...

244
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,486
{\an1}Although, there's
one thing that's off.

245
00:19:45,753 --> 00:19:47,857
{\an1}What do you mean?

246
00:19:47,891 --> 00:19:49,059
Take a look.

247
00:20:00,915 --> 00:20:04,054
{\an1}When this Divine Tree's
bud finally blooms,

248
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:07,060
{\an1}the moon will reflect the
eye at the flower's center

249
00:20:07,093 --> 00:20:10,400
{\an1}and the Infinite Tsukuyomi
will be fully activated.

250
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:16,912
{\an1}And I will be the
one to accomplish it!

251
00:20:17,846 --> 00:20:18,982
We're doomed!

252
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,921
This is crazy...

253
00:20:23,525 --> 00:20:24,759
Sakura!

254
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:26,263
{\an1}Sakura, are you all right?!

255
00:20:32,342 --> 00:20:34,278
Man that was a
one close call!

256
00:20:34,312 --> 00:20:35,481
Fool, ya fool!

257
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:38,654
[gasp]

258
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:39,855
So close!

259
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:43,963
{\an1}Is it all over yet?!

260
00:21:02,064 --> 00:21:03,033
Now...

261
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:05,672
...be still.

262
00:21:10,347 --> 00:21:16,224
You've all...

263
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:18,094
{\an1}Endured plenty already.

264
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,754
{\an1}<i>Shinobi are all done for.</i>

265
00:22:59,787 --> 00:23:01,892
<i>There's no need</i>
<i>to keep going.</i>

266
00:23:01,925 --> 00:23:04,396
<i>If you don't</i>
<i>resist, I won't kill you.</i>

267
00:23:05,498 --> 00:23:09,472
{\an1}<i>Regret will fill you unless</i>
<i>you stop and do nothing.</i>

268
00:23:09,506 --> 00:23:12,645
<i>No more fearing</i>
<i>death or enduring pain.</i>

269
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:14,749
{\an1}<i>You'll be entering a dream.</i>

270
00:23:14,783 --> 00:23:18,422
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "A</i>
<i>Shinobi's Dream."</i>

271
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,729
<i>That is our true</i>
<i>dream as shinobi!</i>
