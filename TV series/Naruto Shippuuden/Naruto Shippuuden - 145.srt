1
00:00:15,342 --> 00:00:19,143
- So,
the girl has bodyguards now.

2
00:00:19,143 --> 00:00:21,279
I never imagined
that the Hidden Leaf

3
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,447
{\an1}would reach her so quickly.

4
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:25,682
- Even so,
there's only four of them.

5
00:00:25,682 --> 00:00:27,650
{\an1}I say we get rid of them
and take the forbidden jutsu

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,352
from the girl.

7
00:00:29,352 --> 00:00:31,586
{\an1}-Don't be so impatient.

8
00:00:31,586 --> 00:00:33,955
{\an1}- What's the plan going to
be, then?

9
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:35,990
{\an1}- That forbidden jujitsu is
worth far more than money

10
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,724
{\an1}to every one of us.

11
00:00:37,724 --> 00:00:40,192
{\an1}We cannot afford to fail.

12
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,894
{\an1}During the last Great Ninja
War, that jutsu

13
00:00:41,894 --> 00:00:45,229
{\an1}revealed its unbelievable power.

14
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:47,797
{\an1}If we can just find a way
to get our hands on it,

15
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,566
{\an1}we could go from a
little band of thieves

16
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:52,301
{\an1}to powerful lords
of our own domains.

17
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:55,236
- But the people
from the Hidden Leaf,

18
00:00:55,236 --> 00:00:57,571
{\an1}could they have the
forbidden jutsu?

19
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:59,306
-It's unlikely.

20
00:00:59,306 --> 00:01:02,275
{\an1}The previous Hokage
and En no Gyoja

21
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:04,476
{\an1}forged a secret treaty to
protect it at all costs,

22
00:01:04,476 --> 00:01:06,143
{\an1}so the Leaf wouldn't keep it.

23
00:01:06,143 --> 00:01:07,678
{\an1}They're merely fulfilling
their obligation

24
00:01:07,678 --> 00:01:10,413
{\an1}to keep the jutsu safe.

25
00:01:10,413 --> 00:01:13,181
{\an1}- Still, if they were entrusted
to uphold that treaty,

26
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:15,584
{\an1}then they must be very skilled.

27
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:16,718
{\an1}Do we really want
to mess with them?

28
00:01:16,718 --> 00:01:18,686
-Yeah.

29
00:01:18,686 --> 00:01:21,254
{\an1}And they'll probably
call reinforcements, too.

30
00:01:21,254 --> 00:01:23,790
- Nango, Benten,
are you planning on losing

31
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,858
{\an1}the fight before it even begins?

32
00:01:25,858 --> 00:01:28,059
{\an1}- I always thought it
was just your face,

33
00:01:28,059 --> 00:01:29,861
{\an1}but your head's got
something wrong with it, too.

34
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:31,428
{\an1}-What did you say?

35
00:01:31,428 --> 00:01:33,597
{\an1}- Just think about
all the possibilities.

36
00:01:33,597 --> 00:01:35,197
Use your head.

37
00:01:35,197 --> 00:01:36,666
{\an1}-Enough with the fighting.

38
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,000
We are a team.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,768
{\an1}Don't you forget that.

40
00:01:39,768 --> 00:01:41,802
{\an1}None of us are expendable.

41
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:44,737
{\an1}It's been our unity and
our combination jutsu that

42
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,072
{\an1}have kept us alive through
these difficult times.

43
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:49,908
-All right.

44
00:01:49,908 --> 00:01:52,109
{\an1}- There's no need to
rush into anything.

45
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:54,578
I already know
their destination.

46
00:01:54,578 --> 00:01:57,479
{\an1}They're headed to the hideaway
of the Tsuchigumo clan,

47
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,815
{\an1}and the best part is,
once they drop the girl there,

48
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:00,916
they'll simply
leave on their own.

49
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:03,116
-OK.

50
00:02:03,116 --> 00:02:05,686
{\an1}But won't there be trouble
if they enter the village?

51
00:02:05,686 --> 00:02:10,455
{\an1}- Akaboshi, you still don't
understand human nature.

52
00:02:10,455 --> 00:02:14,725
{\an1}To us, that forbidden jutsu
is treasure beyond compare.

53
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:15,593
{\an1}But to everyone else,
it's nothing but a nuisance.

54
00:02:19,662 --> 00:02:22,097
[theme music]

55
00:04:22,648 --> 00:04:25,483
[crash]

56
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:27,052
{\an1}- What the heck did
you do that for?

57
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:29,086
{\an1}-That's what I wanna ask you.

58
00:04:29,086 --> 00:04:30,921
Just why are you
guys following me?

59
00:04:30,921 --> 00:04:32,655
{\an1}-What do you mean?

60
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:34,389
{\an1}We're here because
we're your bodyguards.

61
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:36,124
{\an1}- How many times do
I need to say it?

62
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:37,425
{\an1}I don't need any bodyguards.

63
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:40,661
{\an1}I'm able to protect
myself just fine.

64
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:45,031
{\an1}So, all of you Hidden
Leaf ninja can leave now.

65
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:47,800
{\an1}NARUTO: Look, we can't just
say, oh, OK, bye, and leave.

66
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,133
HOTARU: Why not?

67
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:48,933
Really.

68
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,568
Please.

69
00:04:50,568 --> 00:04:52,003
I don't want you
bothering me anymore.

70
00:04:52,003 --> 00:04:53,103
{\an1}NARUTO: It's not bothering.

71
00:04:53,103 --> 00:04:55,038
{\an1}It's called guarding.

72
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:56,839
{\an1}YAMATO: Oh, well.

73
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,808
{\an1}I guess we'd better just
do as she says and leave.

74
00:04:59,808 --> 00:05:00,175
-What?

75
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:00,975
How come?

76
00:05:00,975 --> 00:05:02,910
{\an1}-We have no choice.

77
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,478
{\an1}- Just wait here a
second, would ya?

78
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:07,180
-Are you sure?

79
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,780
the enemy could
still be close by.

80
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,848
-Don't worry.

81
00:05:09,848 --> 00:05:12,683
-Hm?

82
00:05:12,683 --> 00:05:14,651
Hey!

83
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:16,453
OK, then.

84
00:05:16,453 --> 00:05:18,253
{\an1}I guess we're gonna
get going now.

85
00:05:18,253 --> 00:05:18,353
-Fine.

86
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,962
[scream]

87
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:30,930
-Get it off me!

88
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,863
Get it off me!

89
00:05:31,863 --> 00:05:32,263
Get it off me!

90
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:36,366
-There.

91
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:38,468
It's gone.

92
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:40,203
{\an1}-That... that was horrible.

93
00:05:40,203 --> 00:05:41,269
What was it?

94
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:43,071
{\an1}-A mountain leech.

95
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:45,239
{\an1}There are actually a whole
lot of them around here,

96
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:47,975
{\an1}so they just come raining
down on you all the time.

97
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:49,043
-Raining down?

98
00:05:49,043 --> 00:05:50,043
NARUTO: Yep.

99
00:05:50,043 --> 00:05:51,477
Well, see ya.

100
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:55,279
Be careful out
here all by your...

101
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,849
{\an1}What the heck you do that for?

102
00:05:57,849 --> 00:05:58,882
-Please, Naruto.

103
00:05:58,882 --> 00:06:01,184
Stay with me?

104
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:02,885
{\an1}I could never touch
anything as gross as that.

105
00:06:02,885 --> 00:06:04,120
I can't.

106
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,954
{\an1}It's simply impossible.

107
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:07,756
{\an1}If it's going to rain
leeches, can you

108
00:06:07,756 --> 00:06:09,523
{\an1}please stay and block
them, Naruto?

109
00:06:09,523 --> 00:06:11,992
{\an1}- But you said you
didn't need a bodyguard.

110
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:13,226
{\an1}- Just until we get
out of this forest.

111
00:06:13,226 --> 00:06:14,160
-I don't know.

112
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,894
{\an1}It's a tough call.

113
00:06:15,894 --> 00:06:16,661
-Please, Naruto!

114
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:19,530
Please!

115
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,065
{\an1}-I guess I could.

116
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:21,999
If you want.

117
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:29,570
- You know,
now that I think about it,

118
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,571
I guess Utakata
would probably still

119
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:33,240
{\an1}be my bodyguard if all you
Hidden Leaf guys hadn't

120
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,474
{\an1}shown up and taken over for him.

121
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:37,610
-Utakata?

122
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,978
{\an1}You mean the guy that does
that weird bubble jutsu?

123
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:43,380
{\an1}- He's the man that
I consider my master.

124
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,948
{\an1}I hope I can become
as strong as he is.

125
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:46,282
Well, someday.

126
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:48,084
-Hm.

127
00:06:48,084 --> 00:06:50,218
{\an1}Your master, huh?

128
00:06:50,218 --> 00:06:53,487
{\an1}I'm not sure there's such a
thing as a good master, really.

129
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:53,854
{\an1}I mean, look at my master.

130
00:07:00,324 --> 00:07:02,660
The guy's a perv
and a scatterbrain.

131
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,730
And boy,
does he get carried away.

132
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:11,233
{\an1}Then again, when it comes to
being a ninja, he's way strong.

133
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:12,901
{\an1}And he's also dependable.

134
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:16,237
{\an1}And above all, kind.

135
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:19,072
{\an1}Well, I guess you just can't
judge a book by its cover.

136
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,773
{\an1}And if I could, I wouldn't
mind becoming a ninja like him

137
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,807
someday.

138
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:21,908
That's for sure.

139
00:07:26,877 --> 00:07:30,345
{\an1}- Seems to me that you like
your master a lot not, Naruto.

140
00:07:30,345 --> 00:07:32,648
{\an1}- Who'd like an old
pervert like him?

141
00:07:32,648 --> 00:07:36,151
{\an1}- Somehow, I must become
as strong as Utakata.

142
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:39,120
{\an1}Because if I can,
I can master the jutsu

143
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,822
{\an1}that grandfather left to me.

144
00:07:41,822 --> 00:07:44,990
{\an1}And then, perhaps I could even
restore the Tsuchigumo clan

145
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,925
to greatness.

146
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,294
- For someone so
young, you sure are

147
00:07:49,294 --> 00:07:51,161
{\an1}carrying a lot of
responsibility.

148
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:54,096
{\an1}Hey, so where do you
think that master of yours

149
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:55,264
{\an1}ran off to, anyway?

150
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:57,265
-Don't know.

151
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:59,433
{\an1}And for some reason,
every time I call him master,

152
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:02,902
{\an1}he gets very upset with me.

153
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:03,703
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sai, what
is it with all these leeches?

154
00:08:08,806 --> 00:08:12,909
{\an1}- You can stop with
the leeches now.

155
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,077
{\an1}- So, I guess the leeches
aren't big enough, then.

156
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:27,787
That's not it.

157
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:30,989
OK.

158
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:32,857
{\an1}-Enough is enough!

159
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:36,160
[screaming]

160
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,193
{\an1}-What are you doing, stupid Sai?

161
00:08:37,193 --> 00:08:38,894
Get a clue!

162
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,162
{\an1}My gestures couldn't
have been any clearer!

163
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:40,429
-Oh, boy.

164
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,269
{\an1}- At last, I'm back to
my vagabond lifestyle,

165
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:50,536
{\an1}traveling the world.

166
00:08:54,605 --> 00:08:56,373
She'll be OK.

167
00:08:56,373 --> 00:08:57,107
{\an1}That guy can protect her.

168
00:09:01,244 --> 00:09:04,613
{\an1}But that chakra... naw.

169
00:09:04,613 --> 00:09:05,613
It couldn't be.

170
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:37,135
{\an1}-You need immediate attention.

171
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:37,602
{\an1}We'll take you to our fort.

172
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,753
{\an1}- Looks like no one's
coming after me.

173
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:04,388
{\an1}And my wounds have healed.

174
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:06,756
{\an1}So I guess it's time to leave.

175
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:09,325
{\an1}- Please, you must accept
me as your student.

176
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:11,860
-That fight.

177
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,862
{\an1}After seeing you fight, I have
great respect for you, master.

178
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:16,096
-Master?

179
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:17,096
-That's right.

180
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:17,030
Master Utakata.

181
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:24,534
{\an1}-Don't ever call me that again.

182
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:25,502
-Huh?

183
00:10:25,502 --> 00:10:27,337
But...

184
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:28,204
{\an1}-Don't ever call me master!

185
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:40,980
-I...

186
00:10:47,718 --> 00:10:51,421
{\an1}- I have no intention
of taking on a student.

187
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:57,392
{\an1}-Utakata... you forget.

188
00:10:57,392 --> 00:10:57,959
{\an1}You owe me for my hospitality.

189
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,963
{\an1}Do you think it's OK to
just lounge around here

190
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,397
{\an1}and get free room and board?

191
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:07,298
Well, fine!

192
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:08,099
{\an1}What would you like for
your free meal today, sir?

193
00:11:11,435 --> 00:11:13,270
{\an1}-That was a cheap shot.

194
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,470
{\an1}I guess you're not afraid
to hit where it hurts.

195
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,871
- Well,
I had to get your attention.

196
00:11:16,871 --> 00:11:18,273
{\an1}Tonbee told me to
say that if you

197
00:11:18,273 --> 00:11:19,873
{\an1}refused to take me as a student.

198
00:11:19,873 --> 00:11:22,608
{\an1}-So he was in on this too, huh?

199
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:24,310
Hotaru,
the thing is you haven't had

200
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,577
{\an1}any kind of training at all.

201
00:11:25,577 --> 00:11:27,913
-I have.

202
00:11:27,913 --> 00:11:29,847
{\an1}I've received numerous
ninjutsu lessons from Tonbee.

203
00:11:29,847 --> 00:11:31,248
{\an1}- Then why don't you
go study with him?

204
00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:32,582
{\an1}-Because it's not enough.

205
00:11:32,582 --> 00:11:33,650
{\an1}That's why I'm asking you.

206
00:11:38,253 --> 00:11:40,188
-OK.

207
00:11:40,188 --> 00:11:41,621
{\an1}Let's see you walk on
that water over there.

208
00:11:41,621 --> 00:11:43,291
-Walk on water?

209
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:43,957
Fine.

210
00:11:43,957 --> 00:11:43,824
I will.

211
00:11:48,127 --> 00:11:50,795
[scream]

212
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:52,963
{\an1}UTAKATA (VOICEOVER): Good grief.

213
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,031
{\an1}At this rate, I'll be long gone
before she learns anything.

214
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:58,633
-Utakata!

215
00:11:58,633 --> 00:11:58,700
Utakata!

216
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:05,072
Look!

217
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:06,040
I did it!

218
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,173
See?

219
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,211
{\an1}- You... you've been
practicing all night long?

220
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:13,745
-Yes.

221
00:12:13,745 --> 00:12:14,846
{\an1}Now will you make
me your student?

222
00:12:14,846 --> 00:12:16,214
-No.

223
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:17,814
Uh,
that was just the first step.

224
00:12:17,814 --> 00:12:19,782
{\an1}The next is the jutsu.

225
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:20,916
{\an1}Water Style, Raging Waves.

226
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:29,889
-Amazing.

227
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:31,691
{\an1}- If you can't handle that
jutsu, you can't be my student.

228
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:34,393
-It's a deal.

229
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:35,559
{\an1}Water Style, Raging Waves.

230
00:12:40,364 --> 00:12:43,066
{\an1}Water Style, Raging Waves!

231
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:43,966
Nothing.

232
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:45,968
But why?

233
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:47,869
{\an1}- I'm afraid that
jutsu can only be

234
00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:50,003
{\an1}done if the wielder
possesses water chakra.

235
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:50,304
{\an1}Don't take it personally.

236
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,409
It's raining?

237
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:59,210
{\an1}-Utakata, I got it.

238
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,311
{\an1}-What are you doing?

239
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:01,712
{\an1}-Please, watch this.

240
00:13:01,712 --> 00:13:02,179
{\an1}Water Style, Raging Waves!

241
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:14,721
I did it.

242
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:16,489
{\an1}So you'll make me your
student now, right?

243
00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:21,325
{\an1}-Well... I... I can't.

244
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:22,994
Not yet.

245
00:13:22,994 --> 00:13:23,494
-Wait!

246
00:13:23,494 --> 00:13:23,593
Utakata!

247
00:13:29,131 --> 00:13:32,400
{\an1}- I figured you'd come to
see me sooner or later.

248
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,234
{\an1}-You're damn right.

249
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:36,669
{\an1}What were you thinking,
putting that kid up to that?

250
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:40,239
She's out of her
depth, and you know it.

251
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:42,640
{\an1}- That's why I want
to ask you a favor.

252
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,909
{\an1}Would you consider staying
here and acting as a guardian

253
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:48,011
{\an1}to keep Lady Hotaru safe?

254
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:49,711
-Amazing.

255
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:52,247
{\an1}You ask that is if
it's no trouble at all.

256
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:55,316
{\an1}- Lady Hotaru is a
child of destiny.

257
00:13:55,316 --> 00:13:57,884
{\an1}Judging by the way you
handled those men back there,

258
00:13:57,884 --> 00:14:00,454
{\an1}I can tell you're a man
of extraordinary skills.

259
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:04,122
{\an1}Above all, you're not greedy.

260
00:14:04,122 --> 00:14:07,525
As you can see,
I'm too old now to defend her.

261
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:09,426
{\an1}But if she becomes
your student, I

262
00:14:09,426 --> 00:14:11,961
{\an1}know her life will be
safe in your hands.

263
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:14,796
So please,
won't you do me this favor?

264
00:14:14,796 --> 00:14:16,697
{\an1}-I'm sorry, but I just can't.

265
00:14:16,697 --> 00:14:18,499
{\an1}As I'm sure you've
noticed, there

266
00:14:18,499 --> 00:14:21,634
{\an1}are men who are pursuing me.

267
00:14:21,634 --> 00:14:23,470
{\an1}No matter where I
go, death seems

268
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,437
{\an1}to follow close at my heels.

269
00:14:25,437 --> 00:14:28,605
{\an1}How could you even think
of leaving her with me?

270
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:28,840
{\an1}-You may be right.

271
00:14:33,076 --> 00:14:36,611
{\an1}- Besides, the bond
between master and student

272
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:37,679
{\an1}is nothing to put your faith in.

273
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:45,785
Master!

274
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:46,651
{\an1}What are you trying to do to me?

275
00:14:57,427 --> 00:14:58,427
Master?

276
00:14:58,427 --> 00:14:58,760
No!

277
00:15:10,136 --> 00:15:21,209
{\an1}[scream] I guess I dozed
off there for a bit.

278
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:21,143
Hm?

279
00:15:29,748 --> 00:15:31,551
{\an1}-What do you think?

280
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:33,318
{\an1}Could we really become
lords of our own domains?

281
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:34,986
{\an1}-Of course we could.

282
00:15:34,986 --> 00:15:36,387
{\an1}Isn't that right, Akaboshi?

283
00:15:36,387 --> 00:15:37,721
-That's right.

284
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:40,257
{\an1}So even if we just
sold that jutsu,

285
00:15:40,257 --> 00:15:42,124
{\an1}we'd still have enough money
to live the rest of our lives

286
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:44,527
in leisure.

287
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,226
-What?

288
00:15:45,226 --> 00:15:47,228
What's wrong?

289
00:15:47,228 --> 00:15:48,428
-Be on guard.

290
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:51,097
{\an1}There's somebody nearby.

291
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:54,400
-There!

292
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,234
What was that?

293
00:15:56,234 --> 00:15:58,369
-There!

294
00:15:58,369 --> 00:15:59,836
{\an1}-What is going on here?

295
00:15:59,836 --> 00:16:02,771
[laughter]

296
00:16:02,771 --> 00:16:06,408
{\an1}-Who the hell are you?

297
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:07,775
{\an1}- Doesn't look to me like
he's one of the Hidden Leaf's

298
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:09,644
reinforcements.

299
00:16:09,644 --> 00:16:11,579
{\an1}- Maybe this guy's
after the jutsu.

300
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,380
-Hm.

301
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,147
{\an1}Sinceyou know about
the forbidden jutsu,

302
00:16:15,147 --> 00:16:16,515
{\an1}that means you must
be the band of thieves

303
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:19,250
{\an1}who infiltrated the fort.

304
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,420
{\an1}Makes me wonder, is that
jutsu really so impressive?

305
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,622
'Cause if so,
maybe I do want it for myself.

306
00:16:26,622 --> 00:16:28,658
{\an1}- I suppose you think we're
just going to let you take it?

307
00:16:28,658 --> 00:16:30,192
{\an1}-So what do we do about him?

308
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:30,791
-Idiot.

309
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:30,958
Kill him.

310
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:38,130
After him!

311
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,366
{\an1}What is this slime?

312
00:16:49,804 --> 00:16:51,407
-I can't see!

313
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:52,373
-Spread out!

314
00:16:52,373 --> 00:16:52,840
{\an1}We'll surround him.

315
00:17:03,181 --> 00:17:05,316
{\an1}UTAKATA (VOICEOVER):
This chakra flow...

316
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,783
{\an1}their movements have
suddenly become much faster.

317
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:14,256
Barrier jutsu?

318
00:17:14,256 --> 00:17:16,190
-Let's go.

319
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:16,790
-Shin!

320
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,824
-Fu!

321
00:17:17,824 --> 00:17:18,792
-Jin!

322
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:18,892
-Rai!

323
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,402
{\an1}UTAKATA (VOICEOVER):
That's just great.

324
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:33,868
-It's over.

325
00:17:47,112 --> 00:17:48,980
{\an1}Just how long do you
intend to follow me?

326
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,147
{\an1}-What are you talking about?

327
00:17:51,147 --> 00:17:53,516
{\an1}You told us to stay till
we got through the forest.

328
00:17:53,516 --> 00:17:55,918
{\an1}-Yes, I did say that, but.

329
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:57,319
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
The thing is,

330
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,920
{\an1}the only thing between
the fort and the hideaway

331
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,689
is this forest.

332
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:03,624
{\an1}-You're still here?

333
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,524
{\an1}- Well, it looks like we'll
complete our assignment

334
00:18:05,524 --> 00:18:06,525
{\an1}without incident.

335
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:08,561
-Huh?

336
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:09,728
Whoa.

337
00:18:09,728 --> 00:18:10,228
{\an1}The village is right there.

338
00:18:35,345 --> 00:18:36,812
So weird.

339
00:18:36,812 --> 00:18:38,649
{\an1}There's no one here.

340
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:40,349
Hey!

341
00:18:40,349 --> 00:18:41,450
Hello?

342
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,884
Anyone here?

343
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:44,486
-Look sharp.

344
00:18:44,486 --> 00:18:45,085
-Got it.

345
00:18:49,888 --> 00:18:51,089
-Hey!

346
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,425
{\an1}Lady Hotaru's back!

347
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:54,825
{\an1}Doesn't anyone want to
come out and see her?

348
00:18:59,663 --> 00:18:59,996
Huh?

349
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:04,999
Hm.

350
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:06,933
{\an1}Wait, I know what we can do.

351
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:07,402
-Wait.

352
00:19:07,402 --> 00:19:08,736
Naruto!

353
00:19:08,736 --> 00:19:11,438
Oh, boy.

354
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:12,739
[ringing]

355
00:19:12,739 --> 00:19:14,039
-Emergency!

356
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,708
A big fire!

357
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,442
Emergency!

358
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:20,344
[ringing]

359
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:28,949
-Ah-ha!

360
00:19:28,949 --> 00:19:30,950
{\an1}So you were here!

361
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,652
{\an1}-What is she doing here?

362
00:19:32,652 --> 00:19:35,521
{\an1}-I don't know about this.

363
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:41,124
[whispering]

364
00:19:41,124 --> 00:19:43,794
{\an1}- Sorry if I scared everyone,
but since all you guys

365
00:19:43,794 --> 00:19:46,562
{\an1}were hiding away, I had to
do something pretty drastic

366
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:48,330
{\an1}to get you to come out and
welcome Lady Hotaru back

367
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,497
to the village.

368
00:19:49,497 --> 00:19:51,733
{\an1}Sorry about that.

369
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,833
[whispering]

370
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:54,834
-What?

371
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:56,169
{\an1}What's the problem?

372
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:56,469
-Ah.

373
00:19:56,469 --> 00:19:58,970
Hotaru.

374
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,272
HOTARU: Uncle.

375
00:20:00,272 --> 00:20:02,673
- Thank you for
bringing her here.

376
00:20:02,673 --> 00:20:04,974
{\an1}I'm the one responsible for
the welfare of this village.

377
00:20:04,974 --> 00:20:06,942
Lord En no Gyoja
instructed me on what

378
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:08,944
to do if Hotaru
were to come here.

379
00:20:08,944 --> 00:20:10,045
{\an1}Your job is done.

380
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:11,413
{\an1}You can leave the rest to us.

381
00:20:11,413 --> 00:20:12,613
-Very well.

382
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:13,914
{\an1}Then we'll be on our way.

383
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:15,650
{\an1}-Stay a moment, if you would.

384
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,518
{\an1}We haven't had a chance
to thank you properly.

385
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:20,119
{\an1}YAMATO: We appreciate
your thoughtfulness,

386
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,920
{\an1}but we left the teammate at Mt.

387
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,621
{\an1}Katsuragi, and would
like to get back to her.

388
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:25,122
-Very well.

389
00:20:25,122 --> 00:20:26,657
{\an1}Although that is unfortunate.

390
00:20:26,657 --> 00:20:27,825
-Come on.

391
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:29,192
{\an1}Let's not keep Sakura waiting.

392
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:29,692
-Oh.

393
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:30,026
OK.

394
00:20:36,263 --> 00:20:36,197
-Naruto?

395
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:40,567
-I...

396
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:46,204
-You'll be fine.

397
00:20:50,507 --> 00:20:50,973
-Thank you.

398
00:21:00,214 --> 00:21:02,315
{\an1}-What's the matter, Naruto?

399
00:21:02,315 --> 00:21:04,784
- Sorry, Captain
Yamato, but I think

400
00:21:04,784 --> 00:21:06,985
you better go on
ahead without me.

401
00:21:06,985 --> 00:21:08,553
{\an1}'Cause I've gotta go
back to that village.

402
00:21:08,553 --> 00:21:10,154
-Go back?

403
00:21:10,154 --> 00:21:12,555
{\an1}- Something about
that place bugs me.

404
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:14,124
{\an1}I can't stop thinking
about the way

405
00:21:14,124 --> 00:21:16,725
{\an1}those villagers looked at her.

406
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:17,626
-Naruto!

407
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:19,862
Wait!

408
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:20,661
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I can't
leave her there alone.

409
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:29,033
[theme music]

410
00:22:56,428 --> 00:22:57,596
{\an1}NARUTO: What do you
mean Hotaru is gone?

411
00:22:57,596 --> 00:22:58,963
{\an1}Where did she go?

412
00:22:58,963 --> 00:22:59,630
YAMATO: Naruto.

413
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,032
Don't.

414
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:03,066
{\an1}NARUTO: But something might have
happened to one of their own.

415
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:05,234
{\an1}Why aren't they looking for her?

416
00:23:05,234 --> 00:23:07,603
{\an1}YAMATO: There's no
point in arguing.

417
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:09,404
{\an1}In any case, finding her
is our top priority now.

418
00:23:09,404 --> 00:23:11,071
Sai.

419
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:12,439
SAI: Understood.

420
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:15,609
{\an1}I'll scout the area right away.

421
00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:17,844
{\an1}NARUTO: Next time
on Naruto Shippuden,

422
00:23:17,844 --> 00:23:20,612
{\an1}The Successor's Wish.

423
00:23:20,612 --> 00:23:22,112
Just hold on.

424
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,048
We'll find you.
