{\an1}(GENGO) This flower is the
result of a selective breeding
program.

136
00:11:23,087 --> 00:11:25,554
{\an1}(GENGO) You've seen it here and
there in the wild, haven't you?

137
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,754
{\an1}But all of it was just for
nothing...

138
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:30,055
(Gasp)

139
00:11:31,488 --> 00:11:33,388
{\an1}(GENGO) This flower wilts the
moment it's taken out of this
village,

140
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:36,722
{\an1}(GENGO) due to our unique
environment.

141
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:39,221
{\an1}(GENGO) Why did you choose to
become a shinobi?

142
00:11:39,922 --> 00:11:42,056
{\an1}(GENGO) To file papers for the
rest of your life?

143
00:11:42,922 --> 00:11:43,655
Who knows?

144
00:11:44,022 --> 00:11:44,822
Heh.

145
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,822
{\an1}Most likely, that isn't the
case.

146
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:52,221
{\an1}After all, you still train every
day in order to hone your
skills.

147
00:11:52,255 --> 00:11:56,221
{\an1}(GENGO) You use those skills to
defeat the enemy and protect
what is precious.

148
00:11:56,755 --> 00:11:59,322
{\an1}(GENGO) That's the way a shinobi
should live.

149
00:11:59,355 --> 00:12:02,722
{\an1}(GENGO) That's the way your
father, lived. And your mentor,
too.

150
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,622
(Grunt)

151
00:12:06,022 --> 00:12:07,755
{\an1}And just how would you know
that, huh?!

152
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:12,622
{\an1}In all probability, you're
hoping that you'll be able to
measure up to them both someday.

153
00:12:13,022 --> 00:12:16,221
{\an1}And yet in a world where peace
has become the norm,

154
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,088
{\an1}is there really a way for you to
accomplish that?

155
00:12:19,423 --> 00:12:23,890
{\an1}(GENGO) It's because of war that
shinobi abilities were able to
develop so remarkably.

156
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,923
{\an1}(GENGO) If instead there'd been
continual peace,

157
00:12:26,957 --> 00:12:30,690
{\an1}(GENGO) you never would've spent
all those priceless moments with
your friends.

158
00:12:30,723 --> 00:12:32,756
{\an1}(GENGO) Can you really say that
I'm wrong?

159
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,356
(Gasp)

160
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:43,057
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) If that's the price
for peace,... then I'll gladly
throw down my weapons.

161
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:45,890
{\an1}You're not really speaking from
the heart.

162
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:50,389
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) <i>You can feel your</i>
<i>own abilities weakening, can't</i>
<i>you?</i>

163
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:56,057
(Gasp)

164
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,089
{\an1}Now, Shikamaru...

165
00:12:58,523 --> 00:12:59,590
(Grunt)

166
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:00,856
{\an1}Get away from me!

167
00:13:01,423 --> 00:13:02,389
{\an1}You two, stand down!

168
00:13:03,556 --> 00:13:04,990
{\an1}(labored breathing)

169
00:13:05,023 --> 00:13:09,058
{\an1}(GENGO) Don't be frightened,
Shikamaru... Just... lower your
weapon...

170
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:14,557
(SHIKAMARU)
(heavy breathing)

171
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:20,390
{\an1}(GENGO) Yes, that's it...
First, why don't you just try to
calm down? Take a deep breath.

172
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:23,390
Do you like it?

173
00:13:24,457 --> 00:13:26,791
{\an1}The scent of my precious flowers
is nice, isn't it?

174
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,058
(Gasp)

175
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:29,791
Come on now...

176
00:13:30,657 --> 00:13:32,891
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) I see... so, that's
it...

177
00:13:34,524 --> 00:13:34,991
(Grunt)

178
00:13:39,324 --> 00:13:43,257
{\an1}Certain flowers produce scents
that have the ability to stir up
people's memories.

179
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:48,557
{\an1}That's what you've been using to
brainwash people. That's "the
will" you've been giving them!

180
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:51,657
{\an1}Unfortunately, that discovery
won't get you anywhere.

181
00:13:52,257 --> 00:13:53,892
{\an1}(GENGO) You can't defy me.

182
00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:58,892
{\an1}Where are my comrades? Where are
Ro and Soku?! Bring them to me
now!

183
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:01,291
{\an1}(RO) We're right here.

184
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:02,291
(Gasp)

185
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:04,625
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) Huh! You two?!

186
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:06,124
(SHIKAMARU)
(Gasp)

187
00:14:07,224 --> 00:14:09,558
{\an1}(SOKU) Like, Lord Gengo has
given us a new will...

188
00:14:22,758 --> 00:14:25,391
{\an1}(GUARD) Find him! Don't let him
escape the castle!

189
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:36,558
{\an1}Please, Shikamaru, it's useless
to try to hide.

190
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:40,758
{\an1}(heavy breathing)

191
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,259
(Grunt)

192
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:48,793
{\an1}Oh, man... My shoulder is still
numb... Nice shot, Soku...

193
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:50,559
Huh?

194
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:53,292
{\an1}I can't use my Shadows with
these clouds.

195
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:57,259
{\an1}My rook and bishop
advantage is gone, too. Not
good...

196
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:01,125
Hmmm...

197
00:15:02,326 --> 00:15:04,726
{\an1}The "Climbing Silver" move,
right off the bat like that?

198
00:15:05,392 --> 00:15:10,726
{\an1}To penetrate the enemy's line
sometimes you have to be willing
to risk a bold move.

199
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:16,326
{\an1}<i>If I escape now, the risk for</i>
<i>the Hidden Leaf will increase.</i>

200
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:21,225
{\an1}<i>That's what you told me</i>
<i>back then. So, I guess</i>
<i>that time has come for me...</i>

201
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,727
{\an1}<i>Just stay calm. There's still a</i>
<i>chance that an opportunity will</i>
<i>appear.</i>

202
00:15:32,927 --> 00:15:36,226
{\an1}<i>(ASUMA) You know what?  I'd say</i>
<i>you were most like the knight.</i>

203
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,894
{\an1}Climbing Silver to break through
enemy lines... or maybe just a
knight that jumps far... Hmm?

204
00:15:49,027 --> 00:15:50,061
Hmm...

205
00:15:51,794 --> 00:15:55,727
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) I guess that I have
no choice but to jump back into
the den of the king...

206
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,627
{\an1}(RO) Lord Gengo, are you sure
it's all right to leave the
search for Shikamaru to Sai?

207
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:09,894
{\an1}(SOKU) Like, it'll be bad if he
gets out of the castle.

208
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,226
{\an7}(GENGO) Oh don't worry.

209
00:16:13,061 --> 00:16:17,728
{\an1}(GENGO) If he's cornered, he's
the type to throw himself into
an even more difficult situation

210
00:16:17,761 --> 00:16:20,928
{\an1}(GENGO) to escape. Isn't that
right, Shikamaru?

211
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:21,728
(Gasp)

212
00:16:24,962 --> 00:16:27,428
{\an1}So, you knew I was here, huh? ú
That's no fun.

213
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:32,062
{\an1}I was certain that you'd never
leave this lighter behind.

214
00:16:33,062 --> 00:16:36,062
{\an1}(SOKU) Like, you came back just
for that? Boy, you're really
something!

215
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,227
{\an1}Surrender and be captured!

216
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:42,261
(Grunt)

217
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:43,062
(Gasp)

218
00:16:44,428 --> 00:16:45,227
(Gasp)

219
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:49,895
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) Well if the floor
won't work, then there's always
the ceiling.

220
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:54,227
(Gasp)

221
00:16:54,428 --> 00:16:55,227

222
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:56,227

00:16:58,161 --> 00:16:59,062
(Gasp)

224
00:16:59,595 --> 00:17:01,328
(RO) Can't move!

225
00:17:01,361 --> 00:17:01,962
All right...

226
00:17:02,795 --> 00:17:04,796
{\an1}(Gasp) Lord Shikamaru,
release me!

227
00:17:05,128 --> 00:17:08,829
{\an1}To break a genjutsu, the theory
is to bring down the one who
cast it.

228
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:11,063
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) What do you say,
Gengo?

229
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:14,829
{\an1}Impossible. There's nobody who's
able to resist my words.

230
00:17:16,128 --> 00:17:19,195
{\an1}Sorry... but you're gonna have
to be my shield for a while, Ro.

231
00:17:19,596 --> 00:17:21,829
{\an1}(GENGO) Fire! Don't worry about
hitting Ro!

232
00:17:21,862 --> 00:17:24,562
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) Yeah, go ahead. Just
make sure you aim straight.

233
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:28,162
(Grunt)

234
00:17:32,629 --> 00:17:35,562
{\an1}Stop, Shikamaru! You can't
resist my voice!

235
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:37,696
{\an1}Don't tell me that you?!

236
00:17:39,495 --> 00:17:43,063
{\an1}(GENGO) You purposely let Soku
hit you in the ears in order to
dull your sense of hearing?!

237
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:46,562
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) Alright this is the
knight's jump!

238
00:17:48,629 --> 00:17:49,896
Huh!

239
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,396
(Gasp)

240
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:53,330
Uhh!

241
00:17:55,697 --> 00:17:58,663
{\an1}You were so close, Shikamaru. So
very close!!

242
00:17:59,597 --> 00:18:02,797
{\an1}(SAI) Please stay back, Lord
Gengo. Just leave this to me.

243
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,229
Nicely done!

244
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,797
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) Gengo!

245

00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:15,897
Damn it!

250
00:18:28,263 --> 00:18:29,730
(sigh)

251
00:18:30,763 --> 00:18:34,229
{\an1}(SHIKAKU) Damn it. Girls just
keep beating you up...

252
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,397
{\an1}(SHIKAKU) Weren't you going to
become a stronger leader for the
sake of your friends??

253
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,397
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) Dad... I... I just
don't think I'm cut out to be a
Shinobi.

254
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,998
{\an1}(disappointed sigh)

255
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:57,564
{\an1}(GENGO) Is he dead?

256
00:18:58,097 --> 00:18:59,731
{\an1}(SOKU) I didn't, like, kill him
yet.

257
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,798
{\an1}In the end, he had no chance
against the three of us.

258
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:04,464
{\an1}(SAI) How pitiful...

259
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:11,397
{\an1}<i>(SHIKAMARU) I'm at my physical</i>

<i>Man, this is such a drag...</i>

261
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:19,065
Huh?

00:19:20,197 --> 00:19:21,798
{\an1}Hey, Shikamaru. ú You okay?

263
00:19:22,197 --> 00:19:23,931
{\an1}Don't you dare go dying on us

{\an1}Oh... ú Okay, I'm still

269
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:35,899
(TEMARI) Shikamaru!

00:19:36,432 --> 00:19:37,732
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) T-Temari?!

271
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:42,665
{\an1}I expected more out of you!
Why're you just sitting there,

00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:43,432
Shikamaru!

273
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:45,165
{\an1}Take it easy, Temari!

274
00:19:45,198 --> 00:19:47,165
{\an1}Yeah, or else he really could
die...

275
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:48,165
{\an1}Oh, just shut up!

276
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,999

00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,066
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) I'm sorry, Temari.

278
00:19:54,332 --> 00:19:55,066
Huh?

279
00:19:56,131 --> 00:19:58,565
{\an1}(Chuckle) Thanks to you, I've
come to my senses.

280
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:00,066
{\an1}Shikamaru...?!

281
00:20:01,865 --> 00:20:06,066
{\an1}Sorry, but can you take over for
me here? I have one more guy
that I still need to take down.

282
00:20:06,699 --> 00:20:07,565
You mean Gengo?!

283
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:10,066
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) Huh? How'd you
know that?!

284
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:14,566
{\an1}Lord Hokage told me everything.
And I had a hell of a time
getting it out of him, too...

285
00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:18,399
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) I don't want to know
what you did. I don't even want
to imagine it!

286
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:22,566
(Grunt)

287
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:25,666
{\an1}Shikamaru, is it okay if we
crush these guys?

288
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:28,733
{\an1}They're brainwashed, but they're
our comrades, so be gentle ok.

289
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:31,067
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) Oh and could you
wake them up, too!

290
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,666
{\an1}Like, shut your mouth.

291
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:33,933
Hold on!

292
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,067
Huh?

293
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:36,399
{\an1}(TEMARI) You're forgetting
something.

294
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:37,099
Uh!

295
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,033
(Gasp)

296
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:41,566
{\an1}(TEMARI) He probably knows
you're coming and has laid traps
for you.

297
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,333
{\an1}I hope you can win
as banged up as you are.

298
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:48,067
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) I'm no sacrificial
pawn.

299
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:51,900
(Grunt)

300
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,399
Oh!

301
00:20:58,967 --> 00:20:59,800
{\an1}Well, all right then!

302
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,300
(chuckle)

303
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,734
{\an1}Okay... it's time for
our final moves...

304
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,133
Gengo!

305
00:21:20,034 --> 00:21:23,968
{\an1}TO BE CONTINUED...

306
00:22:56,769 --> 00:22:59,070
{\an1}(GENGO) The Leaf is still that
important to you?

307
00:22:59,436 --> 00:23:00,636
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) Damn right it is!

308
00:23:01,003 --> 00:23:03,135
{\an1}(GENGO) Then I'll let you in on
a little secret...

309
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:06,036
{\an1}(GENGO) What would you think if
I told you I've sent my
followers,

310
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,235
{\an1}(GENGO) with the will I bestowed
upon them, into all the
Hidden Villages?

311
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:11,235
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) What's that?!

312
00:23:12,436 --> 00:23:14,736
{\an1}(SHIKAMARU) Next time on Naruto
Shippuden:

313
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:20,070
{\an1}"Shikamaru's Story, A Cloud
Drifting in the Silent Dark,
Part 5: Dawn."

314
00:23:20,102 --> 00:23:22,736
{\an1}(GENGO) And you don't have the
means to stop it!
