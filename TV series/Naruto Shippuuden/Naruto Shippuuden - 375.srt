1
00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:18,713
Wind Style:
Massive Rasen Shuriken!

2
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:23,386
Inferno Style:
Susano'o Flame Control!

3
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:31,594
No.

4
00:00:31,962 --> 00:00:33,365
{\an1}That's not what I meant...

5
00:00:35,934 --> 00:00:38,636
{\an1}What I meant was, that
only my Wind can assist

6
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,440
{\an1}and magnify his Fire.

7
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:46,846
[roaring]

8
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:47,914
[chuckle]

9
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:57,493
{\an1}Now just burn up.

10
00:01:00,763 --> 00:01:02,432
{\an1}You heard it, didn't you?

11
00:01:02,465 --> 00:01:04,167
{\an1}What Sasuke said earlier?

12
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:07,471
{\an1}What do you think his
true intentions are?

13
00:01:13,044 --> 00:01:15,112
[growling]

14
00:01:16,114 --> 00:01:17,681
No idea.

15
00:01:35,236 --> 00:01:37,572
{\an1}Though still incomplete, Ten
Tails has been revived and

16
00:01:37,605 --> 00:01:39,975
is battling the
Allied Forces.

17
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:42,878
{\an1}It's become quite a
complex situation.

18
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,448
It's that bad?

19
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:49,753
{\an1}In that case, we all
ought to hurry, too!

20
00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:51,956
{\an1}I can carry all of
you with my sand.

21
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,991
Please,
preserve your chakra.

22
00:01:54,325 --> 00:01:56,361
But we all came
in mid-story!

23
00:01:56,395 --> 00:01:58,063
{\an1}I want more details!

24
00:01:58,097 --> 00:02:00,467
{\an1}Why don't we hear
about it on the way?

25
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,034
{\an1}Yes, let's just go!

26
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:03,436
{\an1}To the battlefield!

27
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,669
[roaring]

28
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:03,977
{\an1}So you don't know.

29
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,715
And yet you keep
working with Sasuke.

30
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:07,848
Why's that?

31
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:12,487
{\an1}The answer's simple,
it's because I exist

32
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,055
to protect him.

33
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,294
Hey, Sasuke!

34
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:19,862
{\an1}There are still other
Tailed Beasts inside

35
00:04:19,895 --> 00:04:21,398
{\an1}that gigantic one!

36
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:24,334
{\an1}So douse those Black
Flames when it's weakened!

37
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:26,371
{\an1}Then Kurama and I
will pull them out!

38
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:27,639
No, I won't.

39
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:29,974
They all burn.

40
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:31,309
Listen!

41
00:04:31,342 --> 00:04:32,645
{\an1}Don't you understand?!

42
00:04:32,678 --> 00:04:35,247
{\an1}If we don't save them now,
we're going to have a lot of

43
00:04:35,281 --> 00:04:36,650
{\an1}trouble later on!

44
00:04:38,217 --> 00:04:40,920
{\an1}I'm going to put an end to
this failing system that's

45
00:04:40,954 --> 00:04:42,522
{\an1}currently in place!

46
00:04:46,227 --> 00:04:47,962
{\an1}And then a new...

47
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:49,330
[gasp]

48
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:03,012
{\an1}It detached the piece of
itself that was on fire!

49
00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:04,815
[angry roars]

50
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:12,558
Sakura...

51
00:05:13,258 --> 00:05:15,194
{\an1}May I ask you something?

52
00:05:17,897 --> 00:05:21,301
{\an1}I don't know him well, so I
can see it impartially...

53
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:25,773
{\an1}Sasuke can't be trusted or
considered a true comrade.

54
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,942
What are your
actual feelings on

55
00:05:27,975 --> 00:05:29,511
{\an1}the matter, Sakura?

56
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:33,449
Don't worry.

57
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:36,051
{\an1}It's just that Sasuke
has come back to us again!

58
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,488
{\an1}That fact makes me
sincerely happy.

59
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:40,857
{\an1}And I do fully believe him.

60
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,996
Your words may
not be lies...

61
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,398
But...

62
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:52,538
{\an1}I can already tell
that your smile is fake.

63
00:05:58,244 --> 00:06:00,079
{\an1}What's up, Shikamaru?

64
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:03,550
It's nothing.

65
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:29,947
Obito...

66
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:31,383
{\an1}Enough of these tricks.

67
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:34,621
I'm over it now.

68
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,392
{\an1}No more genjutsu.

69
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:44,800
{\an1}It looks to me like
I can't find anything

70
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,535
{\an1}that will change you.

71
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:54,210
{\an1}Right now, all I can
give you is just death.

72
00:06:58,014 --> 00:07:00,784
{\an1}Then I shall do the same.

73
00:07:02,352 --> 00:07:03,621
Now...

74
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:10,863
{\an1}Shinobi Hand-to-Hand Combat.

75
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,299
Well now that
you're ready...

76
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:15,402
Begin!

77
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,080
{\an1}Lemme borrow this.

78
00:08:57,055 --> 00:08:59,591
{\an1}Fire Style Fireball Jutsu!

79
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:05,229
{\an1}Earth Style Mud Wall!

80
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:40,805
{\an1}This is the real one!

81
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:03,331
{\an1}Hand-to-hand combat's over.

82
00:10:03,364 --> 00:10:04,733
{\an1}The win goes to Kakashi.

83
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:07,336
{\an1}Okay, make the Unison Sign.

84
00:10:19,985 --> 00:10:22,754
{\an1}Obito, your once-strong
will is still alive today

85
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,489
{\an1}right next to me!

86
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,659
{\an1}The only thing the
current me can do is

87
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,928
{\an1}protect the current Naruto!

88
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,299
You...

89
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:38,673
{\an1}No, everyone, actually
shall eventually just

90
00:10:38,707 --> 00:10:40,775
end up like me.

91
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,015
{\an1}Sasuke's a Rogue Shinobi.

92
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:48,284
{\an1}Standard operating
procedure is to erase him.

93
00:10:48,317 --> 00:10:51,922
{\an1}You're going back to the
Leaf if I have to drag you!

94
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:54,992
{\an1}But I'm not worthy of
being Hokage if I can't

95
00:10:55,026 --> 00:10:56,761
{\an1}even save a friend.

96
00:10:57,095 --> 00:11:00,999
{\an1}And I am going to become the
greatest Hokage of them all!

97
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:03,102
I'll never let
my comrades die!

98
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:05,038
{\an1}No matter what happens!

99
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:07,239
{\an1}Naruto, you never waver.

100
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:12,545
{\an1}You're stronger than me
and have many things

101
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,482
{\an1}that are solely yours.

102
00:11:15,783 --> 00:11:18,019
This is all I
can do right now.

103
00:11:19,187 --> 00:11:20,422
And that is...

104
00:11:22,324 --> 00:11:24,093
{\an1}...to protect this world.

105
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:26,329
My comrades...

106
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:29,900
...and the Obito
of the past...

107
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:32,469
...by killing...

108
00:11:37,876 --> 00:11:39,811
{\an1}...the current Obito!

109
00:12:28,735 --> 00:12:31,505
{\an1}It's over, Obito.

110
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,909
[laughter]

111
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,712
[coughing]

112
00:12:41,183 --> 00:12:46,223
{\an1}Very well, I'll let
you win this battle.

113
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:51,929
However I am not
conceding the war!

114
00:13:12,686 --> 00:13:14,421
{\an1}I thought I told you
I have no intention

115
00:13:14,455 --> 00:13:16,491
{\an1}of fighting a clone.

116
00:13:16,524 --> 00:13:18,127
{\an1}They give no resistance.

117
00:13:18,995 --> 00:13:21,396
{\an1}I respect the effort,
but it's pointless.

118
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:22,965
{\an1}You're concentrating
too much power

119
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:24,734
{\an1}in your real body.

120
00:13:27,704 --> 00:13:31,376
{\an1}So Madara, you too, were
holding back something.

121
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,514
Huh?

122
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,384
What is that?

123
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:48,930
{\an1}Looks like that is of
no use to me anymore.

124
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:52,367
{\an1}I had wanted to fight
Hashirama before I

125
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:54,336
{\an1}became a Jinchuriki.

126
00:13:55,404 --> 00:13:57,139
{\an1}I guess I have no choice.

127
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:06,817
M- My body!

128
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:10,821
{\an1}It's time to make him bring
me back with Rinne Rebirth!

129
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:41,157
[screaming]

130
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,396
That's--!

131
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,504
Obito...

132
00:14:53,537 --> 00:14:55,640
{\an1}Do you finally realize
that you are merely a

133
00:14:55,674 --> 00:14:58,643
{\an1}backup that I had
cultivated for my rebirth?

134
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,081
{\an1}Are you saying that
you saved me, Gramps?

135
00:15:02,115 --> 00:15:02,949
[chuckle]

136
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:04,684
Well, thank you.

137
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:07,389
{\an1}It's too early to
thank me just yet.

138
00:15:07,422 --> 00:15:09,656
{\an1}And besides, I still
intend to have you

139
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,760
{\an1}repay your debt to me.

140
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,164
{\an1}It's time to have you
repay your debt right now.

141
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:17,833
[screaming]

142
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:20,936
{\an1}He's being controlled
by Madara's chakra!

143
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,578
{\an1}Is that the Six Paths'
Forbidden Rinne

144
00:15:28,612 --> 00:15:29,814
Rebirth Jutsu?!

145
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:32,050
Madara!

146
00:15:32,084 --> 00:15:34,720
{\an1}He must not be allowed
to fully return to life!

147
00:15:35,921 --> 00:15:36,955
Lads!

148
00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:38,124
{\an1}You're all closer!

149
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:41,529
{\an1}Go stop the jutsu of the one
atop Ten Tails right now!

150
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:43,730
Okay!

151
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:45,466
Got- Sasuke!

152
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:51,206
I see...

153
00:15:52,441 --> 00:15:54,377
So that's the
way it is, huh?

154
00:16:02,386 --> 00:16:03,754
{\an1}Is this the maximum
number I can muster

155
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:05,523
{\an1}inside this barrier?

156
00:16:06,391 --> 00:16:07,459
Tobirama!

157
00:16:07,492 --> 00:16:08,526
Right!

158
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,261
{\an1}Shadow Clone Jutsu!

159
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:14,767
I can only make
two of them?!

160
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:16,869
This is so
embarrassing.

161
00:16:17,203 --> 00:16:19,339
{\an1}We'll just have to make
do with what we have!

162
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:23,411
{\an1}Predicting that those after
Obito won't be in time,

163
00:16:23,444 --> 00:16:25,712
they're going to
attack me instead.

164
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:28,883
{\an1}But they must realize
that clones aren't

165
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,019
{\an1}enough to stop me.

166
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,068
Aoda!

167
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:44,935
That's enough!

168
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:46,070
Get going!

169
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:48,106
{\an1}Yes, Lord Sasuke!

170
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,184
[chuckle]

171
00:17:49,978 --> 00:17:52,081
{\an1}You won't always be
like this either, right?

172
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,651
Don't give up.

173
00:17:57,254 --> 00:17:58,322
Rin...

174
00:17:58,689 --> 00:18:00,625
...you love her,
don't you?

175
00:18:03,428 --> 00:18:05,697
We're both gonna
become Hokage.

176
00:18:09,401 --> 00:18:10,970
Right, Obito?

177
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:21,482
Sensei...

178
00:18:23,918 --> 00:18:25,286
Obito?!

179
00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:34,497
So...

180
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,467
That was you?!

181
00:18:42,106 --> 00:18:43,341
[gasps]

182
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:50,915
Well?

183
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,851
Which one?

184
00:18:54,153 --> 00:18:55,222
[chuckle]

185
00:18:55,255 --> 00:18:56,856
What a failure!

186
00:18:56,889 --> 00:18:58,959
But oh well!

187
00:18:59,993 --> 00:19:01,229
{\an1}Did they succeed?!

188
00:19:01,262 --> 00:19:02,330
All right!

189
00:19:02,363 --> 00:19:03,965
{\an1}That's Lord Fourth Hokage!

190
00:19:07,035 --> 00:19:09,171
He teleported a
Shadow Clone.

191
00:19:09,204 --> 00:19:11,340
Had he marked
the enemy already?

192
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:21,385
A Flying Raijin
marking never disappears.

193
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:25,157
{\an1}I didn't teach you
that, did I, Obito?

194
00:19:30,797 --> 00:19:33,032
{\an1}If you were alive, I
would have wanted you

195
00:19:33,066 --> 00:19:34,967
{\an1}to become Hokage.

196
00:19:35,703 --> 00:19:37,171
So why did you-?

197
00:19:39,306 --> 00:19:40,742
{\an1}That was anticlimactic...

198
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:44,579
{\an1}So now all that's left to do
is seal the un-reborn Madara

199
00:19:44,612 --> 00:19:47,248
{\an1}and this war will be over.

200
00:19:48,818 --> 00:19:50,619
{\an1}Well, plus this giant thing.

201
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:54,358
{\an1}What exactly makes
you think that the war

202
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:57,795
is over, my
fellow traitor?

203
00:19:59,062 --> 00:20:00,531
[gasps]

204
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,121
No!

205
00:20:20,154 --> 00:20:21,021
Dad!

206
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:22,156
Sasuke!

207
00:20:25,828 --> 00:20:27,195
Go, Gamakichi!

208
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:28,598
All right!

209
00:20:34,438 --> 00:20:36,607
{\an1}What is going on?!

210
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:39,344
{\an1}Is the Ten Tails changing
form again or something?

211
00:20:40,812 --> 00:20:42,782
No, that's not
what's happening!

212
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,752
Obito repelled
Madara's manipulation

213
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:50,089
{\an1}and he's been weaving the
signs necessary to do this

214
00:20:50,122 --> 00:20:51,892
{\an1}right from the beginning!

215
00:21:03,672 --> 00:21:04,706
He's become...

216
00:21:15,084 --> 00:21:17,621
{\an1}Ten Tails' Jinchuriki!

217
00:22:55,904 --> 00:22:58,205
{\an1}<i>Oh, man, I really want</i>
<i>to find out what happens!</i>

218
00:22:58,239 --> 00:23:00,676
{\an1}<i>But the next episode</i>
<i>will be a little breather.</i>

219
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:02,745
{\an1}<i>It's an "Extra Edition!"</i>

220
00:23:03,178 --> 00:23:05,415
{\an1}<i>Pain and Itachi are</i>
<i>gonna appear again!</i>

221
00:23:05,448 --> 00:23:08,284
{\an1}<i>What's more, Deidara and</i>
<i>Pervy Sage show up and</i>

222
00:23:08,318 --> 00:23:10,554
{\an1}<i>cause a big ruckus in</i>
<i>the Leaf Village!</i>

223
00:23:11,087 --> 00:23:13,424
<i>What kind of a</i>
<i>story is this, anyway?!</i>

224
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:17,262
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Extra Edition:</i>

225
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:20,032
<i>The Directive to</i>
<i>Take the Nine Tails!"</i>

226
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,568
<i>Just what in the</i>
<i>world are you?!</i>
