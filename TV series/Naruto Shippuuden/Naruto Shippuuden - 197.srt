1
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:26,575
{\an1}<i>I'm certain.</i>

2
00:00:27,676 --> 00:00:30,678
{\an1}It's Orochimaru's.
An old hideout.

3
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:35,282
{\an1}That's just like Kabuto
to take advantage of an
old asset.

4
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,051
Wait. They're with us.

5
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:41,786
{\an1}Captain Mitarashi.

6
00:00:42,587 --> 00:00:44,623
I've come with an order
from the Village.

7
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:49,225
{\an1}Sai will return home.
And you are to continue
the mission to track Kabuto.

8
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:51,728
{\an1}<i>We are here to assist</i>
<i>you with that.</i>

9
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:56,398
{\an5}You can give me
information, too;
Yamato rushed back in
the middle of a mission.

10
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,532
So what's
happened?

11
00:00:57,832 --> 00:01:01,369
The Akatsuki mounted
an attack on the
Hidden Leaf Village.

12
00:01:01,835 --> 00:01:05,838
{\an5}It's destroyed,
and many injured.
And Lady Tsunade
is in a coma.

13
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:07,473
{\an1}What did you say?!

14
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,543
And now, Lord Danzo has
taken over as Hokage.

15
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,978
How'd such a thing
happen so quickly?

16
00:01:15,345 --> 00:01:18,015
{\an1}I can give you all the
details later on, Captain.

17
00:01:18,215 --> 00:01:19,616
Well, Sai?

18
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:21,350
{\an1}Right.

19
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:27,422
{\an7}<i>Sai and I spent a</i>
<i>lot of time together</i>
<i>on this mission.</i>

20
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:29,790
{\an7}<i>But he remained</i>
<i>distant to the end.</i>

21
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:33,761
{\an7}<i>Lord Danzo...</i>
<i>is now Hokage?</i>

22
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:38,096
{\an1}The essence of a ninja
is to operate in secret.

23
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,467
{\an1}But there are times when a
man who moves in the shadows
must step out into the light.

24
00:01:44,402 --> 00:01:47,504
{\an1}<i>And for me, that time is now.</i>

25
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:51,940
{\an1}<i>I hope that I can</i>
<i>count on your</i>
<i>continued loyalty.</i>

26
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:54,108
[all]
Yes, sir!

27
00:03:39,657 --> 00:03:43,159
{\an1}The Sixth Hokage Danzo

28
00:03:44,862 --> 00:03:46,396
<i>[sigh]</i>

29
00:03:46,429 --> 00:03:47,996
What to do...

30
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,664
What now?!

31
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:55,403
{\an4}It's just, what if there
are a ton of really
pretty girls in the
Hidden Leaf Village?

32
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,904
{\an1}And what if all those
beautiful women
totally come after me?

33
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,473
{\an1}I was trying to figure
out what I'd do.

34
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:07,111
{\an4}Oh, yeah, I see!
Why not just date all
of them since you're
such a ladies man?

35
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:08,679
{\an1}Left and right,
up and down!

36
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:10,580
Yeah, but,

37
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:12,649
{\an1}When it's time to leave
the Hidden Leaf,

38
00:04:12,682 --> 00:04:16,352
{\an4}What if they tell
me they love me and
can't bear to be
separated from me?

39
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:19,220
{\an1}What am I going to do
when that happens?

40
00:04:19,254 --> 00:04:21,656
{\an1}I'm scared that they'll
suggest a suicide pact!

41
00:04:22,657 --> 00:04:26,125
{\an1}Do you want to be
drowning in girls or not,
which is it?!

42
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:28,327
{\an1}Look, we haven't even
reached the Hidden
Leaf Village yet!

43
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:31,731
{\an1}Stop getting so carried
away about the damn
girls! It's creepy!

44
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:37,601
{\an4}Come to think of it, Karui,
maybe a handsome guy with a
super good-looking face
will hit on you.

45
00:04:37,635 --> 00:04:39,637
{\an1}Just say handsome guy!

46
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:45,541
{\an4}But you know, now that
you mention it, a
handsome, rich, famous
ninja smitten with me...

47
00:04:45,574 --> 00:04:47,643
{\an1}That wouldn't be very
far-fetched, at all!

48
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:51,145
{\an1}You're overthinking things.
There's no way.

49
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:52,680
<i>No way at all!</i>

50
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:56,416
<i>That's enough...</i>

51
00:04:57,784 --> 00:04:59,920
{\an1}<i>...out of you, you idiot!</i>

52
00:05:05,356 --> 00:05:07,324
{\an1}<i>What are you doing?</i>

53
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:11,327
{\an1}What if that stone hits
a boulder and smashes
it into pieces...

54
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,832
{\an1}And those pieces destroy
an even bigger bolder and
cause a big rockslide...

55
00:05:16,131 --> 00:05:20,134
{\an1}And those rocks fall
onto the Hidden Leaf
Village, and wreck it?

56
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:23,304
{\an1}You're the one that's
thinking too much,
you idiot!

57
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:29,843
[Karui]
No way...

58
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:33,779
{\an1}I didn't do it on
purpose, it was
just a little rock!

59
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:37,214
{\an1}Oh Karui, what have
you done this time?

60
00:05:37,715 --> 00:05:39,082
There's no way.

61
00:05:39,115 --> 00:05:41,417
Come on, let's
find someone.

62
00:05:41,685 --> 00:05:43,819
{\an1}Hey, you! Who are you?!

63
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:46,588
I'm Samui of the
Hidden Cloud.

64
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:49,924
{\an1}I am a messenger from our
leader, the Raikage.

65
00:05:51,091 --> 00:05:52,526
From Lord Raikage?

66
00:05:57,497 --> 00:06:01,999
{\an1}Please pardon our welcome
earlier. We're all a bit on
edge since the attack.

67
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,769
I was surprised not to
run into any Hidden
Leaf lookouts,

68
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:08,939
and then to find the
village in such a
state, What happened?

69
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:12,140
{\an4}Hey, here's that stone you used
to destroy the Leaf Village.
<i>It was the Akatsuki.</i>
<i>Precautions are being taken,</i>

70
00:06:12,174 --> 00:06:13,809
{\an4}You want it?
<i>and security will</i>
<i>be tightened shortly.</i>

71
00:06:13,842 --> 00:06:15,109
Aah! That thing had
nothing to do with it!

72
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:18,246
In any case, I need to
arrange an audience
with the Hokage.

73
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,915
{\an1}I bear a letter from the
Raikage addressed to her.

74
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,351
Well, actually...

75
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:26,185
{\an1}Is something wrong?

76
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,020
{\an1}That hurts!

77
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,723
{\an1}Don't tell me I'm going
to get a lump on my head!

78
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,123
<i>Enough!</i>

79
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,129
Unbelievable.
What horrible timing.

80
00:06:40,496 --> 00:06:44,132
{\an1}There hasn't been a single
piece of good news coming
through the coded channels.

81
00:06:44,165 --> 00:06:46,735
This is calling for
a Five Kage Summit
Conference!

82
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:49,837
{\an1}There, you see? Wait, what?!

83
00:06:52,672 --> 00:06:55,274
What's that?!
The Hokage's
comatose?!

84
00:06:55,742 --> 00:07:00,012
{\an1}Yes, but I'm her aide, so
I can simply accept the
letter on her behalf.

85
00:07:03,581 --> 00:07:08,117
{\an4}If it's uncertain when
she'll regain
consciousness, The
acting Hokage will do.

86
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:11,053
{\an1}I'd like to have the letter
read, And replied to.

87
00:07:11,787 --> 00:07:13,454
{\an1}The Raikage cannot wait.

88
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:15,490
Yes, but...

89
00:07:20,327 --> 00:07:23,162
{\an1}That woman there is no
longer the Hokage.

90
00:07:24,597 --> 00:07:27,599
{\an1}I was recently appointed
the Sixth Hokage.

91
00:07:27,632 --> 00:07:30,835
{\an1}Now hand the letter
over to me, and I'll
answer it.

92
00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:34,170
{\an8}<i>No! It can't</i>
<i>be! Danzo?!</i>

93
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:39,709
{\an1}<i>What's wrong? Does Lord Raikage</i>
<i>want a reply or doesn't he?!</i>

94
00:07:55,988 --> 00:08:00,024
Sasuke, hmm?
So it has come
to this.

95
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,226
{\an1}Sir? Your response?

96
00:08:10,632 --> 00:08:11,700
<i>[Kiba]</i>
<i>There they are!</i>

97
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,001
<i>Hey!</i>

98
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:14,201
Huh?

99
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:17,538
{\an1}Kiba!

100
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:18,438
{\an1}What's wrong?!

101
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:20,773
Listen up.
And just
stay calm!

102
00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:23,575
Lady Tsunade's been
relieved of her title!

103
00:08:24,543 --> 00:08:25,310
What?!

104
00:08:26,378 --> 00:08:28,981
{\an1}Yeah, the Sixth Hokage is
somebody named Danzo.

105
00:08:29,014 --> 00:08:32,049
I don't know much,
but I think he's some
behind-the-scenes guy.

106
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,516
{\an1}Did you say Danzo?!

107
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:35,117
{\an8}<i>Danzo...</i>

108
00:08:36,118 --> 00:08:37,386
{\an1}This can't be good.

109
00:08:38,854 --> 00:08:40,756
{\an1}And that isn't
the only shocker!

110
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:45,459
{\an1}The Sixth Hokage declared
Sasuke a Rogue Ninja and
approved his elimination!

111
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,965
{\an1}Wait, just what do
you mean by that?!

112
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:55,433
{\an1}I don't know, I'm just
telling you what I heard!

113
00:08:55,467 --> 00:09:00,237
{\an4}It means they can't
wait until Lady Tsunade
recovers. It's not
unreasonable.

114
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:01,839
But Kakashi...

115
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:06,109
{\an1}Sasuke's a Rogue Shinobi.
Standard operating
procedure is to erase him.

116
00:09:06,776 --> 00:09:10,244
{\an1}It's only because of Lady
Tsunade that he's been
allowed to live this long.

117
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:14,749
Well, then, I'm going
to talk to Danzo!

118
00:09:14,782 --> 00:09:18,385
Sakura, wait. Barging
into his office won't
solve anything.

119
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:21,854
{\an1}How dare they do this
when Lady Tsunade's
unconscious!

120
00:09:21,887 --> 00:09:26,190
{\an1}And what about Sasuke?
You can't expect me to
just keep quiet!

121
00:09:26,224 --> 00:09:27,892
And I'm going
with you, too.

122
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,927
{\an1}Calm down,
both of you.

123
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:34,097
{\an4}At a time like this,
staying calm is crucial
or everything will get
out of hand.

124
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:38,833
{\an1}And how are we supposed
to stay calm?! I won't
let them go after Sasuke!

125
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:39,901
{\an1}I said wait!

126
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:43,303
{\an1}Danzo has already
anticipated your
exact reaction.

127
00:09:43,337 --> 00:09:45,706
{\an1}So you go see
him, then what?

128
00:09:46,406 --> 00:09:51,710
{\an4}We won't do anything
violent! We're only going
to ask him to change his
decision about Sasuke!

129
00:09:52,277 --> 00:09:56,514
{\an4}Do you really believe
that he'll agree with
whatever you have to say?
No way.

130
00:09:57,048 --> 00:10:01,484
{\an4}It may be just the Feudal
Lords' appointment without
the Jonin Assembly's vote
of confidence yet,

131
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,452
{\an1}but Danzo is Hokage.

132
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:04,988
{\an1}If you play this wrong,

133
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,722
{\an1}<i>you'll be thrown in prison.</i>

134
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:08,389
{\an1}Fine, I don't care!

135
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:09,824
I'm going!

136
00:10:10,491 --> 00:10:11,793
Yeah, me too!

137
00:10:11,826 --> 00:10:13,894
{\an1}Wait, guys. Just hold up.

138
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:16,930
{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>Naruto, the Nine-Tails</i>
<i>is inside you.</i>

139
00:10:18,098 --> 00:10:19,832
Yeah, I know that;
what about it?

140
00:10:20,265 --> 00:10:24,502
{\an4}Look, Danzo would
like nothing better
than to confine you
to this village.

141
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:29,472
{\an4}Do you really want to be
locked up in jail?
Because that's exactly
what he wants.

142
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,275
{\an1}<i>And then you won't be able</i>
<i>to go look for Sasuke.</i>

143
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:35,811
{\an1}<i>Don't make a</i>
<i>scene right now.</i>

144
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:37,713
Tch!

145
00:10:41,115 --> 00:10:42,282
{\an1}<i>[Sai]</i>
<i>You wanted to see me?</i>

146
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,118
Observe Naruto.

147
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:48,188
{\an4}If you see anything
out of the ordinary,
report it to me
immediately.

148
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:50,321
Yes, sir.

149
00:10:53,224 --> 00:10:54,192
Um...

150
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:57,294
Excuse me, may I ask
you a question, sir?

151
00:10:57,928 --> 00:10:59,029
{\an1}What is it?

152
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:00,730
Naruto...

153
00:11:01,797 --> 00:11:03,499
What do you plan
to do with him?

154
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:08,103
{\an4}Don't worry.
Naruto is the
Village's hero
right now.

155
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:14,474
{\an1}All of the villagers trust and
love him. Even more than they
do me, the Sixth Hokage.

156
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:21,312
{\an1}If I were to do something
to him now, it would affect
my new position.

157
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:25,015
This a crucial time,
right before the Jonin's
vote of confidence.

158
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:28,152
{\an1}<i>Still, Naruto is</i>
<i>a Jinchuriki.</i>

159
00:11:29,318 --> 00:11:33,288
{\an1}And as such, it is
the Hokage's job to
watch over him.

160
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:37,192
{\an1}I will not be lenient,
as Tsunade was.

161
00:11:39,626 --> 00:11:40,894
I understand, sir.

162
00:11:44,097 --> 00:11:46,465
{\an1}Very well. Dismissed.

163
00:11:53,403 --> 00:11:54,972
{\an7}<i>Can I really relax?</i>

164
00:11:55,906 --> 00:11:56,874
{\an1}<i>[Sakura]</i>
<i>Sai!</i>

165
00:11:57,573 --> 00:11:59,408
{\an1}Hey, we were just
looking for you!

166
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:01,543
{\an1}Yeah, we really
gotta talk to you.

167
00:12:02,344 --> 00:12:03,311
What is it?

168
00:12:05,646 --> 00:12:08,182
{\an1}Please, tell us what you
know about Danzo.

169
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:12,352
{\an1}Sai!

170
00:12:12,886 --> 00:12:13,820
No, I can't.

171
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,354
What?! Why not?!

172
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:18,023
{\an1}No way. Then you're
back on his side!?

173
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:21,025
No, It's nothing
like that.

174
00:12:21,058 --> 00:12:24,895
{\an1}To speak about Lord Danzo is a
physical impossibility for me.

175
00:12:26,263 --> 00:12:27,429
Because of this.

176
00:12:33,235 --> 00:12:34,769
What is
that thing?!

177
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:36,938
{\an1}Is that a Curse Mark?

178
00:12:37,238 --> 00:12:41,108
{\an1}Yes, it is. A jutsu cast
by Lord Danzo himself.

179
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:47,412
{\an5}If I try to talk about
him, my body becomes
completely paralyzed,
unable to speak or move.

180
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:48,814
In the Foundation,

181
00:12:49,713 --> 00:12:52,249
{\an1}Every member bears one.

182
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:55,985
{\an1}He's a cautious man.

183
00:12:56,753 --> 00:12:59,621
Lord Danzo and the
Foundation work in
espionage.

184
00:13:00,022 --> 00:13:03,858
{\an1}Behind the scenes, they've
done lots of dirty work to
protect the Leaf.

185
00:13:06,227 --> 00:13:09,462
{\an1}<i>Which is why we have to</i>
<i>take steps to prevent</i>
<i>any intel leaks.</i>

186
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,733
{\an1}<i>Such as making sure we</i>
<i>can't spill a word even</i>
<i>if we're captured.</i>

187
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,704
{\an4}But that's so extreme!
I mean, putting a
Curse Mark on your own
subordinate!

188
00:13:19,737 --> 00:13:20,938
{\an1}That's awful!

189
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:24,841
That may be true, but
it has allowed us to
keep the Leaf safe.

190
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:30,946
{\an1}His methods may be heavy
handed, But he cares deeply
about the Village. Like you.

191
00:13:31,246 --> 00:13:35,683
{\an1}But if that's true, then why
did he overturn Lady Tsunade's
decision about Sasuke?

192
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:39,419
{\an1}Danzo's planning to
dispatch Tracking Ninja
to go after him!

193
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,587
Ah!
What, really?

194
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,589
{\an1}He didn't mention that.
Sasuke--

195
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:48,492
{\an1}Go on, keep talking. Tell
us all about this Sasuke!

196
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:50,995
{\an1}You guys seem to be such
good friends with him.

197
00:13:57,466 --> 00:13:58,701
{\an1}Shadow Clone Jutsu.

198
00:13:58,734 --> 00:13:59,734
Don't kill him!

199
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:00,568
<i>[Karui]</i>
<i>I know!</i>

200
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:04,638
Well.

201
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,441
Sakura!

202
00:14:12,777 --> 00:14:14,379
{\an1}Sakura! You okay?

203
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,350
{\an1}They're from the Hidden Cloud.
You can tell by their headbands.

204
00:14:18,883 --> 00:14:19,917
{\an7}<i>Why are they here?</i>

205
00:14:21,885 --> 00:14:23,453
What the hell do
you guys want?

206
00:14:23,887 --> 00:14:27,089
We just overheard the
three of you talking
about Sasuke Uchiha.

207
00:14:27,122 --> 00:14:29,423
{\an1}We want to know about him,
and you're going to tell us.

208
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,994
Why? What does all of
this have to do with you
Cloud ninja anyway?

209
00:14:33,294 --> 00:14:36,364
{\an1}A whole lot! 'Cause Sasuke
Uchiha of the Leaf,

210
00:14:36,663 --> 00:14:38,564
{\an1}Assaulted the Hidden
Cloud Village!

211
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:40,200
[gasps]

212
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:44,270
{\an4}You heard him;
your Rogue Shinobi
kidnapped our
beloved master!

213
00:14:44,836 --> 00:14:47,138
{\an1}We don't even know if
he's dead or alive!

214
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:48,906
{\an1}That's... a lie!

215
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:50,774
{\an1}Sasuke...

216
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,808
{\an1}Why would he ever do
something like that?!

217
00:14:52,842 --> 00:14:55,211
{\an1}How the hell should we know
the Akatsuki's motives?!

218
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,047
The Akatsuki?!
What are you
talking about?

219
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,482
{\an1}Uggh! You guys are
trying my patience!

220
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:03,884
{\an1}Of course, Sasuke's a
member of the Akatsuki!

221
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:09,621
{\an4}It's because you let
your Rogue Ninja run
loose that Lord Raikage
dispatched us here!

222
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:12,858
{\an1}<i>We've already gotten</i>
<i>the Hokage's permission</i>
<i>to get rid of him!</i>

223
00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:18,428
{\an7}<i>Sasuke... kidnapped</i>
<i>their master?</i>

224
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:21,264
We will avenge
our master!

225
00:15:21,298 --> 00:15:23,266
{\an1}We're going to
take down Sasuke!

226
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:26,302
{\an8}<i>Sasuke...</i>

227
00:15:30,704 --> 00:15:35,108
{\an7}<i>How could you do</i>
<i>something like that?</i>
<i>What's happened to you?</i>

228
00:15:46,884 --> 00:15:48,484
Hey, Sasuke.

229
00:15:52,855 --> 00:15:56,191
{\an7}<i>His chakra came out of nowhere!</i>
<i>How is that possible?!</i>

230
00:15:57,326 --> 00:15:59,860
[sigh] Talk about
bad timing.

231
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,562
{\an1}How the hell did you know
where I was, anyway?

232
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:07,833
{\an1}Do not take me lightly.
I have powers beyond
your comprehension.

233
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,534
{\an1}So what do you
want from me?

234
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,637
{\an1}Team Taka left the
Akatsuki a long time ago.

235
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,006
{\an1}We have no further
business with you.

236
00:16:15,706 --> 00:16:19,376
I warned you that you
would die if you
betrayed the Akatsuki.

237
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:21,243
What are you
talking about?

238
00:16:21,277 --> 00:16:23,212
The hunt for the
Tailed-Beasts.

239
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:27,048
{\an4}But we already captured
the Eight-Tails for you
and handed him over
like you asked!

240
00:16:27,349 --> 00:16:31,986
{\an1}That was a substitution.
In short, you blundered.

241
00:16:32,286 --> 00:16:33,486
Eh?
Huh?

242
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,688
{\an1}<i>It seems Eight-Tails</i>
<i>pulled a fast one on you.</i>

243
00:16:37,522 --> 00:16:40,192
{\an7}<i>I was watching him with the</i>
<i>Sharingan the whole time.</i>

244
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:42,427
{\an7}<i>He had no opportunity</i>
<i>to make a clone!</i>

245
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,364
Ah!

246
00:16:46,397 --> 00:16:48,732
{\an7}<i>It must have been when I</i>
<i>sliced off that tentacle!</i>

247
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:52,634
{\an1}Honestly, all of you
have disappointed me.

248
00:16:53,202 --> 00:16:57,171
{\an5}So what do you want
us to do about it?
I mean, it's not our
business anymore!

249
00:16:57,338 --> 00:17:01,540
{\an1}Wrong. You will complete the
job you were assigned when
you were with the Akatsuki.

250
00:17:01,842 --> 00:17:05,144
{\an1}Having said that,
you can forget about
the Eight-Tails.

251
00:17:05,177 --> 00:17:08,381
{\an1}I have decided to
have you carry out a
different mission.

252
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,383
{\an1}And? What if we decline?

253
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:17,221
{\an4}Then we'll fight it out
right here. And you won't
be able to go to the
Hidden Leaf Village.

254
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:19,322
{\an1}We'll push through!

255
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:20,989
Huh?

256
00:17:27,194 --> 00:17:29,763
{\an1}It's a little too
late to go to the
Hidden Leaf, anyway.

257
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:36,502
{\an7}<i>I passed right through</i>
<i>him, just like before.</i>
<i>Is this one of his powers?</i>

258
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:42,140
{\an1}Your objective seems
so futile, now.
It's sad, really.

259
00:17:42,173 --> 00:17:43,408
And what does that mean?

260
00:17:44,341 --> 00:17:48,244
{\an1}The Village Hidden in
the Leaves is no more.

261
00:17:50,246 --> 00:17:51,480
What are you
talking about?!

262
00:17:54,182 --> 00:17:57,918
{\an5}[Black Zetsu]
I can explain
everything that
happened in the Leaf.

263
00:17:58,485 --> 00:17:59,520
{\an1}W-what is that?!

264
00:17:59,852 --> 00:18:03,056
Relax. He's an
associate of mine.

265
00:18:03,655 --> 00:18:06,358
{\an1}So, who's the
new Hokage?

266
00:18:06,825 --> 00:18:08,726
[White Zetsu]
It's that fellow Danzo.

267
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:11,228
{\an1}Just as I anticipated.

268
00:18:11,462 --> 00:18:14,230
{\an1}Danzo?! He's Hokage now?!

269
00:18:14,664 --> 00:18:17,699
{\an1}Yes, one of the
high-ranking elders
of the Leaf Village,

270
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:19,902
{\an1}who backed your
brother into a corner,

271
00:18:19,935 --> 00:18:23,004
{\an1}That's the man who's
become the new Hokage.

272
00:18:23,805 --> 00:18:26,573
Just what the hell
happened in the
Hidden Leaf Village?!

273
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,910
{\an1}My subordinate,
Pain, destroyed it.

274
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:32,678
{\an1}And thanks to both you
and Pain showing off,

275
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,814
{\an1}it seems that the
Five Kage are going
to take action.

276
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:38,383
The Five Kage?

277
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,285
They're convening a
Summit Conference.

278
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:44,587
{\an1}[White Zetsu]
Allow me.
I'll explain it all.

279
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:49,724
{\an1}Now tell us everything
you know about Sasuke.

280
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:53,462
{\an1}And I don't mean just
his ninjutsu style
and his abilities.

281
00:18:53,495 --> 00:18:58,131
{\an4}But also any data
that you've collected
about his companions
and the Akatsuki,

282
00:18:58,164 --> 00:19:00,500
{\an1}and information
about their past
activities, too.

283
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:02,569
{\an1}You lie. There's no way.

284
00:19:02,868 --> 00:19:05,104
Sasuke would never
join the Akatsuki!

285
00:19:05,137 --> 00:19:07,071
{\an1}Listen, are you sure?

286
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:11,608
{\an5}Yeah! He had on
the Uchiha crest!
And his face
matches the list.

287
00:19:12,342 --> 00:19:13,510
But that's...

288
00:19:14,578 --> 00:19:16,412
No, it can't be true!

289
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:19,448
[crying]

290
00:19:20,014 --> 00:19:23,384
{\an1}What are you crying for?
We're the ones who
should be weeping here!

291
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,020
{\an1}But tears won't bring
back Lord Killer Bee
or Lady Yugito!

292
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:30,655
{\an1}If you have time to cry,
you have time to tell us
about Sasuke!

293
00:19:31,324 --> 00:19:33,158
{\an1}Please, hold on
for just a minute.

294
00:19:33,391 --> 00:19:34,625
Are you serious?!

295
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,462
{\an1}Just listen. When the
order to take down
Sasuke was approved,

296
00:19:38,496 --> 00:19:42,665
{\an4}The Intel that the Leaf
has on him should have
been handed over to you
and your people.

297
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:46,235
{\an1}Leave these two alone.
It's not necessary to
pressure them.

298
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,170
{\an1}Yeah, I know, you're right.

299
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:51,372
{\an1}And our captain is busy
waiting for the data right now.

300
00:19:51,405 --> 00:19:53,974
{\an1}But we just figured
that we'd try to get
additional information

301
00:19:54,007 --> 00:19:56,576
{\an1}from anyone who might know
something, that's all.

302
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:58,478
We can't sit and
do nothing!

303
00:19:58,878 --> 00:20:00,546
Not when our
master's gone.

304
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,381
<i>We don't even know</i>
<i>what happened to him!</i>

305
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:08,452
{\an1}I will avenge Pervy Sage!

306
00:20:08,986 --> 00:20:12,523
{\an1}I can't just sit around
here doing nothing!

307
00:20:14,856 --> 00:20:19,060
{\an4}But outsiders like you guys
probably have no idea what
we're going through now.

308
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:22,963
Is your master a
Jinchuriki?

309
00:20:23,464 --> 00:20:24,632
How did you know that?

310
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:29,402
{\an1}I'm a Jinchuriki, too.
The Akatsuki are
hunting all of us.

311
00:20:30,035 --> 00:20:31,869
So I'm not just
an outsider.

312
00:20:32,737 --> 00:20:36,073
{\an1}The Akatsuki always capture
a Jinchuriki alive.

313
00:20:36,107 --> 00:20:39,142
{\an1}And that means your master
may still be alive right now.

314
00:20:39,376 --> 00:20:40,043
What?

315
00:20:40,076 --> 00:20:41,144
{\an1}Are you serious?

316
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:45,147
{\an1}Forget Sasuke.
You need to go rescue
your master first.

317
00:20:45,614 --> 00:20:48,583
{\an1}You sure about this?!
Like really, really sure?

318
00:20:48,616 --> 00:20:52,886
{\an1}I told you, didn't I?
No way our master would
die as easily as that!

319
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,557
{\an1}Tell you what, I'll come
along and do what I can
to help you rescue him.

320
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,690
{\an1}And give you
all I've got on
the Akatsuki.

321
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,927
{\an1}Hey, you know what,
there, blondie?
You're pretty sharp.

322
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:06,530
{\an1}Come along with us.
And tell us all
about Sasuke!

323
00:21:07,797 --> 00:21:09,065
Naruto...

324
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,368
{\an1}Just let me handle this, Sakura.

325
00:21:15,237 --> 00:21:17,406
{\an1}So, kid,
What's your name?

326
00:21:20,074 --> 00:21:22,375
Naruto Uzumaki.

327
00:22:56,781 --> 00:23:00,084
{\an4}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>I can't. There's</i>
<i>no way that I can</i>
<i>sell Sasuke out.</i>

328
00:23:00,118 --> 00:23:03,754
{\an4}<i>[Karui]</i>
<i>Quit playing around!</i>
<i>You can't take it back</i>
<i>now, after all that!</i>

329
00:23:03,787 --> 00:23:05,656
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>I know that I'm</i>
<i>only being selfish.</i>

330
00:23:05,689 --> 00:23:10,058
{\an1}<i>But if this continues,</i>
<i>the vicious cycle will</i>
<i>start all over again!</i>

331
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:12,727
{\an1}<i>[Karui]</i>
<i>Your Sasuke is the one</i>
<i>who started it all!</i>

332
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:16,230
{\an1}<i>[Omoi]</i>
<i>Just where do you suggest that</i>
<i>we take our hatred, then?</i>

333
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:20,566
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden,</i>
<i>The Eve of the Five Kage Summit</i>

334
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,336
{\an1}<i>[Sai]</i>
<i>Naruto, why do you go</i>
<i>so far for Sasuke?</i>
