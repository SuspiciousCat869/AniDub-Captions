1
00:00:14,028 --> 00:00:16,163
{\an1}<i>(Orochimaru) [screams] Bugs are</i>
<i>super gross!</i>

2
00:00:17,564 --> 00:00:19,099
{\an1}<i>(Orochimaru) There are bugs</i>
<i>here, too!</i>

3
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:22,636
{\an1}<i>(Orochimaru) Bugs! Everywhere!</i>

4
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:29,676
{\an1}Good job. But what's happened to
the ones who haven't returned
yet?

5
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,611
Huh?

6
00:00:30,644 --> 00:00:32,480
{\an1}What's up with all these bugs?!
Ugh.

7
00:00:32,514 --> 00:00:36,717
{\an1}Go on, Tsukune! Chase 'em all
away! Ugh, I just can't stand
bugs.

8
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:39,854
{\an1}These are weird! I wanna catch
'em and add 'em to my
collection!

9
00:00:39,888 --> 00:00:41,756
{\an1}Uh, please cut it out, kids.

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,160
{\an1}The reason is because those
insects are my friends.

11
00:00:45,193 --> 00:00:46,795
{\an1}These bugs are your friends?!

12
00:00:46,828 --> 00:00:48,897
{\an1}So what's the deal with this old
guy, anyway?

13
00:00:49,564 --> 00:00:51,467
{\an1}[groans] Those troublemakers.

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,137
{\an1}It's time for their after-school
study session. Where'd they go?
Huh?

15
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:55,904
<i>(Sansho) No way!</i>

16
00:00:57,273 --> 00:00:59,808
{\an1}Whoa, that is really cool! I've
never seen an Insect User
before!

17
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:03,045
{\an1}You know, being able to do that
would make me a huge hit at
parties!

18
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:06,415
{\an1}No way! Then the party would be
crawling with a whole bunch of
gross bugs!

19
00:01:06,449 --> 00:01:08,317
{\an1}It seems that you don't like
insects.

20
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,754
{\an1}But if you keep living with
them, you actually become quite
attached to them.

21
00:01:11,787 --> 00:01:12,822
[awes]

22
00:01:14,223 --> 00:01:17,693
{\an1}[excited] Hey, maybe you're
right! I guess they are kinda
cute.

23
00:01:17,726 --> 00:01:19,429
{\an1}I wanna try that, too!

24
00:01:19,463 --> 00:01:22,131
{\an1}Do you think you might want to
become an Insect User?

25
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:26,769
{\an1}Nah, there's no way that's
gonna happen. This guy wants to
become the Hokage one day.

26
00:01:26,802 --> 00:01:27,937
The Hokage?

27
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:32,142
{\an1}That's right! I wanna surpass
Naruto Uzumaki as a shinobi.

28
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,913
{\an1}I see. Well, to do that, you'll
have to become the Hokage, then.

29
00:01:36,947 --> 00:01:38,982
{\an1}That's what I said! You think
so, too?

30
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,384
{\an1}Well in that case, I guess I'll
become Hokage!

31
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:45,255
{\an1}I know someone else who wants to
become the Hokage.

32
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,159
{\an1}But you know what? I think
you're the top contender.

33
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,929
{\an1}The reason is because no one
says they'll be Hokage as an
afterthought.

34
00:01:52,963 --> 00:01:56,534
{\an1}<i>(Tsukune) Yeah, I know, right?</i>
<i>See, I'm the top contender!</i>

35
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:58,569
{\an1}<i>(Sansho) Top contender for</i>
<i>running your mouth.</i>

36
00:01:58,603 --> 00:02:00,938
{\an1}<i>(Tsukune) Shut up! You'll</i>
<i>see in ten years!</i>

37
00:02:01,405 --> 00:02:03,574
{\an1}So you want to be Hokage, too?

38
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:06,477
{\an1}Oh, no. I never really gave
much thought to it.

39
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:08,846
{\an1}You just wanted to become an
Insect User?

40
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:11,649
{\an1}Uh, yes, that's right.

41
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:15,587
{\an1}So your dream came true! Just
what do you have to do to make
that happen?

42
00:02:15,621 --> 00:02:18,490
{\an1}'Cause I wanna take the first
step toward mine as soon as I
can!

43
00:02:18,524 --> 00:02:22,094
{\an1}I'd have to say the first step
in doing that is to...

44
00:02:22,528 --> 00:02:24,829
{\an1}Wait! What time is it now, you
guys?!

45
00:02:24,862 --> 00:02:27,798
{\an1}Oh, no, we're gonna be late! We
forgot our study session!

46
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,137
{\an1}Better hurry back, And do your
very best to surpass Naruto.

47
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:36,341
{\an1}Yeah! I'll make my dream come
true, just like you! Well, see
ya!

48
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,276
{\an1}<i>(Mibuna) [chuckles]</i>

49
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:42,582
{\an1}"My dreams," huh?

50
00:04:29,726 --> 00:04:31,160
Sorry I'm late.

51
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:34,665
{\an1}It's about time, Shino! Anyway,
how'd it go?

52
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:38,868
{\an1}It seems that just about
everyone else has already gotten
their wedding gift.

53
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:42,506
{\an1}Well then, guess we'd better
figure out what we're gonna get,
too.

54
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:48,245
{\an1}Now listen, Shino. Kakashi
Sensei told us all that this is
a mission, right?

55
00:04:48,844 --> 00:04:53,083
{\an1}I understand why he and
everybody else are making it
sound like a big deal.

56
00:04:53,383 --> 00:04:58,221
{\an1}But in all honesty, as far as
I'm concerned, this truly is a
serious mission.

57
00:04:59,056 --> 00:05:02,493
{\an1}In terms of Team 8, this could
be our final mission.

58
00:05:02,893 --> 00:05:04,895
{\an1}This is Team 8's final
mission?

59
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:08,999
{\an1}Yeah. I mean, once Hinata's
married, I really doubt that
we're gonna get much chance...

60
00:05:09,032 --> 00:05:10,867
{\an1}to work together the way we used
to.

61
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:12,637
Yeah.

62
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,039
{\an1}Guess that's true.

63
00:05:16,674 --> 00:05:19,644
{\an1}And I'm gonna have to get even
more serious if I intend on
actually becoming...

64
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:23,816
{\an1}the next Hokage. I can't keep
relying on you all the time,
Shino.

65
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,118
{\an1}Yes. We ought to keep it that
way.

66
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:29,487
{\an1}All right, what's that supposed
to mean, huh?!

67
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,122
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:32,558 --> 00:05:35,193
{\an1}Anyway, we really should stay
focused on our last mission as
Team 8.

69
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:38,162
{\an1}Especially since it's for
Hinata. Is that what you're
saying?

70
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,299
{\an1}Yeah, you sure got that right!

71
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:44,837
{\an1}So the question is, what are we
gonna get them for a gift? Hmm.

72
00:05:45,504 --> 00:05:47,872
{\an1}<i>(Kurenai) So you need a gift for</i>
<i>Hinata, huh?</i>

73
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:50,609
{\an1}It's gonna be for her and for
Naruto.

74
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,813
{\an1}Do you have any idea what we
could give them that would make
them happy?

75
00:05:53,847 --> 00:05:57,751
{\an1}Akakiba! Akakiba and Kibamaru!

76
00:05:57,784 --> 00:06:03,423
{\an1}Almost, Mirai! But you're still
mixing up the names. Sorry, I'm
kinda busy right now, okay?

77
00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:07,893
{\an1}[chuckles] Instead of hot tea,
it might be nice to relax with a
little shochu.

78
00:06:08,428 --> 00:06:12,931
{\an1}Oh, that reminds me. Have you
ever heard the story about the
Senju Clan?

79
00:06:12,965 --> 00:06:13,633
Hmm?

80
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,636
{\an1}Long ago, so the story says...

81
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:20,507
{\an1}the Senju Clan maintained a
tradition of giving honey wine
as a wedding gift.

82
00:06:21,374 --> 00:06:25,311
{\an1}<i>(Kurenai) Back then, the Senju</i>
<i>Clan lived in the forest, and</i>
<i>they happened to discover...</i>

83
00:06:25,345 --> 00:06:29,382
{\an1}<i>an unusual liquid produced</i>
<i>from rainwater that collected in</i>
<i>beehives. </i>

84
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,585
{\an1}<i>That was the start of honey</i>
<i>wine.</i>

85
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:35,188
{\an1}It was a nourishing wine and
also quite rare.

86
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:39,326
{\an1}Since that time, it's been
served only during auspicious
occasions.

87
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,497
{\an1}Honey wine could be used as a
medicinal tonic as well as for
cooking.

88
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:46,333
{\an1}Hinata would find good uses for
it.

89
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:48,335
{\an1}[chuckles] It might be
the perfect gift for her!

90
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:52,674
{\an1}It also conveys the wish that
Hinata and Naruto spend their
days together...

91
00:06:53,107 --> 00:06:54,709
{\an1}Living in sweetness.

92
00:06:54,743 --> 00:06:58,513
{\an1}Hah! That was a seriously cheesy
joke! Hinata'd groan if she
heard that!

93
00:07:02,784 --> 00:07:07,054
{\an1}I have to say, it's strange
seeing you two doing things
together without Hinata.

94
00:07:07,087 --> 00:07:09,658
{\an1}But I guess I'll get used to
it eventually.

95
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:13,995
{\an1}[chewing] Where can we go to get
some of this honey wine, anyway?

96
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:18,066
{\an1}<i>(Kurenai) I'm not entirely sure,</i>
<i>but there's a place called</i>
<i>Soraku.</i>

97
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:20,670
{\an1}<i>Seems there's a beekeeper living</i>
<i>there who makes it.</i>

98
00:07:20,937 --> 00:07:23,840
{\an1}Tracking's your specialty, so it
should be easy!

99
00:07:23,873 --> 00:07:26,274
{\an1}Okay, then it's decided.

100
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:28,778
{\an1}Let's get over there and find
this beekeeper.

101
00:07:29,345 --> 00:07:32,248
{\an1}Bye bye, Kibamaru and Akakiba!

102
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:36,686
{\an1}All right, it's Team 8's final
mission! So let's do this, you
guys!

103
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:37,553
[eager bark]

104
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:39,422
{\an1}It's our last mission, huh?

105
00:07:46,429 --> 00:07:48,264
{\an1}It's quite a desolate place.

106
00:07:48,297 --> 00:07:50,533
{\an1}I'll say! It's completely
depressing, too.

{\an1}<i>(Momo) Sorry, it's so</i>
<i>depressing, meow.</i>

{\an1}Is that a ninja cat?!

115
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:13,023
{\an1}We've come here in order to find
a beekeeper who lives in a place
known as Soraku.

116
00:08:13,056 --> 00:08:14,725
{\an1}We aren't sketchy guys.

117
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,327
{\an1}[grunts] You're totally
sketchy, meow!

118
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:20,430
{\an1}And I'm not gonna tell you
anything I know, meow!

119
00:08:20,464 --> 00:08:24,101
{\an1}That must mean you know
something, like where this
beekeeper is, right?

120
00:08:24,134 --> 00:08:28,640
{\an1}Okay, then I guess we gotta
catch this ninja cat and get the
information out of it!

121
00:08:28,673 --> 00:08:30,742
{\an1}C'mon, Akamaru, let's do it!

122
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:31,409
[eager bark]

00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:33,845
{\an1}Foolish humans, meow!

{\an1}[chuckles] Tada! Here!

130
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:56,335
Go on...

131
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:58,637
{\an1}What are those? Food pills?

132
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:03,242
{\an1}This is something called dog
mint. It's a kind of herb that's
similar to catnip!

133
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:06,211
{\an1}Well? You can't resist it, can
you?

got caught by someone who reeks
like a dog, meow!

{\an1}<i>(Kiba) Hey! Come back!</i>

137
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,958
{\an1}You're not supposed to just
steal it and run off, ya damn
cat!

138
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,060
Momo!

139
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:20,827
[grunts]

140
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,763
{\an1}[frightened meows]

141
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:27,500
{\an1}All right, just who are you
guys? And why are chasing my
Momo!

142
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,836
{\an1}Must be the ninja cat's
master.

143
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,005
{\an1}Akamaru! Kiba! Careful!

144
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,976
{\an1}Oh, hey. So its name's Momo,
huh?

145
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:40,347
{\an1}[chuckles] Well, well! Fancy
that! And let me introduce my
dog: his name's Akamaru.

146
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,349
[sighs]

147
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:48,421
{\an1}[chuckles] So, let me guess, by
any chance was my cat rude to
you earlier? If so, I'm sorry.

148
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:51,626
{\an1}No, no, not at all! You've got
quite a cute little ninja cat!

149
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:55,763
{\an1}[scoffs] What the hell are you
talking about?! Just a minute
ago, you called me a "damn cat!"

150
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:58,265
{\an1}Oh, yeah. And my name is Tamaki.

151
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:02,169
{\an1}Hey, there. I'm Kiba. And this
is my ninja dog, Akamaru.

152
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:04,940
{\an1}What?! You're a ninja hound
user?! Oh, wow!

153
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,410
{\an1}Oh, you know! [cocky chuckle]
It's nothing, really.

154
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:13,414
{\an1}Although, to let you in on a
little secret, I'm actually one
of just a handful...

155
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:16,317
{\an1}of people on the inside track to
becoming the next Hokage.

156
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,588
{\an1}Whoa, the next Hokage?! That's
amazing!

157
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:21,089
{\an1}Yeah, it is. [chuckles]

158
00:10:21,123 --> 00:10:22,357
{\an1}[embarrassed whine]

159
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:25,927
{\an1}So what's such an important
person like you doing in a place
like this?

160
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:27,729
{\an1}Well, actually, we're...

161
00:10:29,464 --> 00:10:32,035
{\an1}We're on a mission to track
down a beekeeper who supposedly
lives in Soraku somewhere.

162
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:35,038
{\an1}Oh, him? Would you like me to
guide you part of the way?

163
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:37,406
{\an1}Really?! You know him?! Yeah,
that'd be just great!

164
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,108
Right, Shino?

165
00:10:39,142 --> 00:10:40,275
{\an1}[exasperated sigh]

166
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:49,452
{\an1}He lives deep in the bamboo
grove beyond here.

167
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:55,058
{\an1}You probably won't be able to
find him, meow. Even cats get
lost in there, meow.

168
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:58,062
{\an1}We're shinobi! Getting lost
isn't something that we do!

169
00:10:58,095 --> 00:11:00,263
{\an1}All right, good luck! Be
careful!

170
00:11:00,296 --> 00:11:01,932
{\an1}Yeah! Thanks for your help!

171
00:11:15,846 --> 00:11:17,681
Yes, I know.

172
00:11:21,618 --> 00:11:23,420
Intruders.

173
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:33,230
{\an1}First, I'll track this guy down
with my nose. And then, when I
find him, send in your insects.

174
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:35,432
[sneezes]

175
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:39,137
{\an1}Hah! Hey, do you think that girl
we met is talking about us?

176
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,305
{\an1}You got a crush on her?

177
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:45,275
{\an1}Come on! Have you lost your
mind?! No, it's nothing like
that!

178
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:48,913
{\an1}This is a crucial time if I'm
gonna become Hokage! There's no
time for love!

179
00:11:49,647 --> 00:11:51,649
{\an1}You're too easy to read, Kiba.

180
00:11:51,683 --> 00:11:53,518
{\an1}Huh? What did you say?

181
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:56,654
{\an1}[groans] Nothing. I just said
that I envy you.

182
00:11:56,688 --> 00:11:59,125
{\an1}Oh? Really? You do, huh?

183
00:12:01,392 --> 00:12:03,796
{\an1}And I'm gonna have to get even
more serious if...

184
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:06,631
{\an1}I intend on actually becoming
the next Hokage.

185
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:13,205
{\an7}<i>Kiba always talks big, and maybe</i>
<i>I've dismissed him too much</i>
<i>because of that.</i>

186
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:16,274
{\an8}<i>However...</i>

187
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:26,452
{\an1}I'd have to say the first step
in doing that is to...

188
00:12:26,886 --> 00:12:29,488
{\an7}<i>Who am I to criticize anyone?</i>

189
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,961
{\an1}I mean, once Hinata's married, I
really doubt that we're gonna
get much chance...

190
00:12:34,995 --> 00:12:36,730
{\an1}to work together the way we used
to.

191
00:12:37,764 --> 00:12:40,332
{\an7}<i>The way we used to. Huh.</i>

192
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:42,235
Huh?

193
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:47,974
{\an1}Kiba! Hey, Kiba! Where are you?!

194
00:12:56,516 --> 00:12:59,386
{\an1}What, really? You guys don't
know where he is either?

195
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:02,622
{\an1}This is most definitely due to
somebody's jutsu.

196
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:08,262
{\an1}Yellow jackets, huh?

197
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:14,635
{\an1}What is this jutsu?!

198
00:13:16,037 --> 00:13:16,971
[grunts]

199
00:13:22,376 --> 00:13:25,680
{\an1}You're from the Aburame Clan of
the Hidden Leaf.

200
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:27,316
{\an1}<i>(Shino) That's right.</i>

201
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,150
[gasps]

202
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:33,055
{\an1}You're skilled if you can
deceive me.

203
00:13:33,554 --> 00:13:36,191
{\an1}<i>(Beekeeper) But how? The poison</i>
<i>should've...</i>

204
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:39,027
{\an1}The poison did get me, but it's
not a problem.

205
00:13:39,061 --> 00:13:43,031
{\an1}The reason is because this small
amount of poison isn't enough to
kill me.

206
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:47,970
{\an1}Well, then, this is my loss. I
guess that it can't be helped.

207
00:13:48,003 --> 00:13:52,108
{\an1}I'm proud to die by the hand of
an Insect User of your caliber.

208
00:13:52,141 --> 00:13:53,442
No, wait.

209
00:13:54,944 --> 00:13:57,947
{\an1}I didn't come all the way in
here to kill you. I want your
honey wine.

210
00:13:58,748 --> 00:13:59,749
Huh?

211
00:14:04,654 --> 00:14:06,990
{\an1}Thanks so much. How much is it?

212
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:10,460
{\an1}Oh, just take it. Money means
nothing to me.

213
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:15,932
{\an1}I see. Well, if you could just
point me toward the road back,
I'd be very grateful.

214
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,568
{\an1}There is no road back.

215
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:21,471
{\an1}Hm? What do you mean
by that?

216
00:14:21,504 --> 00:14:22,872
{\an1}Just what I said!

217
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:27,510
{\an1}<i>(Beekeeper) This bamboo grove is</i>
<i>surrounded by something like a</i>
<i>barrier.</i>

218
00:14:27,543 --> 00:14:31,015
{\an1}<i>Once you step inside, there's no</i>
<i>way to get back out.</i>

219
00:14:31,048 --> 00:14:35,653
{\an1}<i>Try to leave, and you'll only</i>
<i>continue to wander through an</i>
<i>endless fog, that's all. </i>

220
00:14:35,686 --> 00:14:37,721
{\an1}That's what this jutsu does.

221
00:14:37,755 --> 00:14:39,056
No way!

222
00:14:43,594 --> 00:14:44,662
Huh?

223
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:50,701
{\an1}<i>(Beekeeper) I'm sorry to tell</i>
<i>you but this jutsu cannot be</i>
<i>broken. Not even if you kill me.</i>

224
00:14:51,435 --> 00:14:53,204
{\an1}What do you mean?! How?!

225
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:56,875
{\an1}<i>(Beekeeper) Originally, this</i>
<i>mist contained a special</i>
<i>component...</i>

226
00:14:56,908 --> 00:14:59,210
{\an1}<i>that was meant to lead</i>
<i>people astray. </i>

227
00:14:59,244 --> 00:15:05,418
{\an1}<i>When I made my jutsu formula, I</i>
<i>incorporated a little of that</i>
<i>component into it.</i>

228
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,987
{\an1}But that can't be the reason
that the jutsu can't be broken!

229
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,955
<i>(Beekeeper) No.</i>

230
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:14,626
{\an1}<i>You see, the nasty thing about</i>
<i>this jutsu is that it takes the</i>
<i>doubt inside its victims...</i>

231
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:18,364
{\an1}<i>and turns it into fog, making</i>
<i>it thicker and thicker.</i>

232
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:19,597
It what?!

233
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:21,566
{\an1}<i>(Beekeeper) Haven't you noticed?</i>

234
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,770
{\an1}<i>This bamboo grove makes people</i>
<i>lose their way.</i>

235
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:29,742
{\an1}<i>And when the jutsu is activated,</i>
<i>the thicker fog confuses them</i>
<i>even more.</i>

236
00:15:29,775 --> 00:15:33,179
{\an1}<i>In other words, this jutsu has</i>
<i>no effect on someone...</i>

237
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:35,848
{\an1}<i>who does not harbor doubts</i>
<i>within themselves. </i>

238
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:38,951
{\an1}So you're saying that I'm filled
with doubt?

239
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:42,389
{\an1}Yeah! I'll make my dream come
true, just like you!

240
00:15:42,422 --> 00:15:46,193
{\an1}I mean, once Hinata's married, I
really doubt that we're gonna
get much chance...

241
00:15:46,226 --> 00:15:47,928
{\an1}to work together the way we used
to.

242
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:52,966
{\an1}I have to say, it's strange
seeing you two doing things
together without Hinata.

243
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,302
{\an1}But I guess I'll get used to it
eventually.

244
00:15:55,736 --> 00:15:58,038
{\an1}I get what it all means now.

245
00:16:03,677 --> 00:16:09,983
{\an1}I've really been questioning
just how I'll live as a shinobi
once Team 8 finally disbands.

246
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:11,852
{\an1}After Hinata has gotten
married.

247
00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:16,224
{\an1}<i>(Shino) To always be together</i>
<i>with my friends in Team 8.</i>

248
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:20,061
{\an1}That was my most cherished
dream.

249
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:23,563
<i>(Shino) I see.</i>

250
00:16:23,597 --> 00:16:25,800
{\an1}<i>I was just doubting</i>
<i>myself.</i>

251
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:28,569
{\an1}<i>(Beekeeper) You and I are alike,</i>
<i>you know. </i>

252
00:16:28,603 --> 00:16:32,740
{\an1}<i>I still find myself feeling lost</i>
<i>on this path called life.</i>

253
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:34,542
{\an1}So, what do you say?

254
00:16:34,575 --> 00:16:40,915
{\an1}There may be doubt here, but
there is no true suffering. I'm
finally really living life now!

255
00:16:40,948 --> 00:16:44,619
{\an1}Your friends would understand,
too! I'm sure of it.

256
00:16:44,652 --> 00:16:48,824
{\an1}It's okay to have doubts. It's
not your fault that you have
them.

257
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:54,063
Kiba. Hinata.

258
00:16:54,696 --> 00:16:57,599
{\an1}You don't always have to keep
pushing forward!

259
00:16:57,633 --> 00:17:01,336
{\an1}Just abandon it all, and stay
here with your doubts.

260
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:04,973
{\an1}If you agree, then just stay
here with us!

261
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:06,409
{\an1}Yeah, Shino, come on!

262
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,743
Just stay!

263
00:17:13,682 --> 00:17:17,686
{\an1}All right, it's Team 8's final
mission! So let's do this, you
guys!

264
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:18,955
[gasps]

265
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:21,057
<i>(Shino) No.</i>

266
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:25,462
{\an1}This isn't what I've been
looking for. Not at all.

267
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:26,696
What?

268
00:17:27,597 --> 00:17:30,401
{\an1}What I'm looking for instead
is...

269
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:36,440
{\an1}<i>(Shino) What I'm looking for is</i>
<i>to be with my friends who keep</i>

270

<i>the same pace as me.</i>

271
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:43,948

forever.

00:17:44,482 --> 00:17:47,017
{\an1}I have to return to the village
right away.

273
00:17:47,051 --> 00:17:47,451
[gasps]

274
00:17:48,953 --> 00:17:51,422
{\an1}And the reason that I must do so
is because I have to attend the
wedding...

275
00:17:51,455 --> 00:17:53,491
{\an1}of a couple of very important
friends.

276
00:17:53,524 --> 00:17:57,695
{\an1}You actually believe that you
can find your way out of this
fog?!

277
00:17:57,728 --> 00:17:59,997
{\an1}When you're in so much
doubt about your life?!

278
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,632
Yes, I do.

279
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:05,437
{\an1}But to make certain that my
friends can walk their paths
without worry.

280
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,106
{\an1}I'm definitely gonna find my
path in life.

281
00:18:08,507 --> 00:18:10,942
{\an1}And I have no doubt about that
at all!

282
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,152
The entrance!

283
00:18:20,986 --> 00:18:23,788
{\an1}No wait, It's the exit.

284
00:18:28,126 --> 00:18:31,796
{\an1}<i>(Beekeeper) So, you found the</i>
<i>path beyond the guardian deity</i>
<i>of travelers.</i>

285
00:18:32,532 --> 00:18:37,769
{\an1}<i>I see. Then go quickly, before</i>
<i>you lose the path once again.</i>

286
00:18:37,802 --> 00:18:41,240
{\an1}Hold on. You told me that you're
really living life now.

287
00:18:41,274 --> 00:18:44,110
{\an1}But can you actually say that's
the truth?

288
00:18:44,644 --> 00:18:45,745
{\an1}<i>(Beekeeper) What? </i>

289
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:50,551
{\an1}If there's someone stuck in the
past who can't see the future...

290
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:53,219
{\an1}then can it be said that they're
really living?

291
00:18:53,252 --> 00:18:58,224
{\an1}(Shino) I know people who live
every moment striving as hard as
they can to reach their goal.

292
00:18:58,257 --> 00:19:00,494
{\an1}Even when it seems so far out
of reach.

293
00:19:00,993 --> 00:19:05,831
{\an1}People like that are the ones
who are really living life. That
is what I believe.

294
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:09,670
{\an1}<i>(Beekeeper) I'm shocked. You're</i>
<i>nothing like the quiet man I</i>
<i>thought you were.</i>

295
00:19:09,702 --> 00:19:13,106
{\an1}<i>On the inside, you carry a</i>
<i>great deal of passion.</i>

296
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,176
{\an1}<i>I feel like I'm being lectured</i>
<i>by my teacher. </i>

297
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,744
{\an1}Just what does that mean?

298
00:19:18,078 --> 00:19:22,015
{\an1}<i>(Beekeeper) Go now. In time,</i>
<i>perhaps I'll be more like you.</i>

299
00:19:28,121 --> 00:19:33,094
{\an1}Oh, there you are, Shino! Where
have you been?! You just
disappeared all of a sudden!

300
00:19:33,127 --> 00:19:33,661
[agreeing bark]

301
00:19:34,895 --> 00:19:37,665
{\an1}I'm very sorry. However, I did
manage to get ahold of this.

302
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:39,867
{\an1}Whoa! When did you do that?!

303
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:42,904
{\an1}I was sure you were just lost
out there somewhere!

304
00:19:42,937 --> 00:19:46,642
{\an1}Actually, I was lost. But I've
found my way.

305
00:19:46,675 --> 00:19:48,243
It's because...

306
00:19:48,276 --> 00:19:51,614
{\an1}Anyway, let's get this stuff
back home now, Akamaru!

307
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:52,747
[agreeing bark]

308
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,451
{\an1}<i>(Shino) Hey, wait. What about</i>
<i>that girl?</i>

309
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:59,288
{\an1}Huh?! Why are you bringing that
whole thing up again, huh?!

310
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:00,256
I'm sorry.

311
00:20:01,823 --> 00:20:04,426
{\an1}Damn it, I don't know. Maybe
I'll write her a letter or
something like that.

312
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,828
{\an1}<i>(Shino) A letter? How unlike</i>
<i>you!</i>

313
00:20:06,861 --> 00:20:11,667
{\an1}<i>(Kiba) Huh? Why?! There's</i>
<i>nothing wrong with letters!</i>
<i>Right, Akamaru?!</i>

314
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,068
[whines]

315
00:20:13,102 --> 00:20:15,137
{\an1}Akamaru, not you too?!

316
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:18,407
{\an1}[screams] More bugs!

317
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,610
{\an1}That's so amazing!

318
00:20:20,644 --> 00:20:23,380
{\an1}Maybe I'll try to become an
Insect User, too!

319
00:20:23,413 --> 00:20:27,883
{\an1}You know, I'd better get started
on my goal too, or I'll never
become Hokage.

320
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:32,188
{\an1}I think you're wrong. You've
already taken the first step
toward it.

321
00:20:32,222 --> 00:20:33,056
Huh?

322
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:34,291
It's because...

323
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:42,599
{\an1}Putting your goals into words is
the first step toward making
your dreams come true.

324
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:45,969
{\an1}I understand! Thanks for that,
Big Brother!

325
00:20:46,002 --> 00:20:47,037
Let's go!

326
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,105
{\an1}Tsukune, come on!

327
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:50,040
Yeah!

328
00:20:50,073 --> 00:20:52,208
[laughing]

329
00:20:53,076 --> 00:20:55,212
Iruka Sensei!

330
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:58,316
{\an1}Seems you've managed to
completely win over those
difficult kids.

331
00:20:58,349 --> 00:21:00,051
{\an1}Maybe you should become a
teacher!

332
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:01,786
A teacher?

333
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:07,725
{\an1}It's hard even for me to keep up
with mischievous kids like those
guys year after year.

334
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:09,593
{\an1}What you did is quite
impressive.

335
00:21:09,627 --> 00:21:14,332
{\an1}Well, in all honesty, it isn't
that difficult for me. The
reason's because...

336
00:21:14,365 --> 00:21:16,568
{\an1}<i>(Shino) I've always hung</i>
<i>around...</i>

337
00:21:17,301 --> 00:21:20,372
{\an1}With the kids that everyone
calls difficult.

338
00:22:56,037 --> 00:22:58,740
{\an1}<i>(Kakashi) [sighs] The wedding's</i>
<i>coming up soon.</i>

339
00:22:58,773 --> 00:23:01,075
{\an1}<i>(Hinata) What's wrong Kakashi</i>
<i>Sensei?</i>

340
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:05,513
{\an1}<i>(Kakashi) Huh? I was really</i>
<i>happy at first, but when I think</i>
<i>about the upcoming wedding...</i>

341
00:23:05,547 --> 00:23:08,249
{\an1}<i>I haven't finished making the</i>
<i>rounds to greet people...</i>

342
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:12,153
{\an1}<i>I haven't pinned down the</i>
<i>expenses, and I'm worried</i>
<i>if everyone will make it or not!</i>

343
00:23:12,187 --> 00:23:13,789
{\an1}<i>I'm kind of freaking out.</i>

344
00:23:13,823 --> 00:23:15,724
{\an1}<i>(Hinata) Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden:</i>

345
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:20,863
{\an1}<i>"Hidden Leaf Story, The Perfect</i>
<i>Day for a Wedding, Part 6: The</i>
<i>Outcome of the Secret Mission."</i>

346

347
00:23:23,132 --> 00:23:24,400
