[humming]

2
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,190
-Those are called cat tails.

3
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,190
-Huh?

4
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,110
-Why don't you try
squeezing the top?

5
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,070
See?

6
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,110
This is the lake
I told you about.

7
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,010
[humming]

[theme music]

9
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,200
-So it's true.

10
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,110
Lake water doesn't
taste salty at all.

11
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,150
Not like the ocean.

12
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,070
Course, I've never
seen the ocean, either.

13
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,120
Did you--

14
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,000
-Hm?

15
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,110
-There This should
be far enough.

16
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,220
[laughter]

17
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,000
-What's so funny, then?

18
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:17,090
-I have a feeling we're
about to do something fun.

19
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,110
-That's right.

20
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,230
We're about to
have a lot of fun.

21
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,110
Will you put this on for me?

22
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,180
This pill will draw
out your power.

23
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,060
No-- what I mean is it will make
something interesting happen.

24
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:00,170
[groan]

25
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,050
[scream]

26
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,020
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): It's coming.

27
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,140
That was the threshold.

28
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,210
So it's there.

29
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,160
In this lake.

30
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,010
No doubt about it.

31
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,050
Yes.

32
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,020
We can definitely use this
child, Lord Orochimaru.

33
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,150
-You called, Kakashi?

34
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,060
-Thanks for coming, Pakkun.

35
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,200
Take this back to
the village and tell

36
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,931
Lady Tsunade to
have it analyzed.

37
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:11,032
-Huh?

38
00:06:11,032 --> 00:06:13,010
What on earth is it?

39
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,180
-It's a jutsu that was cast
on one of Shino's insects

40
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,170
by a follower of Orochimaru.

41
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,200
We think.

42
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,110
-Orochimaru again?

43
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,000
-From the footprints
they left, we're

44
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,210
looking for five, maybe six.

45
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,090
Anyway, we're going after them.

46
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,020
Get back to the village quickly.

47
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,150
-Leave it to me.

48
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,040
-I know I can count on you.

49
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,040
All right.

50
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,120
Let's get after them,
whoever they are.

51
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,020
But not all together.

52
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,000
We'll spread out,
widen our search area.

53
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,110
We cannot afford to
let them slip through.

54
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
-Right.
[bark]

55
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,000
-Got it.

56
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,160
-No problem at all.

57
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,140
I'll take care of everything
here while you're away.

58
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,140
Don't worry.

59
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,130
-You'd better.

60
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,170
-Could she make
it anymore obvious

61
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,090
that she doesn't trust us?

62
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,060
She doesn't want us finding
out about Orochimaru's hideout,

63
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,140
so she shows us in this dump.

64
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:16,020
-She's extremely cautious,
no doubt about it.

65
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,010
That's why she doesn't
make that many mistakes.

66
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,010
And that's also why
we can trust her.

67
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,010
-Yeah, but those
poor slobs she killed

68
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,040
were running away because they
didn't want to see Orochimaru.

69
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,030
Are you sure we can trust her?

70
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,190
GAMARIKI: 1, 2, 1, 2.

71
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,060
NARUTO: 1, 2, 1, 2.

72
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,040
-It's perfect, Naruto.

73
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,060
Gamariki's stern discipline
will soon harden and temper you

74
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,150
like a steel blade.

75
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,150
And then you'll--

76
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,060
[giggling]

77
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,060
-And then your body and
spirit will be tough enough

78
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,050
to resist the temptations
of the world, and-- ah!

79
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,140
I hope to be able to
resist them too, someday.

80
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:04,030
-What You can't even learn a
simple little move like that?

81
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,020
-Hey, it's not me!

82
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,040
I can learn it fine!

83
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,110
You just don't know how
to teach it, that's all!

84
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,060
-I get it.

85
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,130
It's me.

86
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,100
I suppose you could do better?

87
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,050
-Just forget it.

88
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,150
I've had enough of this.

89
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,140
I quit.

90
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,220
-Well, we'll just
see about that.

91
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,220
Love tap!

92
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,230
-Hittin' me from behind, huh?

93
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,080
You cowardly toad!

94
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,070
-No-- just-- get off me!

95
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,180
[screaming]

96
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,120
[shouting]

00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,110
WOMAN: Oh, my goodness!

98
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,200
WOMAN: What happened
to the water?

99
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,050
WOMAN: Let's get out of here.

100
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,110
-No!

101
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,170
-You call that training,
slobbering all over me

102
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,210
like that?

103
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,090
-It's not slobbering,
it's a love tap, you--

104
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,190
-I don't care what you call
it, this partnership is over!

105
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,080
-Well, that suits me fine.

106
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,180
-That is enough, both of you!

107
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,040
Knock it off!

108
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,010
-Hm?

109
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,170
-Coming from Naruto,
I'm not surprised.

110
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,000
But you too, Gamariki?

111
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,180
I must say, I'm
very disappointed.

112
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,190
-Forgive me.

113
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,070
I really do understand, Jiraiya.

114
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,080
Really, I do.

115
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,160
It's this boy.

116
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,170
He's--

117
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,170
-This collaboration
ninjutsu will never

118
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,080
work unless the two of you
get your hearts and bodies

119
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,040
working in perfect sync.

120
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,120
-Exactly.

121
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,120
But in order to achieve that,
we have to be, uh-- well, compatible.

122
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,110
-Yeah!

123
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,210
And we're not compatible.

124
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,160
And things will go
a lot faster if you

125
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,220
let me find somebody
I am compatible with.

126
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,050
-Heh.

127
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,100
That may not be such a bad idea.

128
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,080
There's just one problem.

129
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,230
How can you summon anything
with that arm of yours?

130
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,080
-Heh.

131
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,040
You're forgetting how fast
my body can heal, Pervy Sage.

132
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,230
See what I mean?

133
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,081
-Hm?

134
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,010
-Summoning Jutsu!

135
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,190
What the wha--

136
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,190
-Long time no see, pal.

137
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,090
-Hey, Naruto.

138
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,930
How's it goin'?

139
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,470
-Gamakichi?

140
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,371
Tatu?

141
00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:14,111
Wha--

142
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:15,000
-Well, Well.

143
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,140
You two sure have grown.

144
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,100
-Yeah.

145
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,170
I almost didn't recognize you.

146
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,130
You've gotten a lot bigger.

147
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,010
-Of course we have.

148
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,120
-It's on account of we
both ate a lot of snacks.

149
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,190
-So anyway, Naruto, what
did you summon us for?

150
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,110
-Right.

151
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,190
Here's the plan.

152
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,040
How do you feel about
perfecting our synchronicity

153
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,210
and compatibility?

154
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,180
-Huh?

155
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,130
-What's that?

156
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,090
Does it taste good?

157
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,060
GUREN (VOICEOVER):
Lord Orochimaru.

158
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,071
That's--

159
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,220
-You're late, Guren.

160
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:29,090
Lord Orochimaru has
chosen Gen'yumaru.

161
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,110
And that was Sasuke
Uchiha just now.

162
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,150
Lord Orochimaru's next vessel.

163
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:56,080
-So, Sasuke, let's see how
your training's coming.

164
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,180
Show me all that you've learned.

165
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,130
-You're going to be my opponent?

166
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,040
-Course not.

167
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,000
Very impressive.

168
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,160
You stand there facing
a thousand opponents

169
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,120
without batting an eye.

170
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,080
GUREN (VOICEOVER): That
man-- how strong could he be?

171
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,070
-Let it begin.

172
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,170
Yes, Sasuke.

173
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,030
You truly are the one.

174
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,140
-What is it?

175
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:47,010
His power-- I've
never seen such--

176
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,110
-OK, then.

177
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,200
But I gotta warn
you, we're going

178
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,210
to really put you
through your paces.

179
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,090
-Yeah.

180
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,170
You do that.

181
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,030
-And a one, and a two.

182
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,050
Hit it.

183
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,020
(SINGING) Can you
hear the froggy song?

184
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,100
Yes, I hear the froggy song.

185
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,160
Can you hear the froggy--

186
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,120
-Hey, wait a minute.

187
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,210
What are you guys doing?

188
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:18,020
-Yes, I hear it and I
see yummy fly to eat.

189
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,060
-Heh, heh.

190
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,190
Boing, boing, boing,
boing, boing, boing, boing.

191
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,030
-Gotcha!

192
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,020
Boing.

193
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,130
-Get with the program.

194
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,170
You're not trying to connect
to his heart and soul, Naruto.

195
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,180
-Come on!

196
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,200
This can't really
be part of training.

197
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,210
[sigh]

198
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:38,130
-When will you
ever learn, Naruto?

199
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,020
-Did I get 'em all?

200
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,210
-You defeated them all
without one fatal blow.

201
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,220
You are still naive.

202
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,180
-They're not the
ones I want to kill.

203
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,070
-You must learn to be heartless,
or you'll never defeat Itachi.

204
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,050
-When I come face
to face with him,

205
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,230
I'll be heartless, all right.

206
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,210
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
Not a drop of blood on him.

207
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,050
They called me a genius,
but compared to him,

208
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,150
there's no comparison.

209
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,080
Just a little longer.

210
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,070
A little more patience--
and he's mine.

211
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,150
-It's been a long time, Guren.

212
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,200
I'm so glad you've come.

213
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,010
Yes.

214
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,090
That young man is destined
to be my next vessel.

215
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,050
You still want to be my
vessel yourself, don't you?

216
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,080
You haven't given
up on that dream.

217
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,120
Your skills are
indeed very enticing.

218
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,180
I was so impressed
when we first met.

219
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:13,170
GUREN (VOICEOVER): Lord
Orochimaru-- you're wrong.

220
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:36,020
-These powers of yours,
they intrigue me.

221
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,040
Come with me, child.

222
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,000
GUREN (VOICEOVER): You're wrong.

223
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,110
I was the one who was impressed.

224
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,100
By you.

225
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,090
Your power.

226
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,150
I wanted nothing more
thing than to be like you.

227
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,060
-And now for the reason
I summoned you here.

228
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,000
I have something special I
need you to do for me, Guren.

229
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,060
-Anything.

230
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,070
You know I live only to
serve you, Lord Orochimaru.

231
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,220
-Call it a mission.

232
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,080
A mission that would benefit
from your unique talents.

233
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:22,200
In fact, you're the only one
who could possibly do it.

234
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,040
-I'm the only one?

235
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,110
-And afterwards, who knows?

236
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,150
I might even reconsider.

237
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:36,080
I might change my mind about who
is best suited to be my vessel.

238
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,000
KABUTO (VOICEOVER):
He's getting tired.

239
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,220
Perhaps we should
rest for a bit.

240
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,180
[giggling]

241
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,230
-What a joke.

242
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,180
Trying to keep up with a
bunch of stupid dance moves.

243
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,050
It's embarrassing.

244
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,140
Trying to connect heart and
soul is crazy, especially

245
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,000
with a toad.

246
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,120
CHILD: Can you really do that?

247
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,071
-Huh?

248
00:17:30,071 --> 00:17:30,810
Hey?

249
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,100
Who said that?
Who's there?

250
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,080
-Where'd you come from?

251
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,160
-What does that mean, to
connect heart and soul?

252
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,120
-Uh, well, uh, it's
when you can feel

253
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,170
what someone else is feeling,
and they feel what you feel.

254
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,110
-Can anyone connect like that?

255
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,100
-Well, yeah, I suppose.

256
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,060
Hm.

257
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,070
If you stay focused
and keep working

258
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,070
at it, one day-- one
day it has to work.

259
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,110
And then even Sasuke-- 'cause
wherever someone is still

260
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,190
thinking of you, that
place is your home.

261
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,300
But you wouldn't know what
I'm talking about, would you?

262
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,040
Sorry.

263
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,160
I was kind of rambling.

264
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,010
-So if somebody somewhere is
thinking about me, wherever

265
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,210
that person is is
where I belong.

266
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,030
-That's right.

267
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,090
Wherever it is,
that place is home.

268
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,180
-I've learned something.

269
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,090
-Yeah, I know lots of stuff.

270
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:33,010
[laughter]

271
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,220
-So tell me, what's
your name, anyway?

272
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,230
Huh?

273
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,170
Weird kid.

274
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,220
Where'd he disappear to?

275
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,000
-Kakashi-sensei, is
this really the right

276
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,220
time for us to be kicking
back and taking it easy?

277
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,090
-We can't do anything until
my insects locate the enemy.

278
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,020
We might as well rest up.

279
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,050
-He's right, Kiba

280
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,140
-Yeah.

281
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,130
Until we find out exactly who
they are and where they are,

282
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,200
there's no sense in
us jumping the gun.

283
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,180
Besides, there's
that crystal jutsu.

284
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,080
Until Pakkun gets back with
word from the Hidden Leaf,

285
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,160
we've got to move with caution.

286
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,050
[knocking]

287
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,220
-Enter.

288
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,040
-Lady Tsunade, Kakashi
sent us a messenger.

289
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,020
-Well, well.

290
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,080
Pakkun.

291
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,030
-Before I give you
Kakashi's message,

292
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,150
do you think I could
have some water?

293
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,210
-Feels good.

294
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,000
Nice and hot.

295
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,890
-Huh?

296
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,130
What the-- you
shrunk, Gamakichi.

297
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,180
What happened to you?

298
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,000
-Of course I shrunk.

299
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,230
If I hopped in here
full sized, there

300
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,230
wouldn't be room
left for anyone else.

301
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,080
I used ninjutsu to
make myself small.

302
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,220
-Really?

303
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,020
Whoa, that's a
pretty cool ninju--

304
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,080
-Nothing like a hot
bath, is there, brother?

305
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,060
Especially after a
hard day of training.

306
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,160
-Please, you call that training?

307
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,080
All you guys did was
chase flies all day.

308
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,070
-No.

309
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,160
We were working
on the foundations

310
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
of the collaboration ninjutsu.

311
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,000
-Get out of here.

312
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,060
You really expect me to copy
those wacky moves of yours?

313
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,100
-Who said anything
about copying?

314
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,040
This training's about
learning to feel

315
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:29,100
what's in Gamatatsu's heart,
and how to respond to it.

316
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,120
-Gamatatsu?

317
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
-This feels so nice.

318
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,070
-Forget about copying
his every move exactly.

319
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,090
Feeling what's in your partner's
heart, feeling it in yours,

320
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,160
that's the essence
of collaboration.

321
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,090
That's how you get two
beings in perfect sync.

322
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,170
-Your partner's heart.

323
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,010
Feeling it.

324
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,120
Now I see.

325
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,160
I get it.

326
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,220
Yeah, I finally get it.

327
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,080
Let me try one more time.

328
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,650
I'll master this collaboration

-Yay!

330
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,090
I love training.

00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,010
-Huh?

332
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,000
Oh, no!

Wait!

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,010
-My tummy hurts.

-Ah, yes.

00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,000
The sweet voices of
bathing beauties.

-All the bathing
beauties just left.

GAMAKICHI: Naruto,
you'll never get it

345
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,230
if you keep getting
distracted by what you see.

346
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,200
GAMATATSU: I'm hungry.

GAMAKICHI: Don't focus
so much on his moves,

350
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,070
but where they're coming from.

I'm trying to do!

GAMAKICHI: Try and feel
Gamatatsu's emotional vibes,

355
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,140
then channel them
through your own style.

NARUTO: Will you shut
up for a second, please?

357
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,200
Think I'm finally on
to something here.
