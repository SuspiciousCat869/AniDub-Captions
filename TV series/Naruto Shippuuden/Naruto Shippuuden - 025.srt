1
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:23,423
-[grunt]

2
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,822
-Lady Chiyo.

3
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,324
SASORI (VOICEOVER):
What's going on?

4
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,698
How is she still moving?

5
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:12,539
Is the old bag still
controlling her?

6
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,007
No.

7
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,477
She couldn't generate such
complicated movements.

8
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,947
Not in her condition.

9
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,785
Somehow that girl is
moving on her own.

10
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,219
But how?

11
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:30,090
I know my poison affected her.

12
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:33,527
-Sakura, how can you be--

13
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,828
-I used the antidote.

14
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:35,862
Thank goodness it worked.

15
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,403
-An Antidote?

16
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,772
But when did you get that?

17
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,908
-The same time I made
the antidote for Kankuro

18
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,076
in the Hidden Sand Village.

19
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,216
SAKURA: I never imagined
I'd find such a wide variety

20
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:59,586
of medicinal herbs here
in the Hidden Sand.

21
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,154
-Well, we try.

22
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,857
Our soil's not very well
suited to growing them.

23
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,060
We can't grow much scurvy
grass, for example.

24
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,730
SAKURA: That's all
right, there's enough.

25
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:13,767
I can make three
doses of antidote.

26
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,902
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): I was
barely able to make three.

27
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,938
I gave one of them to
Kankuro to heal him.

28
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,606
-That's right, drink it all.

29
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,879
-[gasp] [coughs]

30
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,415
-There, you should
be all right now.

31
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,616
Just lie back and rest.

32
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,087
And don't move around
'till the numbness passes.

33
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,323
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): I knew
our adversary used poison,

34
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,625
so I brought the rest with
me in hypodermic form.

35
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,863
-Of course.

36
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,231
And that's how you--

37
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,165
-Yes.

38
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,968
I used one of the
doses on myself.

39
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:53,106
Catch is, the antidote is only
potent for about three minutes.

40
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,008
While it's working,
whatever poison

41
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:57,511
you're exposed to gets
converted into harmless protein.

42
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,150
-I understand.

43
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,152
-That's why I didn't
try to fight back.

44
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:09,890
I didn't want Sasori to
know I had this antidote.

45
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,793
I knew he'd reveal his plan
once he let his guard down.

46
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,095
I had to take the chance.

47
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,631
So I waited until the
last possible moment.

48
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:26,707
This is it.

49
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,910
There's only one dose left.

50
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,579
Here, I want to keep
this with you Lady Chiyo.

51
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:33,480
-Hm.

52
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,247
[gasp]

53
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:34,848
-What's wrong?

54
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,549
Are you OK?

55
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,887
SASORI (VOICEOVER):
Wait a second,

56
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:44,858
there's no way the
poison was neutralized.

57
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,259
-[gasp]

58
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:49,863
-I'll just let the
poison take Its course.

59
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,698
You'll wish I hadn't.

60
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,968
Your suffering will
be unimaginable.

61
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:59,973
But it will be over in
less than three days.

62
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,374
SASORI (VOICEOVER):
Don't tell me

63
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,811
they analyzed the poison
I used in that fight.

64
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,279
Impossible.

65
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,482
Even if they were
somehow able to isolate

66
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:11,218
the individual
components, they wouldn't

67
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:15,088
be able to prepare an
antidote that easily.

68
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:18,291
The antidote is prohibitively
difficult to mix.

69
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,660
If there's even the
slightest mistake--

70
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,864
Even I needed to reference
the mix ratio table,

71
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,732
and I created it.

72
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,000
-Don't worry, I'll heal you.

73
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,748
For the next three minutes or
so, his poison won't effect me.

74
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,417
Which means we don't have a
lot of time to finish this.

75
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:44,918
-Right.

76
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,960
SASORI (VOICEOVER):
Did the witch do this?

77
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,428
No.

78
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:59,166
I've got more medical skill
than anyone in the Sand Village.

79
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,635
Certainly more
than the old lady.

80
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,136
There's no way she
could have cracked

81
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,271
a poison this intricate.

82
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,177
Hmph.

83
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,146
Isn't this kid a
medical ninja too?

84
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,583
And if memory serves, she's
from the Leave Village.

85
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,456
The Leaf's current
Hokage is Tsunade,

86
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,059
and she's known as a
world-class medical ninja.

87
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,566
That's it.

88
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:33,600
She made the antidote.

89
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:40,006
[theme music]

90
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:32,452
-Thank you.

91
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,554
My had feels fine now, Sakura.

92
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,022
-Oh?

93
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:36,523
Good.

94
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,464
[heavy breathing]

95
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,373
[yell]

96
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:02,615
CHIYO (VOICEOVER):
Powerful attacks, evasion,

97
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,084
healing wounds.

98
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:20,200
All of that must use a
considerable amount of chakra.

99
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:29,275
Her body has probably
already reached its limit.

100
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,255
-So annoying.

101
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,990
This is taking so
long, I'll never

102
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,694
get back to my man, Sasori.

103
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:51,197
I know, I'll use the rest
of my detonating clay,

104
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:54,467
and show him what a
real artist can do.

105
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,436
However, if I'm
going to do that,

106
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,873
I'll have to get rid of
the copy ninja first.

107
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:03,810
It might have taken awhile,
but this is worth the wait.

108
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:13,686
-[grunt]

109
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,132
-What?

110
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,435
These aren't like the
bird ones from before.

111
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,903
They're smaller.

112
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:33,807
Is that so they won't get
picked off by shuriken?

113
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,876
Why so many?

114
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,113
Judging from the size
of their hind legs,

115
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:43,516
I'd say their special
ability is jumping.

116
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,952
And I guess it's going to come
down to a battle of speed.

117
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,169
Naruto, wait up!

118
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,572
-You're slowing me
down Kakashi-Sensei,

119
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,307
I'm going on ahead.

120
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,309
-Don't do anything reckless.

121
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,679
-Yeah, yeah I know.

122
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,582
--[sigh] This might be a
bit of a sticky situation.

123
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,289
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): I staunched
the major bleeding anyway.

124
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:30,997
Time to refocus the rest
of my chakra to attack.

125
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,099
We've only got three
minutes to do this.

126
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,610
CHIYO (VOICEOVER):
Three minutes,

127
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,746
or we won't have another chance.

128
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,248
-We're running low on time.

129
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:51,317
Are you healed enough
for a fight Lady Chiyo?

130
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,919
-Let's go, Sakura.

131
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,324
It's time we put an end to this.

132
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:09,930
-Got to think.

133
00:11:09,964 --> 00:11:12,767
I can't waste time
having a staring contest

134
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,769
with these things.

135
00:11:14,802 --> 00:11:17,271
If I leave Naruto on his
own, he could lose control

136
00:11:17,304 --> 00:11:18,205
at any moment.

137
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,118
They won't put me
fall back and build up

138
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:33,154
enough speed to break past them.

139
00:11:33,187 --> 00:11:35,956
They're maintaining
this distance.

140
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:46,000
In that case-- Come on, guys.

141
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,205
In that case-- Come on, guys.

142
00:11:51,238 --> 00:11:52,907
Stay right on my tail.

143
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:02,783
There they go.

144
00:12:09,223 --> 00:12:10,157
Huh? [gasp]

145
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:22,436
-That takes care of him.

146
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,270
Hmph.

147
00:12:23,304 --> 00:12:25,005
-That wasn't-- Kakashi-Sensei.

148
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:31,512
-At last.

149
00:12:31,545 --> 00:12:33,814
Now it's just the two of us.

150
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:35,516
-[growl]

151
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:38,018
-Aw, don't scowl like that.

152
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:40,321
And here I was about to
let you see your friend.

153
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:46,694
-[growl]

154
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:49,597
-Oh that's right,
you're a Jinchuriki too.

155
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,700
I bet seeing him like
this drives you crazy.

156
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:56,036
-Give him back right now!

157
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,105
-Don't do it.

158
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,073
NARUTO: Kakashi-Sensei.

159
00:13:02,109 --> 00:13:03,444
-Aw, man.

160
00:13:03,477 --> 00:13:07,615
I could've sworn you just
bought it back there.

161
00:13:07,648 --> 00:13:08,682
-Sorry.

162
00:13:08,716 --> 00:13:10,885
But it wasn't the
real me that blew up.

163
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:32,306
Next time you should
teach your critters

164
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,944
to tell the difference between
a real human and a shadow clone.

165
00:13:36,977 --> 00:13:41,982
That is, if there
is a next time.

166
00:13:42,016 --> 00:13:43,117
-Don't move!

167
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,220
-I could say the same to you.

168
00:13:46,253 --> 00:13:47,421
It'll be all right.

169
00:13:47,454 --> 00:13:49,490
We will get Gaara back.

170
00:13:49,523 --> 00:13:50,691
So calm down.

171
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,099
-My man Sasori is
going to yell at me

172
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:02,303
again for not being prepared.

173
00:14:02,336 --> 00:14:03,470
What can I say?

174
00:14:03,504 --> 00:14:05,973
Planning out every little
insignificant detail

175
00:14:06,006 --> 00:14:08,909
ahead of time just
isn't my style.

176
00:14:08,943 --> 00:14:11,212
I prefer to stay
flexible dealing

177
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:13,681
with unexpected situation.

178
00:14:13,714 --> 00:14:16,350
Developing that kind of
sophisticated mindset

179
00:14:16,383 --> 00:14:19,787
is the mark of a true artist.

180
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:24,024
Let's see, what to do now.

181
00:14:24,058 --> 00:14:27,061
-Listen Naruto, you're not
used to fighting an opponent

182
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:27,928
like this.

183
00:14:27,962 --> 00:14:29,363
And that's not all.

184
00:14:29,396 --> 00:14:33,234
You're a close combat fighter,
he excels at long range.

185
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:37,304
That makes him your worst enemy.

186
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:42,142
There are only two ways
to beat this kind of foe.

187
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:47,047
One is to force him to
fight up close and personal.

188
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:51,986
Your only other option is
to beat him at his own game.

189
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:53,120
-What?

190
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:55,022
How can we do that?

191
00:14:55,055 --> 00:14:57,424
-Depending on which
strategy is chosen,

192
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,927
you'd either need a
long range specialist,

193
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,129
or someone on your
team who can use long

194
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:07,234
range ninjutsu to support
that kind of distance combat.

195
00:15:07,268 --> 00:15:09,303
If you don't have
one or the other,

196
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:11,939
then there's no way
you'll beat him, period.

197
00:15:14,475 --> 00:15:17,311
Now if you had the superior
intellect of Shikamaru,

198
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:18,646
that would be a different story.

199
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,414
-Spell it out, will you?

200
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:22,449
Which one are you,
Kakashi-Sensei?

201
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:23,717
-Ah.

202
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:25,753
Me, huh?

203
00:15:25,786 --> 00:15:29,790
Well I have a superior intellect
like Shikamaru, I'm a Jonin,

204
00:15:29,823 --> 00:15:32,493
and I can sustain
long range battle.

205
00:15:32,526 --> 00:15:34,361
-Then we meet all the
conditions, right?

206
00:15:34,395 --> 00:15:36,430
-That's why I told
you to calm down.

207
00:15:36,463 --> 00:15:38,299
-Well let's hurry
up and get to it!

208
00:15:38,332 --> 00:15:41,835
-It's not as simple
as it sounds.

209
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:44,171
We can't just chase after him.

210
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:47,574
He'll never leave himself open.

211
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:49,410
-Now you're within range.

212
00:15:57,451 --> 00:16:00,154
-[gasp]

213
00:16:00,187 --> 00:16:01,155
-[chuckle]

214
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:13,467
-Well my mission is to clear.

215
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:20,040
-He infiltrated the
Hidden Sand Village

216
00:16:20,074 --> 00:16:22,976
and defeated Gaara
all by himself.

217
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:28,382
And even more dangerous, he's
a member of the Akatsuki.

218
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,885
-Well, I suppose I shouldn't
go easy on them, huh?

219
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,122
-It's a tough challenge.

220
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:38,959
All we can do is try and
punch hole in his defenses.

221
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:40,494
We're going to have
to work together.

222
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:49,103
If you were following
my train of thought,

223
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:51,672
then keep listening.

224
00:16:51,705 --> 00:16:52,639
I've got a plan.

225
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:15,596
-OK Sakura, Let's get him.

226
00:17:15,629 --> 00:17:17,598
-Right.

227
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:18,899
SASORI (VOICEOVER): Hmph.

228
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:24,738
Fine, I'll admit it, she's
more impressive than I thought.

229
00:17:24,772 --> 00:17:29,410
Never thought I'd see the
Third Kazekage destroyed.

230
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:35,149
And it's probably a waste
to use other human puppets.

231
00:17:35,182 --> 00:17:37,584
-I haven't been forced to
solve a problem this way

232
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:39,920
since I joined the Akatsuki.

233
00:17:39,953 --> 00:17:41,789
I wonder how long it's been.

234
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:44,291
-[gasp] Wh-- What is that?

235
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:48,462
-Now I see.

236
00:17:48,495 --> 00:17:52,399
The reason he looks exactly
the same as the day he left.

237
00:17:55,269 --> 00:17:57,604
Of course age
doesn't affect him.

238
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:06,547
The reason is staring
us right in the face.

239
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,815
-Oh, yes.

240
00:18:07,848 --> 00:18:11,718
It's been awhile indeed
since I last used myself.

241
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:20,527
-He's actually a human puppet.

242
00:18:39,947 --> 00:18:40,914
-You all set?

243
00:18:40,948 --> 00:18:42,149
-Yeah, I got it.

244
00:18:42,182 --> 00:18:43,951
Don't worry.

245
00:18:43,984 --> 00:18:45,419
-Here we go.

246
00:18:57,397 --> 00:18:58,365
-Hm?

247
00:18:58,398 --> 00:18:59,366
What the--

248
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:16,984
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Hold on,
if his entire body is a puppet,

249
00:19:17,017 --> 00:19:19,753
then that means all of the
weapons hidden inside his body

250
00:19:19,786 --> 00:19:23,423
are covered with
that poison as well.

251
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:26,393
-Something wrong?

252
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:28,529
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): It's
already been over a minute

253
00:19:28,562 --> 00:19:31,365
since I gave myself
the antidote.

254
00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:34,635
-I'm sorry, weren't you
supposed to finish me off?

255
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:41,408
Well if you aren't
going to attack me--

256
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:43,377
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): The
effects of the antidote

257
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,512
will wear off in less
than two minutes.

258
00:19:45,546 --> 00:19:48,382
That's all I've got.

259
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:51,585
Somehow I have to draw him into
close combat and defeat him.

260
00:19:51,618 --> 00:19:55,055
And I've got to do it fast.

261
00:19:55,088 --> 00:19:57,524
-Then I'll have to
make the first move.

262
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,499
You think you can hide from me?

263
00:20:21,014 --> 00:20:26,620
Well, what are you
going to do now?

264
00:20:28,655 --> 00:20:32,092
[theme music]

265
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:01,408
ANTIQUES HOST (VOICEOVER): And
now, time for Antique Ninja

266
00:22:01,441 --> 00:22:02,609
Treasure.

267
00:22:02,643 --> 00:22:04,278
Today, Lady Chiyo has
brought us a unique item.

268
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:06,747
CHIYO (VOICEOVER): It's one of
the First Puppeteer Monzaemon

269
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,981
finest works.

270
00:22:08,015 --> 00:22:09,449
ANTIQUES EXPERT (VOICEOVER):
If this is genuine,

271
00:22:09,483 --> 00:22:11,285
it's a historical find.

272
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,753
CHIYO (VOICEOVER):
No ifs about it.

273
00:22:12,786 --> 00:22:13,554
ANTIQUES HOST
(VOICEOVER): And what

274
00:22:13,587 --> 00:22:14,354
does the owner think it's worth?

275
00:22:14,388 --> 00:22:15,055
CHIYO (VOICEOVER): Worth?

276
00:22:15,088 --> 00:22:16,390
Please, it's priceless.

277
00:22:16,423 --> 00:22:18,058
ANTIQUES HOST (VOICEOVER):
OK, and what about our expert?

278
00:22:18,091 --> 00:22:19,760
ANTIQUES EXPERT (VOICEOVER):
Well, it is a truly fine work.

279
00:22:19,793 --> 00:22:20,527
ANTIQUES HOST
(VOICEOVER): Oh, looks

280
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:21,528
like they made a decision.

281
00:22:21,562 --> 00:22:22,930
Open the bidding!

282
00:22:22,963 --> 00:22:25,766
BIDDERS (VOICEOVER): 1,
10, 100, 1,000, 10,000.

283
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:35,842
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next time,
Puppet Fight, 10 Versus 100.

284
00:22:35,842 --> 00:22:43,183
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next time,
Puppet Fight, 10 Versus 100.

285
00:22:43,216 --> 00:22:44,818
-Hey, Sasori my man?

286
00:22:44,851 --> 00:22:46,153
-Yeah?

287
00:22:46,186 --> 00:22:49,389
-I was wondering, why did
Orochimaru leave the Akatsuki?

288
00:22:49,423 --> 00:22:51,625
-Well Itachi ditched him.

289
00:22:51,658 --> 00:22:52,292
-Hm?

290
00:22:52,326 --> 00:22:53,961
What does that mean?

291
00:22:53,994 --> 00:22:56,964
-Orochimaru developed
a re-animation jutsu.

292
00:22:56,997 --> 00:23:00,634
He takes over people's body
so he can live forever.

293
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:02,402
The story goes, he
tried to use the jutsu

294
00:23:02,436 --> 00:23:05,505
to take over Itachi's
body, but he failed.

295
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:06,573
-Really?

296
00:23:06,607 --> 00:23:09,009
-Since then, Orochimaru
has been switching

297
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:11,211
the younger and
stronger bodies, one

298
00:23:11,244 --> 00:23:13,880
after another, trying
to live forever.

299
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:14,748
-Ha.

300
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:16,016
That's stupid.

301
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:17,250
-Hm?

302
00:23:17,284 --> 00:23:21,888
-Transient beauty that's
gone in the blink of an eye.

303
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:23,824
Now that is truly valuable.

304
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,829
-What's the point
of having anything

305
00:23:28,862 --> 00:23:31,898
that's gone so quickly?

306
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:34,368
What's valuable is having
something that never wears

307
00:23:34,401 --> 00:23:37,404
away, that lasts
for an eternity.
