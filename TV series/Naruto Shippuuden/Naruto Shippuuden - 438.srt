00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:12,508
Well, um...

148
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:17,748
{\an4}I was able to see with my
Byakugan that the two of you
were being attacked and
pursued by somebody...

149
00:11:17,782 --> 00:11:22,956
{\an1}The thing is... as soon as
we got here, all sign of
them disappeared.

150
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,058
Disappeared?

151
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:27,328
Yes... as if a fox
spirited them away.

152
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:30,901
{\an1}And where's Neji?
Is he...?

153
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:36,743
{\an1}Oh, uh...  Naruto fell into the
enemy's trap, and then Neji fell
in when he went after him.

154
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:38,545
{\an1}Naruto, too!?

155
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:42,151
Hold on...  I
know that scent.

156
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:44,922
{\an1}Sasuke and Sakura should
be nearby here, too!

157
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,290
Byakugan!

158
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:56,637
{\an1}We have to hurry! There's a
shadowy figure that's
approaching them...

159
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:59,209
{\an1}...but they seem unaware of it!

160
00:12:13,229 --> 00:12:19,738
{\an1}Big brother, You made me a
promise! I mean, you <i>are</i> going
to help me train today, right?

161
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,075
{\an1}I'm sorry, Sasuke.

162
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:26,114
{\an1}But Lord Fourth has just sent
a summons asking for me.

163
00:12:26,148 --> 00:12:30,319
{\an1}Aw, come on, don't go!  I was
really looking forward to having
you help me, Big Brother!

164
00:12:30,353 --> 00:12:32,924
{\an1}Some other time, OK?

165
00:12:32,957 --> 00:12:35,094
{\an1}Why don't you ask
Father to teach you?

166
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:37,296
But...

167
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:52,518
{\an1}Whoaaa!

168
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:57,927
{\an1}Now, this is the key jutsu
of our clan, Fire Style:
Fire Ball Jutsu.

169
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,597
{\an1}I've already shown you
the hand signs...

170
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:05,271
{\an1}The next step is to build up
your Chakra and focus it at a
point in your chest,

171
00:13:05,305 --> 00:13:08,042
{\an1}...then force it up the throat
and out the mouth.

172
00:13:08,075 --> 00:13:09,743
{\an1}All right!

173
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:16,820
{\an8}<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>Father's actually teaching me</i>
<i>the jutsu himself..! </i>

174
00:13:16,854 --> 00:13:21,261
{\an7}<i>He's finally giving me a chance</i>
<i>to show that I matter too... </i>

175
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:23,797
{\an7}<i>I can't disappoint him.</i>

176
00:13:28,338 --> 00:13:30,607
{\an8}<i>I can do it!</i>

177
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:36,949
{\an7}<i>Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!</i>

178
00:13:44,227 --> 00:13:47,899
{\an1}[groan] Why did I think you
would be like Itatchi?

179
00:13:51,838 --> 00:13:54,708
{\an1}It's too soon. You're
not ready yet.

180
00:14:06,326 --> 00:14:08,362
{\an1}Sakura...!

181
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:16,340
{\an1}I know. I wasn't able to
inflict a fatal hit with
my attack before!

182
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:23,050
{\an1}There is a limit to life...
But art... is forever!

183
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:27,890
{\an1}Do you want to see my
everlasting army?

184
00:14:27,923 --> 00:14:33,597
{\an1}Each one is a truly valuable
work of art that surpasses life.

185
00:14:34,232 --> 00:14:38,906
{\an1}Secret Red Move: Performance
of a Hundred Puppets

186
00:14:45,148 --> 00:14:48,619
{\an1}One hundred puppets...?!
How can we...?!

187
00:14:56,865 --> 00:14:58,901
There's just no end
to all of them!

188
00:14:58,935 --> 00:15:01,472
This is impossible!

189
00:15:01,504 --> 00:15:04,209
So... what now?

190
00:15:04,242 --> 00:15:11,420
{\an1}Will you fight each of my
hundred pieces of art?  Or will
you just cower in fear?

191
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:14,824
{\an1}The choice is yours to make.

192
00:15:21,401 --> 00:15:25,140
{\an7}<i>He said he was the</i>
<i>gatekeeper... If thats true...</i>

193
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:30,080
{\an7}<i>These things are here to prevent</i>
<i>us from returning to the Hidden</i>
<i>Leaf Village.</i>

194
00:15:30,113 --> 00:15:35,454
{\an7}<i>Which means... as long as we</i>
<i>don't try to pass them, they</i>
<i>won't attack.</i>

195
00:15:35,487 --> 00:15:40,895
{\an7}<i>But... can Sakura and I really</i>
<i>take on a hundred puppets and</i>
<i>make it through?</i>

196
00:15:41,763 --> 00:15:44,567
{\an7}<i>That's gotta be close to</i>
<i>impossible for anyone!</i>

197
00:15:45,101 --> 00:15:48,706
{\an7}<i>Although, with more on our</i>
<i>side...</i>

198
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,642
[bark barl]

199
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,678
Everyone!

200
00:15:54,248 --> 00:15:57,352
{\an7}<i>Finally, we're able to</i>
<i>rendezvous!</i>

201
00:16:01,091 --> 00:16:04,763
Let's hide
our presence
for a while...

202
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,936
[gasp]

203
00:16:14,743 --> 00:16:21,554
{\an1}What exactly is going on?!

204
00:16:21,588 --> 00:16:23,591
{\an1}Are they puppets?

205
00:16:23,623 --> 00:16:26,862
{\an1}Yeah. And there's a
hundred of them.

206
00:16:26,895 --> 00:16:32,035
{\an1}And on our side... There are ten
including me... plus a dog.

207
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:34,607
What's happening
here, anyway?

208
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,447
{\an1}A puppet user put all of these
things out there to create a
blockade.

209
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,184
A blockade? Where's
the puppet user?

210
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:44,487
<i>(Sasuke)</i>
<i>Watching to see our next move.</i>

211
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:47,525
Sasuke, what was
your initial plan?

212
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:51,230
{\an1}Well, if we want Lord
Fourth to be able to
conduct a rescue mission,

213
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:54,101
{\an1}we have to return to the
village and report to him.

214
00:16:54,134 --> 00:16:58,040
{\an1}But if we just bring down
all one hundred puppets now,
we can get out of here.

215
00:16:58,073 --> 00:16:59,909
You sure do
make it sound easy!

216
00:16:59,942 --> 00:17:02,413
{\an1}Still, it's not
impossible, is it?

217
00:17:02,446 --> 00:17:06,852
{\an1}If we're going to complete our
mission, we really don't have
another choice.

218
00:17:06,885 --> 00:17:09,557
{\an1}Hey, hold up!  We don't wanna go
back to the village yet!

219
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,662
{\an1}We're not just gonna give up on
rescuing the team captains!

220
00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:15,164
So you plan on
abandoning the mission?

221
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:20,206
{\an4}No, that's not it.  The reason
is because there's also the
option of breaking up into two
teams:

222
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:23,611
{\an1}one to look for the captains
and one to report back to
the village.

223
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:28,917
{\an1}No way.  I also think it's a
better idea if we stick together
and work as one united team.

224
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:31,522
{\an1}What? Shikamaru! What the
hell are you talking about?!

225
00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:35,727
{\an1}Yeah, I know!  In the beginning,
I thought that we should break
up into two separate groups.

226
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,099
{\an1}But now... a lot of time
has passed since then.

227
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:45,175
{\an4}We have to take into account
that the longer this takes, ^
the smaller our chances of
finding the captains.

228
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,647
{\an1}Put simply, we don't have the
time to return to the Leaf.

229
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:54,521
{\an4}Not to mention,  if we commit to
fighting all those puppets,
we'll exhaust our remaining
time.

230
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,167
{\an1}Why did I think that
you would be like Itachi?

231
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:06,005
Well, then? What
are you gonna do?

232
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:08,676
Are you gonna come
with us, Sasuke?

233
00:18:10,478 --> 00:18:12,948
{\an1}No, I'm not going to
go with you guys.

234
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:17,388
{\an1}I'll do things my
way, on my own.

235
00:18:21,427 --> 00:18:26,134
{\an1}Well, we succeeded in one
thing: we brought all the
Leaf genin together.

236
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:28,070
{\an1}But things aren't looking good.

237
00:18:28,103 --> 00:18:30,206
{\an1}Is there friction
between them?

238
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,742
{\an1}Why would they...

239
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:35,682
{\an1}If they decide to try to
break through that
barrier of puppets,

240
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:40,488
{\an4}it will mean they've chosen to
stick to the rules and place
their first priority on their
mission.

241
00:18:40,522 --> 00:18:46,530
{\an7}But then... if they decide to
ignore the puppets and instead
go to try to find their
comrades...

242
00:18:46,563 --> 00:18:52,238
{\an7}In that case, it would mean that
nothing was able to sway them
and that they'd made their
choice of their own free will...

243
00:18:52,272 --> 00:18:55,843
{\an7}...because they prioritized
saving their friends.

244
00:18:55,876 --> 00:19:01,352
{\an1}When they finally sop arguing
and coalesce into a united group
of Hidden Leaf Shinobi

245
00:19:01,385 --> 00:19:04,189
{\an1}I wonder which option
they're going to choose...

246
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,841
{\an1}So what will they do?

247
00:19:16,873 --> 00:19:25,787
{\an1}When they make their choice...
that's when we'll see the true
nature of these young shinobi.

248
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,626
{\an1}Think of it like kind
of an experiment.

249
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:34,065
{\an1}When the Eight Signed Seal is
loosened, even I don't know
what's going to happen.

250
00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:35,901
{\an1}You understand,
right?
Yeah!

251
00:19:35,934 --> 00:19:40,776
{\an1}then I, Jiraiya, one of the
Legendary Sannin, will stop him.
