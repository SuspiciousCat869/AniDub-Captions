1
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:53,447
{\an7}Allied Shinobi Forces Jutsu!

2
00:01:54,683 --> 00:01:56,283
{\an1}They're so pitiful.

3
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:57,851
Yeah.

4
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:02,189
{\an1}This hope that they're
clinging to doesn't exist.

5
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:06,060
{\an1}[chuckle] Just like their
very lives, at this point.

6
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,765
It seems the Ten
Tails is quite ready.

7
00:02:12,234 --> 00:02:14,101
{\an1}Fifth Gate of Closing! Open!

8
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:19,241
{\an1}So this time, they're coming
after us, not the Ten Tails.

9
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:22,644
{\an1}Well, it is basic strategy
to take out the enemy's

10
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:24,279
{\an1}brains, isn't it.

11
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,315
{\an1}<i>Just like we planned,</i>
<i>take down those two, the</i>

12
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:28,883
{\an1}<i>brains of Ten Tails!</i>

13
00:02:30,118 --> 00:02:32,420
{\an1}But in order to do that,
they would actually need to

14
00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:34,724
{\an1}stop the Ten Tails!

15
00:02:36,925 --> 00:02:37,826
[gasp]

16
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:42,598
[groaning]

17
00:02:42,632 --> 00:02:44,866
{\an1}What?! I thought we had
immobilized Ten Tails!

18
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,702
{\an1}You okay?! Damn it...

19
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:48,136
[gasp]

20
00:03:07,323 --> 00:03:09,091
{\an1}<i>My shoulder's dislocated!</i>

21
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:11,860
{\an1}Look at the Sensory Water
Sphere! It's practically

22
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:13,429
{\an1}like a small planet.

23
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:16,299
{\an1}But that's impossible!

24
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:19,368
Then we didn't
immobilize Ten Tails?

25
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:21,637
{\an1}It merely stopped moving
on its own to amass its

26
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:23,539
{\an1}power and transform?

27
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,541
So how can
we stop it, then?

28
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:27,343
{\an1}We can't target those two!

29
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:30,514
{\an1}But we have to find a
way to stop that thing

30
00:03:30,547 --> 00:03:32,749
{\an1}or else it's over
for all of us.

31
00:03:33,617 --> 00:03:34,950
[worried whine]

32
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:36,787
I'm about to pee
my pants, here.

33
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:37,853
[growl]

34
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:40,357
{\an1}Don't just freak out;
infuse your chakra!

35
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,261
{\an1}And be prepared to move when
we get the plan from HQ!

36
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:47,798
{\an1}We must immobilize
Ten Tails or else we

37
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,566
{\an1}won't be able to go after
the brains that are

38
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,767
manipulating it.

39
00:03:51,635 --> 00:03:54,504
{\an1}But how?! Even with the
jutsu of my clan, which

40
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:57,240
specializes in
immobilizing, the effect

41
00:03:57,274 --> 00:03:59,242
{\an1}would be miniscule
compared to the amount

42
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:00,877
{\an1}of chakra expended.

43
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,082
Inoichi! Link me
up with Kakashi!

44
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:06,249
Roger!

45
00:04:06,818 --> 00:04:08,218
{\an1}<i>Kakashi, it's me!</i>

46
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:08,952
Huh?

47
00:04:10,053 --> 00:04:11,421
{\an1}I want to confirm something
about the intel from the

48
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:12,757
{\an1}last battle sequence.

49
00:04:16,893 --> 00:04:18,995
{\an1}It is going to begin getting
more difficult to control

50
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,330
the Ten Tails.

51
00:04:20,897 --> 00:04:24,301
{\an1}Reinforce your bond with it
using Hashirama's cells.

52
00:04:25,235 --> 00:04:27,305
{\an1}We should take this
opportunity to check out Ten

53
00:04:27,338 --> 00:04:30,274
{\an1}Tails' power, while it's
in its current state.

54
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:31,975
{\an1}First, we should--

55
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:35,780
{\an1}Yes, let's show every
last one of them...

56
00:04:37,148 --> 00:04:39,250
{\an1}...what despair is!

57
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:47,658
Shikaku, I've
gotta go for now!

58
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:49,360
What it is?!

59
00:04:49,394 --> 00:04:51,696
{\an1}This is... No way!

60
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:55,734
Lord Shikaku!
Lord Inoichi!

61
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,770
{\an1}My Kamui won't be in time!

62
00:04:58,604 --> 00:05:00,371
{\an1}Displace it upwards
with Earth Style.

63
00:05:00,905 --> 00:05:01,607
Gotcha!

64
00:05:15,687 --> 00:05:17,256
{\an1}Whoa, that far away?!

65
00:05:17,723 --> 00:05:19,858
{\an1}It's much greater than
the other Tailed Beasts!

66
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:21,926
What power!

67
00:05:22,994 --> 00:05:25,197
{\an1}It's shakey from just
that little counter.

68
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:27,132
{\an1}Its control isn't
perfect yet.

69
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,066
The next one!

70
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:32,070
[roar]

71
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:51,925
{\an1}Unbelievable! A distant
city, gone like that! Huh?

72
00:05:57,062 --> 00:06:00,300
{\an1}It's been acting weird! It
seems to be aiming afar!

73
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,368
{\an1}So every city and
person is within its

74
00:06:02,402 --> 00:06:04,002
{\an1}range of fire, huh?

75
00:06:04,036 --> 00:06:06,606
{\an1}That means the Feudal
Lords, everyone guarding the

76
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,142
{\an1}villages plus all
of the citizens of

77
00:06:09,175 --> 00:06:11,044
{\an1}each nation are at risk?

78
00:06:11,077 --> 00:06:13,279
{\an1}The reason for this war
is so our shinobi on the

79
00:06:13,313 --> 00:06:16,082
{\an1}battlefield can protect
everyone else.

80
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:19,352
{\an1}But those two want to
remove that reason.

81
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:27,360
[roar]

82
00:06:28,328 --> 00:06:29,395
{\an1}That's the direction of--!

83
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:33,868
This, This is...

84
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:35,268
{\an1}What's is it, Lord Ao?!

85
00:06:37,003 --> 00:06:39,038
Please listen
to me calmly...

86
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:47,080
Right here, huh?

87
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:50,584
{\an1}Shikaku... What now?

88
00:06:50,851 --> 00:06:52,586
Just keep doing
what we must do.

89
00:06:53,988 --> 00:06:57,024
{\an1}I have a plan to stop
Ten Tails, our final act.

90
00:06:57,892 --> 00:07:00,294
{\an1}Put me through to
everyone on the battlefield.

91
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:13,975
[grunt]

92
00:07:40,036 --> 00:07:41,369
{\an1}Finally got them.

93
00:07:42,404 --> 00:07:45,073
{\an1}Now we've smashed the
Allied Forces' brains.

94
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:47,409
{\an1}Simple basic strategy.

95
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,380
Shikamaru...

96
00:07:52,414 --> 00:07:54,850
{\an1}We're in the middle of a
war. So don't waste any

97
00:07:54,884 --> 00:07:56,351
words on me.

98
00:07:57,485 --> 00:07:58,888
Or on Ino.

99
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:03,491
We have to do
what we have to do.

100
00:08:03,993 --> 00:08:05,494
{\an1}Just like father said.

101
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:20,076
{\an1}Wait, hold on! What the
heck just happened?!

102
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:22,778
{\an1}You are the key to our
whole plan, Naruto.

103
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:24,146
No, not that!

104
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,416
{\an1}I'm asking what happened
to Shikaku and Inoichi!

105
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,923
[screaming]

106
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:35,458
{\an1}Neji! Rotate clockwise!

107
00:08:35,491 --> 00:08:36,158
Right!

108
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:38,327
Eight Trigrams
Palm Rotation!

109
00:08:38,594 --> 00:08:40,396
A- Amazing...

110
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:44,266
{\an1}Don't just stand there
spacing out, Naruto!

111
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,603
{\an1}This is a battlefield
and we are at war.

112
00:08:47,604 --> 00:08:49,506
People die!

113
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:51,775
{\an1}But if we're defeated
and lose this war

114
00:08:51,808 --> 00:08:54,176
{\an1}everyone will die!

115
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,080
{\an1}Of course. I know that!

116
00:08:57,948 --> 00:09:00,984
{\an1}Shikamaru's and Ino's
fathers might say that as

117
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:04,421
{\an1}shinobi, they're glad they
died before their children.

118
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:06,690
{\an1}The same as my father did.

119
00:09:09,493 --> 00:09:12,796
{\an1}Listen, Naruto! Your power
is crucial to the plan.

120
00:09:13,163 --> 00:09:15,465
{\an1}So until we're able
to execute it...

121
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:17,035
{\an1}...we must protect you!

122
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:18,870
Hinata!

123
00:09:19,837 --> 00:09:22,205
{\an1}Just know this! The
Hyuga are the mightiest

124
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:23,674
among the Leaf!

125
00:09:24,108 --> 00:09:26,443
{\an1}I was hoping to take them
down before they started

126
00:09:26,476 --> 00:09:29,513
{\an1}with the speeches but
it is difficult to

127
00:09:29,546 --> 00:09:31,683
control the Ten
Tails well.

128
00:09:33,618 --> 00:09:35,352
{\an1}I suppose this ought
to do until the next

129
00:09:35,385 --> 00:09:36,654
transformation.

130
00:09:37,254 --> 00:09:39,457
But afterward
I suspect that

131
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,126
{\an1}only Jinchuriki will
be able to control it.

132
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:47,065
{\an1}Though for me to become
the Ten Tails' Jinchuriki,

133
00:09:47,098 --> 00:09:50,234
{\an1}I am going to need to become
fully and truly alive.

134
00:09:50,268 --> 00:09:52,603
Not just hosted
within a corpse as

135
00:09:52,637 --> 00:09:54,272
{\an1}a mere Reanimation.

136
00:09:54,305 --> 00:09:57,942
{\an1}Reanimations are good
for big suicidal attacks.

137
00:09:57,975 --> 00:10:00,812
{\an1}But the reason you haven't
launched the Ten Tails'

138
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:02,780
{\an1}Tailed Beast Bomb
at them, blowing

139
00:10:02,814 --> 00:10:05,583
{\an1}yourself up as well,
is that I'd get caught

140
00:10:05,616 --> 00:10:07,618
{\an1}in it and die, too.

141
00:10:07,652 --> 00:10:10,723
{\an1}And the reason that
would be a problem is,

142
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:13,357
{\an1}for you to truly be
brought back to life and

143
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:16,595
{\an1}become a Jinchuriki,
you will still need me to

144
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:20,766
{\an1}sacrifice myself and perform
Art of Rinne Rebirth on you.

145
00:10:21,265 --> 00:10:25,070
{\an1}In short, you're in a very
delicate position right now

146
00:10:25,104 --> 00:10:27,706
where you're
entirely at my mercy.

147
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,208
{\an1}Don't forget that.

148
00:10:30,008 --> 00:10:32,244
{\an1}Well, well, well, my
little rug rat has become

149
00:10:32,277 --> 00:10:34,214
{\an1}quite the wily fox.

150
00:10:34,246 --> 00:10:36,482
{\an1}You realize that I've
never really considered

151
00:10:36,515 --> 00:10:38,016
you a comrade.

152
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,085
[chuckle]

153
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:40,652
Well, so be it.

154
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,091
{\an1}All right, why don't you

{\an1}And all of your flippant

{\an1}will become lies.

{\an1}This is the end result
of ideals and hope.

{\an1}Naruto, what is there here
for you in this reality?

225
00:15:45,631 --> 00:15:49,068
{\an1}Your mother and father are
gone. Your Master, Jiraiya,

226
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:52,472
{\an1}too. And if you keep
standing against us,

227
00:15:52,505 --> 00:15:56,708
{\an1}you'll continue to lose
your friends one by one.

228
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:59,978
{\an1}This shall become a
world where no one who

229
00:16:00,012 --> 00:16:02,048
acknowledges you
will exist.

00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:07,786
The only thing
that awaits you is

232
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,759
{\an1}your worst nightmare,
which you know very well!

238
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,951
{\an1}So why keep living
in reality, huh?

239
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:42,389
{\an1}Now come join us, Naruto!

240
00:16:56,437 --> 00:16:58,606
{\an1}Neji just said that
in your hands

241
00:16:58,638 --> 00:17:01,142
you hold more
than one life.

242
00:17:01,175 --> 00:17:03,444
{\an1}Do you understand
what he meant?

243
00:17:03,477 --> 00:17:04,912
Do you?

244
00:17:08,682 --> 00:17:11,118
"I'll never let
my comrades die."

245
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,254
Those words and
the conviction behind

246
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:15,823
{\an1}them are not lies!

247
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:18,493
{\an1}For he stored them in
his heart and lived them

248
00:17:18,527 --> 00:17:20,027
{\an1}out till the end!

249
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:22,497
Neji really did!

250
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:30,172
{\an1}It isn't just you.
It's all of us.

251
00:17:30,572 --> 00:17:33,441
{\an1}We all hold those words
and feelings in our hearts.

252
00:17:33,475 --> 00:17:36,877
{\an1}They're what bind
our lives together

253
00:17:36,912 --> 00:17:39,881
{\an1}and make us comrades.

254
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:45,120
{\an1}If we were to all give
up and discard those

255
00:17:45,153 --> 00:17:46,955
{\an1}words and feelings.

256
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:49,491
{\an1}Neji's act'll have
been for nothing.

257
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:54,863
And that is when
your comrades truly die!

258
00:17:55,598 --> 00:17:57,933
{\an1}For you are no longer
comrades then.

259
00:17:58,534 --> 00:18:00,101
{\an1}That's how I feel.

260
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:09,278
{\an1}So, please, stand up
together with me, Naruto.

261
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,881
{\an1}Because never going
back on one's word...

262
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:16,785
That is also
my Ninja Way!

00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:23,993
{\an1}Hinata is willing
to die for you.

265
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:28,998
{\an1}So remember you hold
more than one life.

266
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,534
Of course it's
more than one!

00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:34,036
Don't forget
about me, either!

268
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,739
I know that! My
bonds are serious!

269
00:18:36,772 --> 00:18:39,775
{\an1}I'd never abandon
my comrades!

270
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:42,646
{\an1}But the truth is, Neji...

271
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:44,747
Stop whining
and complaining!
