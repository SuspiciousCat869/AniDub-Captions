{\an1}Of course.

137
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,539
{\an1}Excuse me,
one moment.

138
00:14:54,573 --> 00:14:57,442
{\an1}Lord Hiashi Hyuga and
his party, I presume?

139
00:14:57,475 --> 00:14:58,843
What is it?

140
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:03,415
{\an1}Sir, I am a border guard.
We've just received word
of a dire emergency.

141
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:06,586
{\an1}The Akatsuki are
attacking the
Hidden Leaf Village.

142
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:08,020
{\an1}What!?

143
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:10,122
{\an1}Make haste! We
must return at once!

144
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:28,009
{\an7}<i>This is terrible.</i>

145
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:35,084
{\an7}<i>The Leaf Village has </i>
<i>been destroyed. I can't</i>
<i>even recognize it.</i>

146
00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:36,919
{\an8}<i>What happened to</i>
<i>everyone?</i>

147
00:15:36,952 --> 00:15:39,722
{\an1}Lord Hiashi! Thank
goodness you're all right!

148
00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:44,226
{\an1}This destruction...
how many fatalities
were there?

149
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:47,697
{\an1}By some miracle,
everyone survived.

150
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:51,836
[gasp] But how!?
With all this
destruction...?

151
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:59,343
{\an5}<i>(Hyuga Man)</i>
<i>No, it's true sir. Naruto</i>
<i>protected everyone. But he was</i>
<i>only because of Lady Hinata.</i>

152
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:01,113
What do you mean?

153
00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:05,951
{\an4}The village was attacked
by Pain of the Akatsuki
and was right on the
verge of collapsing.

154
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:10,155
{\an1}At that point, the only
one who was able to deal
with Pain was Naruto Uzumaki.

155
00:16:10,188 --> 00:16:13,126
{\an1}<i>...But even Naruto was</i>
<i>pushed to his limits...</i>

156
00:16:13,158 --> 00:16:14,427
{\an1}Loud-mouthed frog.

157
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,461
{\an1}Bastard!

158
00:16:15,495 --> 00:16:18,831
{\an1}It's time we were
on our way, now...

159
00:16:18,865 --> 00:16:21,401
[gasp]

160
00:16:24,104 --> 00:16:27,675
<i>(Hyuga Man)</i>
<i>Lady Hinata was the one</i>
<i>who rushed into action.</i>

161
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,545
Hiya!

162
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,591
{\an8}<i>How cruel... </i>
<i>restricting Naruto's</i>
<i>movement with those rods...</i>

163
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,995
{\an1}I won't let you hurt
Naruto anymore!

164
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:47,763
No...

165
00:16:48,364 --> 00:16:51,267
I'm jus being
selfish now.

166
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,273
{\an4}What's that mean!?
Hinata, don't put
yourself in danger
like this! Just go!

167
00:16:56,306 --> 00:17:00,310
{\an1}I'm here because
I want to be.

168
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:04,882
{\an1}This time, I am going
to save you, Naruto.

169
00:17:05,717 --> 00:17:13,492
{\an4}I used to be such a
crybaby... a;ways
giving up before I even
got a chance to start.

170
00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:19,631
{\an4}I almost took the
wrong path so many
times... that I
lost count...

171
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,237
{\an1}But you helped me find
my way and take the
correct path, Naruto.

172
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:31,411
{\an4}I always chased after you,
wanting to catch up,
wanting to walk together
with you forever...

173
00:17:33,748 --> 00:17:36,417
{\an1}You've changed who
I am, Naruto!

174
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:40,688
{\an7}You're smiling face...
saved me, Naruto.

175
00:17:41,723 --> 00:17:47,329
{\an7}That's why I'm not
afraid to die here...
If it means I can
protect you!

176
00:17:52,334 --> 00:18:00,944
{\an8}Because...
I love you!
I always will.

177
00:18:02,746 --> 00:18:07,851
<i>(Hyuga Man)</i>
<i>Lady Hinata protected Naruto</i>
<i>and fought till the end...</i>

178
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:13,323
[grunt]

179
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:19,064
Gentle Step...
Twin Lion Fists!

180
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:24,770
{\an1}Because of that, she was
able to get us out of the
tough situation we were in.

181
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:36,217
{\an1}Hinata really did that!?

182
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,686
{\an7}<i>So Elder Sister mastered</i>
<i>that jutsu...</i>

183
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:45,760
It was such an
amazing surprise!

184
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:56,172
{\an4}Honestly, I almost
couldn't believe
Hinata was capable
of so much!

185
00:18:56,206 --> 00:19:01,911
{\an7}<i>I bet that Elder Sister</i>
<i>was never a failure</i>
<i>after all...</i>

186
00:19:01,945 --> 00:19:04,547
{\an1}Elder Sister Hinata!

187
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:20,799
{\an1}But I don't wanna
give up... I want
to become strong!

188
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:26,504
{\an4}I know that I can
change... Watching
Naruto makes me
think so.

189
00:19:26,705 --> 00:19:32,712
{\an1}I never will go back
on my word. Because
that's my Ninja Way!

190
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:37,351
{\an1}Yes, well, I can't
fall behind Naruto,
can I!?

191
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:41,221

{\an8}<i>...And look how</i>

193

195
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,646
Father... I
have a request.

196
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,051
I realize you're going
to be very busy with
rebuilding the village.

197
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:11,453
But when things settle
back down, will you
train with me again?

198
00:20:13,823 --> 00:20:16,093
{\an1}I bet you'll master
it next time!

199
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:18,495
I will!

200
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:21,499
{\an7}<i>I want to be like</i>
<i>Elder Sister Hinata</i>
<i>someday...</i>

201

<i>my own path too...</i>
<i>without being influenced</i>

<i>of the Fourth Great</i>
<i>Ninja War!</i>

203
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:42,689
{\an1}So we will capitalize on
out sensory skills and divide
up to support every battalion!

204
00:20:42,722 --> 00:20:46,260
{\an1}It's up to us to guide
them to victory in
this war!

{\an8}Yes, Sir!

{\an1}Hanabi, take care
of things.

207
00:20:50,998 --> 00:20:55,970
{\an1}I'll handle it. I've made
up my own mind to ensure
the Hyuga Clan's protection.

208
00:20:56,003 --> 00:20:58,873
But, also, please be
careful, Elder Sister.

209
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:03,712
{\an7}I will! I'm going to
throw everything I've
learned at the enemy!

210
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,049
{\an7}And I will
protect Naruto.

211
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,886
Do your best, Elder
Sister Hinata.
