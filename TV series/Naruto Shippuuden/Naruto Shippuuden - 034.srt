it's far too risky for him.

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,130
My lady, just
imagine if something

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,164
were to happen to him.

11
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,638
-Hm, I won't say it again.

12
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,240
Naruto and Sakura are
part of Team Kakashi,

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,643
and that's who I've
assigned to this mission.

14

my reasoning.

-I understand that, my lady.

16

But still, it's not
really Team Kakashi

even go with them.

In the last mission,

to get their hands on Naruto.

you think you're going?

SAKURA (VOICEOVER): The only
reason they couldn't was

29
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,048
because Kakashi
Sensei was there,

30
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,683

would have concerns.

-Hm.

67

Henceforth, regarding
Naruto, he must not

be dispatched on missions
that might bring him

it from Shizune, ad nauseam.

you assign Naruto

-Tsunade, Naruto is not
just an ordinary child.

89
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,656
He is a jinchuriki.

90
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,325
-Normally, we would never even
send him outside the Village,

91
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,694
and we'd keep him under
surveillance at all times.

92

So you see, we're
offering a compromise.

93

-Well, I'm in favor for using
the four-man squad model

94
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:21,107
for his team, but you cannot
impose any more restrictions

00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,642
on him.

96
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:26,980
So long as Naruto remains in one
place, the Leaf is in danger.

97
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,649
Sooner or later, the
Akatsuki will come for him.

98
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,618
In the Hidden Sand
Village incident,

99
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,120
they headed straight for
the jinchuriki, Gaara,

100
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,989
even though he was
supposedly in the safest

101
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:36,990
location in the Village.

102
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,596
And if they come
after Naruto, you

103
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,632
can bet the Akatsuki
will be just as

104
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,135
brutal as they were then.

105
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,738
And at the end of the day,
that would put the Leaf Village

106
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:52,973
in danger, as well.

107
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,382
But if Naruto stays
on the move, the enemy

108
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,651
will have a tough time
figuring out what he's up to

109
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:05,552
and how to get him.

110
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,391
Let's not forget, he
is a boy with talent.

111
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:16,262
He's a fine ninja and a
great asset to the Leaf.

-Correct me if
I'm wrong, but you

116

can't ensure that Naruto won't
be taken by the Akatsuki.

And if they do get
control of the Nine-Tails,

118
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,383
tell me what
guarantees you can make

you have any balls at all?

Oh, for crying out loud.

Asuma Sensei's
getting pretty mad,

you to get a move on.

-Oh hey, sorry, Ino.

Some weirdo just came and
attacked us out of nowhere, so--

Kakashi, their team leader,
he's out of commission.

But nobody told
you that, did they?

-Um, see, the team
needs one more member.

201
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,864
They have to start the mission
before Kakashi Hatake will have

finished recuperating, and
we don't have much time

This decision should
belong to Lady Tsunade.

expecting Kakashi

to be missing from
the team, either.

I had only just started
to figure out what to do.

-It's clear.

209
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,352
What you require is an
exceptionally distinguished

from the Black Ops,

assigned directly to the Hokage.

-Yes, that choice would be wise.

-I trust you have no
objections, Tsunade.

selection up to me.

Is that OK with you?

-I'm talking about that man.

I had the same idea,
appointing an ANBU Black Ops

under my command to
fill in for Kakashi.

230

I even had someone
specific in mind,

00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:07,633
but I never thought they'd
suggest the exact same thing.

I totally thought
they were going

233
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,670
to force another one of
their subordinates on me.

234
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,877
Hm, does this mean they
think one person is

235
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,847
enough to keep tabs on Naruto?

236
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:25,717
Or maybe they're after
something else entirely.

-One more thing.

Team Kakashi will be getting
a new face in its ranks,

259
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:56,308
from The Foundation, the
Black Ops training division.

-And the reason for this?

266

-This additional
recruit was recommended

by a man named Danzo.

268
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,830
Not only is Danzo a member
of the Hawk Faction,

opposed the Third

detail within Black Ops,

a training division know
only as The Foundation.

272
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,377
Danzo was the one who
founded the division.

be careful out there.

322
00:22:23,713 --> 00:22:24,814
NARUTO: Got it.

323
00:22:24,847 --> 00:22:28,651
NARRATOR: Next time, "An
Unnecessary Addition."

325
00:22:40,563 --> 00:22:44,300
CHOJI: Society for Leaf
tourism-- all right, today

326
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,470
we'll be introducing you
to the BBQ restaurant.

327
00:22:47,503 --> 00:22:49,305
This is the spot
where we celebrated

328
00:22:49,338 --> 00:22:50,873
Shikamaru's promotion to chunin.

329

[sizzle]

330
00:22:53,376 --> 00:22:55,511
-Oh man, that looks goo--

331
00:22:55,545 --> 00:22:56,746
-Hold it, Naruto.

332
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:59,782
It's very tricky to grill
the meat so it's just right.

333
00:22:59,815 --> 00:23:01,784
You better let me taste it.

334
00:23:01,817 --> 00:23:03,686
Hm.

335
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:05,521
-Wha-- hey!

336
00:23:05,555 --> 00:23:06,856
Stop, Choji.

337
00:23:06,889 --> 00:23:08,424
You can't hog all the meat.

338
00:23:08,424 --> 00:23:10,426
-Don't be so naive, Naruto.

339
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:11,360
Barbecue is war.

340
00:23:11,394 --> 00:23:12,295
-Say what?

341
00:23:12,328 --> 00:23:13,729
-Calm down, Naruto.

342
00:23:13,763 --> 00:23:16,699
-Tell that to Fatso!

343
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:19,402
-Oh, that word is taboo.

344
00:23:19,435 --> 00:23:20,970
-Uh-oh.

345
00:23:21,003 --> 00:23:22,672
-I am not fat.

346
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:25,541
I am chubby!

347
00:23:25,575 --> 00:23:30,913
[screams]

348
00:23:30,947 --> 00:23:32,882
-Oh, man.

349
00:23:32,915 --> 00:23:35,418
Can't you guys even
eat barbecue in peace?

350
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:37,286
You're both such a drag.

351
00:23:37,286 --> 00:23:39,422
-I want meat.
