00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,070
He's not moving.

3
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,050
He's still down.

-Naruto.

8
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,080
You all right?

9
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,210
-Hold him steady, Choji, OK?

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,170
Just like that.

11
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:53,020
Right now, I can only give
him emergency first aid.

12
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,060
That was something, Naruto.

13
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,180
Who would have ever thought
that the real you was

14
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,020
hidden among the clones?

as dumb as you look.

Not in Shikamaru's
league yet, but--

-Please, don't
compare me to him.

19
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,150
-I'm impressed that
you could pull off

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,170
that jutsu three times in a row.

21
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,210
You were only able to
do it twice in training.

22

-(VOICEOVER) Such confidence.

23

And the wit to turn failure
on its head and quickly

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,230
plan his next move.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,030
Naruto has become strong.

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,200
Truly strong.

27
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,120
Jutsu that were beyond
the Fourth Hokage

28
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,020
are well within his command.

29
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,030
I guess it's time to
finally pass the torch.

30
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,030
He's surpassed me.

31
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,080
Can you sense it?

32
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,060
You're the one who's
always before his eyes.

33
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,230
Inspiring him.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,070
It's you who makes him strong.

35
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,120
You know that.

36
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,050
Don't you, Sasuke?

37
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,020
-Kakashi.

38
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,070
Time to move.

-OK, everyone.

43
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,100
We're heading back
to the Leaf village.

44
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,080
-Where's Kakashi-sensei?

45
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,090
-Tying up loose ends.

46
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,200
-Defeated by a pack of brats.

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,140
Ugh.

48
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,220
Incredible.

49
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,100
-You did fight the First Hokage.

50
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,150
It's no wonder you
see us as brats.

51
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,200
But it cuts both ways.

52
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:47,050
To our eyes, you're just an
old geezer whose time is over.

53
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,070
And so here you are.

54
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,100
Dying.

55
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,010
Hugging the earth like a worm.

56
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,090
One by one, the new generation
will catch up to you.

57
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,220
And in the end,
they'll surpass you.

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,230
But it's not time to
celebrate just yet.

62

Not when there are still more
of the Akatsuki at large.

Naruto.

64
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,200
Those wounds of yours.

65

-Yeah.

66
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,000
Kind of like a
badge of honor, huh?

67
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,190
-We gave him some
preliminary treatment,

68
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,000
just to stabilize him.

69
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,210
-Make sure he gets
to the hospital

70
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,190
for a full examination.

No, you're not!

Don't you worry, my lady.

I'll make sure he gets there.

Right, Naruto?

-Ow!

-All right, then.

81
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,190
And as far as the rest
of you are concerned,

82
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,100
I order you all to
take a few days off.

Dismissed.

-Yes.

with you later, OK?

Shikamaru.

109

You've lost a Shogi
partner, haven't you?

110
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,060
You were always Asuma's
favorite student, you know that?

111
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,030
You must miss him too.

the things Asuma taught me

over the years, some
things being more

114

important than others,
Shogi was only one of them.

115

If I said I didn't
miss him, I'd be lying.

But I'm not a kid anymore.

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,230
I'm expected to
act my age, right?

I'm not allowed to do
the self-pity thing.

Hmm.

120
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:24,200
I used to complain about
what a drag everything was.

121
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,020
I made a lot of
mistakes that way.

122
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,000
And every time I did,
Asuma came to my rescue.

123
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,180
He was an odd teacher.

124
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,060
Kind of elusive,
hard to figure out.

125
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,150
But to me, he was a
terrific role model.

126

Well, looks like it's
finally my turn now.

127

When that baby arrives,
it'll be my turn

you inside and out.

00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,160
And checkmate.

169
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,080
-Wha-- huh?

170
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:28,040
-You're not quite good enough
yet at protecting the King.

171
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,120
You'll need to work harder.

172
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,130
-Awww.

173
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,060
Damn it!

174
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,080
-You're too darn reckless.

175
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,160
That's your problem.

176
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,020
-Why are you getting
so upset, anyway?

177
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,457
-Shut up.

178
00:11:44,457 --> 00:11:47,210
Don't talk back.

179
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,200
-(VOICEOVER) Abrasions.

180
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,020
Contusions.

181
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,210
None of these wounds
is very serious.

182
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,210
The real problem is this arm.

183
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,160
It's broken in several places.

184
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,110
[gasp]

185
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,230
-(VOICEOVER) His body just
isn't up to using this jutsu.

186
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,170
-I see.

187
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,230
So these are the examiner's
conclusions regarding Kakuzu?

188
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,190
-Yes, my lady,
though the autopsy

189
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,200
isn't totally complete yet.

190
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:38,000
-In any case, the supervising
Jonin will have to be informed.

191
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,020
-Kakashi and Yamato?

192
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,080
-Go and find them.

193
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,200
Bring them to the
coroner's office.

194
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:53,010
[wind howling]

195
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,120
-Well, well.

196
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,170
So, Hidan and
Kakuzu are dead, eh?

197
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,230
-Yes.

198
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,150
It seems they were defeated
by Naruto and his team.

199
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,000
-Ah.

200
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:03,060
-We thought that they might take
out some more of the Akatsuki

201
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,040
if we allowed them to live.

202
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,060
Looks like we made
a wise decision.

203
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:08,497
-Yes.

204
00:14:08,497 --> 00:14:10,060
Not bad at all.

205
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,040
I'm sure the Akatsuki never
imagined in their worst

206
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,060
nightmares losing two of
their members in one blow.

207
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,130
It must be very
disappointing for them.

208
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,170
[laughter]

209
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,220
-Still, they do
possess the Two-Tails.

210
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,070
We really must do
everything we can

211
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,170
to thin out their
ranks even more.

212
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,200
And what about the boy?

213
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,020
Is he coming along well?

214
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,080
-Yes.

215
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,160
I've planned the final test
for a few days from now.

216
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,030
But judging from all my data,
there should be no problem.

217
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,497
-Hmm.

218
00:14:42,497 --> 00:14:46,070
I look forward to it.

219
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,080
(VOICEOVER) It won't be long
now before the final step

220
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,180
can be taken.

221
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:55,130
But for that, it's essential
that we have one more pawn.

222
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,110
[laughter]

223
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
-That woman, Kabuto.

224
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,100
You know the one I mean.

225
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:06,020
Would you be good enough to
find her and bring her here?

226
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,120
[gasp]

227
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,180
-You mean that woman?

228
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,040
-The examination
isn't complete yet,

229
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,210
but we've already found out
something about this new jutsu

230
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,090
of Naruto's.

231
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,040
The damage this man
sustained didn't just

232
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,090
come from a barrage
of individual blows,

233
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,120
no matter how many
there might have been.

234
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,080
-Hmm?

235
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,200
What do you mean?

236
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,110
-As impossible as it may seem,
his entire chakra network

237
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,160
has been severed.

238
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,110
-His chakra network?

239
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,020
-Yes, that's right.

240
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:54,040
I know it's difficult to
imagine, but it's true.

241
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,130
-I didn't know the Wind-Style
Rasen Shuriken was so thorough.

242
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,160
-The effect on the body
is more like a poison

243
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,120
than a physical trauma.

244
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,110
It's an incredibly precise
attack, doing its damage

245
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,010
on the cellular level.

246
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,220
I believe it shapes
the wind chakra

247
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,170
into a blizzard of
miniature swords,

248
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,210
and systematically attacks
every cell in the body.

249
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,130
-That is some jutsu.

250
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,230
-Poison, indeed.

251
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,170
So it would be more
accurate to speak

252
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,020
in terms of concentration,
rather than in number

253
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,468
of attacks.

254
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,200
-And Naruto?

255
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,010
How about the one
who used the jutsu?

256
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,130
-Well, there lies the problem.

257
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,090
-I see.

258
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,210
-Kakashi.

259
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,100
Whatever happens,
don't let Naruto

260
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,140
try to use Rasen Shuriken again.

261
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,090
[gasp]

262
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,180
-It's that serious?

263
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,050
-I saw those same symptoms
in Naruto's right arm.

264
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,220
Not as severe, but the same.

265
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,010
If he keeps using that
jutsu, sooner or later,

266
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,100
he'll lose it-- the
ability to wield chakra.

267
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,220
[sigh]

268
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,220
[loud ringing]

269
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,150
I

270
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,100
-It's a powerful jutsu.

271
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,190
It comes with risks.

272
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,160
-Once any cell in the
body has been disconnected

273
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:49,030
from the chakra network, it's
beyond my ability to heal it,

274
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,150
even with my medical ninjutsu.

275
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,230
Make sure Naruto
understands that.

276
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,020
-Of all things, wanting
to summon that woman.

277
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,010
[gasp]

278
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,210
-Not a very friendly
greeting, Guren.

279
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:02,020
[laughter]

280
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,170
-Oh.

281
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,210
It's only you, Kabuto.

282
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,140
I thought it might be an
enemy intruder or something.

283
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,130
-Right.

284
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,170
You did that on
purpose, didn't you?

285
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,130
-Of course not.

286
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,100
Besides, anyone who could
have been killed that easily

287
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,170
is unworthy to stand at the side
of Orochimaru, don't you think?

288
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,020
-All right.

289
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,050
Done.

290
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,070
Now, you just take
it easy, will you?

291
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,220
-Thanks a lot, Sakura.

292
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,140
-Hey, Naruto.

293
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,010
This new jutsu of yours is
only a last resort, right?

294
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,060
Promise you'll think
before using it.

295
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,070
-Haha, what's the big deal?

296
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,030
Long as you're here
to patch me up.

297
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,020
-That's not the point.

298
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,050
Medical ninjutsu's
not a miracle.

299
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,020
There are limits to
what I can patch up.

300
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,170
-But still.

301
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,110
I kind of like things this way.

302
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,020
The way they are now.

-It's sort of like you and I are
on the road to finding Sasuke

305
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,100
together.

306

00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,010
-Hehehe.

[theme music - in Japanese]

310
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,230
-We've received a message
from the ANBU Black Ops

311
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,210
reconnaissance mission.

312
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,040
-It says-- where
Kakashi right now?

313
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,040
-I believe he's
working with Naruto.

314
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,100
-Fine.

315
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,220
But tell him to report to
me the minute he's finished.

316
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,080
-Is it a lead on
Orochimaru, do you think?

-Yes.

318
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,230
Seems the ANBU Black
Ops were getting

319
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,170
close when they were attacked.

320

We've got to assemble
