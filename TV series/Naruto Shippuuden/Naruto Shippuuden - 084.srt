1
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:18,210
-(VOICEOVER) I never expected
his arm to be able to function

2
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,001
independently from his body.

3
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:22,121
But how?

4
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:25,011
And when did he-- Wait.

5
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:26,081
Yeah.

6
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:28,021
When I attacked them
with the paper bombs,

7
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:30,021
he must have hidden
his arm in the ground

8
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:32,032
under cover of the smoke.

9
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:33,082
Grr.

10
00:00:33,092 --> 00:00:36,022
It's such a drag the way
each of these Akatsuki

11
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:38,172
has unique powers.

12
00:00:38,182 --> 00:00:42,102
-I guess it's not quite
all over yet, is it?

13
00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:46,023
As you can plainly see, my
abilities are countless.

14
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:49,072
You'll be wise to retreat
and plan your next move.

15
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,052
That is, if you're smart.

16
00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:54,172
Unlike my partner here.

17
00:00:54,182 --> 00:00:55,103
-Ahhh!

18
00:00:55,113 --> 00:00:57,053
I can't control my body!

19
00:00:57,063 --> 00:00:58,035
Ah!

20
00:00:58,035 --> 00:00:59,053
Do something, Kakuzu!

21
00:00:59,053 --> 00:01:02,173
Do something!

22
00:01:02,173 --> 00:01:03,173
-Oof.

23
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:04,173
Damn it!

24
00:01:04,173 --> 00:01:05,173
-(VOICEOVER) Now, Choji.

25
00:01:05,173 --> 00:01:06,173
Now!

26
00:01:06,173 --> 00:01:09,164
Spiking Human Boulder!

27
00:01:09,174 --> 00:01:10,044
-Kakuzu!

28
00:01:27,144 --> 00:01:30,064
-(VOICEOVER) Such-- such power.

29
00:01:41,105 --> 00:01:43,135
-Sakura, don't you
think Naruto should

30
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,046
take a break at some point?

31
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:46,146
-There's no time.

32
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:49,066
Our team won't get to go
as backup to Kakashi-sensei

33
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:54,125
and the others unless Naruto
can perfect that new jutsu.

34
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:57,066
-The time limit is 24 hours.

35
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:59,086
-It's not going to be
easy, but we've just

36
00:01:59,096 --> 00:02:00,216
got to believe in him.

37
00:02:00,226 --> 00:02:03,086
Because no one has the
history with Kakashi-sensei

38
00:02:03,096 --> 00:02:05,046
that we have, and so
we've got to make sure

39
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:08,066
that we're the ones who
get sent to back him up.

40
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:10,147
[theme music - in japanese]

41
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,132
-All right!

42
00:04:07,142 --> 00:04:09,172
So close, I'm almost there.

43
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:15,053
Sasuke and I will
be equals then.

44
00:04:15,063 --> 00:04:17,103
-Yes, indeed you will.

45
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:21,013
But you'll have to watch out for
Sasuke's fire change in nature.

46
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:22,113
-Huh?

47
00:04:22,113 --> 00:04:24,154
-There are negative and
positive relationships

48
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:28,114
between the five great
changes in nature.

49
00:04:28,124 --> 00:04:31,234
-Wait, there are negative
and positive what?

50
00:04:31,244 --> 00:04:36,035
-The five natures, by which
I mean fire, water, earth,

51
00:04:36,035 --> 00:04:39,034
lightning, and wind,
all have a different way

52
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:40,154
of relating to each other.

53
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,134
A different relationship, see?

54
00:04:42,144 --> 00:04:43,194
-Well, sort of.

55
00:04:43,194 --> 00:04:45,044
What does it mean?

56
00:04:45,054 --> 00:04:46,144
-Here.

57
00:04:46,154 --> 00:04:48,065
Perhaps a diagram will help you
to picture it a little better.

58
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:54,085
The five great changes
in chakra nature.

59
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:57,125
This is how we depict them
on paper, in a circle.

60
00:04:57,135 --> 00:04:58,115
You with me?

61
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,215
-OK.

62
00:04:59,225 --> 00:05:00,226
-Now, then.

63
00:05:00,236 --> 00:05:03,136
If we move clockwise
around the circle,

64
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:06,056
we see each one's
strength relative to those

65
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:07,106
on either side of it.

66
00:05:07,116 --> 00:05:08,196
-Huh?

67
00:05:08,206 --> 00:05:11,205
-For example, fire is a
change in chakra nature

68
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:13,246
that is superior to wind.

69
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:19,146
However, it is inferior to
water change in chakra nature.

70
00:05:19,156 --> 00:05:22,146
Each nature is superior
to one, and also

71
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,086
inferior to another
in the circle.

72
00:05:27,197 --> 00:05:29,167
-Uh, right.

73
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:31,037
So what?

74
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:32,237
[sigh]

75
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:35,097
-(VOICEOVER) He's
not getting it.

76
00:05:35,107 --> 00:05:37,198
All right, let's
look at it this way.

77
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,178
Naruto, that Wind-Style
jutsu of yours

78
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:44,187
will always lose when it's up
against Sasuke's Fire-Style jutsu.

79
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:46,107
-Huh?

80
00:05:46,117 --> 00:05:49,218
Only Water-Style
beats Fire-Style.

81
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:53,138
-But why is my Wind Style
no good against Fire?

82
00:05:53,138 --> 00:05:56,028
-Well, try and picture
it in your mind.

83
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:58,148
With fire, when
the wind hits it,

84
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,098
it only makes the
flames burn higher.

85
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:05,249
On the other hand, if you've
douse the fire with water,

86
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:09,039
it goes out.

87
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:11,209
So, if you hit Sasuke's
Fire-Style jutsu

88
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:14,180
with a Wind-Style jutsu
of equal strength,

89
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,189
you'll only create an even
bigger Fire-Style jutsu

90
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,059
that he can then
deflect back at you.

91
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:21,029
[cough]

92
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:24,129
-Ugh.

93
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:27,180
-However, take a
look at the circle.

94
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,150
Wind may be inferior to fire,
and yet, on the other hand,

95
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,070
it's superior to lightning.

96
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,020
Which means your
new jutsu will be

97
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,111
superior to Sasuke's
Lightning-Style chidori.

98
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:41,071
-Ahhh!

99
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:44,061
-Naruto, you're lucky.

100
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:48,150
Be happy your change
in nature wasn't earth.

101
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,121
[sigh]

102
00:06:51,131 --> 00:06:55,171
-So then I'm a perfect
match for Sasuke?

103
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,231
-Well, yeah.

104
00:06:56,231 --> 00:06:58,231
Wind beats lightning, certainly.

105
00:06:58,241 --> 00:07:00,041
-No.

106
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,081
That's not what I meant.

107
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:02,191
-Huh?

108
00:07:02,201 --> 00:07:07,172
-What I meant was that only
my wind can assist and magnify

109
00:07:07,182 --> 00:07:08,122
his fire.

110
00:07:12,152 --> 00:07:13,232
-Yes.

111
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:15,163
That's true, too.

112
00:07:15,163 --> 00:07:17,163
-Naruto!

113
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:18,023
-Huh?

114
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:28,183
-Great work.

115
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:29,203
Really awesome!

116
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:30,123
-Thanks.

117
00:07:30,123 --> 00:07:31,163
-And your training.

118
00:07:31,163 --> 00:07:33,043
Is it going well?

119
00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:34,173
-You could say that.

120
00:07:34,183 --> 00:07:36,043
-So, you'll be done soon?

121
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:37,073
-Mm-hmm.

122
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,134
-Well, not quite yet.

123
00:07:39,144 --> 00:07:42,114
-Huh?

124
00:07:42,124 --> 00:07:45,204
-We still need a little
more time, I'm afraid.

125
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,174
There's one more
thing we have to try.

126
00:08:01,054 --> 00:08:03,244
-So, what do you
think's going on?

127
00:08:03,254 --> 00:08:05,045
-I knew it.

128
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:06,255
It's just like
Raido said before.

129
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:31,186
He's got some sort of jutsu that
allows him to harden his body.

130
00:08:31,196 --> 00:08:34,156
That's his special ability.

131
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,136
-Hmm.

132
00:08:35,146 --> 00:08:37,086
Good eye.

133
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:38,216
Yes, it's true.

134
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:42,027
Physical attacks are
virtually useless against me.

135
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:43,197
(VOICEOVER) I thought
I'd made allowances

136
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:45,137
for the extent of their powers.

137
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:47,087
But not this.

138
00:08:47,097 --> 00:08:51,067
If we can't use a direct
attack, what can we do?

139
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:52,177
-Uh, Shikamaru?

140
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:01,087
[laughter]

141
00:09:01,097 --> 00:09:02,097
-Be afraid.

142
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:04,207
Be afraid, you
ignorant heathens!

143
00:09:04,217 --> 00:09:05,198
Kakuzu!

144
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,218
Enough chitchat.

145
00:09:06,228 --> 00:09:08,118
Let's counterattack.

146
00:09:08,128 --> 00:09:10,078
Come on, hurry!

147
00:09:10,088 --> 00:09:12,208
Undo this idiotic jutsu already.

148
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,078
-Right.

149
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:16,058
-Oh!

150
00:09:16,068 --> 00:09:17,035
-Huh?

151
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:18,149
Oh!

152
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,219
-Oh, but how?

153
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:25,069
I didn't even sense
your approach.

154
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:26,169
[choking]

155
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:27,179
-Sorry about that.

[laughter]

157
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,150
-Be afraid, be afraid
you ignorant heathens!

158
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,180
Kakuzu!

159
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,170
Enough chitchat.

160
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,070
Let's counterattack.

161
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,030
Come on, hurry!

162
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,140
Undo this idiotic jutsu already.

163
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,100
-Right.

164
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,260
-Oh!

165
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,141
-Huh?

166
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:54,628
Oh!

167
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:55,131
-Huh?

168
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,091
-Oh, but how?

169
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:11,161
I didn't even sense
your approach.

171

-(VOICEOVER) Amazing.

00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:19,092
-Hey.

174
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:21,132
What the hell is going on?

175
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:23,082
What's all that crap
about physical attacks

176
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:25,092
being useless against you?

177
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,152
-Yeah, how?

178
00:10:26,162 --> 00:10:29,262
How did you get behind
the guy, Kakashi-sensei?

179
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:33,133
-I saw everything, including
that flesh-hardening jutsu

180
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:34,163
of yours.

181
00:10:34,173 --> 00:10:36,192
From the signs you
were weaving, it's

182
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:40,122
an Earth-Style jutsu, isn't it?

183
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:45,223
-You were able to read and
interpret my signs so quickly.

184
00:10:45,223 --> 00:10:49,213
And your mastery of
Lightning-Style jutsu-- Wait.

185
00:10:49,223 --> 00:10:50,213
That's it!

186
00:10:50,223 --> 00:10:53,193
You're Kakashi of the Sharingan!

187
00:10:53,203 --> 00:10:55,264
-Earth is inferior to lightning.

188
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:58,094
Not your lucky day.

189
00:10:58,104 --> 00:11:00,064
You done for.

00:11:00,074 --> 00:11:03,054
-(VOICEOVER) Kakashi-sensei
really is awesome.

191
00:11:03,064 --> 00:11:06,044
Now there's just one left.

192
00:11:06,054 --> 00:11:08,114
-Turn the tables,
just like that!

193
00:11:08,124 --> 00:11:10,034
Leave it to Kakashi-sensei.

194
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,114
-Yeah.

195
00:11:11,124 --> 00:11:14,064
And we wanted to get rid
of the mortal one first.

196
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,264
Less trouble this way.

197
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:16,144
-Ow!

198
00:11:16,154 --> 00:11:17,144
-Huh?

199
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:18,104
What is it?

200
00:11:18,114 --> 00:11:19,244
What's wrong, Shikamaru?

201
00:11:19,254 --> 00:11:21,075
-Uh-oh.

202
00:11:21,085 --> 00:11:22,205
Not looking good.

00:11:48,076 --> 00:11:49,116
I can't believe it.

00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,096

Well, who's done for now, huh?

Let's get this over
with, shall we?

My Shadow Possession's had it.

What are those things?

237
00:13:49,153 --> 00:13:51,152
And why-- why isn't he dead?

238
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:53,172
After that shot he took
from the Lightning Blade?

-Who knows.

240

After going head-to-head
with these guys,

241
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,213
there's nothing that'll
surprise me anymore.

There.

That's more like it.

Behold your servant!

I give myself, body and
soul, to the carnage to come.

-Kakuzu, what the hell was that?

You put on this big show,
and then one of them

drops dead before
we even get started.

That must be the one I hit with
my Lightning Blade just now.

We may be on to something here.

I want in on this action.

I'm sick of watching us get
pushed around by these losers.

So.

perform such high-level jutsu

with their own chakra nature.

then we can fight them.

338
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:05,137
-Which means we need someone
to divert that Hidan guy.

339
00:22:05,147 --> 00:22:06,157
-OK. I'll do it.

340
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:07,197
-No.

341
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:08,298
It's too risky.

342
00:22:09,068 --> 00:22:10,108
-Then I'll do it.

343
00:22:10,118 --> 00:22:11,148
-No, Choji.

344
00:22:11,158 --> 00:22:13,188
If he so much as scratches
you, it's all over.

345
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,168
You're done.

346
00:22:14,178 --> 00:22:15,152
-Then--

347
00:22:15,162 --> 00:22:16,290
-There's only one way to do it.

348
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,170
It has to be me.

349
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,100
I'll be the trap
and the diversion.

350
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,080
-Next time.

351
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,080
The Terrifying Secret.
