[angry roar]

4
00:02:01,377 --> 00:02:04,076
{\an1}I don't want to believe that
Lord Third planned all of

5
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,310
this in order to
return to power...

6
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:08,610
[gasp]

7
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,242
Kakashi...

8
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:26,476
Kakashi!

9
00:02:28,142 --> 00:02:29,376
Kakashi!

10
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:20,040
Hm?

11
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:21,741
Huh?

12
00:03:32,706 --> 00:03:33,972
[sigh]

13
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,239
So he's back to
ignoring me, huh.

14
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:39,440
<i>[street chatter]</i>

15
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:45,807
Wood Style!
Giant Forest Jutsu!

16
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:50,005
{\an1}Who's that boy who
can use Wood Style?

17
00:03:53,971 --> 00:03:56,071
{\an1}Maybe I'll find some
information there.

18
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:18,970
{\an1}"The Works of the
First Hokage."

19
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:25,304
Aha! Found it!

20
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:30,805
Hashirama Senju.

21
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,704
{\an1}The leader of the Senju
Clan of the Forest.

22
00:04:35,103 --> 00:04:38,136
{\an1}He brought peace and
stability to this bloody,

23
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,537
{\an1}war-torn world. He
and he alone mastered

24
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,236
{\an1}Wood Style Ninjutsu.

25
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:48,703
{\an1}He and he alone mastered
Wood Style Ninjutsu.

26
00:04:50,503 --> 00:04:52,570
{\an1}No. There's another.

27
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,837
{\an1}What does this mean? How is
he able to use Wood Style?

28
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:01,669
"Top secret?"

29
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,769
{\an1}Where are the files?!

30
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:08,135
Is this what you
are looking for?

31
00:05:08,536 --> 00:05:09,502
[gasp]

32
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,135
Professor!

33
00:05:15,202 --> 00:05:17,536
{\an1}It's all right. I
give you my permission.

34
00:05:18,335 --> 00:05:19,369
Go on, read it.

35
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,602
Yes, sir.

36
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:25,034
{\an1}Long ago, the First Hokage,
Lord Hashirama, after his

37
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:27,967
{\an1}death match with Madara,
used the Wood Style

38
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:30,301
{\an1}to suppress the Nine Tails.

39
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:32,568
{\an1}After that, there was
no one else to carry on

40
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:34,668
{\an1}the Wood Style Jutsu.

41
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,501
{\an1}Either the Sharingan
or Wood Style is needed

42
00:05:37,535 --> 00:05:39,568
{\an1}to suppress Tailed Beasts.

43
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:42,601
{\an1}Now, there was a period
of time in the Hidden Leaf

44
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:45,768
{\an1}Village when researchers
tried to revive the First

45
00:05:45,802 --> 00:05:47,901
{\an1}Hokage's Wood Style Jutsu.

46
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:50,600
However...

47
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,167
{\an1}Despite the dedicated
efforts of many, the tests

48
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,834
{\an1}to transplant Lord
Hashirama's cells all

49
00:05:57,867 --> 00:06:00,066
{\an1}failed, one after another.

50
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,033
{\an1}The number of lives
lost kept increasing.

51
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:06,700
{\an1}And so, unfortunately,
that jutsu...

52
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:13,433
{\an1}...was deemed a Forbidden
Jutsu and sealed away.

53
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,499
{\an1}But, as of late...

54
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,900
{\an1}There have been some genin
and chunin, and even members

55
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:23,900
{\an1}of the ANBU that have
mysteriously gone missing.

56
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:27,633
{\an1}What is even more
disturbing is that

57
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,266
{\an1}we've also had reports
of incidents in which

58
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:32,299
newborn infants
have been kidnapped

59
00:06:32,332 --> 00:06:34,532
{\an1}from some of the smaller
hamlets that surround the

60
00:06:34,565 --> 00:06:36,031
{\an1}Hidden Leaf Village.

61
00:06:36,398 --> 00:06:37,865
[gasp] Infants?!

62
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:40,865
{\an1}All told, we've confirmed
sixty kidnappings, and

63
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:43,198
{\an1}those are just the
ones we know of.

64
00:06:43,532 --> 00:06:44,331
Who would?!

65
00:06:44,365 --> 00:06:45,432
Indeed...

66
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:48,532
{\an1}Now, what I'm about to tell
you is merely hearsay...

67
00:06:49,398 --> 00:06:51,565
{\an1}But I believe that
someone is continuing the

68
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:54,331
{\an1}experiments and trying
to implant the cells of

69
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:56,031
Lord Hashirama.

70
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:58,731
{\an1}Even if they're rumors,
why would anyone--

71
00:06:58,764 --> 00:07:00,631
{\an1}There are those who
want to obtain every

72
00:07:00,664 --> 00:07:02,697
{\an1}jutsu that exists.

73
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:06,063
{\an1}At times, even I've wondered
how things would be if there

74
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:08,764
{\an1}were only someone who
knew Wood Style.

75
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,664
{\an1}Had that been the case,
then perhaps the Fourth

76
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,597
{\an1}Hokage need not have
sacrificed his life.

77
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:15,531
But...

78
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:16,464
[gasp]

79
00:07:18,097 --> 00:07:20,197
{\an1}To be frank, isn't
that one of the reasons

80
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,563
{\an1}why Lord Fourth lost
his life that night.

81
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,797
{\an1}Mind you, all of this is
nothing more than hearsay.

82
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,962
Hmm, but if...

83
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:34,730
{\an1}But if Lord Hashirama's
cells actually had been

84
00:07:34,763 --> 00:07:36,663
implanted into
those infants...

85
00:07:37,396 --> 00:07:39,897
{\an1}Implanting any cells
into infants is strictly

86
00:07:39,929 --> 00:07:41,929
{\an1}forbidden, of course.

87
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,228
{\an1}And even if someone were
to do so, the possibility of

88
00:07:45,262 --> 00:07:47,262
{\an1}success would be low.

89
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:54,362
However, perhaps
if one of the

90
00:07:54,395 --> 00:07:56,595
{\an1}first infants who
were kidnapped

91
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:59,562
{\an1}somehow managed to survive
such a procedure,

92
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:02,529
{\an1}they would be approximately
ten years old by now.

93
00:08:07,762 --> 00:08:08,961
Ten years old...

94
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,628
{\an1}Are you all here?

95
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:24,628
Yes, sir!

96
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:28,261
{\an1}Now then, tomorrow morning,
the Third Hokage and five

97
00:08:28,294 --> 00:08:31,194
{\an1}ANBU under his direct
command will depart

98
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:34,226
{\an1}the Leaf for the Feudal
Lord's prefecture.

99
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:37,560
{\an1}The objective he's after
is to retake his post

100
00:08:37,593 --> 00:08:40,326
{\an1}as Hokage now that
Lord Fourth's gone.

101
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:43,460
{\an1}If we allow this to
happen, the Hidden Leaf

102
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:46,026
{\an1}Village will once again
be forced to accept a

103
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,360
{\an1}weak and indecisive leader.

104
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:51,160
{\an1}For the sake of the
village, we must prevent

105
00:08:51,193 --> 00:08:53,226
{\an1}that at all costs.

106
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,692
{\an1}Therefore, your mission is
simple. Somewhere along

107
00:08:57,726 --> 00:09:00,759
{\an1}the route, take the life
of Lord Third quickly

108
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:02,559
and discreetly.

109
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:06,626
{\an1}But remember, this must be
kept secret. It must appear

110
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:10,125
{\an1}that it was the work
of rogue shinobi.

111
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,192
Understood?!

112
00:09:11,225 --> 00:09:12,092
Yes, sir!

113
00:09:22,324 --> 00:09:24,425
Lord Third?
Are you ready?

114
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:26,792
{\an1}I am. Let's depart!

115
00:10:06,424 --> 00:10:07,323
Enemy attack!

116
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:35,889
{\an1}Wood Style Jutsu!

117
00:10:36,954 --> 00:10:38,088
What?!

118
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:40,088
[groaning]

119
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:45,188
A Substitution?!

120
00:10:51,288 --> 00:10:51,988
Agh!

121
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:54,555
{\an1}Wood Style! Giant
Forest Jutsu!

122
00:11:01,654 --> 00:11:02,554
Chidori!

123
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,487
[grunt]

124
00:11:19,187 --> 00:11:22,052
You! Where did
you learn Wood Style?

125
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,386
I didn't expect
an answer anyway...

126
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:30,620
Go.

127
00:11:31,153 --> 00:11:32,052
Huh?

128
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:34,887
{\an1}Leave! Quickly! That jutsu
of yours will be critical to

129
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,753
{\an1}the Leaf Village one day.

130
00:11:51,485 --> 00:11:53,218
{\an1}It appears that they were
after Lord Third and Lord

131
00:11:53,252 --> 00:11:55,419
{\an1}Third alone. And it
seems that their

132
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:57,985
purpose was to
separate us from him.

133
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,951
{\an1}They all scattered
somewhere.

134
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:03,285
{\an1}Were you all right here?

135
00:12:03,318 --> 00:12:04,218
Yes.

136
00:12:04,752 --> 00:12:06,419
{\an1}Did you recognize
the enemy?

137
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:09,484
No... I don't
know who it was.

138
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:16,050
{\an1}Well, that's all right.

139
00:12:16,418 --> 00:12:18,351
{\an1}I'm sure Lord Third will
take care of the rest.

140
00:12:36,884 --> 00:12:39,517
{\an1}I regret to inform you
that I won't be giving

141
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,383
{\an1}up that seat just yet.

142
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:49,049
{\an1}It seems like you want to
ask me why I'm still alive.

143
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,750
{\an1}Of course not! I just
thought that you'd left this

144
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:54,450
{\an1}morning for the Feudal
Lord's prefecture.

145
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,616
{\an1}A certain someone
betrayed me.

146
00:12:56,982 --> 00:12:58,549
No, instead, he
came back to me

147
00:12:58,582 --> 00:13:01,616
{\an1}in order to warn me and
the others that we would be

148
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:04,549
{\an1}targeted on the way
to the prefecture.

149
00:13:07,816 --> 00:13:10,649
{\an1}I could easily find out
who was behind this.

150
00:13:11,015 --> 00:13:12,982
And that person
would be executed.

151
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,449
{\an1}That is as clear as day.

152
00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:24,281
{\an1}However, it's against my
principles to bring about

153
00:13:24,314 --> 00:13:25,648
any more death.

154
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:29,448
{\an1}If I could speak with that
person, I'd tell him...

155
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:33,947
{\an1}That I will overlook his
actions this one time.

156
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,381
{\an1}But in exchange, he
must do everything that

157
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:40,014
{\an1}is within his power.

158
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:42,747
For the sake of
Hidden Leaf Village.

159
00:13:45,046 --> 00:13:47,781
{\an1}[growl] You and your
absurd ideals of peace.

160
00:13:48,781 --> 00:13:51,547
{\an1}Your lukewarm naiveté
is certain to be your

161
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,913
{\an1}undoing one day, Hiruzen.

162
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:57,113
{\an1}Hmm. Perhaps you're right.

163
00:14:08,312 --> 00:14:10,112
{\an1}We've always been this way.

164
00:14:10,646 --> 00:14:14,513
{\an1}You are the light
and I am the darkness.

165
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:18,446
{\an1}Wherever there is light,
there is also darkness.

166
00:14:19,413 --> 00:14:22,312
{\an1}But losing either one
causes disruption and

167
00:14:22,346 --> 00:14:24,112
{\an1}imbalance in the world.

168
00:14:24,546 --> 00:14:25,446
{\an1}[harrumphing chuckle]

169
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:44,645
{\an1}Professor, I don't think I'm
qualified to be in the ANBU.

170
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:49,311
{\an1}Why is that? It is thanks
to you that I'm still alive.

171
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:52,612
Still, I nearly
betrayed you once.

172
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:53,678
Hmm...

173
00:14:55,043 --> 00:14:58,144
{\an1}I wasn't able to protect
the Fourth Hokage.

174
00:14:58,511 --> 00:15:01,010
{\an1}I wouldn't blame you if
you hate me for that.

175
00:15:03,144 --> 00:15:05,844
{\an1}You know, when Minato was
still alive, he came to talk

176
00:15:05,878 --> 00:15:07,411
to me about you.

177
00:15:07,744 --> 00:15:08,544
[gasp]

178
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:15,644
{\an1}I had hoped that he
could forget the pain

179
00:15:15,677 --> 00:15:18,243
{\an1}in his heart, even
just a little bit...

180
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:20,510
{\an1}That's why I assigned
him to the ANBU.

181
00:15:21,243 --> 00:15:24,976
{\an1}But based on the rumors that
I've heard about him lately...

182
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:28,976
{\an1}I'm afraid that I might've
just made his wounds deeper.

183
00:15:29,343 --> 00:15:31,209
{\an1}So now, I'm regretting it.

184
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,843
{\an1}Unfortunately, no one
can mend another's

185
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:37,176
wounded heart.

186
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:40,510
{\an1}Time is the only thing that
can truly heal all wounds.

187
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:42,609
Yes.

188
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,342
Well.

189
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,242
{\an1}There may be a solution...

190
00:15:47,242 --> 00:15:49,075
{\an1}Perhaps you could give
him the assignment

191
00:15:49,108 --> 00:15:50,442
{\an1}to guard Kushina.

192
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:53,175
{\an1}If he leaves his ANBU
duties to watch over

193
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,208
{\an1}someone who's about to
bring a new life into

194
00:15:55,242 --> 00:15:58,609
{\an1}the world, perhaps it will
trigger a change in him.

195
00:15:58,642 --> 00:16:00,041
You're right!

196
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,342
{\an1}When Minato died...

197
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:06,274
{\an1}For one fleeting moment, I
considered releasing you

198
00:16:06,307 --> 00:16:07,875
from the ANBU.

199
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:12,074
{\an1}But right now, I am in
great need of your strength.

200
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:13,574
Yes, sir!

201
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:16,974
{\an1}So, will you cotinue on as a
member of the ANBU, but one

202
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:19,107
{\an1}who reports directly to me?

203
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:20,307
Yes!

204
00:16:22,007 --> 00:16:25,274
{\an1}I just hope that Minato
will forgive me, as well.

205
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:32,173
{\an1}Lord Third, there's
something I need to tell you.

206
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:33,106
Hm?

207
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:35,973
{\an1}A Wood Style user's
in the Foundation.

208
00:16:37,106 --> 00:16:38,807
It's just as I
thought, then...

209
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:41,939
{\an1}I have a good idea
of who it must be...

210
00:16:42,306 --> 00:16:45,073
{\an1}Leave this situation
to me; I'll handle it.

211
00:16:45,607 --> 00:16:46,607
Yes, sir.

212
00:16:52,873 --> 00:16:55,506
{\an1}Ah, I see! So once
again, you will be

213
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:57,539
{\an1}filling the post,
Lord Third.

214
00:16:58,773 --> 00:17:00,639
{\an1}I am relieved to hear that.

215
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,205
{\an1}You already have the
experience and knowledge.

216
00:17:09,305 --> 00:17:11,105
Is that man not
here today?

217
00:17:12,139 --> 00:17:13,739
{\an1}You know who I mean,
that angry-looking

218
00:17:13,773 --> 00:17:15,639
one who has the
fearsome eye.

219
00:17:16,506 --> 00:17:18,338
Are you speaking
of Danzo, sir?

220
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,138
Yes, that's it!
He's the one!

221
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:23,872
{\an1}He had an urgent matter to
attend to, so he wasn't able

222
00:17:23,904 --> 00:17:25,937
{\an1}to be here with us today.

223
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:28,538
{\an1}Oh- oh, I see, good!

224
00:17:29,138 --> 00:17:31,838
{\an1}I just don't feel very
comfortable around him...

225
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,936
{\an1}We have to avoid any direct
contact between the two of

226
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,704
{\an1}us for the time being.

227
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,404
{\an1}Did something happen?

228
00:17:54,437 --> 00:17:56,704
{\an1}Kakashi has betrayed
me, and I believe

229
00:17:56,737 --> 00:18:00,103
{\an1}there's a possibility that
Hiruzen knows about us.

230
00:18:03,137 --> 00:18:04,870
That would not
be good at all.

231
00:18:05,803 --> 00:18:07,669
{\an1}In time, he might
learn all about this

232
00:18:07,703 --> 00:18:09,302
{\an1}place and its secrets.

233
00:18:11,803 --> 00:18:14,369
{\an1}Well, it is Lord Third;
he'll be on to us

234
00:18:14,403 --> 00:18:17,836
{\an1}eventually. He's probably
already guessed.

235
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:20,803
He must never
find out about us.

236
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:48,001
Kakashi...

237
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,367
[grunt]

238
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:24,466
{\an1}It won't come off!

239
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:34,032
{\an1}I heard that Lord
Third is reassuming

240
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:36,199
{\an1}the title of Hokage.

241
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:38,932
{\an1}I thought that this whole
changing of the guard thing

242
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:41,065
was gonna mean a
new era for the Leaf.

243
00:19:41,898 --> 00:19:44,599
{\an1}I know what you mean, Genma.
I thought the same thing.

244
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:47,332
{\an1}Hey... It's not going to be
easy for Lord Third, you

245
00:19:47,365 --> 00:19:49,298
{\an1}know! Not at his age!

246
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,565
{\an1}Well, we just have to
do our best for the

247
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,065
{\an1}village, that's all.

248
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:55,898
{\an1}I say that we celebrate the
return of Lord Third by

249
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:58,832
having some more
yummy dumplings!

250
00:19:58,866 --> 00:19:59,832
Yeah!

251
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:02,766
Huh?

252
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,563
{\an1}[nervous swallow]

253
00:20:42,697 --> 00:20:45,663
{\an1}Wait! It's just me!
It's Guy, Kakashi!

254
00:20:49,797 --> 00:20:50,797
Agh!

255
00:20:51,696 --> 00:20:53,329
You were really
out to get me!

256
00:20:53,763 --> 00:20:55,329
{\an1}I thought you were
gonna kill me!

257
00:20:56,629 --> 00:20:59,062
{\an1}Yeah, me, too. What the
hell were you thinking?!

258
00:20:59,696 --> 00:21:02,262
{\an1}I was just- I just
wanted to lure you into

259
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:05,028
continuing our
rivalry showdowns.

260
00:21:05,895 --> 00:21:08,462
