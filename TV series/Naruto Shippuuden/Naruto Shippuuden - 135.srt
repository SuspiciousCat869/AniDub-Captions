little brother.

SASUKE: Wow, Itachi.

3
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,533
You nailed every
target, even the one

4
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:50,433
in the blind spot
behind the rock.

5
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:51,533
All right.

6
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:53,233
Now it's my turn.

7
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:54,433
-No, Sasuke.

8
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:57,100
It's time to go.

-What happened to the
new shuriken jutsu

10
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,600
you promised to teach me, huh?

11
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:01,733
ITACHI: It'll have to wait.

12
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:03,800
I have an important
mission tomorrow.

13
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:06,000
I must prepare.

14
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,833
SASUKE: You're such
a big, fat liar.

15
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,733
-Sorry, Sasuke.

16
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:18,900
Maybe some other time.

17
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:21,833
-Ow!

18
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:25,300
OK, just watch this.

19
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,600
-Hey, be careful!

20
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:27,800
SASUKE: Ah Ow!

22
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:26,362
-How come the one who
twisted his ankle is

23
00:03:26,396 --> 00:03:28,262
the one who's laughing?

24
00:03:28,296 --> 00:03:30,062
Or maybe you were
just looking for a way

25
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:31,396
to get out of walking home.

26
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:32,462
-That's not it.

27
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:34,496
I just can't stop
thinking about how

28
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:36,396
I'm going to start at
the academy tomorrow.

29
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:38,429
Now I'll finally get
the chance to catch up

30
00:03:38,462 --> 00:03:41,362
to you, big brother.

[music playing]

32
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:52,329
-Itachi, have you
made up your mind yet?

33
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:55,829
If you haven't, then we will be
forced to take action instead.

34
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:56,796
-No, please wait.

35
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:58,429
I need more time.

36
00:03:58,462 --> 00:04:00,429
-It will be too late
once the players

37
00:04:00,462 --> 00:04:01,962
start to make their move.

38
00:04:01,996 --> 00:04:04,429
The situation's extremely dire.

39
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:06,162
ITACHI: I realize that.

40
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:10,562
I shall settle this
with my own hands.

41

FUGAKU: What?

42
00:04:11,462 --> 00:04:14,396
Do you know what
day tomorrow is?

43
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:18,496
I don't really think you
understand your position.

44
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,829
-I'm setting out on
a mission tomorrow.

45
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:22,562
-What are you talking about?

46
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,362
-I can't tell you that.

47
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:25,362
The mission is covert.

48
00:04:28,262 --> 00:04:32,529
-Itachi, you also serve as
the Uchiha clan's pipeline

49
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:35,362
to the village nerve center.

50
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:38,096
You know that, don't you?

51
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:39,562
-Yes.

52
00:04:39,596 --> 00:04:42,162
-Well, make sure
you don't forget it.

53
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:43,896
You will be at that
meeting tomorrow.

54
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:53,129
SASUKE: Father only
cares about you, Itachi.

55
00:04:56,662 --> 00:04:58,229
-You probably hate me, huh?

56
00:05:04,396 --> 00:05:06,129
It's all right.

57
00:05:06,162 --> 00:05:09,129
People often think
ill of shinobi.

58
00:05:09,162 --> 00:05:11,629
It's only logical.

59
00:05:11,662 --> 00:05:15,196
SASUKE: That's not how I feel.

60
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:17,696
-Being the best isn't all
it's cracked up to be.

61
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:20,629
When you have power, you
become arrogant and isolated

62
00:05:20,662 --> 00:05:23,229
from the world, no matter
how coveted and sought

63
00:05:23,262 --> 00:05:25,396
after you are in the beginning.

64
00:05:25,429 --> 00:05:27,962
But with us it's different
because you and I

65
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:29,762
are flesh and blood.

66
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,562
I'm always going to be
there for you, even if it's

67
00:05:32,596 --> 00:05:35,362
only as an obstacle
for you to overcome.

68
00:05:35,396 --> 00:05:38,429
Even if you do hate me.

69
00:05:38,462 --> 00:05:40,929
That's what big
brothers are for.

70
00:05:40,962 --> 00:05:42,596
YASHIRO: Is Itachi in there?

71
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:43,296
Come here.

72
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:44,229
We need to talk.

73
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:49,596
-What's wrong?

74
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:50,996
What are you all doing here?

75
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:52,429
YASHIRO: There
were two people who

76
00:05:52,462 --> 00:05:54,562
didn't show at
yesterday's assembly.

77
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:58,362
-Want to tell me why
you weren't there?

78
00:05:58,396 --> 00:06:00,229
You're in the ANBU
black ops now.

79
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:01,829
I know full well you
can be called away

80
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,096
at the drop of a hat.

81
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,562
And that's the case
your father was

82
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:07,129
trying to make when we
asked why you weren't there.

83
00:06:07,162 --> 00:06:10,029
-But we're not him, so you
won't get any special treatment

84
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:12,129
from us.

85
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:13,162
-I understand.

86
00:06:13,196 --> 00:06:15,029
Guess I should have
been more careful.

87
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:17,696
Will that be all, gentlemen?

88
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:19,396
-Yeah, sure thing.

89
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:20,529
But you know what?

90
00:06:20,562 --> 00:06:23,729
Before we go, there's
just one other thing.

91
00:06:23,762 --> 00:06:26,396
Know anything about
Shisui Uchiha?

92
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:30,062
He killed himself
in Nakano River.

93
00:06:30,096 --> 00:06:31,296
-It's funny.

94
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:33,362
If I remember correctly,
you kind of looked up to him

95
00:06:33,396 --> 00:06:35,962
like an older
brother, didn't you?

96
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,062
-How terrible.

97
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:38,996
Forgive me.

98
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:41,596
I haven't seen him
at all recently.

99
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:42,462
What a tragedy.

100
00:06:47,062 --> 00:06:47,996
-Yeah.

101
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:49,229
Well at this point,
the police force

102
00:06:49,262 --> 00:06:50,696
sees no other
choice but to launch

103
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:52,296
an all-out investigation.

104
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:52,796
-What?

105
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:58,062
-This is a note
Shisui left behind.

106
00:06:58,096 --> 00:06:59,996
We've already had
it fully analyzed.

107
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:03,562
There's no question
this is his handwriting.

108
00:07:03,596 --> 00:07:05,029
ITACHI: But if it
wasn't homicide,

109
00:07:05,062 --> 00:07:07,196
why the investigation?

110
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:08,862
-It would be no great
feat for someone

111
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:12,162
who possesses Sharingan
to copy his handwriting.

112
00:07:12,196 --> 00:07:14,062
YASHIRO: The most
talented of all our clan,

113
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:16,396
feared as Shisui the Teleporter.

114
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:19,296
He was a man who would do
anything, take any mission,

115
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:21,496
if it was for the
good of the clan.

116
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:24,796
-Hard to imagine a man like
that throwing everything away,

117
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:25,662
don't you think?

118
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:30,462
-You shouldn't
judge by appearances

119
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:33,629
or by your own
preconceptions, either.

120
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,196
-We'll leave that
with you for now.

121
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:37,729
Take it to ANBU black ops
and put in a request for them

122
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:40,362
to start sniffing
around on this, too.

123
00:07:40,396 --> 00:07:43,029
ITACHI: Understood.

124
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:46,129
-Let's just hope we get
a lead on this soon.

125
00:07:46,162 --> 00:07:48,196
ITACHI: Why don't you
just come out and say it?

126
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:55,762
You believe I had a
hand in this, don't you?

127
00:07:55,796 --> 00:07:58,296
-Yeah, that's
right, little punk.

128
00:07:58,329 --> 00:07:59,729
[fighting sounds]

129
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:08,962
-Like I said before,
appearances and preconceptions

130
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:12,296
aren't going to
tell you anything.

131
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:14,329
For instance, you've
made the mistake

132
00:08:14,362 --> 00:08:16,629
of assuming I'm a patient man.

133
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:21,029
The clan, the clan-- you
overestimate your own abilities

134
00:08:21,062 --> 00:08:24,162
with no idea of the
depth of my own.

135
00:08:24,196 --> 00:08:27,662
And look at you now,
grovelling in the dirt.

136
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:31,862
-Shisui had been keeping
an eye on you recently.

137
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:35,362
The strangeness of your behavior
happening during your time

138
00:08:35,396 --> 00:08:37,362
at ANBU couldn't get overlooked.

139
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:40,396
What are you playing at,
you filthy little wretch.

140
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:44,362
-Obsessed with the organization,
obsessed with the clan,

141
00:08:44,396 --> 00:08:46,262
obsessed with our lineage.

142
00:08:46,296 --> 00:08:49,329
A worthless compulsion
that enslaves us.

143
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,729
All it does is limit
our capabilities.

144
00:08:51,762 --> 00:08:55,262
And that, in turn, leads us to
fear what you don't understand.

145
00:08:55,296 --> 00:08:56,762
FUGAKU: Stop it, Itachi!

146
00:08:56,796 --> 00:08:58,362
That is enough.

147
00:08:58,396 --> 00:09:00,762
What on earth is
the matter with you?

148
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:04,062
Itachi, you've been
strange lately.

149
00:09:04,096 --> 00:09:06,429
ITACHI: Nothing
strange about me.

150
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:10,029
I have my own duties
to fulfill, that's all.

151
00:09:10,062 --> 00:09:13,462
-So why didn't you
come last night, then?

152
00:09:13,496 --> 00:09:16,829
-To reach the next level.

153
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:18,129
-What are you talking about?

154
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,296
-I have had enough of this.

155
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,196
There's no hope left
for this pathetic clan.

156
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:29,096
The people of this
clan are all the same.

157
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:30,996
You focus on the
trivial and lose sight

158
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,029
of what's most important.

159
00:09:33,062 --> 00:09:36,496
Change is impossible in
this fog of ignorance.

160
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:38,529
How can we evolve
when regulation

161
00:09:38,562 --> 00:09:40,596
is the only thing
we've ever known?

162
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:41,829
-Such arrogance!

163
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:42,896
-That's enough.

164
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:45,162
If I hear one more
word of this nonsense,

165
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:46,996
I'll have you
thrown behind bars!

166
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:48,629
Well?

167
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:49,696
What's it gonna be?

168
00:09:49,729 --> 00:09:51,762
-I can't take this anymore.

169
00:09:51,796 --> 00:09:55,129
Please, sir, just
give me the order.

170
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,196
SASUKE: Big brother!

171
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,229
You have to stop!

172
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:12,196
-I'm not the one
who killed Shisui,

173
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:15,396
but I apologize for the
words I have spoken.

174
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:17,562
I'm truly sorry.

175
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:19,996
-Well, I guess he has
been pretty tired lately.

176
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:22,729
Up to his ears in missions
from the ANBU black ops.

177
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:24,129
-But Captain.

178
00:10:24,162 --> 00:10:27,829
FUGAKU: ANBU are under the
direct control of the Hokage.

179
00:10:27,862 --> 00:10:29,829
Even if you wanted to
arrest one of them,

180
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,662
you would need to
get a warrant first.

181
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:38,262
As for Itachi, I take full
responsibility for him.

182
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:39,029
You've my word.

183
00:10:41,962 --> 00:10:44,029
-Very well, sir.

184
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:44,962
-Inside, Itach.

185
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,676
MIKOTO: Itachi?

186
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,376
I'll just leave your food here.

187
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:20,143
I know you're busy
with work, but I really

188
00:11:20,176 --> 00:11:22,610
wish you'd join us for
a meal once in a while.

189
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:29,810
-Thank you, Mother.

00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,176
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
I shouldn't have

191
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,810
stayed to practice
with my shuriken.

192
00:12:01,843 --> 00:12:02,910
Now I'm totally late.

193
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:09,476
What was that?

194
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,276
I could have sworn
there was someone there.

195
00:12:14,576 --> 00:12:18,110
What is this?

196
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:19,110
Oh, no.

197
00:12:19,143 --> 00:12:20,110
Father and Mother!

198
00:12:32,576 --> 00:12:34,043
-Big brother!

199
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:38,476
Father and Mother are
both-- I don't understand!

200
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,110
Just who could do
something like this?

201
00:12:42,143 --> 00:12:45,076
-My foolish little brother.

202
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,076
Mangekyo Sharingan.

203
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,510
-He's a worthy son.

204
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:04,010
-All our father ever
talks about is you.

205
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:09,010
-No!

206
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:13,943
Stop it!

207
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:16,943
Itachi, why are you
showing me all this!

208
00:13:28,443 --> 00:13:31,410
Why?

209
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,410
Why did you do this?

210
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:35,910
Itachi, why?

211
00:13:35,943 --> 00:13:39,410
-To test the limits
of my ability.

212
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,643
SASUKE: To test your ability.

213
00:13:41,676 --> 00:13:43,510
That's why you did this?

214
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:46,576
You're telling me that that was
the reason that you butchered

215
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,676
every single member of our clan.

216
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,243
-It is of great importance.

217
00:14:18,576 --> 00:14:19,643
-No.

218
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:21,310
This isn't like
you, big brother.

219
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:22,776
It's not.

220
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,443
-I have acted like
the older brother

221
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:27,410
you desired for one
reason-- because I wanted

222
00:14:27,443 --> 00:14:30,343
to discover how
powerful you were.

223
00:14:30,376 --> 00:14:32,310
I needed to find
a worthy opponent

224
00:14:32,343 --> 00:14:34,710
to test the limits
of my own abilities.

225
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:37,643
You have that unique potential.

226
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,876
Now I've made you hate me.

227
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,343
Now you have the
desire to defeat me,

228
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:45,443
which is exactly why I'm
going to allow you to live.

229
00:14:45,476 --> 00:14:46,443
Don't you see?

230
00:14:46,476 --> 00:14:48,610
It's all for my own benefit.

231
00:14:48,643 --> 00:14:51,176
Just like me, you may be
one of the few people who

232
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,643
are able to use
Mangekyo Sharingan.

233
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:56,210
However, there is
one big catch to it.

234
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:02,510
Take the life of
your best friend.

235
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:05,943
You must kill him.

236
00:15:05,976 --> 00:15:07,076
Kill him just like I did.

237
00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:14,576
-You're saying that
was you, Itachi?

238
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,443
You killed Shisui?

239
00:15:16,476 --> 00:15:17,376
-I did.

240
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,810
That's how I
obtained these eyes.

241
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:22,776
In the main hall
of Nakano Shrine,

242
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,243
underneath the seventh
tatami mat from the far right

243
00:15:26,276 --> 00:15:28,676
is the clan's secret
gathering place.

244
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,910
There you will find
a secret document,

245
00:15:30,943 --> 00:15:34,476
an explanation of the
Uchiha clan's jutsu.

246
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,610
It tells of the visual
jutsu's true purpose.

247
00:15:38,643 --> 00:15:40,443
If you discover
how to activate it,

248
00:15:40,476 --> 00:15:43,076
you will be the third person
to obtain the Mangekyo

249
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,776
Sharingan, including myself.

250
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:50,243
To ensure that happens, that's
enough reason to let you live.

251
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,410
Oh, don't worry, Sasuke.

252
00:15:55,443 --> 00:15:58,876
You're not worth killing.

253
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:03,643
If you wish to kill me one
day, in hate and revenge,

254
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:08,310
surviving in such an unsightened
manner as this, by all means,

255
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,276
flee.

256
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,243
Cling to your wretched life.

257
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:17,776
And then, one day, when
you possess the same eyes,

258
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,310
come back and face me.

259
00:16:19,343 --> 00:16:22,176
[music playing]

260
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:44,410
How much can you see it with
those Sharingan of yours?

261
00:16:44,443 --> 00:16:47,143
SASUKE: How much can
I see with these?

262
00:16:47,176 --> 00:16:53,610
What I'm seeing right now,
Itachi, is you dead at my feet.

263
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,176
-You see me dead, do you?

264
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:13,076
Well, then, go on,
make it happen.

265
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:42,143
-Chidori.

00:18:08,176 --> 00:18:11,410
-You have gotten strong.

268
00:18:11,443 --> 00:18:13,443
-Listen close, Itachi.

269
00:18:13,476 --> 00:18:15,743
I have one final
thing to ask of you.

270

[music playing]

271
00:18:51,676 --> 00:18:55,276
-The exact same words as
before, and the crows, as well.

Starting with your favorite
genjutsu farce, huh?

273
00:18:58,276 --> 00:19:00,476
-So what do you want to know?

274
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,910
It won't be the last thing, but
I'll hear what you have to say.

275
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,310
-Let me try this again.

276

-Genjutsu.

277
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,310
SASUKE: I have one
last thing to ask.

278
00:19:33,343 --> 00:19:36,610
You hear me, you bastard?

279
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:37,910
Answer my question.

280
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:41,676
The pain in your chest
won't stop until you do.

281
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,576
-You deliberately
avoided a vital spot.

282
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,610
-Remember what you said?

283
00:19:47,643 --> 00:19:49,410
-If you discover
how to activate it,

284

you will be the third person
to obtain the Mangekyo

To ensure that happens, that's
enough reason to let you live.

00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,110
-The third one, the other
one with that Sharingan,

288
00:20:03,143 --> 00:20:07,010
who in the Uchiha
clan obtained it?

-But why?

290
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:11,476
Why do you even concern
yourself with such a thing?

291
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,143
-I'm going to go
kill him after you.

292
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:17,010
That is why.

293
00:20:17,043 --> 00:20:18,810
-Kill him?

294
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:21,710
-Back when you slaughtered
our entire clan,

295
00:20:21,743 --> 00:20:25,176
you mentioned the
existence of another.

296
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,743
The other Uchiha
that you didn't kill,

297
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:31,776
he must have been a
co-conspirator because even

298
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:36,876
you couldn't have taken down
the Leaf Police Force alone.

299

SASUKE: Who is it?

301

-Madara Uchiha.

00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,876
-With that vision of
yours and a chakra

00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,810
more ominous than my own,
you're the spitting image

of Madara Uchiha
from the elder days.

Am I supposed to care?
