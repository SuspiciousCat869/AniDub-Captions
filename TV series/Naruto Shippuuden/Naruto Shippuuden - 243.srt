1
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:16,041
{\an1}<i>[Tsunade]</i>
<i>They should be arriving soon.</i>

2
00:00:16,742 --> 00:00:17,877
Do you mean Naruto?

3
00:00:18,713 --> 00:00:19,347
Yes.

4
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:25,322
{\an1}The Raikage wouldn't disclose
the location, but he said it was
the ideal place to lay low.

5
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:30,163
Now if only Naruto will
do as he's told and stay
hidden during the war.

6
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:36,906
{\an4}But knowing his nature, once he
learns that fighting has broken
out, he's going to want to rush
right onto the battlefield.

7
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:41,047
{\an1}I told Naruto he was going
on a highly classified
S-rank mission.

8
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:44,319
{\an1}Don't worry, the others
will follow along and
play their parts.

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,726
{\an1}Octopus, octopus, octopus!

10
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,327
<i>[Yamato]</i>
<i>Octopus?</i>

11
00:00:50,895 --> 00:00:54,100
{\an1}Yeah, it's supposed to give
me guidance, remember?
Giant Gramps Sage foretold it!

12
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:59,842
{\an1}Now, Naruto. I've had a
prophecy about you.

13
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:04,250
{\an1}Soon you will be
meeting an octopus.

14
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:07,789
{\an1}So where is this thing? Can't
you give me any more clues?

15
00:01:08,122 --> 00:01:13,964
{\an1}It's not clear, but it's an
island. avoided by people.
A creature's paradise.

16
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:17,470
{\an1}It seems a veritable
pleasure resort to me!

17
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:23,079
{\an1}<i>I believe that is where the</i>
<i>octopus will cooperate with you.</i>

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,949
{\an1}In any case, you'll
receive guidance there.

19
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,356
{\an1}Oh, yeah.
That octopus.

20
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:33,161
{\an1}I mean he's right about
this place being an
isolated island paradise!

21
00:01:33,395 --> 00:01:35,865
So he must be right
about meeting someone
that'll help me!

22
00:01:37,468 --> 00:01:40,105
{\an7}<i>Good. It looks like Naruto</i>
<i>hasn't caught on yet.</i>

23
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:44,512
All right! Please get
ready to disembark now!

24
00:01:45,046 --> 00:01:47,517
Hey! The island's
coming into view!

25
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,786
{\an1}Paradise, here I come!

26
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:09,819
{\an1}That's...
a paradise...?!

27
00:02:10,152 --> 00:02:12,288
{\an1}It's like the
Hidden Leaf's
Forest of Death.

28
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,759
{\an1}Although perhaps
a whole lot flashier.

29
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,395
No resort?

30
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:18,598
{\an1}Don't worry. It's safe here.

31
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:23,373
{\an4}Just remember: as long
as you don't provoke
them, the creatures here
will leave you alone.

32
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:24,875
{\an1}Well, except for...

33
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:26,745
"Except for...?"
Except what?!

34
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:30,751
{\an5}What part of this
place is a paradise??
You stink, Giant
Gramps Sage!

35
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,554
{\an1}It lives along the shore.

36
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:34,423
Hm?

37
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:36,726
{\an1}Yeeah!
Octopus tentacles!

38
00:02:37,495 --> 00:02:37,862
Uhh...

39
00:02:38,996 --> 00:02:42,268
{\an1}Okay, octopus!
I made it here!
So come on and guide me!

40
00:02:42,302 --> 00:02:44,305
Naruto,
that's actually...

41
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:49,446
A squid!

42
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:36,947
"Land Ahoy! Is This the
Island of Paradise?"

43
00:04:39,785 --> 00:04:40,753
Huh.

44
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:45,927
{\an4}It's him! I was just about
to warn you that he's the
only one that you have to
be careful of!

45
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:46,996
What's that?
What?

46
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:49,600
{\an1}One, two, three, four...

47
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:52,972
{\an5}You don't need to
count its tentacles!
You can tell just by
looking, Naruto!

48
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,476
{\an1}I don't know; I think
we should make sure.

49
00:04:56,511 --> 00:04:59,415
{\an1}A squid has ten legs.
An octopus has eight.

50
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:02,486
{\an1}If this is the octopus who'll
guide me, I gotta know!

51
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,722
Uwhaaa...

52
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:04,523
Yaaah!

53
00:05:04,556 --> 00:05:05,357
{\an1}<i>Naruto!</i>

54
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:07,226
Whoaaaaa!

55
00:05:07,461 --> 00:05:08,163
Hm!

56
00:05:09,597 --> 00:05:10,598
Gyaah!

57
00:05:12,102 --> 00:05:15,440
<i>[Killer Bee]</i>
<i>Squid go deviate!</i>
<i>The rest I abbreviate!</i>

58
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:20,280
{\an1}What is this?! Here
comes another one now,
spouting off weird rhymes!

59
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:22,317
All of us are
done for!

60
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:24,955
{\an1}That's six. And seven.
And eight...

61
00:05:25,756 --> 00:05:26,724
It's an octopus!

62
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:28,728
{\an1}This one's
an octopus!

63
00:05:29,227 --> 00:05:30,429
{\an1}It is?
You sure?

64
00:05:34,903 --> 00:05:35,972
It's Lord
Killer Bee!

65
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:38,843
{\an1}It's Killer Bee?
This octopus is...

66
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:42,682
{\an1}All y'all are late!
Ya hear, fools, ya fools?

67
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,092
It's really
a person?!

68
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:51,562
{\an1}Hey, Octopops!
Thanks, ya know!

69
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,766
"Ya know" huh?

70
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,571
What is he..?

71
00:05:57,773 --> 00:05:58,573
{\an1}Hmm?

72
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,578
<i>Killer Bee...</i>
<i>That's me...</i>
<i>ya know!</i>

73
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:05,017
I don't want to be rash,
but will we clash
or be a smash?

74
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,089
If I dare say,
it'll be a no-go,
whee!

75
00:06:08,122 --> 00:06:12,228
I'm a brat-hating
outlaw, yeeeeeuhhh!

76
00:06:12,495 --> 00:06:16,300
{\an1}Who the hell is this
shades-wearing meathead
with the weird rhymes?

77
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:19,505
{\an7}<i>This geezer is my</i>
<i>octopus mentor?!</i>

78
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:21,109
They're not
weird rhymes.

79
00:06:21,643 --> 00:06:25,615
This is his own original
style, a combination
of Enka and rap.

80
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:27,084
It's Enka Rap!

81
00:06:27,118 --> 00:06:28,486
{\an1}That doesn't make
sense at all.

82
00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:33,594
{\an1}<i>Glad you made it in one piece.</i>
<i>I've been waiting for you.</i>

83
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:38,068
{\an1}I am Supervisor Motoi. Welcome!

84
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:41,207
{\an1}I'll show you your rooms.
Follow me.

85
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:45,513
{\an1}Unhh. Have we
finally arrived?

86
00:06:46,215 --> 00:06:49,320
Yes, we've landed.
So get yourself
together.

87
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:50,421
Ohh...

88
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:54,527
Bushier Brow Sensei...
Are you okay?

89
00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:58,666
{\an1}He never really found
his sea legs, did he?

90
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:01,037
We were at sea
for quite a while.

91
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,910
{\an1}It sure was long.
[hurf]
And so painful.

92
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:16,262
this is not
exactly what I'd
call "paradise".

93
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:19,599
Huagh. I still
feel woozy.

94
00:07:20,268 --> 00:07:21,535
Raaaaah!

95
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:22,704
Aaah!

96
00:07:22,738 --> 00:07:23,605
[retching]

97
00:07:24,674 --> 00:07:27,044
{\an1}Stand down, there, King!
These guys are with me.

98
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:28,280
Huh?

99
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:29,782
Mmm!

100
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:30,950
{\an1}A giant
gorilla?!

101
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,121
{\an1}That's...
a gorilla?!

102
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:38,662
{\an1}Master Bee stands atop the
island's hierarchy of beasts.
He's tamed every one of them.

103
00:07:39,597 --> 00:07:43,169
{\an1}So as long as he remains here,
this place will offer
you no danger.

104
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:48,811
{\an1}<i>Also, preeminent Hidden Cloud</i>
<i>shinobi maintain a barrier</i>
<i>around the island. </i>

105
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:52,016
{\an1}We'll know immediately if
anything suspicious approaches.

106
00:07:53,986 --> 00:07:56,456
{\an7}<i>Which is why this place was</i>
<i>selected to hold them...</i>

{\an1}What the heck is up with that
shades-wearing pops, anyway?

108
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:03,133
{\an1}He's the Hidden
Cloud Village's
hero among heroes.

109
00:08:03,802 --> 00:08:04,402
Hero?

110
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:09,978
{\an4}<i>He's someone who not only</i>
<i>tamed these beasts, but also</i>
<i>has the Eight-Tails</i>
<i>perfectly under his control.</i>

{\an1}The Eight-Tails' Jinchuriki?

114
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:22,230
{\an1}And... he can control it?
That old Octopops?!

115
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:24,734
{\an1}He's Master Killer Bee.

Yo!

117
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:31,578

where he trained in
order to gain control
over the Eight-Tails.

{\an3}Huh?

There are rooms enough
for all of you.

You can eat whenever you want.

00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:39,543
Hee hee...

146
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:43,849
{\an1}You know something, kid?
You've got pretty good style.

147
00:10:44,418 --> 00:10:46,554
{\an8}<i>Yes! He's starting</i>
<i>to like me!</i>

148
00:10:47,323 --> 00:10:47,855
<i>Yo!</i>

149
00:10:48,658 --> 00:10:49,326
Huh?

150
00:10:50,661 --> 00:10:53,432
{\an1}First comes the greeting!
So we start it all off with
a fist bump.

151
00:10:53,465 --> 00:10:55,134
{\an1}And then you
keep rapping.

152
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:56,736
Uhh...

153
00:10:58,607 --> 00:11:01,143
{\an1}Octopops with sun-spects,
ya seem suspect-

154
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,346
Ahh?

155
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,417
{\an8}<i>Oh, crud! Shouldn't</i>
<i>have said that!</i>

156
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,454
{\an7}<i>Oh well, what the heck!</i>

157
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:09,890
Harem Jutsu!

158
00:11:11,994 --> 00:11:14,698
See, I'm begging on my
knees, full of respect.

159
00:11:14,732 --> 00:11:16,066
{\an1}I'm a good prospect!

160
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,504
{\an1}Let's put the
training to effect!

161
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:22,477
So... help me, please...

162
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:28,587
{\an7}<i>What do you think?</i>
<i>Best jutsu ever, right? Eh?</i>

163
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:30,757
Aahh!

164
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:36,164
Hey, Octopops!
What gives?

165
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:38,568
Meanie!

166
00:11:41,973 --> 00:11:45,646
{\an7}<i>What's his deal?!</i>
<i>Making up weird</i>
<i>rhymes all the time!</i>

167
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:48,718
{\an7}<i>I bet some other octopus</i>
<i>is the real one!</i>

168
00:11:50,421 --> 00:11:50,887
What is it?

169
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:55,828
{\an4}I want you to teach me all
the drills that octopops
used to gain control over
the Eight-Tails.

170
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:58,099
{\an1}He trained on this island,
didn't he?

171
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:01,070
Oh. You mean Master Bee.

172
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:06,111
{\an4}Yeah! That guy won't
give me the time of day,
so I decided to come to
you instead!

173
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,480
To me?

174
00:12:08,682 --> 00:12:10,552
{\an1}I don't care if he's some big
hero of the Hidden Cloud!

175
00:12:11,086 --> 00:12:14,123
{\an1}He's mean and stubborn, and
all he does is talk in rhymes.

176
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:19,031
{\an4}We're both Jinchuriki,
so you'd think he'd be
more understanding
about my situation!

177
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:21,901
You don't know a damn
thing about Master Bee!

178
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:24,906
{\an1}Now I suggest you shut
your mouth before you say
something you regret!

179
00:12:25,308 --> 00:12:26,443
{\an1}[stunned]

180
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,517
{\an1}If you're also a Jinchuriki...
you know what it's like to
live with that burden.

181
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,320
{\an1}Tell me, isn't that true?

182
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,923
{\an1}Yeah, I do know
all about it.

183
00:12:35,957 --> 00:12:39,397
{\an1}And he should be able
to understand what it's
been like for me, too!

184
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:45,071
{\an1}So I don't see why won't he give
me a break and help me out!
I just...

185
00:12:51,915 --> 00:12:54,386
{\an1}Don't worry, Master Bee's
been watching over you.

186
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,656
I'm sure there's a
reason he did this.

187
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:57,558
Huh?

188
00:12:58,426 --> 00:13:00,929
{\an1}Listen; did you
exchange greetings?

189
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:02,599
Exchange wha?

190
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:06,739
{\an1}First comes the greeting!
So we start it all off
with a fist bump.

191
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,179
{\an1}Well, we did this, uh,
whatchamacallit...
fist bump?

192
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,121
Good. Naruto, right?
Come, follow me.

193
00:13:17,456 --> 00:13:18,156
{\an1}Uh... why?

194
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:20,794
I'll take you to Master
Bee's training grounds.

195
00:13:21,562 --> 00:13:22,196
All right!

196
00:13:22,697 --> 00:13:23,933
{\an1}<i>[Yamato]</i>
<i>Then I'll tag along.</i>

197
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:24,433
Huh?

198
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:26,336
<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Captain Yamato?!</i>

199
00:13:27,537 --> 00:13:30,309
{\an1}I'm a Wood-Style user, and I'm
supposed to look after Naruto.

200
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,647
Oh! Yes, I've
heard of you.

201
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:35,149
Very well.

202
00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:47,468
<i>[Aoba]</i>
<i>I brought you</i>
<i>some water.</i>

203
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:49,706
{\an1}Oh... thanks for that.

204
00:13:51,475 --> 00:13:52,811
{\an1}Are you feeling any better?

205
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:56,717
{\an1}Kinda. I do feel like I'm
starting to recover though.

206
00:13:57,251 --> 00:14:01,123
{\an1}But it's as if I can't quite
seem to shake the feeling
that I'm still at sea.

207
00:14:01,524 --> 00:14:03,059
{\an1}Is it my imagination?

208
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:06,565
Hmm. Yep, it's
in your head.

209
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,543
Is this it?

210
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:17,682
Yes. This place is
called the
Waterfall of Truth.

211
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:19,853
{\an1}The Waterfall
of Truth?

212
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:22,456
He learned to control
his Tailed Beast here?

213
00:14:23,391 --> 00:14:25,360
{\an1}Not quite.
It is just the
first step.

214
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:26,696
<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Huh?</i>

215
00:14:27,898 --> 00:14:30,402
{\an1}Sit down here and close
your eyes, Naruto.

216
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:32,773
And you will see
your true self.

217
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,576
{\an1}See my true self?

218
00:14:35,243 --> 00:14:35,945
That's right.

219
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:57,210
{\an8}<i>Why?</i>

220
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,211
Hmm?

221
00:14:59,948 --> 00:15:01,718
{\an1}<i>[Dark Naruto]</i>
<i>Why didn't you give them</i>
<i>your autograph at Ichiraku?</i>

222
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:04,254
What's that?

223
00:15:05,255 --> 00:15:07,125
{\an1}Can't blame you, you know.

224
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:10,999
{\an1}I mean, after all,
they came kissing up
to you like that.

225
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:13,702
[gasp]

226
00:15:14,738 --> 00:15:17,241
{\an1}They were completely
disgusting, weren't they?

227
00:15:27,256 --> 00:15:29,327
{\an8}<i>He looks just like me!</i>

228
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:31,998
{\an1}Don't you remember?

229
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:36,438
{\an1}Everyone in the village used
to treat us like outcasts,
and then they try to pull that?

230
00:15:40,044 --> 00:15:42,247
{\an1}Oh, that's right!
Can I get your
autograph?

231
00:15:42,782 --> 00:15:47,021
{\an1}And if you don't mind, could
you make it out to my kid,
please? He's a real big fan!

232
00:15:48,057 --> 00:15:49,224
Autograph?

233
00:15:49,558 --> 00:15:51,394
You're the hero of
the Hidden Leaf!

234
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:53,699
Naruto, the kid who
makes miracles!

235
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:56,970
Can I please have
your autograph, too?

236
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,706
{\an1}<i>What? Can't you do it?</i>

237
00:15:58,907 --> 00:16:02,179
No, it's not that;
I'm just not used to
this celebrity thing.

238
00:16:02,611 --> 00:16:04,514
I've never given an
autograph before!

239
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,586
Who the hell are you?

240
00:16:08,454 --> 00:16:11,860
{\an1}Isn't it obvious?
Come on!
I'm you!

241
00:16:11,893 --> 00:16:15,666
What? That can't be.
I haven't made any
Shadow Clones!

242
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:18,369
{\an1}I'm no clone;
I'm the real you.

243
00:16:18,403 --> 00:16:22,476
{\an1}The one that exists
inside your heart.
You see, I am you!

244
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:24,512
What are you even
talking about?

245
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:28,552
{\an1}I have no idea who you are.
Now just stop making stuff up!

246
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:33,526
{\an1}Naruto. Hey!

247
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,294
No, quiet!

248
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:38,267
{\an1}So they call this place
the Waterfall of Truth?

249
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:44,409
{\an1}I never thought I'd be able to
emerge completely like this.
I like this place.

250
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:45,612
Rgh.

251
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:49,919
{\an1}Anyway, I'm the truth that
you're supposed to face.

252
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:52,623
{\an1}I'm the real you,
your true self inside.

253
00:16:52,856 --> 00:16:54,692
The real me? But...

254
00:16:55,961 --> 00:17:01,303
{\an1}Yeah. I'm the hatred
that's inside you.
I'm the dark part of you.

255
00:17:01,904 --> 00:17:02,371
[gasp]

256
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,509
The only difference
between us,

257
00:17:06,812 --> 00:17:10,751
{\an1}Is that the Nine Tails has taken
a really serious liking to me.

258
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:12,922
Then you...

259
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:19,631
{\an1}The Nine Tails' will is a mass
of hatred that's bound tightly
to his chakra by strong forces.

260
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:26,909
{\an4}No matter how hard you try to
shield yourself, it will find
some hatred buried deep inside
you and try to take over.

261
00:17:27,811 --> 00:17:30,282
{\an8}<i>So he's the one working</i>
<i>with the Nine Tails.</i>

262
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,252
{\an1}Yeah, you got
that right.

263
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,256
{\an1}Just face it: I'm
the real one here.

264
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:38,061
{\an1}And I'm not going to let
you kick me out, you fake!

265
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:40,297
{\an1}So that's how it is, huh?

266
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:52,817
You're the fake one.
And I'm gonna prove it!

267
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,827
[growling]

268
00:18:00,795 --> 00:18:02,598
[growl]

269
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:03,967
Come on; any time, now.

270
00:18:07,472 --> 00:18:09,776
[roar]

271
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:26,535
{\an1}On this island, I'm top dog,
taking y'all down like a
whirlwind clearing the fog!

272
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:27,671
Yea-ah!

273
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:30,474
You've still got a
ways to go, Kintoki.

274
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,544
Mraaah.

275
00:18:34,682 --> 00:18:39,156
{\an4}Hey, Bee. If you have the
time to play around, you
could have looked after that
Nine Tails kid, you know?

276
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,528
{\an1}After all, Jinchuriki ought
to stick together, right?

277
00:18:43,862 --> 00:18:48,002
I don't really care for
the Nine Tails, but that
kid's got potential.

278
00:18:49,705 --> 00:18:54,279
{\an1}I was crazy wild too, once.
But we met, and look at me now.

279
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,749
Plus, he kinda
reminds me of you--

280
00:18:56,782 --> 00:18:58,652
{\an1}My rap says shut your trap!

281
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:02,091
{\an1}And I ain't acknowledging no
rap-mocking "ya know" fool!

282
00:19:03,026 --> 00:19:04,462
{\an1}And besides, he...

283
00:19:07,699 --> 00:19:12,073
[panting]

284
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:13,641
Damn it!

285
00:19:14,877 --> 00:19:18,417
{\an7}<i>We have the exact same strength.</i>
<i>This is never going to end!</i>

286
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:22,923
{\an1}Accept it, there's no way you
can beat me. Not ever.

287
00:19:23,824 --> 00:19:24,860
Egh!

288
00:19:25,594 --> 00:19:27,498
{\an1}Then I'll overwhelm
you with numbers!

289
00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:29,299
{\an1}Shadow Clone Jutsu!

290
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,374
{\an1}Shadow Clone Jutsu!

291
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:38,947
{\an1}Aw, what the hell?!
I can't believe this!

292
00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:41,619
{\an1}We even make the same
amount of Shadow Clones!

293
00:19:42,254 --> 00:19:44,323
{\an1}Hey, you're pretty sharp,
figuring that out.

294
00:19:44,957 --> 00:19:45,925
That's it!

295
00:19:47,661 --> 00:19:48,496
Go!

296
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:50,266
Go!

297
00:19:52,102 --> 00:19:54,072
{\an1}I don't understand.
What's going on?

298
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:57,010
{\an1}When one sits before
the waterfall,

299
00:19:57,043 --> 00:20:00,215
{\an1}one can focus and enter
one's own mental sphere.

300
00:20:00,581 --> 00:20:04,388
{\an1}And the waterfall
becomes the mirror that
reflects your true self.

301
00:20:04,822 --> 00:20:06,858
{\an1}It is a truly
mystical place.

302
00:20:08,494 --> 00:20:12,100
So right now,
Naruto is battling
against himself.

303
00:20:22,983 --> 00:20:23,650
Rasen...!

304
00:20:23,684 --> 00:20:24,219
...gan!

305
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:32,898
Huuh?

306
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,100
{\an1}Aagh!

307
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,670
Naruto!
You all right?!

308
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:38,374
What happened?

309
00:20:39,543 --> 00:20:42,247
{\an1}This guy...
He looks
just like me.

310
00:20:43,415 --> 00:20:44,016
{\an1}And he...

311
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:45,684
What...?!

312
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,624
{\an1}I think he was my dark half.

313
00:20:49,191 --> 00:20:50,058
[gasp]

314
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,335
{\an1}We're both just the same.
The same strength,
the same jutsu...

315
00:20:56,369 --> 00:20:58,906
{\an1}The same fighting style,
same tricks-

316
00:20:58,939 --> 00:21:00,975
{\an1}everything is
identical with us!

317
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,111
{\an1}We'd fight forever!

318
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,383
How can this be?!

319
00:21:05,749 --> 00:21:06,951
You must defeat him.

320
00:21:06,984 --> 00:21:10,023
Or you won't be able
to handle the Tailed
Beast's power.

321
00:21:10,056 --> 00:21:10,790
Huh?

322
00:21:11,592 --> 00:21:12,394
I told you...

323
00:21:13,461 --> 00:21:16,567
{\an1}The Waterfall of Truth
is merely the first step.

324
00:22:58,024 --> 00:23:01,028
{\an1}<i>[Motoi]</i>
<i>Master Bee and I were</i>
<i>close friends once.</i>

325
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:02,931
<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Wait, that's it!</i>
<i>I've got it!</i>

326
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:06,471
{\an1}<i>Motoi! You can go ask</i>
<i>Octopops for training</i>
<i>hints on my behalf!</i>

327
00:23:06,504 --> 00:23:08,139
{\an1}<i>[Motoi]</i>
<i>I'm sorry, I can't.</i>

328
00:23:08,173 --> 00:23:09,908
<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>What? Why not?</i>

329
00:23:09,942 --> 00:23:13,515
{\an4}<i>[Motoi]</i>
<i>I am not worthy of</i>
<i>such an errand.</i>
<i>I once tried to.</i>

330
00:23:14,182 --> 00:23:18,188
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>Killer Bee and Motoi. </i>

331
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,193
{\an1}<i>I wonder what happened</i>
<i>between those two...</i>
