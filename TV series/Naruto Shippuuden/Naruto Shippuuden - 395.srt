1
00:00:27,676 --> 00:00:30,213
Stop there!

2
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:35,685
You're a Leaf
shinobi?

3
00:00:35,718 --> 00:00:42,594
{\an1}Yes, I'm Kakashi Hatake of the
Hidden Leaf Village. Our leader,
the Hokage, sent me here.

4
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:47,699
{\an1}I bear with me a joint
letter from the Hidden
Leaf and the Hidden Sand.

5
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:50,001
Fine. I'll
accept it.

6
00:00:50,035 --> 00:00:55,708
{\an1}No, I've been ordered to present
it only to your leader, Hanzo of
the  Salamander himself.

7
00:00:56,175 --> 00:00:59,912
{\an1}You may not!! Why
do you want to get
close to Lord Hanzo?

8
00:01:00,746 --> 00:01:06,186
{\an1}Threatening me is the same
as threatening the Hidden
Leaf and the Hidden Sand.

9
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,090
{\an1}Is that really what
you want to do?

10
00:01:09,657 --> 00:01:11,259
[gasp]

11
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:15,897
{\an1}All right then...
I'll let him know.

12
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:09,157
{\an1}[rain and thunder]

13
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:20,269
Lord Hanzo will see you
now. Surender all of
your weapons and enter.

14
00:03:20,303 --> 00:03:22,205
<i>[Thinking]</i>
<i>The rumors were correct.</i>

15
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,509
{\an1}<i>They have strict rules</i>
<i>about entering this nation.</i>

16
00:03:32,717 --> 00:03:35,520
<i>[Thinking]</i>
<i>It seems his security</i>
<i>is air tight...</i>

17
00:03:35,553 --> 00:03:38,724
<i>(Hanzo)</i>
<i>Kakashi Katake.</i>
<i>Good of you to come.</i>

18
00:03:38,923 --> 00:03:42,161
<i>(Hanzo)</i>
<i>You may put the message</i>
<i>that you brought over there.</i>

19
00:04:24,876 --> 00:04:29,781
{\an1}The Leaf's invited us to the
Chunin Exams they're
sponsoring with the Sand.

20
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:34,286
{\an1}It's probably just a ploy
to gather all of the
villages and spy on them.

21
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:39,358
{\an1}Hanzo sent many genin before

22
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:44,063
{\an1}so that they could represent
the village in the previous
Chunin Exams...

23
00:04:44,096 --> 00:04:49,838
{\an1}Then this time around,
we shall send a few
teams to placate them, too.

24
00:04:50,137 --> 00:04:54,342
{\an1}Let them keep believing
Hanzo's still the leader of
the Hidden Rain Village

25
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,812
While we gather
intel on the Jinchuriki.

26
00:04:57,846 --> 00:05:00,616
Understood.

27
00:05:28,981 --> 00:05:32,752
{\an1}Is everyone present now?

28
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:42,095
{\an1}A letter has arrived from
Hanzo of the Salamander
from the Hidden Rain Village.

29
00:05:42,796 --> 00:05:44,732
Huh...

30
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:49,069
Well, well...

31
00:05:49,103 --> 00:05:54,376
{\an1}He's sending genin to join the
Hidden Leaf and the Hidden Sand,
as he did previously.

32
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:59,815
{\an4}So does this repudiate the
rumors that we've been hearing
about the Hidden Rain Village,
then?

33
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:05,421
{\an1}No, I'm afraid it doesn't.
Sending some genin to
participate could just be a ruse

34
00:06:05,454 --> 00:06:08,157
{\an1}to hide the truth of what's
really going on.

35
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,660
Then...?

36
00:06:09,693 --> 00:06:13,297
{\an1}Huh. When the Hidden Rain genin
that they're sending arrive
in the Leaf,

37
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,801
{\an1}make sure to keep
a close eye on them.

38
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:36,523
[big yawn]

39
00:06:37,223 --> 00:06:41,428
Man, I am so
bored...

40
00:06:47,903 --> 00:06:50,973
Fuu! Lord Shibuki
wants to see you.

41
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:55,577
{\an1}What?! Oh no! Did I
do something wrong?

42
00:07:04,054 --> 00:07:06,957
<i>(Kegon)</i>
<i>Lord Shibuki, we've</i>
<i>brought Fuu.</i>

43
00:07:07,524 --> 00:07:09,860
Hey! Fuu!

44
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:14,032
Uh, hey. So, what's
up there, Chief?

45
00:07:14,065 --> 00:07:15,667
{\an1}What were you thinking!?

46
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,671
{\an1}Why'd you send an application
for the Chunin Exams to the
Hidden Leaf?

47
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:24,043
Was that bad? So, then,
can you just recommend
me, for real, sir?

48
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:28,681
{\an1}What!? Seriously!? What
will you do if it's found
out you're a Jinchuriki?

49
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:32,786
Well then, I guess
I'll just go on my
own...!

50
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,555
[gasp] Uh, hold
on, wait!

51
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,059
Just wait, Fuu.

52
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:40,695
I wanna see what
the outside world's
all about!

53
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:44,232
{\an1}If you won't acknowledge
me, Chief, I'll just have
to leave the village!

54
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:46,200
Uh... All right!

55
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:50,338
{\an1}I know that you never
give up once you make
up your mind.

56
00:07:50,372 --> 00:07:52,474
So you'll let
me go, then?!

57
00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:56,412
But just listen
to me, okay?

58
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:57,847
[small gasp]

59
00:07:59,214 --> 00:08:03,286
{\an1}The Chunin Exams isn't
just some run-of-the-mill
test.

60
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,891
{\an1}It's a battle where you put
your life on the line for
your dreams

61
00:08:06,924 --> 00:08:08,592
{\an1}and the pride of
your village.

62
00:08:08,626 --> 00:08:13,865
{\an1}Throughout our past, the Hidden
Waterfall Village was smaller
than the Leaf of Sand...

63
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:19,005
{\an1}Despite that, we were feared as
a shinobi village that always
produced skilled jonin.

64
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:24,744
{\an4}That's why, even though we
aren't part of the Five Great
Nations, we're allotted a Tailed
Beast.

65
00:08:24,777 --> 00:08:25,878
[small gasp]

66
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,117
{\an1}The new Chunin Exams is
our chance to impress other
shinobi leaders

67
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,886
and Feudal
Lords who hire Hidden Villages.

68
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:38,126
{\an1}This is an ideal opportunity
to restore our past glory.

69
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,231
{\an7}Since you insist, go, fight
well, and make  a name for the
Hidden Waterfall.

70
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:48,336
{\an8}Woohoo! All right!
I'm on it! I'm gonna
go rile up a storm!

71
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:53,642
{\an7}However! Don't let
anybody find out that
you're a Jinchuriki...

72
00:08:53,676 --> 00:08:55,444
<i>(Fuu)</i>
<i>Okay!!!</i>

73
00:08:55,478 --> 00:08:57,346
[sigh]

74
00:08:57,647 --> 00:09:02,419
{\an8}Kegon, Yourou...
Hide that you're
jonin and guard Fuu.

75
00:09:02,452 --> 00:09:03,855
{\an8}-Right!
-Right!

{\an1}But still, it is
an official application.

close the registration
period.

{\an1}We forgot to sign up
any entrants from the
Hidden Leaf Village!

{\an1}What!?

87

{\an7}Yes, I am planning to
oversee the finals of
the second round

88
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:51,374
{\an8}so no fatalities
occur during it.

89
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:54,443
{\an8}You think you'll
solve something by
outing the rebels!?

90
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:55,646
{\an8}No...

91
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,783
{\an8}Then why do this!?
Why would you face
danger head on?

92
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:05,256
{\an7}My feelings haven't
changed since that
time...

93
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:10,896
{\an7}You mean, you wanna find some
way to bond with the rebels!?
But that's impossible!

94
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,401
{\an7}Even though you want to do
that, they're never going
to lilsten to you!

95
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:20,506
{\an7}He is... Naruto is
working hard to forge
bonds with others...

96
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,077
{\an7}So I'm not going to
give up either,

97
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,616
{\an7}'till the day I can
share suffering, sadness,
and joy with others...

98
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:34,655
{\an7}I think of this as my
first true test as
Kazekage of the Sand.

Waterfall also sent word that
they will be sending a team of 3

103
00:10:56,213 --> 00:11:01,518
{\an1}The Hidden Cloud and the
Land of Water have both

to enter the same amount of
participants as we did in the
last Exams.

106
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:19,273

barely cooked!

when there's still a little
red left inside of it.

111
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:57,282
{\an1}Hey, Asuma Sensei... What'll our
team do? For the new Chunin
Exams I mean.

112
00:11:57,815 --> 00:12:01,086
{\an1}Considering your skill level
now, it's only natural that I

113
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:03,021
{\an1}recommend you for the
competition.

114
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:07,393
{\an1}But Shikamaru's already
a chunin so he can't enter.

115
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:12,198
Huh... So that means
we're gonna be one
member short.

116
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,866
{\an1}Listen, guys, currently,

117
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,404
{\an1}Shikamaru is kind of like
the brains, the leader of
this team...

118
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:20,708
{\an1}And if I'm to find
a replacement, then...

119
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:24,980
{\an1}It'll be hard for them
to be a stand-in for
just the Chunin Exams.

120
00:12:25,013 --> 00:12:29,150
You know... I think I
may already have
someone in mind...

Hm?

122
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:35,124
{\an1}Are you serious? Someone
who rivals Shikamaru in
intelligence?

123
00:12:35,157 --> 00:12:37,394
Wow...

124
00:12:42,332 --> 00:12:45,836
Ah... ah...
achoo!

125
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:49,007
Is there really
someone like that?

126
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,612
{\an1}Well, maybe she's not as smart
as Shikamaru, but she just
might be tougher than him!

127
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:01,754
You're gonna be
fine now!

{\an1}<i>At the last Chunin Exams...</i>
<i>I got a real good taste of</i>
<i>your power...</i>

139
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:52,644
{\an1}Still, I can't...
Please, just find
someone else, okay?

140
00:13:52,677 --> 00:13:56,048
{\an7}What!? Why? Listen, we both know
just how hard you've been

141
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:58,984
{\an7}training under Lady Tsunade for
the past two years...

142
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:01,654
{\an7}You've grown so much
in that time!

143
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:03,756
{\an8}[gasp]

144
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,694
{\an7}If you're just going to wait for
Naruto and Sasuke,

145
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:11,598
{\an7}then you'll never be able to
grab any of the opportunities
that come your way!

146
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:13,733
No, it's not that, Ino.

147
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:18,106
{\an1}If you add me to your team
now, I'll probably just
get in your guys' way.

148
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:21,043
{\an1}No, that's not
true! C'mon, please!

149
00:14:33,591 --> 00:14:35,959
Take this!
Cha!

150
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:44,802
{\an1}Your movements are
getting much better!

151
00:14:44,835 --> 00:14:49,040
{\an1}By the way, do you
remember the first
thing I taught you?

152
00:14:49,074 --> 00:14:52,777
{\an1}Of course, ma'am! Medic Ninja
must never get themselves
killed.

153
00:14:52,811 --> 00:14:55,882
Thus, they must never
force their way forward
in combat.

154
00:14:55,915 --> 00:14:57,583
{\an1}Yes, that is true.

155
00:14:57,617 --> 00:15:03,123
{\an1}At the same time, that does not
excuse you from learning how to
fight on the front line.

156
00:15:03,157 --> 00:15:07,595
{\an1}And, what I'm teaching
you right now...

157
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:13,067
{\an1}Keep it in your heart as you
continue training. Got it?

158
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:14,936
Yes!

159
00:15:27,983 --> 00:15:31,688
{\an7}<i>While I'm training, I feel</i>
<i>like I'm always a burden</i>
<i>to others. </i>

160
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:34,724
{\an8}<i>But...</i>

161
00:15:37,461 --> 00:15:39,397
Hm?

162
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:46,939
How'd it go? What
did Sakura say?

163
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:48,840
Well, she turned
us down.

164
00:15:48,874 --> 00:15:53,879
{\an1}Whaaat!? But our team's
short 1 and she's short 2
for the Chunin Exams!

165
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,082
{\an1}I thought this would be
the perfect solution.

166
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:59,085
{\an1}What exactly did
Sakura say to you?

167
00:15:59,118 --> 00:16:02,923
{\an1}She basically told me that
she doesn't want to be a
burden on all of us.

168
00:16:02,957 --> 00:16:07,362
{\an1}That really sounds
like a big drag.

169
00:16:07,395 --> 00:16:10,432
But I'm not gonna
give up that easily!

170
00:16:21,644 --> 00:16:24,880
[sigh]

171
00:16:30,587 --> 00:16:34,425
[chatter]

172
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:35,926
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>Excuse me!</i>

173
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:39,797
{\an1}Oh, I'm sorry.

174
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:44,169
Go ahead.
Thanks so much!

175
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:54,247
{\an1}Excuse me! Can you look
at these and put your
seal of approval on them?

176
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:57,585
{\an1}Shizune! Are you trying
to work me to death?

177
00:16:57,618 --> 00:17:00,787
It's been a while since
we had the Chunin Exams.

178
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,657
And we aren't gonna be
able to move forward with

179
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,359
anything at all without
your express approval!

180
00:17:05,393 --> 00:17:09,298
{\an1}Damn it... I didn't
expect there to be
so much work...

181
00:17:09,331 --> 00:17:12,367
{\an1}Oh, I forgot. Sakura
was just outside here.

182
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:16,739
{\an1}She was? If she needed
something why didn't
she come in?

183
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:31,822
<i>[thinking]</i>
<i>What would Naruto do if</i>
<i>he was in my place?</i>

184
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:38,296
All right, I'm going to
attack you now, and it's
going to be for real!

185
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,665
[gasp]

186
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:42,768
Come at me like you
mean it, too, as if
I'm really your enemy!

187
00:17:42,802 --> 00:17:43,969
[small grunt]

188
00:17:45,938 --> 00:17:47,907
Right! You
got it.

189
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:53,647
[gasp]

190
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,256
[gasp]

191
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:07,329
What happened?

192
00:18:07,363 --> 00:18:14,169
{\an1}Sakura! This man got caught
in a landslide on a mission.
He's critical!

193
00:18:16,306 --> 00:18:19,042
{\an1}He needs emergency
surgery, now!

194
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:21,010
Take him to the
ICU quickly!

195
00:18:21,044 --> 00:18:22,413
{\an1}Right!

196
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:30,988
Okay... I'm
starting treatment.

197
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,296
{\an7}<i>I can't keep running behind</i>
<i>Naruto and Sasuke forever.</i>

198
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,435
{\an7}<i>I have to surpass my</i>
<i>limits on my own...</i>

199
00:18:46,673 --> 00:18:49,176
Whoa!

200
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:57,652
Ahh!

201
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:09,733
{\an7}<i>It's no good! I don't</i>
<i>have enough chakra!</i>

202
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:12,736
{\an7}<i>I need to focus more</i>
<i>chakra for the surgery!</i>

203
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:24,549
{\an7}<i>More... more chakra!</i>

204
00:19:24,582 --> 00:19:27,118
<i>(Tsunade)</i>
<i>Sakura is what!?</i>

205
00:19:27,151 --> 00:19:30,422
Yes, we just
received word from
the Leaf Hospital.

206
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:32,124
Damn...

207
00:19:32,157 --> 00:19:37,664
{\an7}What? Sorry, but I don't
understand. Sakura is skilled
enough to handle the surgery.

208
00:19:37,697 --> 00:19:42,335
{\an1}If she were her
usual self. We
have to go!

209
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,702
Sakura!

210
00:20:16,073 --> 00:20:20,478
{\an1}She completed the
Jutsu ritual using
her chakra.

211
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:24,782
{\an1}The surgery succeeded.
Just leave it to a
student of yours!

212
00:20:24,817 --> 00:20:26,919
{\an1}She did a great job!

213
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:28,587
I see!

214
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:33,727

we had last time,  but it's a
good list of participants!

{\an1}Yes...

219

has come...
