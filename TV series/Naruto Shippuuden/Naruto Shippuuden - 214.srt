Hey.

00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,215
Mmm.
Huh?

4
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:29,617
Where's Sakura?

5
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:31,386
[moans]

6
00:00:32,654 --> 00:00:35,723
{\an1}You were in pursuit
of Sasuke, right?
Which way did Sakura go?

7
00:00:36,724 --> 00:00:39,526
{\an1}Head north,
towards two o'clock.

8
00:00:40,227 --> 00:00:43,497
{\an1}You have to go about
one kilometer.

9
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:46,165
{\an1}That Sakura.

10
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:49,835
{\an4}Looks like she learned
how to blend a powerful
sleeping powder from
Lady Tsunade.

11
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,571
{\an1}They won't be getting
up anytime soon.

12
00:00:57,777 --> 00:00:58,843
There you go.

13
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,449
{\an1}Sorry, everyone.
I've got to rush ahead.

14
00:01:11,922 --> 00:01:14,425
What's in it for
you to join me?

15
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,461
{\an1}Just what are you plotting?

16
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:19,596
{\an1}I'm not plotting anything!

17
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:22,365
{\an1}Ever since you left the
Hidden Leaf Village,

18
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:26,469
{\an1}I just keep finding myself
regretting not going with you.

19
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:31,840
{\an7}<i>She's... his old teammate.</i>

20
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:36,178
{\an7}<i>She also has a thing for him...</i>
<i>But...</i>

21
00:01:38,547 --> 00:01:42,850
{\an1}Look. I'll do anything
that you want me to.
I'm tired of regrets.

22
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:46,087
{\an1}Do you know what I really want?

23
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:49,923
{\an1}Don't you understand?
I don't care what it is!
I'll do whatever you say--

24
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:50,990
To destroy the Leaf!

25
00:01:51,425 --> 00:01:52,192
[gasp]

26
00:01:52,593 --> 00:01:54,094
<i>That is what I want!</i>

27
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:56,730
You think you could
really do that?

28
00:01:56,763 --> 00:01:59,265
Betray the Hidden
Leaf Village for me?

29
00:02:00,132 --> 00:02:03,268
{\an1}Yes. I would, if
you asked me to.

30
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:07,306
{\an1}All right, then why don't
you prove it to me.

31
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:09,941
{\an1}I want you to kill her now.

32
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,144
{\an1}Do that, and I'll accept
that you're serious.

33
00:02:19,484 --> 00:02:20,485
Hmm.

34
00:02:24,254 --> 00:02:25,055
Who is she?

35
00:02:26,056 --> 00:02:28,225
{\an1}A member of Taka, the
group that I put together.

36
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,795
{\an1}Though at this point,
as you see, she's useless.

37
00:02:32,262 --> 00:02:34,964
Sakura, you're a
Medical Ninja, right?

38
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:39,468
{\an1}<i>It's perfect, you can replace</i>

39
00:02:40,102 --> 00:02:47,175
{\an7}<i>How can he be so cold?</i>
<i>It's true. He's definitely</i>
<i>not the old Sasuke.</i>
<i>He's changed.</i>

40
00:03:02,823 --> 00:03:04,391
{\an1}What's the matter, Sakura?

41
00:03:05,392 --> 00:03:06,593
You can't do it?

42
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:10,229
{\an7}<i>This woman is innocent.</i>

43
00:03:11,097 --> 00:03:12,899
{\an8}<i>But, If I just...</i>

44
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:15,835
{\an7}<i>I've got to stab</i>
<i>Sasuke right now.</i>

45
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:17,703
{\an8}<i>Then it'll all</i>
<i>be over!</i>

46
00:03:18,571 --> 00:03:21,072
{\an1}Don't do it, Sasuke.

47
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,314
{\an7}<i>He really meant to kill her.</i>

48
00:03:31,248 --> 00:03:32,784
{\an1}How you've fallen, Sasuke.

49
00:03:46,596 --> 00:03:48,898
{\an1}Heh. One after another.

50
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:53,235
{\an1}Sakura, you intended to kill
Sasuke by yourself, didn't you?

51
00:03:55,103 --> 00:03:57,940
{\an1}There's no need for you to
bear such a heavy burden.

52
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,279
{\an1}After all, it was my cowardice
that drove you all apart when
I was the leader of Team 7.

53
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:11,319
{\an1}Sakura, I once tried to put
you at ease by telling you
something irresponsible.

56
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:22,896
{\an1}It's all right. Don't you worry.
We'll soon have 'em back to
their old selves again.

57
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,365
{\an1}Perhaps I was trying to
convince myself, too.

58
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,468
I'm sorry I'm such
a careless Sensei.

59
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:30,736
{\an1}But you're not.

60
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:35,541
{\an1}Sasuke, I've told
you this before.

61
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:37,509
{\an1}And I don't like
to repeat myself.

62

you can kill me at
any moment you wish?

{\an1}Stop acting like you're
still my Sensei!

something if you'd like.

I will settle this once
and for all.

{\an1}You know, I really don't like

Can your borrowed Sharingan
extinguish power like this?!

But, Naruto doesn't get any.

183

breaking the rules and

weak and ineffective.

193
00:15:57,025 --> 00:16:00,195

You're the first squad

You hate me.

{\an1}Even in the beginning,
you couldn't ever stand me.

Remember?

219
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:53,498
Back when we made Genin,
and were assigned to our
three-man squads...

220
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:58,337
{\an1}We were alone together,
for the first time, right
here on this very spot.

221
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:01,072
You got so mad
at me that day.

222

Alone. Isolated.

Huh?

it means to be alone.

you saying that?

day when it all began.

It was so much fun!

I know about your clan,
Sasuke, I do.
But seeking revenge...

rest of you can't follow.

have worked together.

I thought I could take
that road instead.

00:19:14,606 --> 00:19:18,242
{\an1}<i>But in the end,</i>

how painful a thing
solitude can be.
