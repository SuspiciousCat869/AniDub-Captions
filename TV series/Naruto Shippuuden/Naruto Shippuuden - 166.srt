1
00:00:07,284 --> 00:00:10,221
{\an1}-I'm going to show the
world what true pain is,

2
00:00:10,255 --> 00:00:14,261
{\an1}and stop all the wars with the
terror that pain will inspire.

3
00:00:14,294 --> 00:00:17,497
{\an1}I shall lead the world down the
road to stability and peace.

4
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:20,102
{\an1}-But if you do achieve
peace like that,

5
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:22,538
{\an1}then the whole thing is
nothing but a big lie.

6
00:00:22,572 --> 00:00:26,411
{\an1}-Human beings are not the
most intelligent of creatures.

7
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:29,849
{\an1}This is the only way that
peace can be achieved.

8
00:00:29,882 --> 00:00:31,352
Of course, after
several decades,

9
00:00:31,385 --> 00:00:34,889
{\an1}that pain too will
eventually fade with time.

10
00:00:34,923 --> 00:00:37,193
{\an1}It will no longer
act as a deterrent.

11
00:00:37,226 --> 00:00:39,596
Humanity will
return to war again.

12
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:42,600
{\an1}This time, they themselves will
use the tailed beast weapon

13
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:46,039
{\an1}against one another, and
reconfirm what true pain is,

14
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:50,278
{\an1}and then for a time, peace
will briefly be restored again.

15
00:00:50,312 --> 00:00:53,783
{\an1}In the course of this
endless cycle of hatred

16
00:00:53,816 --> 00:00:56,354
{\an1}begetting more hatred,
this unbearable pain

17
00:00:56,388 --> 00:00:59,158
{\an1}will give rise to
momentary peace.

18
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:01,127
{\an1}This is my dream and my goal.

19
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:07,069
-Nagato, please
don't push yourself.

20
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:08,670
{\an1}You've already spent
so much chakra.

21
00:01:22,992 --> 00:01:26,329
{\an1}-Peace is now within our grasp.

22
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:36,411
[theme music]

23
00:01:36,411 --> 00:01:46,425
[theme music]

24
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:13,181
{\an1}-Hey, I guarantee everybody that
I'm going to be Hokage one day.

25
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:13,815
Just watch.

26
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:16,320
{\an1}I'll show you all.

27
00:03:16,353 --> 00:03:18,121
{\an1}FEMALE SPEAKER 1: It's that boy.

28
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,158
The Nine Tails.

29
00:03:20,191 --> 00:03:21,527
He's awful.

30
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,697
{\an1}FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Hey, we're
not supposed to talk about that.

31
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:27,168
{\an1}-Ko, what's the Nine Tails?

32
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:30,340
{\an1}-Oh, it's nothing that you need
to worry about, Lady Hinata,

33
00:03:30,373 --> 00:03:32,676
{\an1}but you must stay
away from that boy.

34
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,559
{\an1}HINATA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

35
00:03:43,592 --> 00:03:46,930
{\an1}-You argue that my mission
of peace is merely a lie.

36
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:48,999
{\an1}But in this cursed
world, a peace

37
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:51,769
{\an1}where people truly
understand each other

38
00:03:51,802 --> 00:03:53,406
{\an1}is nothing but fiction.

39
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,509
-But I truly
believe that the day

40
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:58,313
{\an1}will come when all people
will understand one another

41
00:03:58,346 --> 00:04:00,516
{\an1}and live in harmony.

42
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:03,387
{\an1}-But Pervy Sage believed
that one day people

43
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,224
{\an1}would understand each
other and live in harmony.

44
00:04:06,257 --> 00:04:08,160
{\an1}You're the one who's wrong.

45
00:04:08,193 --> 00:04:09,962
-Empty words.

46
00:04:09,995 --> 00:04:13,100
{\an1}You don't even have an answer
to how you'd achieve peace.

47
00:04:13,134 --> 00:04:16,905
Your only option
now is to give me

48
00:04:16,938 --> 00:04:19,710
{\an1}the power of the Nine
tails for my own use.

49
00:04:23,683 --> 00:04:27,621
And then after
that, as I told you,

50
00:04:27,655 --> 00:04:29,691
{\an1}your death would lead to peace.

51
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:35,965
{\an1}-I want to grow up
to be a great ninja.

52
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:38,437
{\an1}I'll be strong like my father.

53
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,406
{\an1}And I'll be kind like my mother.

54
00:04:50,854 --> 00:04:54,058
{\an1}-Lord Hiashi is very
strict, but only

55
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:56,128
{\an1}because he holds such
high hopes for you.

56
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:05,141
{\an1}One day, you'll enter this
academy too, Lady Hinata.

57
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:06,976
-Will I make it?

58
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,581
{\an1}-Yes, of course, you
will, so do your best.

59
00:05:19,294 --> 00:05:20,730
-It's that boy.

60
00:05:20,764 --> 00:05:24,569
{\an1}-Lady Hinata, you mustn't
associate with that child.

61
00:05:24,603 --> 00:05:26,773
-But why not?

62
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:27,973
{\an1}-It's time for your training.

63
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:28,941
Let's go.

64
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:39,290
-Oh, Naruto.

65
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:48,335
{\an1}-What's wrong, Neji?

66
00:05:50,972 --> 00:05:53,477
{\an1}That's Lord Jiraiya's
summoning frog.

67
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,880
-What?

68
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:58,551
{\an1}-So most likely, we'll
find the real Pain

69
00:05:58,584 --> 00:06:01,188
{\an1}at one of the highest spots
near the Leaf village.

70
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:03,324
{\an1}SHIKAKU: Right, let's
search every single site

71
00:06:03,357 --> 00:06:05,226
{\an1}that's at high altitude.

72
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:08,565
{\an1}We need to be in two men
teams at the very least.

73
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:12,471
{\an1}Even if you find the real
Pain, don't strike right away.

74
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:14,474
{\an1}MALE SPEAKER: Please
include sensory tech ninjas

75
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,541
{\an1}in the search parties too.

76
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,811
{\an1}It'll go quicker.

77
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:19,079
{\an1}SHIKAKU: right then.

78
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:23,052
{\an1}Shikamaru, wait here with
Shiho for us to report in.

79
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:26,791
{\an1}-I hate this, but there's no
choice since I can't move.

80
00:06:26,824 --> 00:06:29,995
{\an1}-Lady Katsuyu, if you
please, relay this

81
00:06:30,028 --> 00:06:32,532
{\an1}to all able-bodied
survivors in the village.

82
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:34,803
{\an1}We need all the help
that we can get.

83
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:35,637
-Yes, sir.

84
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,274
Understood.

85
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:42,780
{\an1}-I want to become a great
ninja, strong like my father

86
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:48,688
{\an1}and kind like my mother as well.

87
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:54,631
{\an1}To become a great ninja,
strong like father.

88
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:16,428
KO: Lady Hinata!

89
00:07:31,382 --> 00:07:32,017
-Hey you.

90
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,589
-I'm sorry.

91
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,892
-Hold on She's a
Hyuga girl, isn't she?

92
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,895
{\an1}-Yeah, she's got those eyes.

93
00:07:39,928 --> 00:07:42,699
{\an1}-She must be Neji's cousin then.

94
00:07:42,732 --> 00:07:45,369
{\an1}-And she's probably
stuck up like him too.

95
00:07:45,402 --> 00:07:47,105
-Yeah, I bet she
thinks she's better

96
00:07:47,138 --> 00:07:49,977
{\an1}than us because of
her family and talent.

97
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,911
-No.

98
00:07:50,944 --> 00:07:53,047
{\an1}I'm not like that
at all, I swear.

99
00:07:55,718 --> 00:07:58,153
-Come back here.

100
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,591
{\an1}-Trying to run off without
telling us that you're sorry,

101
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:01,158
huh?

102
00:08:01,192 --> 00:08:02,193
That's not cool.

103
00:08:02,226 --> 00:08:03,061
{\an1}-Yeah, that's right.

104
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,701
{\an1}-Go on, apologize.

105
00:08:07,735 --> 00:08:09,503
{\an1}-And be nice about it too.

106
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:11,640
-Do it, now.

107
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:13,042
-I'm sorry.

108
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,343
{\an1}-Not good enough.

109
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:16,313
{\an1}Say it like you mean it.

110
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:18,316
-Apologize.

111
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:19,752
-I'm sorry.

112
00:08:19,785 --> 00:08:21,220
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:22,222
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:32,503

{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Pain's
chakra is getting inside of me.

116
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:38,578
{\an1}I've avoided any vital
spots and kept them shallow.

117
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:41,549
{\an1}But you will no longer be
able to move on your own.

118
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:45,254
{\an1}-Snap out of it, lad.

119
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:47,625
{\an1}No matter what he
says to you, you

120
00:08:47,658 --> 00:08:49,427
{\an1}must not listen to any of it.

121
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,798
{\an1}You are the child of prophesy.

{\an1}The savior for this whole world.

123

{\an1}Jiraiya boy and Pa risked
their lives for you

124
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,642
{\an1}because they believed in you.

125
00:08:59,675 --> 00:09:02,713
{\an1}No, you're not allowed
to lose, Naruto boy.

126
00:09:02,746 --> 00:09:04,982
{\an1}If you give up now,
I won't forgive you.

127
00:09:05,016 --> 00:09:06,350
You hear me?

128
00:09:06,384 --> 00:09:08,454
Ahhh!

129
00:09:08,487 --> 00:09:10,091
{\an1}-Loud-mouthed frog.

130
00:09:10,124 --> 00:09:11,357
-Bastard!

131
00:09:11,392 --> 00:09:13,327
{\an1}-It's time we were on our way.

132

{\an1}HINATA (VOICEOVER): How cruel.

134
00:09:40,099 --> 00:09:43,370
{\an1}Restricting Naruto's
movement with those rods.

135
00:09:43,403 --> 00:09:47,244
-I won't let you
hurt Naruto anymore.

136
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:48,879
-Reinforcements

137
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:50,882
{\an1}-Why did you come out here?

138
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:51,849
Just run.

139
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,186
You can't win.

140
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,121
-No.

141
00:09:55,155 --> 00:09:58,425
{\an1}I'm just being selfish now.

142
00:09:58,459 --> 00:09:59,828
{\an1}-What's that mean?

143
00:09:59,861 --> 00:10:02,531
{\an1}Hinata, don't put yourself
in dangerous like this.

144
00:10:02,564 --> 00:10:04,201
Just go.

145
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:08,439
I'm here because
I-- I want to be.

146
00:10:08,473 --> 00:10:11,278
{\an1}This time, I'm going
to save you Naruto.

147
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:17,953
{\an1}I used to be such a crybaby.

148
00:10:17,986 --> 00:10:22,159
{\an1}Always given up before I
even got a chance to start.

149
00:10:22,193 --> 00:10:27,600
{\an1}I almost took the wrong paths
so many times, I lost count.

150
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:30,604
{\an1}But you helped me
find my way and take

151
00:10:30,637 --> 00:10:33,374
{\an1}the correct path, Naruto.

152
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:36,179
{\an1}I always chased after
you, wanting to catch up,

153
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:37,915
{\an1}wanting to walk together
with you forever.

00:10:40,686 --> 00:10:43,990
{\an1}You've changed who I am, Naruto.

155
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:48,763
{\an1}Your smiling face
saved me, Naruto.

156
00:10:48,797 --> 00:10:52,035
{\an1}That's why I'm not
afraid to die here

157
00:10:52,069 --> 00:11:02,483
{\an1}if it means I can protect
you, because I love you.

158
00:11:02,516 --> 00:11:03,684
I always will.

159
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:01,467
-Hinata!

160
00:12:14,453 --> 00:12:17,423
{\an1}HINATA (VOICEOVER): I can't
get close to Naruto like this,

161
00:12:17,457 --> 00:12:18,926
{\an1}but I have to do something.

162
00:12:35,883 --> 00:12:37,752
{\an1}I can't let it end like this.

163
00:12:37,785 --> 00:12:40,289
{\an1}If there's even the slightest
chance of reaching him,

164
00:12:40,323 --> 00:12:42,159
{\an1}I have to take it.

165
00:12:42,192 --> 00:12:44,496
{\an1}Gentle step twin lion fists.

166
00:13:03,688 --> 00:13:04,123
-Nagato.

167
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:09,064
{\an1}HINATA (VOICEOVER):
Now's my chance.

168
00:13:13,303 --> 00:13:14,104
One more time.

169
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:24,051
-Hinata!

170
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,160
Knock it off.

171
00:13:30,194 --> 00:13:31,595
-Huh?

172
00:13:31,628 --> 00:13:33,332
{\an1}-And what the heck do you want?

173
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:35,401
{\an1}-Hey, wait, he's that kid.

174
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:37,471
{\an1}That kid who's always
getting into trouble.

175
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:39,373
{\an1}That kid everyone hates.

176
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:40,041
-Oh, that

177
00:13:40,074 --> 00:13:43,379
-That kid, huh?

178
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:45,682
{\an1}-Hey, I'm not that kid.

179
00:13:45,715 --> 00:13:47,785
{\an1}My name is Naruto Uzumaki.

180
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:49,788
{\an1}I'm going to be Hokage one day.

181
00:13:49,821 --> 00:13:51,557
Remember that.

182
00:13:51,592 --> 00:13:52,058
-Hokage?

183
00:13:55,897 --> 00:13:57,098
{\an1}KID 1: Are you crazy?

184
00:13:57,132 --> 00:13:59,402
{\an1}KID 2: What a bunch of baloney.

185
00:13:59,436 --> 00:14:01,071
{\an1}KID 3: You're dense, kid.

186
00:14:01,104 --> 00:14:03,542
[laughing]

187
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:15,291
{\an1}-Some idiot kid like you
could never be Hokage.

188
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,877
{\an1}-You want to fight?

189
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:32,815
{\an1}You better not or
you'll regret it.

190
00:14:32,849 --> 00:14:33,717
{\an1}-What's that sign?

191
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:34,486
-Ha.

192
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:34,985
Clone--

193
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:35,753
-No way.

194
00:14:35,786 --> 00:14:36,254
-Jutsu.

195
00:14:50,107 --> 00:14:51,108
-How lame.

196
00:14:51,142 --> 00:14:53,613
-What a loser.

197
00:14:53,646 --> 00:14:55,549
{\an1}-I caught you off
guard, didn't I?

198
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,284
You just watch.

199
00:14:57,318 --> 00:14:58,987
{\an1}I will become Hokage.

200
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,556
{\an1}I'll show all of you.

201
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,461
{\an1}I'll prove you all wrong.

202
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:05,396
-Get him.

203
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,098
{\an1}Don't mess with us, kid.

204
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:11,438
{\an1}We'll make you pay for that.

205
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:12,340
-Lady Hinata!

206
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,514
{\an1}-Come on, let's get out of here.

207
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:22,387
{\an1}-Lady Hinata, are you all right?

208
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,024
It's that boy.

209
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,292
{\an1}Come along, Lady Hinata.

210
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,262
{\an1}-No, wait, he came to help me.

211
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:30,298
-You mustn't get
involved with him.

212
00:15:30,331 --> 00:15:31,866
Now, let's go.

213
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:32,801
-But, wait.

214
00:15:42,181 --> 00:15:43,116
NARUTO: Hinata!

215
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:46,020
Hinata!

216
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:47,556
Hey!

217
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,391
Damn it!

218
00:15:48,424 --> 00:15:48,891
Hinata!

219
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:56,035
Hinata!

220
00:16:52,348 --> 00:16:54,083
Just stop.

221
00:16:54,117 --> 00:16:55,886
{\an1}Please, just stay away.

222
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,262
{\an1}I don't quit and I don't run.

223
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:08,405
{\an1}-People can't change no
matter how hard they try.

224
00:17:08,438 --> 00:17:09,807
-That does it!

225
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,479
{\an1}Who gave you the right to tell
her what she can or can't be?

226
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:15,448
Go on, Hinata.

227
00:17:18,452 --> 00:17:20,188
{\an1}I always thought you
were gloomy, timid,

228
00:17:20,221 --> 00:17:22,525
{\an1}terrified, and basically,
completely weird.

229
00:17:26,564 --> 00:17:27,765
{\an1}But you know what?

230
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:30,235
{\an1}I actually like people like you.

231
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:58,810
-Why?

232
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:02,381
{\an1}Why would someone as weak
as you try to resist?

233
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:08,490
{\an1}Why would you fight me?

234
00:18:12,729 --> 00:18:15,366
{\an1}when you know you'll only die?

235
00:18:26,249 --> 00:18:29,319
{\an1}-Because I'll never
go back on my word.

236
00:18:37,632 --> 00:18:42,605
{\an1}Because-- because
that's my ninja way.

237
00:19:10,244 --> 00:19:13,783
{\an1}-It was just like
this when my parents

238
00:19:13,816 --> 00:19:23,064
{\an1}were killed right before my eyes
by Shinobi of the Hidden Leaf.

239
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:26,467
Because of the
existence of love,

240
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:35,881
{\an1}sacrifice is born as well as
hate, and one comprehends,

241
00:19:35,915 --> 00:19:37,283
one knows pain.

242
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:49,835
Yes, know pain.

243
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,759
-What's that?

244
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:13,135
{\an1}-Do you hate me now?

245
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:35,499

246
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:45,513
[theme music]

247
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:57,883
SHIKAMARU: What
was that explosion?

248
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:01,088
{\an1}KATSUYU: You must all evacuate
as far away as you can.

249
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:03,491
This is Naruto's
Nine Tails power.

250
00:22:03,524 --> 00:22:04,893
SHIKAMARU: What?

251
00:22:04,927 --> 00:22:06,595
{\an1}MALE SPEAKER: I thought Yamato
and Kakashi put a sealing jutsu

252
00:22:06,628 --> 00:22:07,297
on him.

253
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:08,631
{\an1}KATSUYU: It was Hinata.

254
00:22:08,665 --> 00:22:10,868
She was cut down
right in front of him.

255
00:22:10,902 --> 00:22:12,404
{\an1}MALE SPEAKER: That triggered it.

256
00:22:12,437 --> 00:22:14,707
Where is Yamato
when we need him?

257
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,409
{\an1}SHIKAMARU: Next time
on Naruto Shippuden,

258
00:22:16,442 --> 00:22:18,478
{\an1}"Planetary Devastation."

259
00:22:18,512 --> 00:22:19,681
{\an1}MALE SPEAKER: This is bad.

260
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,417
{\an1}This is really, really bad.

261
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:30,163
{\an1}HINATA (VOICEOVER):
Naruto, do you remember?

262
00:22:30,196 --> 00:22:33,601
{\an1}Because I'll never forget it.

263
00:22:33,634 --> 00:22:35,103
That day.

264
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:36,571
{\an1}The day that changed me.

265
00:22:44,582 --> 00:22:46,485
{\an1}Thank you, Naruto.

266
00:22:46,518 --> 00:22:49,223
{\an1}I'm going to do my best.

267
00:22:49,257 --> 00:22:51,425
{\an1}I'll never give up.

268
00:22:51,459 --> 00:22:55,064
{\an1}You'll always be my role model.

269
00:23:06,214 --> 00:23:07,615
-Naru--

{\an1}[stomach growling]

00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:11,488
{\an1}-Man, I'm hungry.

272
00:23:11,521 --> 00:23:14,927
{\an1}Guess I'll go to Ichiraku.

273
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,428
{\an1}HINATA (VOICEOVER): I'm sorry.

274
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:20,801
{\an1}Sorry that I wasn't able
to thank you back then.
