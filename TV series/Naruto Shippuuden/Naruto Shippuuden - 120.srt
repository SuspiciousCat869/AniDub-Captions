[theme music]

2
00:02:05,374 --> 00:02:07,507
-At last, you're finally here.

3
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,174
-So what's our status?

4
00:02:09,207 --> 00:02:11,407
-There are, at least,
50 enemy ninja.

5
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:14,241
By comparison, only the
four of us here are left.

6
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,307
-The battle's almost over.

7
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,441
Let's get them now!

8
00:02:24,474 --> 00:02:26,407
MINATO: All of you,
please direct these kunai

9
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:29,041
knives at the enemy all at once.

10
00:02:29,074 --> 00:02:32,307
I'll take care of
the rest myself.

11
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:33,374
-That's crazy.

12
00:02:33,407 --> 00:02:35,007
Not even you could possibly--

13
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:35,907
-Be quiet.

14
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:37,874
Do as he says.

15
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:41,274
We'll get to see how the Yellow
Flash of the Leaf battles.

16
00:02:41,307 --> 00:02:42,807
Just don't blink.

17
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:43,874
You'll miss it.

18
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:54,741
-[grunts]

19
00:02:59,107 --> 00:03:01,141
-It's healing very nicely.

20
00:03:01,174 --> 00:03:04,941
But don't overexert yourself
or you'll reopen the wound, OK?

21
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:10,307
-When you and I
both got wounded,

22
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:12,374
it was Rin who
saved both our lives

23
00:03:12,407 --> 00:03:14,507
with her medical ninjutsu.

24
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,274
If it weren't for her,
we'd both be dead.

25
00:03:17,307 --> 00:03:19,207
We would have died long ago!

26
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,807
Look, saving Rin takes
priority over the mission.

27
00:03:21,841 --> 00:03:23,674
And that's that!

28
00:03:23,707 --> 00:03:25,741
-Rules and regulations
are indeed important.

29
00:03:25,774 --> 00:03:28,441
But that doesn't mean
they're all that matters.

30
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:31,841
I told you, at times,
you must adapt and take

31
00:03:31,874 --> 00:03:33,307
steps appropriate
to the situation.

32
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:44,807
-I believe that the White
Fang was a true hero.

33
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:46,107
You're right.

34
00:03:46,141 --> 00:03:48,707
In the ninja world, those
who break the rules and laws

35
00:03:48,741 --> 00:03:50,941
are regarded as scum.

36
00:03:50,974 --> 00:03:55,074
But those who would abandon
even one of their friends

37
00:03:55,107 --> 00:03:56,407
are far worse than scum.

38
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:12,307
OBITO (VOICEOVER):
I've found them.

39
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:13,574
Stay calm.

40
00:04:13,607 --> 00:04:14,441
You can do this.

41
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:23,141
-I'll take care of him.

42
00:04:23,174 --> 00:04:28,474
Just continue your genjutsu and
get the information we need.

43
00:04:28,507 --> 00:04:30,007
Camouflage Jutsu, now!

44
00:04:38,574 --> 00:04:41,407
-All right, let's go!

45
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:42,241
-Where are we going?

46
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:03,274
-Kakashi?

47
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:05,007
Why did you--

48
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,707
-Well, I certainly
can't leave this up

49
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:09,741
to a crybaby ninja
like you, can I?

50
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:12,474
-Kakashi.

51
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:16,207
-I know that silver hair
and that white light blade.

52
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:20,107
Could it be White
Fang of the Leaf?

53
00:05:20,141 --> 00:05:22,774
-This is a memento
from my father.

54
00:05:22,807 --> 00:05:25,107
To carry out a mission,
a ninja should only

55
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:27,874
have the tools necessary
to the task at hand.

56
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:31,607
Useless things like emotions
only get in the way.

57
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:34,307
-Kakashi, you're--

58
00:05:34,341 --> 00:05:35,574
-Oh, I see.

59
00:05:35,607 --> 00:05:37,841
You're just the
White Fang's brat.

60
00:05:37,874 --> 00:05:39,641
Then there's nothing
to be nervous about.

61
00:05:45,741 --> 00:05:46,907
-I thought so.

62
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:48,907
Even his smell is gone.

63
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:51,441
We'll have to locate him by
the slightest hint of sound.

64
00:05:54,241 --> 00:05:56,274
-OK, where is he?

65
00:06:00,207 --> 00:06:01,307
-Obito, behind you!

66
00:06:06,341 --> 00:06:07,807
Aah!

67
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:09,441
My eye!

68
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:10,941
-Kakashi!

69
00:06:10,974 --> 00:06:13,441
-[groans]

70
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:16,541
-Kakashi, hey,
are you all right?

71
00:06:16,574 --> 00:06:17,007
-Ugh.

72
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:21,574
[rustling]

73

STONE NINJA: Even if
they are just kids,

74
00:06:23,274 --> 00:06:24,774
it can't hurt to be cautious.

75
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:28,241
I'm going to take
this nice and slow.

76
00:06:28,274 --> 00:06:30,941
-That guy, he's good.

77
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,041
He got rid of the knife
stain with my blood

78
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:34,341
so I couldn't smell it.

79
00:06:37,074 --> 00:06:39,974
You got some of that
dust in your eyes again?

80
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:42,274
A shinobi shouldn't cry.

81
00:06:42,307 --> 00:06:44,241
I'm not dead yet.

82
00:06:44,274 --> 00:06:46,307
Stay focused.

83
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:48,241
-[sniffs]

84
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,807
-You can't get
dust in your eyes,

85
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:52,641
not when you're
wearing goggles, Obito.

86
00:06:52,674 --> 00:06:54,641
It's fine to speak
of self-control,

87
00:06:54,674 --> 00:06:57,874
but you must be strong at
heart, not just in your words.

88
00:06:57,907 --> 00:06:59,941
OBITO (VOICEOVER):
I'm nothing but talk.

89
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:03,274
Somebody always has to
come along and save me.

90
00:07:03,307 --> 00:07:06,807
I'm just a big talking loser.

91
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:13,874
But I believe that the
White Fang was a true hero.

92
00:07:13,907 --> 00:07:16,007
Those who would abandon
even one of their friends

93
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,941
are far worse than scum.

94
00:07:18,974 --> 00:07:21,341
Those things I said,
I'm going to make

95
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,941
sure they're more
than just words.

96
00:07:29,174 --> 00:07:29,841
STONE NINJA: Die!

97
00:07:34,841 --> 00:07:36,707
But-- [groans]

98
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:39,541
--there's no way that
you could have seen me.

99
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:41,507
-Obito, how did--

100
00:07:49,374 --> 00:07:50,574
-[groans]

101
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:51,807
Those eyes.

What, ah--

103
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,774
-This time, I will
protect my comrade!

104
00:08:05,574 --> 00:08:08,707
-Obito, your eyes have changed.

105
00:08:08,741 --> 00:08:09,574
-Yeah.

106
00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:11,741
I guess my Sharingan awakened.

107
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:15,774
Now, I can see the movement
and flow of chakra.

-Yeah.

111
00:08:21,207 --> 00:08:24,674
But it looks like my left
eye is gone for good.

112
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:29,041
Never mind, I can use this kit
Rin gave me to fix myself up.

113
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:31,141
We have to save her.

114
00:08:31,174 --> 00:08:31,641
-Right!

115
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:45,574
-You're certainly
stubborn, aren't you?

116
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:48,974
[whoosh]

117
00:08:49,615 --> 00:08:50,082
Hm?

[grunts]

119
00:08:54,515 --> 00:08:55,315
Pathetic.

He can't even handle two kids.

121
00:09:04,615 --> 00:09:06,649
-Rin's chakra has
been disturbed.

122
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:10,349
It's flowing in patterns
different from yours and mine.

123
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:12,649
-She's probably
under a genjutsu.

124
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:15,649
They didn't want to waste time
getting information out of her.

125
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:18,882
-Huh, it seems that these
two are more than mere brats

126
00:09:18,915 --> 00:09:20,182
after all.

127
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:21,482
-We fought earlier.

128
00:09:21,515 --> 00:09:23,849
He's quick, so be careful.

129
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:24,349
-Gotcha.

130
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:05,849
-Release!

131
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:08,682
-Kakashi, Obito.

132
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:10,315
-We came to rescue you, Rin.

133
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:11,249
So don't worry.

134
00:10:11,282 --> 00:10:13,149
You're going to
be just fine now.

135
00:10:13,182 --> 00:10:14,615
-All right, let's
get out of here.

136
00:10:20,482 --> 00:10:22,649
-You know, you two
make a good team.

137

But you're still just brats.

Remember, you're standing in
the palm of your enemy now.

I'm going to make it.

No!

170
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,860
No!

171
00:12:19,894 --> 00:12:22,894
If only I'd come with you from
the start like you told me to,

172
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:25,094
this never would have happened.

[sobs]

174
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:34,894
So what if I'm captain now?

175
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:38,194
So what if I made Jonin.

176
00:12:38,227 --> 00:12:40,027
-Oh, that's right.

177
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:48,694
I totally forgot that I was the
only one who didn't give you

178
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:55,394
a gift for becoming a Jonin
and being named captain.

179
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:57,327
-Huh?

180
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,727
OBITO: I thought about it.

181
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,460
And I didn't know
what would be good.

182
00:13:03,494 --> 00:13:06,127
But I do now.

183
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,427
Don't worry.

184
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,727
I remember what you said before.

185
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,560
I'm not going to give
you something useless.

186
00:13:17,294 --> 00:13:23,627
I am giving you my Sharingan.

187
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,127
-Uh!

188
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:30,360
-Whatever the village
or anyone else may say,

189
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:34,160
I think that you're
a great Jonin.

190
00:13:34,194 --> 00:13:35,627
It's true.

191
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,094
That's how I really feel.

192
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:39,960
Please accept this.

193
00:13:44,527 --> 00:13:49,927
Rin, please use your
medical ninjutsu

194
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,494
and have my Sharingan,
the whole eye,

195
00:13:54,527 --> 00:13:58,794
transplant it to
Kakashi's left eye.

196
00:13:58,827 --> 00:14:00,727
-Kakashi, come quick.

197
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,627
We have to do this now.

198
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,594
-Huh.

199
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:08,894
-I'm about to die.

200
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:12,794
I'll be your eye,
keeping watch over what

201
00:14:12,827 --> 00:14:14,460
the future brings for you.

202
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:25,727
-Huh?

203
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,360
Still alive, huh?

204
00:14:33,394 --> 00:14:34,894
Man, you're stubborn, kid.

205
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,027
But then you are just a brat.

206
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,527
A real shinobi doesn't cry.

207
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,027
Let's settle this,
you big crybaby.

208
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:55,494
Huh?

something different
about him now.

00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,394
-Kakashi, take care of Rin.

212
00:15:16,427 --> 00:15:17,394
-I will.

-Kakashi, take Rin and
get her away from here.

218

Hurry.

219
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,960
Go now.

220
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:37,594
Enemy reinforcements
are coming soon.

OBITO: It's OK.

223
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:43,594
Just go.

224
00:16:46,627 --> 00:16:47,094
-Rin.

225
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:56,594
Huh!

OBITO (VOICEOVER):
Just when Kakashi and I

232
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:28,994
were starting to get along.

233
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:34,960
And I never got to tell
Rin that I love her.

234
00:17:34,994 --> 00:17:38,860
I just wish that I could have
spent more time with everyone.

235
00:17:45,427 --> 00:17:45,860
-Obito!

236
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,294
[gasping]

237
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:06,794
-Huh!

238
00:18:13,294 --> 00:18:17,494
-[gasping]

239
00:18:17,527 --> 00:18:17,994
No!

240
00:18:23,094 --> 00:18:26,660
Obito, you helped me
perfect this jutsu.

241
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:31,960
-Well, well.

242
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:35,460
So he can still find the will
to fight even facing these odds.

243
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:37,527
With that determination,
it's no wonder

244
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,460
he'd gotten so far
into our territory.

245
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:42,327
He's got nerve.

246
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,460
-Rin, I'll hold them off.

247
00:18:44,494 --> 00:18:45,827
You go, now!

248
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,160
-But you--

249
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:49,927
-I gave my word to Obito
that I'd protect you.

250
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,227
And I will, even if it kills me.

251
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,660
-Kakashi.

252
00:18:56,694 --> 00:19:00,027
-Rin, Obito truly
cared about you.

253
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,360
He loved you.

254
00:19:01,394 --> 00:19:04,060
You were everything
in the world to him.

255
00:19:04,094 --> 00:19:07,127
And that's why he gave
his life to protect you.

256
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,027
-Then Kakashi, you need to
know my feelings for you, too.

257
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,627
-I-- I deserted you.

258
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,127
I'm nothing but scum.

259
00:19:31,227 --> 00:19:32,127
Rin, go!

260
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,127
Am I dead now?

261
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,527
Where am I?

262
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,660
-Hm, looks like you're
back among us again.

263
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,760
-Sensei?

264
00:19:56,794 --> 00:19:58,227
But how?

265
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,160
-The jutsu formula on this.

266
00:20:00,194 --> 00:20:01,794
It acts as a location
marker for when

267
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:04,494
I use the Transportation
Technique.

268
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:06,760
-And the enemy?

269
00:20:06,794 --> 00:20:08,894
-I dealt with all of them.

270
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:10,560
-Huh?

271
00:20:10,594 --> 00:20:11,960
What about Rin?

272
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:12,694
Where is she?

273
00:20:17,394 --> 00:20:20,894
-I'm sorry that I couldn't
make it in time, Kakashi.

274
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:23,327
Rin told me everything
that happened.

275
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,294
OLD MAN (VOICEOVER): The
Third Great Ninja War.

276
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:43,660
With the sacrifices of
many nameless shinobi,

277
00:20:43,694 --> 00:20:46,860
the protracted war
finally came to a close.

278
00:20:46,894 --> 00:20:50,760
In its wake, it left
behind legends-- stories

279
00:20:50,794 --> 00:20:55,560
of great heroes to be told and
retold for generations to come.

280
00:20:55,594 --> 00:20:58,960
Legends such as the
battle of Kannabi bridge.

281
00:20:58,994 --> 00:21:03,127
That day, two heroes were born
in the Hidden Leaf Village,

282
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,294
each with his own Sharingan.

283
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:08,527
One found his name engraved
on the memorial stone.

284
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,760
And the other became known
as Kakashi of the Sharingan.

285
00:21:12,794 --> 00:21:15,727
In time, the tales
of his bravery

286
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,494
spanned all borders and beyond.

287
00:21:31,555 --> 00:21:34,121
[music playing]

288
00:23:02,356 --> 00:23:05,556
-Capturing Itachi
Uchiha, without a doubt,

289
00:23:05,589 --> 00:23:07,589
it won't be an easy mission.

290
00:23:07,622 --> 00:23:10,589
NARUTO: But this is
something that I have to do.

291
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,622
KAKASHI: To bring
back Sasuke, huh?

292
00:23:12,656 --> 00:23:13,989
NARUTO: Yeah.

293
00:23:14,022 --> 00:23:16,189
KAKASHI: You probably know this,
but he's now powerful enough

294
00:23:16,222 --> 00:23:18,522
to kill even Orochimaru.

295
00:23:18,556 --> 00:23:20,089
NARUTO: Yeah, I know.

296
00:23:20,122 --> 00:23:21,722
But I gave my word.

297
00:23:21,756 --> 00:23:24,422
And once I do, I
never go back on it.

298
00:23:24,456 --> 00:23:26,989
That's my ninja way.

299
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:29,456
Next time, "Assemble."
