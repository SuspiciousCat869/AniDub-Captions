00:00:14,374 --> 00:00:17,817
{\an1}The war we're facing...
is an unknown.

2
00:00:19,688 --> 00:00:24,533
{\an4}Shikamaru, I'm really
going to need you in
charge, out there on the
front lines.

3
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:25,837
Right.

4
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,944
{\an1}I'm counting on that
sharp intellect of yours.

5
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,842
Hmmm...

6
00:00:55,413 --> 00:00:58,387
{\an1}<i>Shikamaru...? It's your</i>

7
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,457
{\an1}Uh!

8
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:06,374
{\an7}Your mind is somewhere
else. Are you scared?

9
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:16,299
{\an7}No, I'm not scared. But
one bad decision, and my
comrades could die...

10
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:20,310
{\an7}So what do I do? What can
I do?

11
00:01:20,344 --> 00:01:22,114
{\an7}I just have doubts.

12
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:25,222
Hmmm...

13
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,202
{\an1}<i>It appears that you're</i>

14
00:01:30,235 --> 00:01:31,272
{\an1}Hmm?

16
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,863
{\an4}<i>Repetition. When each</i>

17
00:01:40,897 --> 00:01:45,441
{\an4}<i>Which means that four</i>
<i>consecutive occurances</i>

<i>a draw.</i>

18
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:52,459
Don't lose sight of
your goal. Go see Naruto.

19
00:01:56,269 --> 00:01:57,873
{\an1}There's a supply mission.

20
00:01:57,907 --> 00:01:58,843
{\an1}Hm?

21
00:01:59,377 --> 00:02:02,485
{\an1}I think it will be a nice
diversion for you.

22
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:05,894
{\an1}You should go. I'll
recommend you for it.

23
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:08,468
Mm.

24
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:54,908
{\an1}"The Closed Route"

{\an1}<i>This place is so quiet!</i>

26
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:23,949

27
00:04:23,983 --> 00:04:27,959
{\an4}The large coral reef
that's around Mokuzu
Island acts as a natural
breakwater.

28
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:32,537
{\an1}So this is an ideal
harbor, with very gentle
waves and little undertow.

29
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:35,145
{\an1}Yeah! The sea looks like
a mirror!

30
00:04:36,682 --> 00:04:39,790
{\an1}Hmmm... but
having said that...

31
00:04:55,297 --> 00:04:58,672
{\an1}I don't think that we
should linger here too
long.

32
00:04:58,705 --> 00:04:59,607
{\an1}Hm?

33
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:11,839
{\an1}Hard-a-port!

34
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:25,575
Aw! Really?!

35
00:05:25,609 --> 00:05:30,387
{\an7}Come on! But tasting
local delicacies is half
the fun of traveling!

36
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,230
The sun's gonna set any
second now!

37
00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:38,073
{\an1}Why are we setting sail
without even docking?

38
00:05:38,107 --> 00:05:42,050
{\an1}He may be the village
hero now, but he's still
the same Naruto.

39
00:05:42,818 --> 00:05:46,529
How can you be so
carefree these days?

40
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:48,935
{\an1}Did you say something?

41
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:52,009
Forget about it. It
doesn't matter...

42
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:58,292
{\an1}Why were you guys waiting
for us at Mokuzu Island,
anyway?

43
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:00,532
{\an1}'Cause we're bringing you
supplies.

44
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:02,102
Bringing supplies?

45
00:06:04,642 --> 00:06:06,981
All right, I give up!
Where are they, then?!

46
00:06:07,014 --> 00:06:07,950

him onboard anywhere.

73

{\an4}Yeah! I don't feel
seasick at all today.

up!

{\an7}<i>No, it's the real thing,</i>
<i>all right. It could be</i>
<i>the Transportation</i>
<i>Technique.</i>

155
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:42,809
{\an7}<i>No... </i>

156
00:14:42,842 --> 00:14:48,022
{\an7}<i>A shinobi capable of a</i>
<i>massive spatial barrier</i>
<i>like this wouldn't need</i>
<i>to bother forcing us to</i>

157
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:49,659
{\an7}<i>use up our chakra. </i>

158
00:14:50,596 --> 00:14:52,399
My chakra's all gone.

159
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,005
Huh?

160
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:55,809
{\an1}What?! Again?!

161
00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:01,724
{\an1}That's number four...

162
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:06,470
{\an1}This is just like the
Repetition move...

163
00:15:06,503 --> 00:15:08,173
Guy Sensei!

164
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:11,382
{\an1}It's hopeless! We're all
out of steam!

165
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:13,220
{\an1}I thought so...

166
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,534
[grunting]

167
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:21,074
{\an7}<i>This is a drag.</i>

168
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:25,920
{\an1}But I'm the only one
left.

169
00:15:33,072 --> 00:15:39,220
{\an7}With my jutsu,
controlling a ship this
size sure won't be easy,
but then again...

170
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:42,663
{\an1}[grunting]
I have no choice!

171
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:49,647
{\an8}Shikamaru... I don't
expect anything like that
from you.

172
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:50,951
{\an1}But why?!

173
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:53,157
[exhaling]

174
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,665
{\an7}You just leave the heavy
lifting to me!

175
00:15:56,699 --> 00:16:02,379
{\an7}And while I'm doing that,
your job is to use that
big brain of yours to
find a way to get us out

176
00:16:02,413 --> 00:16:03,850
{\an7}of this mess!

177
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:05,923
{\an7}Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

178
00:16:18,588 --> 00:16:23,836
{\an7}<i>Damn it, why was I so</i>
<i>impatient? Naruto is</i>
<i>absolutely right. </i>

179
00:16:27,846 --> 00:16:32,859
{\an7}<i>Okay, go through it in</i>
<i>order. What happened</i>
<i>after we left the port? </i>

180
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:37,103
{\an7}<i>As soon as we set sail,</i>
<i>we were surrounded by</i>
<i>thick fog. </i>

181
00:16:37,403 --> 00:16:41,046
{\an1}<i>We were on the ocean, but</i>
<i>Guy Sensei didn't get</i>
<i>seasick.</i>

182
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:43,753
{\an1}<i>And the compass didn't</i>
<i>work anymore. </i>

183
00:16:45,258 --> 00:16:50,337
{\an7}<i>Then, we sailed into an</i>
<i>uncharted reef system...</i>
<i>and that whirlpool</i>
<i>appeared.</i>

184
00:16:52,843 --> 00:16:58,424
{\an7}<i>Whirlpools are caused by</i>
<i>complex terrain on the</i>
<i>ocean floor and shifts</i>
<i>in the sea level.</i>

185
00:16:58,457 --> 00:16:59,493
{\an1}Huh?!

186
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:08,450
{\an7}<i>Damn it! Today is a</i>
<i>spring tide! And there's</i>
<i>that narrow entrance to</i>
<i>the bay... </i>

187
00:17:08,851 --> 00:17:14,366
{\an7}<i>A large amount of water</i>
<i>flowing in with the</i>
<i>spring tide will easily</i>
<i>form a whirlpool. </i>

188
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:17,707
{\an1}<i>Guy Sensei didn't get</i>
<i>seasick because- </i>

189
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,813
{\an1}This place is so quiet!

190
00:17:19,846 --> 00:17:26,129
{\an4}<i>The calm waves of that</i>
<i>huge bay kept the ship</i>
<i>steady. There's no doubt</i>
<i>about it.</i>

191
00:17:26,162 --> 00:17:29,070
{\an1}<i>Rock straight ahead! Grab</i>
<i>onto something! </i>

192
00:17:31,242 --> 00:17:32,579
{\an1}What's that...?

193
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,163
{\an3}Hmmm.

194
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,373
{\an3}Uh--

195
00:17:45,446 --> 00:17:48,253
{\an7}Wait, when did that mark
appear there?

196
00:17:48,286 --> 00:17:52,364
{\an1}So the ship rubbed up
against that over and
over...

197
00:17:52,397 --> 00:17:54,436
{\an1}And that means...

198
00:17:54,469 --> 00:17:59,549
{\an4}That this entire time,
we've only been going
around in circles inside
the bay!

199
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:01,420
Rasengan!

200
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:08,939
{\an1}I'm all out of chakra
now, too.

201
00:18:11,913 --> 00:18:13,918
{\an1}Another whirlpool!

202
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:16,493
{\an1}What?! Seriously?!

203
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:20,034
That's enough, Naruto.
I just got an idea.

204
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:23,309
{\an1}That's great. So what is
it? What do we have to
do?

205
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:27,420
{\an5}We're simply going to
sail straight into that
whirlpool and get
swallowed up by it.

206
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:28,322
We're what?!

207
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:30,595
{\an1}Wait, just what are
you up to, Shikamaru?

208
00:18:30,629 --> 00:18:34,505
{\an1}Tenten, I'm gonna need
your power for a bit.

209
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:35,608
{\an1}Huh?

210
00:18:46,235 --> 00:18:52,851
{\an7}About time! That's what
happens when you get
caught in the Devil's
Water Trap of Mokuzu Island!

211
00:18:54,756 --> 00:18:57,063
{\an1}At last, those shinobi
are all dead!

212
00:18:57,096 --> 00:19:00,906
{\an1}Their ship was swallowed
by the whirlpool and sent
to the sea floor!

213
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,914
{\an1}All right! Operation
complete!

214
00:19:03,947 --> 00:19:06,254
[cheering]

215
00:19:13,372 --> 00:19:17,415
{\an1}This is a big one! Let's
go get that shinobi
treasure!

216
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,287
[cheering]

217
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,998
Huh?!

218
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:27,875
What gives? There's
no debris anywhere!

219
00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:32,655
{\an1}Oh! Maybe the treasure
was so heavy that
everything just sank!

220
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:34,259
[laughing]

221
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:38,837
{\an1}So every one of you on
Mokuzu Island is a thief,
is that right?

222
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,439
[gasping]

223
00:19:39,472 --> 00:19:41,310
{\an1}What is-?! Who're you?!

224
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:46,490
{\an4}If you want our treasure
so badly, then you'll
have to come and take it
from us.

225
00:19:46,523 --> 00:19:47,960
[growling]

226
00:19:47,993 --> 00:19:48,996
Hmm.

227
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:58,654
{\an1}Don't be afraid! They're
completely exhausted from
handling all our traps!

228
00:19:58,689 --> 00:20:01,429
{\an1}Don't underestimate us!
Tenten!

229
00:20:01,462 --> 00:20:02,565
Right!

230
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,022
[gasping]

231
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:16,868
[screaming]

232
00:20:20,343 --> 00:20:22,248
[gasping]

233
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:26,828
{\an1}That was a pretty clever
trap for amateurs.

234
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:38,925
[gagging]

235
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:42,735
{\an1}Damn it! I'm seasick
again!

236
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:46,009
Shikamaru!

237
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:50,254
It's a good thing we can
rely on that sharp
intellect of yours!

238
00:20:50,287 --> 00:20:51,525
{\an1}Uh?

239
00:20:56,135 --> 00:20:57,171
{\an1}Hm!

240
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:59,176
{\an1}Y'know, I'm glad I met
you.

241
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,581
Huh? What?

242
00:21:00,614 --> 00:21:05,159
{\an1}It's nothing. Just forget
I said anything.

243
00:21:05,192 --> 00:21:06,161
{\an3}Hm?!

244
00:21:06,194 --> 00:21:08,835
Hey! Come on, tell me
what you just said!

245
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:10,104
{\an1}Tell me, already,
will ya?

246
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:13,982
{\an1}Knock it off! Man, you
can be such a pest
sometimes!

247
00:21:14,015 --> 00:21:16,689
{\an1}<i>What?! I'm a pest?! What</i>
<i>do you mean by that?! </i>

248
00:21:16,722 --> 00:21:17,625
<i>[sighing]</i>

249
00:21:17,658 --> 00:21:19,797
{\an1}<i>Don't just sigh at me!</i>
<i>Tell me! </i>

250
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,468
[sighing]

251
00:21:21,501 --> 00:21:23,006
[retching]

252
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,888
{\an1}<i>So Barbe-Q reopened? </i>

253
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:03,264
{\an1}<i>I made us a reservation!</i>
<i>Ooh! Beef tongue with</i>
<i>salt! </i>

254
00:23:03,297 --> 00:23:07,039
The new menu has a
special Ladies Combo!
It's such a good deal!

255
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:09,346
And I just can't resist
a good deal!

256
00:23:09,411 --> 00:23:12,019
{\an1}Frankly, my favorite here
is the offal!

257
00:23:12,052 --> 00:23:15,762
{\an1}<i>Did you decide on drinks?</i>
<i>Excuse me! We're ready</i>
<i>to order! </i>

258
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:21,577
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: The Girls Get</i>
<i>Together. </i>

259
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,715
{\an1}I'm going to eat
my fill tonight!
