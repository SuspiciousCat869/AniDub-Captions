00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:30,380
{\an1}-Well, the rumor is that enemy
spies were discovered out

10
00:00:30,413 --> 00:00:31,482
there.

to kill one of them

{\an1}and bring the body back here.

13
00:00:35,586 --> 00:00:37,721

should warn the students

{\an1}that they shouldn't go
near the back hills today.

-But this time
it'll be different.

47
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:57,816
{\an1}If I bring something
back from out here,

48
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,753
{\an1}then I'm finally going
to have some friends who

49
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:00,787
will accept me.

50
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,357
{\an1}If I do that I won't
be alone anymore.

51
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,326

an outsider anymore.

{\an1}In that case, Clone Jutsu!

be the most pathetic excuse

{\an1}for a clone I've ever seen.

{\an1}Leave the kid with
us and get lost.

I'm in charge of
this child's safety.

have such a lame student.

{\an1}Now you'll pay for his
stupidity with your life.

{\an1}-Difficult children are
just more rewarding.

{\an1}Besides, you won't be able
to defeat me that easily.

00:12:11,246 --> 00:12:13,415
{\an1}-Kakashi, what are
you doing here?

00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:14,950
{\an1}-Your students told
me what happened.

227
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:17,120
{\an1}And I got a little concerned.

228
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,922
{\an1}Dammit, he's got got backup.

-So what?

230
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:23,227
We'll get rid of
them with Fire Style.

00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:41,014

{\an1}-Thanks a lot Kakashi.

{\an1}I don't know what
would've happened

00:12:52,294 --> 00:12:54,364
{\an1}if you hadn't shown
up when you did.

242
00:12:54,397 --> 00:12:56,699
{\an1}-I'm confident that you
would have kept Naruto safe,

243
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:58,768
{\an1}even if I hadn't been here.

244
00:12:58,802 --> 00:13:01,238
{\an1}-Mm, you gave me good advice.

245
00:13:01,272 --> 00:13:03,174

-You were right.

248
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:10,216
{\an1}I should have tried to be honest
with him right from the start.

249
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,285
{\an1}I probably tried to
turn my back on him

250
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:13,686
so I could avoid
my own feelings.

251
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:17,558
{\an1}But I think that I can
finally face him now.

252
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,694
{\an1}-I see, that's good.

253
00:13:20,727 --> 00:13:21,196
-Thanks.

254
00:13:29,605 --> 00:13:33,577
{\an1}-This map details The Leaf
Village's patrol network.

255
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:36,613
{\an1}So this is what they
were trying to get then?

256
00:13:36,646 --> 00:13:37,814
-Yes.

257
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:39,117
-Excellent work.

258
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,019
{\an1}I'll have the patrol unit
reexamine their village sentry

259
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:43,856
{\an1}patterns right away.

260
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,492
-Please do.

261
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,992
{\an1}-It was coincidence.

262
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:49,262
But even so, it
appears that Naruto

263
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,197
{\an1}has saved the entire village.

264
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,966
{\an1}You may leave now.

265
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:53,601
-Yes sir.

266
00:13:58,406 --> 00:13:59,707
-What is it?

267
00:13:59,741 --> 00:14:03,879
-Lord Hokage, I
just-- I just wanted

268
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:07,417
{\an1}to thank you for placing
me in charge of Naruto sir.

269
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:08,684
-Hmm?

270
00:14:08,718 --> 00:14:10,587
-It's because of
that assignment I

271
00:14:10,621 --> 00:14:12,689
remembered why I
wanted to do this,

272
00:14:12,723 --> 00:14:15,160
{\an1}why I wanted to be a teacher.

273
00:14:15,193 --> 00:14:16,528
It all started
with something you

274
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:19,598
{\an1}told me, Lord Hokage,
a long, long time ago.

275
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:26,540
[sobbing]

276
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:30,111
{\an1}-It's hard to believe
it's been a year already.

277
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:31,379
{\an1}You're very brave.

278
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,215
{\an1}It's hard to do that, to
hide sadness behind laughter.

279
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,922
Your instructors
have been telling me

280
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:42,358
{\an1}that you're among the most
playful of all their students

281
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:44,194
and that you're
always so full of fun.

282
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,767
-You're wrong!

283
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,404
{\an1}I'm not sad about anything!

284
00:14:52,437 --> 00:14:57,243
{\an1}It's a noble thing to die in
the line of duty, isn't it?

285
00:14:57,276 --> 00:15:00,880
{\an1}My parents both gave their
lives to protect this place

286
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:02,583
{\an1}from the fox demon!

287
00:15:02,616 --> 00:15:03,550
They're heroes!

288
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:05,420
{\an1}I'm the son of those
revered heroes.

289
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:09,157
{\an1}I'm not even sad because they
went and left me all alone.

290
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,526
If I cry it's
because I'm proud--

291
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,827
{\an1}-It's all right Iruka.

292
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,964
{\an1}I know that somewhere
inside of you

293
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:19,903
{\an1}there's a boy curled
up in a ball of pain.

294
00:15:19,936 --> 00:15:24,342
{\an1}But remember this,
you are not alone.

295
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,111
{\an1}Inside every ninja
of The Hidden Leaf,

296
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:28,779
{\an1}there burns the Will of Fire.

297
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,319
{\an1}-The Will of Fire?

298
00:15:33,353 --> 00:15:37,757
{\an1}-It's what gives us the
strength to defend our village.

299
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,696
{\an1}It's the unbreakable bond
the ties us all together.

300
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,332
{\an1}It's what makes us a family.

301
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:48,937
{\an1}(LAUGHING) I wonder, do you
have it yet, young as you are?

302
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,579
-I think so.

303
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:02,587
{\an1}I wish to pass on
the Will of Fire

304
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:08,827
{\an1}to the children of the future,
to children like Naruto.

305
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:11,331
-Huh.

306
00:16:11,364 --> 00:16:13,967
{\an1}-Aw, come on Sensei,
give me a break.

307
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,835
{\an1}How could you have
lost that kunai?

308
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:16,337
-You

309
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,738
-Idiot

310
00:16:17,772 --> 00:16:20,575
-Ah!

311
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:21,876
{\an1}-Are you kidding?

312
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:25,380
{\an1}You almost lost your life
today because of that thing.

313
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:28,051
{\an1}-Yeah, that's true, but--

314
00:16:28,084 --> 00:16:30,887
{\an1}-Huh, you seem quiet today.

315
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,723
{\an1}-That's because this
is the first time

316
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:34,825
{\an1}that you've actually
yelled at me Sensei.

317
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:36,728
{\an1}I'm just surprised.

318
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:38,330
-Yelled at you?

319
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:39,765
I guess I did.

320
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,000
That's because I
decided I'm going

321
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:44,837
{\an1}to be more honest and
upfront with you from now on.

322
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,408
{\an1}Starting tomorrow, I'm going
to be harder on you than ever.

323
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:49,810
-Huh?

324
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:53,880
{\an1}If that's how it's going to be
I'm never going back to school.

325
00:16:53,914 --> 00:16:58,019
{\an1}-Naruto, do you have
the Will of Fire in You

326
00:16:58,052 --> 00:17:00,289
{\an1}-The Will of Fire, what is that?

327
00:17:00,322 --> 00:17:02,726
It's the strong
will to do whatever

328
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,595
{\an1}it takes to protect the
Leaf Village no matter what.

329
00:17:05,628 --> 00:17:07,732
{\an1}If you have it, then
you can become as strong

330
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:08,965
{\an1}as the Lord Hokage.

331
00:17:08,998 --> 00:17:09,933
-The Hokage?

332
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:12,303
Is he really as
strong as they say?

333
00:17:12,336 --> 00:17:13,572
-He is.

334
00:17:13,605 --> 00:17:16,007
{\an1}But he's got more
than just strength.

335
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,345
{\an1}Lord Hokage has the respect
of everyone in the village

336
00:17:19,379 --> 00:17:21,147
{\an1}because he's a great leader.

337
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,050
{\an1}The fourth Hokage was a hero
who protected the village

338
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,319
{\an1}from the Nine-tailed fox.

339
00:17:25,352 --> 00:17:28,188
-A hero?

340
00:17:28,222 --> 00:17:29,624
That's it then.

341
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:33,595
{\an1}I'm going to be an even stronger
Hokage than the fourth Hokage.

342
00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:35,731
{\an1}And then everyone
in the village will

343
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:37,700
{\an1}have to acknowledge
how great I am.

344
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:38,200
-Hmm.

345
00:17:43,907 --> 00:17:47,311
{\an1}-Well, my guess is, that by the
time you're about this tall,

346
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:48,946
{\an1}you might be able
to become Hokage.

347
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:54,219
{\an1}-OK, then I'll work just as
hard I can until that day comes.

348
00:17:57,724 --> 00:18:07,769
{\an1}-Naruto-- I believe you really
might become Hokage one day.

349
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:12,974
{\an1}-Naruto-- I believe you really
might become Hokage one day.

350
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:17,146
{\an1}-Iruka Sensei, could you
give us a hand with this?

351
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,315
{\an1}-Yeah, sure thing.

352
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:19,149
I'm on my way.

353
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:28,894
[sighs]

354
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:36,002
{\an1}-Where had Suigetsu gone?

355
00:18:36,036 --> 00:18:37,237
-Suigetsu?

356
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,507
{\an1}huh, he went out two
or three days ago

357
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,209
{\an1}and hasn't bothered
to come back yet.

358
00:18:41,242 --> 00:18:44,713
{\an1}To tell you the truth, I don't
care if he ever comes back.

359
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:48,016
{\an1}-I heard that, you know?

360
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,353
{\an1}-The executioner's blade?

361
00:18:50,386 --> 00:18:52,957
{\an1}You went all the way back
to get that old thing?

362
00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:54,725
{\an1}-Well, you left it behind.

363
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,228
{\an1}It was a real pain to get back.

364
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,030
{\an1}-I had better things to do
than worry about your stuff

365
00:19:00,064 --> 00:19:01,666
{\an1}when we fought the
Eight-tails, OK?

366
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,936
{\an1}-Yeah, well, I carried the
two of you out of there

367
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,170
{\an1}when you were dying.

368
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:07,072
{\an1}So quit fighting.

369
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:08,876
{\an1}-Oh, patronize me why don't ya?

370
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:12,246
{\an1}-Yeah, whatever, I'm just
glad I have this baby back

371
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:12,880
{\an1}where it belongs.

372
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:18,152
{\an1}I'm incomplete without it.

373
00:19:18,186 --> 00:19:20,723
-Now that all of
us are here, it's

374
00:19:20,756 --> 00:19:22,324
{\an1}time to get ready to leave.

375
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:23,459
-Huh?

376
00:19:23,492 --> 00:19:25,060
{\an1}You're all healed up?

377
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:27,364
-Yeah.

378
00:19:27,397 --> 00:19:29,399
{\an1}-We're heading to The
Hidden Leaf Village.

379
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,311
-And that's it.

380
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,015
{\an1}-I never imagined Pain
would be defeated.

381
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,617
{\an1}-This is most unexpected.

382
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:47,353
{\an1}-And Konan's not coming
back here either.

383
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:48,455
{\an1}-What should we do?

384
00:19:48,489 --> 00:19:51,325
{\an1}So many of our members are gone.

385
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,227
{\an1}-We need more palms
to synchronize

386
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,665
{\an1}with the Gedo statute again.

387
00:19:56,698 --> 00:20:01,404
{\an1}Kisame, you go track
down the Eight-tails.

388
00:20:01,437 --> 00:20:03,006
-What about you?

389
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,174
{\an1}-I have some other
business to attend to.

390
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:22,362
{\an1}-This is much worse
than I imagined.

391
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:24,799
-You're late.

392
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:26,166
{\an1}-Did Naruto do all this?

393
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:29,570
{\an1}-No, it was all Pain's doing.

394
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:30,072
-What?

395
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:30,906
Pain?

396
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,542
{\an1}-Yeah, but Naruto handled it.

397
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:35,612
{\an1}He defeated pain by himself.

398
00:20:35,645 --> 00:20:36,512
-He did?

399
00:20:36,546 --> 00:20:38,281
{\an1}What about the Nine-tails?

400
00:20:38,314 --> 00:20:41,785
{\an1}-Naruto was able to
control it all on his own.

401
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:42,786
[sighs]

402
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,254
{\an1}-Well, that's good news.

403
00:20:44,288 --> 00:20:47,224
{\an1}Oh, wait-- Naruto controlled
the Nine-tails on his own?

404
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:49,561
{\an1}-There's no time to
worry about that now.

405
00:20:49,594 --> 00:20:51,931
{\an1}We have to focus on
rebuilding the village.

406
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:53,933
{\an1}It's going to be hard work.

407
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:57,269
{\an1}Yamato, we're going to need
all the help you can give us.

408
00:20:57,303 --> 00:21:00,108
-Right.

409
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,643
-What is it?

410
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:03,578
-An emergency
council's been called.

411
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:05,814
As Jounin squad
leader, you're required

412
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,516
{\an1}to be there, Lord Shikaku.

413
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,220
-Already?

414
00:21:11,253 --> 00:21:12,689
All right then.

415
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:25,771
[theme music]

416
00:22:56,011 --> 00:22:58,948
{\an1}KAKASHI HATAKE: So this
is where Naruto lives.

417
00:22:58,982 --> 00:23:00,083
-He's a fool.

418
00:23:00,116 --> 00:23:02,552
{\an1}But it would be best if
you looked after him.

419
00:23:02,585 --> 00:23:03,821
-Sure.

420
00:23:03,854 --> 00:23:06,824
{\an1}-He'll be on your team,
along with Sakura and Sasuke.

421
00:23:06,857 --> 00:23:08,325
{\an1}KAKASHI HATAKE: I'm
not naive enough

422
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:11,296
{\an1}to go easy on them because
of personal feelings.

423
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:13,065
{\an1}-I wish you the best of luck.

424
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:14,901
{\an1}You're Going to need it.

425
00:23:14,934 --> 00:23:18,872
{\an1}NARUTO: Next time on Naruto:
Shippuden, Kakashi Hatake,

426
00:23:18,906 --> 00:23:20,406
{\an1}the Jounin in Charge.

427
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:23,343
{\an1}-This looks like it's
going to be troublesome.
