have to work with that guy?

00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:07,378

{\an3}Hmm?

11
00:02:15,252 --> 00:02:18,688
{\an1}By "Kakashi..." do you mean
Kakashi Hatake?

12
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:19,855
{\an1}What?

{\an1}Who are you, kid?

00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:24,527
{\an1}Kakashi and I were both
students together at the
Academy.

00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,296
{\an1}Oh... so you guys were
friends, huh?

16
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:30,266
{\an1}Well... I wouldn't call us
"friends", exactly.

17
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:31,600

22
00:02:42,776 --> 00:02:44,712
{\an1}So did something bad happen?

23
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:48,181
{\an7}It's just that he always
prioritizes the mission over
everything else, even if a

24
00:02:48,215 --> 00:02:49,484
{\an7}teammate gets hurt...

25
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:52,419
{\an7}...or if someone's left
behind in enemy territory.

26
00:02:52,452 --> 00:02:55,289
{\an1}There's just no way that we
can work with somebody like
that.

27
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:59,293
{\an7}If you ever have to team up
with him, be sure you watch
your back.

what... That's my Ninja Way.

[chatting]

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,517
{\an1}Hey, Rin... You seen much of
Kakashi lately?

33
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,518
{\an1}Mm-mm.

34
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:31,888
{\an1}I've only caught glimpses of
him around town. I think
that he's been out of the

35
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:33,890
{\an1}village on missions most of
the time.

36
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:35,892
Hmmm.

37
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,894
{\an1}Why do you ask?

38
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:42,699
{\an1}I heard some guys talking
about him yesterday. And it
wasn't very nice.

39
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:46,803
{\an1}And the last time I saw him,
he seemed to have changed a
lot, too.

40
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,841
{\an1}Do you think that all of
this could have something to
do with his father?

41
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,810
{\an1}Do you know something, Rin?

{\an1}Well, okay, Obito... See you
tomorrow!

{\an1}Hey, Kakashi! So, you been
doing okay?

49
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:36,013
{\an1}I've been hearing a whole
lot about you lately! Guess
you've been on a bunch of

50
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:37,649
missions, huh?

00:04:45,122 --> 00:04:48,693
{\an1}I'm not so desperate that I
need you to worry about me.

I'm gonna have to try a
whole lot harder if I'm

surprise him, big time.

76
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:11,902
{\an1}'Cause otherwise, I'm never
gonna be able to become
Hokage.

out on missions and
everything!

{\an1}I have to way work harder or
else the gap between us is
just gonna get bigger and

bigger!

it, Obito!

{\an1}I want to ask a favor of
you.

85
00:06:40,862 --> 00:06:43,698
{\an1}Kakashi's an extremely
talented shinobi.

86
00:06:44,465 --> 00:06:49,236
{\an1}However, he can be much too
fussy about sticking to the
rules, and on top of that he

87
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:53,507
{\an1}also frequently clashes with
his superiors and his
teammates.

88
00:06:53,773 --> 00:06:59,713
{\an1}He may excel in technique.
But as a person, I'm afraid
he has much to learn.

89
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,317
{\an1}His father broke the rules
to protect his comrades and
then took his own life.

90
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:09,522
{\an1}Seems his death has cast
quite a long shadow over
Kakashi.

91
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:10,555
You want...

92
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:13,391
{\an1}...me to supervise him?

people, you know that?

103
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:48,024

been getting ambushed by a

three-man squad and go on
missions, right?

00:10:10,787 --> 00:10:13,090
{\an1}We're going to begin our
first mission tomorrow.

152
00:10:13,123 --> 00:10:17,160
{\an1}All riiight! I finally
get to show what I can
do in a real battle!

153
00:10:17,192 --> 00:10:21,229
{\an1}Well, actually, this first
mission just takes place
inside the village.

154
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:24,266
{\an1}You'll be doing something
like finding a lost pet or
object.

155
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:25,333
{\an1}[grunting]

156
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:27,536
{\an1}That's just doing odd jobs!

157
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:30,204
{\an1}But even so, a mission is
still a mission.

158
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:34,208
{\an1}And if you succeed, I'll be
able to get you assigned to
more important missions.

159
00:10:35,242 --> 00:10:39,046
{\an1}Now, Kakashi, I know that
you've already been out on
many missions, so this kind

160
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,381
{\an1}of thing may seem a little
bit boring to you.

161
00:10:41,414 --> 00:10:42,717
{\an1}<i>But do your best. </i>

162
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,918
[sighing]

163
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:46,619
{\an1}Hey, Kakashi, I challenge
you!

164
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:47,487
{\an1}Huh?

165
00:10:48,855 --> 00:10:51,124
{\an1}Starting right now, let's
see who can complete more
missions.

166
00:10:51,157 --> 00:10:53,660
{\an1}That's stupid. Do what you
want.

167
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:55,061
{\an1}What, are you chicken?

168
00:10:55,095 --> 00:10:56,595
{\an1}What did you say?

169
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,201
It's not here.

170
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:05,536
{\an1}It's not here, either.

171
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,074
{\an1}Any luck?

172
00:11:09,108 --> 00:11:09,874
No.

173
00:11:10,908 --> 00:11:13,945
{\an1}Me, either. Finding a lost
pet isn't easy, is it?

174
00:11:14,244 --> 00:11:18,281
{\an1}But if we can't even succeed
at something as simple as
this... then our team is

175
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:20,852
{\an1}never going to be sent on
any real missions.

176
00:11:21,953 --> 00:11:24,188
{\an1}By the way, where's Obito?

177
00:11:24,955 --> 00:11:29,626
{\an1}He was really determined to
do everything all by himself,
so he ran off somewhere.

178
00:11:31,094 --> 00:11:33,662
{\an7}<i>Is he actually serious about</i>
<i>beating me? </i>

179
00:11:50,245 --> 00:11:53,081
{\an1}Oh, of course I'd love to
help you, Obito...

180
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,185
{\an1}That cat was on the rooftop
up ahead, just basking in
the sun.

181
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:01,889
{\an1}Yes, Obito. I saw that kitty
lying on a park bench!

182
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:06,760
{\an1}Oh, that's right! I almost
forgot that I have some yummy
sweets you can take with you!

183
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,363
[meowing]

184
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,833
{\an1}[chuckling] I found a lost
pet and a lost object!

185
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,369
{\an1}I completed both missions
thanks to grannies I'd
helped before.

186
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:19,105
And I even
got treats!

187
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,840
{\an1}You're sure popular with the
old ladies, Obito!

188
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:25,710
{\an1}I guess you really were
telling us the truth all those
times when you were late.

189
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:31,049
{\an1}They say that one good deed
deserves another. I guess the
kind deeds Obito did before

190
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:32,984
{\an1}were returned to him
this time.

191
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,685
{\an1}How's that, Kakashi?!

192
00:12:34,718 --> 00:12:36,821
Uh--[groaning]

193
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,525
Hmmm...

194
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:49,299
{\an1}Well, it appears that all of
the odd jobs in the Village
were taken care of in one day.

195
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:53,102
{\an1}That's right! 'Cause I'm the
guy who's gonna become
Hokage! This is nothing

196
00:12:53,136 --> 00:12:55,038
{\an1}compared to what I can
really do!

197
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:59,508
{\an1}Lord Hokage... If I may,
sir... I believe that this
team is far more skilled

198
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,109
{\an1}than we originally thought.

199
00:13:01,877 --> 00:13:03,444
{\an1}I believe you're right...

200
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:08,317
{\an1}Well, Kakashi already has
quite a lot of field
experience, so perhaps I'll

201
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:11,018
{\an1}send them along with you on
your mission tomorrow,
Minato.

202
00:13:11,052 --> 00:13:11,752
[gasping]

203
00:13:11,786 --> 00:13:13,554
{\an1}A mission with Minato
Sensei?!

204
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:15,623
{\an1}Wait, do you mean a real
mission?!

205
00:13:15,857 --> 00:13:19,826
{\an1}That's right. And the client
asked for Minato by name.

206
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,330
{\an1}The mission we're talking
about is C-rank.

207
00:13:22,362 --> 00:13:25,999
{\an1}Although the risk is low,
I'd be lying if I said there
wasn't any.

208
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:31,137
{\an1}I had originally planned to
assign more odd jobs in and
around the Village for you

209
00:13:31,171 --> 00:13:33,572
{\an1}to complete while Minato was
away.

210
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:38,177
{\an1}<i>But there simply aren't any</i>
<i>more of them left! And I</i>
<i>can't let you just while</i>

211
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,945
{\an1}<i>away the time doing nothing.</i>

212
00:13:40,713 --> 00:13:41,713
All right!

213
00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:45,416
{\an1}I guess this means that
we're going to get to go on
our first real mission.

214
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,552
Very good, then.

215
00:13:47,585 --> 00:13:49,554
{\an1}I'm counting on all of you!

216
00:13:49,587 --> 00:13:50,822
Yes, sir!

217
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:55,559
{\an1}Well, what do you say,
Kakashi?!

218
00:13:55,592 --> 00:13:59,663
{\an1}You should be grateful to me
for this mission. I'm the
only reason why there aren't

219
00:13:59,696 --> 00:14:01,899
{\an1}any more odd jobs to do in
the Village.

220
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:02,966
Hmph!

221
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:07,570
{\an1}Kakashi, don't be upset with
Obito, all right?

222
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:12,108
{\an1}He's been worried about you
for a long time, you know.
He's noticed that... well,

223
00:14:12,141 --> 00:14:13,509
{\an1}that you've changed...

224
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:14,409
{\an1}Huh?

225
00:14:14,442 --> 00:14:16,779
{\an1}Hey! What're you talking
about, Rin?!

226
00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:18,914
{\an1}Well, what I said is true,
isn't it?

227
00:14:18,948 --> 00:14:22,285
{\an1}And besides, you've always
said that Kakashi is better
than you!

228
00:14:22,318 --> 00:14:24,986
{\an1}I mean, that's why you
trained so hard by yourself,

229
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,487
{\an1}so you'd be able to
catch up to him!

230
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,488
{\an1}[grunting]

231
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:31,192
{\an1}No! I never said that!
You're imagining things!

232
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:38,032
{\an1}Look... let's all just shake
hands. We're on the same
team now, remember?

233
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:40,301
{\an1}I'm not shaking hands with
that guy!

234
00:14:41,302 --> 00:14:42,403
Really...

235
00:14:42,435 --> 00:14:44,437
You two are
both hopeless.

236
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,142
Well, then...

237
00:14:49,441 --> 00:14:51,978
{\an1}I'm just going to have to
connect the two of you!

238
00:14:57,783 --> 00:15:01,853
{\an1}Okay, guys, for this mission,
we'll be escorting some shinobi
from another village.

239
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,555
{\an1}<i>One of them's carrying a</i>
<i>secret missive. </i>

240
00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:07,125
{\an1}<i>And that's what we're</i>
<i>guarding. </i>

241
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:11,595
{\an1}<i>There will be three other</i>
<i>escorts from the village</i>
<i>that requested us.</i>

242
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:16,000
{\an1}<i>If any fighting breaks out,</i>
<i>first and foremost I want</i>
<i>you three to make sure that</i>

243
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:17,368
<i>you stay safe. </i>

244
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:18,702
<i>Understood? </i>

245
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:20,271
[chuckling]

246
00:15:20,304 --> 00:15:23,807
{\an1}All right! I'm gonna show
off my stuff big-time and
become the Hokage!

247
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,041
Just you watch!

248
00:15:25,075 --> 00:15:28,044
{\an7}It's not as if it's going to
be as easy as that, you
know...

249
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:32,481
{\an7}Obito, were you even
listening to Minato Sensei
at all? We're not supposed

250
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,216
{\an7}to engage in any kind of
fighting.

251
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:38,854
{\an7}And besides, even if we
did... we'd only get in
Minato Sensei's way.

252
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:41,323
{\an1}Seriously? Is he really that
amazing?

253
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:44,158
{\an1}Haven't you ever heard of
the Yellow Flash of the
Leaf?!

254
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,962
{\an7}I've sure heard of him!
Y'know, he's such an
incredible shinobi that his

255
00:15:47,996 --> 00:15:50,064
{\an7}fame's even spread to other
villages!

256
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:52,133
{\an1}<i>The Yellow Flash is Minato</i>
<i>Namikaze,</i>

<i>next in line to become</i>
<i>Hokage!</i>

258

{\an1}Whoa, really?! Somebody that
amazing is the one teaching
us?

259
00:15:58,739 --> 00:16:00,874
{\an1}I can feel my blood pumping
right now!

260
00:16:00,907 --> 00:16:03,642
{\an1}Man! I really wish that
someone would attack us.

261
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,777
{\an8}Damn it...

262
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:10,249
{\an1}Hey, you guys! I wonder
who's stronger... Do you
think it's the Yellow Flash

263
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:12,918
{\an1}of the Leaf... or the White
Fang of the Leaf?

264
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:13,585
[gasping]

265
00:16:13,618 --> 00:16:15,454
{\an1}Obito!

266
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:19,090
{\an1}Apparently, there was this
hero from the Hidden Leaf
who was given the nickname

267
00:16:19,124 --> 00:16:20,393
{\an1}"the White Fang!"

268
00:16:20,426 --> 00:16:23,561
{\an1}But I heard that he died
while he was protecting
the village.

269
00:16:23,595 --> 00:16:25,130
{\an1}Haven't you heard
of him?!

270
00:16:25,163 --> 00:16:26,064
No.

271
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:28,732
{\an1}Huh? Kakashi, what?

272
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:30,435
{\an1}What's gotten into him?

273
00:16:34,271 --> 00:16:35,239
Hmm?

<i>than this mission's rank... </i>

277
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,888
{\an7}<i>I have to stop them here</i>
<i>before we're completely</i>
<i>surrounded. </i>

278
00:16:54,257 --> 00:16:56,124
{\an7}<i>Bringing along the team</i>

279
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,728
{\an7}<i>Of those on the team... </i>

00:17:19,313 --> 00:17:20,780
{\an1}Uh, yes sir...

291
00:17:22,348 --> 00:17:26,618
{\an1}Now, there are quite a lot
of them. So Obito and I
are going to backtrack and

292
00:17:26,652 --> 00:17:27,953
{\an1}go to confront them.

293
00:17:27,987 --> 00:17:30,756
{\an1}In the meantime, Kakashi and
Rin will complete the
mission.

294
00:17:31,223 --> 00:17:34,026
{\an1}It's absolutely imperative
that both of you escape.

295
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:35,260
Yes, sir!

296
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:36,995
{\an1}Let's go, Obito!

297
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:37,996
Roger!

298
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:46,504
{\an7}Oh man, thank you, Minato
Sensei! I mean, to have you
pick me instead of Kakashi...

299
00:17:46,537 --> 00:17:50,475
{\an7}[chuckling] I guess it just
goes to show that I'm really
the one you depend on!

300
00:17:50,508 --> 00:17:54,278
{\an1}Obito, we're going to lure
the enemy away without a
fight in order to separate

301
00:17:54,312 --> 00:17:55,846
{\an1}them from the rest
of our people.

302
00:17:55,879 --> 00:17:57,481
{\an7}Yeah, I know that!

303
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:03,120
{\an1}Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu!

304
00:18:08,224 --> 00:18:09,825
{\an1}Hey! Not bad!

305
00:18:10,226 --> 00:18:12,627
{\an1}I wasn't kidding about
practicing every day!

306
00:18:12,962 --> 00:18:14,796
{\an1}I'll take down every one of
them!

307
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:17,299
{\an1}Don't get carried away! I
said no fight-

308
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:19,667
[grunting]

309
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:20,569
Obito!

310
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:24,939
Get back!

311
00:18:25,806 --> 00:18:29,277
[grunting]

312
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:32,547
Hmph.

313
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,680
{\an8}<i>He's strong! </i>

314
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:35,916
Ha! A kid?!

315
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,384
You're dead!!

316
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:40,554
{\an7}<i>Damn it! There's no way I'm</i>
<i>going to lose to this guy! </i>

317
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,524
I'm gonna...

318
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,793
{\an1}...become Hokage!

319
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,129
[grunting]

320
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:50,996
{\an8}<i>I did it! </i>

321
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:52,864
[chuckling]

322
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:54,799
[gasping]

323
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,368
{\an1}A shadow clone?!

324
00:19:00,838 --> 00:19:02,240
Gotcha!

325
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,008
{\an8}<i>Not good! </i>

326
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:09,713
[struggling]

327
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:15,718
{\an1}You all right, Obito?

328
00:19:15,985 --> 00:19:17,521
{\an1}Minato Sensei...!

329
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:29,097
{\an7}<i>This is really bad... </i>

330
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,339
{\an1}They're here. Rin! Go on
ahead!

331
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:38,706
{\an1}You got it.

332
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:42,977
[grunting]

333
00:19:47,081 --> 00:19:47,949
Damn--!

334
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:48,848
[wincing]

335
00:19:48,882 --> 00:19:50,351
[gasping]

336
00:19:50,384 --> 00:19:52,420
[falling]

337
00:19:52,453 --> 00:19:53,487
[gasping]

338
00:19:54,321 --> 00:19:56,056
Kakashi!

339
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:59,626
{\an1}We have to save him! Minato
Sensei is still nearby! If we
turn back and let him know--

340
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:02,795
{\an1}We can't! A shinobi's duty
is to complete his mission!

341
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:04,129
{\an1}Kakashi...

342
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:08,300
{\an1}Run! Escaping is imperative!
We just have to get to the
forest!

343
00:20:08,334 --> 00:20:11,136
{\an1}Then the Village will be too
close, and they'll turn
back!

344
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,239
Understood!

345
00:20:17,242 --> 00:20:21,479
[panting]

346
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,513
[panting]

347
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:25,250
{\an1}We should be safe here.

348
00:20:25,283 --> 00:20:26,551
{\an1}And Obito?

349
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:29,554
{\an1}Sensei's with him. I'm sure
they're fine.

350
00:20:29,587 --> 00:20:30,420
{\an1}Thank you.

351
00:20:32,055 --> 00:20:35,525
{\an1}I have to hand it to the
Yellow Flash's team. Now the
secret missive is sure to be

352
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,694
{\an1}delivered safely.

353
00:20:37,728 --> 00:20:42,198
{\an1}Don't mention it. It's just
too bad that one man had to
be sacrificed.

354
00:20:42,231 --> 00:20:44,533
{\an1}Yes... But that couldn't be
helped.

355
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:46,168
{\an1}[chuckling] Although...

356
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:47,936
{\an1}He won't be... the only
sacrifice!

357
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,770
Hmm?

358
00:20:48,803 --> 00:20:50,673
[yelling]

359
00:20:50,706 --> 00:20:51,206
[gasping]

360
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,173
What?!

361
00:20:53,141 --> 00:20:54,677
[collapsing]

362
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,810
{\an1}What's going on?

363
00:20:56,611 --> 00:21:02,116
{\an1}So... you're...the traitors,
huh?!

364
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,551
[gasping]

365
00:21:05,152 --> 00:21:08,689
{\an1}Because you were so focused
on making sure that your
mission was completed, you

366
00:21:08,723 --> 00:21:10,524
{\an1}made our mission all that
much easier.

367
00:21:10,557 --> 00:21:14,728
{\an7}[chuckling] Even the Yellow
Flash can't get this far
fast enough to save you.

368
00:21:14,927 --> 00:21:18,331
{\an7}Sorry, but you're gonna have
to die, too.

369
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:19,499
[grunting]

370
00:21:19,532 --> 00:21:20,667
{\an1}No way...

371
00:22:57,722 --> 00:23:01,058
{\an1}<i>Kakashi, you didn't leave</i>
<i>someone behind to die, did</i>
<i>you? </i>

372
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:04,361
{\an1}<i>All I did was prioritize the</i>
<i>mission. I just followed the</i>
<i>rules. </i>

373
00:23:04,729 --> 00:23:06,865
{\an1}<i>But look what happened</i>
<i>because of the rules! </i>

374
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:10,100
{\an7}<i>Stop, Obito. We couldn't</i>
<i>have known that this</i>
<i>would happen.</i>

375
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:11,702
{\an7}<i>Kakashi's not</i>
<i>to blame.</i>

376
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:13,169
{\an1}<i>Damn it. I'm leaving! </i>

377
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:14,805
{\an7}<i>Where are you going? </i>

378
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:19,642
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "You'll Be My</i>
<i>Backup" </i>

379
00:23:20,076 --> 00:23:23,011
{\an1}Isn't it obvious?! I'm gonna
go save that guy!
