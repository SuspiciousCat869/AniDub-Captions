TSUNADE: Hmm.

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,244
So you found no evidence
linking these incidents

4
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,445
to the Akatsuki.

5
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,046
-That's right.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,982
Nevertheless, it's bad.

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,384
And it's bound to
get a lot worse.

8
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:18,685
-Hmm.

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,356
-My lady, I'll never
forget what we found there.

10
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,491
In one night, the
whole village was

11
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,561
destroyed, along with
almost everyone in it.

12
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,349
-The Hidden Rain.

13
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,652
Then there were more
attacks, more villages

14
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,654
hit all along the border.

15
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:56,290
All of them Land
of Fire villages.

16
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,458
-Asuma, don't jump
to conclusions.

17
00:00:58,492 --> 00:00:59,993
-Yes, I understand.

18
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,729
But marking their targets
with the sign of the Hidden

19
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:06,333

that's hard to stomach.

20
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:10,537
-Could It be that someone
else is trying to start a war?

[gasps]

22
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,274
-Possibly.

23
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:18,312
But sometimes the most obvious
conclusion is the right one.

24
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:19,646
There's been no
news about what's

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,615
been going on with
the Hidden Rain?

26
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:22,382
-No.

27
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,717
Nothing at this point.

28
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,552
-Our main concern right now--

29
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,720
-Is the Land of Fire.

30
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,688
-Yes, my lady.

31
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,023
And the feudal lord.

32
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:33,994
-You think someone may be trying
to provoke a reaction from him.

33
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:36,096
Like with the Guardian
Shinobi 12 before.

34
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,368
That would play
right into the hands

35
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:45,272
of Danzo, the old leader
of the hard-line faction.

36
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:49,509
-Well, he's a cunning old
fox, you have to admit.

-Dispatch a reconnaissance team
of jonin and ANBU Black Ops

38

39
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,317
But since we don't yet
know the situation,

40
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:59,653
their mission is
to be kept secret.

41
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:02,122
And make sure they
know our village is not

42
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,024
to engage in any way.

43
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,227
I'll write to the feudal lord
of the Land of Fire myself.

44
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,261
-Right.

45
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,297
-Asuma, keep your
team ready to move out

46
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,432
the moment there are
any new developments.

47
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,034
Stand by until then.

48
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:14,601
-Understood.

49
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,602
Then I'll be going.

50
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,507
-Oh, excuse me.

Come to think of it,
didn't Asuma once--

56
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,000
-That's right.

57
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,636
When he was just a young
punk, no more than 20,

58
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:53,340
he got this notion in his head
and there was no stopping him.

59
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:57,177
He proclaimed, I'll do what I
have to for the Land of Fire.

60
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,380
Then he quarreled with the third
hokage and left the village.

Just another
father-son squabble,

62
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,650

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,985
-Ah.

64
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,620
-It was 10 years ago.

65
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:10,123
Some of the Guardian Shinobi 12
wanted to make the Land of Fire

66
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:13,560
a military power, so they
tried to stage a coup.

67
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:16,530
The 12 were split evenly in two.

68
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,699
Asuma joined the loyalists
and with his help,

69
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:21,334
the coup attempt was foiled.

70
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,071
NARUTO: Hey, Asuma-sensei.

00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,640
How's the training going?

73
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,543
-Well, actually, I haven't
had much time for training.

74
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,677
-I see.

75
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,046
So what are you doing here?

76
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,449
-Ah, Captain Yamato
told us to wait out here

77
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:36,516
until he calls us.

78
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,117
-Hmm?

look supposed to mean?

00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:52,999
-Sorry?

86
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,201
For what?

87
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,104
-So that's how all
this happened, huh?

88
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,239
-The ones who put an
end to the coup attempt

89
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:04,211
at the cost of their own
lives were Kitane, Naoma, Tou,

90
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,378
and Seito.

91
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,314
And it was their bodies
that were stolen.

92
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,316
-They were what?

93
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,118
-I'm so sorry, my lady.

94
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,120
The thieves that
stole them-- they

95
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:16,223
possessed Earth-Style Jutsu
that were surprisingly advanced.

96
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,526
-What could they want with the
bodies of the four Guardians?

97
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,062
Unless it's to learn the
secrets of the precious jutsu

98
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,430
that was buried with them.

99
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,632
If they spread to other
lands, the results

100
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,033
could be disastrous.

101
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,435
-Hmm.

102
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,970
-There's another thing.

103
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,671
Sai was injured on
the mission, so I've

104
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,241
been forced to remove
him from Team Kakashi,

105
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,509
if only temporarily.

106
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,644
Naturally, we'll need
someone to take his place,

107
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:41,014
so I thought I would suggest the
young novice monk who was also

108
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:45,085
involved in the mission, even
though he's a little, well--

109
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,520
-What is it?

110
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,256

113
00:06:37,863 --> 00:06:40,232
So the four grave robbers
were lying in wait

114
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,836
for the four of you, as if
they'd been expecting you.

115
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,238
-I don't think it was
Chiriku they were after.

116
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,307
Because by that point,
he wasn't even with us.

117
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,576
I had asked him to stay behind.

118
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,845
Of course, it's possible
that, like the Akatsuki,

119
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,147
they were targeting Naruto.

120
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,882
And how would they
know he'd be there?

121
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,584
There's no way they
could've been sure

122
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,885
that we and Naruto
would have been

123
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,489
dispatched to the
Temple of Fire.

124
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:08,260
-So, that leaves
only this kid, Sora.

125
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:09,361
-Exactly.

126
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,930
And if I'm right
and he is the one,

127
00:07:11,163 --> 00:07:12,731
I thought it would be
in our best interest

128
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:14,767
to have him here with
us, in the village.

129
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,236
Of course, I cleared it with
the Temple of Fire first.

130
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:24,176
-Anyway, just
listen to me, Sora.

00:07:24,176 --> 00:07:26,745

yourself with Lady Tsunade.

00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,714
[sighs]

166
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,216
-You pass.

167
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:38,751
Welcome to the Leaf Village.

168
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,619
-That hurts.

169
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:41,554
Ow!

170
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:42,321
Hey, if you don't mind--

171
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:43,189
ASUMA (TO HIMSELF): Sora.

172
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,823
You've grown up, haven't you?

173
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,159
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
I'd better be off.

174
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,861
I have to write up my report.

175
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,196
SAKURA: Come on, Sai.

176
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,697
I have to get you
to the hospital.

177
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,565
SAI: All right.

178
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,300
NARUTO: Hey, uh, what about me?

179
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,701
I-- I wanna get on
with my training.

180
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:57,603
-Give it a rest, would you?

181
00:08:57,636 --> 00:09:00,739
Anyway, Kakashi-sensei is
out of town on a mission.

182
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:01,740
You look after Sora.

183
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,676
Come on, he's our
new teammate, right?

184
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,810
Show him around the village.

185
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:06,378
Make him feel at home.

186
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:09,448
--[sighing] How come I'm
always stuck with him?

187
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:10,849
It's not safe being
around this guy.

188
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,450
-Oh.

189
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:12,685
Yeah.

190
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,653
Like I really want to hang
out with a jerk like you.

191
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,455
-Well, you boys have fun.

192
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,856
Go at it as much as you want.

193
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,924
I'm outta here.

194
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,159
Let's go, Sai.

195
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,560
SAI: Right.

196
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,562
ASUMA: So long, Naruto.

197
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,397
I'll leave Sora in your hands.

198
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,533
-[grunting] This is so not fair!

199
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:28,601
-Huh.

200
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,336
I guess they feel
the same way you do.

201
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,403
-Huh?

202
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,372
-Seems like I'm just
a burden to everybody.

203
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:34,673
-That's not it and you know it.

204
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:35,608
Come on.

205
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,909
You really think
Sakura and Captain

206
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:38,310
Yamato think you're a burden?

207
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,145
If that's the way they
felt, they certainly

208
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,449
wouldn't have brought you here
to the village, would they?

209
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:44,583
-Yeah, I know that.

210
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,418
-Then what's your problem?

211
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:49,188
[sighing] Look,
you've got to forget

212
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,522
this vengeance thing of yours.

213
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:51,457
-You don't get it!

214
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,858
This has nothing
to do with that.

215
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,226
-I know, but--

216
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,594
[wind rustling leaves]

217
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:10,309
-My father-- I always used
to look up to him as a hero.

218
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,311
He didn't fear a thing.

219
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:15,414
He was a pillar of
strength for me.

220
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:18,384
My only memories of him are
from up until I was five.

221
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,590
The people at the
Fire Temple, they

222
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,192
would never tell me about
what really happened.

223
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,296
However, there were times I
just couldn't help overhear

224
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,465
them talking about
my father's death.

225
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,568
And the tone in their voice
when they spoke of it.

226
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:37,569
[smack]

227
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:38,871
-He got what he
deserved, they'd say.

228
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,673
Killing him was the
right thing to do.

229
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,878
My father could never
have done what they say.

230
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,713
It's a mistake.

231
00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:49,581
They're wrong!

232
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:51,917
But I will make it right.

233
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,586
And after I've done
that, I will repay

234
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:57,156
whoever it was that
killed my father.

235
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,525
NARUTO (TO HIMSELF): Sora.

236
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:02,494
-Stop following me around
everywhere, will you?

237
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:03,262
It's annoying.

238
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,496
NARUTO: Annoying!

239
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,199
That's what I get for trying
to show you some sympathy.

240
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:07,866
-Ha!

241
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:10,202
Meddling's a better word for it.

242
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:11,236
I'll do just fine.

243
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,504
I don't need your help.

244
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:15,574
10 minutes and this whole
village will be mine.

245
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:16,475
-Great!

246
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:17,242
Go ahead.

247
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,310
Do whatever you want.

248
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,511
Fine with me.

249
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,647
It's not like I ever wanted
to be your babysitter.

-Wait, he said the
village will be his?

253
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:34,560
What's with that?

254
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,308
Aw, come on.

255
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,442
Where did he go?

256
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:53,545
How could I have lost him?

257
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,180
Huh?

00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,548

-Wanna fight, huh?

261
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:02,888
Fine, but don't think
I'll go easy on you

262
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:04,757
just because you're a dog.

263
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:10,796
-Now he's in a
stare-down with Akamaru?

264
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:11,397
Oh, brother.

00:12:22,261 --> 00:12:23,929
-This could be trouble.

Let's just hope Kiba
doesn't show up.

268
00:12:26,098 --> 00:12:27,900
-Hey, Naruto.

269
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:29,334
You're back, huh.

270
00:12:29,368 --> 00:12:30,636
Oh, Akamaru.

271
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:31,503
There you are.

272
00:12:31,537 --> 00:12:32,504
Where you been, boy?

273
00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:34,239
And who is that guy?

274
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,374
I've never seen him before.

275
00:12:35,374 --> 00:12:36,008
-Oh, him?

276
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:36,909
He's uh--

277
00:12:36,942 --> 00:12:37,976
-Hey.

278
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,111
Hey, you.

279
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:42,247
What're you doing messing
with Akamaru, huh?

280
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:44,416
-Does this mutt belong to you?

281
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:46,685
Why don't you keep this
mangy beast on a leash

282
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,887
and teach him not to
bark at strangers.

283
00:12:48,921 --> 00:12:50,489
-You think he's a
pet or something?

284
00:12:50,522 --> 00:12:53,358
And he's been trained to
bark at suspicious people.

285
00:12:53,392 --> 00:12:54,459
So, where are you from?

come here to take over
this stinking village.

Slow down, Kiba.

of the team, so he's a little--

-Would you stop butting in?

I'm not with him.

I'm not with anybody.

-Aah, boy.

-Let's go!

Let's have a free-for-all!

-You're all alone, you idiot.

315
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:37,603
That's no free-for-all.

It's a massacre.

317

Let's go, Choji!

You think Fatso's
gonna be much help?

I have big bones!

And the rest is all

KIBA: That's it!

00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:55,647
--[inhaling deeply]
Attention, Kohaku Clan!

501
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,683
Tonight you're all going to die.

502
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:01,386
But I promise you,
your sacrifice

503
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:06,257
will help to protect the Land
of Fire for all eternity.

504
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,060
And for that, you
have our thanks.

505
00:20:14,332 --> 00:20:14,933
Do it.

506
00:20:22,674 --> 00:20:25,577

00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,850
ASUMA (VOICEOVER):
Sora and Naruto?

509
00:22:01,883 --> 00:22:02,918
Ha!

510
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:04,653
Good luck hammering
those two into anything

511
00:22:04,686 --> 00:22:06,321
like a smoothly
functioning team.

512
00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:07,956
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER)
Well, Team Kakashi,

513
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:09,891
you'll have to proceed with
your training on your own

514
00:22:09,925 --> 00:22:10,892
for a while.

515
00:22:10,892 --> 00:22:11,960
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
So I can finally

516
00:22:11,993 --> 00:22:13,462
pick up my training
where I left off, huh?

517
00:22:13,495 --> 00:22:14,830
MALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): Uh, no.

518
00:22:14,863 --> 00:22:16,565
You'll need Kakashi for that.

519
00:22:16,598 --> 00:22:18,467
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): What am I
supposed to do in the meantime?

520
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,181
MALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): Let's see.

521
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:20,335
I know.

522
00:22:20,368 --> 00:22:22,337
We'll have Asuma-sensei
supervise your training.

523
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:22,904
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Excellent.

524
00:22:22,938 --> 00:22:24,439
ASUMA (VOICEOVER): Me?

525
00:22:24,473 --> 00:22:25,540
Why me?

526
00:22:25,574 --> 00:22:28,610
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time, "The Two Kings."

527
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,251
