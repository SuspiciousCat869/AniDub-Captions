1
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,180
-You think I'm gonna run?

2
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,000
Your, uh-- shadow jutsu.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It lasts about five
minutes, as I recall.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,200
And it's just the two of us now.

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,130
You make this one
easy for me, boy!

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,010
Ha!

7
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,000
-If you're counting
the original,

8
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,080
my body holds up to five hearts.

9
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,120
Thanks to you, though, I'm
not in need of a replacement.

10
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,170
That's why I'll be taking yours.

11
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,220
-Oh, how I've been
waiting for this.

12
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,000
-They were two separate bodies.

13
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,150
But they merged.

14
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,150
-The fire style and wind
style masks are now one.

15
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,090
-I will take your
heart, Kakashi,

16
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,090
to replace the one
you took from me.

17
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,030
-Over there.

18
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,080
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): He's
trying to force me into the open

19
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,100
where he can shoot m down.

20
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,230
-You call that hiding?

21
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,190
-Sensei!

22
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,140
[theme song]

23
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,110
-You did well this
time, Kakashi.

24
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,010
But do you have the courage
to show yourself and stand

25
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,140
before us like a man?

26
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,559
-Not again.

27
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,200
Water style, water wall!

28
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,010
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Looks like
fire enhanced with the wind

29
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,000
change in chakra nature can't be
put out with water style alone.

30
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,090
Which means I'll just have
to fight him in close range.

31
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,100
-No!

32
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,010
-Kakashi-Sensei!

33
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,040
-You took your eyes off me.

34
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,000
An unfortunate distraction.

35
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:55,130
And now your heart is mine.

36
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,000
-Now die!

37
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,220
How about that?

38
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,150
Pain can be so
addicting, can't it?

39
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,040
-I'm counting on you, Shikamaru.

40
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,200
-How worthless.

41
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,190
Jashin must be disappointed
it's already over.

42
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,160
Well, then.

43
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,150
I'm sure Kakuzu must be
wrapping things up now, too.

44
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,190
-What-- what did you do?

45
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:19,000
-It seems he pulled
it off just in time.

46
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,070
-But-- but how?

47
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,110
-Time to go.

48
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,558
Hm?

49
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,150
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Not deep enough.

50
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,200
-Damn you.

51
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,150
Why are you still alive?

52
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,100
You shouldn't be standing.

53
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,130
How?

54
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,230
-It's simple.

55
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,230
I fooled you.

56
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,150
You thought you killed me,
but you were dead wrong.

57
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,210
And all that blood
dripping off your weapon?

58
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,210
It isn't even mine.

59
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,070
That's right.

60
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,180
It's your partner's blood.

61
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,080
-It's not possible.

62
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,220
-That's where you're wrong.

63
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,050
That ritual of your partner's?

64
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,180
Sorry to tell you this.

65
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,020
He used your blood for it.

66
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,190
-So that's the plan.

67
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,070
Use this when you get a
chance, Kakashi-Sensei.

68
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,100
Please hold onto it until then.

69
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,020
-You see, Shikamaru knew Hidan's
powers utilized other people's

70
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:47,180
blood, so he prepared
blood capsules in advance

71
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,170
just in case.

72
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,100
-What are you saying?

73
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,050
-It could have been anybody.

74
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,190
If there was an
opportunity, one of us

75
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,090
had to get a sample from Kakuzu.

76
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,190
See, this capsule
came in quite handy.

77
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,050
-It can't be.

78
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,150
When could you possibly
have had the chance?

79
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,050
-When I struck you through
with my lightning blade.

80
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,020
At that exact moment I
extracted your blood.

81
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,140
-I'll get ahold of him.

82
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:46,230
You guys can stay out of it.

83
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:51,060
And the diversion--
that'll be me.

84
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,170
I've got this.

85
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,110
That's when I nabbed it.

86
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,080
My job was to trap you.

87
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,080
-Where are we going, kid, huh?

88
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,190
Splitting up me and Kakuzu
isn't gonna save you.

89
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,080
Damn you!

90
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:29,010
-Wasn't wise for
the kid to go alone.

91
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,220
He's underestimated Hidan.

92
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:35,100
He did show a lot
of promise, though.

93
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,010
He'd have commanded quite
a bounty down the line.

94
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,050
But today that boy dies.

95
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,498
-Yah!

96
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,140
-Anyway, that's how our
little strategy played out.

97
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,020
-You little rat.

98
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,070
-No way.

99
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,140
That lousy kid planned
that far ahead?

100
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,060
-That's about the size of it.

101
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,100
You should have
been more careful.

102
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,080
This time you misunderstood
your opponent.

103
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,210
Asuma gave his life leaving
behind that information.

104
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:48,010
No way he was going
to let it go to waste.

105
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,030
You people take lives
without hesitation.

106
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,170
There's no way you
could ever understand

107
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,150
the depth of what
Shikamaru feels.

108
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,190
-Kakashi-Sensei!

109
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,140
-Are you OK, sensei?

110
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,110
-Yeah.

111
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,140
Somehow I am.

112
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,040
INO (VOICEOVER): I can't believe
they invaded his body that much

113
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,120
in such a short time.

114
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,150
If Shikamaru had
taken any longer--

115
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,140
-Slowly.

116
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,060
Make sure not to
damage the vessels.

117
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,000
Here, let me treat you
with medical ninjutsu.

118
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,060
-It'll have to wait.

119
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,507
They're coming.

120
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,110
-Expansion jutsu!

121
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,599
Super slam!

122
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
-Nice work!

123
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,160
Way to go, Choji!

124
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,529
-Huh?

125
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,479
-Choji!

126
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,170
-Dammit.

127
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,050
-What?

128
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,170
He reanimated?

129
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,230
-He somehow absorbed the
lightning-style monster's

130
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,489
heart.

131
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,100
-What is he becoming?

132
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:07,020
-His primary body is
becoming a monster, too.

133
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,180
-Not one of my hearts, but two.

134
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,010
This hasn't happened
to me in a while.

135
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,170
[laughter]

136
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,070
-You know, I'm not
all that bright,

137
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,100
but even I can see through you.

138
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,100
You've used it so
many times now.

139
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,100
After seeing you do
it so much any idiot

140
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,070
could figure out the ins
and outs of your jutsu.

141
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,000
-What did you say?

142
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,040
-I can tell your jutsu isn't
as strong as it was before.

143
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,210
It hasn't even
been five minutes,

144
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,090
and I can already move again.

145
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:27,050
Thing is, I realized that both
the power and the duration

146
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,000
of your little jutsu gradually
weakens each and every time

147
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,476
you use it.

148
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,040
Admit it, kid.

149
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:46,180
The longer you use the jutsu,
the more feeble it gets.

150
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,210
Until you have nothing left.

151
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,200
I'd even venture to
guess you're approaching

152
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,130
the limit of your chakra.

153
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,130
Ain't that right?

154
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:19,150
-This time there's no escape.

155
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,150
-Get ready.

156
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,030
-Right.

157
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,020
-He's fast.

158
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,010
CHOJI (VOICEOVER): I can't move.

159
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,110
-Kakashi, I had
intended to replace

160
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,170
the hearts I lost with yours.

161
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,020
But I've changed my mind.

162
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:55,100
After all, I can find more
hearts any time I please.

163
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,100
Now die!

164
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,110
-Wind style, Rasengan!

165
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,220
-Water style, ripping torrent!

166
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,220
-Hurricane fortress jutsu!

167
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,080
-Sorry we're late.

168
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,050
But better late than never.

169
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,539
-Huh?

170
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,030
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Perfect timing.

171
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,020
[music playing]

172
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,010
-You know what those words mean?

173
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,040
If you curse someone
and take them out,

174
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,000
you'll also be defeated
in retribution.

175
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,170
You'll end up digging
your own grave.

176
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,100
My sensei's gone because of you.

177
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,100
Can't just let you
run around free.

178
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:21,230
This hole's the last
thing you'll ever see.

179
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,190
Next time-- When
You Curse Someone,

180
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,140
You Dig Your Own Grave.
