1
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:41,122
{\an1}I'm not enjoying this.

2
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:43,593
{\an1}I'm beginning to lose
patience with these shinobi.

3
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,334
{\an4}Yes, just how long do they
expect us feudal lords to
remain cooped up in such
cramped quarters as these?!

4
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,937
{\an1}Now, now.
What's the harm, really?

5
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:57,442
{\an1}In fact, we should bestow
upon them meritorious honors
once the war is over.

6
00:00:58,944 --> 00:01:03,717
{\an1}Now, let's see. What do
you suppose that we should
call such decorations?

7
00:01:15,664 --> 00:01:17,131
{\an1}Is this the place?

8
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:28,211
{\an4}<i>[Feudal Lord]</i>
<i>How hard the wind blows</i>
<i>as we travel down this</i>
<i>long and winding road.</i>

9
00:01:29,013 --> 00:01:32,951
{\an1}The scent that's on the
breeze reminds me of the
capital back in my youth.

10
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:40,158
{\an4}You know, it isn't unheard
of for feudal lords such as
myself to end up as hostages
during times of war.

11
00:01:41,192 --> 00:01:44,665
{\an1}And it remains the duty
of our shinobi to
guarantee our safety.

12
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:48,368
{\an1}Of course. This is exactly
why I'm here escorting you,

13
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:50,203
{\an1}Feudal Lord of the
Land of Frost.

14
00:01:51,906 --> 00:01:54,208
{\an1}We should be reaching
your safe house shortly.

15
00:01:58,447 --> 00:02:02,018
{\an1}Now then, what's a
suitable title for the
shinobi's decoration?

16
00:02:02,986 --> 00:02:05,789
{\an1}Certificate of...
Certificate of...

17
00:02:07,157 --> 00:02:07,858
Ohh??

18
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:14,766
{\an1}An enemy?!

19
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,801
{\an1}But I didn't sense
anything at all! Did you?

20
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:18,170
{\an1}Keep them away from
the Feudal Lords!

21
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:30,551
Mmm?

22
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:32,988
<i>[guard]</i>
<i>Gotcha!</i>

23
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:40,596
{\an1}Huh?

24
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:45,869
{\an1}So, this wasn't it, was it?

25
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,639
Damn! He got away.

26
00:02:48,973 --> 00:02:51,809
{\an1}All right, we have to get
word out to the other safe
houses immediately!

27
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,181
{\an1}Ah ha! I've just thought
of a most excellent name
for that honor!

28
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,522
{\an4}All right, listen closely
and tell me, what would you
say to the idea of calling
this new honor of ours,

29
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:04,257
{\an1}"The Land of Fire's
Hidden Leaf,

30
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,725
Land of Wind's
Hidden Sand,

31
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,427
Land of Earth's
Hidden Stone,

32
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:08,829
Land of Water's
Hidden Mist,

33
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:10,564
Land of Lightning's
Hidden Cloud

34
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:12,668
Allied Shinobi
Decoration"?

35
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,270
{\an1}Please I want all of
you to give me your
honest opinion!

36
00:03:15,303 --> 00:03:16,873
So, what do you
think of my idea?

37
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:17,874
It's too long!

38
00:03:19,341 --> 00:03:22,146
{\an1}<i>Why not just the</i>
<i>"Allied Award?!"</i>
<i>That will suffice!</i>

39
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:26,650
{\an1}<i>No, no. That's much too short!</i>
<i>And it doesn't sound</i>
<i>distinctive enough.</i>

40
00:03:28,352 --> 00:03:31,022
{\an1}The Feudal Lords seem a
bit oblivious, don't they?

41
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:34,592
What's all the fuss
over some decoration,
anyway?

42
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:37,596
{\an1}Yeah, but that's
their job.

43
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:40,366
{\an1}Besides, we need to
respect their orders.

44
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:44,871
{\an1}Their medals and decorations
help define what honor is,
and we need that right now.

45
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:48,676
{\an1}I mean, somebody's got
to set the standards,
don't you agree?

46
00:03:49,343 --> 00:03:49,811
{\an3}Well,

47
00:03:50,812 --> 00:03:52,413
{\an1}When you put it like that,
yeah, I guess so.

48
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:57,252
{\an4}Of course, you aren't going
to get any decorations by
just standing around here
thinking about it, you know!

49
00:03:57,854 --> 00:03:59,956
{\an1}So stay alert.
We're gonna be
moving soon.

50
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:06,097
{\an1}All right, Feudal Lord
of the Land of Frost.

51
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,300
{\an1}We should be arriving
at the fifth safe house
in a short while.

52
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:11,570
You really have
five of them?

53
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:12,804
We do.

54
00:04:14,673 --> 00:04:17,275
{\an4}You see, my lord,
you're going to be rotated
between the various
houses at set intervals,

55
00:04:17,309 --> 00:04:21,115
{\an1}and as a result of that,
the enemy won't be able to
pinpoint your location.

56
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:25,120
{\an1}Your bodyguards are all
seasoned warriors, as well.

57
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:29,323
{\an1}Hm. Well, that does
set my mind at ease.

58
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:30,959
Excellent.

59
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:44,142
{\an1}Hnh, Those fools.
They underestimate me!
I am Black Zetsu!

60
00:05:01,694 --> 00:05:05,332
{\an1}<i>This land is me!</i>
<i>I am one with it!</i>

61
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,627
"Battleground"

62
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,592
It's dull.

63
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:27,498
{\an1}But I guess I'll have to show
them why I'm the one that's been
assigned to guard the coastline.

64
00:07:31,704 --> 00:07:34,774
{\an1}I'll launch the opening
shot now, then move in.

65
00:07:37,777 --> 00:07:38,913
Lightning Style.

66
00:07:39,313 --> 00:07:40,314
Black Panther!

67
00:07:45,787 --> 00:07:48,623
Yaaaggghh!

68
00:07:48,924 --> 00:07:50,827
Whoa!
Black Lightning!

69
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,265
{\an4}Yeah! Captain Darui is the
only person that the
previous Raikage has allowed
to get a lightning tattoo!

70
00:07:55,631 --> 00:07:57,001
{\an1}I'm sorry about all that.

71
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:02,474
Hyaaaghh!

72
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:06,077
Above us!

73
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:10,616
I'm not gonna
let you get by!

74
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:17,557
Keep attacking!
Don't let up!

75
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:33,443
Hold 'em! Don't let
them break through the
barricade! Let's go!

76
00:08:33,676 --> 00:08:36,546
[battle shouts]

77
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:39,717
{\an1}My worst nightmare
has come true.

78
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:41,018
{\an1}It's almost like--

79
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:45,157
{\an1}No, this really IS
a Great Ninja War.

80
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:52,499
{\an1}It's Choza.

81
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,134
{\an1}Is it really?

82
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,006
{\an1}Yes, I see.

83
00:08:59,474 --> 00:09:01,443
{\an1}You're all grown up, Choza.

84
00:09:02,444 --> 00:09:05,915
{\an1}That's right! And guess what?
I'm about to grow even bigger!

85
00:09:06,782 --> 00:09:07,483
Now! Release!

86
00:09:09,685 --> 00:09:12,089
{\an1}Eight Trigrams Palm Rotation.

00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:32,846
{\an1}Forgive me.

90
00:09:34,515 --> 00:09:37,918
{\an1}As a member of the branch
family, I should protect the
main family, yet I'm your enemy.

91
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,524
{\an1}I suppose this is my
punishment for resenting
the main branch.

92
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:45,660
{\an1}My body won't do what
I want it to do now.

93
00:09:48,164 --> 00:09:54,071
{\an4}In the end, it appears that
even my decision to sacrifice
myself for the sake of the
Village has been negated.

00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:58,443
{\an1}<i>[Hizashi] [flashback]</i>

<i>Neji a message for me.</i>

95
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,814
{\an1}Tell him that I did not make
this sacrifice to merely
protect the head family.

96
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:05,484
But for my siblings,
family, and village.

97
00:10:06,018 --> 00:10:11,024
{\an1}So by my own free will, I
chose death! And in doing
so, I chose my own freedom!

98
00:10:14,595 --> 00:10:18,332
{\an1}This is just the fate in
store for me as a member
of the branch family.

99
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:25,207
{\an1}But no such fate exists! Your
very own son has been fighting
hard to demonstrate just that!

100

00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:42,562
Haaa!

105
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,238
Are you doing all
right, Neji?!

106
00:10:51,704 --> 00:10:53,941
{\an1}Yes. Thank you, Hinata.

107
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,781
{\an1}The branch family doesn't
live to protect and serve
the main family anymore.

108
00:11:00,114 --> 00:11:02,084
{\an1}We protect each
other as equals now!

109
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:07,190
{\an1}So after all this time,
it's actually come to pass?

110
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,528
{\an1}Then hear me, Brother.

111
00:11:11,027 --> 00:11:14,365
That is all the more
reason that I wish to
fall by your hand!

Yah!

113
00:11:34,288 --> 00:11:37,692
{\an1}Even the wild geese know the
importance of formation.

114
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:40,362
{\an1}When the leader of any
group becomes confused,

115
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:43,666
{\an1}then the entire flock
that's following him
will be put at risk.

116
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:50,841
{\an1}I'm too young and
inexperienced to do that.

117
00:11:50,874 --> 00:11:54,178
So I ask you,
All of you.

118
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:56,649
{\an1}Please, lend me your
strength for this fight!

To victory!

121
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:18,840
{\an1}Although I admit that it's
also an undeniable fact

122
00:12:18,874 --> 00:12:22,077
{\an1}that someone young
and charismatic must
stand at the helm.

123
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:40,433
{\an1}Ngh! Hey! Watch it!
All this moving around
is making me feel sick!

124
00:12:40,865 --> 00:12:43,202
{\an1}All of you are
completely artless!
Hmph!

125
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:48,175
{\an5}Just be quiet.
Keep it up and I'll be
happy to seal that
mouth shut too.

126
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:50,511
{\an1}I'm not into S&M, thanks!

127
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:54,015
{\an1}Let me out of here and I'll show
you what real art is! Hmph!

128
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:57,219
{\an1}So annoying.

That was very
nicely done.

135
00:13:19,111 --> 00:13:21,748
{\an1}It appears that you've
managed to outdo Sasori.

136
00:13:22,382 --> 00:13:25,184
{\an1}Huh? I know that voice.

137
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:30,891
{\an1}Hey! If you're reinforcements
here to help me, then get me
out of here! It's stuffy!

so that you can't explode,

141
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:45,475
Hm? Oh, yeah.
I guess you're
right about that.

142

00:13:50,281 --> 00:13:55,254
{\an4}I consider both the
Akatsuki and the shinobi
of the Five Great Nations
to be my enemies.

144
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:58,290
{\an1}I don't really care to
help either of you.

145
00:13:58,957 --> 00:14:04,431
{\an1}But with this disgusting
jutsu controlling me,
my body moves against its will.

146
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,269
{\an7}<i>The Reanimation Jutsu again.</i>

147
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:12,741
{\an7}<i>As if Granny Chiyo weren't</i>
<i>dangerous enough, these guys</i>
<i>look pretty scary, too.</i>

148
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:18,781
{\an7}<i>It sure doesn't help that we</i>
<i>split up our fighting force.</i>

149
00:14:23,787 --> 00:14:27,224
Listen up.
We retreat on my
signal, you got it?

150
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:28,058
{\an1}Roger that.

151
00:14:47,448 --> 00:14:49,517
New tactical
orders in from HQ.

152
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,653
And we're to transmit
them to the front!

153
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,723
Get the plans to
the captains!

154
00:14:55,557 --> 00:14:57,259
Yaaaggh!

155
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:03,433
Captain Kitsuchi!
We've just had word
come in from HQ!

156
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:04,835
We have new
tactical orders!

157
00:15:05,402 --> 00:15:07,204
{\an1}Tell me! And be quick about it!

158
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:15,013
{\an1}<i>[Shikamaru]</i>
<i>All right. Got it.</i>

159
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:18,851
Sorry for the
interruption.

160
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:22,656
{\an1}I've just gotten orders to take
half this company and join up
with the First Company.

161
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:26,426
{\an1}What?! Half of our forces?!
Is HQ out of their minds?!

162
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:30,164
{\an1}They're not, I agree
with their strategy.
It's a sound one.

163
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:35,237
{\an1}If everything goes according
to plan, it'll be okay.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

164
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:38,207
{\an1}But one thing troubles me.

165
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:41,411
Why? What's the
matter, Shikamaru?

166
00:15:43,446 --> 00:15:48,386
{\an4}Supposedly, the enemy has
a shinobi who possesses
the Kekkei Touta, which
surpasses Kekkei Genkai.

167
00:15:48,954 --> 00:15:51,657
{\an1}What?! The Kekkei Touta?!
Are you sure about that?

168
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:55,695
Kekkei Touta?
What are they
talking about?

169
00:15:56,361 --> 00:15:57,764
Do you know,
Matsuri?

170
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:00,768
No, I've never
heard of it before.

171
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:03,971
Although, from
Temari's reaction,
it's something big.

172
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,340
Whoever it is must be
a formidable enemy.

173
00:16:07,576 --> 00:16:08,375
You there.

174
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,415
{\an4}How do you expect to
defend yourself against
the Kekkei Touta if you
know nothing about it?!

175
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:16,285
[both]
I'm sorry.
Forgive me, Temari!

176
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:22,125
{\an1}But, um, now can you
tell us what exactly
the Kekkei Touta i?

177
00:16:22,526 --> 00:16:26,331
{\an5}Give me a break.
You young ones really
don't know anything
at all, do you?!

178
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:28,901
{\an1}The Kekkei Touta is...

179
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:31,070
Yes? The Kekkei...?

180
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:33,706
{\an1}Touta... is what?

181
00:16:35,574 --> 00:16:38,044
Shikamaru! Go on,
explain this to them!

182
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:39,713
{\an1}What?! Why me?

183
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:44,552
{\an1}You know why! I'm not good
at these kinds of things!
Just explain it already!

184
00:16:45,386 --> 00:16:50,726
{\an4}Ah, damn it. You know,
I'm the one who's supposed
to be giving the orders
around here, remember?!

185
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:53,562
{\an1}Hey, hold up. I want to
hear this too, Shikamaru.

186
00:16:53,997 --> 00:16:59,402
{\an4}[[sigh] Well, then, I
guess I should start
with the basics, the
properties of chakra.

187
00:17:00,804 --> 00:17:03,440
{\an1}<i>Generally, we all possess</i>
<i>one chakra nature.</i>

188
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:06,945
{\an1}<i>Besides the nature you obtain</i>
<i>from training, that is.</i>

189
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:14,920
{\an4}<i>There are different natures.</i>
<i>This is kind of simplistic,</i>
<i>but the more chakra natures</i>
<i>you have, the better.</i>

190
00:17:16,322 --> 00:17:20,060
{\an1}<i>That's why most jonin</i>
<i>worth their salt possess</i>
<i>multiple chakra natures.</i>

191
00:17:21,328 --> 00:17:22,664
{\an1}Oh, I get it!

192
00:17:22,964 --> 00:17:25,299
Yeah, but I
already knew that
much about it.

193
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,601
You'd better
know that!

194
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:28,536
However.

195
00:17:29,972 --> 00:17:32,841
{\an1}Some shinobi are different:
they're born with two
chakra natures.

196
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:38,049
{\an4}<i>They're able to fuse</i>
<i>those two chakras.</i>
<i>And, by doing so,</i>
<i>create new chakra.</i>

197
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:42,218
{\an1}<i>They are known as</i>
<i>Kekkei Genkai shinobi.</i>

198
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,093
{\an4}Captain Yamato's Wood
Style is a combination of
water and earth chakra.
Isn't that right?

199
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:49,561
<i>Yeah, it is.</i>

200
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:54,634
{\an1}And another example is
Captain Darui, who's now
leading the First Company.

201
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:58,038
His Gale Style's a
combination of lightning
and water chakra.

202
00:17:58,438 --> 00:17:59,205
Got it?

203
00:18:00,574 --> 00:18:03,544
{\an1}Those guys are all
shinobi who possess
very rare jutsu styles.

204
00:18:04,646 --> 00:18:07,248
{\an1}Yeah, that's right.
But even stronger than
the Kekkai Genkai,

205
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:12,788
{\an4}is what we call the
Kekkei Touta, in which
three chakra natures
are fused together.

206
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:14,690
[both]
What?!
Three of them?

207
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:18,061
{\an1}It's almost beyond belief,
and it's very rare.

208
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:23,201
{\an1}So rare, in fact, that of
all the shinobi in all the
nations, I only know one.

209
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:26,337
{\an1}But the enemy has the
Reanimation Jutsu.

210
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,776
And they've brought
back a long-dead
Kekkei Touta shinobi.

211
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,714
He uses Particle Style.
He's Mu the Second
Tsuchikage.

212
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:42,423
[sigh] We'd better come
up with a strategy to
use against him.

213
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:45,426
{\an1}Shikamaru, I don't get it.

214
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:50,332
{\an4}Why would we split up our
forces when we're just about
to face an enemy shinobi as
formidable as that?

215
00:18:50,867 --> 00:18:55,471
{\an4}Yeah, I know. But it
appears that Headquarters
has taken that issue into
consideration, too.

216
00:18:56,707 --> 00:18:58,142
{\an1}We've been graced
by the presence,

217
00:18:58,842 --> 00:19:01,713
{\an1}<i>of a rare ally who</i>
<i>possesses Kekkei Touta.</i>

218
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,221
{\an1}You didn't need to
get up, you know.
We can handle this.

219
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:13,627
{\an1}Hmf. You're the one who
lit the fire beneath me.

220
00:19:14,494 --> 00:19:16,963
{\an1}Then let me ask you this.

221
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,271
{\an1}When did all of you
forsake yourselves?

222
00:19:22,603 --> 00:19:23,371
What?!

223
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,254
{\an1}I'm going to retrieve here what
I had previously forsaken!

224
00:19:38,189 --> 00:19:52,139
{\an1}<i>[shouts of battle,</i>
<i>clashing metal,</i>
<i>explosions]</i>

225
00:19:52,172 --> 00:19:53,573
Haaaa!

226
00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:01,716
{\an1}Super-Expansion Jutsu!

227
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,655
Raaghh!

228
00:20:16,267 --> 00:20:17,367
Haaaa!

229
00:20:28,915 --> 00:20:30,116
It's pitiful.

230
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:35,521
{\an1}The jutsu of the Second Hokage
has snared us both, when we'd
already defeated him before.

231
00:20:36,156 --> 00:20:37,758
You know what I
mean, Kinkaku?

232
00:20:39,194 --> 00:20:42,197
I'm sorry to cause
you shame, Lords
Kinkaku and Ginkaku.

233
00:20:42,464 --> 00:20:46,401
{\an1}It's also hard for me to
dishonor the "two rays of
light among the clouds."

234
00:20:48,104 --> 00:20:51,375
{\an1}Ginkaku. Take a look
at his left shoulder.

235
00:20:54,978 --> 00:20:57,815
{\an1}This kid's wearing the Third
Raikage's Lightning Mark.

236
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,718
{\an1}It seems he's
got some skill.

237
00:21:01,686 --> 00:21:06,158
{\an4}I'm sorry for the
disrespect, but I'm going
to have to shame both of
you a little right now.

238
00:21:07,593 --> 00:21:12,098
{\an4}I'm afraid that I might
even end up stripping
away the shine from
your gold and silver,

239
00:21:16,938 --> 00:21:19,473
{\an1}With just a single strike
of my Gale Style!

240
00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:21,609
Though it'll be dull.

241
00:22:57,389 --> 00:23:01,193
{\an4}<i>[Ginkaku]</i>
<i>I have to say, I really</i>

243
00:23:03,062 --> 00:23:05,465

{\an1}<i>[Ginkaku]</i>
