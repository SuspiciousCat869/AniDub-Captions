00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:54,457
{\an1}"Hopes Entrusted to the Future"

2
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,588
{\an1}He's not on the northern route.

3
00:01:58,455 --> 00:02:00,353
{\an1}Or the southern or the western!

4
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:02,851
{\an1}[groan] Where could Lord Gaara
have gone?

5
00:02:04,683 --> 00:02:07,414
{\an1}The massive sandstorm seems to
have passed.

6
00:02:07,448 --> 00:02:08,314
Lord Gaara?!

7
00:02:09,447 --> 00:02:10,946
{\an1}What's the commotion about?

8
00:02:11,678 --> 00:02:14,309
{\an1}Please, try to focus and resume
the Second Exam.

9
00:02:15,043 --> 00:02:15,675
Uh, yes, sir!

10
00:02:16,675 --> 00:02:18,573
{\an1}Go on! Restart the Second Exam!

11
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:35,995
{\an1}<i>It's unusual for Houichi not to</i>
<i>send a message. Could he have</i>
<i>failed?</i>

12
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,726
Hmm?

13
00:02:51,717 --> 00:02:52,083
Lord Gaara!

14
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:57,746
Fugi...

15
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,944
{\an1}<i>I've been wanting to speak with</i>
<i>you.</i>

16
00:03:04,741 --> 00:03:05,208
Well, then...

17
00:03:06,506 --> 00:03:08,072
{\an1}What did you want to talk about?

18
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:14,433
{\an1}I have always considered you to
be a highly-regarded citizen of
the Hidden Sand Village.

19
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:17,298
{\an1}I still do, even now.

20
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,430
{\an1}<i>Thank you for your kind words.</i>

21
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:27,925
{\an4}<i>In the past, words like</i>
<i>"citizen" and "friend" were just</i>
<i>that, mere words that held no</i>
<i>real meaning for me.</i>

22
00:03:28,924 --> 00:03:35,418
{\an4}<i>For a long time after I was</i>
<i>born, I understood those words,</i>
<i>but they were not part of my</i>
<i>existence.</i>

23
00:03:36,218 --> 00:03:40,215
{\an1}<i>I see...And when did these</i>
<i>concepts become real to you?</i>

24
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:48,177
{\an4}<i>When I infiltrated the Hidden</i>
<i>Leaf to destroy it. There, for</i>
<i>the first time, I met someone I</i>
<i>could call a friend.</i>

25
00:03:48,843 --> 00:03:53,074
{\an1}Ironically, he was an enemy who
belonged to the Hidden Leaf
Village.

26
00:03:58,836 --> 00:04:05,330
{\an4}Although the two of us shared
comparable circumstances,
unlike me, he was always able to
empathize with others.

27
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:12,126
{\an4}...He could share in others'
pain. He could sympathize with
their happiness and with their
tears.

28
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:17,789
{\an4}Through him I realized how
precious and important the
concept of "friend" really could
be.

29
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:24,750
{\an1}And, it made me want to become
more like him: a human being who
is valued and needed by others.

30
00:04:27,215 --> 00:04:34,111
{\an4}Lord Gaara, there's little doubt
that you will always will be an
individual who is indispensable
to the Hidden Sand Village.

31
00:04:35,077 --> 00:04:39,074
{\an1}All this time, I've been
considered a military weapon to
be feared.

32
00:04:40,073 --> 00:04:44,970
{\an4}And that fact continues to
instill fear even in the hearts
of the people of the Sand
Village.

33
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,168
But that's not-!

34
00:04:46,835 --> 00:04:47,968
Yes, it's true.

35
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:54,063
{\an1}If it were not so, then my own
father would not have tried to
kill me six times.

36
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:58,559
{\an1}I'm aware that many oppose me.

37
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,324
{\an1}When I was asked to be Kazekage,
it was a hard choice.

38
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:06,055
{\an1}To accept or not...? It was a
real dilemma.

39
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,883
{\an4}But I thought of my friend, the
Leaf shinobi who had taught me
about frienship, and I
decided...

40
00:05:14,082 --> 00:05:17,413
{\an1}<i>...I wanted to try to heal the</i>
<i>hurt I'd caused everyone.</i>

41
00:05:18,245 --> 00:05:23,076
{\an1}<i>But, it's been difficult to get</i>
<i>the people of the Sand to truly</i>
<i>believe me.</i>

42
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:29,404
{\an1}<i>There was a time when I felt</i>
<i>that the wounds I'd inflicted on</i>
<i>my people would never heal.</i>

43
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:36,199
{\an4}<i>I thought I should just</i>
<i>disappear from the Sand because</i>
<i>then the fear would finally</i>
<i>disappear, too.</i>

44
00:05:38,398 --> 00:05:45,159
{\an4}But, I found that despite my
past, there were some who,
without prejudice, accepted my
feelings and believed in me.

45
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:54,021
{\an1}This happened because you're
frightened of yourself.

46
00:05:54,686 --> 00:05:59,017
{\an1}<i>When using a weapon, you must</i>
<i>suppress your feelings and</i>
<i>become emotionless.</i>

47
00:05:59,617 --> 00:06:00,515
[exhale] Right!

48
00:06:02,847 --> 00:06:08,177
{\an1}I've met someone like you. He's
a shinobi that comes from the
Village Hidden in the Leaves.

49
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:13,406
{\an1}Through sheer perseverance, he
has become a fine shinobi.

50
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:19,302
{\an1}And Shira,...I think you will be
as impressive a shinobi as he
is.

51
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:26,598
{\an1}These shinobi who trust me have
come to accept and rely on the
guidance I provide them.

52
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,128
{\an1}They're maturing steadily.

53
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,425
{\an1}<i>We're almost there!</i>

54
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,423
{\an1}But we still need to find one
more scroll!

55
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:39,988
{\an1}Well, a whole lot did
happen...

56
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:44,117
{\an1}Why don't we just forget about
passing the Chunin Exams until
next time.

57
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:49,847
{\an4}Well, then,...even if we're not
gonna worry about getting the
other scroll that we need to
finish this...

58
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,845
{\an1}...just once, there's still
someone I wanna fight.

59
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:54,210
[gasping]

60
00:06:56,108 --> 00:06:59,340
{\an4}It's someone just like me, who
received guidance from Lord
Gaara and developed into a
shinobi.

61
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:05,069
{\an4}There's something I wanna
confirm by fighting someone who
received the same training as
me...

62
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,964
{\an1}We did it! We made it!

63
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,360
{\an1}We may have reached the tower,
but we still only have the
"Heaven" scroll...

64
00:07:18,227 --> 00:07:21,624
{\an1}There's nothing we can do. We've
simply reached our physical
limits!

65
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:24,556
{\an1}If I hadn't stopped on the way
for a personal fight...

66
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:26,054
{\an1}Don't say that, Shira!

67
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:28,086
{\an1}That's right. We've done all we
can for now.

68
00:07:28,686 --> 00:07:30,351
{\an1}<i>I'm sure we'll get another try</i>
<i>at it.</i>

69
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:31,817
Thanks a lot!

70
00:07:33,182 --> 00:07:33,816
Huh?

71
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:42,011
{\an1}[gasp] What do you want?

72
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:44,909
{\an1}Shira, I wanna face you in
battle.

73
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,339
{\an1}You can have this "Heaven"
scroll if I lose.

74
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:54,501
{\an1}<i>It's senseless for Sand to fight</i>
<i>Sand.</i>

75
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,000
{\an1}Besides, we've already made a
decision.

76
00:07:58,398 --> 00:07:59,131
Huh?!

77
00:07:59,764 --> 00:08:01,263
{\an1}This scroll is useless to us!

78
00:08:01,997 --> 00:08:02,395
Take it!

79
00:08:03,462 --> 00:08:06,392
{\an1}What?! Oh, wow! You're a real
lifesaver! Thanks!

80
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:08,458
Uhh...Huh?

81
00:08:13,288 --> 00:08:15,653
{\an1}To tell you the truth, we don't
even want the scroll.

82
00:08:16,118 --> 00:08:18,618
{\an1}I just wanna use this as an
opportunity to fight you.

83
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:19,850
Fight me?

84
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:21,115
<i>You and I...</i>

85
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:24,313
{\an1}...learned almost all we know by
studying under Lord Gaara.

86
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:28,843
{\an1}<i>We are the ones who are going to</i>
<i>carry out Lord Gaara's will.</i>

87
00:08:28,877 --> 00:08:32,641
{\an1}<i>We are the ones who are going</i>
<i>to support the Hidden Sand</i>
<i>Village in the future.</i>

88
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:35,305
{\an1}I wanna make sure we truly
deserve that right.

89
00:08:37,203 --> 00:08:37,804
All right.

90
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:40,735
Let's do it.

91
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:41,701
Okay?

92
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:43,566
{\an1}If this is what you want,
Shira...

93
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:45,065
Uh...yeah.

94
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,062
{\an1}Thank you, Shira, really.

95
00:08:50,428 --> 00:08:51,927
{\an1}So who are your supporters?

96
00:08:52,393 --> 00:08:55,557
{\an1}The promising power of the
young, the future of the Sand.

97
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:01,220
{\an1}<i>I believe in them. They have no</i>
<i>preconceptions and can see with</i>
<i>clear vision.   </i>

98
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:06,050
{\an1}<i>Those who wish to kill me may do</i>
<i>so...</i>

99
00:09:07,382 --> 00:09:10,947
{\an1}However, they shouldn't let
those youths become involved in
it.

100
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,878
{\an1}<i>I don't want them tainted by</i>
<i>hatred and vengeance.</i>

101
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,442
Now! Go!

102
00:09:17,908 --> 00:09:18,141
Right!

103
00:09:19,373 --> 00:09:20,073
[grunt]

104
00:09:34,163 --> 00:09:38,494
{\an1}<i>There have been many times where</i>
<i>I doubted myself as the</i>
<i>Kazekage.  </i>

105
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:47,986
{\an4}<i>But after meeting them and</i>
<i>coming to know them, I realized</i>
<i>that perhaps even someone like</i>
<i>me can accomplish something.</i>

106
00:09:49,252 --> 00:09:56,047
{\an4}I've been reborn. I want to
erase hatred from the Hidden
Sand and create bonds with
people I can call friends who

107
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,813
{\an1}understand and share each
other's pain.

108
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,508
{\an1}If you object to that, then you
can take my head.

109
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:07,473
{\an1}<i>But leave them out of it.</i>

110
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:26,958
[gasp]

111
00:10:39,617 --> 00:10:40,216
<i>Come on. </i>

112
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:41,883
Huh?

113
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,044
[chuckle]

114
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:56,538
{\an1}Thank you very much, Shira.

115
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,536
[grunting]

116
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:01,402
Take this.

117
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:04,366
[gasping]

118
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:07,030
Huh?

119
00:11:08,697 --> 00:11:11,228
{\an1}Well, that's not gonna work!
[laughing]

120
00:11:11,261 --> 00:11:16,190
{\an1}Seriously?! Oh, come
on, I can't believe this!
[laughing]

121
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:27,483
{\an4}<i>Lord Gaara has indeed matured. </i>
<i>It seems the worries that we old</i>

<i>after all...</i>

122

{\an1}<i>We must let the horrible</i>

00:12:05,556 --> 00:12:13,350
{\an1}...That's crazy, right...I hear
that...

00:12:13,383 --> 00:12:14,416
[loud exhale]

127
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:17,281
{\an1}Please, sir, I beg you to accept
these scrolls!

128
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,279
{\an1}I'm sorry, two "Heaven" scrolls
are not acceptable!

129
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:22,510
[yell] But we-!

130
00:12:22,777 --> 00:12:24,309
{\an1}No! Absolutely not!

131
00:12:26,307 --> 00:12:29,539
{\an4}I cannot reveal the details, but
extraordinary circumstances
stopped us from getting both
scrolls.

132
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:32,303
{\an1}Please, just go ask Lord
Kazekage!

133
00:12:32,903 --> 00:12:35,134
{\an1}Circumstances don't matter! No
means no!

134
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:36,400
Meanie!

135
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:37,533
Now, now...

136
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:38,466
Give it up.

137
00:12:39,332 --> 00:12:42,563
{\an1}No! Never! I cannot just give
up!

138
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,758
{\an1}You wanna cancel the Third
Exam?!

139
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:50,023
I'm sorry.

140
00:12:51,723 --> 00:12:55,120
{\an1}I'm afraid I can't give details,
but it's because of a domestic
matter within the Sand.

141
00:12:55,354 --> 00:12:56,985
{\an1}So how do we know who passed,
then?

142
00:12:58,984 --> 00:13:02,581
{\an4}We know because we've prepared
deatailed reports about every
team's performance in the Second
Exam.

143
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:08,411
{\an1}I'd like the respective villages
to use them to determine who
should pass.

144
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:16,638
{\an4}But this isn't just about making
a choice; these exams were to
test their ability to carry out
missions as Chunin!

145
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:19,103
{\an1}It can't be helped that things
turned out like this...

146
00:13:20,102 --> 00:13:25,098
{\an4}But will this satisfy the
participants who put their lives
on the line to survive the Demon
Desert?

147
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:27,231
{\an1}I'll address that.

148
00:13:31,495 --> 00:13:33,493
{\an1}Looks like the Third Exam's
going to be cancelled.

149
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,091
{\an1}What?! So what about the Chunin
Exams?

150
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,389
{\an1}I did have a bad feeling about
this whole thing...

151
00:13:39,422 --> 00:13:43,086
{\an1}[scoff] So does that mean all
the effort we put into this was
for nothing at all?!

152
00:13:43,785 --> 00:13:47,750
{\an1}We continued to the end and
didn't give up, so we should be
okay.

153
00:13:47,782 --> 00:13:50,447
{\an1}But those who dropped out
midway are the ones who shouldbe
worried.

154
00:13:51,314 --> 00:13:52,812
{\an1}I kinda feel bad for them...

155
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:56,976
{\an1}It seems like all that we really
got out of this was hunger and
exhaustion.

156
00:13:57,476 --> 00:13:59,341
{\an1}Yeah, it was all pain and no
gain!

157
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:02,072
{\an1}Well, at least we gained some
confidence.

158
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:05,271
What? Huh? What?

159
00:14:09,034 --> 00:14:11,832
{\an1}Exam entrants! I commend you!

160
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:20,093
{\an4}Just as times change, this
shinobi world of ours needs to
develop a new system with new
laws.

161
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:27,555
{\an4}<i>Before, shinobi were required to</i>
<i>sacrifice even the lives of our</i>
<i>comrades for our laws and our</i>
<i>rules.</i>

162
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:33,517
{\an1}But I have come to realize
there's something far more
precious than rules and laws.

163
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:41,645
{\an1}I'm speaking of friendship with
other villagers and shinobi.

164
00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:45,208
{\an1}And the bond with those who
understand the same pain.

165
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:52,403
{\an1}<i>I believe that every one of you</i>
<i>who stands before me, now, knows</i>
<i>exactly what I'm talking about.</i>

166
00:14:53,536 --> 00:14:56,667
{\an1}Therefore, I deem the Third Exam
unnecessary.

167
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,797
{\an1}And, I'm rescinding part of the
Second Exam's requirements.

168
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:02,829
{\an1}So what does that mean for us?

169
00:15:05,194 --> 00:15:10,591
{\an4}The villages of every one of
you, who is standing here right
now, will receive a report of
how you did in the Second Exam.

170
00:15:11,623 --> 00:15:16,719
{\an1}And then your Kage will make the
final decision on whether to
promote you or not.

171
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:19,384
{\an1}[growl] We have to wait longer
to find out?!

172
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,847
{\an1}Yes, but it also means that we
still have a chance to become
Chunin, correct?!

173
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:42,501
{\an1}Listen, when you reach the
northern border, you be careful.
Thanks, I will.

174
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,997
{\an1}Yome, since you're going, too,
you be nice to him!

175
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:49,762
What?!

176
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:53,627
{\an1}We just got assigned to the same
place by chance, that's all!

177
00:15:53,859 --> 00:15:55,625
{\an1}Yeah, sure, of course you did!

178
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:58,456
Go get 'im!

179
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,754
Wha-?!

180
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,053
<i>Yome, let's go!</i>

181
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:04,918
Oh...

182
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:07,384
{\an1}Hey, wait up, Shira!

183
00:16:08,516 --> 00:16:10,015
{\an1}I hope they're gonna be okay...

184
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:35,197
{\an4}We've gone through the report
from the Hidden Sand on the
Second Exam. And your protion to
Chunin has been approved.

185
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:37,495
{\an1}Thank you, Lady Angel.

186
00:16:39,094 --> 00:16:42,192
{\an1}<i>And also,...I'm going to assign</i>
<i>you an S-rank mission right</i>
<i>away.</i>

187
00:16:51,352 --> 00:16:53,017
{\an1}<i>The corpse today is light.</i>

188
00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:58,181
{\an1}<i>I've developed a knack for this</i>
<i>over the years. I can tell this</i>
<i>one's probably a woman. </i>

189
00:16:59,013 --> 00:17:03,511
{\an1}<i>The tallest tower in this whole</i>
<i>village...You know, where we</i>
<i>always deliver the bodies...</i>

190
00:17:03,976 --> 00:17:05,308
{\an1}<i>You know what it's for?</i>

191
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,972
{\an1}<i>In a village like ours, towers</i>
<i>are usually where the ashes are</i>
<i>enshrined. </i>

192
00:17:10,305 --> 00:17:13,303
{\an1}<i>They were originally built as</i>
<i>memorials to honor the fallen.</i>

193
00:17:14,136 --> 00:17:17,467
{\an1}<i>If that's the case, then why</i>
<i>aren't their relatives allowed</i>
<i>in there anymore? </i>

194
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:19,133
{\an1}<i>How should I know?</i>

195
00:17:20,964 --> 00:17:22,796
{\an1}<i>But actually, there is a rumor</i>
<i>going around about that tower,</i>
<i>you know...</i>

196
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,961
{\an1}<i>that Lord Pain lives there.</i>

197
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,960
{\an1}<i>Really? Interesting...</i>

198
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:29,091
{\an1}<i>But there's no way.</i>

199
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,457
{\an1}<i>Well, it is just a rumor,</i>
<i>nothing more.</i>

200
00:17:31,922 --> 00:17:32,755
<i>Never mind.</i>

201
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:35,287
{\an1}<i>I'm gonna confirm my theory...</i>

202
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:41,915
{\an1}<i>You were right! It's just like</i>
<i>you said...A woman.</i>

203
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,914
{\an1}<i>Ajisai, a chunin.</i>

204
00:17:44,746 --> 00:17:46,912
{\an1}<i>She just recently passed the</i>
<i>exams.</i>

205
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:50,876
{\an1}<i>Her first mission as a Chunin,</i>
<i>and this is how it ended?</i>

206
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:51,741
<i>Thank you.</i>

207
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:54,274
Oh! Lady Angel!

208
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,904
{\an1}Now quickly...Go and bring the
next one in here.

209
00:18:01,868 --> 00:18:02,502
Yourou!

210
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,567
{\an1}I know. We're being followed.

211
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:08,331
{\an1}Fuu, let's stop at that rocky
area.

212
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:09,230
Huh?

213
00:18:09,895 --> 00:18:11,029
{\an1}Aww, if you say so.

214
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:18,423
{\an1}We might not know who you are!
But you can bet we're on to you!

215
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:27,250
{\an1}I told him to stop! I mean,
after all,...if we didn't get to
kill you, it'd be a real pain!

216
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,516
[gasp]

217
00:18:29,714 --> 00:18:32,779
{\an1}Wait! Say, mister! Aren't you
from the Hidden Waterfall?

218
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:34,512
Huh?

219
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:35,445
What's that?

220
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:41,673
{\an4}<i>Yeah! I know you! After you</i>
<i>failed to assassinate the</i>
<i>Hokage, you stole the hearts of</i>
<i>the village elders and escaped! </i>

221
00:18:41,907 --> 00:18:43,440
{\an1}You're Kakuzu Senpai!

222
00:18:43,805 --> 00:18:44,439
Kakuzu?!

223
00:18:45,071 --> 00:18:46,936
{\an1}Impossible! He'd be too old!

224
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:51,833
{\an1}<i>You know,...I've always thought</i>
<i>if I ever got to meet you, I'd</i>
<i>like to be your friend!</i>

225
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:55,130
{\an1}Kakuzu...Is she stupid?

226
00:18:55,164 --> 00:18:59,327
{\an1}I wouldn't know. I deserted the
village long ago.

227
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,658
{\an1}How about we start out with some
tea and get to know each other?!

228
00:19:05,955 --> 00:19:09,787
{\an1}I didn't come here today to
become your friend, you fool...

229
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,317
{\an1}Well, that really is too bad...

230
00:19:20,712 --> 00:19:24,575
{\an1}I've thoroughly gone over the
Second Exam reports that we
received from the Sand.

231
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:33,770
{\an4}<i>And:...Hinata, Shino, Kiba,</i>
<i>Choji, Ino, and Sakura...You six</i>
<i>passed with flying colors and</i>
<i>are promoted to chunin!</i>

232
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:35,534
[cheering]

233
00:19:36,268 --> 00:19:39,599
{\an1}<i>Well,...after all, we were not</i>
<i>able to get the second scroll...</i>

234
00:19:40,564 --> 00:19:42,696
{\an1}Komugi, Gennai, Inaho...

235
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:46,693
{\an1}<i>You will have another chance in</i>
<i>the next Chunin Exams.</i>

236
00:19:46,726 --> 00:19:48,426
[whining gasps}

237
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:52,922
{\an1}Finally,...even though they
weren't able to collect both of
the scrolls,...

238
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:57,552
{\an1}<i>...they performed admirably, and</i>
<i>they are more than qualified for</i>
<i>promotion. </i>

00:19:58,352 --> 00:20:00,850
{\an1}<i>Lee and Tenten, you are now</i>
<i>chunin.</i>

240
00:20:01,716 --> 00:20:03,614
[giggling sigh]

241
00:20:04,848 --> 00:20:05,613
Lady Tsunade!

242
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:10,044
{\an1}Team Guy is one for all, all for
one! So, how can Neji be left
out?!

243
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:10,876
<i>Let me finish!</i>

244
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:11,310
[scream]

245
00:20:12,742 --> 00:20:15,606
{\an1}Neji Hyuga is given a special
double promotion and will become
a jonin!

246
00:20:16,473 --> 00:20:22,102
{\an4}The Kazekage himself said that,
"Neji's performance was most
impressive and that is reflected
in this report."

247
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:26,999
{\an1}<i>He's already proven himself more</i>
<i>than capable of being a</i>
<i>chunin.</i>

248
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:30,463
{\an1}Yes, way to go, Neji!

249
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:31,694
{\an1}Hey,...Congrat's!

250
00:20:32,328 --> 00:20:33,827
{\an1}Thank you all, very much!

251
00:20:36,092 --> 00:20:38,091
{\an1}And thanks to both of you as
well!

252
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,654
{\an1}<i>I made it to chunin because of</i>
<i>the great teamwork of Team Guy!</i>

253
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,818
{\an1}Sure thing! Our three-man squad
is forever, right?

254
00:20:46,318 --> 00:20:48,184
{\an1}Yes. I hope that's true.

255
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:50,449
{\an1}And I finally overtook Naruto!

256
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,677
{\an1}Oh, man. He's gonna be seriously
upset that he missed the Chunin
Exams.

257
00:20:56,544 --> 00:21:00,041
{\an1}I wonder if Naruto is busy
training, right now...

258
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:09,767
{\an1}<i>Soon it'll be time to wrap up</i>

{\an1}Guess that chest wound of yours
still hurts, huh?

261
00:21:16,097 --> 00:21:18,095
{\an1}Well, listen, you just rest up
for now!

262
00:21:19,827 --> 00:21:22,326
{\an1}I'm gonna continue my training
on my own!

263
00:22:56,591 --> 00:22:58,091
{\an1}<i>Hang in there, Naruto!</i>

264
00:22:58,423 --> 00:23:00,755
{\an1}<i>But why?! My jutsu's not</i>
<i>working!</i>

265
00:23:03,254 --> 00:23:07,085
{\an4}<i>It's because Nine Tails was</i>
<i>extracted! But there's a way to</i>
<i>save him! And that's why we're</i>
<i>hurrying, right now!</i>

266
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:09,149
{\an1}<i>There's someone else where</i>
<i>Sasuke is.</i>

267
00:23:09,183 --> 00:23:11,082
{\an1}<i>You recognize the chakra?</i>

268
00:23:11,414 --> 00:23:14,247
{\an1}<i>No, but this chakra has a real</i>
<i>nasty feel to it.</i>

269

<i>"On the Brink of Death"</i>
