1
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,707
Who are you?

2
00:00:14,074 --> 00:00:16,476
{\an1}Just tell us, who
are you, really?

3
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:22,478
{\an1}Nobody. I don't want to be
anybody. I just want to
fulfill Project Tsuki no Me.

4
00:00:22,512 --> 00:00:24,079
{\an1}That will be enough.

5
00:00:25,147 --> 00:00:30,449
{\an1}It is not worth living in
this world where only
despair exists.

6
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:35,918
{\an1}You Jinchuriki had Tailed
Beasts forced upon you.

7
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:38,886
All you've ever
experienced is despair...

8
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:44,456
{\an1}Am I wrong? Surely, you
ought to understand my
despair, at least a little...

9
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:48,991
{\an1}And just who the hell
are you to decide...

10
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:52,993
{\an1}...that having a Tailed Beast
makes me feel despair like
that?!

11
00:00:55,227 --> 00:00:57,761
{\an1}Even if you think that this
world is worthless.

12
00:00:58,328 --> 00:01:01,897
{\an1}Do you seriously think that
you can get away with
starting a war like this and

13
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,831
{\an1}then just coming along and try
to play that you're nobody?

14
00:01:06,932 --> 00:01:08,300
{\an1}You piss me off...

15
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:13,202
{\an1}I'm gonna tear that mask
right off your face!

16
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:16,004
Sounds good, but
me first! Yeah!

17
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:19,671
{\an1}Try to remove this mask...

18
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:28,676
...you'll end up
broken to pieces!

19
00:01:36,947 --> 00:01:40,449
Eight Tails...
Nine Tails...

20
00:01:41,016 --> 00:01:47,685
{\an1}You shall be mine... And then
I will achieve Project Tsuki
no Me!

21
00:01:58,191 --> 00:02:02,159
{\an1}Guess again! We're not gonna
let you have Nine Tails or
the Eight Tails!

22
00:02:04,194 --> 00:02:06,027
{\an1}Hold up. What's going on?

23
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,062
{\an1}I thought that their Tailed
Beasts were extracted from
them?!

24
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,263
{\an1}I can only assume that they
were made back into

25
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,164
{\an1}Jinchuriki after they
were reanimated...

26
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:17,999
{\an1}You know, the Tailed Beasts
feel a bit different than
before, too...

27
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:20,067
Be careful, Bee!

28
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:27,003
{\an1}You too, huh? This whole
situation is giving you bad
vibes?

29
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:30,605
{\an1}Best be careful for our
lives, like Eight Tails
prescribes.

30
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:32,673
[snarling]

31
00:03:16,394 --> 00:03:17,094
Lava Style!

32
00:03:17,528 --> 00:03:18,828
{\an1}Scorching Rocks Jutsu!

33
00:03:27,632 --> 00:03:31,667
{\an1}I can tell this isn't just
some case of mistaken
identity.

34
00:03:32,435 --> 00:03:35,703
{\an1}It seems my weaknesses have
already been carefully
researched.

35
00:03:36,636 --> 00:03:39,472
{\an1}But tell me, how are you
going to deal with this?

36
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:44,407
{\an1}Heh? He turned his
body to lava?!

37
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:47,610
{\an1}This one is a lot trickier
than I imagined he'd be.

38
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:51,410
{\an1}Water Style! Super Exploding
Water Shock Wave!

39
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:01,082
{\an1}He isn't just all
talk is he?

40
00:04:01,516 --> 00:04:05,351
{\an1}You really should just let
yourself be captured without
making all this fuss.

41
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:10,419
{\an1}This certainly is a pain.

42
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:28,794
{\an1}Kisame, you're back...

43
00:04:28,828 --> 00:04:31,396
{\an1}That's right. But having to
bring him back without

44
00:04:31,429 --> 00:04:34,532
{\an1}killing him was quite a
bother, I'll tell you.

45
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:46,036
{\an1}Here comes that rain
we were expecting.

46
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,770
{\an1}It looks like a big storm.

47
00:04:48,738 --> 00:04:53,507
{\an1}Come on, let's go find some
cover. Otherwise we'll catch
a chill.

48
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,941
{\an1}Our Leader's waiting for
word that we captured him.

49
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:59,976
{\an1}Immediately after we secure
him and bring him in, the
sealing of both the

50
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,378
{\an1}Three-Tails and Four-Tails
is to take place.

51
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:05,379
{\an1}So we make him wait a little
bit before the sealing
begins.

52
00:05:05,412 --> 00:05:08,548
{\an1}I mean, it's not like it's
really going to make any
difference.

53
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:11,714
{\an1}The sealing takes
a long time anyway.

54
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:18,486
{\an1}He's not looking good.

55
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,819
{\an1}You should handle the
elderly with care.

56
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:26,355
{\an1}[scoffing] You only say that
because you don't know this
guy. Nabbing a Jinchuriki

57
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:32,025
{\an1}who uses the Lava Style Jutsu of
the Four-Tails is way harder
than you think.

58
00:05:32,358 --> 00:05:34,660
{\an1}You probably can't
understand my pain,

59
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:37,395
{\an1}having not battled
the fellow directly.

60
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:41,530
[snarling]

61
00:07:44,455 --> 00:07:47,256
{\an1}Samehada's ready to fight.
That's fine by me.

62
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:51,391
{\an1}Alright! I'm totally raring
to go. Are you ready?

63
00:07:52,525 --> 00:07:54,627
{\an1}Hey, wait a second!
Octopops!

64
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:58,561
Nice moves...

65
00:07:59,995 --> 00:08:01,663
[growling roar]

66
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:06,098
{\an8}Okay! She hasn't
spied my KO!

67
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:18,870
{\an1}What?! How can she dodge it
when she didn't even see
it?! Fool, ya fool!

68
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:21,071
That isn't gonna
work, Octopops!

69
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:25,773
{\an1}This is just like the time
that I fought the Six Paths
of Pain. It's the Rinnegan!

70
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:28,309
{\an1}Their eyes are linked,
hooked up to each other!

71
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:29,975
{\an1}What the hell does
that mean?!

72
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,176
{\an1}It's like Nagato's
Gedo Jutsu!

73
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:35,479
{\an1}All six of them can see
what the others can see!

74
00:08:35,978 --> 00:08:38,113
Gah, I can't get
any words out.

75
00:08:38,847 --> 00:08:40,014
[groan]

76
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:43,449
{\an1}Yikes! It's Yugito's
Rodent Hair Ball!

77
00:08:47,218 --> 00:08:47,884
{\an1}They're following us!

78
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:51,786
{\an1}They're guided bombs. Let's
beat a retreat without any
qualms.

79
00:08:54,254 --> 00:08:54,820
{\an8}Huh?

80
00:09:09,094 --> 00:09:11,962
{\an1}Yugito's moves are different
than they were before...

81
00:09:11,995 --> 00:09:16,097
{\an1}And my designer scarf she
tore. That surprise ain't
nice.

82
00:09:16,131 --> 00:09:18,399
{\an1}Now it's only worth
half the price.

83
00:09:29,605 --> 00:09:31,506
{\an1}It's that Sharingan!

84
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,707
{\an1}That's how they're able to
track us so closely!

85
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:37,174
{\an1}They must be using that
Visual Prowess of theirs to

86
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:39,242
enhance their
Jinchuriki abilities!

87
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:45,745
{\an1}With their shared vision,
the six Jinchuriki are able
to position themselves with

88
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:50,013
{\an1}more precision and time their
attacks to their greatest
advantage!

89
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,348
{\an1}Bee! Let me talk to Naruto!

90
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:53,815
Yo!

91
00:09:57,284 --> 00:10:00,419
{\an1}Naruto... They've got both
their Tailed Beast powers

92
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:02,453
and two types of
Visual Prowess.

93
00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:05,854
{\an1}They probably know we're
here. What do we do?

94
00:10:07,623 --> 00:10:12,325
{\an1}We have no choice. We'll
just have to stop each
Jinchuriki one at a time.

95
00:10:12,358 --> 00:10:16,493
{\an1}If it's the same as with
Nagato, they're all
controlled by chakra.

96
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,028
{\an1}That time when I fought him,
there were these black rods
implanted all over each of

97
00:10:21,062 --> 00:10:23,630
{\an1}the Pains' bodies acting
as chakra receivers.

98
00:10:27,198 --> 00:10:31,267
{\an1}Oh, okay. I see. So if we
can extract or destroy those

99
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,035
{\an1}things then this Gedo Jutsu
would become undone!

100
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:40,071
{\an1}But that's going to be a
problem. It's hard enough
landing a blow on them at

101
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:43,005
all much less to
target black rods,

102
00:10:43,038 --> 00:10:45,474
{\an1}especially when we don't
even know where they are!

103
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,140
Is that it?

104
00:10:47,575 --> 00:10:49,643
Huh? Where?!

105
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:53,444
{\an1}Look at Yugito's bosom,
that'll clear up any
confusion.

106
00:10:53,477 --> 00:10:56,079
{\an1}Because right on there, you'll
see a black protrusion.

107
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:58,814
{\an1}Not to cause a ripple, but
at first I thought it was a
ni--

108
00:11:02,582 --> 00:11:04,550
{\an1}When they're flaunted,
it's unappealing.

109
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,150
{\an1}But just a little glimpse,
what a good feeling.

110
00:11:07,384 --> 00:11:09,785
{\an1}Hey, this battle is going to
determine the future of the

111
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:12,519
{\an1}world, and that's what
you're focusing on?!

112
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,520
That's it!

113
00:11:15,388 --> 00:11:17,155
{\an1}All right! I'll go check
out the others, too!

114
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:19,022
Naruto, wait!

115
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,392
{\an1}If our attacks won't hit
them and we can't catch
them...

116
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:31,995
{\an1}I'll let myself get hit
so I can grab them!
Man that's hot!

117
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,963
Rasengan!

118
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:39,799
There it is!

119
00:11:46,035 --> 00:11:47,902
{\an1}Now... I'll just!

120
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,650
{\an1}Are both of you okay?

121
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:20,452
{\an1}[struggling grunts]

122
00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:25,054
{\an1}Bee... We're at a
disadvantage fighting
them in the woods.

123
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:28,422
{\an1}Your field of vision in
particular is narrowed!

124
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:31,090
{\an1}You get me, don't you, Bee?!

125
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:32,957
Oh, yeah...

126
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:38,960
{\an1}Blast all this forest
around us away!

127
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:45,430
{\an1}Eight Tails, that be me! Da
rappin' Killer Bee! Wheee!

128

[roaring]

129
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:12,576
{\an1}Hang on tight, don't fall,
Naruto. Cause' now the real
fight is a go!

130

[screaming]

132

{\an1}Lord Bee has now gone
into Tailed Beast State!

133
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:54,296
{\an1}I'm sensing the mighty
chakra of Eight Tails!

134
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:57,197
{\an1}Feels like they're under
some pressure and are
on the defensive!

135
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,599
{\an1}It doesn't seem like things
are going too well right
now, does it?

136
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:02,000
{\an1}Speaking frankly...

137
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:05,168
{\an1}However, the Five Kage are
holding their own against
Madara.

138
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:07,636
{\an1}I'd say that all's
okay so far!

139
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:12,137
{\an1}Well, they are the Five
Kage! I'd assume they'd
have the edge over him!

140
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:14,506
{\an1}And what's the status
of each company?!

141
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,140
{\an1}The First and Second
Companies have almost
annihilated the enemy.

{\an1}Only twenty-seven to go!

143
00:14:22,476 --> 00:14:24,076
{\an1}Twenty-six! Twenty-five!

144
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:26,977
{\an1}I'm feeling dull...

145
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:29,313
...but I'm not
about to give up!

146
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:35,248
{\an1}Just a few more and we'll
finally be done here!

147
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:39,284
{\an1}Hey! Don't act on your
own. Stop, Kurotsuchi!

148
00:14:39,317 --> 00:14:43,419
{\an1}Face it, Dad! You're way
too slow! I can handle
all these guys!

149
00:14:43,453 --> 00:14:45,187
{\an1}So leave the rest to me!

150
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:50,457
{\an1}Earth Style! Erupt!

151
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,826
[screaming]

152
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:05,931
{\an1}The Third Company is down
to only two reanimations
left now.

153
00:15:05,963 --> 00:15:10,098
{\an1}Out of the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen of the Mist, only
Mangetsu Hozuki remains.

154
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:17,636
{\an1}I'm actually getting kinda
bored fighting against all
these white guys.

155
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,503
Yeah...

156
00:15:31,975 --> 00:15:33,910
{\an1}The Seven Ninja Swordsmen
of the Mist...

157
00:15:34,778 --> 00:15:36,077
Zabuza Momochi.

158
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:38,011
Ameyuri Ringo.

159
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:41,080
{\an1}Kushimaru Kuriarare.

160
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,482
Jinin Akebino.

161
00:15:44,048 --> 00:15:45,316
{\an1}Jinpachi Munashi.

162
00:15:46,316 --> 00:15:47,817
Fuguki Suikazan.

163
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:52,552
{\an1}The only one left is
Mangetsu Hozuki.

164
00:16:04,358 --> 00:16:08,327
{\an1}Alright then, time to show
them the way of the Samurai.

165
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:14,964
{\an1}Time to show them the Ninja
Way of Puppet Masters.
Let's do this!

166
00:16:15,996 --> 00:16:18,764
{\an1}The Fifth Company appears to
need a little more time...

167
00:16:18,798 --> 00:16:22,066
{\an1}But there's no doubt that
they have the upper hand!

168
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:26,034
{\an1}All right! Get word to the
First, Second, Third and
Fifth Companies that as soon

169
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,503
{\an1}as they wrap things
up where they are

170
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:31,270
{\an1}they're to head over to
provide support to Naruto
and Lord Bee!

171
00:16:31,605 --> 00:16:33,739
{\an1}Now, Lord Ao! Their
coordinates!

172
00:16:38,341 --> 00:16:40,709
Wow! No way!

173
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:58,951
{\an1}They're all knocked out!

174
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:02,118
{\an1}This is our chance! Seal
them away now, Bee!

175
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,387
{\an1}Octopops! You know
a Sealing Jutsu?!

176
00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:08,788
{\an1}It doesn't matter if
those rods are controlling
them or not!

177
00:17:08,822 --> 00:17:10,990
{\an1}We'll just tie them
up with Ink Clones!

178
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,958
Sealing Jutsu!
Octopus Hold!

179
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:32,165
That's it!

180
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:37,802
{\an1}That's only one of Bee's
Sealing Jutsu! It takes just
three seconds to work, too!

181
00:17:38,536 --> 00:17:42,704
{\an1}The ink will completely
cover their bodies and
harden, incapacitating them!

182
00:17:42,738 --> 00:17:46,740
{\an1}Once they're immobile,
we can just pull those
rods out!

183
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:49,173
One!

184
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:50,742
Two!

185
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,543
Three!

186
00:17:57,745 --> 00:18:01,046
{\an1}Oh, wow! Now that is some
seriously awesome...

187
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:02,514
...sealing?

188
00:18:03,948 --> 00:18:09,050
{\an1}Uh... No... Actually, instead
the enemy did an awesome
power-up.

189
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:17,388
Go...

190
00:18:18,688 --> 00:18:21,790
{\an1}Why, that masked jerk!
He's just been hiding
in the ground!

191
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:35,262
Bug Bite!

192
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,564
Cat Claws!

193
00:18:40,131 --> 00:18:41,033
Leech Slip!

194
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:45,834
{\an1}It's super-alkaline fluid!
Your skin's melting!

195
00:18:47,068 --> 00:18:47,902
Octopops!

196
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:49,202
Coral Palm!

197
00:18:52,804 --> 00:18:53,738
{\an1}What the hell is...?!

198
00:18:54,104 --> 00:18:55,005
Naruto!

199
00:18:57,273 --> 00:18:58,674
{\an1}Floral Mountain!

200
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:07,110
{\an1}This is not good! I didn't
think they could go into

201
00:19:07,144 --> 00:19:09,478
{\an1}Tailed Beast State in
their current condition!

202
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,881
{\an1}Naruto! We need to retreat
and regroup for now!

203
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,616
Horn Hit!

204
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:19,617
[groaning]

205
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,486
Hmph...

206
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:43,561
I can't move!

207
00:19:50,265 --> 00:19:51,298
Bastard!

208
00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:55,867
{\an1}Even if you are Jinchuriki,
six against two is bad odds.

209
00:19:58,636 --> 00:20:01,704
{\an1}Once I touch you, I win!

210
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,105
No!

211
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:13,876
{\an1}Uber Leaf Superhuman
Hurricane!

212
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:35,786
{\an1}They used Naruto as bait and
waited for the moment I
materialized...

213
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,554
What a nuisance!

214
00:20:38,688 --> 00:20:41,489
{\an1}It's Bushier Brow and
Kakashi Sensei!

215
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:51,060
{\an1}Hmph! Two more joining
the party is not going
to change a thing.

216
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:55,763
{\an1}Not against my Visual
Prowess and power of
the Tailed Beasts...

217
00:20:56,963 --> 00:20:59,064
{\an1}We have a Sharingan
too, you know.

218
00:21:00,065 --> 00:21:02,165
{\an1}That's right! And don't
forget we have the Noble

219
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:04,500
Blue Beast of
the Leaf as well!

220
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,955
{\an1}Kakashi Sensei! Bushier
Brow Sensei! You both came!

221
00:22:59,989 --> 00:23:02,189
{\an1}I can't just sit back and
relax, not while my student

222
00:23:02,222 --> 00:23:04,257
from Team 7 is
working so hard!

223
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:09,926
{\an1}Oh! Right! Him! He's got a
Sharingan and a Rinnegan
that are linked, left eye to

224
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:11,994
right eye, and
uh, um, uh...

225
00:23:12,027 --> 00:23:14,494
{\an1}Just calm down! I don't get
a single word you're saying!

226
00:23:14,528 --> 00:23:19,631
{\an1}Next time on Naruto
Shippuden: "Four Tails, the
King of Sage Monkeys."

227
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:23,266
{\an1}Naruto, remember, don't let
your guard down just 'cause
I'm here!
