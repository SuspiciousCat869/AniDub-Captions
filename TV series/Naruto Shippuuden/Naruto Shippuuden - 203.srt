1
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:15,552
{\an7}<i>This... has to be genjutsu!</i>

2
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:23,363
{\an7}<i>These guys are using each</i>
<i>other's attacks to distract us!</i>

3
00:00:23,396 --> 00:00:26,835
{\an7}<i>I can't believe I fell for it.</i>
<i>Damn it!</i>

4
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:34,378
{\an8}<i>Can't... move...</i>

5
00:00:40,287 --> 00:00:42,222
{\an1}YAAAA Ha ha ha ha ha!

6
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:45,761
{\an1}I killed him! I just
killed the big guy!

7
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:49,466
{\an1}Now, who's next?!
Ha haaaaaa!!

8
00:00:49,499 --> 00:00:50,133
Haugh!

9
00:01:05,589 --> 00:01:06,657
<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>That's a lie!</i>

10
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,359
{\an1}You're making all that up!

11
00:01:08,993 --> 00:01:11,162
{\an1}It can't be. It can't.

12
00:01:11,597 --> 00:01:14,434
{\an4}[Kakashi]
Your jokes aren't funny.
Who'd believe a story
like that?

13
00:01:14,768 --> 00:01:18,974
I'm not lying.
Everything I said
about Itachi is true.

14
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:22,980
He died for Sasuke.
and for the Hidden Leaf
Village as well.

15
00:01:40,104 --> 00:01:41,572
{\an1}[Kakashi]
It doesn't make sense.

16
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:45,111
{\an1}If what you say is true,
and Sasuke knows it,

17
00:01:45,144 --> 00:01:47,280
{\an1}then why would he
ever help the Akatsuki?!

18
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:51,653
{\an1}I would think he'd return
to the Hidden Leaf to
carry on Itachi's will.

19
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,555
Hmph.

20
00:01:55,524 --> 00:01:58,830
{\an4}[Madara]
As Sasuke's teacher and as his
friends, you all assume that
you know his true feelings.

21
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:01,934
But you couldn't be
more in the dark.

22
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:05,538
{\an1}<i>He's the real thing.</i>
<i>A true avenger!</i>

23
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:09,845
You made him that way,
didn't you?!

24
00:02:10,445 --> 00:02:12,381
{\an1}No. It wasn't me.

25
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:16,620
{\an1}Sasuke chose this
path all on his own.

26
00:02:16,855 --> 00:02:17,522
[gasp]

27
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:22,763
You're a liar!
That's not true!

28
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:25,166
I took a gamble,

29
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:30,640
{\an1}on whether he would take on
Itachi's will, or seek revenge
against the Hidden Leaf.

30
00:02:32,143 --> 00:02:34,679
He chose vengeance.

31
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:38,017
That means he is
one of my kind.

32
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:47,596
{\an4}<i>Sasuke's goal now is to wreak</i>
<i>vengeance upon the Hidden Leaf</i>
<i>for what they did to Itachi and</i>
<i>to the entire Uchiha clan.</i>

33
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:51,469
Why...

34
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,839
Why would he?!

35
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:58,946
{\an1}How did this whole thing
turn into such a big mess?!

36
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,683
{\an1}Why did he decide
to choose revenge?!

37
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:07,624
{\an1}It couldn't be helped.
It's the Uchiha clan's
blood-soaked destiny of hate.

38
00:03:08,293 --> 00:03:12,132
{\an1}It's a curse that
has been passed down
through the ages.

39
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:14,467
A curse?

40
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:22,111
{\an4}That's right. A curse of hatred
that began generations ago with
the father of all shinobi, the
Sage of the Six Paths.

41
00:03:22,812 --> 00:03:24,448
{\an1}Sage of the Six Paths?

42
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:26,685
{\an1}But that's nothing
but a myth!

43
00:03:26,718 --> 00:03:30,057
{\an1}The Rinnegan was simply
a random mutation,
that's all.

44
00:03:30,324 --> 00:03:33,261
But myths are often
based on the truth.

45
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:40,271
{\an1}The Sage of the Six Paths taught
ninshu, the shinobi creed, and
tried to foster world peace.

46
00:03:40,604 --> 00:03:43,809
{\an1}<i>But his end came before</i>
<i>he fulfilled his dream.</i>

47
00:03:44,176 --> 00:03:50,218
{\an1}<i>The Sage bequeathed his will</i>
<i>and also his teachings to</i>
<i>his two children, both sons.</i>

48
00:03:50,484 --> 00:03:53,789
{\an1}<i>The older son had been</i>
<i>born with the Sage's eyes,</i>

49
00:03:53,823 --> 00:03:56,994
{\an1}<i>granting him chakra powers</i>
<i>and mental energy.</i>

50
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:59,731
{\an1}<i>He knew strength was</i>
<i>necessary for peace.</i>

51
00:04:00,398 --> 00:04:04,337
{\an1}<i>The younger son had</i>
<i>been born with the gift</i>
<i>of the Sage's body,</i>

52
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:10,078
{\an1}<i>granting him stamina and</i>
<i>physical energy. He knew love</i>
<i>was necessary for peace.</i>

53
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:17,188
{\an1}On his deathbed,
the Sage chose a
single successor.

54
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:23,364
{\an1}His decision created the
eternal curse of hatred that
has continued for generations.

55
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,199
{\an1}What do you mean by that?

56
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:34,045
{\an4}The Sage decided to choose not
the older brother who sought
strength, but the younger
brother, who sought love.

57
00:04:34,413 --> 00:04:36,983
{\an1}<i>And made the second</i>
<i>son his successor.</i>

58
00:04:37,616 --> 00:04:44,327
{\an4}<i>The firstborn, who had long</i>
<i>expected to follow in his</i>
<i>father's footsteps, could</i>
<i>not accept the decision.</i>

59
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,031
{\an1}<i>Filled with rage, he declared</i>
<i>war on his younger brother.</i>

60
00:04:48,065 --> 00:04:54,274
{\an4}<i>Even as time passed and blood</i>
<i>ties thinned, the descendants</i>
<i>of the two brothers continued</i>
<i>to battle.</i>

61
00:04:54,673 --> 00:04:59,080
{\an1}<i>The descendants of the</i>
<i>older brother came to</i>
<i>be known as the Uchiha,</i>

62
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:02,885
{\an1}<i>And the descendants of</i>
<i>the younger brother</i>
<i>were called the Senju.</i>

63
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:09,861
{\an1}<i>As an Uchiha, my battle with the</i>
<i>First Hokage, Hashirama Senju,</i>
<i>was destined to occur.</i>

64
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,407
{\an1}This may be only
our second meeting,

65
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:22,946
{\an1}<i>But I can tell that you hold</i>
<i>Senju's Will of Fire within you.</i>

66
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:26,952
{\an1}<i>I can see the First Hokage</i>
<i>enduring within you. </i>

67
00:05:27,652 --> 00:05:33,660
{\an1}Even in death, he lives on.
He, whom I so admired,
yet was my rival.

68
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,800
{\an1}<i>And the man I hated most.</i>

69
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:46,980
{\an1}<i>Senju and Uchiha.</i>
<i>The Will of Fire and hatred.</i>
<i>Naruto and Sasuke.</i>

70
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,748
<i>The two of you.</i>

71
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:53,423
{\an1}<i>You are just the next in</i>
<i>line to be chosen by Destiny.</i>

72
00:05:54,824 --> 00:05:58,662
{\an1}<i>The Uchiha clan is cursed</i>
<i>with a destiny of vengeance.</i>

73
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:04,071
{\an1}Sasuke has shouldered
the entire burden of
the Uchiha's hatred,

74
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:08,609
{\an1}and intends to strike
deep into the world
with that curse.

75
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:17,489
{\an1}<i>That hate is his most</i>
<i>powerful weapon, his friend,</i>
<i>and the source of his power.</i>

76
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,528
{\an1}<i>That is Sasuke's Ninja Way!</i>

77
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:07,408
Sasuke's Ninja Way

78
00:08:10,446 --> 00:08:11,615
{\an8}<i>Chidori!</i>

79
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:14,285
Raaaahhh!
Elbow Bolt!

80
00:08:26,134 --> 00:08:30,274
{\an1}A thrust attack that
uses Lightning Style
to increase its power?

81
00:08:30,507 --> 00:08:33,211
{\an1}That's just like
Kakashi Hatake's jutsu!

82
00:08:33,945 --> 00:08:38,551
{\an4}I'm impressed that you
were actually able to
touch me through my
Lightning Style armor.

83
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,888
{\an1}That's some jutsu
you've got there.

84
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,823
{\an1}What!? He failed?!

85
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:45,561
That's right, and now...
Sasuke's a dead man!

86
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:51,136
{\an7}<i>No way! So much chakra!</i>

87
00:08:51,603 --> 00:08:53,606
Yaahhhhh!!

88
00:08:54,574 --> 00:08:55,976
Liger Bomb!

89
00:09:03,687 --> 00:09:04,689
It's over.

90
00:09:10,962 --> 00:09:13,667
{\an1}<i>So that's the Raikage's</i>
<i>shinobi taijutsu.</i>

91
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:16,771
{\an1}There's no way Sasuke
could have survived that.

92
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,108
{\an1}I guess we didn't need
reinforcements after all.

93
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:20,276
Hn?

94
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:29,289
Raaagh!

95
00:09:34,963 --> 00:09:37,633
{\an7}<i>So that's the Mangekyo</i>
<i>Sharingan, huh?</i>

96
00:09:38,234 --> 00:09:39,370
Hngh!

97
00:09:40,304 --> 00:09:41,939
{\an1}Cee, you all right?

98
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:45,111
Darui. is your
fight finished?

99
00:09:45,478 --> 00:09:46,145
{\an1}Maybe.

100
00:09:47,481 --> 00:09:51,252
{\an1}No one has ever survived
the Liger Bomb before.
Not until right now.

101
00:09:51,553 --> 00:09:53,889
{\an1}And take a look
at those bones!
What is he?!

102
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:57,026
I fell for his
genjutsu and lost.

103
00:09:57,228 --> 00:10:00,165
{\an1}<i>I still don't have full</i>
<i>control of my body.</i>

104
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:03,604
Geniuses like him
are extremely rare.

105
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,308
{\an1}Sasuke Uchiha...
He's a stubborn one!

106
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:09,345
<i>Reinforcements?!</i>

107
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:21,796
Hey, Cee.

108
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:25,099
{\an1}What's with Sasuke's eyes;
don't they look different now?

109
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,334
[gasp]

110
00:10:26,535 --> 00:10:28,638
{\an1}Is that the Mangekyo Sharingan?!

111
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:33,645
{\an7}<i>I get it! That's why</i>
<i>Lord Raikage ramped</i>
<i>himself up even more.</i>

112
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:37,116
{\an1}<i>He's going to counter</i>
<i>with Teleportation Jutsu!</i>

113
00:10:37,384 --> 00:10:38,985
{\an1}Yyyahhh!

114
00:10:40,288 --> 00:10:43,592
{\an1}You know, maybe I am too
vulnerable to Lightning Style.

115
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:46,996
{\an1}My body is too numb now
to liquefy properly.

116
00:10:48,332 --> 00:10:52,605
{\an7}<i>The Raikage's chakra</i>
<i>has grown enormously!</i>
<i>He's at Tailed Beast levels!</i>

117
00:10:55,576 --> 00:10:56,945
Bring it, boy!

118
00:11:21,845 --> 00:11:22,881
Amaterasu!

119
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,287
Ah! Aaahh!

120
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,559
{\an1}Put out the flames!

121
00:11:31,993 --> 00:11:33,829
They're not
ordinary flames!
Get back!

122
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:39,135
{\an7}<i>The Amaterasu, </i>
<i>flames that ignite along</i>
<i>one's line of sight.</i>
<i>That must be it!</i>

123
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,443
{\an1}Lateral Bolt of Pain!

124
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,983
{\an7}<i>Nice! A shield of black flames!</i>

125
00:11:49,017 --> 00:11:51,854
{\an7}<i>Nothing can match the</i>
<i>Raikage's teleportation speed.</i>

126
00:11:51,887 --> 00:11:54,991
{\an7}<i>If you can't keep up, then use</i>
<i>a shield that can't be touched!</i>

127
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:57,628
{\an7}<i>Now, he can't just</i>
<i>recklessly attack Sasuke!</i>

128
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:01,000
{\an7}<i>He manipulated the</i>
<i>black flames?!</i>

129
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:03,369
{\an7}<i>Changed their</i>
<i>chakra form, too!</i>

130
00:12:03,704 --> 00:12:06,841
{\an7}<i>He's even more proficient with</i>
<i>the black flames than Itachi?</i>

131
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:12,516
{\an1}Don't underestimate the Raikage!

132
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:14,384
[gasp]

133
00:12:15,053 --> 00:12:16,822
Lord Raikage!
No, don't!

134
00:12:16,855 --> 00:12:18,959
{\an1}Damn, he's sacrificing
his left arm.

135
00:12:21,328 --> 00:12:22,329
{\an1}Bleagh!

136
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,635
{\an1}You're finished now!

137
00:12:27,102 --> 00:12:28,771
Guillotine Drop!

138
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:30,608
<i>[Sasuke]</i>
<i>Inferno Style! </i>

00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,279
{\an8}<i>Sasuke!</i>

142
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:44,027
{\an8}<i>Sand?!</i>

143
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:45,929
{\an8}<i>This is...!</i>

144
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,311
{\an1}Gaara of the Sand.

145
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:00,950
Wind Scythe Jutsu!

146
00:13:07,225 --> 00:13:10,630
{\an1}So these are the eternal flames
of the Amaterasu, huh?

147
00:13:11,196 --> 00:13:15,804
{\an1}All you samurai, stay back.
This is a problem for the
shinobi world.

148
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:18,908
{\an1}There is no need for samurai
to become casualties.

149
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:22,079
Thank you,
Lord Kazekage.

150
00:13:22,113 --> 00:13:22,981
{\an1}Uggh...

151
00:13:23,848 --> 00:13:24,916
What's going on?

152
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:27,253
{\an1}Why'd you interfere,
Kazekage?!

153
00:13:27,286 --> 00:13:29,389
{\an1}Your answer will determine
your punishment!

154
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:35,297
{\an4}[Gaara]
If you had continued with your
attack, the black flames would
have further injured you.

155
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:40,504
{\an1}<i>Besides, I wish to speak</i>
<i>to Sasuke Uchiha.</i>

156
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,176
Humph.

157
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,348
{\an1}Boss! Your arm!

158
00:13:48,382 --> 00:13:50,652
Cee, hurry and
stop the bleeding!

159
00:13:50,685 --> 00:13:52,588
{\an1}Then I'm going
after Sasuke again!

160
00:13:52,621 --> 00:13:53,522
Yes, sir!

161
00:13:57,729 --> 00:14:01,467
{\an8}<i>Sasuke managed to get</i>
<i>through Lord Raikage's</i>
<i>Lightning Style Armor,</i>

162
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,270
{\an7}<i>and he survived two</i>
<i>seriously heavy attacks.</i>

163
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:09,178
{\an7}<i>His left eye ignites</i>
<i>the Amaterasu,</i>

164
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:14,418
{\an7}<i>And his right eye can change</i>
<i>the chakra form of the Black</i>
<i>Flames, I'm sure of it.</i>

165
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:21,661
{\an7}<i>Perhaps this Sasuke</i>
<i>truly did capture Bee.</i>

166
00:14:29,907 --> 00:14:33,178
{\an7}<i>Which means that shinobi are</i>
<i>still growing and advancing.</i>

167
00:14:36,716 --> 00:14:39,187
{\an1}Your eyes are still as
they were in the past.

168
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:47,664
{\an1}As I told you, both of us
possess the exact same eyes.

169
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:52,504
{\an1}Eyes that always hunger
for power and are full
of hatred, as well.

170
00:14:53,106 --> 00:14:56,811
{\an1}Eyes that seek revenge
against all those who
made you so lonely,

171
00:14:56,844 --> 00:14:59,381
{\an1}eyes that burn to see
all of them dead!

172
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:13,201
{\an5}I have come to realize
that making vengeance
one's bread of life does
not resolve anything.

173
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:15,304
{\an1}It's not too late for you.

174
00:15:15,804 --> 00:15:19,341
{\an1}Don't withdraw into your own
world, obsessed with hatred.

175
00:15:20,277 --> 00:15:22,746
<i>Or you won't be</i>
<i>able to return.</i>

176
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:26,986
{\an1}So, if I were to return?
What is there for me?

177
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,755
{\an1}Forget it, Gaara.

178
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:31,993
{\an1}Naruto already failed
to convince him.

179
00:15:32,794 --> 00:15:36,299
{\an1}He's a criminal, fallen to
the level of the Akatsuki.

180
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:38,568
{\an1}He's not like you.

181
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:42,474
{\an1}Plus, the Raikage and
others harmed by the
Akatsuki won't stay silent.

182
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:46,714
{\an1}After attacking the
Five Kage Summit, he's
wanted internationally.

183
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:49,818
{\an1}Just face it, this
guy has no future.

184
00:15:53,122 --> 00:15:56,593
{\an1}Sasuke, you and I
are quite alike.

185
00:15:56,627 --> 00:15:59,832
{\an1}We've both walked through
the darkness of this world.

186
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:04,537
{\an1}So your eyes should pick up even
the faintest glimmer of light.

187
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:08,911
{\an1}In the past or even
at this moment.

188
00:16:11,147 --> 00:16:13,417
{\an1}I shut my eyes a long time ago.

189
00:16:14,018 --> 00:16:16,888
{\an1}The things I seek now lie
only in the darkness.

190
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,831
{\an1}You're the Kazekage.
Don't let your
feelings interfere.

191
00:16:28,271 --> 00:16:29,105
{\an8}<i>Gaara...</i>

192
00:16:34,446 --> 00:16:35,580
Yes.

193
00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:40,789
I know.

194
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:55,309
{\an4}[Madara]
Naruto. One day, you
will probably end up
fighting Sasuke again.

195
00:16:55,343 --> 00:16:58,180
{\an1}Or rather, I'll
throw Sasuke at you.

196
00:16:58,413 --> 00:17:01,351
{\an1}The long-predestined battle.

197
00:17:01,584 --> 00:17:05,357
{\an1}I'll have Sasuke validate the
existence of the Uchiha.

198
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:09,895
{\an1}Sasuke isn't just
your toy, you know!
Quit talking nonsense!

199
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:15,270
{\an1}You think you can make
Sasuke have a change of heart,
like you did Nagato?

200
00:17:15,304 --> 00:17:18,108
{\an1}That's even more of
a fantasy, Naruto.

201
00:17:18,808 --> 00:17:24,416
{\an4}To control others, you
must possess the ability
to manipulate the
darkness in their souls.

202
00:17:25,485 --> 00:17:29,356
{\an1}Nagato just happened to be
easily influenced, that's all.

203
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,500
Never compare
yourself to Nagato!

204
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:43,108
{\an1}<i>His methods were different than</i>
<i>mine, but he truly wanted peace.</i>
<i>But you. You're different!</i>

205
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:45,545
Heh. No doubt.

206
00:17:48,215 --> 00:17:52,422
{\an1}That's really your goal?
To validate the
existence of the Uchiha?

207
00:17:52,455 --> 00:17:54,590
{\an1}Then why collect the
Tailed Beasts?

208
00:17:55,092 --> 00:17:58,630
{\an1}What's your true
purpose, really?
Just what do you want?

209
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:03,504
Well, if I wanted
anything, it would be,

210
00:18:04,338 --> 00:18:06,207
{\an1}to be a complete form.

211
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:08,110
{\an1}Complete form?!

212
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,812
{\an1}What do you mean by that?!

213
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:15,020
Talking to you about
it now is pointless.

214
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:18,357
{\an1}I'll explain it at a more
appropriate time and place.

215
00:18:19,158 --> 00:18:22,263
It was fun, chatting
with you guys.

216
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:23,832
Later.

217
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:31,642
Sasuke, no...

218
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,760
{\an1}You block my
Inferno Style well;
I'm impressed.

219
00:18:44,994 --> 00:18:47,164
{\an1}<i>Your Ultimate Defense</i>
<i>is in good shape.</i>

220
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:50,236
{\an1}Wow! Amazing!

221
00:18:52,204 --> 00:18:52,938

<i>know right away!</i>

224

00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,722
{\an1}Ah!

226
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,092
{\an7}<i>He has a Sensory</i>
<i>Type with him!</i>

227
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:10,930
{\an1}It seems there's a Sensory-Type
ninja among our enemies.

228
00:19:10,963 --> 00:19:13,268
{\an1}They're sure to reach this
place at some point.

229
00:19:13,301 --> 00:19:14,469
{\an1}What do we do?

230
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:20,478
{\an1}For now, do nothing. When they
arrive, we'll simply slip out
amid the ensuing chaos.

231
00:19:20,511 --> 00:19:22,581
{\an1}Stop whispering
amongst yourselves!

232
00:19:23,315 --> 00:19:27,787
{\an1}I am a Sensory-type, too. I know
the enemy has found this place.

233
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:30,724
{\an1}But you three are not
to make a single move.

234
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:32,494
{\an1}We shall deal
with the enemy.

235
00:19:34,197 --> 00:19:37,568
{\an7}<i>Looks like this summit is</i>
<i>finally getting interesting!</i>

{\an1}You done yet, Cee?!

237
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,808
A little longer, sir!

238
00:19:44,743 --> 00:19:46,046
{\an1}I'll join you Sand guys!

239
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,685
{\an1}[Darui]
The first strike's mine!
And then you can follow me!

240
00:19:49,717 --> 00:19:50,385
Got it!

241
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:53,723
Good. Now,

{\an8}<i>What is this?!</i>

00:20:31,075 --> 00:20:32,010
Gaara.

248
00:20:33,145 --> 00:20:35,415
{\an1}I've got an Ultimate Defense
even greater than yours.

249
00:20:36,816 --> 00:20:39,987
Is that thing the shield
that he used to guard
against my attacks?

250
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:43,792
{\an7}<i>His chakra's the same as</i>
<i>when he used that genjutsu.</i>

251
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:46,964
{\an1}Uh, oh. This doesn't look good.

252
00:20:49,234 --> 00:20:51,103
{\an7}<i>Was this what he</i>
<i>wanted to test?</i>

253
00:20:52,371 --> 00:20:57,178
{\an7}<i>Sasuke's chakra,</i>
<i>it's so different now.</i>
<i>It's too cold!</i>

254
00:20:58,547 --> 00:21:00,282
What is that?

255
00:21:01,851 --> 00:21:04,955
{\an1}The power...of darkness.

256
00:21:08,995 --> 00:21:13,768
{\an1}A power that only those who
have awakened the Mangekyo
in both eyes can achieve.

257
00:21:14,235 --> 00:21:16,004
{\an1}This is the third power.

258
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:17,940
