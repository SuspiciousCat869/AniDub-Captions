1
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:18,585
‐Still nothing.

2
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,821
‐Do you think it
failed, Kakashi?

3
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,389
‐No, it was definitely
some impact.

4
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,258
‐But nothing's happening.

5
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,661
Hinata, are you able
to see anything?

6
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,429
‐No, I can't.

7
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,197
Even with my Byakugan
there's nothing.

8
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,065
‐Where's Naruto?

9
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,534
Isn't there any sign of him?

10
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:40,707
‐Maybe we didn't
reach him where he is.

11
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:46,813
What's worse, it looks like
we woke up to Three Tails.

12
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:50,150
Shizune.

13
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:56,356
‐Right, Sealing Team, get
ready for the Three Tails.

14
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,124
‐Got it.

15
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:01,952
‐Sai,

16
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:07,774
take Yukimaru
some place safe.

17
00:01:07,808 --> 00:01:10,010
‐Right.

18
00:01:10,043 --> 00:01:11,311
Come with me.

19
00:01:11,344 --> 00:01:12,445
‐No, I won't.

20
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,182
I'm not going anywhere
until Guren gets back.

21
00:01:16,216 --> 00:01:18,852
‐I'm sure she's OK.

22
00:01:18,885 --> 00:01:21,054
Everyone here is
thinking about Naruto,

23
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:23,356
so I know we'll see him again.

24
00:01:23,389 --> 00:01:25,726
As long as you keep
her in your thoughts,

25
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,161
Guren will come back
too, without a doubt.

26
00:01:31,064 --> 00:01:31,998
‐Shall we?

27
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:36,269
‐K.

28
00:01:36,302 --> 00:01:36,870
‐Let's go.

29
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:45,712
‐All right, then, let's begin
the Four Corners Sealing jutsu.

30
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:51,918
Four corner barrier bind!

31
00:02:04,404 --> 00:02:05,806
‐This will be dicey.

32
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:07,608
We have to hold the
Three Tails at bay

33
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:10,677
until the Sealing
Team can contain it.

34
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:14,881
‐K. I guess we'll see if wood
style works on the Three Tails,

35
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:15,381
huh?

36
00:02:20,186 --> 00:02:24,825
‐Well, for now, all
we can do is try.

37
00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:27,460
[theme music]

38
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:21,788
‐We'll wait here, all right?

39
00:04:21,822 --> 00:04:22,288
‐Um‐huh.

40
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:33,399
‐Have some.

41
00:04:33,432 --> 00:04:34,300
You'll feel better.

42
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:40,406
‐How did you do that?

43
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,809
You know what I was thinking.

44
00:04:42,843 --> 00:04:44,110
‐Not really.

45
00:04:44,144 --> 00:04:46,847
I'm always terrible
at reading people.

46
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,749
‐That can't be true.

47
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:49,415
Thank you.

48
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,435
‐Dark smoke sphere.

49
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,077
‐I need you to stay hidden, OK?

50
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:11,578
‐Um‐huh.

51
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:46,613
‐Sticky water.

52
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:26,693
‐‐[laughing] Playing
hide and seek, huh?

53
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:28,294
Let's go, kid.

54
00:06:28,328 --> 00:06:29,930
You're coming with me.

55
00:06:38,705 --> 00:06:41,975
‐I've been able to ascertain
Yukimaru's potential, as well

56
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:44,044
as the limit of his power
over the Three Tails.

57
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,092
However, we've a problem.

58
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,167
The Leaf are raising
another barrier.

59
00:07:12,613 --> 00:07:16,991
If, by some stroke of luck, they
manage to seal the Three Tails.

60
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:23,356
‐With every passing day young
Sasuke grows more powerful.

61
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:25,826
Our transference
is drawing closer.

62
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:30,597
Then the Leaf and the Akatsuki
can finally be dealt with

63
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:34,868
and this current endeavor
we embark on will ensure it.

64
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:37,237
‐We won't have to worry
about the Akatsuki

65
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,540
using the Three Tails.

66
00:07:39,573 --> 00:07:41,742
But it will force
Lord Orochimaru

67
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:45,211
to alter his plans considerably.

68
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:47,213
We can't allow that to happen.

69
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,853
If I use these we
may lose Yukimaru,

70
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:55,956
but that's preferable to
losing the Three Tails.

71
00:08:03,003 --> 00:08:06,840
Oh well, if the boy is
lost to us, then so be it.

72
00:08:06,873 --> 00:08:09,175
We can use what's
left of his power

73
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:13,313
to crush the Leaf whipping
the Three Tails into a frenzy.

74
00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:29,329
‐Where's Kabuto?

75
00:08:29,362 --> 00:08:32,232
‐Don't worry, he filled
me in on everything.

76
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:35,435
‐(LAUGHING) so four‐eyes
isn't here, huh?

77
00:08:35,468 --> 00:08:36,803
‐Too bad.

78
00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:39,405
I guess there's no one to boss
us around anymore is there?

79
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:49,349
‐We're not the same guys
you've been running with.

80
00:08:49,382 --> 00:08:51,151
‐Yeah, that's
right, and we don't

81
00:08:51,184 --> 00:08:54,187
need to hang around
with you anymore.

82
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,822
‐It's been great, really.

83
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:01,134
‐Breathin' easy now, huh?

84
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,369
‐What was that?

85
00:09:03,403 --> 00:09:06,907
‐You guys were never anything
more than pawns in this game,

86
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,775
and now I've got
you under my thumb.

87
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:11,878
You're just too
stupid to know it.

88
00:09:11,912 --> 00:09:13,146
‐Say that again.

89
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:13,980
‐Ah, forget this.

90
00:09:14,014 --> 00:09:15,516
We're through with you, buddy.

91
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:17,984
‐I say we settle this right now.

92
00:09:18,018 --> 00:09:18,685
‐Settle.

93
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:19,986
[laughing]

94
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:23,890
‐What?

95
00:09:23,924 --> 00:09:25,091
What's so funny?

96
00:09:27,794 --> 00:09:29,229
‐Any moment now.

97
00:09:36,002 --> 00:09:36,837
‐What's happening?

98
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,106
My body, it feels‐‐

99
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,609
‐Like I can't stop shaking.

100
00:09:42,643 --> 00:09:45,045
‐What is this?

101
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:46,513
‐Ah.

102
00:09:46,547 --> 00:09:49,683
‐Fools, obtaining
power always comes

103
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:52,118
with a certain degree of risk.

104
00:09:52,152 --> 00:09:55,922
You might be feeling a
few side effects, I hear.

105
00:09:55,956 --> 00:09:57,323
‐Side effects?

106
00:09:57,357 --> 00:10:02,468
‐Afraid so, and left untreated,
you'll be eaten up from within.

107
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:05,972
‐No, that's impossible.

108
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:09,910
‐Please, I don't want of die.

109
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,345
‐Unless you get some of
Kabuto's medicine in you,

110
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:16,750
it won't be long before
your power eats you alive.

111
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,185
Of course, he
entrusted it to me.

112
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,556
Pledge loyalty to Orochimaru
and I might let you have it.

113
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,560
‐All right.

114
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,194
I pledge my loyalty.

115
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,296
‐Hurry, before it's too late.

116
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,532
‐Just face it.

117
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:34,500
Try to flee all you want
to, but Lord Orochimaru

118
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:36,302
has you within his
clutches forever.

119
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,111
Kabuto wanted me
to tell you we've

120
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,147
got the Three Tails in check.

121
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,917
Once again, he's in
need of your power.

122
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:53,419
‐I can't.

123
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,956
Taking that medicine
makes my head

124
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,724
feel like it's gonna explode.

125
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:58,491
‐Be quiet.

126
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,602
You'll do as you are told.

127
00:11:01,635 --> 00:11:04,605
Guren is gone, kid,
and for all we know,

128
00:11:04,638 --> 00:11:06,907
she may never be coming back.

129
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,441
Is that what you want?

130
00:11:08,474 --> 00:11:09,576
‐Guren.

131
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,011
No, I don't.

132
00:11:11,044 --> 00:11:13,514
‐Then quit with you're
complaining and do as I say.

133
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:20,486
‐All right.

134
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:25,491
One more time, but
only one more, OK?

135
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:28,428
‐Yeah, this will
be the end of it.

136
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:44,210
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Here it comes.

137
00:12:03,504 --> 00:12:04,370
‐One of Sai's.

138
00:12:12,112 --> 00:12:17,417
It seems Guren's fellow shinobi
powered up and attacked Sai.

139
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,685
‐What?

140
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:20,353
‐Any word from Kiba's group?

141
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:23,323
‐No, not yet.

142
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:24,825
It can't be.

143
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:41,241
‐Boy, you really saved me there.

144
00:12:41,274 --> 00:12:43,810
If you hadn't gotten the idea
to dig a hole in the ground,

145
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:45,045
we would have been toast.

146
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:47,280
[whine]

147
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:47,848
‐Lee.

148
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:48,348
Tenten.

149
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:53,820
No way.

150
00:12:53,854 --> 00:12:54,655
They couldn't.

151
00:13:01,334 --> 00:13:02,603
Ah, ah, ah.

152
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:07,508
Don't worry, boy.

153
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,308
I'll be fine.

154
00:13:18,318 --> 00:13:19,520
Thank goodness.

155
00:13:19,553 --> 00:13:20,854
You guys made it.

156
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:21,755
‐Are you kidding me?

157
00:13:21,788 --> 00:13:23,356
We barely scraped by.

158
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:25,391
If I hadn't summoned a
barrier from a scroll,

159
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:26,993
we'd have been done for.

160
00:13:27,027 --> 00:13:29,663
And Lee running into battle
head first was no help either.

161
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:33,734
‐It is unforgivable, and after
all Guy Sensei's warnings,

162
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:36,503
the pride is always
enemy number one.

163
00:13:36,537 --> 00:13:37,671
‐Lee's right.

164
00:13:37,704 --> 00:13:39,540
They were stronger than
we thought they'd be.

165
00:13:39,573 --> 00:13:40,807
‐No.

166
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:43,343
The way those guys changed
wasn't normal at all.

167
00:13:43,376 --> 00:13:45,679
We got to get to the
others and warn them.

168
00:13:45,712 --> 00:13:46,179
‐Yeah.

169
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:54,621
‐This mist, they've already
pulled us into their trap.

170
00:13:57,223 --> 00:13:58,224
‐Protect the Sealing Team.

171
00:13:58,258 --> 00:13:59,059
‐Got it.

172
00:14:15,381 --> 00:14:17,350
‐Dark smoke sphere.

173
00:14:17,383 --> 00:14:18,819
‐Sticky water.

174
00:14:22,088 --> 00:14:22,689
‐Yamato.

175
00:14:22,723 --> 00:14:23,524
‐Right.

176
00:14:23,557 --> 00:14:25,125
Wood style, Tree Wall Barrier.

177
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:37,070
‐All right, out of my way.

178
00:14:40,106 --> 00:14:42,543
‐Wood style, Giant Forest jutsu.

179
00:14:56,422 --> 00:14:57,390
‐Parasitic Insects.

180
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,304
‐What the‐‐ Hey, stop.

181
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:04,805
Stop!

182
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:25,826
‐Akamura, what is it?

183
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:27,027
Hold on a minute, guys.

184
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,994
There's something wrong.

185
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:32,198
‐The enemy?

186
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,867
‐No, we're OK.

187
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,837
‐It doesn't seem like
there's a threat or anything.

188
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,239
‐You were able to tell what
Akamaru was thinking, Tenten?

189
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,310
‐Oh, no.

190
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:44,778
Sai.

191
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,386
‐So the Sealing isn't complete.

192
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,156
The Three Tails is still
spreading its mist.

193
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,126
‐It's coming.

194
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,101
It's coming.

195
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,045
‐Gather all of your chakra.

196
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:12,613
‐OK.

197
00:16:12,646 --> 00:16:13,547
‐You've got it.

198
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,548
‐All right, cha!

199
00:16:18,552 --> 00:16:19,520
‐This is it.

200
00:16:26,492 --> 00:16:29,029
Take them, Yukimura.

201
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:30,797
Come on, let's go.

202
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:32,966
You want Guren to
return, don't you?

203
00:16:37,403 --> 00:16:38,371
‐All right then.

204
00:16:38,404 --> 00:16:39,840
I understand.

205
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,308
I have to do it for Guren.

206
00:16:42,342 --> 00:16:43,777
She needs me to return to.

207
00:17:03,103 --> 00:17:03,937
‐I made it back.

208
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:07,541
Pain is good.

209
00:17:07,574 --> 00:17:08,942
It means I'm still alive.

210
00:17:20,687 --> 00:17:21,087
Naruto.

211
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:33,099
Naruto, wake up.

212
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:38,939
‐Yukimaru, is he OK?

213
00:17:38,972 --> 00:17:41,374
‐Stop blabbering
and get up already.

214
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:41,875
‐Huh?

215
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:48,815
Wait a sec, we're back.

216
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:49,315
‐Yeah.

217
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:54,254
‐Yukimaru.

218
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:55,756
Yukimaru, where is he?

219
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:10,110
‐Bloody smoke clone.

220
00:18:16,116 --> 00:18:17,551
‐No, stop it!

221
00:18:22,523 --> 00:18:24,024
Oh, my, it tickles.

222
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:24,525
‐What?

223
00:18:29,996 --> 00:18:31,264
‐Oh, such a shame.

224
00:18:31,297 --> 00:18:34,835
Your cute little bugs can't
seem to get a hold on me.

225
00:18:34,868 --> 00:18:37,571
Well, lets say we cut
to the chase then?

226
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:06,039
‐Interesting.

227
00:19:06,072 --> 00:19:08,742
I'll take a crack at this one.

228
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:10,511
Smoke dragon arise!

229
00:19:25,391 --> 00:19:27,327
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Sai was right.

230
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,296
They're totally different
than they were before.

231
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,751
‐Help.

232
00:19:50,784 --> 00:19:52,619
Shizune, help me.

233
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:54,588
‐She's at her limit.

234
00:19:54,621 --> 00:19:55,522
Come on.

235
00:19:55,556 --> 00:19:57,524
Hang in there, Ino.

236
00:19:57,558 --> 00:19:59,526
You can do this.

237
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:05,906
‐Shizune.

238
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:13,514
‐Ahhhhh!

239
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:23,690
‐Oh no.

240
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:24,958
He's using his power.

241
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:26,326
‐This is bad.

242
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:34,968
[theme music]

243
00:22:01,602 --> 00:22:05,972
‐Yukimaru may not forgive me
when he learns the whole truth.

244
00:22:06,006 --> 00:22:07,908
‐That's still weighing
you down, huh?

245
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:10,777
‐I'm prepared to
protect him, it's just‐‐

246
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:13,146
‐Think about him and only him.

247
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:15,649
Even if he never
comes back to you.

248
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:18,719
He could push you
away, despise you,

249
00:22:18,752 --> 00:22:20,420
none of that should matter.

250
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:21,722
‐You're right.

251
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:26,159
If that makes the two
of us fools, so be it.

252
00:22:26,192 --> 00:22:29,129
‐Next time, "Memory of Guilt."
