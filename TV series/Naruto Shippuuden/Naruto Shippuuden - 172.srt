2
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:56,850
-Good.

3
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:57,851
You're awake.

4
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,152
-Hm?

5
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,654
{\an1}Great Lord Elder?

6
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:06,392
{\an1}-I thought your life would be in
danger if I left you like that.

7
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,593
{\an1}-I'm beholden to you.

8
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:15,001
{\an1}-Can't wait even though
you're still ailing.

9
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:18,271
{\an1}-This actually helps
me heal faster.

10
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,173
{\an1}But tell me, what of the boy?

11
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:23,476
{\an1}-Naruto's presently
speaking with the real Pain.

12
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:24,477
-Hm?

13
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,345
{\an1}Speaking with Pain?

14
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:31,317
{\an1}-The two children of prophecy
have come face to face.

15
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,519
{\an1}How will they settle
this, I wonder.

16
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:41,493
{\an1}-I need to hear your stories.

17
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:43,128
{\an1}Then I'll give you
my final response.

18
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:47,934
-Very well.

19
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:50,870
{\an1}We'll tell you everything
about our Pain.

20
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:51,904
-Nagato.

21
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,405
{\an1}It's a waste of time.

22
00:02:53,438 --> 00:02:54,907
{\an1}Just deal with him now.

23
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,641
-Wait, Konan.

24
00:02:56,675 --> 00:03:00,712
{\an1}I want to hear the
response he comes up with.

25
00:03:00,745 --> 00:03:04,749
{\an1}Besides, I doubt I could
take him down too easily.

26
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:07,017
{\an1}After all, he did
crush the six Pains

27
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:08,620
{\an1}and make it here all by himself.

28
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:15,125
{\an1}Two moments define
my greatest pain.

29
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:18,062
{\an1}The first of these was
the death of my parents.

30
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:21,766
{\an1}The Hidden Rain village had been
caught up in the great nations'

31
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,267
{\an1}war and became a battlefield.

32
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:36,815
{\an1}MAN: Found anything yet?

33
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:38,683
{\an1}MAN: Yeah, some canned food.

34
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:40,986
{\an1}Our first meal in four days.

35
00:03:41,018 --> 00:03:43,287
{\an1}MAN: No, three days.

36
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,121
MAN: Whatever.

37
00:03:44,154 --> 00:03:44,923
Let's just eat.

38
00:03:44,956 --> 00:03:46,257
{\an1}I'm starving here.

39
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,225
{\an1}MAN: We should search the
rest of this place afterward.

40
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:49,260
{\an1}We might find more stuff.

41
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,865
{\an1}-Let's get outside,
while they're distracted.

42
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:57,334
{\an1}-But what if they
see us, father?

43
00:03:57,368 --> 00:03:59,603
I'm scared.

44
00:03:59,637 --> 00:04:01,405
{\an1}-Don't worry, now.

45
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:03,474
{\an1}Let's just go and
be completely quiet.

46
00:04:27,965 --> 00:04:29,432
{\an1}MAN: Man, that's good.

47
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,343
-Who's there?

48
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,181
Damn.

49
00:04:45,214 --> 00:04:46,749
enemies!

50
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:47,383
-Run now.

51
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:48,451
Get out of here!

52
00:04:48,484 --> 00:04:49,385
-Nagato.

53
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:49,819
Go!

54
00:04:58,027 --> 00:05:00,128
Nagato.

55
00:05:00,162 --> 00:05:01,631
Hurry.

56
00:05:01,664 --> 00:05:02,130
Run.

57
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:07,169
-Run, Nagato!

58
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:09,072
{\an1}Run, and don't look back.

59
00:05:09,104 --> 00:05:09,572
Hurry!

60
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:24,988
{\an1}-He-- He's just a kid.

61
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:26,388
-Oh no.

62
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:28,457
{\an1}These people weren't shinobi!

63
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,892
-What do we do?

64
00:05:29,926 --> 00:05:31,961
{\an1}How did this happen?

65
00:05:31,995 --> 00:05:35,098
{\an1}How could we mistake
them for the enemy?

66
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:35,831
Damn it.

67
00:05:43,438 --> 00:05:44,706
We didn't know.

68
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,476
{\an1}We didn't have any idea
that there were still

69
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:50,812
{\an1}any civilians left out
here in the war zone.

70
00:05:50,846 --> 00:05:52,614
{\an1}I'm so sorry, kid.

71
00:06:17,906 --> 00:06:21,842
{\an1}-What is-- What happened here?

72
00:06:21,876 --> 00:06:23,344
Father?

73
00:06:23,377 --> 00:06:24,445
Mother?

74
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:25,413
Oh no.

75
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,960
[scream]

76
00:06:39,994 --> 00:06:43,164
{\an1}-My parents died all
because of the shinobi war

77
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:46,100
{\an1}that your Hidden Leaf started.

78
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:50,336
{\an1}I have never forgotten the
searing pain of that moment.

79
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,206
I've endured it
to this very day.

80
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:56,209
{\an1}That pain transformed
into hate, but it also

81
00:06:56,242 --> 00:07:00,014
{\an1}brought my powers into bloom.

82
00:07:00,047 --> 00:07:03,249
It was only much
later that I realized

83
00:07:03,283 --> 00:07:06,187
{\an1}that I was the one who
killed those two Leaf ninja.

84
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,129
-Well mother.

85
00:07:15,162 --> 00:07:16,663
Well, father.

86
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:17,630
Goodbye now.

87
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,973
{\an1}NAGATO: Food was so scarce, I
was forced to leave my home.

88
00:07:34,114 --> 00:07:35,215
{\an1}-That's the last of it.

89
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,565
{\an1}YOUNG NAGATO: I'm
too hungry to walk.

90
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:11,049
-Thank you.

91
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:14,686
{\an1}If you hadn't just woken me
up, I'd probably be dead.

92
00:08:24,763 --> 00:08:26,098
I'm sorry.

93
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,599
{\an1}You shouldn't be following me.

94
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:30,269
{\an1}I have nothing to give you.

95
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,938
{\an1}I don't have anything
to eat for either of us.

96
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:42,480
{\an1}Excuse me, do you have anything
to eat you could share with me?

97
00:08:42,513 --> 00:08:50,454
I-- Thank you.

98
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,091
{\an1}It's just been so long
since I've eaten anything.

99
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:57,762
{\an1}-I'm sorry, son, but I've got
nothing I can give to you.

100
00:08:57,795 --> 00:08:59,564
{\an1}These times are tough.

101
00:08:59,597 --> 00:09:02,533
{\an1}We barely have enough
for ourselves right now.

102
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:03,935
I'm very sorry.

103
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:04,969
{\an1}Try somewhere else.

104
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,778
{\an1}-But this was my last stop.

105
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:40,637
Let's go.

106
00:09:57,554 --> 00:10:00,490
[whimpering]

107
00:10:08,064 --> 00:10:10,500
{\an1}YOUNG NAGATO (VOICEOVER):
I can't go any farther.

108
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:12,401
{\an1}Am I going to die here?

109
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:23,780
-Go on.

110
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:27,284
Eat this.

111
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:28,784
-Really?

112
00:10:28,817 --> 00:10:29,286
-Mm-hm.

113
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:46,168
[whimpering]

114
00:10:52,641 --> 00:10:53,609
-Here.

115
00:10:53,642 --> 00:10:55,077
But eat slowly.

116
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,223
-Konan, who are
these two, anyway?

117
00:11:08,257 --> 00:11:11,626
{\an1}-Sorry, but he was almost dead.

118
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:14,562
{\an1}-And a dog, to boot?

119
00:11:14,595 --> 00:11:16,631
{\an1}What's your name?

120
00:11:16,664 --> 00:11:18,033
-Chibi.

121
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:20,135
-Boy, you sure
have a weird name.

122
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:21,203
Chibi?

123
00:11:21,236 --> 00:11:23,038
-Not me.

124
00:11:23,072 --> 00:11:25,441
{\an1}That's the dog's name.

125
00:11:25,473 --> 00:11:27,242
{\an1}-And that's how we met.

126
00:11:27,276 --> 00:11:31,779
{\an1}How I was introduced to Konan,
and also to a boy named Yahiko.

127
00:11:31,813 --> 00:11:36,218
{\an1}They were war orphans just like
I was, but they were strong,

128
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:39,053
{\an1}and they were fighting
desperately to stay alive.

129
00:11:39,087 --> 00:11:45,860
{\an1}And so, with nowhere else
to turn, I joined them.

130
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:46,995
-Wow.

131
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:48,930
{\an1}There's so much food here.

132
00:11:48,963 --> 00:11:50,698
-If you're gonna
stay with us, then I

133
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:53,701
{\an1}expect you to help find
provisions too, small fry.

134
00:11:53,735 --> 00:11:55,203
-OK.

135
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:56,671
But how?

136
00:11:56,704 --> 00:11:57,537
-We steal.

137
00:11:57,571 --> 00:11:59,240
{\an1}YOUNG NAGATO: You steal?

138
00:11:59,273 --> 00:12:00,808
{\an1}But isn't that wrong?

139
00:12:00,842 --> 00:12:02,509
{\an1}-Don't be ridiculous.

140
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:03,745
{\an1}These are hard times.

141
00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:07,115
{\an1}We gotta fend for ourselves
by any means necessary.

142
00:12:07,148 --> 00:12:09,417
{\an1}Naive ideals won't cut it.

143
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,885
{\an1}-No, you're right.

144
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,326
{\an1}-We'll do whatever
it takes to live,

145
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,361
{\an1}even if that means
we have to steal.

146
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:23,830
Got it?

147
00:12:23,864 --> 00:12:24,798
-I understand.

148
00:12:29,404 --> 00:12:31,339
{\an1}Could you please give
us some food, sir?

149
00:12:31,372 --> 00:12:33,140
{\an1}-Just a little will do.

150
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:34,475
{\an1}-Please help us out.

151
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:36,810
{\an1}-I'm not just gonna
hand out fish for free.

152
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:37,377
Go on, scram.

153
00:12:37,412 --> 00:12:38,513
-Stingy bastard.

154
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:40,647
{\an1}-Hey, you, watch your
tongue, you rotten brat.

155
00:12:45,152 --> 00:12:47,888
-Wha-- Hey, you.

156
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:49,456
{\an1}Come back here, you mutt!

157
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:50,390
Stop!

158
00:12:50,424 --> 00:12:52,759
{\an1}That's just great.

159
00:12:52,793 --> 00:12:53,260
Hey!

160
00:12:53,293 --> 00:12:55,162
Drop that!

161
00:12:55,195 --> 00:12:56,196
You kids.

162
00:12:56,229 --> 00:12:58,631
I'll find out!

163
00:12:58,664 --> 00:13:00,300
-Good dog.

164
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,535
-Score.

165
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,669
{\an1}-If you're not buying,
then get out of here.

166
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,275
-Ow.

167
00:13:08,308 --> 00:13:09,008
Uh oh.

168
00:13:11,944 --> 00:13:13,879
-Ignorant kids.

169
00:13:13,913 --> 00:13:16,982
{\an1}And next time, you're not
gonna get off so easily.

170
00:13:17,016 --> 00:13:17,484
Hmph.

171
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,992
{\an1}NAGATO: There was no
system for helping orphans

172
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:30,029
in that small,
chaos-ridden nation.

173
00:13:30,062 --> 00:13:33,099
{\an1}Thievery became the only
way for us to survive.

174
00:13:33,132 --> 00:13:35,201
{\an1}We had no other choice.

175
00:13:35,234 --> 00:13:38,204
{\an1}But even under such
harsh circumstances,

176
00:13:38,237 --> 00:13:39,738
{\an1}Yahiko never abandoned hope.

177
00:13:46,711 --> 00:13:48,314
{\an1}Yahiko was always optimistic.

178
00:13:51,283 --> 00:13:52,585
-You guys OK?

179
00:13:52,617 --> 00:13:54,220
{\an1}Listen, don't feel
too bad, all right?

180
00:13:54,253 --> 00:13:56,489
{\an1}These things just
sometimes happen.

181
00:13:56,522 --> 00:13:58,390
NAGATO: I guess.

182
00:13:58,424 --> 00:13:59,592
-Nagato.

183
00:13:59,624 --> 00:14:00,259
Tell me.

184
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:01,693
{\an1}Do you have any dreams?

185
00:14:01,726 --> 00:14:03,761
-A dream?

186
00:14:03,795 --> 00:14:06,998
{\an1}-Sure not gonna live in
a dump like this forever.

187
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:09,167
I got big dreams
to make come true.

188
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,437
-Huh?

189
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,938
{\an1}-World domination!

190
00:14:13,972 --> 00:14:15,173
{\an1}-World domination?

191
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:15,673
What?

192
00:14:15,707 --> 00:14:16,542
Seriously?

193
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,809
{\an1}-You better believe it.

194
00:14:17,842 --> 00:14:19,744
Once I rule the
world, we'll never

195
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:22,847
{\an1}have to go through this
kind of suffering again.

196
00:14:22,881 --> 00:14:24,749
{\an1}-Yeah, that'd be nice.

197
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:27,752
{\an1}-And, if I die like this without
trying to reach my goals,

198
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:30,889
{\an1}then my mom and dad's soul
will never rest in peace.

199
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:32,223
{\an1}Ain't that right, Konan?

200
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:33,625
-Mm-hm.

201
00:14:33,657 --> 00:14:36,660
{\an1}-If we rule the world, then we
can do whatever we want to do.

202
00:14:36,693 --> 00:14:38,029
{\an1}-You know, you're right.

203
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:41,166
{\an1}It'd be just like
we were all gods.

204
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,600
{\an1}Think we could get
rid of war, too?

205
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:52,277
-Everyone OK?

206
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,718
Dammit.

207
00:15:01,752 --> 00:15:02,252
Not now.

208
00:15:08,225 --> 00:15:13,163
{\an1}-Battling shinobi
right on top of us.

209
00:15:13,197 --> 00:15:17,267
{\an1}Hanzo against Hidden Leaf ninja.

210
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:19,803
{\an1}-It was Jiraiya-sensei
and his two teammates

211
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,072
{\an1}that were fighting.

212
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:24,875
{\an1}The three who would become
known as the legendary Sannin

213
00:15:24,908 --> 00:15:26,810
of the Leaf.

214
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:30,647
{\an1}Their opponent was Hanzo,
leader of the Hidden Rain.

215
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:35,085
The battle was
extremely intense, and--

216
00:15:35,118 --> 00:15:37,554
{\an1}YOUNG NAGATO: Chibi!

217
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:40,490
Chibi!

218
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,693
{\an1}-Yahiko, what do we do?

219
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:44,261
{\an1}Chibi's not breathing.

220
00:15:44,294 --> 00:15:45,895
{\an1}-Worry about him later.

221
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:47,197
{\an1}We gotta get out of here, fast.

222
00:15:52,436 --> 00:15:52,902
-Chibi.

223
00:15:59,075 --> 00:16:00,009
-Damn it.

224
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,713
{\an1}Damn it, damn it.

225
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:04,313
Damn it!

226
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:07,984
{\an1}Why is it always like this?

227
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:12,121
{\an1}If all of this useless
fighting doesn't stop,

228
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:16,325
{\an1}then I'll become the god of
this world and make it stop.

229
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:20,463
{\an1}NAGATO: That's when Yahiko's
dream became my dream.

230
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:29,138
-Nagato.

231
00:16:29,171 --> 00:16:31,741
{\an1}Quit crying all the time.

232
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:33,942
{\an1}If you only cry when
you're beaten down,

233
00:16:33,975 --> 00:16:35,777
{\an1}then nothing will change.

234
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,779
{\an1}Just like this nation.

235
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:40,081
But I'm going to
change this nation.

236
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:41,983
{\an1}And for that, I will need power.

237
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:42,817
Not just words.

238
00:16:45,454 --> 00:16:47,590
{\an1}-What kind of power?

239
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,592
{\an1}-We're going to learn ninjutsu.

240
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,058
-Ninjutsu?

241
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:52,394
From who?

242
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:57,600
{\an1}-The Hidden Leaf ninja who
were fighting against Hanzo.

243
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:59,968
{\an1}I just checked out
the battle site.

244
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:02,404
{\an1}I didn't see a single
one of their corpses.

245
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:05,473
{\an1}They all went up against
Hanzo, and they survived it.

246
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:08,977
{\an1}Those guys must be
incredibly powerful.

247
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,544
-Maybe.

248
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,523
I hate Hanzo.

249
00:17:21,556 --> 00:17:23,824
{\an1}He's made the entire Hidden
Rain village into a warzone.

250
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:30,665
{\an1}Anyway, I'm going to
become their student.

251
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:31,832
{\an1}I've got to find them.

252
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:33,768
{\an1}-But what if you go after
them and you find out

253
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,270
{\an1}they've been killed?

254
00:17:36,303 --> 00:17:37,871
-Then I'll find
whoever did them in

255
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:40,274
and become their
student instead.

256
00:17:40,307 --> 00:17:43,377
{\an1}My mind is made up.

257
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,213
{\an1}Take only non-perishable foods.

258
00:17:46,246 --> 00:17:47,581
{\an1}-Just toss the rest?

259
00:17:47,615 --> 00:17:48,082
-No.

00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:54,421
-Chibi.

261
00:17:54,455 --> 00:17:55,622
Rest in peace.

262
00:18:05,532 --> 00:18:07,468
{\an1}-What are you kids doing here?

263
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:09,236
{\an1}-All this stuff is
for you to share

264
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:11,572
{\an1}with the grocer and
the fruit stand lady.

265
00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:16,042
{\an1}I figure, in some
ways, we owe you guys.

266
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:19,011
{\an1}Anyway, take care.

267
00:18:19,045 --> 00:18:19,680
-We're sorry.

-What the--

269
00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:26,520
NAGATO: However,
we soon discovered

270
00:18:26,553 --> 00:18:29,656
{\an1}that pursuing the Leaf's
Sannin was far from simple,

271
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,492
{\an1}and was very dangerous.

272
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:34,894
{\an1}Following ninja meant going
deep into the battle zone.

273

Even though we
were just kids, we

274
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:39,132
{\an1}had no choice but
to throw ourselves

How cool am I?

TOGETHER: Right.

287

{\an1}NAGATO: No respectable ninja
would ever leave tracks behind,

288
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:35,720
{\an1}so the Leaf's Sannin
were not easy to find.

the intensity of the fighting,

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,203
{\an1}the more likely we'd
find the Leaf's Sannin.
