{\an1}Nagato! Nagato, just hang on!

152
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:28,839
{\an8}<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>Why.... why did this happen?</i>

153
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,352
{\an1}did this?!  Was it you?!

154
00:14:41,384 --> 00:14:45,222
{\an1}Was this attack...?!  Are you
responsible for this?!

155
00:14:45,256 --> 00:14:51,194
{\an1}No... But... we found
this in the village.

156
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:02,305
What is this?!

157
00:15:02,338 --> 00:15:10,478
{\an1}That's a special kunai that the
Hidden Leaf's Hokage uses for
his Flying Raijin Jutsu.

158
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:14,850
{\an1}You mean, the Hokage
of... the Hidden Leaf!?!

159
00:15:14,883 --> 00:15:18,020
You're saying... that
the Hokage was the one
who ordered this?!

160
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:20,488
<i>(Hiruko)</i>
<i>Yeah, probably.  </i>

161
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:25,026
{\an1}<i>For the Hidden Leaf, this was an</i>
<i>embarrassing and disgraceful</i>
<i>incident...</i>

162
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:29,864
{\an1}<i>They probably wanted it to look</i>
<i>like it never happened.</i>

163
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:38,406
[screaming] I'll
never forgive him!

164
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:45,412
{\an1}rom then on, Nagato and Konan
stopped referring to themselves
as Team Jiraiya.

165
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,915
{\an1}So in other words, what you're
telling us is, that this was the

166
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:53,253
{\an1}day that triggered their
yearning to get revenge on the
Hidden Leaf Village.

167
00:15:53,286 --> 00:16:01,327
{\an1}Yeah... What provides the
greatest motivation for
humans is revenge.

168
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,864
{\an1}By the way, what's going to
happen once the Akatsuki
strengthens its military power?

169
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:09,567
{\an1}Beats me... You'd have to
ask the guys up top.

170
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:17,474
{\an4}Well, if there's anyone they
want dead down the road,  I'll
be more than happy to blow them
up with my art, believe me!

171
00:16:17,507 --> 00:16:20,378
{\an1}Things will start happening in
the very near future.

172
00:16:20,411 --> 00:16:25,083
{\an1}So for now, let's
just wait and see.

173
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:42,432
{\an5}(Tendo Pain)
People of the Leaf... You will
feel the same pain that I have
experienced.

174
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:48,704
{\an1}Unless you know the same pain,
you can never really understand
what others have felt.

175
00:16:53,342 --> 00:16:57,380
{\an1}May pain befall the
great nation!

176
