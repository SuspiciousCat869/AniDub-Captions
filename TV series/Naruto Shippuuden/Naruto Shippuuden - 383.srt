1
00:01:50,571 --> 00:01:52,772
{\an1}It is true that our nations
have never gotten

2
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:54,508
{\an1}along in the past.

3
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,909
{\an1}But we each did what we
had to do to protect our

4
00:01:56,943 --> 00:01:58,844
{\an1}brethren and our clans.

5
00:01:59,512 --> 00:02:02,081
{\an1}Perhaps at times we
had no other choice.

6
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:05,016
{\an1}And now, today, even
if our Five Nation

7
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,818
{\an1}Treaty comes to be.

8
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:09,920
{\an1}I honestly can't say how
long it will last or even

9
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:11,556
{\an1}if we can hold onto it.

10
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,227
{\an1}But I've got this dream that
at some time in the future

11
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,564
{\an1}there will come a day when
shinobi will collaborate,

12
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,333
{\an1}and help each other, with
one heart, regardless

13
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:24,901
{\an1}of their affiliation.

14
00:02:25,268 --> 00:02:28,571
That is my dream
of the future.

15
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:34,343
{\an1}Seems like our generation no
longer needs to talk about

16
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:37,112
{\an1}that dream, 'cause
it's happening right now.

17
00:02:37,145 --> 00:02:39,348
Am I wrong?

18
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:40,716
No, you're not.

19
00:02:40,748 --> 00:02:42,783
{\an1}That goes without saying.

20
00:02:42,817 --> 00:02:44,352
However...

21
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,788
{\an1}If we don't win here,
then it won't come to be!

22
00:02:48,822 --> 00:02:51,191
{\an1}The Tsuchikage is correct.

23
00:02:51,224 --> 00:02:53,426
{\an1}Defeat is not an option.

24
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,461
All right!

25
00:02:54,494 --> 00:02:56,895
{\an1}Let's spread out and
take command, then!

26
00:02:56,929 --> 00:02:59,498
{\an1}We'll draw out the
Allied Shinobi Forces'

27
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:01,200
greatest power!

28
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:04,902
{\an1}For that is our primary
duty as the Five Kage!

29
00:03:05,704 --> 00:03:06,804
Now go!

30
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:37,065
[attacking yell]

31
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:45,205
Sasuke!

32
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:46,740
I'll synch up!

33
00:03:56,114 --> 00:03:57,283
Incredible...

34
00:03:57,317 --> 00:03:58,984
{\an1}But what just happened?

35
00:03:59,017 --> 00:04:01,820
{\an1}Naruto and Sasuke
are attacking as one.

36
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,888
Did they do it?!

37
00:04:33,214 --> 00:04:34,750
{\an1}You better be prepared.

38
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:40,621
I'll never let
my comrades die!

39
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,222
{\an1}No matter what happens!

40
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:55,701
This is!

41
00:04:59,304 --> 00:05:00,505
Naruto!

42
00:05:06,043 --> 00:05:09,880
{\an1}Even while you fight, you're
also healing your comrades.

43
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,051
Naruto!

44
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:17,621
{\an1}Just focus on what
only you can do!

45
00:05:17,654 --> 00:05:19,355
{\an1}Leave the healing to me!

46
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,425
You don't
understand, Sakura.

47
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,327
He's doing this
unconsciously.

48
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,695
Huh?

49
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:28,330
{\an1}His chakra is acting on its
own, merely from his deep

50
00:05:28,363 --> 00:05:30,098
{\an1}desire to help Shikamaru.

51
00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:33,968
{\an1}With my Mind Transmission
Jutsu I can sense it!

52
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,175
Damn it, Naruto.

53
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,445
{\an1}You're always going
above and beyond, always

54
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,913
{\an1}sticking your neck out.

55
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,251
You'll go to any
length for us.

56
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,654
{\an1}Since before the war,
you've never held back or

57
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:58,824
compromised when
it came to us.

58
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:05,029
{\an1}You even made me get off my
butt and stop being lazy.

59
00:06:06,063 --> 00:06:07,365
What a drag...

60
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:14,271
I'm sorry, Dad.

61
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,643
{\an1}Naruto doesn't want
me to join you yet.

62
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:21,878
Shikamaru, stop
talking right now!

63
00:06:21,912 --> 00:06:24,346
I am not going
to let you die!

64
00:06:26,014 --> 00:06:27,048
Naruto!

65
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:29,350
No, everybody
needs you!

66
00:06:34,054 --> 00:06:34,923
Dad...

67
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:39,159
{\an1}I only found out later
that Naruto had persevered

68
00:06:39,193 --> 00:06:41,060
through a ton of
painful and bitter

69
00:06:41,094 --> 00:06:43,530
{\an1}things all on his own.

70
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:49,368
{\an1}And I don't want him
to ever have to go

71
00:06:49,402 --> 00:06:50,969
{\an1}through that again.

72
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:54,606
{\an1}Or at least that's
how I feel when I'm

73
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,541
{\an1}hanging around him.

74
00:07:00,144 --> 00:07:01,513
I told you once.

75
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:04,215
Remember, Dad?

76
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,918
{\an1}He's going to become a
very important shinobi

77
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:09,487
{\an1}for this village someday.

78
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:11,722
I'm sure of it.

79
00:07:12,021 --> 00:07:13,523
{\an1}When I'm with Naruto.

80
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:15,592
{\an1}He makes me want to
follow him to walk by

81
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,761
{\an1}his side no matter what.

82
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:27,736
{\an1}Unlike Lord First, that
dumb Naruto doesn't have

83
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:31,772
{\an1}an adept brother like Lord
Second to be his advisor.

84
00:07:33,808 --> 00:07:35,141
Well, then...

85
00:07:35,175 --> 00:07:41,248
{\an1}That's why, even more so,
I need to stick around

86
00:07:41,281 --> 00:07:44,918
{\an1}so that I can stand
next to that idiot when

87
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:47,086
{\an1}he becomes Hokage.

88
00:07:50,356 --> 00:07:51,724
{\an1}So I'm sorry, Dad.

89
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,896
{\an1}I'm afraid I can't join you
on the other side just yet...

90
00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:59,564
{\an1}Because there's no one
more qualified than

91
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:02,534
{\an1}me to be Naruto's advisor.

92
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:06,503
[chuckle]

93
00:08:08,472 --> 00:08:09,873
{\an1}Thank you, Naruto!

94
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:13,977
{\an1}Your chakra, as well
as the power of your

95
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:15,478
heart saved him!

96
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:18,381
He's back!

97
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:20,750
{\an1}Thank you, Sakura.

98
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:22,717
{\an1}And thank you, Naruto.

99
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,120
Don't go
overboard, Shikamaru.

100
00:08:26,154 --> 00:08:28,355
{\an1}You just might become
my advisor instead!

101
00:08:29,456 --> 00:08:30,659
[anxious whine]

102
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:33,093
{\an1}No need to fret, Akamaru.

103
00:08:33,127 --> 00:08:36,095
{\an1}That's because a Kage can
have up to three advisors.

104
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:40,199
I want to stand
beside Naruto, too.

105
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:42,135
{\an1}I'll have to work hard!

106
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:44,537
Shikamaru!

107
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,378
Lady Tsunade!

108
00:08:56,347 --> 00:08:57,548
You did well!

109
00:09:03,054 --> 00:09:04,989
{\an1}Forgive me, Grandfather.

110
00:09:06,356 --> 00:09:08,191
{\an1}Don't apologize, Tsuna.

111
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,495
{\an1}I dragged this mess into
my grandchildren's era.

112
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:16,098
{\an1}My cowardice is to blame.

113
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:20,402
{\an1}However, your heart and
your dreams have been passed

114
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:24,739
{\an1}down even beyond your
grandchildren's era!

115
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:26,841
Yes...

116
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:28,910
{\an1}...your Will of Fire!

117
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,980
[attacking yell]

118
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:36,516
{\an1}You get back here!

119
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:39,820
All right!

120
00:09:39,853 --> 00:09:42,089
{\an1}Now let's get this giant
tree cut down while he's

121
00:09:42,121 --> 00:09:44,056
{\an1}distracted by his battle!

122
00:09:48,526 --> 00:09:51,796
{\an1}No matter how tall or thick
this tree may be, it's still

123
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:55,667
{\an1}quite tiny compared to
the great earth itself!

124
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,004
{\an1}And this earth, this
entire land is on our side!

125
00:09:59,837 --> 00:10:01,772
[eager yell]

126
00:10:05,274 --> 00:10:06,677
{\an1}Look, I'm begging you!

127
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,411
{\an1}I don't want us taking
each other down for

128
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:10,380
{\an1}vengeance anymore!

129
00:10:10,747 --> 00:10:13,382
{\an1}Shinobi shouldn't lower
their heads so easily!

130
00:10:13,415 --> 00:10:15,150
{\an1}Action and power are
the things that a

131
00:10:15,183 --> 00:10:17,252
{\an1}shinobi should respect!

132
00:10:20,856 --> 00:10:22,724
{\an1}It seems those who
become Hokage like

133
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:24,960
{\an1}prostrating themselves.

134
00:10:24,993 --> 00:10:28,295
{\an1}But as an act that relays
one's heart, perhaps it can

135
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:31,632
{\an1}lead to strength and
be meritorious, too.

136
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,901
{\an1}Let's go, everyone!

137
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,236
Okay!

138
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,170
That means it's
Double Lariat time,

139
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:39,906
brother of mine!

140
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,575
{\an1}As a woman, I mustn't
start late on battle like

141
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,310
{\an1}I have with marriage!

142
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,545
All right, then!

143
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:47,946
Let's move out!

Come on!

Naruto...

148
00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:16,038
{\an1}You have truly become a
necessary existence

149

to this world.

150

{\an1}What the two of us
always wanted to be.

151
00:11:21,576 --> 00:11:24,746
{\an1}And you shall now
save the whole world.

152
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,848
{\an1}Follow me, everyone!

00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:41,460
This should do.

155
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,361
{\an1}I should get going now.

156

{\an1}The springtime of my youth
has not faded just yet!

00:11:53,537 --> 00:11:56,340
{\an1}Your past is filtering
into me through the others.

160
00:11:59,643 --> 00:12:02,545
{\an1}Naruto Uzumaki, you are
the one who is uniting

161
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:03,847
{\an1}everyone right now.

162
00:12:04,714 --> 00:12:08,818
{\an1}Your tempestuous history
made you who you are.

163
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:11,954
{\an1}And your way of life
has brought hope into

164
00:12:11,987 --> 00:12:13,388
{\an1}everyone's hearts!

165
00:12:17,126 --> 00:12:18,326
For our future!

166
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:19,360
Come on!

167
00:12:19,393 --> 00:12:21,130
[cheering]

168
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:31,571
Let's go!

169
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,615
Let's cut down
that giant tree!

170
00:12:46,985 --> 00:12:48,887
{\an1}Samurai, do not waver!

171
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,188
Now go forth!

172
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,925
{\an1}We should go, too.

173
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,794
Are you okay,
though, Shikamaru?

174
00:12:56,827 --> 00:12:57,861
Yeah.

175
00:12:57,895 --> 00:12:59,963
Don't worry, I'm
completely recovered now.

176
00:12:59,997 --> 00:13:01,899
{\an1}But what if that tree
tries to rob us of

177
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:03,299
{\an1}our chakra again?

178
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:05,101
{\an1}Now we know, we'll
just be careful.

179
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:11,606
{\an1}Listen, Fourth, I'm
going to use the link

180
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,409
{\an1}between your chakra
and Naruto's chakra.

181
00:13:14,442 --> 00:13:18,079
{\an1}I can't move everyone
simultaneously like you, but

182
00:13:18,113 --> 00:13:20,714
{\an1}I'll protect them with
my Teleportation Jutsu.

183
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:24,652
Orochimaru...

184
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:26,754
{\an1}Are you just going
to be a spectator?

185
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:32,058
{\an1}I have no interest
in this war at all.

186
00:13:34,493 --> 00:13:38,198
{\an1}But, this dream Obito's
pursuing would ultimately

187
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:41,400
{\an1}lead to the elimination of
all of this, my precious

188
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:45,838
{\an1}laboratory, so I suppose
that I cannot support it.

189
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:49,140
{\an1}Well, then lend a hand!

190
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:53,177
{\an1}All right, I shall.

191
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:56,713
{\an1}I'll revel just a bit in
nostalgic memories

192
00:13:56,746 --> 00:14:00,750
and in some
student-teacher partnership!

193
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:06,388
I'll shift to a
more offensive form!

194
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,559
What is it?!

195
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:13,262
Don't panic!

196
00:14:13,295 --> 00:14:14,230
It's coming!

197
00:14:21,969 --> 00:14:24,239
{\an1}I'll teleport away
those who seem in danger.

198
00:14:24,605 --> 00:14:26,573
{\an1}So go forth without fear!

199
00:14:27,274 --> 00:14:28,674
It's the voice
of Lord Second!

200
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,810
We can give it
our all, then.

201
00:14:31,178 --> 00:14:33,446
{\an1}-That's because--
-But still, don't get

202
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:35,014
{\an1}careless, all right?

203
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:37,515
{\an1}With two 100 Healings
adepts, we can likely summon

204
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:40,418
{\an1}a tenth of Katsuyu's
actual body here from

205
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:41,987
Shikkotsu Woods!

206
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,623
{\an1}We'll mold her into the
Allied Force's footing, a

207
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:47,092
{\an1}Healing Area where one
can be restored just

208
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,859
{\an1}by standing on her.

209
00:14:48,893 --> 00:14:50,794
{\an1}Are you ready, Sakura?

210
00:14:50,828 --> 00:14:51,896
Yes!

211
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:54,731
Summoning Jutsu!

212
00:14:59,836 --> 00:15:00,670
Ino!

213
00:15:00,703 --> 00:15:01,905
{\an1}Have you told everyone?

214
00:15:01,938 --> 00:15:03,373
Yes!

215
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:08,510
Huh?

216
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,945
{\an1}What is that going to do?!

217
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:10,879
Is this it?!

218
00:15:10,913 --> 00:15:12,114
This way, we can
fight without our

219
00:15:12,147 --> 00:15:13,714
{\an1}chakra being stolen!

220
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,750
{\an1}Oh, this is simply great!

221
00:15:16,117 --> 00:15:17,718
So this is the
Healing Area?!

222
00:15:17,752 --> 00:15:19,452
{\an1}Now that you get it,
quit playing around

223
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:20,755
and get going!

224
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,394
Where's Naruto?

225
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,068
{\an1}Damn it, he really is fast!

226
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:41,073
{\an1}But I'm starting to
sense him better and better!

227
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:44,642
Right there!

228
00:15:53,183 --> 00:15:55,651
It's about time
for you to sleep.

229
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:00,890
Now I'll guide
you into the dream.

230
00:16:03,793 --> 00:16:06,195
{\an1}There's no time left!

231
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:26,879
Obito...

232
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,117
{\an1}I bet that you really
did want to confirm...

233
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,125
[roar]

234
00:16:43,428 --> 00:16:46,063
{\an1}...whether a heart that
never bends and a Will of

235
00:16:46,097 --> 00:16:49,200
{\an1}Fire that does not
waver, no matter what,

236
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:51,268
{\an1}are truly possible.

237
00:16:55,571 --> 00:16:57,040
{\an1}You gave up on them once...

238
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:01,210
{\an1}But after fighting Naruto
and hearing his words.

239
00:17:01,243 --> 00:17:04,680
{\an1}I think you've stopped being
able to deny, deep down,

240
00:17:04,713 --> 00:17:08,150
that they might
really exist after all.

241
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,952
{\an1}Isn't that right, Obito?

242
00:17:13,921 --> 00:17:17,891
{\an1}And yet you still search and
test everyone and everything

243
00:17:17,924 --> 00:17:21,361
in an attempt to
prove yourself wrong.

244
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:26,599
{\an1}Which is why even
now, as you stand

245
00:17:26,632 --> 00:17:28,534
{\an1}at the precipice.

246
00:17:47,184 --> 00:17:48,551
What's that?!

247
00:17:51,954 --> 00:17:54,924
[screaming]

248
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,765
{\an1}What happened just now?!

249
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,434
{\an1}Naruto and Sasuke are--!

250
00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:08,969
Wait!

251
00:18:32,757 --> 00:18:36,727
{\an1}You keep pushing Naruto,
trying to get your answer.

252
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,202
{\an1}Why do you get up?!

253
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:48,605
{\an1}And what exactly are you
fighting for, anyway?!

254
00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:51,308
{\an1}For your comrades?

255
00:18:51,807 --> 00:18:54,076
Or do you fight
for this world?

256
00:18:59,814 --> 00:19:00,849
Listen...

257
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,152
Comrades
eventually betray you.

258
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:09,390
And this world
transforms love into hatred.

259
00:19:10,158 --> 00:19:11,493
You should know!

260
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:13,060
{\an1}You've experienced it!

261
00:19:14,828 --> 00:19:16,964
{\an1}The people of the Leaf
and Sasuke betrayed

262
00:19:16,997 --> 00:19:18,265
{\an1}you in the past...

263
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:25,304
{\an1}...and Jiraiya's love
conferred hate upon you.

264
00:19:30,476 --> 00:19:33,145
{\an1}You and I are both the same.

265
00:19:34,412 --> 00:19:37,648
{\an1}Cumulating anguish and pain
will change you in time.

266
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:41,585
{\an1}And very soon, even
more pain and suffering

267
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:43,087
{\an1}shall assault you.

268
00:19:44,355 --> 00:19:47,790
{\an1}How can you claim you will
never change because of it?!

269
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:52,996
{\an1}You don't know when comrades
might betray you again.

270
00:19:54,197 --> 00:19:56,031
Or if the Allied
Forces will go back to

271
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:57,666
{\an1}fighting each other.

272
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,936
{\an1}You don't even know if you
can defeat me right now!

273
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:04,739
{\an1}There should be no
reason to keep fighting

274
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:06,741
{\an1}for a world like this.

275
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:14,114
{\an1}No matter, it's coming to
an end in a few minutes.

276
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:18,618
So why do you
keep on fighting?!

277
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,996
{\an1}Because it's my Ninja Way.

278
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:39,337
{\an1}No matter what, I
never go back on my word!

279
00:20:39,903 --> 00:20:42,639
{\an1}That is and always
will be my Ninja Way.

280
00:20:51,113 --> 00:20:54,283
I thought I told
you to go to sleep.

281
00:20:59,622 --> 00:21:02,290
{\an1}Let's end it with
our next move, Naruto.

282
00:21:02,324 --> 00:21:03,024
Yeah!

283
00:21:16,002 --> 00:21:19,871
{\an1}We'll sleep tomorrow and
we'll dream our own dreams!

284
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,861
{\an1}<i>Obito, when people see</i>
<i>someone trying twice as hard</i>

285
00:23:00,895 --> 00:23:02,798
<i>as others, they</i>
<i>instinctively start</i>

286
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,099
{\an1}<i>wanting to lend a hand.</i>

287
00:23:05,132 --> 00:23:08,168
{\an1}<i>That's because people</i>
<i>eventually learn that they</i>

288
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:11,304
{\an1}<i>only have each other to fill</i>
<i>the holes in their hearts.</i>

289
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:15,542
{\an1}<i>And he who possesses a heart</i>
<i>filled with comrades...</i>

290
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:20,379
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "A Heart Filled</i>
<i>with Comrades."</i>

291
00:23:20,412 --> 00:23:23,115
{\an1}<i>...is truly powerful!</i>
