1
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:35,501
-Why are you-- why
can't you understand?

2
00:00:42,747 --> 00:00:45,385
He'll take your body, Sasuke!

3
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:46,421
It's Orochimaru!

4
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,791
He's just using you!

5
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:53,668
-If it happens, it happens.

6
00:00:53,702 --> 00:00:54,637
So be it.

7
00:00:58,578 --> 00:01:02,719
You're still such
a child, Naruto.

8
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:09,098
I don't care what happens to me,
or anyone else in this world.

9
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:15,210
So long as I can get my
revenge, nothing else matters.

10
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:18,482
To be honest, neither
Orochimaru nor I

11
00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:20,719
am strong enough to
defeat Itachi alone.

12
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,668
But if I can obtain the power to
defeat Itachi by giving myself

13
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:35,147
to Orochimaru, I'll give him
my life a thousand times over.

14
00:01:43,263 --> 00:01:44,532
[theme music]

15
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:51,773
YAMATO: Enough talk.

16
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,879
Naruto, Sakura, out
of consideration

17
00:03:54,913 --> 00:03:57,952
for the two of you, I haven't
taken any drastic measures

18
00:03:58,185 --> 00:04:01,325
against Sasuke, but I'm sorry.

19
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:03,897
I can't hold back anymore.

20
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,898
-Captain Yamato.

21
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:08,805
-What do you plan on doing?

22
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:10,608
YAMATO: He's a rogue shinobi.

23
00:04:10,642 --> 00:04:12,512
No different than Orochimaru.

24
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:15,317
He can't be allowed
to roam free.

25
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:21,663
We're bringing him back to the
Leaf by any means necessary.

26
00:04:21,663 --> 00:04:24,234
-The Leaf Village?

27
00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:25,838
I'm done with the lot of you.

28
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:34,788
It's over.

29
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:46,544
-Orochimaru.

30
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,015
-I wouldn't bother
with that jutsu.

31
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:50,985
Be smart now.

32
00:04:51,018 --> 00:04:51,987
-Let go.

33
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:58,967
-Now, now.

34
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:00,770
I'm not going to tell you again.

35
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:02,406
Watch your tone with
Lord Orochimaru.

36
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:14,464
-Give me a reason to stop.

37
00:05:14,497 --> 00:05:17,869
-You do remember the Akatsuki
are on the move now, don't you?

38
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:24,583
We want the good people of the
Leaf Village to get rid of them

39
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,986
for us.

40
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:28,424
As many of them as possible.

41
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:34,300
If the other Akatsuki
interfere, you

42
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:38,375
might not get your
precious revenge.

43
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:40,913
-That's a pitiful excuse.

44
00:05:40,946 --> 00:05:44,052
-But if it helps your chances
by even one small percent then

45
00:05:44,286 --> 00:05:46,725
it's worth it.

46
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:47,325
Agreed?

47
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:07,730
-We're leaving.

48
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:39,839
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I-- I
couldn't stop him again.

49
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:48,689
I-- I'm so weak.

50

[sobbing]

51
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:21,552
SAKURA: Naruto, crying
won't bring Sasuke back.

52
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:31,002
I'm here too.

53
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:32,472
We have to be strong.

54
00:08:32,505 --> 00:08:33,140
You and me together.

55
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:42,858
-Well, look.

56
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:45,865
We've still got almost
half a year left.

57
00:08:45,898 --> 00:08:47,934
And three makes for
better odds than two.

58
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,909
You've got me.

59
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:53,179
That should be some help, right?

60
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:12,882
NARUTO: Thanks.

61
00:09:20,063 --> 00:09:21,899
-Now then.

62
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:23,802
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): The
fight has just begun.

63
00:09:50,516 --> 00:09:53,255
-Oink

64
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:54,157
-I see then.

65
00:10:21,408 --> 00:10:22,977
-What?

66
00:10:22,977 --> 00:10:25,148
They fought with Sasuke?

67
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:26,550
-Yeah.

68
00:10:26,784 --> 00:10:30,125
-But their original
mission was--

69
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,394
-I know.

70
00:10:31,427 --> 00:10:36,837
The mission that they were given
was to capture Sasori's spy,

71
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,977
and bring him back to the
Leaf, hopefully gathering

72
00:10:39,977 --> 00:10:44,552
intel on Orochimaru and
Sasuke while they were at it.

73
00:10:44,787 --> 00:10:48,961
However, Kabuto Yakushi
turned out to be the spy,

74
00:10:48,994 --> 00:10:53,169
and had already been
freed from Sasori's jutsu.

75
00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:56,007
It seems Orochimaru meant
to use their meeting

76
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,946
as a means of taking
Sasori out, not

77
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,986
knowing that he had
already been killed.

78
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:05,425
Naruto confronted him, losing
control of his emotions,

79
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,863
and unfortunately ran amok.

80
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:13,507
As soon as that
fourth tail appeared,

81
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,412
everything went
straight to hell.

82
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:19,819
Orochimaru went head to head
with him in his Nine-Tails

83
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:23,025
form, and was probably
pushed to his limits,

84
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:25,029
because he vanished
while Yamato was

85
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:28,168
busy getting Naruto
under control.

86
00:11:28,168 --> 00:11:31,908
Yamato managed to have a
clone tail them though.

87
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,014
They eventually located
Orochimaru's hideout,

88
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:38,387
and made their way inside.

89
00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:41,560
That's when they ran into
Sasuke, and the battle ensued.

90
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,877
-So, what happened?

91
00:11:56,054 --> 00:11:59,961
-Sasuke is significantly
more powerful now.

92
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:04,571
JIRAIYA: Naruto was
apparently no match for him.

93
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:06,507
-I see.

94
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,544
-Ah, don't let it
get you too down.

95
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:11,450
He couldn't use his full power
because of all the damage

96
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:14,623
he took from morphing
into the Nine-Tails.

97
00:12:14,623 --> 00:12:15,591
-Oh no.

98
00:12:15,624 --> 00:12:18,865
That's not the part
that worries me.

99
00:12:18,898 --> 00:12:21,569
I figured Sasuke would be
stronger at this point.

100
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:25,510
I just-- Now that
Naruto has realized

101
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:32,122
how far ahead Sasuke is, he'll
be hungry for more training.

102
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:34,493
Know what I mean?

103
00:12:34,527 --> 00:12:36,632
-Oh yeah.

104
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:40,238
-Anyway, we should just be glad
they came home in one piece.

105
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:51,960
-It's very fortunate
that Naruto was

106
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,031
able to make it back safely.

107
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:57,137
-All the same, we
should never have

108
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,975
risked exposing
the boy like that.

109
00:13:00,008 --> 00:13:03,382
To think he would end up
in battle with Orochimaru.

110
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,621
That's why we should keep
him here in the village away

111
00:13:06,654 --> 00:13:10,295
from those who would
seek his power.

112
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:13,067
-I doubt we'll find much support
for that line of thinking.

113
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,037
You know who we're dealing with.

114
00:13:23,186 --> 00:13:27,528
[sigh]

115
00:13:27,528 --> 00:13:28,998
-And?

116
00:13:29,031 --> 00:13:30,700
-We're not giving
up no matter what.

117
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,255
-All right then.

118
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:43,659
If that's the case,
we'll roll you

119
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:45,329
right into your next mission.

120
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:48,467
Stand by at home and
I'll be calling you soon.

121
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:49,436
NARUTO: Yes, ma'am!

122
00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:00,992
Hey, Sakura.

123
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:03,062
What do you say you and I go
out on a day tonight, huh?

124
00:14:03,095 --> 00:14:04,431
-Naruto, have you
already forgotten

125
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:07,303
what Lady Tsunade
told us back there?

126
00:14:07,303 --> 00:14:09,007
-Uh-- say what now?

127
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,445
-We're supposed to stay at
home until Team Kakashi's

128
00:14:11,445 --> 00:14:12,980
next mission has
been determined.

129
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:13,716
Remember?

130
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:15,185
NARUTO: Ah, just
a couple of hours.

131
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:16,320
She'll never even know.

132
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,024
SAKURA: Go on a
date by yourself.

133
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,760
NARUTO: That kind of
defeats the whole purpose,

134
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:21,330
you know what I mean?

135
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,166
TSUNADE: And what about Sai?

136
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,302
-Right.

137
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:26,574
It was exactly as you
had predicted, milady.

138
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:30,280
He was definitely on a secret
mission Danzo had given him.

139
00:14:30,314 --> 00:14:32,618
-A secret mission.

140
00:14:32,651 --> 00:14:34,554
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER): I knew it.

141
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:38,062
YAMATO: It seems Danzo wanted
him to uncover and deal

142
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:40,733
with potential
threats to the Leaf,

143
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:45,410
all while carrying out his
duty as a member of the ANBU.

144
00:14:45,443 --> 00:14:48,748
Sai's whole purpose for
joining us in Team Kakashi

145
00:14:48,748 --> 00:14:53,291
was to strike an enemy of
the Leaf Village, Orochimaru.

146
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:56,363
He meant to rob him
of a body by putting

147
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,300
Sasuke Uchiha in the ground.

148
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:06,449
-Leave it to that
crafty old badger.

149
00:15:06,482 --> 00:15:08,018
Just the kind of
thing I'd expect

150
00:15:08,051 --> 00:15:10,657
from an embittered old
hard-liner like him.

151
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:14,630
But our inherent desire to
protect the Leaf is the same.

152
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:19,273
-Are you talking about
Danzo still, milady?

153
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:19,674
-Yes.

154
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:22,111
I am.

155
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:26,654
-One look at this, and I think
your opinion will change some.

156
00:15:26,688 --> 00:15:27,255
-Hm?

157
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:32,397
What is it?

158
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,733
-Information.

159
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:38,276
Danzo gave it to Sai to use as
an offering should Orochimaru

160
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:39,311
need a little convincing.

161
00:15:45,456 --> 00:15:46,791
-Is that?

162
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:51,468
-A list of ANBU
Black Ops members.

163
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:54,306
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
Danzo, that snake.

164
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:55,475
These files are classified.

165
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:59,181
How on Earth did he get them?

166
00:15:59,215 --> 00:16:00,852
-Um-- milady?

167
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:04,458
-Shizune, tighten security on
the secret archives building!

168
00:16:04,492 --> 00:16:07,631
Make sure that all of the
access codes are swapped out!

169
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:08,668
-Yes, ma'am.

170
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,168
-Now!

171
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,120
I don't believe it.

172
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,324
The cunning old vulture.

173
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:24,163
He's gone too far this time.

174
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:28,471
With Orochimaru and the Akatsuki
besieging us on every side,

175
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:30,442
the last thing I need
is a threat from within.

176
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:37,855
I'll have to put some serious
thought into Sai's earlier

177
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:40,326
request.

178
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,832
-Well, in that case--

179
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:43,400
-Hm?

180
00:16:59,462 --> 00:17:02,403
-I don't think you've ever
failed a special mission

181
00:17:02,436 --> 00:17:04,205
before.

182
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:05,574
It's rather unlike you.

183
00:17:08,614 --> 00:17:11,520
-If I may make a request.

184
00:17:11,553 --> 00:17:12,187
-Request?

185
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,489
Really?

186
00:17:13,523 --> 00:17:14,792
-Yes.

187
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,364
I'd like to keep the name
Sai, and stay with team

188
00:17:17,397 --> 00:17:19,334
Kakashi for a
little while longer.

189
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,548
DANZO (VOICEOVER): That smile.

190
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,729
-Tsunade has also
approached me about this.

191
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:37,669
But be sure that you
remember, Sai-- emotions only

192
00:17:37,702 --> 00:17:42,779
generate hatred, and hatred
breeds nought but conflict.

193
00:17:45,784 --> 00:17:50,593
-Between my older brother and
me, it's the bond of hatred.

194
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:56,805
SAI (VOICEOVER): That
may be true, but still.

195
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,817
-After all, Sasuke's
the person who

196
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,791
accepted me more
than anybody else.

197
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:11,432
Sasuke is my best friend.

198
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:14,806
It took a while, but now
we have a special bond.

199
00:18:57,821 --> 00:18:58,822
You think?

200
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:01,695
Do you know what comrade means?

201
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:02,496
-Why, yes.

202
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:05,869
Of course I know it.

203
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:06,971
You write it like this.

204
00:19:31,318 --> 00:19:32,687
NARUTO: Hey, Sai!

205
00:19:41,705 --> 00:19:42,740
Come on!

206
00:19:42,773 --> 00:19:44,876
We're meeting to go
over our next mission!

207
00:20:00,507 --> 00:20:02,477
Hurry up, will you!

208
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:02,911
SAI: OK.

209
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:03,445
I'm coming.

210
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,865
[theme music]

211
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:02,137
KAKASHI: Yamato filled me in.

212
00:22:02,171 --> 00:22:03,506
You saw Sasuke.

213
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,942
-He's gotten so powerful.

214
00:22:04,976 --> 00:22:06,913
We're out of time,
and I'm still not

215
00:22:06,913 --> 00:22:08,950
strong enough to bring him back.

216
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:11,488
-Sasuke's growth
just isn't natural.

217
00:22:11,521 --> 00:22:13,926
Lady Tsunade thinks it's
forbidden jutsu or drug

218
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:14,928
enhancements.

219
00:22:14,928 --> 00:22:16,198
KAKASHI: Then we'll
just have to get

220
00:22:16,198 --> 00:22:18,468
you stronger in a hurry, huh?

221
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:19,904
-But how are we
supposed to do that?

222
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,641
KAKASHI: I haven't
just been lying here.

223
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:25,715
I've been brainstorming,
and I've got an idea.

224
00:22:25,749 --> 00:22:28,821
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Next time-- Nightmare.

225
00:22:28,855 --> 00:22:30,791
[theme music]

226
00:22:42,013 --> 00:22:42,814
-Home again.

227
00:22:56,673 --> 00:22:57,608
KAKASHI: OK.

228
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:58,611
Picture time, everybody.

229
00:22:58,645 --> 00:22:59,212
Let's go.

230
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:00,748
-Ah, come on.

231
00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:03,487
Why the heck do I have to be in
some stupid picture with him?

232
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,657
SASUKE: That's my
line, you knucklehead.

233
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,860
NARUTO: Hey, what was that?

234
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:07,829
KAKASHI: All right.

235
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:09,231
Let's just make
the best of this.

236
00:23:09,231 --> 00:23:10,567
-No complaints here.

237
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,871
I've always wanted a
picture of us together.

238
00:23:12,904 --> 00:23:13,906
-You're kidding.

239
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,712
I've always wanted
a picture of us too!

240
00:23:16,712 --> 00:23:19,117
-We don't need
Naruto in it, sensei.

241
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,100
-Agh!

242
00:23:20,134 --> 00:23:21,001
Ah, come on!

243
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:21,903
-Ha.

244
00:23:21,936 --> 00:23:22,753
-Don't you laugh!

245
00:23:22,787 --> 00:23:23,587
-Why shouldn't I?

246
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:25,122
KAKASHI: Knock if off, you two.

247
00:23:25,122 --> 00:23:27,925
Let the photographer
do his job, OK?

248
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,693
We're taking this for posterity.

249
00:23:29,727 --> 00:23:31,796
Now let's see some smiles.

250
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:32,863
OK.

251
00:23:32,863 --> 00:23:34,732
Get ready.
