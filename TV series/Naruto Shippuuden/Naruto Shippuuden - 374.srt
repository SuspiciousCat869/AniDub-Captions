your chakra with
everyone... again?

2
00:00:16,247 --> 00:00:20,985
{\an1}Not right now. Kurama
isn't done recharging
his chakra, yet.

3
00:00:22,855 --> 00:00:29,127
{\an4}To take down the main
body, we need to mow down
the big ones, or find
some way to slip past them.

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,597
{\an1}It's too far to reach
in a single leap.

5
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,967
{\an1}We'll need time to weave
signs and repel the
enemy's attacks.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,271
{\an1}Without your chakra,
Naruto, we could suffer
heavy casualties.

{\an1}And the Medical Corps
can't come here.

{\an1}We need to mow them down
and slip past, huh?
That'll be easy.

9

in one leap. And repel any
enemy attacks, too.

Suigetsu! In fact, you're even
grosser and weirder because
you have a human form!

142
00:13:49,782 --> 00:13:54,653
{\an1}Karin... Let Tsunade
bite you so that she
can heal.

143
00:13:54,687 --> 00:13:59,124
{\an1}What? But I don't want anyone
but Sasuke biting me! Come on!

144
00:13:59,158 --> 00:14:02,060
Hah! You just admitted
you're in love with Sasuke!

145
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:07,865
{\an1}No way! You're completely wrong!
How could I hate- I mean <i>like</i>
that damn Sasuke?

146
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:09,000
{\an1}That wasn't a sentence...

147
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:12,869
{\an1}[flustered] He tried to kill
me and it was irresistible!

148
00:14:12,904 --> 00:14:14,606
{\an1}No it wasn't...

149
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,643
{\an1}You were covered in bite marks
long before Sasuke bit you!

150
00:14:18,676 --> 00:14:21,144
{\an1}Shut up! I'm for Sasuke's
exclusive use now!

151
00:14:21,178 --> 00:14:23,814
Don't freak out you
denture mold model!

152
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:27,084
And besides, how exactly
does your body work, anyway?

153
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,784
You're the real
weird on here...

154
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:30,721
{\an1}Say that again!!

155
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,223
{\an1}You two... hurry up!
[gulps]

156
00:14:34,258 --> 00:14:38,194
{\an1}<i>Both</i> of you are weird, okay?!
Now stop your squabbling!

157
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:48,371
{\an4}'Cause otherwise... I'll have my
snakes tie you up, and then I'll
crawl into your mouth and
possess you both!

158
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:51,374
<i>[Thinking]</i>
<i>You're the weirdest</i>
<i>one out of all of us!</i>

159
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:54,744
{\an1}<i>[Thinking]</i>
<i>Now that's weird</i>
<i>AND abnormal...</i>

160
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:16,930
[sucking]

161
00:15:17,464 --> 00:15:20,234
<i>[Thinking]</i>
<i>She's taking so much that I</i>
<i>might age into a hag. </i>

162
00:15:38,151 --> 00:15:41,887
{\an1}Lady Tsunade! You're
going to be okay!

163
00:15:42,322 --> 00:15:46,259
{\an1}Tsunade, you could
be a little more
grateful.

164
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:50,395
{\an1}You betrayed the Leaf Village,
so why do this? And why now?

165
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:54,366
{\an1}The range of things that
interest me has just expanded.

166
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,339
{\an1}In the past, I wanted to
become the wind and turn
the windmill myself.

167
00:16:00,372 --> 00:16:06,177
{\an7}<i>But now I know the pleasure</i>
<i>of waiting around for</i>
<i>someone else's wind...</i>

168
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:13,951
{\an7}<i>...one that is unpredictable.</i>
<i>I don't want that wind to get</i>
<i>sealed away before I can enjoy</i>
<i>it...</i>

169
00:16:13,984 --> 00:16:18,723
{\an1}You still don't make one
bit of sense whatsoever.

170
00:16:18,756 --> 00:16:22,727
{\an1}Although, seems
you've changed a bit.

171
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,895
{\an1}I never imagined that
you would save me...

172
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:28,398
{\an1}Stranger things
have happened.

173
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:32,168
{\an1}Do you remember it? That
Three-Way Deadlock?

174
00:16:32,202 --> 00:16:34,270
{\an1}Our summonings...

175
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:39,074
{\an1}No! Just like how it's
written! The Three-Way
Deadlock?

176
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:46,783
Earth Style Stone
Pistol Jutsu!

177
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:09,537
{\an1}[labored breathing]

178
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:15,543
Hm?

179
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,813
{\an1}It's useless, Tsunade.

180
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:23,216
{\an1}The Hidden Stone's Earth
Style will most likely
collapse this mountain.

181
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,953
{\an1}If we're to escape, we can't
wait. The two of us must go.

182
00:17:26,987 --> 00:17:29,156
{\an1}No. Jiraiya, too!

183
00:17:29,189 --> 00:17:34,360
{\an1}We cannot bring Jiraiya
and still expect to outrun
the Hidden Stone!

184
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:37,029
{\an1}That's why I'll use Medical
Ninjutsu to help him-

185
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:39,866
{\an7}Tsunade! We are
at war now!

186
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,537
{\an7}We cannot let emotions get
in the way and reduce the
chance of success.

187
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,405
{\an1}And what is success?

188
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:49,475
{\an1}It's to survive, of
course! What else?

189
00:17:49,508 --> 00:17:54,914
{\an1}One alone can't. Two probably
can. But with three...

190
00:17:54,946 --> 00:17:57,348
{\an1}...it's certain death.

191
00:17:57,382 --> 00:17:59,484
[gasp]

192
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:05,590
{\an1}Quickly, you go on
ahead, and I will
take care of Jiraiya!

193
00:18:05,623 --> 00:18:10,260
Make one move...
and I'll kill you
in a heartbeat.

194
00:18:22,004 --> 00:18:24,341
Seems we're in a
Three-Way Deadlock.

195
00:18:24,374 --> 00:18:30,146
{\an1}What's that mean? This whole
situation just boils down to
who will act first.

196
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:32,916
{\an1}Jiraiya is already--

197
00:18:35,051 --> 00:18:45,060
{\an1}[labored breathing]

198
00:18:45,093 --> 00:18:50,599
{\an1}[labored breathing]

199
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:50,665
{\an1}[gasp]

200
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:56,938
{\an1}You see? Jiraiya trusts
you completely, Orochimaru.

201
00:18:56,972 --> 00:19:00,542
{\an1}So much so, it even
freezes you in your
tracks.

202
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:03,979
[gasp]

203
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:07,014
{\an1}What foolishness!
I shall just...

204
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:11,085
[explosion]

205
00:19:11,118 --> 00:19:16,423
{\an1}Over here! Jiraiya, Tsunade,
Orochimaru! I've brought
reinforcements!

206
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:38,143
{\an4}People really can
change. Or they die
before they have a
chance to.

207
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:43,649
{\an1}Although <i>he</i> passed away
without changing...

208
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:49,021
{\an1}And you know what? He probably
trusted you until the very end.

209
00:19:53,157 --> 00:20:00,131
{\an1}Orochimaru! If you'd become like
this sooner, then Jiraiya...
might not be dead now!

210
00:20:00,164 --> 00:20:06,337
{\an1}Yet if I had... Jiraiya
may have also changed.

211
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:13,410
{\an4}Just like it was with
us, the Legendary Sannin,
things don't always go
the way you want them to.

212
00:20:13,444 --> 00:20:21,484
{\an1}We're not made of stone.
Distortions will appear
somewhere.

213
00:20:21,518 --> 00:20:26,256
{\an7}<i>[Thinking]</i>
<i>Perhaps that's why I want to</i>
<i>observe Sasuke's future...</i>

214
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:31,695
{\an7}<i>...while patiently </i>
<i>waiting for his </i>
<i>wind to blow.</i>

215
00:20:31,728 --> 00:20:35,531
{\an1}Fine... I give you thanks
for helping me heal.

216
00:20:35,564 --> 00:20:40,003
So, I take it you
know all about the
war?

217
00:20:40,036 --> 00:20:44,340
{\an1}Of course. That's why
I'm helping you out
like this.

218
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:45,608
{\an1}Don't you see?

219
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:47,977
How long have
I  been...?

220
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,511
{\an1}I can report on the
battle situation.

221
00:20:50,546 --> 00:20:55,017
{\an1}Katsuyu? How'd you end
up on the battle front?

222
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:59,153
{\an1}<i>[Thinking]</i>
<i>I see... Sakura</i>
<i>Summoned her!</i>

223
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:04,592
{\an1}Right about now,... a new
Three-Way Deadlock is
probably making their debut.

224
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:08,495
{\an1}Well then, we should
be heading back now.

225
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:12,666
{\an1}Tsunade, you should
get to work on healing
the other Kage.

226
00:22:57,766 --> 00:23:00,501
{\an1}<i>[Obito]</i>
<i>So there is still doubt</i>
<i>in your heart, is there?</i>

227
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:01,836
<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>Won't you stop this?</i>

228
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:05,506
{\an1}<i>[Obito]</i>
<i>I want to negate</i>
<i>everything he desires!</i>

229
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:08,542
{\an5}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>I'm certain you must</i>
<i>understand Naruto's</i>
<i>feelings!</i>

230
00:23:08,576 --> 00:23:10,511
{\an1}<i>[Obito]</i>
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>in my heart!</i>

231
00:23:10,544 --> 00:23:14,115
{\an5}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>Do you think... such</i>
<i>things can fill the</i>
<i>hole in your heart? </i>

232
00:23:14,148 --> 00:23:17,184
{\an4}<i>[Obito]</i>
<i>Just like how it</i>
<i>was with me! Right,</i>
<i>Kakashi?</i>

233
00:23:17,218 --> 00:23:21,755
<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>"Kakashi versus Obito."</i>

234
00:23:21,788 --> 00:23:25,324
{\an1}(Kakashi)
This is all that the
current me can do.
