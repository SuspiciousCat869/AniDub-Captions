00:00:29,674 --> 00:00:31,375
{\an1}Sakura...

{\an1}Yugao, take
her away.

00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:38,747
{\an1}Okay...

00:01:10,934 --> 00:01:13,301

{\an1}Beetle Sphere!

12
00:01:31,345 --> 00:01:35,682
{\an7}<i>Well, there's no doubt</i>
<i>that the body count has</i>
<i>increased by this point.</i>

13
00:01:35,715 --> 00:01:38,851
{\an7}<i>I guess I'll begin</i>
<i>the next stage...</i>

14
00:03:27,652 --> 00:03:29,854
{\an1}Awake now, are you?

15
00:03:33,522 --> 00:03:36,658
{\an1}Tell me, have you
missed this world?

16
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:39,827
{\an1}Wait, you're--

17
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,562
{\an1}...Kabuto Yakushi!

18
00:03:45,063 --> 00:03:48,398
{\an1}You're going to have
to learn a bit more
discretion...

19
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:50,834
...keep in mind
that you're talking
to your new master.

20
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,636
{\an1}But, what is this...?
What... am I...?

21
00:03:56,838 --> 00:03:58,038
{\an1}[gasp]

22
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:05,009
{\an1}Oh? You can smell the
blood, is that it?

23
00:04:05,043 --> 00:04:08,377
{\an1}More than ten
or twenty...
Is there a war?

24
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:10,512
{\an1}Don't tell me that--
he Hidden Leaf--!

25
00:04:10,545 --> 00:04:15,448
{\an1}It's always so amusing
how you dead people
deal with a lapse in time.

26
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:18,884
{\an1}The destruction of
the Hidden Leaf
occurred long ago...

27
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:21,786
{\an1}Oh, I see. What's
happening with
the Leaf now?

28
00:04:22,587 --> 00:04:25,689
{\an1}Something like that
should be no concern
of the dead.

29
00:04:25,722 --> 00:04:29,490
{\an1}In any event, that's
neither here nor there.

30
00:04:29,524 --> 00:04:34,995
{\an4}The war you sensed is
entering its middle
stage, and working alone
can be boring at times.

31
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:37,629
So I don't mind
you keeping me
company...

32
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:44,100
{\an4}The last thing that I can
remember is tailing you because
you were working for Orochimaru,
spying on the Village.

33
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:47,635
{\an1}Yes, that was three
years ago...

34
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:52,906
{\an1}Under Lord Orochimaru's
orders, I was acting as his
liaison with the Hidden Sand.

35
00:04:53,206 --> 00:05:02,979
{\an4}<i>What you're remembering</i>
<i>occurred about a month</i>
<i>before the attack on the</i>
<i>Leaf...</i>

36
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,546
You're late.

37
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:07,615
You're the ones
who requested
this meeting!

38
00:05:07,648 --> 00:05:12,018
{\an4}My apologies! I had to
check the area to make
sure that I wasn't seen
or followed...

39
00:05:12,051 --> 00:05:15,419
Hmph. Yes, same
goes for us.

40
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:19,022
{\an5}<i>None of us can</i>
<i>afford to have</i>
<i>any leaks</i>
<i>whatsoever.</i>

41
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,459
{\an4}Now let's get on with
this. Hand over the plans
and whatever else you
have to give me.

42
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:27,160
{\an1}First I need to
verify it...

43
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,962
{\an1}Is he the one,
that guy over there?

44
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,030
What exactly
are you up to?

45
00:05:32,063 --> 00:05:34,498
{\an1}No, you misunderstand.

46
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:38,567
{\an1}We of the Sound place
great value on our
partnership with the Sand.

47
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,804
{\an4}However, I question
how for this venture,
the Sand dispatched only
four including you.

48
00:05:44,838 --> 00:05:47,040
So that's it. You
don't trust us, do you?

49
00:05:47,073 --> 00:05:53,877
{\an4}No such thing! But if something
unfortunate does happen, then
all of us are going to have to
watch each other's backs.

50
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:59,047
{\an4}And that's why we simply
want to make sure of him
since he's the cornerstone
to all of our plans.

51
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:02,750
{\an1}Oh, look. Someone
else is here...

52
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,852
What a fool! He'll
be slaughtered!

53
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:17,692
{\an1}<i>Well, well, Look at</i>
<i>this... Don't you </i>
<i>ever sleep at all?</i>

54
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:19,860
Why are you here?
What do you want?

55
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:23,596
{\an1}I was planning on
attacking you while
you slept...

56
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:30,733
{\an4}If I fight and defeat you
now, then in the next round
I can battle the one I
really want to face...

57
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:32,534
{\an1}...Sasuke.

58
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:35,703
{\an1}I already know all
about your Sand attack.

59
00:06:36,804 --> 00:06:39,506
[groan]

60
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:45,143
{\an4}What's wrong? Not
feeling well? Then
I'll put you out
of your  misery!

61
00:06:45,176 --> 00:06:50,079
[grunts]

62
00:06:50,112 --> 00:06:52,113
[gasp]

63
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:59,152
When the moon is
full, it's blood boils.

64
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:08,958
{\an1}[struggling grunts]

65
00:07:08,991 --> 00:07:12,459
{\an1}Wha- what in the
world are you!?

66
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:21,832
{\an1}I see. You're the
ultimate weapon
of the Sand, huh?

67
00:07:21,865 --> 00:07:26,202
{\an1}Still... I cannot
let you have Sasuke.

68
00:07:26,235 --> 00:07:28,602
{\an1}Even for Lord
Orochimaru's sake!

00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:33,673

{\an1}He's so fast!

<i>Gaara's true form </i>
<i>then, is it?</i>

75

I can't believe it!
A Tailed Beast, brought
into this village!

00:08:09,162 --> 00:08:10,930
{\an1}[panting breaths]

77
00:08:10,963 --> 00:08:14,531
{\an1}<i>(Kabuto)</i>
<i>Well, there's certainly</i>
<i>no denying it's power...</i>

78
00:08:14,565 --> 00:08:17,201
{\an1}<i>(Kabuto)</i>
<i>...but are you actually</i>
<i>able to control it?</i>

79
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:23,738
{\an4}At that level, yes. But
when the One Tail transforms
completely and activates his
Playing Possum Jutsu...

80
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,206
...there's no
stopping him.

81
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,675
{\an1}All right, fine. We'd
best not agitate him
any further for now, then.

82
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:33,311
{\an1}But I  look forward to
seeing him run amok  when
the time finally comes.

83
00:08:33,344 --> 00:08:36,079
{\an1}Listen, is this okay?
He was a Sound Ninja.

84
00:08:36,113 --> 00:08:39,848
{\an5}<i>(Kabuto)</i>
<i>Yes, it's fine. He's</i>
<i>long since served</i>
<i>his purpose...</i>

85
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:44,784
{\an5}But I thought he was a
guinea pig intended to
test the power of that
kid Sasuke.

86
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:48,120
{\an1}That's true... Or
it was. It isn't
necessary anymore.

87
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,621
I was

88
00:08:51,654 --> 00:08:54,757
However, I'm afraid
that I failed in that
mission. [chuckle]

89
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:57,359
{\an1}Wait, you what!?

90
00:08:57,393 --> 00:09:01,862
{\an1}That's right. They've
discovered that I'm an
agent of the Sound Village.

91
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:06,064
{\an1}I thought you were
Orochimaru's
right-hand man...

92
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:10,900
{\an1}But after being revealed to
them, you just nonchalantly
come here and meet with me?

93
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:12,368
{\an1}You're a fool...

94
00:09:12,402 --> 00:09:16,971
{\an4}Well, actually,
they didn't discover
my true identity all
on their own...

95
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:19,206
{\an1}...I let them
find out...

96
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:24,675
{\an4}I wanted to see just how
far the Leaf Village would
go when they discovered
the truth.

97
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:28,779
It's a plan that was
originally posed by
the Sound Village, so...

98
00:09:28,812 --> 00:09:31,247
<i>...The Sand won't</i>
<i>make a move 'til</i>
<i>the last moment.</i>

99
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,149
<i>This is the will </i>
<i>of the Kazekage.</i>

100
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:35,816
{\an1}<i>This can't be...</i>

101
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:39,886
{\an1}this is the plan
you're to carry out.

102
00:09:42,853 --> 00:09:47,724
{\an1}And remember... make sure
you tell them about this
plan as soon as possible.

103
00:09:47,757 --> 00:09:52,126
{\an7}<i>To think our ally, the</i>
<i>Sand Village, has a </i>
<i>secret pact with the</i>
<i>Sand Village..!</i>

104
00:09:55,729 --> 00:10:00,098
One more thing...
I'll take care of
our little spy.

105
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:04,034
{\an1}No, wait. I will
handle this...

106
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:07,869
{\an1}...it's just one
little spy, it'll
be easy!

107
00:10:07,903 --> 00:10:09,171
[gasp]

108
00:10:16,008 --> 00:10:19,043
{\an1}<i>(Hayate)</i>
<i>Something isn't sitting</i>
<i>right with me...</i>

109
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:24,213
{\an4}You were on the scene
when it all went down.
So then why didn't you
try to help the Sand?

110
00:10:24,246 --> 00:10:27,882
{\an1}Simply because it didn't
matter to me one bit who
might have died...

111
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:33,919
{\an4}Baki didn't possess the
strength to stop Shikakau's
rampage, which meant that he
was essentially useless to me.

112
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:36,654
{\an1}There are always
replacements...

113
00:10:36,687 --> 00:10:42,392
{\an4}<i>Besides, at the time, the</i>
<i>Sound didn't have an </i>
<i>effective route toward </i>
<i>gathering intel on the Sand.</i>

114
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:48,261
{\an4}Keep in mind that the
Sand easily turned their
backs on their alliance with
the Leaf when it suited them.

115
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:53,631
{\an4}To keep tabs on the Sand's
true intentions, it sure
didn't hurt to have a
corpse at our disposal.

116
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,104
I drafted a temporary
report on the status of
each company for you.

117
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:04,339
{\an1}This says the number
of casualties spiked
during the night...

118
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:08,807
I hesitate to even
bring this up, but...

119
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:11,276
Our fallen are stored
in a secret warehouse.

120
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,178
If those bodies were to
fall into the hands of
the enemy somehow...

121
00:11:15,212 --> 00:11:18,981
{\an1}Their DNA data could be taken
and the enemy could turn them
into weapons against us.

122
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:22,749
{\an1}Don't worry. You
see, I've already
taken care of it.

123
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:27,819
{\an4}<i>However, there are many</i>
<i>who've fallen on the</i>
<i>battlefield who can't</i>
<i>yet be recovered...</i>

124
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:33,057
I'm certain about
it. These three
were elite shinobi.

125
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,391
{\an1}I'll put them in safe
keeping immediately.

126
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:36,925
Yes. That's wise.

127
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:41,028
{\an1}You should bring this one,
too. He was an elite.

128
00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:43,896
{\an1}All right, I will.
Please line him up
with the others.

129
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:45,898
{\an1}Will do.

130
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:51,701
{\an4}The ones with Kekkei
Genkai and their relatives,
as well as other elite
Shinobi, are being given

131
00:11:51,734 --> 00:11:56,037
{\an1}the highest priority in the
handling and safekeeping of
their remains within scrolls.

132
00:11:57,038 --> 00:12:01,407
{\an4}When all of this is over,
we'll return them to their
villages along with the
rest of the deceased.

133
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,083
I'll be going
back now.

134
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:16,717
Thank you.

135
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:25,089
She's quite skillful
and efficient.

136
00:12:25,122 --> 00:12:29,259
{\an1}Yes, well the word is that
Yugao used to belong
to the ANBU Black ops.

137
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:32,327
She's a former
ANBU? So what
is she doing here?

138
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:34,362
{\an1}I don't know. But
it helps to have her.

139
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:49,104
{\an1}Corpses make such
incredibly useful tools.

140
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:52,072
{\an1}You can revive them in
order to get information.

141
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:54,874
You can use them
as weapons...

142
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:58,477
{\an1}You can get unusual
data from their flesh...

143
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:03,346
{\an5}Although, it's a
shame, I wasn't able
to get a hold of Baki's
corpse back then.

144
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:24,059
[grunt]

145
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,896

00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:46,340
[cough]

147
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:49,242
You're mine!

148
00:13:50,075 --> 00:13:51,009
{\an3}Huh!?

149
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:08,120
{\an4}This is unexpected.
I thought that this
flight would be settled
almost immediately.

150
00:14:08,154 --> 00:14:12,923
{\an4}I have to say... That
proctor was very slick
to slip past me the way
he did...

151
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:19,027
{\an1}Sheathing your sword?!

152
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:21,062
Now...

153
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:26,498
{\an1}Leaf Style! Crescent
Moon Dance!

154
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:37,505
[grunt] Mu sword
is stuck...!

155
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:39,473
{\an1}Your talent with a
sword in superb.

156
00:14:39,506 --> 00:14:43,909
{\an1}Of course, stopping a
sword is easy, and only
a rudimentary skill.

157
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:50,513
{\an1}However... A Wind Sword
is a different story...
No one can stop it!

158
00:14:53,382 --> 00:14:56,417
[dying gasp]

159
00:15:08,358 --> 00:15:12,994
{\an5}(Kabuto)
How unfortunate. I
guess that you should
have tried a little harder.

160
00:15:13,027 --> 00:15:16,029
But, oh well.
[chuckle]

161
00:15:16,062 --> 00:15:18,298
{\an1}Your jutsu failed,
but you fought well.

162
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,567
{\an1}Perhaps in the future,
you'll be useful...

163
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,835
<i>[dogs barking]</i>
Huh?

164
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:25,801
[gasp]

165
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:31,273
It's so quiet.

166
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,840
{\an1}The reports said it
came from somewhere
around this area.

167
00:15:42,013 --> 00:15:43,648
{\an1}Hey!

168
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:48,450
{\an4}We got a report that
there was some kind
of skirmish around here.
...you see anything?

169
00:15:48,484 --> 00:15:48,517
{\an1}I'm sorry, but I didn't!
I'm only passing
through, I'm afraid.

170
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,020
{\an1}<i>Alright.</i>

171
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:57,455
{\an5}With the upcoming
Chunin Exam, there
have been a lot of
disturbing rumors.

172
00:16:00,257 --> 00:16:02,325
C'mon, let's go.

173
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:05,193
I suggest you get
home quickly.

174
00:16:05,227 --> 00:16:07,094
Thank you for
your concern,

175
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:14,500
{\an4}<i>I completely erased</i>
<i>the scent. It should</i>
<i>be quite a while before</i>
<i>the body is discovered.</i>

176
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:18,368
{\an7}<i>If I return and get</i>
<i>caught that would be</i>
<i>a serious bother.</i>

177
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:22,004
{\an7}<i>Oh well. Just his</i>

<i>sufficient.</i>

178
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:28,041
{\an5}<i>(Kabuto)</i>
<i>Shortly after that,</i>
<i>during the final round</i>
<i>of the Chunin Exam...</i>

179
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:32,010
{\an1}<i>Shukaku went on a</i>
<i>rampage and descended</i>
<i>upon the Hidden Leaf.</i>

180
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:35,346
{\an1}And what happened
to the Village?

181
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:39,582
{\an1}Regrettably, those
annoying meddlers
are still around.

182
00:16:39,616 --> 00:16:42,950
{\an1}Although, the world
has changed drastically...

183
00:16:44,051 --> 00:16:47,119
{\an1}The Third Hokage died
in the attack on the Leaf.

184
00:16:47,153 --> 00:16:51,089
{\an1}Several years later,
Sasuke got rid of Lord
Orochimaru...

185
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:53,891
{\an1}And I have gained
numerous new powers!

186
00:17:02,496 --> 00:17:06,498
[screams]

187
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,300
{\an1}I see you're still
an enemy of the Leaf.

188
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:13,403
{\an1}Yes, I am. And right
now, you are on the
same side as me.

189
00:17:13,437 --> 00:17:15,071
I reanimated you
to be my pawn.

190
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:27,446
{\an4}At present, the Five
Great Nations have
formed an alliance and
a grisly battle rages on.

191
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:31,114
{\an4}It's an all-out war
with every village
committing every man
available...

192
00:17:31,147 --> 00:17:33,082
{\an1}But that's actually
good news for me!

193
00:17:33,115 --> 00:17:35,883
{\an1}It's a great opportunity
to collect some new samples.

194
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,219
<i>And that is where</i>
<i>you come in.</i>

195
00:17:46,658 --> 00:17:50,460
{\an1}May I ask you a
question, Yugao? You see,
I'm a little curious...

196
00:17:50,493 --> 00:17:53,462
Yes, it it's a
simple question.

197
00:17:53,495 --> 00:17:55,862
{\an1}I heard you were once
with the ANBU Black Ops.

198
00:17:56,497 --> 00:18:00,199
{\an1}With skills like that, what
are you doing here, helping
out in the medical camp?

199
00:18:03,468 --> 00:18:07,471
{\an1}Every company on the
battlefield is shorthanded!
Someone like you--

200
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:11,473
I just can't!
I simply can't
fight anymore...

What just happened!?

00:18:25,348 --> 00:18:28,317
{\an1}That explosion!
It's at the vault!

{\an1}That scroll contains the
bodies of Allied Shinobi
killed in action!

213
00:19:02,705 --> 00:19:05,473
{\an1}They're after elite
Shinobi! Go stop them!

00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:48,233
That's enough.
Let's go.

225
00:19:58,373 --> 00:20:00,708
{\an1}Where's Shizune now?

226
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,376
Uh, in surgery.
She just went in.

227
00:20:04,043 --> 00:20:07,045
{\an1}Go notify Headquarters
immediately!

228
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:09,613
...and get all
the wounded inside
the tent!

{\an1}Right!

230
00:20:10,581 --> 00:20:14,049
{\an1}There were so many
elite in that scroll.

231
00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:16,284
I got a good look
at the assailants.

232
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:19,519
I believe one of them
was a Hidden Leaf
Special Jonin.

233
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:21,354
If I'm right, his
name's Hayate Gekko.

234
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,389
{\an1}Understood. We're going
to have to make sure that
the medical tent is guarded.

235
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:28,025
{\an1}But the situation doesn't
look too good. We can't
spare many people.

236
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:32,260
{\an1}We'll contact HQ. We
have to ask them to
send us reinforcements.

237
00:20:32,462 --> 00:20:35,095
So, Iou, Yokaze;
will you go see to it?

238
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:35,730
{\an3}Yes!

239
00:20:36,764 --> 00:20:38,431
{\an1}I'll go as well.

240
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:42,534
{\an4}Ny combat experience

increase this mission's
chance of success.

00:20:42,568 --> 00:20:43,735
{\an1}Great. Thank you.

242
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:46,269

you to go along, too.

243
00:20:46,303 --> 00:20:48,370
{\an1}What!?

244
00:20:48,405 --> 00:20:52,507
{\an4}I know that you aren't part
of the combat forces, but a
Sensory-type is essential to
track the enemy...

245
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,107
...You're the
only one we have!

246
00:20:54,141 --> 00:20:56,376
{\an1}That's impossible.
I can't do it!

{\an1}Yugao, please...

248
00:20:57,376 --> 00:21:00,045
It's an emergency!
Why won't you do this!?

249
00:21:02,781 --> 00:21:07,282
