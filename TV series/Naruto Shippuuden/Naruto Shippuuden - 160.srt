{\an1}It's grown more heads.

161
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:09,745
{\an1}-Seems like a special
type of summoning.

162
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:12,246
{\an1}We need to take on the caster
rather than face this thing.

163
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:22,257
{\an1}-So what should we
do now, Shizune?

164
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,192
{\an1}-Leave it to them.

165
00:11:27,864 --> 00:11:29,866
{\an1}-Summoning Jutsu.

166
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:32,335
-Huh?

167
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:32,836
-Ah!

[roaring]

169
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,274

171
00:11:59,131 --> 00:12:00,065
This is it.

172
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:17,283
{\an1}-It seems I made it in time.

-Lady Katsuyu,
thank you so much.

-Please forgive
me, Lady Katsuyu.

175

{\an1}I'm not used to you.

176
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:25,391
{\an1}-Oh, that's all right.

177
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,834
{\an1}-They are powerful summonings.

{\an1}Everyone, please be careful.

179
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:39,640
{\an1}-There's no mistake.

180
00:12:39,674 --> 00:12:44,012
{\an1}I saw her inside the memories
of that Hidden Rain ninja.

181
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:45,747
{\an1}But how can this be?

182
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,548
-What is it?

183
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:52,487
-When I saw her,
she was a corpse.

184
00:12:56,792 --> 00:13:01,464
{\an1}-(VOICEOVER) And that corpse
is now using a summoning jutsu.

185
00:13:01,497 --> 00:13:03,299
But each of the
Six Pains is only

186
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:06,769
{\an1}supposed to be able
to use a single jutsu.

187
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:09,005
{\an1}Something's wrong.

188
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,273
{\an1}According to Lord
Fukasaku, the only Pain

189
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:14,177
{\an1}that can do summonings
is the one I autopsied.

190
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,445
{\an1}What does this mean?

191
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:17,848
{\an1}Lord Jiraiya already
defeated the only Pain

192
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,884
{\an1}with this ability.

193
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:24,155
{\an1}Inoichi, please give
me more details.

194
00:13:24,188 --> 00:13:26,157
We might be able
to figure this out.

195
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,125
-Right now?

196
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:28,826
But we can't.

197
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,795
{\an1}-Leave this to the ANBU and me.

198
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:32,096
Get out of here.

199
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,664

00:13:33,698 --> 00:13:34,199
-Quick.

201
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:35,333
Let's go.

202
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:37,502
{\an1}Inoichi, we must uncover
Pain's true identity.

203
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,043
{\an1}We have to hurry and get
to the Cipher Division.

204
00:13:45,077 --> 00:13:46,979
We should bring
Ino with us so she

205
00:13:47,012 --> 00:13:49,982
can support your
jutsu, Master Inoichi.
