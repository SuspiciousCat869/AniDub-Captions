[yawn]

2
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:19,720
-You're getting a little
too laid back, aren't you?

3
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:22,389
-Things have been so tense
around here for so long,

4
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,658
what with that business
in the Sand village.

5
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:27,327
Now that the danger's
finally over, I'm exhausted.

6
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,496
-The immediate
danger may be over,

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,032
but that doesn't mean
we can lower our guard.

8
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,700
Who knows what'll happen next?

9
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,636
Only by maintaining
maximum vigilance at all--

10
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:36,637
-Oh, come on.

11
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:37,971
You can't live like that.

12
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,573
You'll give yourself
a heart attack.

13
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:40,507
Relax a little.

14
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:41,108
Relax.

15
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,117
-Ha ha!

16
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,452
That'll teach you to go
picking on a poor little cat,

17
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:53,053
you bully.

[alarm ringing]

00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,565
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Great.

20
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,333
What's the point of
setting the alarm

21
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,635
if I'm going to wake
up before it goes off?

22
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:10,671
What a total waste.

23
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:14,708
Now I've got to shut it off,
but I don't feel like moving.

24
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,977
But if I don't
shut it off, it'll

25
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,679
just keep ringing and ringing.

26
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,113
Ugh.

27
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:23,250
It makes me tired just
thinking about the whole thing.

28
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,120
Some mornings are such a drag.

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,589
-I'll take some more.

30
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:29,690
-Hm?

31
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:30,557
What's that?

[footsteps]

33
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,112
-Nearly there!

34
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,981
The finish line is in sight!

35
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:54,381
Victory!

36
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,520
First place.

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,989
-Uh.

38
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:07,361
[shouting]

39
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:10,530
-Only second place, but close!

40
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:11,665
-What kind of race is that?

41
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,334
-I don't know.

42
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:17,304
-It's clear to me that you
need more training, Lee.

43
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,372
-You are right.

44
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,674
And next time I will
try to come in first.

45
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,376
-Well, Lee.

46
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,645
I hate to break it to you,
but I have some bad news.

47
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:25,512
-Huh?

48
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,115
What would that be, Sensei?

49
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,516
-Just this.

50
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,352
You did not come in second!

51
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:37,391
You finished in third place!

52
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:40,260
You're forgetting I
have Kakashi on my back.

53
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:43,497
Technically, he came in second.

54
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,631
-Did you hear that, Kakashi?

55
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,999
You're a lucky man.

56
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:49,503
But there's no need to thank me

57
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,506
-You have taught me yet another
valuable lesson, sensei.

58
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,174
I still have so much to learn!

59
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:57,344
-I'll never get these two, their
ridiculous level of intensity.

60
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,545
-Still.

61
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:01,081
Hey got us back to the
village pretty darn fast, eh?

62
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,016
-Ridiculous.

63
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,217
-All right, then.

64
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,319
Everyone accounted for?

65
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,089
Let's report in to Lady
Tsunade right away.

66
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,991
-Uh, Guy-sensei.

67
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,392
-What is it?

68
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,227
-Kakashi-sensei's
looking a little--

69
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,662
-Hm?

70
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:16,329
Gah!

71
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,130
You're right.

72
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,699
First stop the hospital.

73
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:19,666
then we'll report in.

74
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,273
[theme music]

75
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,022
-Hey.

76
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:22,455
Look.

77
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,258
He's awake.

78
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,495
-So, I'm back here again, huh?

79
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,063
-Good job, Kakashi.

80
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,264
Well done.

81
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,499
-M'lady.

82
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,466
-Huh?

83
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,067
Lady Tsunade.

84
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,438
SAKURA: Nom Kakashi-sensei.

85
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,973
You mustn't push yourself.

86
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,107
TSUNADE: Sakura's right.

87
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,609
I examined you
earlier, and it's going

88
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,378
to be sometime before
you return to duty.

89
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,415
It's bed rest for you
for at least a week.

90
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,250
KAKASHI: Guess
I'm not surprised.

91
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,352
TSUNADE: Looks like you
need a little more practice

92
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,055
before you've mastered that
new Sharingan of yours.

93
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,423
KAKASHI: Looks that way.

94
00:05:56,456 --> 00:06:01,161
TSUNADE: Anyway, you just
take it easy for a while.

95
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,163
Team Guy should rest too.

96
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,031
You can file your report later.

97
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,132
-Right.

98
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,567
-Let's go, Shizune.

99
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:08,501
Yes, ma'am.

100
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,236
-Oh.

101
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,037
M'lady wait.

102
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:11,438
-Huh?

103
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:18,345
-TSUNADE: What is it?

104
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,213
Is it regarding--

105
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,248
-Yes.

106
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,984
-So, have you told
Kakashi about it yet?

107
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:27,254
-Kakashi-sensei's he's been
out of it for a while, so no.

108
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,388
Not yet.

109
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,124
-How about Naruto?

110
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,259
No.

111
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,693
I felt it was better to
consult with you first.

112
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:37,497
-Tell me everything.

113
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:45,338
SAKURA: It was Sasori, one
of the Akatsuki, who told me.

114
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:47,607
He said it was a reward
for my defeating him.

115
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:54,514
-Go to the Tenchi Bridge in the
Village Hidden in the Grass,

116
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,617
10 days from now at nooon.

117
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:02,322
One of Orochimaru's henchmen
is working for me as a spy,

118
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:06,126
and that's where I'm supposed
to rendezvous with him.

119
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,460
However, I don't think--

120
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,167
-10 days at the Tenchi Bridge.

121
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,970
-It's already been
four days since then.

122
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:20,373
We only have six days left.

123
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,542
-Yes, but can you
trust your source.

124
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,344
-They were his last words.

125
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,479
I doubt he was lying.

126
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:31,651
-What if it's all a trap,
with Orochimaru as the bait

127
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:34,554
and the Akatsuki waiting there
in full force for whoever's

128
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,090
foolish enough to show up?

129
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,126
-If it's a trap, well
then, we fight them.

130
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,629
-Yes, but now Kakashi is
going to be out of commission

131
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,298
for more than a week,
and with only six days

132
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:48,101
until the rendezvous.

133
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,004
On top of that, Team Kakashi
has been undermanned ever

134
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,639
since Sasuke left.

135
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,507
-That's true.

136
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,243
TSUNADE: Your only solution
is to find a new member

137
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:00,580
and assemble a new team.

138
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,515
-Lady Tsunade.

139
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,717
-What is it?

140
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,119
-If that's the case, why
not deploy a different team

141
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,520
to investigate?

142
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:10,657
And even if you feel that
you must send Sakura,

143
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,525
Naruto mustn't go
on this mission.

144
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,198
-Shizune.

145
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,532
-M'lady.

146
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:23,103
-Like you, Shizune, Sakura
is among the few shinobi

147
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,572
I trust implicitly.

148
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,208
That's why this mission has
to involve the remaining

149
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,976
members of Team Kakashi.

150
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,345
-Wouldn't my team serve
just as well, m'lady?

151
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:33,380
Why not send us?

152
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,382
-It wouldn't be the same.

153
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:40,020
Sakura and Naruto, they're--
they're driven by a desperate

154
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,155
need to find their
lost teammate.

155
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,725
They've both pledged
their lives to rescue him.

156
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,294
That kind of desire
to honor their pledge

157
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:51,498
is why they will succeed.

158
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,433
That's where you and
Sakura are different.

159
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,105
-Yes, I understand.

160
00:08:59,105 --> 00:08:59,973
But still.

161
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,508
I believe that Naruto should--

162
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:04,344
-If he'd overheard
this conversation,

163
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,112
what do you think
Naruto would say?

164
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,252
-Well, I'd say we gotta find
some new teammates, that's

165
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:12,652
what!

166
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:21,361
See you.

167
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:28,168
TSUNADE: He's
always so impatient.

168
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:31,037
I hadn't even finished
my speech yet.

169
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,980
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Naruto's
got a mysterious power

170
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,251
that makes everybody
wanna bet on him.

171
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,087
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
To be Hokage.

172
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,188
That is my dream!

173
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,260
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER: The
boy who was entrusted

174
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,363
with the First
Hokage's necklace.

175
00:09:57,397 --> 00:10:02,218
Maybe Naruto really
is a special child.

176
00:10:13,774 --> 00:10:14,835
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sasuke.

177
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:48,647
-Hm.

178
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,683
Let's see, now.

179
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,685
Who would be good?

180
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:56,322
I've gotta think about this very
carefully, because after all, I

181
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,690
wouldn't wanna
choose someone who'd

182
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,325
end up slowing the team down.

183
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:00,659
That'd be terrible.

184
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,662
But, on the other hand,
it's gotta be someone

185
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:04,997
that we really get along with.

186
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,766
Otherwise we can kiss
our teamwork goodbye.

187
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,436
And with the way Sakura
gets goofy around boys,

188
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:14,707
I've gotta be sure the
guy's not too good looking.

189
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,843
This is trickier than
I thought it's be.

190
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,012
-Long time no see, Naruto.

191
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:20,579
-Huh?

192
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:25,417
Who are you?

193
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,493
-It's me.

194
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:34,894
-Hm?

195
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:49,074
Oh yeah!

196
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:53,879
Yeah, you're, uh-- Eh.

197
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:58,918
-I know it's been awhile,
but you should at least

198
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:04,323
try to remember your
friends, or else it just

199
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,993
turns the other
person's feelings.

200
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,862
-Whoa.

201
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,365
Wait, that voice and that
weird way of talking.

202
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,367
Could it really be?

203
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,068
Yeah!

204
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,803
Shino, right?

205
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:20,406
-It finally came to you, huh?

206
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,774
-How am I supposed
to recognize you

207
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,709
with your face
covered up like that?

208
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:33,452
-What's up?

209
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,487
You're early, Shino.

210
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,422
Huh?

211
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,890
-Huh?

212
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:38,490
Kiba?

213
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:39,758
That you?

214
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:40,359
-Hey!

215
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,001
Yeah, no mistaking that scent.

216
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,469
It's Naruto all right.

217
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:51,971
-You had to smell me first.

218
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,806
What's that all about?

219
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:00,012
-That dog isn't--
No way, is that--

220
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,314
-What do you mean?

221
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,315
Yeah, It's Akamaru.

222
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:03,949
Who else?

223
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,884
-Yeah, what?

224
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,720
-Man, look at you, Naruto.

225
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,621
You really grew, huh?

226
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,322
-That's nothing.

227
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,626
I hardly grew at all
compared to Akamaru.

228
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,461
It's hard to believe
he got that much bigger

229
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,329
in such a short amount of time.

230
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,031
-Did he really?

231
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,733
We're always
together, so I guess

232
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,435
I don't notice it that much.

233
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,004
-Trust me, he's bigger.

234
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,806
It wasn't that long ago you
used to carry him around

235
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,841
on the top of your head.

236
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,346
You remember Shino.

237
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:43,722
-You recognized Kiba right
away, didn't you, Naruto?

238
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:44,823
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Oh man.

239
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,726
Now he's mad at me.

240
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,061
[gasp]

241
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,443
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Na-- Naruto.

242
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,451
I heard that he'd
returned to the village.

243
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,956
What should I do?

244
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,925
I'm not ready for this.

245
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:24,897
After all this time, I-- I
wouldn't even know what to say.

246
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,799
Um.

247
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,567
Um.

248
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:29,835
-I thought that was you, Hinata.

249
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,070
What's up?

250
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,638
-What's the deal?

251
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,740
Why are you hiding back here?

252
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:42,314
Uh, Hinata?

253
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,049
Hey, Hinata!

254
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,984
Hinata, are you OK?

255
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,519
-What is it?

256
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,055
Aw, why does she always do stuff
like that when you're around?

257
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:53,726
-Please.

258
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,594
Our team's short one member.

259
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:56,762
We need somebody.

260
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,067
HINATA: Huh?

261
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,303
-Afraid you caught
us at a bad time.

262
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,338
We just got assigned a
new mission ourselves.

263
00:15:06,371 --> 00:15:10,976
As soon as Kurenai-sensei
shows up, we're on our way.

264
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,811
HINATA (VOICEOVER): What?

265
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:13,779
Help.

266
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:14,513
NARUTO: Come on.

267
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:15,614
You've got Akamaru.

268
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:17,516
That's like having
an extra teammate.

269
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,718
You can spare
someone, can't you?

270
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,720
Come on, Kiba.

271
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,957
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
What happened?

272
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,725
KIBA: You crazy?

273
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:27,726
I can't go.

274
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,727
Akamaru and me have
to stick together

275
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,963
to use our combo attack.

276
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,731
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
Now I remember.

277
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,834
I saw Naruto, and I--

278
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,370
-NARUTO: OK, I guess
you've got a point.

279
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:41,907
Well then-- then-- Well, Shino?

280
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,742
You wanna?

281
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,579
-I see you recognized Hinata
right away too, Naruto.

282
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:54,319
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Is
he gonna sulk all day?

283
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:54,953
-OK, forget it.

284
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:55,721
Forget it!

285
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:56,455
Some friends you are.

286
00:15:59,324 --> 00:16:01,093
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
That's his voice.

287
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:03,662
Naruto's voice.

288
00:16:03,695 --> 00:16:04,563
-Hinata.

289
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:05,664
Don't say a word.

290
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:07,533
Just come with me and
let's get out of here.

291
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,435
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Don't say
a word, just come with me?

292
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,436
No.

293
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:13,338
No, it's so sudden!

294
00:16:17,342 --> 00:16:17,709
-Huh?

295
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,713
I can't believe it.

296
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,550
All that fuss and
I still struck out.

297
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,322
Well, if that's the
way they're gonna be,

298
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,025
I know someone who
won't let me down.

299
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:33,992
-OK, Hinata.

300
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,060
Wake up.

301
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:36,762
Kurenai-sensei will
be here any minute.

302
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:37,629
We've got a mission.

303
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:43,569
Shino, you got any water
we can splash on her?

304
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:43,969
Shino?

305
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:51,877
-The sky is so blue.

306
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,980
-I'm sorry, but
like I already said,

307
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:57,549
I've been put in charge
of the Chunin exams.

308
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,619
It's a big, fat drag,
but there it is.

309
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,755
I mean, I'd like to lend you
a hand, Naruto, for old times'

310
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,058
sake and everything,
but these days, it

311
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,694
seems my time isn't
my own anymore.

312
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:09,595
-Hm.

313
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:10,462
-Besides.

314
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,030
The Fifth Hokage appointed me.

315
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,600
She'd kill me if I just gave
it up and went with you.

316
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,438
You don't wanna get
on her bad side.

317
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,007
She's worse than my mother.

318
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:26,845
-And here I though, least I know
one guy who's a heads up guy.

319
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,715
Good old Shikamaru will help
me, even if no one else will.

320
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,317
-Don't use those guilt
tripping puppy dog eyes on me.

321
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,919
I said it's impossible.

322
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,053
-You've got better things--

323
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,421
CHOJI: Hey, I'll help you out.

324
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,723
-Hm?

325
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,625
-Here you go, Shikamaru.

326
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:42,327
Your mom asked me to
bring you your lunch box.

327
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,695
NARUTO: Ch-- Choji?

328
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,096
Choji!

329
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,735
-What are you
talking about, Choji?

330
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,570
How are you able
to help him out?

331
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,971
Have you forgotten
the mission you're

332
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,574
going on with Asuma and Ino?

333
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,442
-Yeah, but he needs help.

334
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:00,479
I can't turn down an
old friend like Naruto.

335
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,413
Don't worry.

336
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:03,749
I'll clear it with Asuma-sensei.

337
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:04,583
-Thanks, Choji.

338
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:05,851
Thanks a lot.

339
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,053
-It doesn't matter if you
clear it with Asuma, because he

340
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:09,922
has to clear it
with Lady Tsunade,

341
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,024
and there's no way
she's going to say yes.

342
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:17,596
-Well, anyway.

343
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,964
There's no harm in trying.

344
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:19,698
Here.

345
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:20,933
Have your lunch box.

346
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:21,867
NARUTO: Oh, thanks.

347
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,872
-Uh, Naruto?

348
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,440
I think that's my lunch.

349
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,312
-Always eating.

350
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,981
Just like the old days.

351
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:41,320
Yeah, compared to back then,
you've gained-- weight!

352
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:03,976
-Behind you.

353
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,776
Watch out!

354
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,789
-Over there.

355
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,035
-I don't recognize him, but
he wears a Leaf headband.

356
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:32,037
-A sneak attack, huh?

357
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,306
I don't know what
this guy is up to,

358
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,675
but one good way to find
out is to capture him.

359
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,849
And hand him over to
the Interrogation Corps.

360
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,689
Go, Naruto!

361
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,591
I'll back you up.

362
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:52,991
-Gotcha!

363
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:09,541
-Ninja Art, Super Beast Scroll.

364
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,203
[theme music]

365
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,160
TSUNADE: Yes, Naruto
is a Jinchuriki,

366
00:22:02,193 --> 00:22:04,963
and I know it's a risk
sending him on this mission.

367
00:22:04,996 --> 00:22:07,799
If the Akatsuki gain control
of the Tailed Beast within him,

368
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,701
it could mean the end
of the Leaf village.

369
00:22:09,734 --> 00:22:13,037
But I also know that
Naruto does have talent.

370
00:22:13,071 --> 00:22:15,206
He will be a great
asset to them Leaf.

371
00:22:15,206 --> 00:22:17,408
If it turns out that I'm wrong
and the Leaf and the Land

372
00:22:17,642 --> 00:22:19,844
of Fire are endangered
because of me,

373
00:22:19,878 --> 00:22:22,881
then I swear as the Fifth
Hokage to protect them

374
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:24,048
with all my might.

375
00:22:24,048 --> 00:22:24,916
NARUTO: Next time.

376
00:22:24,949 --> 00:22:28,953
Formation, New Team Kakashi!

377
00:22:28,987 --> 00:22:31,890
[theme music]

378
00:22:40,665 --> 00:22:43,935
KIBA: Wow, it seems like forever
since last time we saw Naruto.

379
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,069
-Yes.

380
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:47,238
He's certainly changed
quite a bit, hasn't he?

381
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:48,206
-You think?

382
00:22:48,206 --> 00:22:50,775
Well, maybe a little taller.

383
00:22:50,775 --> 00:22:53,645
-Two and a half
years is a long time.

384
00:22:53,645 --> 00:22:54,846
I've changed too.

385
00:22:54,879 --> 00:22:57,382
I've grown a lot.

386
00:22:57,415 --> 00:22:59,784
Don't you think I
look more mature now?

387
00:22:59,784 --> 00:23:02,954
-Nah, you don't seem
that different to me.

388
00:23:02,987 --> 00:23:05,156
For instance, you still do
that nervous fidgety thing

389
00:23:05,189 --> 00:23:06,157
with your fingers.

390
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,926
-I do not.

391
00:23:07,926 --> 00:23:09,928
-Anyway, I'm the
one who's changed.

392
00:23:09,961 --> 00:23:12,730
I'm way more intense
than I used to be.

393
00:23:12,764 --> 00:23:14,933
-Actually, you don't seem
that different to me either.

394
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:16,234
-Yeah right.

395
00:23:16,267 --> 00:23:18,703
Well, the part of you that goes
all goofy when Naruto's around,

396
00:23:18,736 --> 00:23:19,837
that hasn't changed.

397
00:23:19,871 --> 00:23:21,205
-That was because it
happened to suddenly.

398
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:21,839
I wasn't--

399
00:23:21,873 --> 00:23:23,041
-Hi Naruto.

400
00:23:23,074 --> 00:23:23,841
-Ah!

401
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:24,809
-Just kidding.

402
00:23:24,842 --> 00:23:26,177
-Kiba, don't do that.

403
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,378
-OK, OK, sorry.

404
00:23:27,412 --> 00:23:28,112
SHINO: You guys.

405
00:23:28,146 --> 00:23:29,180
-Huh?

406
00:23:29,213 --> 00:23:32,016
-You should be aware
of my presence by now.

407
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:36,087
After all, I am a part
of Team Kurenai, as well.

408
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,789
-Oh Shino.

409
00:23:37,822 --> 00:23:39,958
-Again with the sulking.
