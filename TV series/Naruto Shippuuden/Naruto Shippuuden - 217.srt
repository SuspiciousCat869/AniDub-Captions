Oh yeah... by
the way, Kakashi

<i>...Who's she?</i>

5
00:00:21,786 --> 00:00:23,988
One of Sasuke's
comrades.

{\an1}<i>Was.</i> I'm
not anymore.

7
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:32,027
{\an5}I'm going to
take her back
to the village
to question her.

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,162
{\an5}Got it...
Back to the
Hidden Leaf
Village then...

What are you
talking about,
Kakashi Sensei?

11
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:43,270
{\an5}You said we were
heading home and
the Village is
that way.

12
00:00:43,303 --> 00:00:45,405
{\an5}We forgot
something in
the Land of

...Right,
Sakura?

14
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:48,807
{\an1}Forgot
something?
Huh??

on?

Oof! I think
I'm gonna hurl!

21
00:01:10,992 --> 00:01:13,527
What do you think
you're doing out
here, Naruto!?

22
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:16,363
You were supposed
to go back to the
Village with me!

23
00:01:16,764 --> 00:01:18,731
And you made
a hole in the
Inn's floor!

24
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:22,702
{\an1}Naruto...
Come on. Let's
get going.

00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,579

It was a clone
all along!?

28
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,351
[groan]
I'm so sorry!

29
00:01:43,786 --> 00:01:47,421
{\an5}You made me chase
you <i>and</i> apologize
to the Inn keepers
...again!!

30
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:49,156
[sheepish chuckle]

31
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:52,759
{\an5}Naruto arrived
here just in the
nick of time to
save Saukra...

32
00:01:52,793 --> 00:01:55,828
{\an5}...but I guess
you didn't send
him over to help
us out, huh?

33
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:59,331
{\an5}No! Of course not!
You ordered me to
take him back to
the Village...

34
00:01:59,364 --> 00:02:00,899
{\an5}...I wouldn't
disobey you!
Heh!

35
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,637
{\an5}I see. So basically
Naruto outfoxed you
and left you behind,
is that it?

36
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,137
{\an5}No! Well...
Uh...

37
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:11,107
{\an8}It all worked
out for the
best, Yamato.

38
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,677
{\an8}If Naruto hadn't
come when he did,
Sakura might be
dead now.

{\an1}It's different
than before...

{\an1}The Fourth Great
Ninja war.

What!?

103
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:19,754
{\an1}An allied
Shinobi force
has been formed.

104
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:23,325
We'll go into more
detail at the meeting.

105
00:07:25,426 --> 00:07:29,529
{\an4}Also, we're going
to need to set up
an audience with
the Feudal Lord.

a conference
with him.

Hold on...

108
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,367
Hey, Lord Bee.
What's that?

109
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,071
{\an4}A prize from my
fight with one of the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen
of the Mist.

110
00:07:39,738 --> 00:07:41,772

a liking to me.

111

{\an1}It never leaves
my side now.

112

the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen's blades!?

00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:50,512
{\an8}Incredible!
Just as
expected!

114
00:07:50,546 --> 00:07:52,014
{\an1}As expected,
huh??

I'm still at someone
else's mercy!

116
00:07:56,118 --> 00:07:58,019
{\an3}Mercy!

117
00:08:20,503 --> 00:08:23,740
(White Zetsu)
Well, did you
record the battle?

118
00:08:25,308 --> 00:08:26,342
{\an9}Yes.

119
00:08:26,376 --> 00:08:27,876
And Samehada?

120
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,279
{\an8}Eight-Tails
took it
with him.

121
00:08:30,312 --> 00:08:32,647
Oh yeah?
So then...

122
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,384
{\an1}Yes... It
went perfectly.

123
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,286
{\an4}<i>(Black Zetsu)</i>
<i>You've got to</i>
<i>hand it to </i>
<i>Kisame...</i>

124
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:44,223
{\an5}I will declare the
start of the Fourth
Great Ninja War at
the Five Kage Summit.

125
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,825
So, the time has
come, has it?

126
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:52,562
{\an5}Once I've declares
war, I suspect the
Eight-Tails freedom
will be restricted-

127
00:08:52,596 --> 00:08:54,932
-and he'll be
confined to
his Village.

128
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:57,700
{\an5}Then you'll be
able to hunt
him at your own
leisure.

129
00:08:57,934 --> 00:09:02,470
{\an1}I'm ready to
go after him
right now. But--

130
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:04,506
Infiltrate first.

131
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:08,676
{\an5}I want you to
sneak into their
midst and obtain
any intel you can.

132
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:11,644
{\an1}So, this is to be
an infiltration
mission then?

133
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:13,646
Use White Zetsu.

134
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,051
{\an4}Once he touches someone, he
can copy their chakra, and
form an indistinguishable
clone of them.

135
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,585
{\an1}Just leave
it to me!

136
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:23,088
But he's weak.

137
00:09:24,755 --> 00:09:26,924
{\an5}<i>(Madara)</i>
<i>He's useless in</i>
<i>battle but he's</i>
<i>good for deception.</i>

138
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,493
{\an4}You realize that
if fighting the
Eight-Tails gets
too exciting--

139
00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:33,495
{\an1}--it's possible
that I could end
up killing him...

140
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:35,197
{\an1}But I accept.

141
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,499
Good. I leave
the Eight-Tails
in your hands.

142
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:40,702
{\an1}I'm on it.

143
00:09:41,703 --> 00:09:45,305
I've been searching
high and low for
you, Eight-Tails.

144
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:50,543
{\an5}You see, my great
blade Samehada
simply loves
powerful chakra--

145
00:09:50,576 --> 00:09:54,612
{\an5}--and it seems to
have caught scent
of a very
delicious chakra.

146
00:09:55,414 --> 00:09:59,984
{\an7}I'm sorry, but I
must feed Samehada,
and you're what it
wants to eat!

147
00:10:00,284 --> 00:10:03,120
{\an7}(Kisame)
But don't worry,
I won't let it
<i>kill</i> you...

148
00:10:05,154 --> 00:10:08,991
{\an7}<i>(Kisame)</i>
<i>Now then, this is</i>
<i>where things start</i>
<i>getting tough...</i>

149
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:14,096
{\an7}<i>(Kisame)</i>
<i>It was good to let</i>
<i>Samehada take a liking</i>
<i>to the Eight-Tails--</i>

150
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:18,032
{\an7}<i>(Kisame)</i>
<i>--but I never </i>
<i>imagined it would</i>
<i>share chakra with him.</i>

151
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:21,568
{\an7}<i>(Kisame)</i>
<i>Luckily, that ended</i>
<i>up working in my</i>
<i>favor as well.</i>

152
00:10:22,168 --> 00:10:25,704
{\an7}Their Sensory-Type
ninja haven't
caught on yet.

153
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:31,242
{\an7}It's not surprising,
since Samehada takes in
Kisame's chakra and
uses it for energy.

154
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:34,312
{\an7}<i>(Black Zetsu)</i>
<i>So they have </i>
<i>the same chakra </i>
<i>signature.</i>

155
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:37,280
{\an7}<i>(Black Zetsu)</i>
<i>That's probably what</i>
<i>the enemy is thinking</i>
<i>too...</i>

156
00:10:37,848 --> 00:10:40,716
{\an5}But I could
have taken on
the infiltration
mission.

157
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,584
{\an1}You're too weak.

158
00:10:42,617 --> 00:10:45,454
{\an1}Ultimately, we are
going to capture
the Eight-Tails.

159
00:10:45,488 --> 00:10:48,289
{\an1}Kisame's the best
choice for this
mission.

160
00:10:48,323 --> 00:10:49,324
{\an3}Aww...

161
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,925
{\an1}But you pulled off
that performance
quite well...

162
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,295
{\an5}It wasn't easy
switching places
with Kisame under
water.

163
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:57,130
I'm really not
used to that!

164
00:11:06,237 --> 00:11:08,472
{\an8}<i>(White Zetsu)</i>
<i>Don't you</i>
<i>think you're</i>
<i>overdoing it?</i>

165
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:13,675
{\an4}No. I used just
the right amount
of force for the
Eight-Tails.

166
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:16,578
Alright. Well,
I guess it's
my turn now.

167
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,252
{\an1}Yes, the rest
is in your hands.

168
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:29,122
{\an1}Water Style!
Super Shark Bomb!

169
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,758
Double Lariat!!!

170
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:41,366
{\an4}<i>(White Zetsu)</i>
<i>I can undo my body</i>
<i>substitution Jutsu</i>
<i>now, right?</i>

171
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,966
{\an1}<i>(Black Setsu)</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

172
00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:47,970
It's almost
feeding time.

173
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:50,739
Come on!
Let's merge.

174
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:58,045
{\an1}That's what
you forgot!?

175
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,614
{\an4}I don't get it.
How can all these
guys just lie
around and sleep--

176
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:04,084
{\an1}--while you
were in such a
bind, Sakura!

these guys were
going to <i>help</i> you...

180
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:13,324
{\an4}...so apologize
to them after you
wake them up,
alright?

181
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,791
I will.

182
00:12:14,826 --> 00:12:17,127
{\an1}Wake them?
[groan]

183

{\an1}Oh boy...

184
00:12:20,564 --> 00:12:23,866
Naruto, it's my
fault that they're
all fast asleep.

185
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:26,801
So, please, be
gentle when you
wake them, okay?

186
00:12:27,035 --> 00:12:28,803
{\an1}Ugh, I'm
still sick...

187
00:12:28,837 --> 00:12:30,604
{\an1}You're going
to sleep too!?

188
00:12:30,637 --> 00:12:34,607
Listen, isn't Naruto
like this 'cause
--Sakura, isn't it--?

189
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,510

Next up is Sai...

I'm awake.
It just wore
off.

you?

your point, Sai?

Mark's really
gone... [gasp]

it than me.

{\an1}Yeah, that
Danzo guy...

us that Sasuke
killed Danzo?

But why!?
He's Hokage.

A Great Ninja
War.

complex thoughts!

you ever develop
a sense of humor?!

What's up?
Who are they?

293
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:29,978
{\an1}ANBU Black Ops
from the
Foundation.

294
00:17:30,012 --> 00:17:32,581
{\an7}It's as you,
my seniors,
already guessed.

295
00:17:32,614 --> 00:17:36,284
{\an7}The same reason
the Curse Mark
put on us by Lord
Danzo is gone.

296
00:17:36,584 --> 00:17:39,686
Then Lord
Danzo,,,
is dead.

297
00:17:40,087 --> 00:17:40,853
Yes.

298
00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:41,788
{\an8}That's....

299
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:44,590
{\an7}And his
bodyguards?
Foo and Torune?

300
00:17:44,623 --> 00:17:46,625
I have no
knowledge of
their fate.

301
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:49,260
They weren't
at the site
with Danzo.

302
00:17:51,162 --> 00:17:56,633
{\an4}Therefore, if you are
in agreement, I would
like us to discuss the
future of the Foundation.

303
00:17:57,234 --> 00:17:58,968
With the new
Hokage, here.

304
00:17:59,402 --> 00:18:01,137
{\an1}What!? The
new Hokage!?

305
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,439
Kakashi Hatake
has been appointed.

306
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:09,443
{\an1}We'll head back
before you.

I'm afraid that
I don't really
have a choice.

310
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:26,190
{\an8}(Raikage)
I'll get right
to the point,
your Lordship--

311
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:31,261
{\an8}--The Five Great
Shinobi Nations of the
Hidden Cloud, Hidden
Leaf, Hidden Stone--

312
00:18:31,294 --> 00:18:35,965
{\an8}--Hidden Mist, and
Hidden Sand, along
with the samurai of
the Land of Iron--

313
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:38,801
{\an1}--have formed
the Allied Shinobi
Forces...

314
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,736
{\an1}...I ask for your
approval on that.

315
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:43,904
{\an7}<i>(Feudal Lord)</i>
<i>But Raikage, Why</i>
<i>such haste?</i>

316
00:18:45,172 --> 00:18:48,975
{\an7}Rivals have always
existed among Shinobi
from different nations--

317
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:53,044
{\an7}--yet you want to
pull your strength
in a military
alliance?

318
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:54,146
{\an7}For what reason?

319
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,181
{\an1}The Tailed Beasts.

320
00:18:56,214 --> 00:18:58,082
{\an7}Tailed Beasts?

321
00:18:58,116 --> 00:19:03,387
{\an4}A group that's known as
the Akatsuki possesses 7
of the Tailed Beasts, and
has declared war on us.

Continue...

324
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:13,328
{\an8}The remaining Tailed
Beasts are the Hidden
Leaf's Nine-Tails, and
our own Eight-Tails.

325
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,597
{\an8}We have no
choice but to
cooperate.

326
00:19:15,631 --> 00:19:20,902
{\an7}Raikage, this isn't a
case of a retainer
wanting to supplant his
Lord, now, is it?

327
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:26,071
{\an7}Listen, your Lordship,
we don't even know if
we'll be able to keep the
Feudal Lords protected.

328
00:19:26,105 --> 00:19:28,240
{\an7}That's how difficult
this battle will be.

329
00:19:28,741 --> 00:19:29,941
{\an1}Hm?

330
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:39,750
{\an7}I understand, Raikage.
I approve this alliance.

331
00:19:40,383 --> 00:19:43,853
{\an8}Then I request that
you convene a Summit
of the Feudal Lords!

332
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:45,555
{\an1}You can't be
serious.

333
00:19:45,588 --> 00:19:49,591
{\an4}Arranging a summit
like that? Do you
know how difficult
that would be?

334
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:51,760
{\an7}Please, Sir,

335
00:19:52,928 --> 00:19:58,698
{\an4}Alright, very well.
Since I have no
choice... I'll do
as you say.

336
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,332
{\an7}Thank you.

337
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,738
{\an1}We have approval from
the Feudal Lords.

338
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:10,173
{\an1}Which means that
now we can officially
prepare for war.

339
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:12,609
Yes. I'll begin
all the preparations.

340
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:16,512
{\an7}I just hope that
all the other Villages
are starting to get
ready right away, too.

341
00:20:16,546 --> 00:20:18,914
I've got my
worries about the
Hidden Leaf...

342
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:21,282
...they may have
Hokage succession
issues...

343
00:20:21,316 --> 00:20:24,752
{\an7}And the Sand. The
Kazegage is too
inexperienced.

344
00:20:24,786 --> 00:20:29,957
{\an4}Don't worry about the
others. Just focus on
preparing our own people
for all-out warfare.
