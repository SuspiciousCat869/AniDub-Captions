1
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,164
[gasp]

2
00:00:17,502 --> 00:00:18,503
S... Sasuke?!

3
00:00:18,536 --> 00:00:19,504
Why?!

4
00:00:19,537 --> 00:00:22,073
[gasps]

5
00:00:22,306 --> 00:00:24,007
[gasp]

6
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:27,844
{\an1}You guys are still
annoying as ever.

7
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:31,947
{\an1}Why the hell are you
here, you bastard?!

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,181
He's right...

9
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:36,151
What are you
doing here, Sasuke?

10
00:00:36,984 --> 00:00:40,687
{\an1}A whole lot has happened.
But I've decided to protect

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,956
{\an1}the Hidden Leaf Village now.

12
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:44,190
Then, after...

13
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,058
I will...

14
00:00:48,726 --> 00:00:50,061
{\an1}...become Hokage.

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,634
What?!

16
00:01:00,335 --> 00:01:01,770
[chuckle]

17
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:04,072
All right!

18
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:09,542
{\an1}Team 7 is finally back
in action once again!

19
00:01:09,942 --> 00:01:14,045
{\an1}Sakura! Sasuke! Let's go!

20
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:16,404
{\an1}That sight sure brings back
memories! Right, Shikamaru?

21
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:19,474
{\an1}Well, okay. I guess that if
he's willing to help us take

22
00:03:19,507 --> 00:03:23,178
{\an1}down the enemy, I
won't turn him away.

23
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:25,179
{\an1}But I don't accept him.

24
00:03:25,212 --> 00:03:27,480
{\an1}It's been a while since
our whole class was together

25
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:30,716
{\an1}like this. Kinda feels
like the Chunin Exams!

26
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:32,985
{\an1}I'm the one who's
gonna be Hokage!

27
00:03:33,018 --> 00:03:34,652
Hey, are you
even listening?!

28
00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:37,622
Kiba, no one's
paying attention.

29
00:03:37,922 --> 00:03:39,789
Frankly, it's
pitiful. Quit it.

30
00:03:40,891 --> 00:03:44,059
{\an1}The reason is because the
impact of Sasuke showing up

31
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:45,995
{\an1}suddenly and declaring
his intent to become

32
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:47,495
{\an1}Hokage is much too great.

33
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:51,498
Um Kiba? Well, I
heard you loud and clear!

34
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,567
All of us should
aspire to be Hokage!

35
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:56,569
{\an1}Come on, you guys!

36
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:58,704
Let's show 'em
what we're made of!

37
00:04:04,675 --> 00:04:05,676
Sasuke...

38
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,379
What are you
thinking right now?

39
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,351
All right!

40
00:04:16,884 --> 00:04:18,387
Just hold up...

41
00:04:24,157 --> 00:04:25,325
{\an1}We have another one?!

42
00:04:34,998 --> 00:04:37,034
It wants to
break the barrier!

43
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:39,502
{\an1}Fellow past Hokage!
Please focus and

44
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:41,203
{\an1}prepare yourselves!

45
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:43,306
{\an1}Yes, we know that!

46
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:44,739
Now, then.

47
00:05:16,163 --> 00:05:17,764
{\an1}The barrier held!

48
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:21,801
{\an1}That thing's absolutely
amazing!

49
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:23,768
To be able to
keep him trapped!

50
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:25,837
{\an1}But where is Ten Tails?!

51
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,542
[angry growl]

52
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:37,313
{\an1}[chuckle] That Ten Tails...

53
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,680
{\an1}...it seems that he
scorched himself!

54
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:43,451
That is not just
some simple barrier!

55
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:45,785
{\an1}[impressed chuckle] Wow...

56
00:05:45,986 --> 00:05:49,621
{\an1}The past Hokage truly were
incredible individuals, huh?

57
00:05:49,655 --> 00:05:51,824
Seems they
weren't just all talk.

58
00:05:56,461 --> 00:05:59,062
Wood Style:
Wood Clone Jutsu!

59
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:05,934
{\an1}I'll make four entry
points in the barrier,

60
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:07,168
{\an1}so we can go in and out!

61
00:06:07,202 --> 00:06:08,702
Now, follow me!

62
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,738
Right! Let's go!

63
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:11,338
Yeah!

64
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:14,375
[angry growling]

65
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:18,510
{\an1}I'm not done! Sage Art!
Gracious Deity Gates!

66
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,479
Head Seal!

67
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:24,882
{\an1}[attacking yells]

68
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:30,719
{\an1}Now then, it's your turn.

69
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,789
{\an1}Sorry to keep you
waiting, Madara.

70
00:06:33,822 --> 00:06:35,023
No way.

71
00:06:39,926 --> 00:06:42,996
{\an1}A clone's no fun at
all. I'll wait until the

72
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,997
{\an1}real you shows up.

73
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:52,470
Quick, go now!

74
00:06:52,504 --> 00:06:54,505
{\an1}[attacking yells]

75
00:06:57,206 --> 00:06:58,508
[attacking yell]

76
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:12,419
{\an1}Those are Fission Beings!
It's trying to keep us away

77
00:07:12,452 --> 00:07:13,253
{\an1}from its real body!

78
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:15,387
[defiant roar]

79
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:20,425
{\an1}[attacking yells]

80
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,392
Don't hold back!

00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:25,728
[charging yells]

82
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:37,603
Yes... I...

83
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:39,238
I...

84
00:07:48,145 --> 00:07:49,413
Sasuke!

85
00:07:56,618 --> 00:08:01,222
{\an1}Demon Wind Shuriken:
Windmill of shadows!

86
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,939
Eat this!

87
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:27,142
[grunt] Let's
see you try it!

88
00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:29,143
Summoning jutsu!

89
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,049
Help!

90
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:41,919
[chuckle] Enough
playing. Finish him off.

91
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:47,090
Yeah?! Eat this!

92
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,759
{\an1}But how? It's impossible.

93
00:08:57,097 --> 00:08:59,600
Fire Style:
Dragon Flame Jutsu!

94
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:17,980
{\an1}That's right. Ever since I
was a genin, I thought I was

95
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:19,549
{\an1}a full-fledged kunoichi.

96
00:09:19,582 --> 00:09:23,552
{\an1}But I ended up hiding
behind Sasuke and Naruto.

97
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:26,120
And the two of
them always risked

98
00:09:26,154 --> 00:09:27,954
{\an1}everything to protect me.

99
00:09:28,421 --> 00:09:30,890
{\an1}I hated the way I was.

100
00:09:30,923 --> 00:09:32,925
{\an1}I swore that next
time, I would make

101
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,659
{\an1}them stare at my back!

102
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:37,728
[growling]

103
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:40,664
{\an1}Even I'm-- Even I'm...

104
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:43,534
Aaah!

105
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,935
{\an1}A wall of air! My shiruken
just bounced off...

106
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:02,713
I know I made
that oath back then.

107
00:10:02,747 --> 00:10:05,584
{\an1}But both Naruto and Sasuke
kept staying ahead of me,

108
00:10:05,617 --> 00:10:07,318
{\an1}rushing ever forward.

109
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:10,787
{\an1}So I gave up. I thought the
two of them were too strong,

110
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,423
{\an1}that I'd never be able
to catch up. But...

111
00:10:14,223 --> 00:10:15,723
Naruto!!

112
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:17,926
Sasuke!!

113
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,494
No, you guys!

114
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:24,565
Stop! No!

115
00:10:31,236 --> 00:10:34,205
{\an1}I didn't even think
about it. I put the entire

116
00:10:34,238 --> 00:10:36,207
{\an1}burden on you, Naruto.

117
00:10:41,077 --> 00:10:46,515
{\an1}I went crying to you, clung
to you, and expected you to

118
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:47,782
{\an1}make it all better.

119
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:54,387
{\an1}While I did nothing.

120
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,223
Sorry, Naruto.

121
00:10:57,556 --> 00:11:01,492
{\an1}It means you may have to
wait for me a little bit.

122
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:03,595
{\an1}Next time I'm coming, too.

123
00:11:07,296 --> 00:11:09,932
{\an1}I would like to be
your apprentice.

124
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:11,199
Hmm?

125
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,874
{\an1}[delighted laugh]

126
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,751
Take this! Cha!

127
00:11:42,023 --> 00:11:44,425
{\an1}Your movements are
getting much better!

128
00:11:44,891 --> 00:11:47,893
{\an1}By the way, do you
remember the first

129
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:49,228
{\an1}thing I taught you?

130
00:11:49,262 --> 00:11:50,496
{\an1}Of course, ma'am!

131
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:54,165
{\an1}Medic Ninja must never get
themselves killed. Thus they

132
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:56,101
{\an1}must never force their
way forward in combat.

133
00:11:56,134 --> 00:11:57,835
{\an1}Yes, that is true...

134
00:11:57,868 --> 00:12:01,137
{\an1}At the same time, that does
not excuse you from learning

135
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,172
how to fight on
the front line.

136
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,377
{\an1}First and foremost, you
are my student, a kunoichi

137
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,512
inheriting the
Legendary Sannin's power.

138
00:12:10,545 --> 00:12:13,813
{\an1}And Sakura Haruno,
you are also the

139
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:15,716
{\an1}Fifth Hokage's pupil!

140
00:12:16,216 --> 00:12:20,419
{\an1}And I just reached
full capacity.

141
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:22,120
{\an1}I can finally unleash it!

142
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:37,165
Cha!

143
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,037
{\an1}I am never, ever talking
back to Sakura or making her

144
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,905
mad ever again.
She'll destroy me.

146
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:57,747
{\an1}Wow, what monster
strength! It might even

147
00:12:57,782 --> 00:12:59,382
{\an1}be greater than Tsuna's!

148
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:02,984
{\an1}A continuous massing of
chakra over three years,

149
00:13:03,017 --> 00:13:05,653
{\an1}requiring extremely
delicate chakra control.

150
00:13:05,688 --> 00:13:10,023
{\an1}The 100 Healings Mark that
I couldn't even achieve!

00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:12,459
And I don't have
to waste any on a

00:13:38,144 --> 00:13:40,979
{\an1}I'm here, too! You know
that? Right, Sakura?!

162
00:13:41,013 --> 00:13:43,349
Look, don't drag
us down, Naruto?

163
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:46,017
{\an1}That's right! Keep
complaining and I'll just

164
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,086
grab the Hokage
seat for myself!

165
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,721
What?!

166
00:13:49,754 --> 00:13:51,455
{\an1}Not you too, Sakura?!

167
00:13:52,022 --> 00:13:55,157
We'll fight with
our backs together!

168
00:13:55,191 --> 00:13:58,394
{\an1}Lady Tsunade, it looks like
I've finally caught up to

169
00:13:58,427 --> 00:13:59,928
the two of them!

170
00:14:30,017 --> 00:14:34,654
{\an1}So this is how Nine Tails
Chakra looks under control.

171
00:14:34,688 --> 00:14:38,190
A new Sharingan
and black flames.

172
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:47,598
{\an1}That Naruto! He's even
mastered changing the

173
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:49,098
{\an1}Rasengan's nature!

174
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:50,600
[chuckle]

175
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,171
Sakura's holding
her own out there!

176
00:14:57,806 --> 00:15:01,074
{\an1}Come on, Team 8! Let's get
in there, too! We can't let

177
00:15:01,107 --> 00:15:02,509
{\an1}Team 7 show us up!

178
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:07,112
{\an1}I've managed to work out a
new jutsu for myself, too,

179
00:15:07,146 --> 00:15:07,846
Naruto!

180
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,748
Don't think you
have exclusive

181
00:15:09,782 --> 00:15:10,982
{\an1}rights to this jutsu!

182
00:15:11,849 --> 00:15:13,651
{\an1}Shadow Clone Jutsu!

183
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:22,591
{\an1}Shadow Clone Jutsu!?
You only made one!

184
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,258
{\an1}I could make way more!

185
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,626
{\an1}Even back in the day!

186
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:27,695
{\an1}Just watch, all right?!
There may only be one clone,

187
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:29,863
{\an1}but this'll make me
three times stronger!

188
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:31,297
Come, Akamaru!

189
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,967
Plunge into the
enemy's midst!

190
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:39,370
{\an1}Inuzuka Style! Man-Beast
Team Transformation Combo!

191
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:41,372
{\an1}Three-Headed Wolf!

192
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:43,173
[angry roaring]

193
00:15:44,007 --> 00:15:46,309
{\an1}[harrumphing chuckle]
Sasuke's joke about becoming

194
00:15:46,342 --> 00:15:49,378
{\an1}Hokage was nauseating.
But it's revving me up!

195
00:15:50,045 --> 00:15:51,312
[growl]

196
00:15:52,815 --> 00:15:55,683
{\an1}Tail Chasing Rotating Fang!

197
00:15:56,784 --> 00:15:58,452
[growl]

198
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:16,998
Parasitic
Gigantic Beetle...

199
00:16:17,032 --> 00:16:20,469
[angry roar]

200
00:16:22,837 --> 00:16:24,405
Infestation!

201
00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:31,477
Eww gross! What
are those things?!

202
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:35,613
{\an1}Parasitic Gigantic Beetles.
If you mistake the amount of

203
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:37,682
{\an1}chakra to give them,
they'll devour your

204
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:39,149
{\an1}flesh and grow rapidly.

205
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:41,952
{\an1}They're incredibly
tricky to nurture.

206
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:47,422
{\an1}Two Palms! Four Palms!
Eight Palms! Sixteen Palms!

207
00:16:47,455 --> 00:16:48,823
{\an1}Thirty-Two Palms!

208
00:16:51,992 --> 00:16:55,127
{\an1}I guess this really
is still my limit.

209
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:56,496
Not at all.

210
00:16:57,463 --> 00:17:00,098
{\an1}But Neji, I'm not like you.

211
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:03,567
{\an1}If you set limits on
yourself, you'll never be

212
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:05,536
{\an1}able to catch him.

213
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:08,938
{\an1}You have to surpass your
limits. You must fearlessly

214
00:17:08,973 --> 00:17:11,039
{\an1}take a giant leap forward.

215
00:17:11,273 --> 00:17:12,441
That is...

216
00:17:25,184 --> 00:17:27,218
{\an1}Sixty-Four Palms!

217
00:17:28,821 --> 00:17:31,923
...the trick to
achieving Sixty-Four Palms.

218
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:40,395
{\an1}Naruto is always striving
to get ahead. And I...

219
00:17:41,162 --> 00:17:42,664
[growling]

220
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:47,701
{\an1}...want to keep standing
next to Naruto forever!

221
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:51,170
{\an1}I'll proceed to Eight
Trigrams Sixty-Four

222
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:52,572
{\an1}Palms, like this!

223
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:56,675
{\an1}Thus, I must continuously
move forward as well!

224
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,011
{\an1}All right, come on
Team 10! Attack with an

225
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:01,946
{\an1}Ino-Shika-Cho Combination!

226
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:04,046
{\an1}We can use Formation E!

227
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,816
{\an1}[exasperated sigh] This
isn't the Chunin Exams. We

228
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,984
{\an1}don't need to compete
against the other teams.

229
00:18:09,018 --> 00:18:10,753
We're in the
middle of a war!

230
00:18:10,786 --> 00:18:12,754
{\an1}But we still wanna
show them what

231
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:13,755
{\an1}we're made of, right?

232
00:18:13,788 --> 00:18:16,823
Expansion Jutsu!

233
00:18:17,457 --> 00:18:18,659
Damn it!

234
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,960
{\an1}Shadow Grasping Jutsu!

235
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:38,272
{\an1}Twenty-five enemy
signatures picked

236
00:18:38,306 --> 00:18:40,341
{\an1}up and locked on!

237
00:18:41,442 --> 00:18:42,710
Sensory Relay!

238
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:53,384
{\an1}Human Boulder Yo-Yo!

239
00:18:57,321 --> 00:18:58,689
[attacking yell]

240
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:05,694
[attacking yell]

241
00:19:09,597 --> 00:19:11,665
I'm going to
expand some more.

242
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:13,633
Can you handle
some more weight?

243
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:14,734
No prob.

244
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:17,469
{\an1}You're still light, Choji.
And besides, this isn't

245
00:19:17,502 --> 00:19:19,237
quite flashy
enough to impress yet.

246
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:22,173
{\an1}What? Who's being
super competitive now?

247
00:19:22,773 --> 00:19:25,910
Actually, I'm
technically on Team 7, too.

248
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:29,311
{\an1}I'll attack the main
body from the sky!

249
00:19:32,915 --> 00:19:33,983
Sai!

250
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,221
Sai!

251
00:19:47,192 --> 00:19:48,259
You all right?!

252
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,995
Yes...

253
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:53,129
[growling]

254
00:19:53,162 --> 00:19:54,397
It's no good!

255
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,232
The number of
enemies keeps increasing!

256
00:19:57,265 --> 00:19:59,102
{\an1}And some of them are huge!

257
00:19:59,902 --> 00:20:01,703
These big ones
sure are heavy!

258
00:20:01,737 --> 00:20:04,538
[angry growling]

259
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:09,709
{\an1}Can you share your
chakra with everyone again?

260
00:20:09,743 --> 00:20:11,077
Not right now.

261
00:20:11,111 --> 00:20:13,912
{\an1}Kurama isn't done
recharging his chakra, yet.

262
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,446
[eager roaring]

263
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,684
{\an1}To take down the main body,
we need to mow down the big

264
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:22,452
{\an1}ones or find some way
to slip past them.

265
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:25,988
It's too far to
reach in a single leap.

266
00:20:26,022 --> 00:20:28,456
{\an1}We'll need time to
weave signs and repel

267
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,158
{\an1}the enemy's attacks.

268
00:20:30,358 --> 00:20:33,028
{\an1}Without your chakra,
Naruto, we could suffer

269
00:20:33,061 --> 00:20:34,328
{\an1}heavy casualties.

270
00:20:34,361 --> 00:20:36,696
And the Medical
Corps can't come here.

271
00:20:39,565 --> 00:20:42,467
{\an1}We need to mow down
and slip past, huh?

272
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:44,168
That'll be easy.

273
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,837
{\an1}This guy can clear the
distance in one leap and

274
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,472
repel any enemy
attacks, too.

275
00:20:49,506 --> 00:20:53,076
{\an1}I can now stay near and
heal anyone who suffers

276
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:55,544
{\an1}serious harm at any time!

277
00:20:56,078 --> 00:20:57,445
Summoning Jutsu!

278
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,939
{\an1}<i>You see that giant</i>
<i>way in the back there?</i>

279
00:23:00,973 --> 00:23:03,041
{\an1}<i>Can you get me closer</i>
<i>with some leaps?</i>

280
00:23:03,075 --> 00:23:05,877
{\an1}<i>I need you to just keep</i>
<i>advancing forward. I'll get</i>

281
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,179
{\an1}<i>the real body in the back.</i>

282
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:11,248
{\an1}<i>Lady Katsuyu, please divide</i>
<i>and attend to the entire</i>

283
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,449
<i>Allied Shinobi</i>
<i>Forces. Our role</i>

284
00:23:14,482 --> 00:23:16,085
{\an1}<i>will be to heal everyone.</i>

285
00:23:16,118 --> 00:23:20,021
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "The New</i>
<i>Three-Way Deadlock."</i>

286
00:23:20,054 --> 00:23:23,957
{\an1}<i>[proud chuckling]</i>
<i>It is a new era!</i>
