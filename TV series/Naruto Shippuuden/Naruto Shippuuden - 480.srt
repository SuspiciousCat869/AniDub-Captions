{\an1}Neji lives only for the sake of
Lady Hinata...

162
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:29,682
{\an1}That's the Hyuga destiny.

163
00:15:31,217 --> 00:15:34,917
Haaa!!!
(striking)

164
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:38,353
{\an8}Ahhh!!!!

165
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:40,687
{\an1}Good! That will do for today.

166
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:46,690
{\an1}Neji, you are indeed strong! And
Hinata, you still have a ways to
go!

167
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:49,692
{\an1}No, my father's daily lessons
are...

168
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:54,161
{\an1}I... don't like practicing...

169
00:15:55,028 --> 00:15:55,862
...taijutsu.

170
00:15:56,528 --> 00:15:58,363
{\an1}What are you even talking about?

171
00:15:58,397 --> 00:16:02,499
{\an1}You're the successor of the
Hyuga clan! You're very
important!

172
00:16:02,531 --> 00:16:05,166
{\an8}Neji:
You have to be more positive and
confident.

173
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,602
{\an7}I wish that I could switch
places with you, Big Brother.

174
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:12,669
{\an1}You're so strong...

175
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,205
{\an1}No, you must never say anything
such as that!

176
00:16:16,772 --> 00:16:20,106
{\an7}Now, listen! I will make you
strong!

177
00:16:20,141 --> 00:16:22,741
{\an7}If you're in danger,
I'll give my life to protect
you!

178
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:26,176
{\an8}Brother Neji!

179
00:16:27,877 --> 00:16:30,678
<i>Neji:</i>
<i>(gasp) Lady Hinata,</i>
<i>it's snowing!</i>

180
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:32,480
Ohh?!?

181
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,147
<i>Neji:</i>
<i>Today...</i>

182
00:16:34,814 --> 00:16:38,517
{\an1}...I got to have a snowball
fight with my father and I was
able to hit him twice!

183
00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:46,652
Ahhh.

184
00:16:57,225 --> 00:17:08,997
{\an1}(Bell and Chanting)

185
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:09,998
Hizashi...!

186
00:17:10,365 --> 00:17:13,833
{\an1}Neji's only four...
Oh, it's such a pity...

187
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:23,905
(Sighs)

188
00:17:26,173 --> 00:17:27,640
{\an1}Big Brother Neji...

189
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:44,315
(Sad Sigh)

190
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:01,856

<i>Naruto:</i>
<i>Hey! What are you doing?!</i>

195
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:14,792
Huh?

196
00:19:16,127 --> 00:19:18,428
{\an7}What are you doing out here in
the snow like this?

197
00:19:20,395 --> 00:19:23,196
{\an1}And if you just keep crying, how
am I gonna find out?

198
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,931
Ohh... I...

199
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:28,932
I...

200
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:38,137
{\an1}Listen... where's your
house?

201
00:19:38,404 --> 00:19:39,471
uhuh...

202
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,738
Oh come on,
now. Look...

00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,106
...let's go!

204
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:43,939
Huh?

205
00:19:45,474 --> 00:19:47,108
Oh!?!

206
00:19:53,211 --> 00:19:57,614
{\an8}HYUGA

207
00:19:57,646 --> 00:20:01,282
{\an7}Wow, look at this place! You
live in a big house like this...

208
00:20:01,915 --> 00:20:03,883
{\an1}...and you're out here
crying?!

209
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,351
Oh, uh...

210
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:08,619
I'm alone...

211
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:14,321
{\an1}I don't have anyone, but ú I
never cry. I mean, for real! I
never, ever cry!

212
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:17,823
(chuckle)

213
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,360
Bye!

214
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:30,429
{\an8}Hinata!

215
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,763
{\an8}Oh?!?

216
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:36,199
{\an1}You're the heir to the Main
Family! You're very important!

217
00:20:36,232 --> 00:20:37,833
{\an7}Just what do you think you're
doing out here?!

218
00:20:37,866 --> 00:20:39,133
Oh, I uh...

219
00:20:40,301 --> 00:20:44,103
{\an1}For your sake and for the
sake of the Main Family...

220
00:20:44,136 --> 00:20:48,071
{\an1}many people have made the
ultimate sacrifice.

221
00:20:48,105 --> 00:20:50,906
{\an1}It's about time that you
learned about such things
young lady...

222
00:21:00,645 --> 00:21:01,444
mmmm...

223
00:22:56,901 --> 00:22:58,369
{\an1}You'll surpass me.

224
00:22:58,569 --> 00:22:59,536
Impossible!

225
00:23:00,736 --> 00:23:03,037
{\an1}You're a lot like me, you
know. You do have the potential.

226
00:23:03,238 --> 00:23:04,871
{\an1}Okay, then! I'll surpass you!

227
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,207
{\an1}Sakura, aren't those bangs of
yours getting in the way? You
should just cut them off!

228
00:23:09,574 --> 00:23:13,042
{\an1}If you say things like that to
her, then Sakura's going to
start hating you!

229
00:23:13,243 --> 00:23:15,043
{\an1}(raucous laughter)

230
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:21,447
