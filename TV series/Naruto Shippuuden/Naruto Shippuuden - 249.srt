What?! What
do you mean?

{\an1}This is domestic trouble,
not a war against other

need for you to die,

115
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,769
in order to kill
the Nine Tails.

116
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,143
{\an1}Preserve what little
chakra you have, for your
reunion with Naruto.

117
00:09:09,911 --> 00:09:10,578
Huh?

118
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:14,650
{\an1}I'm going to seal the rest of
your chakra inside Naruto.

119
00:09:15,185 --> 00:09:17,153
{\an1}It'll be part of an
Eight Signed Seal.

120
00:09:17,787 --> 00:09:20,992
{\an1}And then I'll take the
Nine Tails with me.

I'm only going to seal half

[growling]

126
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:37,915

127
00:09:37,948 --> 00:09:40,351

<i>strategically unwise.</i>

128
00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:46,225
{\an5}If you take the Nine
Tails with you, there
will be no Jinchuriki
until he reemerges.

129
00:09:46,258 --> 00:09:49,262
This will upset the

{\an1}Huh? The what?

135

{\an1}In the future, terrible
things are likely to
befall the shinobi world.

{\an1}I know what you're
going to say.

140
00:10:22,974 --> 00:10:25,978
{\an1}But remember what
Master Jiraiya said
about world upheaval.

141
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:30,149
{\an1}And also, all of
the calamities that
would accompany it.

142
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,220
{\an1}I've become convinced
of two things today.

143
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:38,793
{\an1}<i>First: that masked man who</i>
<i>attacked you will bring</i>
<i>catastrophe to the world.</i>

144
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:44,435
{\an1}And second: the one who will
stop him Is this child!

145
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:50,343
{\an1}<i>This infant,</i>
<i>whose godfather is</i>
<i>Master Jiraiya,</i>

146
00:10:50,377 --> 00:10:52,979

<i>future as a Jinchuriki.</i>

147
00:10:54,248 --> 00:10:55,116
I know it.

148
00:10:56,117 --> 00:10:57,585
{\an1}Somehow, I'm sure of it.

149
00:10:58,552 --> 00:10:59,921
But, Minato!

150
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:08,700
{\an1}Reaper Death Seal!

151
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:20,681
{\an1}<i>[Minato]</i>
<i>Let's believe in him!</i>

152
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:23,920
{\an1}After all, this
child is our son!

153
00:11:24,487 --> 00:11:26,891
Those signs.
Don't tell me!

154
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:29,161
{\an1}Yes, it's the
Reaper Death Seal.

155
00:11:31,464 --> 00:11:36,403
{\an1}After I've completed this seal,
I'm going to seal your chakra
inside of Naruto, too.

156
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:42,844
{\an4}<i>You won't have much time,</i>
<i>but I want you to help him</i>
<i>try to control Nine Tails</i>
<i>power as a Jinchuriki.</i>

157
00:11:44,013 --> 00:11:45,781
{\an1}<i>But he's our son, Minato!</i>

158
00:11:47,884 --> 00:11:51,356
{\an4}<i>[Kushina]</i>
<i>...which is exactly why</i>
<i>I don't want him to bear</i>
<i>such a heavy burden!</i>

159
00:11:58,132 --> 00:12:01,369
And tell me...
Why use the
Reaper Death Seal?!

160
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:07,810
{\an4}<i>If it's just so I can meet</i>
<i>Naruto when he's grown up,</i>
<i>especially if it's only going to</i>
<i>be for a short time... </i>

161
00:12:08,112 --> 00:12:10,214
{\an1}Then there's no need
for you to die!

162
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:15,221
{\an1}<i>I'd rather you stay with him...</i>
<i>and watch over him...</i>

163
00:12:15,688 --> 00:12:18,624
{\an1}<i>I just don't understand why</i>
<i>it has to be this way!</i>

164
00:12:18,657 --> 00:12:21,362
{\an1}Why does Naruto have
to be sacrificed...

165
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:23,998
{\an1}for the balance of
power among Tailed Beasts...

166
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:26,802
{\an1}For his nation...
for his Village?

167
00:12:27,403 --> 00:12:29,873
<i>Why do you have</i>
<i>to sacrifice</i>
<i>yourself at all?!</i>

168
00:12:29,906 --> 00:12:31,675
{\an1}Just for me?! Please!

169
00:12:33,345 --> 00:12:36,282
{\an1}To forsake one's nation,
and one's village,

170
00:12:36,315 --> 00:12:39,719
{\an1}is exactly the same as
forsaking one's own child.

171
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:43,591
{\an1}Your very own homeland
was destroyed, so you
should know that.

172
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,465
<i>A harsh life awaits</i>
<i>those without a land</i>
<i>to call their home.</i>

173
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,636
{\an1}Besides, our family,

174
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,573
Is shinobi.

175
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:03,250
{\an1}Finally, even if I were
to live, I could never
be a substitute for you.

176
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:03,817
Huh?

177
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,856
{\an1}You won't have much
time with him.

178
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:10,459
{\an1}But there's something that
only you can tell Naruto.

179
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,629
{\an1}Something that I just can't.

180
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:15,133
{\an1}<i>That's a</i>
<i>mother's role.</i>

181
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:18,337
{\an1}I'm not doing this just for you.

182
00:13:19,038 --> 00:13:20,739
{\an1}I'm doing it for Naruto!

183
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,081
{\an1}I will die for my son.

184
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,886
{\an1}It is my duty
as his father.

185
00:13:39,297 --> 00:13:40,065
Rgh!

186
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:42,501
Lord Third!
What's wrong?!

187
00:13:45,305 --> 00:13:48,209
It's no good.
We can't get
in any closer.

188
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:51,113
{\an1}This barrier is preventing
the Nine Tails from escaping.

189
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,486
{\an1}Seems the two of them are
planning to take care of the
Nine Tails all by themselves!

190
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,030
{\an7}<i>Damn you,</i>
<i>Fourth Hokage!</i>

191
00:14:05,865 --> 00:14:06,600

00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:09,471
[roar]

193
00:14:12,874 --> 00:14:15,545
{\an8}<i>My body...</i>
<i>is going numb.</i>

194
00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:19,183
{\an7}<i>Can't believe how</i>
<i>heavy his chakra is.</i>

195
00:14:19,384 --> 00:14:21,152
[growling]

196
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,155
{\an7}<i>Damn you!</i>

197
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:28,228
{\an1}It is the Reaper
Death Seal after all.
I can't believe he used it!

198
00:14:28,596 --> 00:14:30,431
The Nine Tails is
still alive, though!

199
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:32,134
Couldn't he seal
all of it away?

200
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:33,770
It appears
smaller, but...

201
00:14:35,872 --> 00:14:38,475
{\an1}All right, now for the
Eight Signed Seal.

202
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:41,346
{\an1}<i>I'll seal the rest of</i>

{\an7}<i>Not inside that baby?!</i>

206
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,726

00:14:52,126 --> 00:14:54,028
[coughs]

208
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:56,566
{\an1}Kushina! Are you okay?

209
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,634
[big roar]

Dying for him
is my duty!

215
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,882
{\an1}Yes, but I'm his mother.
it's mine, too.

216
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:38,354
{\an1}There's a child
in there, too?!

217
00:15:38,388 --> 00:15:39,622
Yes, and they
saved it!

{\an1}[labored breath]

{\an1}I think this may be
the first time that
I've lost an argument.

222
00:15:50,035 --> 00:15:54,107
I Guess it proves
just how serious you
are about doing this.

223
00:15:55,343 --> 00:15:56,845
I thank you, Kushina.

224
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:04,921

<i>Yaagh!</i>
<i>The Nine Tails?!</i>

226
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,299
{\an1}And Lord Fourth, too!
What is going on here?!

227
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:17,037
{\an1}Gerotora, I'll give
you the Sealing
Formula's key.

228
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:21,043
{\an1}When I'm done, Take
it to Master Jiraiya
to store it.

229
00:16:21,812 --> 00:16:23,346
So that's it.

230
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:28,119
{\an1}Minato plans to make his own

00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:32,057
{\an1}I confirm I received the key.

232
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:33,793
{\an1}All right, I'm off now.

233
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:40,268
And now we're safe.

234
00:16:44,974 --> 00:16:48,278
{\an1}Kushina, I'm not going
to last much longer.

235
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:52,318
I'll start the Eight
Signed Seal, right now.

236
00:16:53,252 --> 00:16:56,823
I still want to put some
of my chakra in Naruto.

237
00:16:57,925 --> 00:16:59,827
{\an1}<i>We won't see him</i>

238
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:02,631
{\an1}<i>So let's tell him</i>
<i>what we want to say.</i>

239
00:17:03,131 --> 00:17:09,473
{\an1}Naruto. Don't be a picky
eater. Just eat a lot so you
grow up big and strong.

240
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:14,413
{\an1}And make sure that you
bathe every day and that
you stay warm, too.

241
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:19,152
{\an1}Also, don't stay up too late.
Make sure you get
plenty of sleep.

242
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:22,323
{\an1}Don't forget to make
friends as well.

243
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:26,262
{\an1}<i>You don't need a</i>
<i>ton of them, okay?</i>
<i>Just a few is fine.</i>

244
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:29,266
{\an1}<i>As long as they're ones</i>
<i>that you can really trust.</i>

245
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:31,602
{\an1}<i>And... heh...</i>

246
00:17:31,937 --> 00:17:33,705
Your mom wasn't
very good at this;

247
00:17:33,739 --> 00:17:37,544
make sure you study hard
and learn your ninjutsu.

248
00:17:38,077 --> 00:17:43,117
{\an4}<i>Always remember:</i>
<i>everyone is good at</i>
<i>some things and not so</i>
<i>good at others.</i>

249
00:17:43,652 --> 00:17:47,790
so even if something
doesn't go well, don't
get depressed, okay?

250
00:17:48,424 --> 00:17:52,931
{\an1}<i>When you're at the Academy,</i>

00:17:53,598 --> 00:17:55,935
{\an1}<i>Oh! Now, this</i>
<i>is important.</i>

252
00:17:55,968 --> 00:17:59,138
{\an1}<i>Regarding the Three</i>
<i>Prohibitions of the shinobi.</i>

253
00:17:59,606 --> 00:18:02,643
{\an1}<i>Be extra careful about</i>
<i>lending and borrowing money.</i>

254
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:06,448
{\an1}Take your pay.
Put it in a
savings account.

{\an1}No alcohol, not
until you're of age!

{\an1}Too much sake is bad for
you, so practice moderation.

257
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,697
{\an1}<i>And, another Prohibition,</i>
<i>is women.</i>

258
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:22,971
{\an1}Remember, I am one,
So I don't know too
much about it.

259
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:27,208
{\an1}Keep in mind, that this world
is made up of men and women.

260
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,848
{\an1}And so at some point,
you'll notice girls,
and that's normal.

261
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:35,052
{\an1}Just be careful, don't
fall for the bad ones.

262
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:37,990
{\an1}Just go out there and find
someone who's like me!

263
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,193
Oh, uh,
that reminds me.

264
00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:45,934
{\an1}speaking of the Three
Prohibitions, you should be
wary of Jiraiya Sensei ya know.

[heavy breathing]

266

{\an1}Naruto, I'm sorry to say,

267
00:18:53,076 --> 00:18:56,313
{\an1}there will be plenty
of hardships and
painful times ahead.

268
00:18:57,348 --> 00:18:58,583
{\an1}Just be true to yourself.

269

{\an1}Make sure to have dreams,
and the confidence to make
those dreams come true!

00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:30,137
{\an1}After all, you and dad
weren't around.

290
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,640
{\an1}<i>But still, I had a feeling.</i>

291
00:20:33,141 --> 00:20:39,082
{\an4}And besides, now I know
it for sure. Because you
and Dad both sacrificed
yourselves just for me.

292
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:43,287
{\an1}So now I realize, there's more
than Nine Tails inside me;

293
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,689
{\an1}there's your love, too!

294
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:46,591
{\an1}That makes me really happy!

295
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,695
{\an1}<i>Mom and Dad,</i>
<i>I'm glad I'm your kid!</i>

296
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:53,168
{\an7}<i>[Kushina]</i>
<i>Minato, did you hear that??</i>

297
00:20:54,202 --> 00:20:57,139
{\an7}<i>Our hopes really did get</i>
<i>through to reach our son!</i>

298
00:20:58,207 --> 00:20:59,141
Naruto...

299
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:02,145
{\an1}Thank you so much for
letting me become a mother.

300
00:21:03,781 --> 00:21:06,218
{\an1}And thank you for letting
Minato become a father.

301
00:21:08,387 --> 00:21:10,223
Thank you for
being born to us!

302
00:21:11,991 --> 00:21:13,060
<i>Thank you...</i>

303
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:15,029
<i>...so much.</i>

304
00:21:19,235 --> 00:21:20,402
<i>Thank you!</i>

305
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,767

{\an1}<i>Well, Guy? Why don't you</i>
<i>try it out for yourself!</i>

307
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:06,508
{\an4}<i>[Guy]</i>
<i>Don't be foolish!</i>
<i>We have to help</i>
<i>Naruto first!</i>

308
00:23:07,009 --> 00:23:09,980
{\an1}<i>[Aoba]</i>
<i>Are you just too afraid</i>
<i>to face your true self?</i>

309
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,850
{\an1}<i>[Guy]</i>
<i>What?! Okay then,</i>
<i>I'll try it out!</i>

310
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,821
{\an1}<i>[Aoba]</i>
<i>I have a feeling your true</i>
