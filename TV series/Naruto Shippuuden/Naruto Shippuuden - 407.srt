00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:04,374
Huh!?

148
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:08,178
{\an1}I just thought the
training would be handy.

149
00:13:08,211 --> 00:13:13,649
{\an1}Since she skipped out on your
Secret Jutsu training to come
learn under me...

150
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,956
{\an1}<i>If I can't sense them, I can't</i>
<i>get into Mind Transfer mode.</i>

151
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,260
{\an1}<i>So I'll have to contact them</i>
<i>both with Mind Transmission...</i>

152
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,698
<i>(Ino)</i>
<i>Sakura, Choji! Can </i>
<i>you hear me?</i>

153
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:30,700
{\an1}Yeah! I hear you!

154
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:33,971
{\an1}Ino! Can you do something
to sense the enemy?!

155
00:13:34,005 --> 00:13:38,142
{\an8}My Sensory Perception's
blocked. But their attack
seems to follow a pattern!

156
00:13:38,176 --> 00:13:40,311
{\an8}Yeah, I know!
That's obvious!

157
00:13:40,344 --> 00:13:44,015
{\an8}[grunt]

158
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:45,817
[grunt]

159
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,320
{\an1}<i>The enemy attacks</i>
<i>from our blind side...</i>

160
00:13:48,353 --> 00:13:52,391
{\an1}Right now, I can see Choji's
opponent when they're attacking.

161
00:13:52,424 --> 00:13:55,160
{\an1}But it's too late by the
time I see one coming.

162
00:13:55,194 --> 00:13:57,728
Thought so...

163
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:13,045
{\an1}You can communicate with several
people at once.  This is the
Mind Transmission Jutsu.

164
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:17,083
{\an7}Intel transmission is a basic
part of battle strategy.

165
00:14:17,117 --> 00:14:20,920
{\an7}As long as the enemy doesn't
find out, it's a huge military
asset.

166
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:24,057
Wow, Ino! You sure
learned an awesome jutsu!

167
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,292
{\an1}I guess...

168
00:14:27,427 --> 00:14:31,432
{\an1}Useful jutsu tend to be risky.
That's true for this one, too.

169
00:14:31,465 --> 00:14:36,403
{\an1}If you misjudge your level of
skill and carelessly increase
the jutsu's intensity,

170
00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:38,973
{\an1}in the worst case scenario,
you'll die.

171
00:14:39,006 --> 00:14:40,807
[gasps]

172
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:45,479
{\an1}By increasing the intensity, do
you mean widening the scope or
increasing the number of people

173
00:14:45,513 --> 00:14:49,383
{\an1}involved? 'Cause knowing that
would change our strategy for
using this jutsu...

174
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:54,955
{\an1}Yes. In the Mind Transmission
Jutsu the user's skill sets
its levels.

175
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:58,893
{\an1}Transmission speed, scope,
number of people in the
conversation,

176
00:14:58,926 --> 00:15:01,496
{\an1}all these change according
to the user's level.

177
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:06,568
{\an1}And when it's truly mastered,...
you're able to transmit the most
precious thing of all.

178
00:15:06,601 --> 00:15:10,372
{\an1}What's the most precious thing?

179
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:13,543
{\an7}What's held inside your
comrades' hearts.

180
00:15:13,576 --> 00:15:17,078
{\an7}The Mind Transmission Jutsu
can communicate that.

181
00:15:17,112 --> 00:15:20,483
{\an7}<i>On the battlefield, when you can</i>
<i>feel the intensity of your</i>
<i>teammates' thoughts for you</i>

182
00:15:20,516 --> 00:15:23,553
{\an7}<i>that gives you more</i>
<i>courage than anything.</i>

183
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:27,323
{\an1}<i>I've really only barely</i>
<i>scratched the surface</i>
<i>of this jutsu...</i>

184
00:15:27,356 --> 00:15:30,594
{\an1}<i>If only I'd spent</i>
<i>more time training...</i>

185
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:36,265
{\an1}<i>If only instead of spending time</i>
<i>studying Medical Ninjutsu I'd</i>
<i>trained more with Dad! </i>

186
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:40,571
{\an8}<i>(Lady Tsunade)</i>
<i>That happened because your</i>
<i>chakra control is too rough. </i>

187
00:15:40,604 --> 00:15:45,108
{\an7}You must learn to control your
chakra more carefully and
delicately!

188
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:48,445
Lady Tsunade...

189
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:53,350
Hey! Sakura,
Choji, listen up!

190
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:57,622
{\an1}But can you do that?!

191
00:15:57,655 --> 00:16:00,658
{\an1}Doesn't matter if
I can. I have to!

192
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:04,395
{\an1}I've gotta do more! And
raise my levels up!

193
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:07,432
{\an1}All right, here goes!
Mind Transmission Jutsu!

194
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:10,435
{\an1}I'll try relaying Sakura's
thoughts to Choji!

195
00:16:13,204 --> 00:16:17,610
{\an1}Got them! Now I just
have to send them on!

196
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:23,582
[gasp]

197
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,417
Yes!

198
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,355
{\an1}I saw something, but...  there
just isn't enough time!

199
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:32,124
{\an1}Transmitting everything through
me takes too long.

200
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:39,098
{\an1}I'll have to send Sakura's
thoughts directly to Choji.

201
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,700
{\an1}I'm not gonna give up!

202
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:45,104
{\an1}I gotta level up!
Gotta level up my
Mind Transmission Jutsu.

203
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:56,149
More... more,,,
more...! More...!

204
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,821
[grunt]

205
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:06,560
{\an1}<i>Now my thoughts this time!</i>

206
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:13,334
Gotcha! Cha!

207
00:17:27,783 --> 00:17:30,552
{\an1}But...  how...?!

208
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:33,722
{\an1}[heavy breathing]

209
00:17:33,755 --> 00:17:36,759
{\an1}How did-?! No way!

210
00:17:38,427 --> 00:17:40,562
{\an1}Intense feelings decided the
outcome of this battle.

211
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:42,498
{\an1}You still up
to this, Ino?

212
00:17:42,532 --> 00:17:43,899
Yeah! Of course!

213
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:48,338
{\an1}Good. Then let's finish
this together. Now.

214
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:49,272
Right!

215
00:17:49,305 --> 00:17:51,274
Wait! Hold on!

216
00:17:51,307 --> 00:17:52,908
-No excuses!
-No excuses!
-No excuses!

217
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:55,511
Ahhhh!

218
00:18:14,964 --> 00:18:18,235
All right, that
should do it.

219
00:18:18,268 --> 00:18:22,707
{\an1}We're in the middle of the
Chunin Exams and on
opposite sides, so thank you.

220
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:25,610
I'm a Medical Kunoichi.
This is what we do.

221
00:18:25,643 --> 00:18:30,914
{\an1}[laughs] Is it really
any wonder why all guys
love medical Kunoichi?!

222
00:18:30,948 --> 00:18:33,951
{\an1}Why are you spewing that
nonsense again, Choji?!

223
00:18:33,984 --> 00:18:36,654
[laughter]

224
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:39,624
<i>(Choji)</i>
<i>You're so cute!</i>

225
00:18:43,294 --> 00:18:46,464
Let's get going.

226
00:18:46,498 --> 00:18:49,934
But are you sure
about this, Sakura?

227
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:54,373
We're sure. We already
have both of the
scrolls that we need.

228
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:56,442
Just the water's fine.

229
00:18:56,475 --> 00:18:57,610
{\an1}Okay...

230
00:18:57,643 --> 00:19:01,814
Well, you sure beat
us, but still, we'll
get the scrolls.

231
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:04,316
and avenge this in
the Third Exam.

232
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,552
Hm!

233
00:19:06,585 --> 00:19:08,889
{\an1}I don't consider this
a victory either.

234
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:10,990
We'll settle it
next time we meet.

235
00:19:12,492 --> 00:19:15,695
{\an1}Your barrier against my Sensory
Perception was tough!

236
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:20,100
{\an1}No, we underestimated your
skill.  That was our downfall.

237
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:24,538
{\an1}Yeah, he's right! When did
you learn how to do that
kind of thing, anyway?!

238
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:27,641
{\an1}Huh? Oh, well, you know!

239
00:19:27,675 --> 00:19:29,509
[giggles]

240
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:33,046
{\an1}How's that saying go?
"A skilled hawk hides
its talons."

241
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:37,685
{\an1}I was Lady Tsunade's
apprentice, too, you know!
I wanted to prove it.

242
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:41,789
Well said, Ino! Thanks,
guys! we'll be going
in this direction.

243
00:19:41,823 --> 00:19:43,458
{\an1}And we'll go this way.

244
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,737
{\an1}The Yamanaka Clan's Secret
Ninjutsu takes finesse. I'm

245
00:19:55,771 --> 00:20:01,008
{\an1}sure the chakra control skills
required in Medical Ninjutsu
will come in handy with that.

246
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:02,811
Lady Tsunade...!

247
00:20:02,845 --> 00:20:08,750
{\an1}It may seem like she's taken a
detour, but trust me... she's
learning what she needs to.

248
00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:14,891
{\an1}And you, as the caring father
you are, must be well aware
of that.

249
00:20:14,924 --> 00:20:16,493
[gasp]
<i>In time, you will</i>
<i>surpass me...</i>

250
00:20:18,394 --> 00:20:24,934
{\an1}<i>In fact, I have faith that you</i>
<i>will become the foremost shinobi</i>
<i>of the Yamanaka Clan!</i>

251
00:20:26,102 --> 00:20:29,105
{\an1}Those guys were seriously
formidable!

252
00:20:29,138 --> 00:20:32,575
{\an1}I'd hate to think what
would have happened if you
hadn't been here Ino.

253
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:35,813
{\an1}Oh, no, don't say that! You two
bought me time, that's why we
won.

254
00:20:35,846 --> 00:20:41,652
{\an1}If you guys hadn't given it your
all, who knows what would've
happened?

255
00:20:41,685 --> 00:20:48,492
{\an7}<i>Dad, I'm sorry for skipping out</i>
<i>on my training.  And please</i>
<i>forgive me, Lady Tsunade...</i>

256
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:51,629
{\an7}<i>I thought that Medical Ninjutsu</i>
<i>was an easy way out. </i>

257
00:20:51,662 --> 00:20:56,601
{\an7}<i>But your guidance and training</i>
<i>in Medical Ninjutsu really</i>
<i>helped me grow.</i>

258
00:20:56,635 --> 00:21:01,205
{\an7}<i>The ability to make decisions</i>
<i>under pressure, more delicate</i>
<i>chakra control...</i>

259
00:21:01,238 --> 00:21:06,511
{\an7}<i>Everything I learned is</i>
<i>pushing me in the direction</i>
<i>I'm destined to go.</i>

260
00:21:06,711 --> 00:21:09,080
{\an1}All right, let's do our
best and reach the goal!

261
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:10,917
{\an3}Yeah!
