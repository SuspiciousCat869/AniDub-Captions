"The Complete
Ino-Shika-Cho Formation!"

00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:51,857
[growling]

3
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,765
You're wrong.
I'm not fat!

4
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,146
I'm just pleasantly
plump!

5
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:10,293
[screaming]

6
00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:26,527
[gasping]

7
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:34,576
Why?

8
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:38,450
<i>It's no good. Choji's</i>
<i>completely lost his will</i>
<i>to fight.</i>

9
00:02:39,653 --> 00:02:40,722
[grunting]

10
00:02:40,755 --> 00:02:42,525
But why, Choji?!

11
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,635
Uh!

12
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:48,904
Didn't work!

13
00:02:48,938 --> 00:02:50,708
Choji! Get back!

14
00:02:50,742 --> 00:02:52,044
Choji!

15
00:02:52,077 --> 00:02:53,213
[gasping]

16
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:55,484
Uh!

17
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:06,507
Ino Mind Transferred into
Choji. Quick thinking...

18
00:03:11,015 --> 00:03:12,752
That was too close!

19
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:15,323
Thank you for that Shadow
Possession!

20
00:03:15,725 --> 00:03:16,727
Mm!

21
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,572
Ino.

22
00:03:22,605 --> 00:03:27,214
When we were in Team 10,
all of us completed a whole
lot of missions together
with Asuma Sensei.

23
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:29,452
I know what you're
feeling now.

24
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:42,512
Believe me, Shikamaru and
I don't want to fight
him, either.

25
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:46,352
But because we know Asuma
Sensei better than anyone
else...

26
00:03:46,385 --> 00:03:50,260
... we can stop him with
the least risk to the
Allied Forces!

27
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:56,372
Choji.

28
00:03:58,343 --> 00:04:03,153
Choji,... you haven't
forgotten why we wear
these piercings, have
you?!

29
00:04:03,186 --> 00:04:04,488
Uh!

30
00:04:08,564 --> 00:04:13,106
That means all the
members of Squad Ten are
now officially Chunin!

31
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:17,314
And it also means that I
will no longer be in
charge of you guys.

32
00:04:17,347 --> 00:04:24,028
From here on out, you're
leaders in your own right.
Each of you will be given
a new team to lead.

33
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:28,269
These earrings are my
gift to you, to celebrate
your success.

34
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:33,714
Whatever the future
holds, never forget you
were members of Squad
Ten.

35
00:04:36,252 --> 00:04:38,123
And these earrings...

36
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:42,699
... are also proof that
each one of you guys has
come of age in your
respective clans.

37
00:04:42,732 --> 00:04:43,834
Uh!

38
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:52,552
All of you already know
the whole story behind
the Practice of the
Piercings, right?

39
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:57,929
All right, then,... Go
and present your earrings
to your clans.

40
00:04:57,962 --> 00:04:59,699
And when you do...

41
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:06,078
You'll be recognized as
full-fledged shinobi!
Now, go on; get going!

42
00:05:06,112 --> 00:05:09,018
Full-fledged shinobi.

43
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,959
But I... I just...

44
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:14,094
Ah!

45
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:15,430
[gasping]

46
00:05:15,463 --> 00:05:18,102
Fire Style! Burning Ash!

47
00:05:18,136 --> 00:05:19,840
<i>Ino, Choji!</i>

48
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:23,614
Choza!

49
00:05:25,852 --> 00:05:28,958
[struggling]

50
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:30,761
Old Man!

51
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:32,765
[gasping]

52
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:38,878
Which reminds me...
remember when we talked
about the king?

53
00:05:38,911 --> 00:05:42,719
Now I'm going to tell
you who the king is...

54
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:44,556
Lean closer.

55
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,535
The children who carry
the Leaf's future on
their shoulders...

56
00:05:50,568 --> 00:05:54,643
They're the ones who are
the kings.

57
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:58,551
And there's... just one
other thing to tell
you...

58
00:05:58,584 --> 00:06:02,057
Kurenai's pregnant with
our child...

59
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,961
[gasping]

60
00:06:03,994 --> 00:06:10,641
And so... I hereby
entrust you... with my
"King!"

61
00:06:14,683 --> 00:06:17,555
Snap out of it, Choji!
Stay focused!

62
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:20,661
We aren't some little
brats who need to be
protected anymore!

63
00:06:20,695 --> 00:06:26,005
We're the protectors,
now! Do you want Asuma to
murder his own child?!

64
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:28,109
Your idea of kindness is
wrong!

65
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:32,117
[panting]

66
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,988
Yeah, Shikamaru is right,
Choji!

67
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:37,127
Just remember the
piercings and what they
stand for!

68
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,666
Quit whining and pouting,
Choji!

69
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,406
Remember, you're the
sixteenth head of the
Akimichi Clan!

70
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,546
Akimichi Clan.

71
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:58,369
Um... let's see... the
symbol on the far right
belongs to us... the
Akimichi Clan, right?

72
00:06:58,403 --> 00:07:01,175
And the other two are,
um...

73
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:06,419
The middle one in the
Nara Clan's. And the
leftmost one is the
Yamanaka Clan's.

74
00:07:06,452 --> 00:07:09,926
Three clans that use highly
unusual Secret Ninjutsu.

75
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,932
We've been combining
our powers for many
generations now,

76
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,972
and the three clans
share a special
relationship.

77
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:17,742
Ooohhh.

78
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:20,313
To strengthen our union
and protect our clans,

79
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:23,554
the Sarutobi Clan bestows
ear piercings upon the
three of us.

80
00:07:23,587 --> 00:07:29,298
And every generation, the
members of our clans
swear an oath of loyalty
on those earrings, so

81
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:32,872
they're not just mere
decorations, son.

82
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:37,347
You mean these? I saw
that the other clan
leaders also wear them.

83
00:07:37,381 --> 00:07:40,588
It must hurt to get your
ear pierced...

84
00:07:40,621 --> 00:07:43,594
We wear these piercings
so the message sinks
in deep.

85
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:46,432
They constantly remind
us of the oaths we swore.

86
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:49,839
And you're eventually
going to have to have it
done, too, Choji.

87
00:07:49,873 --> 00:07:51,710
What?! But why?!

88
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:56,920
From the time my child
becomes a genin until he
or she finally achieves
chunin status, I am to

89
00:07:56,953 --> 00:07:59,491
follow custom and pass on
my piercings to him or
her.

90
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:05,705
It's a practice that's
intended to teach one's
child all about the oaths
that one day they'll take.

91
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:08,510
Yeah, but I really don't
like pain!

92
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:23,907
[panting]

93
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:27,147
Choji.

94
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:56,506
[eating]

95
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,313
You know... sometimes I
wonder if he'll be okay.

96
00:09:00,346 --> 00:09:02,451
[chewing]

97
00:09:02,484 --> 00:09:08,162
I'm worried that he's just
too scared. I mean, sure,
he did finally become a
genin,... but he always

98
00:09:08,196 --> 00:09:09,866
shies away from
confrontation.

99
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:14,909
Soon, he'll be sent out
on missions and may have
to face foes in
life-or-death battles.

100
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:16,646
And as it is...

101
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,322
... Well, to put it
bluntly,... I fear that
Choji will be killed
because he's too scared

102
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:24,361
to make a move.

103
00:09:24,394 --> 00:09:28,604
Frankly, I seriously
doubt that he's ever
going to become a chunin.

104
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:32,845
You're off base about
him, Choza. Your son is
not a coward. He is
simply kind.

105
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,985
Maybe, but in the shinobi
world, that's the same
thing.

106
00:09:36,018 --> 00:09:39,859
Then I say let him be who
he is. Let him be kind!

107
00:09:39,893 --> 00:09:42,765
Are you serious?! Be
kind?!

108
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,871
Yes. the kindness that he
possesses...

109
00:09:45,905 --> 00:09:49,979
...is a unique weapon
that he, and only he,
has.

110
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:51,248
A weapon?

111
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:56,358
He's just a boy. It can't
be helped if his kindness
is seen as cowardice.

112
00:09:56,392 --> 00:10:00,534
But some day, his
kindness will be a thing
of greatness.

113
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:05,678
The time will come when
the Hidden Leaf will need
the kindness that he
brings to the world.

114
00:10:05,711 --> 00:10:10,320
However, he's also going
to need to have strength
that can rival that
kindness.

115
00:10:10,353 --> 00:10:12,357
He needs to have the
intensity...

116
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,831
...to recognize, feel,
and accept others'
pain.

117
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:20,406
Or even reject it... but
still envelop them in his
kindness.

118
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,179
I know that boy has those
qualities.

119
00:10:23,981 --> 00:10:25,049
Asuma.

120
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,692
Choji is going to
experience many things,
both good and bad.

121
00:10:29,726 --> 00:10:34,401
This is the shinobi
world, after all. So
he'll have to face many
hardships.

122
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:38,877
But with each experience
he has, he will grow
stronger and kinder.

123
00:10:49,498 --> 00:10:52,939
<i>Choza! Please, come</i>
<i>quickly!</i>

124
00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:55,076
I'm sorry, but I'll be
right there!

125
00:10:56,813 --> 00:10:59,418
If you truly are
kind, Choji...

126
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,959
... There's no better time
to show it than right
now.

127
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:09,171
Or were my fears well
founded? Are you merely a
coward?

128
00:11:09,204 --> 00:11:11,610
Choji! It's all right!

129
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:12,778
[gasping]

130
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,921
[gasping in awe]

131
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,646
[blowing]

132
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,953
<i>You are a kind soul. That</i>
<i>is clear to see.</i>

133
00:11:49,986 --> 00:11:54,261
But must that butterfly
learn to live by borrowing
strength from you?

134
00:11:54,294 --> 00:11:56,833
[blowing]
Uh?

135
00:12:17,608 --> 00:12:21,015
From this day on, you're
a full shinobi, too.

136
00:12:21,048 --> 00:12:24,555
And now you'll swear your
oath upon these new piercings.

137
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:28,730
Eventually you'll raise
your own child and pass
these earrings onto them.

138
00:12:28,764 --> 00:12:30,133
[exhaling]

139
00:12:31,201 --> 00:12:33,205
What is it?

140
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:36,680
Do you really think I
could get married one day?

141
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:40,053
Hey, what kind of talk is
that? You don't?

142
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:44,428
Do you understand why
Master Asuma continues to
be hard on you?

143
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:49,237
Listen, I was able to get
married, wasn't I? Be
more confident!

144
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:53,379
I just don't think that
I'll be as lucky as you
were, dad...

145
00:12:53,412 --> 00:12:58,122
Times have changed. Girls
aren't as open-minded
anymore...

146
00:12:58,155 --> 00:13:01,930
Now, Choji! Time to swear
your oath!

147
00:13:01,963 --> 00:13:04,301
You know the words
already, don't you?

148
00:13:04,334 --> 00:13:07,040
Uh, yeah. I know 'em...

149
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:13,085
Human Boulder!

150
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:20,366
[struggling]

151
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,070
[growling]

152
00:13:22,103 --> 00:13:25,778
Even with potato chips, I
won't let anyone have the
last bite!

153
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:27,748
[gobbling]

154
00:13:27,782 --> 00:13:32,290
Well with an appetite
like that, at least we
don't have to worry
about his health.

155
00:13:32,324 --> 00:13:38,202
Hey, when I'm finished with
my breakfast, you're gonna
help me with my training
again, right Asuma Sensei?

156
00:13:40,974 --> 00:13:43,847
I've got--
[coughing]

157
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,024
Ino. Choji. Shikamaru.

158
00:13:49,057 --> 00:13:52,364
I've got something I
want to tell you three.

159
00:13:52,397 --> 00:13:54,000
(low satisfied breath)

160
00:13:55,504 --> 00:13:57,073
And Choji...

161
00:13:57,107 --> 00:14:03,452
You're a thoughtful,
loyal friend... and a
kind soul... In time,
you'll become a

162
00:14:03,486 --> 00:14:09,197
stronger shinobi than
anyone else... So be more
confident in yourself.

163
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,368
Got it.

164
00:14:11,402 --> 00:14:15,944
And another thing... you
might consider losing a
few pounds.

165
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:19,519
I don't know if it's
possible, but I'll try
to.

166
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:29,605
I guess... I thought that
I'd just change naturally
when I got older.

167
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:35,283
I thought... that both my
heart and my body...
would get stronger.

168
00:14:36,786 --> 00:14:40,861
So this is it, huh? The
war's about to begin...

169
00:14:40,894 --> 00:14:43,600
So we seriously have to
fight dead people?

170
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:47,006
But what do we do?! I'm
getting really scared
here...

171
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,250
Come on, Choji... It's
too late to worry about
all of that... now that
you're here.

172
00:14:56,058 --> 00:14:58,162
Oh, man... I'm
getting scared.

173
00:14:58,195 --> 00:15:01,201
Hold on. You boys
better not wimp out
on me.

174
00:15:04,776 --> 00:15:06,646
I'm sorry....

175
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:12,090
This is way too much for
me! I can't do it! I
can't take our Sensei
down! I just can't!

176
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:14,161
That's enough, Choji.
Listen up.

177
00:15:14,194 --> 00:15:16,900
I know you're a
truly kind person.

178
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:21,175
But right now, taking me
down is the kindest thing
that you can do.

179
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:25,383
This is the time for you
to transform your
kindness into strength!

180
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,320
Now is the time, Choji!

181
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,297
I thought it was just an
oath, part of a ritual.

182
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,973
Now I hereby swear...

183
00:15:37,006 --> 00:15:42,718
As the sixteenth leader
of the Clan I'll pass on
this oath entrusted to
me by the fifteenth...

184
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:47,595
...and I shall carry it
on unto the seventeenth
leader, my child to be!

185
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:09,939
Thank you, Ino. And I'm
sorry. But I'm okay now.
You can go back.

186
00:16:11,743 --> 00:16:17,120
In order to protect the
Yamanaka and Nara Clans
and the Hidden Leaf
Village, I, Choji

187
00:16:17,153 --> 00:16:23,465
Akimichi swear to
transform from a lowly
caterpillar to a powerful
butterfly!

188
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:25,403
And take flight!

189
00:16:26,338 --> 00:16:28,510
Choji!

190
00:16:28,543 --> 00:16:32,383
It's time... to change!

191
00:16:32,685 --> 00:16:34,120
Uh!

192
00:16:34,154 --> 00:16:38,462
He grew wings... without
even using the pills!

193
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:41,769
Uh!
[gasping]

194
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:43,807
Choji!

195
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,278
That's my boy, Choji.

196
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:49,752
That's what I was waiting
for!

197
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,027
Choji's slimmer!

198
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,968
Did he take a pellet like
the one he took a long
time ago or something?

199
00:16:58,002 --> 00:17:03,513
To my eye, it looks just
like the effects of the
Chili Pepper Pellet. Is
he gonna be okay?

200
00:17:03,547 --> 00:17:04,882
Yes, he'll be fine.

201
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:08,255
He didn't use the Akimichi
Clan Secret Calorie
Control Pellets.

202
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:10,326
He transformed all
on his own.

203
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:13,432
In other words, there
won't be any side effects
at all.

204
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:18,042
Was the shell of the
chrysalis harder than you
thought it would be,
Choji?

205
00:17:18,075 --> 00:17:21,783
But at long last you'll
be able to fly, won't
you?

206
00:17:24,454 --> 00:17:26,225
You bet I will!

207
00:17:35,677 --> 00:17:38,015
I'm going to go back up
now.

208
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:40,052
Got it, Old man Choza.

209
00:17:40,086 --> 00:17:42,992
I'm sorry Choji's always
been trouble.

210
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:45,363
<i>But that's</i>
<i>over, now.</i>

211
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,302
He is now...

212
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:52,511
...truly worthy of being
the sixteenth Akimichi
Clan leader.

213
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:59,792
We can handle Asuma from
here on out. Please take
care of the rest, old
man!

214
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:08,242
Do it!

215
00:18:08,275 --> 00:18:10,446
Weaken him, then get him
over here!

216
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:15,557
You're sure good at
barking out orders from a
distance. We need to get
in there and help, too!

217
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,258
Shut it!

218
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,493
Uh!

219
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:21,468
Well, that's the Sealing
Corps for you! Like it's
gonna be that simple!

220
00:18:22,303 --> 00:18:24,976
Shikamaru! Get my back!

221
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:27,280
You got it. Go, Ino! Now!

222
00:18:27,313 --> 00:18:29,619
Mind Transfer Clone
Jutsu!

223
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:42,978
My turn...

224
00:18:43,012 --> 00:18:44,815
Shadow Stitching Jutsu!

225
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:52,965
There's no way for me to
counter this one.

226
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:55,504
Very nicely done, there,
Choji!

227
00:19:04,254 --> 00:19:06,859
That's what I want to
see.

228
00:19:06,893 --> 00:19:12,036
Keep it up... and you'll
be the strongest of them
all.

229
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:17,648
Right now, you have the
look of someone who has
all the confidence that
he'll ever need!

230
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:18,550
Ah!

231
00:19:19,985 --> 00:19:21,488
Choji!

232
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,310
You stopped me with my
own weapon. That's very
impressive.

233
00:19:32,343 --> 00:19:34,882
I'm moved and yet I
can't move.

234
00:19:34,915 --> 00:19:39,157
It's Shadow Possession
Shuriken Jutsu. That's
the reason why you can't
move now.

235
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,365
All right, you guys! You
can just leave the rest
of this to the Sealing
Corps.

236
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:45,704
Could you please wait
just a moment more?

237
00:19:45,737 --> 00:19:47,040
Are you kidding me?!

238
00:19:47,073 --> 00:19:50,146
We already heard your
last words once before.

239
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:54,187
Are you really going to
put us through that
again?

240
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:00,534
But there's just one more
thing that I couldn't
tell you... the last time
that I spoke them.

241
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:05,677
And it's simply this:
That I have nothing left
to say to you.

242
00:20:05,711 --> 00:20:09,719
Your Ino-Shika-Cho
formation is complete.

243
00:20:12,023 --> 00:20:13,560
[smiling]

244
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,372
Sensei.

245
00:20:22,544 --> 00:20:23,847
Asuma.

246
00:20:24,548 --> 00:20:26,251
Asuma Sensei.

247
00:20:28,188 --> 00:20:29,592
<i>Thank you.</i>

248
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:37,674
[screaming]

249
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,240
What's goin' on?

250
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,601
I'm going to end this
entire battle right now.

251
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:12,243
But I'll need you,
Shikamaru and Ino. So
please help me out, okay?

252
00:21:12,276 --> 00:21:13,680
You got it!

253
00:21:13,713 --> 00:21:17,353
Y'know, Choji... I've
known you practically
forever, now...

254
00:21:17,386 --> 00:21:19,959
But I've never seen you
take charge like this!

255
00:22:59,825 --> 00:23:02,798
Naruto, I'm sorry, but I
cannot let you get by.

256
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:06,939
<i>Why are there so many</i>
<i>guards? Why are all you</i>
<i>guys watching me?</i>

257
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:09,878
Enough! Just go inside.
We'll talk there.

258
00:23:09,912 --> 00:23:13,753
<i>I don't see why you can't</i>
<i>tell me out here. Why</i>
<i>can't I go outside?</i>

259
00:23:13,786 --> 00:23:15,289
<i>Naruto!</i>

260
00:23:15,322 --> 00:23:18,730
<i>Wait, hold on. What are</i>
<i>you doing here on this</i>
<i>island?!</i>

261
00:23:18,763 --> 00:23:23,472
<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: A Message from</i>
<i>the Heart.</i>

262
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:26,044
<i>Why? Tell me why!</i>
