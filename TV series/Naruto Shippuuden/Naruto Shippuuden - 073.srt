1
00:00:15,193 --> 00:00:16,034
-Eh!

2
00:00:16,044 --> 00:00:18,067
Ah, Zetsu.

3
00:00:18,077 --> 00:00:20,230
-So it's done.

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,166
Have you finished your
long-winded ritual?

5
00:00:24,176 --> 00:00:27,331
--[grunts] Aw, don't tell me,
you're going to start now, too?

6
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:31,116
I'm surrounded by blasphemers
and ignorant heathens.

7
00:00:31,126 --> 00:00:33,340
-Sorrow begets solitude.

8
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:37,205
The only thing you can
have faith in yourself.

9
00:00:37,215 --> 00:00:38,317
KAKUZU: You're wrong.

10
00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:42,253
The only thing you can
have faith in is money.

11
00:00:42,263 --> 00:00:43,314
-There you go again.

12
00:00:43,324 --> 00:00:46,179
This side job of yours
has made us fall behind

13
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:48,172
in our Jinchuriki hunt.

14
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:49,243
And that's not all.

15
00:00:49,253 --> 00:00:51,286
-Listen, I only
teamed up with you

16
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:54,161
because you said
religion was profitable.

17
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:56,234
As holder of the
Akatsuki's purse strings,

18
00:00:56,244 --> 00:00:58,347
I'm the one who
should be complaining.

19
00:00:58,357 --> 00:01:01,171
-Money is indeed important.

20
00:01:01,181 --> 00:01:04,256
More important is that
you two stop wasting time

21
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:06,299
and get on with the hunt.

22
00:01:06,309 --> 00:01:08,392
Leave the Two Tails to me.

23
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,232
-You sure you're ready for this?

24
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,205
You just got out of
the hospital yesterday.

25
00:01:17,215 --> 00:01:20,219
-Nah, that whole thing was
blown out of proportion.

26
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:21,301
-So you're good to go.

27
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:23,274
Full speed ahead, right?

28
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:25,247
That's what you'd like
to think, at least.

29
00:01:25,257 --> 00:01:27,390
But first, let's
go over the basics.

30
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,341
-Forget that!

31
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:30,154
Come on!

32
00:01:30,164 --> 00:01:33,159
Let's skip to the part where I
work on my new, killer jutsu!

33
00:01:33,169 --> 00:01:34,290
-Mm.

34
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,225
-You know, the super secret,
deluxe, special Naruto Uzumaki

35
00:01:37,235 --> 00:01:40,299
Rasengan, or
whatever it's called.

36
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,261
-Uh.

37
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:43,183
-Oh boy.

38
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:46,308
-Before that, let's review
the change in chakra nature,

39
00:01:46,318 --> 00:01:47,320
all right?

40
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,284
Fire, Water, Wind,
Lightning, and Earth

41
00:01:50,294 --> 00:01:52,177
are the five chakra natures.

42
00:01:52,187 --> 00:01:53,389
And in your case--
-I know.

43
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,403
I've got a wind chakra nature.

44
00:01:56,413 --> 00:01:57,465
-OK.

45
00:01:58,176 --> 00:01:59,458
Just show us you remember
what we've done so far.

46
00:01:59,468 --> 00:02:00,389
-Right.

47
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,202
Multi-shadow Clone Jutsu!

48
00:02:06,258 --> 00:02:07,389
Uh!

49
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:09,282
[exhales]

50
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:10,274
OK.

51
00:02:10,284 --> 00:02:12,357
Finely and sharply,
that's the key!

52
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:13,348
Uh!

53
00:02:13,358 --> 00:02:16,323
[all clones copying]

54
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:27,229
Huh? (ALL TOGETHER) We did it!

55
00:02:30,294 --> 00:02:31,265
Well?

56
00:02:31,275 --> 00:02:32,357
What do you think
Kakashi-sensei?

57
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:35,301
Not bad, huh?

58
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:36,423
Uh, (WEAKLY) I think.

59
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:48,410
-Good grief.

60
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,256
He's always pushing it,
even when he's not 100%.

61
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:53,448
-The multi-shadow
clones were helpful

62
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,392
before as a way of
accelerating the training time,

63
00:02:56,402 --> 00:02:58,405
but there's no need for
him to knock himself

64
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:00,458
out using them now.

65
00:03:00,468 --> 00:03:04,444
KAKASHI: Naruto likes to
do things in a big way.

66
00:03:04,454 --> 00:03:07,569
[theme music]

67
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:55,720
-How much farther is this place?

68
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,663
KAKUZU: We're almost there.

69
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,455
-[scoffs] Yeah, right.

70
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:03,521
That's what you keep
saying, but-- Uh.

71
00:05:03,531 --> 00:05:04,693
You're kidding!

72
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:06,506
More climbing?

73
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:08,589
There'd better be a
Jinchuriki at the end of this,

74
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,472
because if there's
not, I'll get mad.

75
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:11,653
And you know what
happens when I get--

76
00:05:11,663 --> 00:05:13,566
KAKUZU: I don't give
a damn what happens.

77
00:05:13,576 --> 00:05:17,622
And if you don't stop
whining like a spoiled brat,

78
00:05:17,632 --> 00:05:19,565
I'll kill you.

79
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:20,667
-Oh, come on.

80
00:05:20,677 --> 00:05:21,688
What's that about?

81
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:25,494
You trying to scare me or what?

82
00:05:25,504 --> 00:05:32,494
[huffs] You really are an
antisocial jerk, you know that?

83
00:05:32,504 --> 00:05:35,539
-So putting aside any
variables that might arise,

84
00:05:35,549 --> 00:05:37,792
you feel this is the best
assessment of the situation?

85
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:39,665
SHIZUNE: Yes.

86
00:05:39,675 --> 00:05:41,728
TSUNADE: Put it all in order
within two or three days

87
00:05:41,738 --> 00:05:43,601
and have it ready
for distribution.

88
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:44,713
I'm counting on you.

89
00:05:44,723 --> 00:05:45,664
-Understood, M'lady.

90
00:05:52,574 --> 00:05:54,667
-(THINKING) Sorry to put
you through this, Shizune.

91
00:05:54,677 --> 00:05:56,751
But we can't just sit
around and do nothing.

92
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,752
KAKASHI: Welcome back.

93
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:08,758
-Was I-- Did I
fall asleep again?

94
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,603
KAKASHI: You need your rest.

95
00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:13,646
That multi-shadow clone
method of training

96
00:06:13,656 --> 00:06:16,670
can really wear
you out, can't it?

97
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,775
Why don't we resume after
you've rested a bit more.

98
00:06:19,785 --> 00:06:21,788
-What'll the next step be?

99
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,742
-The next step?

100
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:30,671
The next step will be
to cut that waterfall.

101
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,793
-Wh-what?

102
00:06:31,803 --> 00:06:34,617
-Press your hands to the
water and cut the flow

103
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,590
by slamming it with wind chakra.

104
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,842
-C-cut the flow?

105
00:06:37,852 --> 00:06:39,714
But it's a waterfall!

106
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:40,716
-That's right.

107
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:42,819
And that means in
order to be successful,

108
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:45,884
you'll need a large amount
of change in chakra nature.

109
00:06:45,894 --> 00:06:47,776
KAKASHI: If you're
able to pull it off,

110
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:50,711
it's something you'll always
be able to use in battle.

111
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:51,822
-Uh.

112
00:06:51,832 --> 00:06:55,698
Kakashi-sensei, are you guys
saying if I can pull this off,

113
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,851
I'll have achieved my first
change in chakra nature?

114
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:59,674
-Mm-hm.

115
00:06:59,684 --> 00:07:00,756
-Excellent!

116
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:03,730
So I'm getting even
better than I thought!

117
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,883
-(THINKING) I never could have
imagined that clumsy little

118
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:09,889
Naruto would achieve change
in chakra nature so quickly.

119
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:12,874
This training method
was a brilliant success,

120
00:07:12,884 --> 00:07:14,777
if I do say so myself.

121
00:07:14,787 --> 00:07:15,788
-OK.

122
00:07:15,798 --> 00:07:16,780
Break time's over.

123
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,821
Let's get back to training!

124
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,751
YAMATO: Wood-style Jutsu!

125
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:36,849
KAKASHI: That will be
your training area.

126
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:37,891
-Got it!

127
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:38,772
KAKASHI: Whoa!

128
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:39,774
Not so fast.

129
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:40,915
-Huh? Why?

130
00:07:40,925 --> 00:07:42,688
What is it?

131
00:07:42,698 --> 00:07:43,910
KAKASHI: You're going to
need Yamato's chakra control

132
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,973
at all times during
this exercise.

133
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:47,926
He's in your hands, Yamato.

134
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:48,777
-Right.

135
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,813
Hup!

136
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:12,773
Ah, ho!

137
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:22,958
I'm ready when you are, Naruto.

138
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:24,881
-Multi-shadow Clone Jutsu!

139
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:43,048
(THINKING) I've got to form
a mental picture of the wind chakra.

140
00:08:46,954 --> 00:08:48,015
-Now listen up.

141
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:51,020
To activate it, imagine
your chakra splitting in two

142
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,023
and grinding against each other.

143
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,966
-Grinding them?

144
00:08:54,976 --> 00:08:56,949
-Just as if you were
finely sharpening

145
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,923
the blade between the two
halves of your chakra.

146
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:03,909
-Sharpening the blade
between the two halves, huh?

147
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,920
-Exactly.

148
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,815
Finely and sharply,
that's the trick.

149
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,113
-Finely and sharply!

150
00:09:13,824 --> 00:09:15,827
OK. Let's do it.

151
00:09:15,837 --> 00:09:17,980
Right!
Hup!

152
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:22,837
Ugh!

153
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:24,039
What is going on here?

154
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:25,010
Cut the flow?

155
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,013
We can't even budge it.

156
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:27,885
Come on.

157
00:09:27,895 --> 00:09:28,986
Let's try again!

158
00:09:28,996 --> 00:09:30,048
All right.

159
00:09:30,058 --> 00:09:30,899
Hup!

160
00:09:34,004 --> 00:09:37,128
-As we expected, this will
probably take a while, huh?

161
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:42,897
-Nothing we can
do but be patient.

162
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,035
-Hup!

163
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:57,178
Hup!

164
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,447
Hup!

165
00:10:10,037 --> 00:10:12,120
-I think that's
Everything I need.

166
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,923
Yup.

167
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:17,178
Now I can make some of my own
special Sakura food pills.

168
00:10:17,188 --> 00:10:19,211
If I know Naruto and the
way he pushes himself,

169
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:21,700
he's going to need them.

170
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:25,200
(THINKING) That idiot.

171
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,965
He doesn't understand that
willpower is enough anymore.

172
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:30,998
If he's not physically
ready for it,

173
00:10:31,008 --> 00:10:32,951
this training could
have the reverse effect

174
00:10:32,961 --> 00:10:35,094
of what's intended.

175
00:10:35,105 --> 00:10:38,059
On top of that, because
of his special abilities,

176
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:43,046
he's always in danger of
pushing it to the limit anyway.

177
00:10:43,056 --> 00:10:46,171
I've just got to do
whatever I can to help him.

178
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:05,079
-Hup!

179
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:07,072
Hup!

180
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:08,214
Hup!

181
00:11:08,224 --> 00:11:09,065
Hup!

182
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,047
[panting]

183
00:11:17,057 --> 00:11:23,046
[gasps] Ahh!

184
00:11:23,056 --> 00:11:25,179
Huh!

185
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:27,162
Hup!

186
00:11:27,172 --> 00:11:29,165
Hup!

187
00:11:29,175 --> 00:11:31,288
Hup!

188
00:11:31,298 --> 00:11:33,191
Darn it.

189
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:35,134
Darn it!

190
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:36,265
Hup!

191
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:38,088
Hup!

192
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,476
Hup!

193
00:11:42,174 --> 00:11:45,239
-(THINKING) He'll probably start
losing his patience right about

194
00:11:45,249 --> 00:11:48,173
now.

195
00:11:48,183 --> 00:11:50,106
HIDAN: [sighs] A temple?

196
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:53,090
Are you sure this
is the right place?

197
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,285
KAKUZU: We'll see this
is no ordinary temple,

198
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:58,208
so the odds are good.

199
00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:14,222
-What's going on?

200
00:12:14,232 --> 00:12:16,235
-Someone has broken through
the iron wall's seal.

201
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:19,390
Alert Lord Chiriku!

202
00:12:20,101 --> 00:12:22,134
HIDAN: These guys don't
look like they'd willingly

203
00:12:22,144 --> 00:12:24,107
convert to the way of Jashin.

204
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:26,390
Nope. No converts here.

205
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,213
-Look at those robes!

206
00:12:28,223 --> 00:12:29,324
Could it be that
these two are--?

207
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:30,346
-There can be no doubt.

208
00:12:30,356 --> 00:12:31,387
They're from the Akatsuki.

209
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:37,416
MONK: Intruders!

210
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:39,229
CHIRIKU: Who are they?

211
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:42,163
MONK: Members of the
Akatsuki, My Lord!

212
00:12:42,173 --> 00:12:44,257
-(THINKING) I knew they'd
come calling someday.

213
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:45,298
But--

214
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:46,330
All right.

215
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,261
I will go.

216
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:49,414
Tell the others to stand by.

217
00:12:49,424 --> 00:12:50,266
-Uh.

218
00:12:57,426 --> 00:12:59,269
-Huh?

219
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,290
Ah.

220
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,345
Here goes another
highly virtuous fellow.

221
00:13:03,355 --> 00:13:06,309
KAKUZU: This one's more
than just virtuous.

222
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:10,385
According to our bingo book,
his head's worth 30 million.

223
00:13:10,395 --> 00:13:11,467
-Heh.

224
00:13:12,178 --> 00:13:14,421
Hey, we're not doing this
just for the bounty, are we?

225
00:13:14,431 --> 00:13:16,384
Killing a monk for
worldly gain is

226
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:19,249
a ticket to
damnation, my friend.

227
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:24,286
-Well, after all, they say that
money talks, wherever you go.

228
00:13:24,296 --> 00:13:27,301
-I don't know what your business
is here, but turn around

229
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:28,352
and keep moving.

230
00:13:28,362 --> 00:13:31,337
-You wont kill us without
a cause is that it?

231
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:32,358
Charming.

232
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:35,252
However, that's not
one of my beliefs.

233
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:38,447
-This fire temple is the
most famous Shinobi temple

234
00:13:38,457 --> 00:13:40,220
in the Land of Fire.

235
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,244
They say all it's monks
wield a special power known

236
00:13:43,254 --> 00:13:46,389
as the Gift of the Sages,
especially this one

237
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,452
worth 30 million.

238
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:53,259
He's an elite ninja who was once
one of the Guardian Shinobi 12

239
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:56,354
that protect the ruler
of the Land of Fire.

240
00:13:56,364 --> 00:13:59,378
The proof is there
on his waistcloth.

241
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:01,281
The Fire emblem.

242
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,313
-Really?

243
00:14:02,323 --> 00:14:03,494
Guardian Shinobi, huh?

244
00:14:03,504 --> 00:14:06,529
KAKUZU: Take care
Hidan, or you'll die.

245
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:07,520
-Give me a break.

246
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,462
Not that again.

247
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,336
Shut up, Kakuzu.

248
00:14:11,346 --> 00:14:12,298
Move it!

249
00:14:32,307 --> 00:14:34,310
-Wh-what the devil is that?

250
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,422
-I don't care what it is.

251
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:36,594
Just keep pressing the attack!

252
00:14:45,357 --> 00:14:48,351
[bodily impacts and blows]

253
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:03,504
-Now you're mine!

254
00:15:03,514 --> 00:15:06,508
[body impacts and blows]

255
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,517
[thud]

256
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:13,368
MONK: Yes!

257
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:15,371
He did it!

258
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,514
[monks cheering]

259
00:15:22,382 --> 00:15:24,655
-I will grant you a funeral.

260
00:15:24,665 --> 00:15:26,578
-(THINKING) I couldn't
bear having another

261
00:15:26,588 --> 00:15:30,394
religion's funeral
rites spoken over me.

262
00:15:30,404 --> 00:15:33,468
Jashin would surely punish me.

263
00:15:33,478 --> 00:15:35,401
Now I'm mad.

264
00:15:35,411 --> 00:15:36,583
Hey, Kakuzu.

265
00:15:36,593 --> 00:15:39,397
Since this one's
no Jinchuriki, I

266
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:42,492
can go ahead and obey
Jashin's commandments, right?

267
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:44,495
-Do what you like with him.

268
00:15:44,505 --> 00:15:48,541
But remember, his head is
worth 30 million to me.

269
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:51,425
So don't go overboard.

270
00:15:51,435 --> 00:15:54,419
I want him recognizable.

271
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:57,514
-Trading a human
being's life for money.

272
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,477
That's no way for
people to behave.

273
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,569
(ANGRY) Disgusting!

274
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:02,612
Just stay out of it, Kakuzu.

275
00:16:02,622 --> 00:16:05,466
(YELLING) Leave this one to me!

276
00:16:05,476 --> 00:16:06,467
Yah!

277
00:16:06,477 --> 00:16:08,610
[metallic clang]

278
00:16:08,621 --> 00:16:11,575
-Chiriku of the Fire
Temple will never

279
00:16:11,585 --> 00:16:13,478
be defeated by the likes of you!

280
00:16:16,672 --> 00:16:17,574
Raigo!

281
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:20,538
Thousand Hand Strike!

282
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:22,536
Yah!

283
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:45,545
-Well, I guess there
weren't any Jinchuriki hosts

284
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:46,787
to be found here after all.

285
00:16:47,498 --> 00:16:49,561
When I'm done with
my prayers, let's

286
00:16:49,571 --> 00:16:51,634
move on to our next thing.

287
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:52,706
KAKUZU: No.

288
00:16:52,716 --> 00:16:55,660
I'm taking him to the
collection office.

289
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,652
I want the bounty.

290
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:02,551
Money comes first.

291
00:17:02,561 --> 00:17:04,744
-Huh?

292
00:17:04,754 --> 00:17:05,806
You know something?

293
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,778
In case you hadn't
noticed, you're

294
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:09,791
really beginning to irritate me.

295
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:18,625
-(THINKING) I must
inform the Leaf Village.

296
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:19,626
HIDAN: Great.

297
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:21,799
So you're saying more delays?

298
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:24,644
-The Land of Fire is vast.

299
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:26,757
We are going to take our time.

300
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:27,788
-Fine.

301
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:29,751
But like I've always
said, if we fall behind,

302
00:17:29,761 --> 00:17:30,833
it's because of you!

303
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:31,834
Damn it, that hurts.

304
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:34,588
Ah!

305
00:17:34,598 --> 00:17:35,690
Uh!

306
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,752
Will you wait for me?

307
00:17:36,762 --> 00:17:38,815
Hold on!

308
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:39,786
NARUTO: Kakashi-sensei!

309
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,857
Hey, maybe, unh, maybe I
need more shadow clones, huh?

310
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:48,870
KAKASHI: What you
need is to transform

311
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,876
a massive amount of chakra into
wind to cut that waterfall.

312
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:55,660
Make too many clones,
and each one's chakra

313
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,871
will be that much weaker.

314
00:17:56,882 --> 00:18:00,697
Besides, that waterfall's barely
wide enough for the 10 of you.

315
00:18:00,707 --> 00:18:01,759
-Ah, come on, Kakashi-sensei.

316
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:03,772
[clones all protest]

317
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:04,903
There's got to be
a trick to this.

318
00:18:05,614 --> 00:18:08,699
Are you going to teach me, or do
I have to stay up here forever?

319
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:09,881
KAKASHI: You're not
storing the chakra

320
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:12,755
you create inside
yourself long enough.

321
00:18:12,765 --> 00:18:15,800
Take more time,
be more thorough.

322
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:19,675
-But if it takes that long, what
use is it on the battlefield?

323
00:18:19,685 --> 00:18:20,927
-You're still in
training, Naruto.

324
00:18:21,638 --> 00:18:22,890
Don't worry about
the battlefield.

325
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,756
Once you get used to
it, it'll flow faster.

326
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:27,828
-Yeah, but--

327
00:18:27,838 --> 00:18:30,942
-Oh, for crying out--
Listen, the change in nature

328
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,716
usually takes years to perfect.

329
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:36,881
Even leaf-cutting normally
takes six months, at least.

330
00:18:36,891 --> 00:18:39,765
YAMATO: You mastered
it in only a few hours.

331
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:41,678
-Mm?

332
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:42,770
-You don't need to rush.

333
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,706
You're progressing much
faster than we expected.

334
00:18:46,716 --> 00:18:48,959
KAKASHI: Even Sasuke, when
I taught him the Chidori,

335
00:18:48,969 --> 00:18:51,943
took quite a few days to achieve
the lightning change of nature.

336
00:18:56,781 --> 00:18:57,952
-That's just it.

337
00:18:57,962 --> 00:18:59,865
Sasuke's the one I
want to catch up with!

338
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:10,731
KAKASHI: OK.

339
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:17,882
Tenzo.

340
00:19:17,892 --> 00:19:20,876
[whispers]

341
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:22,879
-[soft laugh] Very well.

342
00:19:26,895 --> 00:19:29,890
[clones panicking]

343
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,884
[thundering roar]

344
00:19:41,908 --> 00:19:44,902
[tree trunks crunching]

345
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,052
-Hah, huh huh.

346
00:19:58,062 --> 00:19:59,073
-Wow.

347
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:01,056
That was tough even
for you, wasn't it?

348
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,829
-No, not at all.

349
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:06,885
[coughing] It was nothing.
[coughs] I'm fine.

350
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:07,866
[coughs again]

351
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:09,839
-(THINKING) That was tough.

352
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:10,961
How's that, Naruto?

353
00:20:10,971 --> 00:20:13,054
Now you've got nothing
to gripe about.

354
00:20:13,064 --> 00:20:17,891
--[laughs hysterically]
Multi-shadow Clone Jutsu!

355
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,082
[ending theme music]

356
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:28,016
[ending theme music]

357
00:21:59,162 --> 00:22:00,043
TSUNADE: What?

358
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:01,025
Attacked?

359
00:22:01,035 --> 00:22:02,066
The Fire Temple?

360
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:04,119
SHIZUNE: It must have
been the Akatsuki again.

361
00:22:04,129 --> 00:22:06,042
They're probably
searching every location

362
00:22:06,052 --> 00:22:07,224
that might hold a Jinchuriki.

363
00:22:07,234 --> 00:22:09,177
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): So
they're here at last.

364
00:22:09,187 --> 00:22:11,981
We'll see they never
leave the Land of Fire.

365
00:22:11,991 --> 00:22:13,103
Alert all 20 newly-formed teams.

366
00:22:13,113 --> 00:22:14,214
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):
Yes, M'lady.

367
00:22:14,224 --> 00:22:16,087
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): I'd like
to find out what they're after,

368
00:22:16,097 --> 00:22:17,227
but they're dangerous.

369
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:20,217
If they can't be
taken alive, so be it.

370
00:22:20,227 --> 00:22:22,047
Go!

371
00:22:22,057 --> 00:22:26,007
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time, "Under the Starry Sky"!
