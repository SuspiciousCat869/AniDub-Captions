1
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:12,547
{\an1}[attacking yell]

2
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,848
{\an1}[attacking yell]

3
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,798
This time, I'll
reach the other side!

4
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,509
{\an1}Just aim it a little
higher than you'd expect.

5
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,177
{\an1}That's the trick.

6
00:00:43,478 --> 00:00:47,115
{\an1}Yeah, I know! It'll
get there, if I simply

7
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:48,449
{\an1}put my all into it.

8
00:00:48,483 --> 00:00:51,519
Who the hell
are you, anyway?

9
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,222
{\an1}Right now, I'm your
stone-skipping rival,

10
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:57,525
but my stone is
already on the other side.

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,829
And that was my
first encounter

12
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:04,031
{\an1}with Madara Uchiha.

13
00:02:50,572 --> 00:02:53,275
{\an1}Answer me! I asked
you who you are!

14
00:02:53,308 --> 00:02:55,611
{\an1}First name's Hashirama,
but I can't tell

15
00:02:55,644 --> 00:02:57,446
{\an1}you my last name.

16
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,281
Hashirama, huh?

17
00:02:59,314 --> 00:03:02,150
Just watch me!
I'm gonna make it.

18
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:09,757
{\an1}<i>The way he throws. Just as</i>
<i>I thought! Shuriken Jutsu!</i>

19
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:18,967
{\an1}Why you! You stood
behind me on purpose

20
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:21,036
just to distract
me, didn't you?!

21
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:23,705
{\an1}I'm so sensitive that
I can't even pee if

22
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:26,241
{\an1}someone stands behind
me like you're doing!

23
00:03:28,877 --> 00:03:31,413
I'm sorry!

24
00:03:32,581 --> 00:03:37,052
{\an1}Uh... There's no need to
get all depressed about it.

25
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:40,389
I was making
excuses... I'm sorry.

26
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:43,592
{\an1}Well, I had no idea you
had such an obnoxious

27
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,628
{\an1}self-diagnosed neurosis.

28
00:03:46,662 --> 00:03:49,298
{\an1}You know, I can't tell if
you're a nice guy or just

29
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:51,133
{\an1}some kind of jerk!

30
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,501
[laughter]

31
00:03:52,534 --> 00:03:54,336
{\an1}Well, one thing's for
sure! I'm better at stone

32
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:55,971
{\an1}skipping than you!

33
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:57,774
{\an1}You want me to skip you
instead, you punk?!

34
00:03:57,806 --> 00:03:58,040
Sorry...

35
00:04:00,175 --> 00:04:02,844
I didn't mean
to make you mad.

36
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:05,547
{\an1}To make amends, I'll
let you throw me into the

37
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,950
{\an1}river. Go ahead, do it.

38
00:04:08,984 --> 00:04:11,820
{\an1}Good grief. Are you
aware of your own

39
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:13,121
{\an1}obnoxious neurosis?!

40
00:04:13,155 --> 00:04:15,090
It's just...

41
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:17,859
{\an1}I hope that I reach
the opposite shore...

42
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:20,829
{\an1}You're so annoying!
Look, just get lost!

43
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:22,632
Well...

44
00:04:22,665 --> 00:04:24,299
No, wait a sec!

45
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,468
Which is it? Why
don't you try to be a

46
00:04:26,502 --> 00:04:28,003
{\an1}little bit clearer?

47
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:30,473
No, Well it--

48
00:04:34,843 --> 00:04:35,812
What the...

49
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,686
{\an1}Are you a shinobi?

50
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:49,792
{\an1}This place'll become
a battlefield.

51
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:50,793
Go home now.

52
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:53,929
{\an1}This is the crest of
the Hagoromo Clan.

53
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:56,932
{\an1}Sorry, but I've gotta go.

54
00:04:58,266 --> 00:04:59,702
Later.

55
00:04:59,736 --> 00:05:01,337
Oh, uh...

56
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:03,939
{\an1}First name's Madara.

57
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:05,742
Madara...

58
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,411
{\an1}Not proffering one's family
name to a stranger

59
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:10,780
{\an1}is shinobi law, right?

60
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,917
I thought so.
You're a shinobi, too.

61
00:05:20,323 --> 00:05:23,259
{\an1}Our personalities differed,
and yet I sensed a

62
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:25,762
{\an1}mysterious kinship with
him all the same.

63
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:30,233
{\an1}I felt that I knew why he'd
come down to the river, too.

64
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:47,884
[crying]

65
00:05:51,387 --> 00:05:52,555
Kawarama...

66
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,224
{\an1}Shinobi don't cry!

67
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:58,861
{\an1}They're born into this world
to fight and die in battle!

68
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:01,130
{\an1}Be glad that we have
even a piece of his

69
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:02,932
{\an1}corpse left to bury!

70
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:06,169
{\an1}Because our enemies
this time include the

71
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:09,439
{\an1}Uchiha Clan in addition
to the Hagoromo Clan!

72
00:06:10,606 --> 00:06:12,375
{\an1}They're particularly
merciless!

73
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:16,012
{\an1}Kawarama was just
seven years old!

74
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:18,849
{\an1}How long?! How long are
all of these conflicts

75
00:06:18,882 --> 00:06:19,850
going to last?!

76
00:06:19,883 --> 00:06:22,886
{\an1}Until the very last foe has
been vanquished.

77
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,122
{\an1}The path to a world that is
free of battle is not easily

78
00:06:26,155 --> 00:06:27,925
paved!

79
00:06:27,957 --> 00:06:31,093
{\an1}And children must
be sacrificed?

80
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:38,267
I won't allow
disrespect for Kawarama!

81
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:40,636
{\an1}He fought and died as
nothing less than a

82
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,675
{\an1}full-fledged shinobi!
He wasn't a child!

83
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:53,851
Elder brother
Hashirama, are you okay?

84
00:06:53,884 --> 00:06:56,052
{\an1}You know what happens
when we defy Father.

85
00:06:56,085 --> 00:06:58,254
{\an1}C'mon, elder brother...

86
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,759
<i>I don't want...</i>

87
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:05,528
<i>Itama...</i>

88
00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:07,463
<i>Tobirama...</i>

89
00:07:07,497 --> 00:07:11,334
{\an1}<i>I don't want either</i>
<i>of you to die in vain!</i>

90
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:14,638
{\an1}Senju, the Clan of
love? Yeah, right!

91
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:16,773
A full-fledged
shinobi? Come on!

92
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:19,843
{\an1}All this is just adults
ganging up on kids and

93
00:07:19,877 --> 00:07:21,545
driving them to
their deaths!

94
00:07:21,578 --> 00:07:25,314
{\an1}We're doing exactly the
same thing as the Uchiha!

95
00:07:25,516 --> 00:07:28,150
That is how we
honor our opponents.

96
00:07:28,184 --> 00:07:30,420
{\an1}Even an infant, if
wielding a weapon,

97
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:32,054
{\an1}is deemed an enemy.

98
00:07:32,088 --> 00:07:34,892
{\an1}And raising one's child
to become full-fledged

99
00:07:34,925 --> 00:07:37,326
{\an1}is a true sign of a
parent's love!

100
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:39,730
{\an1}In order to become
full-fledged, you have

101
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:40,831
{\an1}to die, is that it?!

102
00:07:40,864 --> 00:07:43,500
{\an1}We kill and are killed
so much you can't keep

103
00:07:43,534 --> 00:07:44,835
{\an1}track of the grudges!

104
00:07:44,868 --> 00:07:48,438
{\an1}It's too risky to even say
your last name!

105
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:51,675
{\an1}I swear that this shinobi
world is totally messed up!

106
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,645
{\an1}Children like you
are known as brats!

107
00:07:54,678 --> 00:07:56,346
Father, no!

108
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,583
{\an1}Elder Brother's feeling
depressed today...

109
00:07:59,616 --> 00:08:02,252
{\an1}So please, forgive him.

110
00:08:07,691 --> 00:08:10,994
Just go and cool
your head, Hashirama.

111
00:08:17,634 --> 00:08:19,603
{\an1}Grown-ups are so stupid.

112
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:22,072
{\an1}It's simple! If they
really wanna stop wars,

113
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:23,807
{\an1}then they should just
make pacts and stop

114
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,808
{\an1}fighting with each other.

115
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:27,411
{\an1}What about avenging our
parents and our siblings

116
00:08:27,444 --> 00:08:30,080
{\an1}and all our friends
who were killed?

117
00:08:30,113 --> 00:08:33,383
{\an1}Keep saying that stuff
and you'll end up dead.

118
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:35,752
{\an1}Both you and the adults
are way too hotheaded.

119
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:37,521
Sorry...

120
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:39,991
{\an1}Forthcoming shinobi really
need to suppress their

121
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:42,826
{\an1}emotions, create suitable
rules that they then follow,

122
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:46,430
{\an1}and mantain and avoid any
extraneous conflict.

123
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,336
{\an1}Can't a true pact...

124
00:08:52,369 --> 00:08:55,439
{\an1}...a true alliance
be achieved?

125
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:01,578
{\an1}A "true alliance,"
Elder Brother?

126
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:08,151
{\an1}During the Era of Warring
States, the average life

127
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:10,922
{\an1}expectancy of both
shinobi and citizens

128
00:09:10,955 --> 00:09:14,058
{\an1}was around 30 years old.

129
00:09:18,562 --> 00:09:22,399
{\an1}And what was keeping that
average so low was...

130
00:09:32,643 --> 00:09:34,244
[gasp]

131
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:38,181
Itama!

132
00:09:39,984 --> 00:09:42,319
...the deaths of
many young children.

133
00:09:42,352 --> 00:09:45,023
Itama! [crying]

134
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:14,284
{\an1}Hey, long time no see!

135
00:10:14,317 --> 00:10:16,020
So, um...

136
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:17,722
It's Hashirama.

137
00:10:17,755 --> 00:10:20,958
{\an1}Hashirama. This time
you're depressed right from

138
00:10:20,992 --> 00:10:23,828
{\an1}the start. What happened?

139
00:10:24,162 --> 00:10:27,331
What do you
mean?! I'm fine...

140
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:31,602
Liar! Wanna talk
to me? I'll listen.

141
00:10:31,636 --> 00:10:32,737
It's nothing...

142
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,039
{\an1}Come on, just spill it!

143
00:10:35,073 --> 00:10:37,608
{\an1}No. There isn't anything.

144
00:10:37,642 --> 00:10:41,211
{\an1}Hey, stop dragging this
out! I promise I'll listen!

145
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:44,148
It's really
nothing, I swear!

146
00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:45,483
{\an1}It's nothing at all.

147
00:10:45,516 --> 00:10:48,820
Look, out with
it, already!

148
00:10:50,254 --> 00:10:52,990
{\an1}What's the matter?

149
00:10:53,024 --> 00:10:58,496
{\an1}My lil' brother died...

150
00:11:01,432 --> 00:11:04,936
{\an1}I come to the river
because I feel like all

151
00:11:04,969 --> 00:11:07,172
{\an1}the haziness in my heart
gets washed away as

152
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:08,940
{\an1}I stare at the water.

153
00:11:10,808 --> 00:11:12,944
{\an1}So that's what happened...

154
00:11:13,778 --> 00:11:16,547
Your name's
Madara, right?

155
00:11:16,581 --> 00:11:19,218
Could it be that
way for you, too?

156
00:11:21,586 --> 00:11:24,189
{\an1}Do you have siblings?

157
00:11:24,223 --> 00:11:26,125
{\an1}I'm one of five.

158
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:28,760
Well, there used
to be five of us.

159
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,375
Used to be?

160
00:11:44,408 --> 00:11:47,212
{\an1}We are shinobi, after
all. We never know

161
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:48,914
{\an1}when we might die.

162
00:11:48,947 --> 00:11:52,251
{\an1}If there's a way where
neither side has to die...

163
00:11:52,283 --> 00:11:54,652
{\an1}It'd be where they
revealed what's inside

164
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:56,521
{\an1}them, hid nothing.

165
00:11:56,554 --> 00:12:00,358
{\an1}And they drank together
like they were brothers.

166
00:12:00,391 --> 00:12:02,995
{\an1}But then that's impossible.

167
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:04,729
'Cause one can't
really look deep inside

168
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:07,465
someone and see
who they really are.

169
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:13,304
{\an1}In reality, they both could
be seething inside.

170
00:12:15,674 --> 00:12:18,811
{\an1}It's impossible to
show what's inside

171
00:12:18,844 --> 00:12:20,145
{\an1}us to each other?

172
00:12:21,113 --> 00:12:22,547
I don't know...

173
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,784
{\an1}But every time I come here,
I make a wish that I'll find

174
00:12:25,818 --> 00:12:27,518
{\an1}some way to make it happen.

175
00:12:32,356 --> 00:12:34,860
{\an1}Hey, look! Seems I
finally got it to go

176
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:36,394
{\an1}in the right direction!

177
00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:38,964
{\an1}It's not just yours...

178
00:12:38,997 --> 00:12:42,668
Mine too reached
the other side.

179
00:12:45,571 --> 00:12:49,241
{\an1}In all honesty, I was
shocked that another person

180
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:52,544
{\an1}understood how I felt,
especially considering all

181
00:12:52,578 --> 00:12:54,146
{\an1}the people that didn't.

182
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:57,816
{\an1}So there was another foolish
kid who thought as I did,

183
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,752
{\an1}who wanted to try to
change this war-torn era.

184
00:13:03,055 --> 00:13:05,023
{\an1}But rather than being
shocked at this turn of

185
00:13:05,057 --> 00:13:08,660
{\an1}events, I considered Madara
a gift from the divine.

186
00:13:09,962 --> 00:13:12,664
{\an1}But with you, I can
tell without even

187
00:13:12,698 --> 00:13:14,032
{\an1}having to look inside.

188
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,601
Tell what?

189
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:19,538
{\an1}That your hairdo and your
outfit are totally lame!

190
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:27,179
{\an1}Not that we thought alike in
every respect, of course...

191
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:29,781
After that we
started meeting up

192
00:13:29,815 --> 00:13:31,216
{\an1}every now and then...

193
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,820
{\an1}...still without knowing
each other's last names.

194
00:13:35,387 --> 00:13:38,590
{\an1}We'd spar and compare
our shinobi moves or

195
00:13:38,624 --> 00:13:40,692
{\an1}talk about the future.

196
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,230
{\an1}Taijutsu and kumite.

197
00:13:44,264 --> 00:13:48,000
{\an1}You did a nice job pulling
out a draw against me!

198
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:50,802
No way. It's not
quite a draw.

199
00:13:50,836 --> 00:13:51,603
'Cause I'm
still standing.

200
00:13:51,637 --> 00:13:53,206
Oh?

201
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:55,208
Ow!

202
00:13:56,775 --> 00:13:59,711
You were saying?
Not a draw, huh?

203
00:13:59,745 --> 00:14:02,414
{\an1}But how could you?

204
00:14:02,447 --> 00:14:04,150
[laughter]

205
00:14:04,183 --> 00:14:06,919
{\an1}I threw it the instant
you blew me away.

206
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:09,888
{\an1}I'm not gonna get
taken down that easily!

207
00:14:13,825 --> 00:14:16,362
{\an1}But the question is,
how do we bring about

208
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:17,629
{\an1}concrete changes?

209
00:14:17,663 --> 00:14:20,632
{\an1}We've gotta have a
vision for the future.

210
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,403
{\an1}The first step is to not
give up on our ideals.

211
00:14:23,435 --> 00:14:26,339
{\an1}And we're gonna have
to get stronger, too.

212
00:14:26,372 --> 00:14:28,107
A couple of weak
pups barking won't

213
00:14:28,141 --> 00:14:29,608
{\an1}change anything.

214
00:14:29,641 --> 00:14:31,010
You're right...

215
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:32,979
{\an1}If we can master all
sorts of jutsu and

216
00:14:33,012 --> 00:14:34,546
become stronger
then the adults won't

217
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:38,750
{\an1}be able to ignore
our words anymore.

218
00:14:38,784 --> 00:14:43,289
{\an1}We gotta master many jutsu
and cover any weakness.

219
00:14:44,756 --> 00:14:48,261
{\an1}Well I'm half there already!
I'm stronger than most of

220
00:14:48,294 --> 00:14:49,594
{\an1}the adults around me.

221
00:14:49,628 --> 00:14:53,532
Really? That's
impressive!

222
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:05,011
You really
weren't kidding.

223
00:15:05,044 --> 00:15:07,479
{\an1}I said not to stand
behind me! Get lost!

224
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:08,848
Found your
weakness! [chuckle]

225
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:12,952
{\an1}How about I throw you into
the river I just pissed in?!

226
00:15:13,453 --> 00:15:15,554
Take this! It's
my Water Style!

227
00:15:15,587 --> 00:15:19,325
{\an1}Yech! Disgusting!
Don't whip it around!

228
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:22,895
{\an1}Each time we met,
we became closer.

229
00:15:28,968 --> 00:15:29,869
Madara!

230
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:32,672
{\an1}I've come up with
an amazing jutsu!

231
00:15:32,705 --> 00:15:35,008
{\an1}Let's both master
it together!

232
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,143
{\an1}Really? Show me.

233
00:15:37,176 --> 00:15:40,580
{\an1}Secret Taijutsu Technique, a
Super Fire Style Genjutsu

234
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:42,348
{\an1}Slice Giant Shuriken
Two-Step Drop Jutsu!

235
00:15:42,382 --> 00:15:44,884
No good. I
can't visualize it.

236
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:48,254
{\an1}I mean, which is it,
taijutsu or genjutsu?

237
00:15:48,287 --> 00:15:49,155
It's not clear!

238
00:15:49,188 --> 00:15:49,789
Plus...

239
00:15:49,822 --> 00:15:52,191
{\an1}The name is way too long!

240
00:15:52,225 --> 00:15:53,793
{\an1}Who could remember
all of that?!

241
00:15:53,826 --> 00:15:56,262
{\an1}Just give me a second,
let me explain it...

242
00:15:56,295 --> 00:16:00,533
{\an1}Shaddup! Today, we'll be
competing in cliff climbing!

243
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:04,405
Quit getting
depressed so easily!

244
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:06,572
{\an1}That's your weakness.

245
00:16:06,606 --> 00:16:08,775
{\an1}And your weakness
is always assuming

246
00:16:08,808 --> 00:16:10,209
{\an1}that's what's going on!

247
00:16:10,243 --> 00:16:11,210
Huh?

248
00:16:11,244 --> 00:16:13,212
{\an1}Don't you get it? I'm
just psyching you out...

249
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:14,180
[gasp]

250
00:16:14,213 --> 00:16:15,748
{\an1}...so I'll win at
cliff climbing!

251
00:16:15,782 --> 00:16:17,484
You bastard!

252
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,585
[laughter] See
you at the top!

253
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:22,188
You were only
pretending to be sad?!

254
00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:27,660
{\an1}[chuckle] I won...

255
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:32,732
{\an1}Of course you did! I mean,
you did have a head start!

256
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:42,675
{\an1}Wow, what a sweeping
view of the forest!

257
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,645
Yeah, you can
see really far!

258
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:48,781
{\an1}Speaking of eyesight, I'm
pretty sure you can't beat

259
00:16:48,815 --> 00:16:50,417
{\an1}me. Wanna challenge me?

260
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:52,553
{\an1}What are you talking about?

261
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:54,654
You seem really
proud of your eyes.

262
00:16:54,687 --> 00:16:58,158
{\an1}Yeah, of course I am!
'Cause I've got the Sha-

263
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:03,564
What's up?

264
00:17:03,596 --> 00:17:07,134
{\an1}Uh, guess it's not all
that. Never mind.

265
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:09,836
{\an1}[scoff] Come on, what is
it? You're being awfully

266
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:11,671
{\an1}candid for once.

267
00:17:11,704 --> 00:17:14,541
{\an1}Or else my siblings
wouldn't be dead.

268
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:18,312
{\an1}But I wasn't even
able to protect them.

269
00:17:18,345 --> 00:17:20,613
I shouldn't...

270
00:17:21,781 --> 00:17:22,950
Shouldn't...

271
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:25,452
Madara...

272
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,762
{\an1}Sorry, I guess I brought
back some memories

273
00:17:35,796 --> 00:17:37,297
{\an1}for you too, huh?

274
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:42,569
So do you have
any siblings left?

275
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,372
{\an1}I do. I still have one
younger brother

276
00:17:45,405 --> 00:17:47,241
{\an1}who's still alive.

277
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,911
And I'm going to
protect him, no matter

278
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,645
{\an1}what happens, I swear!

279
00:17:54,314 --> 00:17:56,150
{\an1}So what about you?

280
00:17:56,183 --> 00:17:59,720
{\an1}I have one brother left,
too. And I also intend to

281
00:17:59,753 --> 00:18:01,455
{\an1}protect him, no matter what.

282
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,458
I've decided!

283
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:07,761
Let's build our
settlement right here!

284
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:08,762
Huh?!

285
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:11,131
{\an1}And there we'll make
it so kids won't

286
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:12,600
{\an1}have to kill each
other, and

287
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,268
{\an1}we'll create this
awesome school where kids

288
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,539
{\an1}can train and grow up
to become stronger!

289
00:18:17,572 --> 00:18:20,140
{\an1}Assign missions that
fit people's abilities

290
00:18:20,174 --> 00:18:21,808
{\an1}and their strengths, too!

291
00:18:21,842 --> 00:18:24,479
{\an1}Have superiors who are
able to properly assign

292
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:26,548
{\an1}ranks to commissions!

293
00:18:26,581 --> 00:18:28,849
{\an1}A place where kids
don't have to be sent

294
00:18:28,882 --> 00:18:30,652
{\an1}into harsh battlefronts.

295
00:18:30,684 --> 00:18:33,287
{\an1}[chuckling] You do
realize it's only you

296
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,155
{\an1}spouting such nonsense.

297
00:18:35,189 --> 00:18:37,592
{\an1}Yeah? What about you?!

298
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,561
{\an1}It sounds pretty good!

299
00:18:39,594 --> 00:18:41,328
{\an1}Well, then it's decided!

300
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:42,430
All right!

301
00:18:42,463 --> 00:18:46,033
{\an1}If that settlement is built,
then that would mean...

302
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:48,135
{\an1}I could protect my
brother here, from this

303
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,770
{\an1}boundless vantage point!

304
00:18:49,803 --> 00:18:52,039
[happy chuckle]

305
00:18:52,373 --> 00:18:54,841
[laughter]

306
00:18:55,376 --> 00:18:57,778
{\an1}That was where the Village
Hidden in the Leaves

307
00:18:57,811 --> 00:18:59,414
{\an1}would eventually stand.

308
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:04,718
{\an1}I made a resolution that
day. I swore that I would

309
00:19:04,751 --> 00:19:06,954
endure for the
sake of my vision.

310
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:15,597
{\an1}We both made it across.

311
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,466
That's a good
stone for skipping.

312
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:23,671
{\an1}I'll let you hold onto it
'till the next time we meet!

313
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:40,622
{\an1}What is it, Tobirama?

314
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:43,491
Elder Brother,
we must talk.

315
00:19:50,164 --> 00:19:53,101
Hashirama, about
this boy you've been

316
00:19:53,134 --> 00:19:54,102
{\an1}meeting up with...

317
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:56,404
{\an1}[gasp] How'd you?

318
00:19:56,437 --> 00:19:58,839
{\an1}I've been tailing you,
following father's

319
00:19:58,872 --> 00:19:59,641
{\an1}orders, elder brother.

320
00:19:59,674 --> 00:20:00,807
You what?!

321
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:03,945
{\an1}I have more sensory
skill than you.

322
00:20:04,646 --> 00:20:08,216
{\an1}You've been going out all by
yourself quite often lately.

323
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,085
So I suspected
something was up.

324
00:20:11,986 --> 00:20:14,822
I looked into
that young man.

325
00:20:14,856 --> 00:20:18,293
{\an1}And learned that he
belongs to the Uchiha Clan.

326
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,430
{\an1}He has killed capable
adults from our clan.

327
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:24,866
{\an1}It seems that he's
a genius born with

328
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:27,101
{\an1}inherent shinobi talent.

329
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:30,305
So I was right.

330
00:20:31,472 --> 00:20:34,142
{\an1}And given your obvious
lack of surprise...

331
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,544
{\an1}Don't tell me that the
two of you were actually

332
00:20:36,577 --> 00:20:38,946
{\an1}aware of each other's
family names already!

333
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,015
{\an1}No! I didn't know.

334
00:20:41,582 --> 00:20:43,351
{\an1}And I doubt he does...

335
00:20:43,384 --> 00:20:44,552
Hashirama.

336
00:20:44,585 --> 00:20:47,388
{\an1}You understand what
this means, don't you?

337
00:20:49,658 --> 00:20:52,795
The Senju Clan
and the Uchiha Clan

338
00:20:52,827 --> 00:20:54,529
{\an1}are bitter enemies.

339
00:20:54,562 --> 00:20:56,565
{\an1}I haven't mentioned
anything about this

340
00:20:56,598 --> 00:20:58,567
{\an1}to the other Senju yet.

341
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,002
But if we're not
careful, you could be

342
00:21:01,035 --> 00:21:02,671
{\an1}branded a traitor.

343
00:21:02,705 --> 00:21:06,240
{\an1}If you don't want to be
suspected as a spy

344
00:21:06,274 --> 00:21:08,711
{\an1}then you must shadow that
youth after the next time

345
00:21:08,744 --> 00:21:10,011
{\an1}the two of you meet.

346
00:21:10,044 --> 00:21:13,247
{\an1}You're to bring home
intel on the Uchiha Clan.

347
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:15,249
{\an1}That is your mission.

348
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:20,656
And if he should
notice you, kill him!

349
00:22:57,786 --> 00:23:00,522
{\an1}<i>Maybe it just isn't possible</i>
<i>for us to reach that pipe</i>

350
00:23:00,556 --> 00:23:02,524
<i>dream of ours.</i>

351
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:04,928
{\an1}<i>Madara, what are you?!</i>

352
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,331
{\an1}<i>It might have been brief,</i>
<i>but it was fun, Hashirama.</i>

353
00:23:09,364 --> 00:23:12,468
{\an1}<i>Our next meeting will likely</i>
<i>be on the battlefield.</i>

354
00:23:12,968 --> 00:23:18,140
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Era of</i>
<i>Warring States."</i>

355
00:23:18,173 --> 00:23:20,342
{\an1}I truly wish it wasn't so...
