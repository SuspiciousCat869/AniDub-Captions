00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:53,609
{\an1}"The Bridge to Peace"

2
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:04,981
Uh!

3
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:10,217
{\an1}You will not escape!

4
00:02:13,652 --> 00:02:14,252
[grunting]

5
00:02:20,888 --> 00:02:26,124
{\an4}You can't transport away
to safety this time.
You see, I've been paying
close attention to you

6
00:02:26,157 --> 00:02:27,557
{\an1}all these years...

7
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:32,260
{\an1}<i>When you transport</i>
<i>yourself elsewhere... you</i>
<i>must first materialize. </i>

8
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,229
{\an4}<i>And it takes longer to</i>
<i>pull yourself in than</i>
<i>another person or</i>
<i>object.</i>

9
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:43,797
{\an7}If I hadn't switched from
flying to slipping past
that explosion, things

10
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:47,033
{\an7}would have gotten very
bad very quickly...

11
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:52,534
{\an7}<i>I also know you can only</i>
<i>slip through objects for</i>
<i>no more than five</i>
<i>minutes. </i>

12
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:55,369
{\an1}What...?!

13
00:02:56,903 --> 00:02:59,305
{\an1}<i>They're all Paper</i>
<i>Bombs! </i>

14
00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:10,076
{\an7}I have amassed six
hundred billion Paper
Bombs. I'll make sure
that I kill you!

15
00:03:10,676 --> 00:03:13,643
{\an7}And they'll continue to
explode for ten minutes!

16
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,246
[grunting]

17
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:33,019
{\an1}I encouraged and pushed
Yahiko to form the
Akatsuki.

18
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:34,086
{\an1}And...

19
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:37,854
{\an1}I was the one who gave
Nagato the Rinnegan.

20
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:44,257
{\an1}<i>Yahiko and Nagato were</i>
<i>acting of their own free</i>
<i>will. </i>

21
00:03:56,796 --> 00:04:00,130
{\an7}<i>They were not your pawns!</i>

22
00:04:00,164 --> 00:04:05,498
{\an7}<i>You and Konan must</i>
<i>survive, no matter</i>
<i>what... </i>

23
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,935
{\an5}Whatever it looked like
to you, they both fought
and died for their own
beliefs!

24
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:14,736
{\an1}<i>They will always share</i>
<i>that! </i>

25
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:17,805
{\an1}I won't let you
interfere!

26
00:04:31,378 --> 00:04:36,946

27
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:44,515
{\an7}<i>My Sacred Paper Emissary</i>
<i>Jutsu has come undone. I</i>
<i>didn't anticipate needing</i>
<i>this much chakra.</i>

28
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:48,918
{\an7}<i>But... at least...</i>
<i>Madara...</i>

29
00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:53,486
... Is dead?

30
00:05:08,994 --> 00:05:12,928
How?! How are you... not
dead?!

31
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:20,698
{\an5}I ran the simulations
over and over. I was sure
this would work! You
should be dead!

32
00:05:21,665 --> 00:05:27,868
{\an7}The Izanagi, an Uchiha
forbidden jutsu where the
user sacrifices sight in

33
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:31,602
{\an7}that eye to tie illusion
and reality together.

34
00:05:31,635 --> 00:05:38,006
{\an7}Only those who posses the
powers of both the Uchiha
and the Senju can perform
it.

35
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:41,874
The powers of both the
Uchiha and the Senju
combined...?

36
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:47,443
{\an8}But that is the Six
Paths' power... And I
know that's not a power
that you possess...

37
00:05:48,343 --> 00:05:52,778
{\an1}[chuckling]
Since you are a dear and
former comrade,... I

38
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,414
{\an1}suppose you deserve to
know that little bit of
my history...

39
00:05:57,347 --> 00:06:01,316
{\an1}The Izanagi is the
practical application of
what you know as the Sage

40
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:04,583
{\an1}of Six Paths' Creation
of all Things.

41
00:06:04,816 --> 00:06:08,152
{\an1}<i>Originally, the Uchiha</i>
<i>and the Senju were one. </i>

42
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:12,587
{\an1}<i>Their originator, the</i>
<i>Sage of the Six Paths,</i>
<i>possessed the blood and</i>

43
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,955
{\an1}<i>powers of both and</i>
<i>created many things.</i>

44
00:06:17,522 --> 00:06:22,691
{\an1}<i>Shadow Style, founded</i>
<i>upon mental energies that</i>
<i>govern imagination...</i>

45
00:06:22,724 --> 00:06:26,160
{\an1}<i>can be used to create</i>
<i>form out of nothing...</i>

46
00:06:26,193 --> 00:06:30,828
{\an1}<i>And Light Style, founded</i>
<i>upon physical energies</i>
<i>that govern life... can</i>

47
00:06:30,862 --> 00:06:33,929
{\an1}<i>be used to instill life</i>
<i>into that form.</i>

48
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:38,998
{\an1}<i>The Tailed Beasts are one</i>
<i>example. The Sage used</i>
<i>the Shadow and Light</i>

49
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:43,566
{\an1}<i>Styles to create nine</i>
<i>Tailed Beasts from Ten</i>
<i>Tails' chakra.</i>

50
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,536
{\an1}A jutsu that can make
fantasy into reality.
That is the Izanagi.

51
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:54,172
Just who are you...? And
what exactly are you...?!

52
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:59,508
The world believes that
Madara Uchiha lost to
Hashirama Senju.

53
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:05,843
But what is the real
truth? Victors are those
that look and plan ahead.

54
00:07:05,877 --> 00:07:11,945
{\an5}The true contest is just
beginning... I only fought
the previous battle to obtain
his power.

55
00:07:12,346 --> 00:07:17,648
{\an7}<i>I am Madara Uchiha. I</i>
<i>possess the power of</i>
<i>Hashirama Senju.</i>

56
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:22,084
{\an7}<i>I am the Second Sage</i>
<i>of the Six Paths. I</i>
<i>am unique.</i>

57
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:29,320
{\an4}A few have managed an
imperfect Izanagi, but
they were unable to
control Hashirama's power.

58
00:07:29,653 --> 00:07:38,791
[groaning]

59
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:47,560
{\an4}You'll be seeing Nagato
soon. You can discuss how
you both fell for
Naruto's foolish dreams.

60
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:50,463
{\an1}There's no such thing as
peace!

61
00:07:53,397 --> 00:07:55,498
{\an1}There is no such thing as
hope!

62
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:05,002
{\an1}Nagato only believed in
Naruto to find solace in
his pathetic existence.

63
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:07,370
[gasping]

64
00:08:22,575 --> 00:08:26,344
{\an7}<i>This... can't be.</i>

65
00:08:27,546 --> 00:08:32,114
{\an1}But Nagato... is someone who
will be the bridge that
leads to peace.

66
00:08:32,147 --> 00:08:37,149
{\an1}My role's to make that
happen. I'm a pillar that
will support that bridge.

67
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:42,951
{\an7}It's Yahiko who'll be the
bridge to peace. That is,
his will itself is will be.

68
00:08:44,386 --> 00:08:53,756
{\an7}<i>Seems this is it for</i>
<i>me... Naruto... I believe</i>
<i>you of all people...</i>
<i>can... </i>

69
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:58,559
{\an1}The never-ending Hidden
Rain downpour is letting
up? What's going on?!

70
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:04,760
Yahiko! Nagato! Their
wills shall not be
extinguished!

71
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:08,762
{\an1}I too believe in Naruto!
And it's his turn now!

72
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:11,596
{\an1}Naruto will be the bridge
to peace!

73
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:15,566
{\an1}And I vow right now that
I shall be the pillar
that supports him!

74
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,000
{\an7}<i>Thank you, Nagato...</i>

75
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:22,001
{\an7}<i>... for giving me hope</i>
<i>even from beyond the</i>
<i>grave. </i>

76
00:09:23,302 --> 00:09:28,205
{\an1}I am expendable; I am
only a mere flower. But
I'll take you with me.

77
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:30,405
[grunting]

78
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:32,672
[grunting]

79
00:09:43,144 --> 00:09:44,144
Huh!

80
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:00,851
Uh!

81
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:04,619
{\an1}You called me darkness.

82
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:11,556
{\an1}Well then, I shall make
you wilt. And cause this
sparkling rainbow bridge

83
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,023
{\an1}of yours to fade into the
darkness as well.

84
00:10:14,057 --> 00:10:15,924
[choking]

85
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:22,794
{\an4}When my genjutsu' is
finished, you will be,
too. After I've made you
tell me where the Rinnegan is.

86
00:10:22,827 --> 00:10:26,662
[choking]

87
00:10:46,138 --> 00:10:48,439
{\an1}So this is the place.

88
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:57,008
{\an1}You were the third Sage
of the Six Paths.

89
00:10:58,476 --> 00:11:06,312
{\an7}You exerted so much power
that your red hair, proof of
your Uzumaki Clan lineage,
turned white.

90
00:11:10,647 --> 00:11:15,216
{\an1}<i>You betrayed me, and</i>
<i>still you laugh at me? </i>

91
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,592
{\an1}That took too long.

92
00:11:35,658 --> 00:11:37,193
{\an1}I'd better go.

93
00:12:19,178 --> 00:12:24,979
{\an4}<i>Konan's is the one on the</i>
<i>right. Yahiko's in the</i>
<i>middle. And Nagato's the</i>
<i>one on the left. </i>

94
00:12:25,013 --> 00:12:26,548
{\an1}But what are they?

95
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:29,115
{\an1}You'll flip for these
flip tiles!

96
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,749
Flip tiles, huh?

97
00:12:30,782 --> 00:12:35,485
{\an4}That's right. The front
side, which you see here,
is red, and the back is
white.

98
00:12:35,518 --> 00:12:38,319
{\an1}You just flip them over
like this!

99
00:12:46,088 --> 00:12:48,657
{\an1}Uhhh...
[coughing]

100
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:50,424
{\an1}Anyway... listen...

101
00:12:50,457 --> 00:12:55,493
{\an4}When you guys're here I
want each one of you to
have the red side of your
tile showing.

102
00:12:55,526 --> 00:13:00,995
{\an4}Then, when you leave to
go out, flip it over so
the white side is facing
out, like this.

103
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:05,130
{\an1}This picture is a secret
code that says you'll be
returning shortly. Oh, yeah.

104
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:11,366
Sensei... What's with
the ridiculous grin?

105
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,968
{\an8}You know we're only
letting you get away with
all of this frog stuff 'cause
you're the Toad Sage...

106
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:20,003
{\an1}[gritting teeth]

107
00:13:20,037 --> 00:13:21,404
<i>But--</i>

108
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:24,271
{\an1}... what do these three
tiles have to do with
anything?

109
00:13:24,705 --> 00:13:30,341
{\an4}This region is still
unstable, so it's unsafe.
We could be targeted at
any time.

110
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:34,677
{\an4}<i>When we're in our</i>
<i>hideout, our</i>
<i>headquarters, the enemy</i>
<i>can locate us easily. If</i>

111
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:38,345
{\an4}<i>we were scattered, we</i>
<i>could counter with a</i>
<i>surprise attack, for</i>
<i>example.</i>

112
00:13:38,378 --> 00:13:41,979
{\an7}So if the red side of a
person's tile is showing
but they're not here,

113
00:13:42,012 --> 00:13:44,581
{\an7}then it could mean that
they've been kidnapped or
something.

114
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:48,082
{\an7}Or if the white side is
showing but that person
is in the room, it could

115
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:50,849
{\an7}mean that they're really
an enemy, transformed.

116
00:13:50,883 --> 00:13:54,051
{\an7}With this system, we can
notice stuff like that,
right?

117
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:59,320
{\an4}Yes, that's exactly
right. Nicely deduced,
Konan; you're pretty
sharp! Unlike Yahiko here.

118
00:13:59,354 --> 00:14:02,055
{\an1}I knew! I knew it, too!

119
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:04,389
{\an1}Oh...?

120
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:08,324
{\an1}Uh, I mean I mostly knew
it...

121
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:10,658
{\an1}[giggling]

122
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:17,061
{\an4}Anyway, only we three
know this code. It'll help
us know where everyone is
at any given time.

123
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:22,630
{\an4}We can't ever really
relax, even when we're at
home, right here in our
own hideout. Also...

124
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:32,834
{\an7}I've constructed a secret
room under here with an
underground escape passage
that leads outside.

125
00:14:33,168 --> 00:14:35,369
{\an1}Wow, that is so shinobi!

126
00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:41,738
{\an1}<i>If anything happens, use</i>
<i>it to get away. </i>

127
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:45,039
{\an1}<i>Oh, and by the way...</i>

128
00:14:45,073 --> 00:14:48,007
{\an1}<i>The tile back there</i>
<i>behind you is mine. </i>

129
00:14:49,609 --> 00:14:54,977
{\an4}All right, now it's time
for today's lesson! I
call this "Water in a
Frog's Face" training!

130
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,079
{\an1}You'll hone your
endurance by becoming a
frog and learning not to

131
00:14:58,112 --> 00:15:00,280
{\an1}react to anything thrown
in your face!

132
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:02,080
All right! Yes!

133
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:08,049
{\an1}Come on, you
guys, let's go!

134
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,985
{\an1}Yahiko, do you really get
why we're doing all this?
Sensei turned them around

135
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:14,885
{\an1}for us this time, but you
need to do it.

136
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:19,388
{\an1}I'm going to get real
strong, I swear! And
then...

137
00:15:20,255 --> 00:15:22,822
{\an1}I'm going to change the
entire world!

138
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,056
{\an3}Uh!

139
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,457
{\an1}[giggling]

140
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,363
{\an1}[smiling]
Hm!

141
00:15:39,463 --> 00:15:40,763
[chuckling]

142
00:15:42,698 --> 00:15:46,232
{\an4}Before you start changing
things, you should first
learn to change your tile
like I just showed you!

143
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,868
{\an7}<i>Wait... is that the look</i>
<i>I gave them before? How</i>
<i>embarrassing! </i>

144
00:15:58,938 --> 00:15:59,838
Uh!

145
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:12,010
{\an7}<i>Clever... She used the</i>
<i>Wind Style to speed up</i>
<i>her Paper Shuriken.</i>
<i>However...</i>

146
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:25,516
[grunting]

147
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:26,850
{\an1}Not again!

148
00:16:30,218 --> 00:16:34,853
{\an7}It's not good enough yet.
You have to move quicker
and coordinate your
attacks better!

149
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:37,721
{\an1}<i>All right! Let's eat! </i>

150
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:39,622
{\an1}Thanks for the food!

151
00:16:40,155 --> 00:16:42,256
Hey! No fair, Sensei!

152
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,557
{\an1}<i>Oh, is that so? </i>

153
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:44,557
That's mine!

154
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:46,325
<i>[laughing]</i>
<i>It's not funny!</i>

155
00:16:54,962 --> 00:16:57,297
{\an1}Jiraiya Sensei... Thank
you...

156
00:18:00,757 --> 00:18:04,625
[panting]

157
00:18:04,658 --> 00:18:06,292
{\an1}<i>Are you the Akatsuki? </i>

158
00:18:09,927 --> 00:18:11,828
<i>Who's that? </i>

159
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:15,263
{\an1}<i>The head of the Hidden</i>
<i>Rain, Hanzo of the</i>
<i>Salamander.</i>

160
00:18:15,296 --> 00:18:16,963
{\an1}Who's your leader?

161
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:21,633
I am Yahiko! And I lead
the Akatsuki!

162
00:18:27,168 --> 00:18:29,469
{\an1}I shall remember you.

163
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,805
{\an1}Yahiko...?

164
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:35,838
So what did that mean?!

165
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:39,940
{\an1}Hanzo acknowledged us.
We're staring to be taken
seriously.

166
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:47,043
{\an1}<i>Our organization has</i>
<i>gotten too big. We need a</i>
<i>new hideout. </i>

167
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,378
Today's our last day
here.

168
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:50,844
Yeah...

169
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:55,647
{\an7}This is where all of us
grew up. And became
strong.

170
00:18:56,314 --> 00:18:58,848
{\an7}Everything started right
here for us.

171
00:18:58,881 --> 00:19:04,150
{\an7}We're leaving to chase
our dreams and make them
come true. And then...

172
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:14,822
Uh!

173
00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:20,524
Where'd they go?

174
00:19:21,157 --> 00:19:24,760
{\an7}I can't believe that
secret room came in handy
at the end.

175
00:19:24,793 --> 00:19:29,462
{\an1}Okay, now that was
unexpected. But it was
appropriate, I guess.

176
00:19:29,495 --> 00:19:32,563
{\an1}Now, let's go! Nagato!
Konan!

177
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:46,702
{\an4}<i>We're leaving to chase</i>
<i>our dreams and make</i>
<i>them come true. And</i>
<i>then... </i>

178
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:48,570
{\an1}<i>Once that happens...</i>

179
00:19:49,036 --> 00:19:51,337
{\an1}<i>Even if we're split</i>
<i>apart...</i>

180
00:19:53,538 --> 00:19:56,439
{\an1}<i>Let's meet back here</i>
<i>one day.</i>

181
00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:02,843
{\an1}<i>And we'll all</i>
<i>celebrate together!</i>

182
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:06,411
{\an1}<i>In that case, we should</i>
<i>invite Jiraiya Sensei,</i>
<i>too! </i>

183
00:20:06,444 --> 00:20:08,010
{\an7}<i>Yeah!</i>

184
00:20:08,044 --> 00:20:10,278
{\an1}<i>Heh. Good point. </i>

185
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:23,818
Well, it sure took a
while, but you got
yourself a nice new eye.

186
00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:26,686
{\an1}It was always mine.

187
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:30,121
{\an1}Oh. By the way, this just
arrived as well.

188
00:20:30,154 --> 00:20:31,354
{\an1}And what is it?

189
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:33,789
It's some intel from
Kisame.

190
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,491
{\an1}<i>We know where the</i>
<i>Nine Tails is.</i>

191
00:20:37,691 --> 00:20:42,092
{\an1}<i>Looks like everything's</i>
<i>back on track.</i>

192
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:45,026
{\an1}From Kisame, huh...?

193
00:20:46,894 --> 00:20:50,996
{\an1}Time to go collect
the Nine Tails.

194
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:31,773
{\an1}<i>We must assume the enemy</i>
<i>knows our location. </i>

195
00:22:31,807 --> 00:22:35,007
{\an1}<i>We're going to have to</i>
<i>move Naruto out of here</i>
<i>immediately, but we</i>

196
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,742
{\an1}<i>can't let him know</i>
<i>about the war.</i>

197
00:22:36,775 --> 00:22:39,543
Yes, we'll have to fool
him somehow...

198
00:22:39,576 --> 00:22:44,545
{\an1}<i>All right! This is just</i>
<i>the kind of mission I've</i>
<i>been waiting for! </i>

199
00:22:45,446 --> 00:22:50,381
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: The Super</i>
<i>Secret S-Rank Mission. </i>

200
00:22:51,714 --> 00:22:53,882
{\an1}<i>Good thing he's not so</i>
<i>smart </i>
