1
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:40,574
-Sakura!

2
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:46,747
-Lady Chiyo.

3
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,582
How are you holding up?

4
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,051
Can you still move?

5
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,386
-Oh?

6
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,721
Still worried about her even
with a sword through your gut?

7
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,029
CHIYO (VOICEOVER): Sasori.

8
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,163
But how?

9
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,135
No, it can't be.

10
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,376
Of course.

11
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,679
So that's it.

12
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:21,081
-If you're a medical
ninja, then you

13
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:26,453
should understand exactly
how dire your situation is.

14
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,387
-Shut up.

15
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:33,527
-You're quite a courageous
girl, but how much longer can

16
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,461
you really hold on?

17
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,143
SASORI (VOICEOVER): What?

18
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:53,180
She's stopping the bleeding
while my sword is still

19
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,581
through her?

20
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,517
She's got skill.

21
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,987
-Listen to me, Lady Chiyo.

22
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,521
Don't worry about me.

23
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,423
I'll be fine.

24
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,560
I want you to take the antidote.

25
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:07,394
-But Sakura.

26
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:17,037
-It appears the poison is
starting to take effect.

27
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,107
You see, my sword was also
coated with poison, just

28
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:22,142
in case.

29
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:25,278
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): My body's
getting numb from the point.

30
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,680
I'm losing control of my chakra.

31
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,266
[theme music]

32
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,379
-I see.

33
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:42,950
So that's the antidote.

34
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,351
-Why?

35
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:50,324
Why did you-- Lady Chiyo.

36
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:51,325
You OK?

37
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,193
SASORI (VOICEOVER):
I can't believe

38
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:56,930
these people would choose death
to save someone else's life.

39
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,332
They're so stupid.

40
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:23,190
-I won't give up.

41
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,192
SASORI (VOICEOVER):
I don't get it.

42
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:27,794
How can she be this strong?

43
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,200
-Come on.

44
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,301
Hang in there.

45
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,136
SASORI (VOICEOVER): If
it's a battle of strength,

46
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,538
there's no way I'll outlast her.

47
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:39,139
Fine.

48
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,319
-Now you die!

49
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,180
What?

50
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,782
Bu-- How?

51
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:52,145
-You lowered your guard at
the last moment, Sasori.

52
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:52,546
-What?

53
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,360
-And now you can't move anymore.

54
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:11,064
Even though your body
is now that of a puppet,

55
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:15,068
you still need a human
element to control chakra.

56
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,838
That's your weakness.

57
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:21,308
I couldn't help
noticing that part

58
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:25,145
from the left side of that
puppet's chest is gone.

59
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,052
-Take this!

60
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,442
CHIYO: You must have
done it quickly.

61
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:59,446
Right before the
jutsu was completed.

62
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,950
A simple switch to
a different puppet.

63
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,857
All of these puppet bodies.

64
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,926
They're just a
collection of dolls.

65
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,800
But your true nature is
the part inside your chest

66
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,368
that produces your chakra.

67
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:28,775
Sakura.

68
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:41,454
CHIYO (VOICEOVER):
She doesn't look good.

69
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:46,293
I've got to try and close her
wound while I simultaneously

70
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:47,460
pull out the sword.

71
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,174
-Stay with me now.

72
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,479
Just a little further.

73
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,058
-That won't work.

74
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,026
There's too much damage.

75
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,496
She'll die even without
the effects of the poison.

76
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,933
She's lost too much blood.

77
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:30,136
I'm well aware that you're
a medical ninja, which

78
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:35,041
is why I aimed for a spot
that is impossible to heal.

79
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,277
-I've already finished
the first aid treatment

80
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,913
with medical ninjutsu.

81
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:44,918
What I am doing for her now
is something very different.

82
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:45,318
-What?

83
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,926
I'm harnessing my own life
force and conducting it

84
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,361
into her body.

85
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:57,163
-No, it can't be.

86
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,498
-A reanimation ninjutsu.

87
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,385
-A reanimation ninjutsu?

88
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,457
-This jutsu of mine.

89
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:28,228
I spent many years creating
it especially for you,

90
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,363
and I'm the only
one who can use it.

91
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:45,312
Using this jutsu, life can
be breathed into anyone.

92
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,881
Even puppets.

93
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:52,252
That is, in exchange for the
life of the one who uses it.

94
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,467
CHIYO (VOICEOVER): Sasori.

95
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,773
-Ah well.

96
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:16,309
But after all that's
happened, I suppose

97
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,011
that's an impossible dream now.

98
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:28,822
SASORI: Nonsense.

99
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:45,472
-Have a safe journey!

100
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:57,550
-No!

101
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,119
It can't be.

102
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,058
Curse you.

103
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,227
Curse you, White Fang
of the Leaf village!

104
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,181
-Grandmother Chiyo.

105
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,482
Are they here?

106
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,451
Have mother and
father returned yet?

107
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,560
They're not home?

108
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,896
-Well, no dear, they're not.

109
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:47,367
You see, your parents were
sent on another very important

110
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,303
mission and it looks
like they won't

111
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,405
be back here for
quite some time.

112
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,207
I'm terribly sorry.

113
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,409
-Oh.

114
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,912
-But I just received
word from them

115
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,848
saying for you to stay
with me until their return.

116
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:05,452
Well, Sasori, is that OK?

117
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:06,052
-Yeah.

118
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,051
-What utter nonsense.

119
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,520
Tell me, grandmother.

120
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,455
When did you become so senile?

121
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:25,532
-Sakura.

122
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,800
Are you all right dear?

123
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,003
-Yes.

124
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,772
How are you, Lady Chiyo?

125
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:33,773
-Hm?

126
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:34,174
Peculiar.

127
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:41,447
That reanimation ninjutsu,
or whatever it's called.

128
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,183
I thought the
caster was supposed

129
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:47,086
to die after bringing
someone else back to life.

130
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,023
-Sakura's injuries were
severe, but she wasn't dead

131
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,025
when I used the ninjutsu.

132
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:56,396
So, even though I took a
risk, my life was spared.

133
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,797
-How very unfortunate.

134
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,776
That's pointless.

135
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,412
This puppet body of mine
can't feel any pain.

136
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,818
When you strike me,
the only thing you hurt

137
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:19,886
is your own fist.

138
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,791
But come to think
of it, you both seem

139
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,893
to love doing such
pointless things.

140
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:33,266
Even if a relative, my own
grandmother, died right here,

141
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,301
I wouldn't feel a thing.

142
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:38,538
My heart is just like this body.

143
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,508
Over the years, I've killed
hundreds, thousands of people.

144
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:45,378
She's be no different
from the rest.

145
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:49,148
Things are much simpler
than you might think.

146
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,184
-You monster.

147
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,786
What do you think human life is?

148
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,788
What is family to you?

149
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,990
-Hey.

150
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:59,325
Is that really how a
shinobi should talk?

151
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,163
-How dare you?

152
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:07,867
How can you treat
people this way?

153
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,536
CHIYO: Sakura.

154
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,105
That's enough.

155
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,507
-But he--

156
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,845
-The teachings and customs
of the Sand village did this.

157
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:23,116
We all share the blame for
making him what he is today.

158
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,051
-But, Lady Chiyo.

159
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:28,187
-Deep down inside, don't
you want to be like me?

160
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:31,090
If you do, then I'm sure
you'll understand just a little

161
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,392
of what I'm talking about.

162
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:38,197
This body won't
fall apart or age.

163
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:41,801
I'm not bound to a
limited lifespan.

164
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:44,537
A puppet can be
recreated over and over.

165
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:49,142
With puppets, you can make
as many people as you want.

166
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,510
If you want to, that is.

167
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:56,282
It's not just about quantity.

168
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:57,784
Don't get me wrong.

169
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:02,055
A serious collection
is based on quality.

170
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,057
-What the hell are you?

171
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,896
-I would describe myself
as a human being who

172
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:12,231
could not become
a complete puppet.

173
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:16,302
Yes, I am an unfinished
puppet whose lifeless frame

174
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:19,405
still contains a beating
heart at its core.

175
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,343
I am neither dead
nor am I alive.

176
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,312
The end is near.

177
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:31,184
But first, I'm going to do
something pointless too.

178
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:33,286
Think of it as a reward
for defeating me.

179
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:43,529
You wanted to know about
Orochimaru, didn't you?

180
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,471
Go to the Tenchi Bridge in the
Village Hidden in the Grass

181
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:54,240
10 days from now at noon.

182
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:54,907
-Why?

183
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,809
What's there?

184
00:17:56,843 --> 00:18:01,447
-One of Orochimaru's henchmen
is working for me as a spy,

185
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:05,051
and that's where I'm supposed
to rendezvous with him.

186
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:07,453
However, I don't think I--

187
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,910
-Well, Lady Chiyo.

188
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,044
It's really over.

189
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,184
You did it.

190
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,924
-No, dear.

191
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:21,127
The wrong person was
defeated in battle today.

192
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,295
It should've been me instead.

193
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,034
Just like he had
done before, Sasori

194
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:31,771
anticipated my final
attack, but for some reason,

195
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:34,173
he didn't even
attempt to dodge it.

196
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:36,375
He chose to let
his defenses down.

197
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,182
-You mean that he wanted this?

198
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:04,937
-Kakashi-sensei.

199
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,506
You about ready yet?

200
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,174
-My preparation's complete.

201
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,448
-So that's what you
were telling me about?

202
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:16,449
-That's right.

203
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:19,418
My new Sharingan.

204
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,187
Now let's go, Naruto.

205
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:21,787
-Right!

206
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,997

207
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,788
TENTEN: They're getting
stronger the more we fight.

208
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:03,889
It looks like we have
no choice but to unleash

209
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:04,557
our hidden methods.

210
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,925
NEJI: Hidden methods?

211
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:07,927
GUY: Allow me to explain.

212
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,862
Up against a critical
situation, Team Guy

213
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,164
can fully activate
the one time only,

214
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:16,369
the hot blooded youth
at full power power!

215
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:19,305
For an instant, we obtain an
explosively destructive energy.

216
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,773
All right, Lee.

217
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:21,807
Time to let her rip!

218
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:22,541
LEE: Yes, Guy-sensei.

219
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:24,010
TENTEN: Now hold on a second!

220
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,811
NEJI: We don't have
any methods like that.

221
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,381
NARUTO: Next time,
Beasts, Alive Again!

[theme music]

223
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,460
-Rivals of love.

224
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:45,798
-Oh wow.

225
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,566
Lately Sakura's been
kicking some serious butt.

226
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,434
-Tell me about it.

227
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,235
Look at her.

228
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:50,770
She's a pretty awesome girl.

229
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:54,006
LEE: Strong, smart,
and beautiful.

230
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,876
The day that I met Sakura, I
could not take my eyes off her.

231
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,811
It was instant love
at first sight.

232
00:22:58,844 --> 00:22:59,912
NARUTO: Ha.

233
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,447
Then she tried to get
away from you, remember?

234
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,948
Let's face it.

235
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:05,151
There's just no way she was
ever gonna give a guy like you

236
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:06,452
the time of day.

237
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,787
Not fair.

238
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,355
We did not know each
other very well back then.

239
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,058
And besides, you are the one
who transformed into Sasuke

240
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,859
to get close to her.

241
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,995
Talk about a pathetic attempt.

242
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:16,562
-Come on!

243
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:18,164
That was ages ago!

244
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,031
Ha.

245
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,566
Well, next time I'll get her.

246
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,035
She'll be blown away by
my amazing new abilities.

247
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:27,006
We are on the same team which,
means I actually have a chance.

248
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,140
-Argh!

249
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:30,910
You might be on the
same team, but do not

250
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,046
forget who you had your
memorable first kiss with.

251
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,980
-Ah!

252
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:36,482
No, no, don't watch.

253
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,183
Turn it off!

254
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,285
Don't watch it!
