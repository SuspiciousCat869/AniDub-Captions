00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:48,021
I told you.

309
00:16:48,922 --> 00:16:50,591
{\an1}I've only quit giving up!

310
00:16:51,893 --> 00:16:52,961
{\an1}So you quit?

311
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:54,530
Yeah, I quit.

312
00:16:55,398 --> 00:16:56,533
{\an1}Ooooo-kay.

313
00:16:57,635 --> 00:16:59,672
Uh- No! That's
not what I meant!

314
00:16:59,705 --> 00:17:01,340
All I'm quitting
is giving up.

315
00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:03,310
I'm not going to quit
training with you guys!

316
00:17:03,845 --> 00:17:05,279
{\an1}So you're not quitting?

317
00:17:05,814 --> 00:17:07,249
No, of course not!

318
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:09,720
I...

319
00:17:11,757 --> 00:17:13,960
{\an1}I want to be... like him.

320
00:17:14,862 --> 00:17:15,562
{\an1}Like who?

321
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:19,435
Rrrgh!

322
00:17:19,468 --> 00:17:20,336
Ah!

323
00:17:21,404 --> 00:17:24,243
Heh heh.
Y'know what
I'm gonna do?

324
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,516
I'm gonna become a fool!

325
00:17:32,755 --> 00:17:35,226
{\an1}That works out well,
since you already
look like one.

326
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,495
No! That's--

327
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,798
You're a
fool, right?

328
00:17:38,831 --> 00:17:41,569
No! Well, yes.
It's a different
kind of fool!

329
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,238
{\an1}A fool is
still a fool.

330
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:46,177
Auggh! No, you
don't get it!

331
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:47,912
{\an1}What are you trying
to tell us?!

332
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:49,346
{\an3}Ahhh!

333
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:52,820
Agh! Just
forget it! Ahh!

334
00:17:57,259 --> 00:17:59,229
{\an1}Heh! Heh heh heh!

335
00:18:01,032 --> 00:18:02,201
All right, that's it.

336
00:18:02,234 --> 00:18:03,702
{\an1}You're all gonna get it now.

337
00:18:04,003 --> 00:18:05,171
{\an1}What do you mean?!

338
00:18:05,206 --> 00:18:08,375
{\an1}Listen, don't go blaming us for
the fact that you're a fool!

339
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:10,179

Go!

{\an1}Let's go!
Wolf Fang Over Fang!

344
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:28,073
Oh boy that sure is
one intense attack!

345
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:32,080
{\an1}He's finally starting to think!
This attack will prevent
friendly fire.

"you can't tell which"!
