1
00:00:27,838 --> 00:00:29,307
{\an1}-What's going on out there?

2
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:35,812
{\an1}DANZO: The Akatsuki
has begun its assault.

3
00:00:35,845 --> 00:00:37,147
-Danzo.

4
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,481
{\an1}-Are you serious?

5
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:40,149
{\an1}The Akatsuki are really here?

6
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:41,116
-Yes.

7
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,719
{\an1}And the one leading
this assault is

8
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,355
{\an1}Pain, the head of the
Akatsuki who defeated Jiraiya.

9
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:48,890
{\an1}-You mean that so soon
after killing Jiraiya,

10
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,392
{\an1}Pain has actually
come here personally

11
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,494
to attack the
Hidden Leaf Village?

12
00:00:53,528 --> 00:00:54,696
-Yes.

13
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:57,331
{\an1}The Akatsuki's been hunting
the Jinchuriki hosts

14
00:00:57,364 --> 00:00:59,198
{\an1}to accumulate tailed beasts.

15
00:00:59,232 --> 00:01:01,300
{\an1}They have the Sand's
One Tail, and it's

16
00:01:01,334 --> 00:01:03,436
{\an1}believed that most
of the Jinchuriki

17
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:05,538
{\an1}have fallen into their hands.

18
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:08,940
{\an1}-Then that means that
their target here is--

19
00:01:08,973 --> 00:01:09,741
-That's right.

20
00:01:09,774 --> 00:01:11,309
{\an1}The Fourth Hokage's legacy.

21
00:01:11,343 --> 00:01:11,942
Naruto Uzumaki.

22
00:01:14,545 --> 00:01:17,214
And yet, despite
the danger involved,

23
00:01:17,247 --> 00:01:20,950
{\an1}the Fifth Hokage is trying
to summon Naruto back.

24
00:01:20,983 --> 00:01:23,419
-To do such a
thing-- why, it would

25
00:01:23,453 --> 00:01:25,954
{\an1}be exactly like pouring
oil onto a fire.

26
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:27,456
-I know.

27
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:30,891
{\an1}And I know if we keep
listening to the Fifth Hokage,

28
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,094
the Hidden Leaf
will be destroyed.

29

[screaming]

30
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:39,899
-Everybody, go!

31
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:44,738
-What was that?

32
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:48,674
-Stop.

33
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:50,142
Get back inside.

34
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:52,310
{\an1}-Shikamaru, what's going on?

35
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:53,344
{\an1}-It's the Akatsuki.

36
00:01:53,378 --> 00:01:54,045
They're here.

37
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:17,132
{\an1}Kurenai-sensei, do me a
favor and step back, please.

38
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:30,443
Now you die.

39
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,348
Get down!

40
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,254
-You all right?

41
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:43,953
-Yeah.

42
00:02:43,987 --> 00:02:45,288
{\an1}Don't worry about me.

43
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:47,892
{\an1}You need to take the underground
tunnel to the evacuation

44
00:02:47,924 --> 00:02:48,725
shelter.

45
00:02:48,758 --> 00:02:51,093
{\an1}I'll take you part of the way.

46
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:52,361
No arguments.

47
00:02:52,394 --> 00:02:54,496
{\an1}If something happened
to you or your child,

48
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,600
I would never be
able to face Asuma.

{\an1}GAMAKICHI: Eh, where's Naruto?

56
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:51,177
{\an1}-Can't you see him?

57
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:53,480
-Huh?

58
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:54,147
-Look carefully.

59
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:01,687
-Huh?

60
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,187
Huh.

61
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:10,828
Naruto.

62
00:04:10,862 --> 00:04:13,263
I didn't even
notice him at first.

63
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:15,097
{\an1}FUKASAKU: Impressive, isn't it?

64
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:19,101
{\an1}Can you please how far he's come
in becoming one with nature?

65
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,569
{\an1}-All right, I think
I've had enough

66
00:04:20,603 --> 00:04:22,238
{\an1}of this training for now.

67
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:24,272
{\an1}It's time to go take care
of some other business.

68
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:31,011
{\an1}-Watch out, Lord Fukasaku!

69
00:04:31,044 --> 00:04:31,813
-Ah!

70
00:04:31,846 --> 00:04:34,081
-Ow, ow, ow, ow.

71
00:04:34,114 --> 00:04:37,316
{\an1}You all right after
that, Lord Fukasaku?

72
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,052
{\an1}FUKASAKU (VOICEOVER): Jiraiya
boy's eyes saw the truth.

73
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:44,790
{\an1}He will become even
stronger than Jiraiya boy.

74
00:04:44,824 --> 00:04:46,691
{\an1}-Hey, get off of me, already.

75
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:49,561
{\an1}You're heavy, you know?

76
00:04:49,594 --> 00:04:50,461
{\an1}-Damn you, Naruto!

77
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:57,935
-Choji!

78
00:04:57,968 --> 00:04:59,736
-I brought some
of my food pills.

79
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:00,236
-Great.

80
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,770
Thank you.

81
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,976
{\an1}There are so many.

82
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,343
-My stomach.

83
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:10,211
{\an1}-Can someone please--

84
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:11,947
{\an1}SAKURA: What's going on here?

85
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,847
{\an1}-Oh, Miss Sakura.

86
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,715
{\an1}You're just in time.

87
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:16,617
{\an1}You're going to have
to take command.

88
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:17,250
-Huh?

89
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,818
{\an1}What about Shizune?

90
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,555
{\an1}-I'm afraid she's not here.

91
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,355
-That's right.

92
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,490
The autopsy.

93
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:26,292
{\an1}-There are so many
wounded, the medical ninja

94
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:27,626
{\an1}are simply overwhelmed.

95
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,829
{\an1}We really need someone to
take charge and give orders.

96
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:31,696
-What?

97
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:33,464
Me?

98
00:05:33,498 --> 00:05:34,933
{\an1}MAN: I really need some help.

99
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:35,500
Please.

100
00:05:41,405 --> 00:05:45,441
{\an1}SAKURA (VOICEOVER): How can I be
responsible for so many lives?

101
00:05:45,474 --> 00:05:47,877
{\an1}At a time like this,
Lady Tsunade would--

102
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:48,811
-I don't know.

103
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:52,180
{\an1}I don't know where my family is.

104
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:53,281
-Wait here.

105
00:05:53,315 --> 00:05:54,816
{\an1}Take this, and do your best.

106
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:56,952
{\an1}-Hey, these are for the wounded.

107
00:05:56,985 --> 00:05:57,751
{\an1}They're not for me.

108
00:05:57,785 --> 00:06:00,788
I'll be fine.

109
00:06:00,821 --> 00:06:02,823
{\an1}Everyone, if you can
walk, then please

110
00:06:02,856 --> 00:06:05,191
{\an1}go to the evacuation shelter.

111
00:06:05,224 --> 00:06:08,160
{\an1}We're expecting more
wounded at any moment.

112
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:12,598
{\an1}Those who are critical we'll
designate with the color red.

113
00:06:12,631 --> 00:06:15,734
{\an1}Yellow if they can wait,
green for minor injuries.

114
00:06:15,767 --> 00:06:17,868
{\an1}Go and tie colored
ribbons on the patients,

115
00:06:17,903 --> 00:06:19,470
{\an1}and separate them by group.

116

-Yes, ma'am.

00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:21,439
-Wow.

00:06:21,472 --> 00:06:23,040
{\an1}You're amazing, Sakura.

119
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:24,641
{\an1}I'm going to head back.

120
00:06:24,674 --> 00:06:26,142
{\an1}You've clearly got this.

121
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:26,643
-Right.

122
00:06:30,013 --> 00:06:31,081
{\an1}Are you all right?

123
00:06:31,113 --> 00:06:34,148
{\an1}Can you breathe OK?

[theme music]

125

{\an1}-All right, then.

126
00:08:20,873 --> 00:08:23,442
{\an1}I'll return and call
Naruto back home.

127
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:23,909
-Good.

128
00:08:23,942 --> 00:08:25,877
Hurry.

129
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:27,545
-Stop.

130
00:08:27,578 --> 00:08:29,580
{\an1}We must leave Naruto on Mt.

-That's right.

134
00:08:32,883 --> 00:08:34,852
{\an1}We understand it's
the Akatsuki's leader

135
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:36,653
{\an1}who has attacked our village.

136
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:38,354
{\an1}-How did you find that out?

137
00:08:38,388 --> 00:08:40,757
{\an1}-Danzo is the one
who informed us.

138
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,225
{\an1}-He also said that they're
after the power Naruto

{\an1}possesses as a Jinchuriki.

And what of it?

{\an1}-Last time we gave
you wide reign,

{\an1}but now conditions
are different.

assailant we're talking about

is the one who
brought Jiraiya down.

146

{\an1}If Naruto's taken down,
and the Nine Tails

{\an1}falls into their hands--
what are you doing?

148
00:09:06,344 --> 00:09:08,180
{\an1}-Naruto, you don't
have to protect me!

Stop, already!

true when you're dead.

-Don't you worry
about me, granny.

{\an1}-Get out of the way, Naruto!

Don't do it!

154

Hokage, whatever happens,

00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:35,336
{\an1}there's no way I'm going to die.

156
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:37,972
{\an1}I will avenge Pervy Sage.

157

{\an1}I can't just sit around
here doing nothing.

our emotions in check.

{\an1}The job that we must
give to ourselves

160
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:51,282
{\an1}now is to set examples and aid
the next generation, Tsunade.

161
00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:55,486
{\an1}To achieve that, I'd
gladly risk my life.

162
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,789
{\an1}FUKASAKU: I can see
that this child truly

163
00:09:57,822 --> 00:10:01,391
{\an1}loved and admired Jiraiya boy.

164
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:03,326
It makes me hope
more than anything

165
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,829
that he is the
child of prophecy.

166
00:10:16,437 --> 00:10:18,907
{\an1}For Jiraiya boy has
clearly bequeathed his

167
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,974
{\an1}all to his student.

168
00:10:24,377 --> 00:10:26,013
-You stop this!

169
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:27,647
{\an1}Unhand us now, Tsunade.

170
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,881
-What?

171
00:10:28,915 --> 00:10:31,316
{\an1}You dare to raise your
hand against us counselors.

172
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:32,317
{\an1}What are you thinking?

173
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,085
-No!

174
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:34,586
{\an1}What are you two thinking?

175
00:10:34,619 --> 00:10:37,722
{\an1}How long do you intend to
treat him like a child?

176
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:39,090
-What?

177
00:10:39,124 --> 00:10:42,760
{\an1}-The Will of Fire has passed
to him, and now it's growing.

178
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:46,096
{\an1}Naruto's striving to surpass
Jiraiya this very minute!

179
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,430
That's right.

180
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:49,799
{\an1}He's not some hidden weapon
for us to use as a deterrent

181
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,600
to war.

182
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:54,002
{\an1}He's a true Shinobi, and
defender of the Leaf.

183
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:54,837
{\an1}He's Naruto Uzumaki!

184
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:05,545
{\an1}Jiraiya, Lady Chiyo of the
Sand, and Sarutobi-sensei all

185
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,714
{\an1}had what you two clearly lack.

186
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,056
{\an1}-Today I'd like to start
by reciting for all of you

187
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:18,858
{\an1}a poem that I've written.

188
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:21,893
{\an1}I expect you to remember
it when you go home.

189
00:11:21,926 --> 00:11:25,495
{\an1}-Eh, I can't memorized
stuff like that.

190
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:27,298
No, thank you.

191
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:29,766
{\an1}-That's for sure!

192
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,201
{\an1}-Pipe down, Naruto!

193
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:31,869
-Ah!

194
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:34,437
Iruka-sensei!

195
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,239
{\an1}-That's all right, Iruka.

196
00:11:36,272 --> 00:11:40,276
{\an1}I suppose that they do
have a point, after all.

197
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:40,809
-Right.

198
00:11:40,842 --> 00:11:42,077
Sorry, sir.

199
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,278
{\an1}-Very well, then.

200
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:46,248
{\an1}I won't expect you to
memorize the entire poem,

201
00:11:46,281 --> 00:11:48,782
{\an1}nor to understand its meaning.

202
00:11:48,816 --> 00:11:51,886
{\an1}However, when you have
all grown to adulthood,

203
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,420
{\an1}I want you to think back
and recall the words

204
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:56,689
{\an1}that this old man told you.

205
00:11:56,723 --> 00:11:58,824
{\an1}This poem is about
a way of thinking

206
00:11:58,857 --> 00:12:01,827
{\an1}that is sure to be useful
to you in your future.

207
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,896
It concerns the
Leaf's Will of Fire.

208
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:09,734
{\an1}In the place where
the tree leaves dance,

209
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:11,468
{\an1}there one shall find flames.

210
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:14,971
{\an1}The fire's shadow will
illuminate the village.

211
00:12:15,005 --> 00:12:19,975
{\an1}And once again, the tree's
leaves shall bud anew.

212
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:22,778
{\an1}-In this world of
shinobi created

213
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:26,547
{\an1}by frivolous old people,
it's a great comfort to me

214
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:30,952
{\an1}to know that new souls like
yourself have come along.

215
00:12:30,985 --> 00:12:36,890
{\an1}Up till now, everything I've
done in my life has been wrong.

216
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:40,126
{\an1}But at least here
in my final hour,

217
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,896
{\an1}I can finally do something
right for a change.

218
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,400
{\an1}The Sand and the Leaf.

219
00:12:53,904 --> 00:12:57,573
{\an1}May the future that
awaits them be different

220
00:12:57,607 --> 00:13:00,610
{\an1}from the way things
were in our time.

221
00:13:00,643 --> 00:13:05,881
{\an1}This special power of yours that
Kakashi spoke of-- that power

222
00:13:05,914 --> 00:13:09,717
will change the
future dramatically.

223
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,521
{\an1}Become a Hokage the likes of
which has never been seen.

224
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:20,360
{\an1}-Jiraiya, Lady Chiyo,
and Sarutobi-sensei,

225
00:13:20,393 --> 00:13:21,828
{\an1}they had what you lack.

226
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:25,831
{\an1}And that's the power to believe!

227
00:13:55,789 --> 00:13:59,760
{\an1}Just as my grandfather, the
first Hokage, believed in you

228
00:13:59,793 --> 00:14:08,734
{\an1}and entrusted the Hidden
Leaf Village to you,

229
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:11,870
{\an1}it is time for you to
believe in and entrust

230
00:14:11,903 --> 00:14:13,338
{\an1}the Leaf to the next generation.

231
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:42,963
{\an1}-Do as you please.

232
00:14:52,271 --> 00:14:53,472
-Lady Tsunade.

233
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,341
{\an1}-Did you find something?

234
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:57,142
-Yes.

235
00:14:57,175 --> 00:14:58,643
Look at this.

236
00:14:58,676 --> 00:14:59,911
-What is it?

237
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:02,147
{\an1}-They're receiver-like objects.

238
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,382
{\an1}They respond to chakra signals.

239
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,450
They're embedded
throughout the body of Pain

240
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:07,951
{\an1}that Jiraiya brought back.

241
00:15:07,985 --> 00:15:09,453
-Receivers?

242
00:15:09,486 --> 00:15:12,021
{\an1}-According to what
Lord Fukasaku said,

243
00:15:12,055 --> 00:15:15,458
{\an1}every one of the six Pains
have these stuck in them,

244
00:15:15,491 --> 00:15:18,326
{\an1}studded all over their
bodies and faces.

245
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,462
{\an1}-Does that mean the
six Pains receive

246
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:23,664
{\an1}some kind of chakra signal
across their whole bodies?

247
00:15:23,697 --> 00:15:25,966
Is that how they
synchronize their actions?

248
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,735
-That part isn't
entirely clear yet.

249
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:30,003
-A receiver.

250
00:15:30,036 --> 00:15:33,006
{\an1}They could use it to transmit
chakra to each other.

251
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:35,008
{\an1}Or a wireless radio.

252
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:38,043
{\an1}-And this thing is still
reacting, even now.

253
00:15:38,077 --> 00:15:41,246
{\an1}I think this must be connected
to the secret of Pain's

254
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,613
strength.

255
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:46,417
{\an1}With data from the interrogation
core, we'll figure this out.

256
00:15:46,451 --> 00:15:48,852
{\an1}-Now, according to
the Intel Division,

257
00:15:48,885 --> 00:15:50,954
the enemy's here
searching for Naruto.

258
00:15:50,987 --> 00:15:53,323
{\an1}And this enemy who
infiltrated the Leaf Village

259
00:15:53,356 --> 00:15:55,425
{\an1}is undoubtedly Pain.

260
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:57,293
-Pain's here?

261
00:15:57,326 --> 00:16:01,629
{\an1}-We should relay all of this
to Lord Fukasaku as well.

262
00:16:01,663 --> 00:16:04,933
{\an1}You, messenger frog,
when you recall Naruto,

263
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:06,401
{\an1}relay this intel.

264
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:07,968
-Understood.

265
00:16:08,002 --> 00:16:11,271
{\an1}-Shizuna, take the data from
the autopsy to the Interrogation

266
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:12,106
Corps.

267
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,606
{\an1}Find out who and what Pain is.

268
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,142
-Yes, ma'am.

269
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,578
{\an1}-ANBU Black Ops, Cell
B, escort Shizune,

270
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,846
{\an1}and then guard the
Interrogation Corps.

271
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,913
{\an1}Don't let Pain get near them.

272
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,115
-Yes, ma'am.

273
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,350
{\an1}-Meanwhile, I'll await
reports on the roof,

274
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:28,520
{\an1}and I'll start healing all of
the injured through Katsuyu.

275
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:30,422
{\an1}I will protect the village.

276
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:31,055
Let's go!

277
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:38,828
{\an1}-I don't know why, but I got a
really bad feeling right now.

278
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:47,702
-Those two are
completely useless.

279
00:16:47,735 --> 00:16:49,871
All that they've
done is grow old.

280
00:16:49,904 --> 00:16:54,908
{\an1}So, Tsunade has persuaded
them to her side instead.

281
00:16:54,941 --> 00:16:58,278
{\an1}At least now, the Nine
Tails can be kept caged up.

282
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,232
{\an1}-I'll ask you once more,
where is Naruto Uzumaki?

283
00:17:32,207 --> 00:17:32,806
-Go to hell.

284
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:42,916
-Speak.

285
00:17:42,949 --> 00:17:45,385
{\an1}Where is Naruto Uzumaki?

286
00:17:45,418 --> 00:17:48,388
Is he in this
village, or isn't he?

287
00:17:48,421 --> 00:17:50,189
Answer me now.

288
00:17:50,222 --> 00:17:51,590
{\an1}-I-- I don't know.

289
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,034
-Amazing.

290
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:05,734
{\an1}He absorbed all the jutsu.

291
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:07,604
{\an1}-Then we'll just have
to attack him directly.

292
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:30,923
{\an1}-Summoning Jutsu!

293
00:18:41,098 --> 00:18:44,068
{\an1}Katsuyu, go attend to all of
the Hidden Leaf residents,

294
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:46,035
{\an1}both shinobi and civilian.

295
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:47,870
Take my chakra,
and use it to treat

296
00:18:47,904 --> 00:18:50,473
anyone who was
injured in the attack.

297
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:53,175
-The village is
in serious danger.

298
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:53,809
-Never mind.

299
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,177
Just go.

300
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,178
-I understand.

301
00:19:18,464 --> 00:19:21,634
{\an1}-I will protect this village
with all of my power.

302
00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:27,271
{\an1}I swear upon my title of Hokage!

303
00:19:41,651 --> 00:19:45,052
{\an1}-Are you all right?

304
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:48,322
{\an1}-Tell me where the Nine
Tails Jinchuriki is,

305
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,024
{\an1}or else I will kill you.

306
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:55,762
{\an1}IRUKA (VOICEOVER):
That insignia-- I see.

307
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:58,464
{\an1}So he's Akatsuki.

308
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,165
-Now, tell me.

309
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,202
{\an1}IRUKA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

310
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,337
{\an1}-You're wasting your time.

311
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,839
{\an1}I have no intention of
telling you anything.

312
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:10,241
-I see, then.

313
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:11,609
{\an1}I have no use for you.

314
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:23,851
{\an1}-You create a loud
diversion so you

315
00:20:23,885 --> 00:20:26,622
{\an1}can hunt from the shadows, huh?

316
00:20:26,655 --> 00:20:28,523
-Kakashi.

317
00:20:28,556 --> 00:20:31,392
{\an1}-Take that injured man and go.

318
00:20:31,426 --> 00:20:32,959
{\an1}Leave this to me.

319
00:20:32,993 --> 00:20:34,094
-Roger.

320
00:20:34,127 --> 00:20:34,796
Right away.

321
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:41,534
{\an1}IRUKA (VOICEOVER):
Good luck, Kakashi.

322
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,108
{\an1}-Now it's just the two of us.

323
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:52,376
{\an1}-Then I shall ask you, instead.

324
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:54,178
{\an1}Where is the Nine Tails?

325
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:59,115
{\an1}-What you're doing is
totally pointless, you know?

326
00:20:59,148 --> 00:21:01,384
{\an1}The people here are
different than the ones

327
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:02,185
{\an1}in other villages.

328
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:14,261
{\an1}Even if it means dying,
there's not a single one of us

329
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:15,529
{\an1}who'd ever sell out a comrade.

330
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:29,341

331
00:22:56,214 --> 00:22:58,349
{\an1}TSUNADE: Pain displays
his overwhelming strength

332
00:22:58,383 --> 00:23:02,019
{\an1}by wiping out the
Leaf reinforcements.

333
00:23:02,052 --> 00:23:04,923
{\an1}Despite their valiant efforts,
the shinobi of the Leaf

334
00:23:04,955 --> 00:23:07,624
{\an1}are gradually cornered.

335
00:23:07,658 --> 00:23:09,860
{\an1}Those who fight for
the village and those

336
00:23:09,893 --> 00:23:12,795
{\an1}who fight to protect
their loved ones.

337
00:23:12,829 --> 00:23:14,963
{\an1}As they fight past
their own limits,

338
00:23:14,996 --> 00:23:19,000
{\an1}what's possible strategy can
they come up with to win?

339
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:24,238
{\an1}Next time on Naruto Shippuden,
Pain versus Kakashi!
