1
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:12,361
{\an1}By the way, I ate you.
What're you gonna do now?

2
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:16,932
{\an1}Oh, yeah! I forgot about
that! What do I do?!

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,603
{\an1}There is a way to stop me.

4
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:24,340
{\an1}Just undo these chains and
I'll tell you what I mean.

5
00:00:24,373 --> 00:00:25,307
Son!

6
00:00:26,742 --> 00:00:28,611
{\an1}Please, you just have to
tell me how to stop you
before it's too late!

7
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:31,914
{\an1}First, just one thing...

8
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:33,315
Hm?

9
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:37,820
{\an1}I don't trust Jinchuriki
humans on principle.

10
00:00:37,853 --> 00:00:43,292
{\an4}Especially not fools like
you that claim they want to
be friends with Tailed
Beasts.

11
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,759
In other words...

12
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:49,365
{\an1}Don't assume that even if
you do set me free from
these chains...

13
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:52,501
{\an1}I'll automatically
become your ally.

14
00:00:57,805 --> 00:01:00,975
{\an1}That's the kind of
response I'd expect.

15
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,444
[angry snarling]

16
00:01:02,478 --> 00:01:04,413
Nine Tails...

17
00:01:04,446 --> 00:01:10,519
{\an4}This transient form is
nothing more than a nodule.
You're only a piece of
yourself, a pittance

18
00:01:10,552 --> 00:01:12,454
{\an1}of your true power.

19
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:13,888
Quiet.

20
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:15,390
{\an1}[defiant growling]

21
00:01:15,424 --> 00:01:19,060
{\an1}You are merely an ignorant
and unstable power...

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,461
Shut up!

23
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,567
{\an1}The ones who shall guide you
are the Uchiha. You Tailed
Beasts are simply servants

24
00:01:26,602 --> 00:01:29,103
of those with
Visual Prowess!

25
00:01:29,137 --> 00:01:30,773
{\an1}Shut the hell up!

26
00:01:31,339 --> 00:01:34,008
Now, obey me!

27
00:01:36,411 --> 00:01:40,481
{\an1}Nine Tails... Your power is
too great, too destructive.

28
00:01:40,515 --> 00:01:43,318
{\an1}I'm sorry. I can't let you
run around loose.

29
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,056
{\an1}Whenever you exercise your
power, you always draw
hatred to you.

30
00:01:48,623 --> 00:01:51,259
{\an1}Please, just stay quiet
inside me.

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,332
{\an7}This is an unfortunate
situation for the both of
us, so please listen.

32
00:01:57,365 --> 00:02:02,470
{\an7}You're here to keep the
world in check, but I'm here
to keep watch over you.

33
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:11,144
{\an7}Though you have no true
strength of your own, you
force your ideals on me and
restrain me.

34
00:02:11,845 --> 00:02:14,482
{\an1}All right, now for the
Eight Signed Seal.

35
00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:17,719
{\an1}I'll seal the rest of the
Nine Tails in Naruto.

36
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:25,292
{\an4}A Ritual Altar? He's
planning to seal me up
again! Not inside that
baby?!

37
00:02:26,326 --> 00:02:28,261
[coughing]

38
00:02:28,295 --> 00:02:30,997
{\an1}Kushina! Are you okay?

39
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:35,669
There you are!

40
00:02:35,703 --> 00:02:37,070
{\an1}Eight Signed Seal!

41
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:44,745
{\an1}The same thing happened
sixteen years ago...

42
00:04:32,618 --> 00:04:34,219
[growling]

43
00:04:34,252 --> 00:04:36,521
Where am I?

44
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:42,862
[crying]

45
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:47,799
{\an1}I must be inside this kid...
What's this?!

46
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,234
[crying]

47
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:51,503
{\an1}An Eight Signed Seal?!

48
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:57,842
{\an1}I see, so the Fourth Hokage
plans on letting this brat
use my power, does he?

49
00:04:57,876 --> 00:05:03,815
{\an1}Even if half my existence
is sealed away, he
underestimates me.

50
00:05:04,215 --> 00:05:11,256
{\an4}Me, the Nine Tails,
Jinchuriki in the past used
all manner of restraints to
keep me in check.

51
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:23,066
{\an1}Compared to that this seal
is nothing. Even so, it will
take a while to break.

52
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:31,543
{\an1}But if I keep letting chakra
seep through the cracks, it
will eventually weaken...

53
00:05:32,309 --> 00:05:38,850
{\an1}Very well. It's not fun, but
it must be done to escape
this prison.

54
00:05:39,316 --> 00:05:42,419
{\an1}I will let this brat
have some of my power.

55
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:46,590
{\an1}You were a total joke
in taijutsu class!

56
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,827
{\an1}Just stay out of school,
loser! I can't stand
looking at you!

57
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:53,130
{\an1}You couldn't become a ninja
even if you had a hundred
years!

58
00:05:53,163 --> 00:05:55,900
{\an1}Just shut up! I'll
make you pay for that!

59
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,002
If you think you
can, bring it on!

60
00:05:58,036 --> 00:06:00,972
{\an1}You're gonna regret saying
that! [attacking yell]

61
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:06,877
[laughing]

62
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:10,881
{\an1}Damn it! How long is he
going to make me wait?

63
00:06:12,215 --> 00:06:15,886
{\an1}If he doesn't use the power
I'm giving him, the seal
won't weaken!

64
00:06:17,621 --> 00:06:20,891
{\an1}I'll pay you all back!
You'll see!

65
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:22,593
{\an1}[chuckling] Yeah!
You better run!

66
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:32,736
{\an1}He's not like that.
He's nothing like the
Nine-Tailed Fox.

67
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,438
{\an1}He's Naruto Uzumaki
of the Leaf!

68
00:06:35,739 --> 00:06:36,707
Iruka!

69
00:06:37,874 --> 00:06:40,443
{\an1}I was gonna finish you
later, but I changed my
mind.

70
00:06:40,476 --> 00:06:42,012
{\an1}You're finished!

71
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:53,522
{\an1}If you ever lay a hand on
my sensei, I'll kill you!

72
00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:57,460
{\an1}You idiot! Why did you come
back here? Run away!

73
00:06:57,727 --> 00:06:59,261
{\an1}Shadow Clone Jutsu!

74
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:11,040
{\an1}Finally! My chakra is
gathering and taking
the form of a fox...

75
00:07:26,555 --> 00:07:28,791
Yeah?! Eat this!

76
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:37,499
{\an4}<i>For now, the keys to unlock</i>
<i>my power are when his life</i>
<i>is in danger or he's pushed</i>
<i>to the edge emotionally.</i>

77
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:42,772
{\an1}But using my power
unconsciously isn't enough.

78
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:50,345
{\an1}I need him to be consciously
aware of my existence and
to use my power regularly...

79
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:54,382
{\an1}I'm glad you asked!

80
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:58,888
{\an1}I am the hermit of Mount
Myoboku! The wise and
immortal spirit!

81
00:07:59,587 --> 00:08:03,625
{\an1}That's right! It is I, the
Toad Mountain Sage!

82
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,295
{\an1}What?! The Toad Sage?

83
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:11,266
{\an1}So this is the man who was
the Fourth Hokage's Master...

84
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:18,373
{\an4}...which means he's probably
going to pass on his ideas
to the kid and try to
control me.

85
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,011
{\an1}Still, for now, this is
a good opportunity.

86
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,980
{\an1}What? What's going on?

87
00:08:26,014 --> 00:08:28,349
Your training
ends right here.

88
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:32,587
{\an1}If you don't wish to die, do
something about it... now.

89
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,391
[screaming]

90
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,473
So, the brat's
finally come to me...

91
00:08:52,506 --> 00:08:54,142
[screaming]

92
00:08:54,175 --> 00:09:00,614
{\an1}How wonderful it would be to
kill and eat you! But this
accursed gate confines me.

93
00:09:00,647 --> 00:09:03,650
{\an1}It's that infuriating
sealing spell!

94
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:06,221
{\an1}No way! Y-You're the--

95
00:09:06,553 --> 00:09:07,989
Nine Tailed Fox!

96
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:12,860
{\an1}Why are you here, foolish
boy? What do you want?

97
00:09:14,862 --> 00:09:19,867
{\an1}Alright look, you stupid
fox! You're in my body, and
you owe me rent!

98
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,670
{\an1}So for payment, I'll take
your chakra! You got that?

99
00:09:23,704 --> 00:09:25,672
[laughter]

100
00:09:26,874 --> 00:09:32,880
{\an1}Very well. As a reward for
making it this far, I will
loan you my chakra!

101
00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:38,118
[screaming]

102
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,689
Summoning Jutsu!

103
00:09:49,495 --> 00:09:50,731
[growling]

104
00:09:50,998 --> 00:09:52,900
{\an1}Yes, I actually did it!

105
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:55,836
{\an1}I finally pulled it off! I
did the Summoning Jutsu for
real!

106
00:09:55,869 --> 00:09:59,505
{\an1}What a fool! He acts as if
my power is his own...

107
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:07,580
{\an4}But at least now, he can
clearly sense my presence.
And as a result he'll use my
power even more...

108
00:10:07,613 --> 00:10:09,415
[chuckle]

109
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:11,851
Haghh!!

110
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,365
{\an4}Right, think of something
with fangs and claws! Fangs
and claws, fangs and
claws...

111
00:10:29,702 --> 00:10:31,337
[growls]

112
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:40,513
[roaring]

113
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:53,092
{\an1}You're not goin' anywhere!

114
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,629
{\an1}Sasuke! You are my...

115
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:08,773
That's it...

116
00:11:11,877 --> 00:11:13,980
[growl]

117
00:11:15,348 --> 00:11:17,549
{\an1}Keep using my power!

118
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:22,420
{\an1}The more you rely on my
power and draw chakra from
me...

119
00:11:23,054 --> 00:11:26,491
{\an1}...the weaker the seal will
continue to become.

120
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:29,628
Huh?!

121
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:34,132
{\an1}We've just received a
message! The Hidden Sand's
Kazekage has been abducted!

122
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:35,767
{\an1}By a group called
the Akatsuki!

123
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,371
[gasps]

124
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:40,572
All right.

125
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:44,509
{\an1}Team Kakashi, I'm hereby
assigning you a new mission.

126
00:11:48,613 --> 00:11:54,585
{\an1}If I'm not mistaken, this
kid is acquainted with the
One Tail Jinchuriki.

127
00:11:57,322 --> 00:12:02,160
{\an1}The brat's become quite
powerful after the last
three years of training.

128
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:08,632
{\an4}But that also means that
I'll be able to influence
things more than I could
before.

129
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,369
Now then...

130
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:21,079
{\an1}You will pay for this!

131
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:24,481
{\an1}That's what Master Jiraiya
was talking about...

132
00:12:27,017 --> 00:12:29,987
{\an1}If this is all it takes
to make him rampage...

133
00:12:30,454 --> 00:12:33,391
{\an1}...then the seal has
weakened considerably.

134
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:40,998
{\an4}Just a little while longer...
If I can draw out even
greater hatred from this
kid...

135
00:12:41,031 --> 00:12:46,570
{\an1}I can overwhelm him with my
power and finally destroy
the seal.

136
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:51,141
{\an1}Just a little longer now...

137
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:07,358
{\an1}Don't you talk about Sasuke
like you own him!!!

138
00:13:07,391 --> 00:13:11,395
{\an1}Especially in front 'a
me, you rotten bastard!

139
00:13:12,495 --> 00:13:15,265
{\an1}He's directing so much
hatred toward him!

140
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:21,738
{\an1}The perfect opponent! Kid,
you hate him? You want him
to disappear?

141
00:13:22,772 --> 00:13:27,177
{\an1}In that case, come here, and
I'll give you power.

142
00:13:28,711 --> 00:13:30,046
Chidori Stream!

143
00:13:40,556 --> 00:13:44,127
{\an1}Now's your chance, Naruto.

144
00:13:44,827 --> 00:13:51,634
{\an1}You know what to do. Come...
Give him a glimpse of our
power.

145
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:53,536
Now then...

146
00:13:54,203 --> 00:13:57,173
{\an1}Who do you want to kill?

147
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:59,675
No... Don't ever
come out, you hear?

148
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:03,246
{\an1}I don't need your power! I
don't want anything to do
with you!

149
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:12,989
{\an4}Who was the one with the
impudence to come begging me
for help at every step of
the way?

150
00:14:13,022 --> 00:14:19,429
{\an1}You understand by now, don't
you? Without me, you
couldn't do anything at all.

151
00:14:19,828 --> 00:14:23,999
{\an1}You could never face such
powerful foes without me!

152
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:26,868
{\an1}This world shall know pain.

153
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,878
Hinata!

154
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:47,523
{\an1}Undo the seal. And once you
do, I will give you all my
power.

155
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:54,329
{\an1}Destroy everything.

156
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:58,600
{\an1}Erase anything that
causes you pain.

157
00:14:58,633 --> 00:15:03,071
{\an1}Give me your soul, your
spirit, your vital essence.

158
00:15:03,105 --> 00:15:10,245
{\an1}Give it to me and in
exchange I will rescue
you from your pain.

159
00:15:12,247 --> 00:15:14,983
Now, come here.

160
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:22,023
{\an1}Yes, that's it, come
closer... And rip this
accursed seal off.

161
00:15:44,312 --> 00:15:46,180
[gasp]

162
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,088
You!

163
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,260
{\an1}I'll rebuild the seal now...

164
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,530
But this will be
the last time.

165
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:04,331
[angry roaring]

166
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,704
[growling]

167
00:16:11,739 --> 00:16:17,578
{\an1}I never expected to be
sealed again by a ghost!
But I still have a chance.

168
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:28,821
[chuckling]

169
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:33,494
{\an1}To think, he's just bringing
the key right to me!

170
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:43,970
{\an1}Now if I can take control of
that kid's mind, I can break
free anytime I want.

171
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,549
So, what's up?

172
00:16:55,848 --> 00:17:00,688
{\an1}Where'd the real you go? I
don't sense him anymore.

173
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:05,992
{\an1}The real me? I'm right here.
Right in front of you!

174
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:29,815
[roaring]

175
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:44,196
{\an7}Oh, I see... You're hoping to
gain control over my power,
are you?

176
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:50,670
{\an4}You teamed up with the Eight
Tails? You, the Jinchuriki
of the Nine Tails? How
pitiful!

177
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,273
Sage Art!

178
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,243
{\an1}Massive Rasengan!!

179
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,446
[angry growl]

180
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:03,782
So fast!

181
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:09,087
{\an1}[angry growl] Do you really
think that you can beat me?

182
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:13,325
{\an1}Yeah, of course I do! That's
why I undid the seal!

183
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,561
[grunting]

184
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,503
{\an1}Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken!

185
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:40,918
{\an1}Just give it up! You
will never be able to
control my power!

186
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,556
{\an1}You are only a tiny little
piece of my hatred!

187
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:52,397
[screaming]

188
00:18:57,268 --> 00:18:59,136
{\an1}What is this chakra?

189
00:19:00,204 --> 00:19:01,540
Kushina?!

190
00:19:02,006 --> 00:19:04,475
{\an1}Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

191
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:13,584
[angry roar]

192
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:17,789
{\an1}Rasengan Super Barrage!

193
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:21,058
{\an1}You haven't won yet!

194
00:19:24,795 --> 00:19:25,730
All right.

195
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:28,232
{\an1}You're done! Sage Art!

196
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:31,335
{\an1}Massive Rasengan Barrage!!

197
00:19:32,103 --> 00:19:34,071
[screaming]

198
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,310
Once more!

199
00:19:45,115 --> 00:19:47,651
{\an1}What kind of power is this?!

200
00:19:49,553 --> 00:19:50,920
Get out!

201
00:19:50,954 --> 00:19:53,491
[roaring]

202
00:20:05,435 --> 00:20:11,341
{\an1}You have infuriated
me! Naruto!

203
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:19,482
[angry roar]

204
00:20:21,317 --> 00:20:25,221
{\an1}Isn't this the Six Paths?!

205
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:38,668
{\an1}You'd better watch
out, Naruto!

206
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,896
{\an1}Damn it! How could this
happen to me again?!

207
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:12,635
{\an1}He took quite a lot
of power from me...

208
00:21:13,302 --> 00:21:17,573
Even though he's
just... He's just...

209
00:21:19,174 --> 00:21:22,444
{\an1}Just what is he, anyway?

210
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:00,374
{\an1}<i>Look, we Tailed Beasts</i>
<i>can't really trust you.</i>

211
00:23:00,908 --> 00:23:07,515
{\an4}<i>Naruto, I've watched you all</i>
<i>these years, seen all that</i>
<i>you've done. You should</i>
<i>already know.</i>

212
00:23:07,548 --> 00:23:12,385
{\an1}<i>It doesn't really matter</i>
<i>what you try to tell me, or</i>
<i>any Tailed Beast.</i>

213
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:16,122
{\an1}<i>Your true feelings won't</i>
<i>be transmitted to us.</i>

214
00:23:16,557 --> 00:23:20,360
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Kurama."</i>

215
00:23:20,828 --> 00:23:24,331
<i>In the end, it's</i>
<i>always the same...</i>
