{\an1}Nothing seems to work...

154
00:14:21,397 --> 00:14:24,198
(Obito)
It's hard to believe.

155
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:31,402
{\an1}So you're saying both your and
Sasuke's powers are necessary in
order to seal away this Kaguya?

156
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:35,872
{\an1}That's right!  But like I said
earlier, I can't sense Sasuke
now!

157
00:14:35,905 --> 00:14:38,439
{\an1}The ice is moving.

158
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:42,642
[explosion]

159
00:14:45,744 --> 00:14:48,144
I'm over there!

160
00:14:53,848 --> 00:14:55,615
[gasp]

161
00:15:15,826 --> 00:15:19,628
[grunt]

162
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:26,565
{\an1}[grunt] She's merged with
nature!

163
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:33,069
[scream]

164
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:36,071
(Sakura)
Naruto...!

165
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,774
{\an1}She's finally showing herself!

166
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:46,242
{\an1}What's happening now?

167
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:48,778
[gasp]

168
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:55,048
(Thinking)
That's a type of Time-Space.

169
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:57,448
[grunts]

170
00:15:57,481 --> 00:16:01,618
{\an1}Argh, damn it!  It's no good!

171
00:16:01,651 --> 00:16:05,453
(Thinking)
Okay, I've made it look
like I'm trapped...

172
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:08,722
{\an1}(Naruto Thinking)
I'll just wait until she gets
closer-then attack!

173
00:16:08,755 --> 00:16:12,757
{\an1}You said that you suddenly
stopped sensing Sasuke?

174
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,857
Yeah.

175
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:17,526
{\an1}I suspect that he was taken
to another dimension.

176
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,561
{\an1}She emerged from a different
Time-Space.

177
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:24,463
{\an1}It's similar to my
Visual Prowess.

178
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:26,464
Can you get in?

179
00:16:26,497 --> 00:16:33,868
{\an1}If I resonate my Kamui the next
time she connects and opens a
portal to another Time-Space,

180
00:16:33,902 --> 00:16:36,302
{\an1}I'm positive I can enter it.

181
00:16:37,104 --> 00:16:41,338
{\an1}If Sasuke is there, I can bring
him back to this dimension.

182
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:45,075
{\an1}All right! Then for now I'll go
and support the real me.

183
00:16:45,674 --> 00:16:46,575
But...

184
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:47,910
[gasp]

185
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:58,247
{\an1}I'll need an enormous amount of
chakra,  since it's not my
Time-Space.

186
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:01,650
{\an1}If my chakra runs out, I'm done.

187
00:17:01,683 --> 00:17:03,684
{\an1}Then I'll go with you...  I
mean, the real me isn't gonna
down that quickly.

188
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:07,686
I'm strong.

189
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,788
{\an1}Your Clone Chakra
won't be enough.

190
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,193
{\an1}Would it still be inadequate
with my 100 Healings Chakra?

191
00:17:18,225 --> 00:17:23,196
{\an1}That would give me the minimum.
You two, come with me.

192
00:17:23,228 --> 00:17:24,996
Okay.

193
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:30,733
{\an1}We don't know if Sasuke is in
that Time-Space.  But we'll
start by entering her lair.

194
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,968
{\an1}I promise to find Sasuke, and
get him to the real you.

195
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:41,205
{\an1}Obito.  I want to thank you for
helping me out.

196
00:17:41,237 --> 00:17:44,173
{\an1}I really mean it.

197
00:17:44,207 --> 00:17:46,407
{\an1}And for helping Sasuke.

198
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,744
{\an1}No, there's no need to
thank me. Just watch our foe.

199
00:17:56,412 --> 00:18:01,015
{\an1}So, no more masks, huh?

200
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:19,558
{\an1}I am... Kakashi's friend, your
father's subordinate, an Uchiha
just like Sasuke, and

201
00:18:21,127 --> 00:18:26,629
{\an1}A Hokage is the one who walks
ahead of everybody else,
enduring their own pain.

202
00:18:26,662 --> 00:18:32,199
{\an1}There's no shortcut to becoming
Hokage! And no ways out for
anyone who does!

203
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:37,201
{\an1}And the way he forges ahead...
draws others to him.

204
00:18:37,235 --> 00:18:40,036
{\an1}You want to reach out
when he stumbles.

205
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:48,841
(Obito)
I... I am your senior, who
shared the same dream as you.

206
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:54,444
{\an1}I'm not going to waste time on
speeches.  I'm almost out of
time.

207
00:18:54,477 --> 00:19:08,051
{\an1}But I just ask that you let me
walk in front of you and...

208
00:19:08,085 --> 00:19:10,153
...die for you.

209
00:19:29,395 --> 00:19:32,964
(Minato)
Sorry I'm late.  Have you
learned anything yet?

210
00:19:32,998 --> 00:19:36,366
{\an1}There's no one here.

211
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:39,368
{\an1}...Just... the lower half
of Madara's body.

212
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:45,838
{\an4}If we've found part of Madara's
body just lying about, then is
it safe for us to assume that
he's dead now?

213
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:48,606
{\an1}I have a bad feeling about this.

214
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:57,144
{\an1}Well, either way, it looks like
he managed to complete it, his
Infinite Tsukuyomi.

215
00:19:57,178 --> 00:20:00,113
{\an1}Though it doesn't seem to
affect us dead folk...

216
00:20:01,313 --> 00:20:05,082
{\an1}Lord Fourth, how'd things
go at your end?

217
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:10,185
{\an1}I tried to free some people by
chopping off a branch of that
tree that had wrapped around

218
00:20:10,218 --> 00:20:12,386
{\an1}them, keeping them
trapped in the jutsu.

219
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,754
{\an1}But they didn't awaken.
And instead...

220
00:20:14,787 --> 00:20:19,890
{\an1}...another branch just whipped
down and wrapped them right back
up again.

221
00:20:19,924 --> 00:20:23,692
{\an1}So it was the same for you...

222
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:27,394
{\an1}In order to confirm Madara's
status and learn what
happened...

223
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:32,197
{\an1}we should use his lower half to
revive him with the Reanimation
Jutsu.

224
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,463
{\an1}Then we'll make him talk.

225
00:20:34,497 --> 00:20:37,499
{\an1}But we need a living
sacrificial victim for that!

226
00:20:37,532 --> 00:20:39,500
{\an1}How can you still be so naïve?!

227
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:42,869
{\an1}There's just got to
be another way...

228
