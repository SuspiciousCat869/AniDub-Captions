00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:22,083
{\an1}It appears that Fate
has decided you and
I would fight again.

2
00:00:22,117 --> 00:00:25,321
{\an1}After the last
time, I owe you
one!

3
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:32,864
{\an1}My own puppet,
huh?

4
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:37,136
{\an1}However, I no
longer care for
that body anymore.

5
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:42,610
{\an4}Because at long last,
I'm finally a true doll
that will never, ever
rot away!

6
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:45,079
{\an1}What I always
longed to be.

7
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:47,616
{\an1}[gasp]

8
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:50,987
{\an1}Run away, Sai.

9
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,357
{\an1}Captain!
The Foundation
agent!

10
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,262
{\an1}He swallowed
the clay!

11
00:00:57,295 --> 00:00:58,697
{\an1}Huh?

12
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,935
{\an4}Using Lightning
Style can neutralize
Deidara's detonating
clay.

13
00:01:02,968 --> 00:01:04,937
{\an1}I still have
some chakra left.

14
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:10,244
{\an4}Ittan, surround the
injured with protective
rock. Kiri, focus on
getting them healed up.

15
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:31,003
{\an7}<i>Too late!</i>

16
00:01:31,037 --> 00:01:31,871
{\an7}Hearrrgh!

17
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:32,906
{\an7}<i>Now!</i>

{\an1}"Sai and Shin"

21
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:30,956
An explosion?!

22
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,629
But we must
reinforce. And
crush our enemy.

23
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:37,264
{\an1}Zaji! How's
it going?

24
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:41,803
{\an4}Good, I think.
I can still sense
their chakra.
Everyone's alive!

{\an1}[struggling]

26
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,917
{\an1}I can't believe
we survived that.

27
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,419
{\an1}Huh? Sai!

28
00:03:59,826 --> 00:04:02,030
{\an1}The Salamander, huh?

29
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:06,735
{\an4}He surrounded the
bomb with a defensive
puppet he'd hidden
underground.

30
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:10,339
{\an4}Because of that,
the blast didn't
have much force.
Hmph.

31
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:12,776
{\an1}He's just...
a bomb...

32
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:14,745
{\an1}...to you?

33
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:20,652
{\an4}Hmph! You got something to
whine about?! You're just
garbage! You're not good
enough to replace Sasuke!

34
00:04:20,686 --> 00:04:22,855
{\an1}Shut the
hell up
weakling!

35
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:27,561
{\an4}As long as his soul's
bound to this world,
he'll keep coming back
to life!

36
00:04:27,595 --> 00:04:30,765
{\an1}I can make him
into a bomb over
and over!

37
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:35,171
{\an1}[laughing]

38
00:04:35,204 --> 00:04:41,412
{\an1}But Shin...
My brother.

39
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:43,048
{\an1}I just...

40
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,585
{\an1}I really don't
want to have to
hurt you, Sai.

41
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,822
{\an1}I died...

42
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:52,526
{\an1}...and when I did
I was freed from
the foundation.

43
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,402
{\an4}I have heard rumors about the
Leaf's Foundation. You're
raised together from the time
you're young, like siblings.

44
00:04:59,435 --> 00:05:03,172
{\an1}And then forced to
fight and kill one
another in the end.

45
00:05:03,206 --> 00:05:06,310
{\an1}A training system
that destroys
emotions.

46
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:10,449
{\an1}Where there's no
feeling, there is
no doubt.

47
00:05:10,483 --> 00:05:13,787
{\an1}And that makes for
a truly powerful
shinobi.

48
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,891
{\an1}You of the Foundation
are just like me.

49
00:05:16,924 --> 00:05:20,662
{\an7}Don't call yourself
an artist just because
you can draw a little bit!

50
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:25,835
{\an1}True art is an explosion!
And I think it's time for
another big one!

51
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:29,239
{\an1}Just you try it!

52
00:05:38,986 --> 00:05:43,357
{\an1}There's a drawing
I want to show you,
Brother.

53
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,594
{\an1}Oh? Well, then,
let me see it!

54
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:50,067
{\an1}No, I can't; it's
not finished yet.

55
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,803
{\an1}I'll show you
when it's done.

Damn it!
How annoying!

59
00:06:06,687 --> 00:06:09,557
{\an4}I knew I should
have detonated
myself a long
time ago!

60
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:15,431
{\an4}It's tasteless to exhibit
one's ultimate art over
and over, but if I must!
Fine! Hmph!

don't have to worry about these
two anymore. I'll use my Puppet
Jutsu to keep them restrained.

00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:38,660
{\an1}Now go help
Sai's brother!

70
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:49,976
{\an7}I always knew... in the
Foundation, I was going
to have to face you in
battle one day.

71
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:54,982
{\an1}So let's settle now
what we couldn't
back then.

72
00:07:16,242 --> 00:07:19,646
{\an1}My kunai is
in the target.
I guess I win.

{\an4}I'll bet that mine
collided in mid-air
and was knocked off
course.

75
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:30,127
{\an4}Luck is a skill too,
you know. Well, it's
decided: you're on
meal duty today.

76
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,161
{\an1}Yeah.

00:07:38,938 --> 00:07:39,537
{\an1}Huh?

00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:46,814
{\an1}It's nothing.

00:07:46,848 --> 00:07:54,791
{\an1}Oh...
Okay, then.

Hey

85
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:09,710
{\an1}Huh?

86
00:08:09,743 --> 00:08:13,581
{\an1}Just how long has
it been since both
of us came here?

87
00:08:13,615 --> 00:08:14,983
{\an1}Dunno.
Why?

88
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:19,155
{\an4}Oh.  Well...
I was wondering
how long we're
going to stay.

89
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:24,896
{\an4}And I was thinking that you
and Lord Danzo are the only
people I ever see in this
place.

90
00:08:24,929 --> 00:08:28,500
{\an1}I'm starting to
lose track of
time here.

91
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:32,272
{\an1}Of course,
I don't really
care!

92
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:36,010
{\an1}That's because Shin,
I'd stay with you
forever if I could!

93
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:45,554
{\an1}Me, too.

94
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,569
{\an1}What is this?

95
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,539
{\an1}Go on,
open it!

96
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:08,251
{\an1}It's...

97
00:09:08,284 --> 00:09:10,387
{\an1}It's a sketchbook.

98
00:09:10,421 --> 00:09:11,989
{\an1}Yeah.

99
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:16,995
{\an4}I know you've wanted
one for a long time.
So I bougt  last time
I went into town.

100
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:19,464
{\an1}Thank you
so much!

101
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:26,773
{\an4}You know what...
I think I'm going
to draw pictures of
you and me in here.

102
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:28,376
{\an1}Huh?

103
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:32,848
{\an4}I'm gonna make this
into a picture book
that tells the story
of you and me.

104
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:37,188
{\an1}Sounds great.
And you'll show it to
me when it's finished?

105
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:40,558
{\an1}Seriously! I want you
to promise that you'll
show it to me, okay?

106
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:44,062
{\an1}Mhm.

107
00:09:49,436 --> 00:09:54,909
{\an7}Huh? Lord Danzo..
what did you say?!
Could you repeat that?

108
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:03,187
{\an4}The order I gave you is not
complicated in the slightest:
the two of you are going to
fight each other, to the death.

109
00:10:03,221 --> 00:10:05,089
{\an1}But that's...

110
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:14,934
{\an1}This is your final test
and your fate. You are
members of the Foundation.

111
00:10:14,968 --> 00:10:22,878
{\an4}After three days,
if you two are still alive
and you make any attempt to
descend from this mountain..

112
00:10:22,912 --> 00:10:28,118
{\an1}..Then the both of
you are going to be
killed. Understood?

00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:38,698
{\an1}No, this...
can't be.

00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:41,369
{\an1}I can't kill
my brother.

115
00:10:41,402 --> 00:10:42,804
{\an1}Then...

116
00:10:42,837 --> 00:10:45,040
{\an1}I'll just have
to kill you
instead!

into my illness.

{\an7}There's nothing
we can do. It's
completely incurable.

{\an1}No. That's...

135
00:11:51,424 --> 00:12:00,802
{\an4}Lord Danzo doesn't know anything
about this. So when you report
back to him just tell him that
you got rid of me.

136
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:02,838
{\an1}No! I can't.

137
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:10,114
{\an7}I knew all along
that the final test
of the Foundation
is to kill acomrade.

tell you that I was
sick before today.

00:12:17,924 --> 00:12:19,793
{\an1}I tried to live
with this secret.

141
00:12:19,826 --> 00:12:23,632
{\an1}So that I could
lose to you in

{\an4}Brother, I also knew
one day I was going
to have to battle
someone.

145
00:12:40,085 --> 00:12:43,524
{\an1}But never did I
imagine it was
going to be you!

146
00:12:43,557 --> 00:12:47,329
{\an1}[small chuckle]
So, you knew
all along.

147
00:12:47,362 --> 00:12:57,007
{\an4}Kill your emotions, Sai.
Because otherwise, your
duty is going to absolutely
destroy you.

148
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,275
{\an1}Now go.

149
00:12:58,308 --> 00:13:01,312
{\an1}Go and live life
for the both of
us.

150
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:03,949
{\an1}Brother.

151
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:09,457
{\an7}I'm still capable...
[struggling]
...of ending my own
life.

152
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,426
{\an1}[gasp]

153
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,365
{\an1}Go!
[heavy breathing]

154
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:19,602
{\an1}[small whimper]

155
00:13:19,636 --> 00:13:27,012
{\an4}Don't cry! Didn't
I tell you to kill
your emotions?!
[struggling]

156
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:29,080
{\an1}I understand.

157
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:34,921
{\an1}[struggling]

158
00:13:34,955 --> 00:13:40,963
{\an1}[wet coughing]

159
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:49,840
{\an7}But I really do
wish that I could
have seen your
finished drawing.

160
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,017
{\an1}You want to settle
our last match?

161
00:13:58,051 --> 00:14:00,621
{\an1}Hey, Sai.
You doin'
all right?

162
00:14:00,654 --> 00:14:06,762
{\an4}Sai, I see.
So that's what
your name is now,
is it?

163
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:19,578
{\an1}But you know.
It's not necessary.

164
00:14:19,612 --> 00:14:21,046
{\an1}[gasp]

165
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,416
{\an1}Brother.

166
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,320
{\an1}I'm really glad
that you finished
it.

167
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:33,329
{\an4}I finally got to see
the drawing that I
longed to see.
And it's as though...

168
00:14:33,363 --> 00:14:37,935
{\an1}Your drawing has
freed my soul from
all of its bindings.

169
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:42,575
{\an1}[gasp]

170
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:47,347
{\an4}Sai...
These comrades
who call you by
your name...

171
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:52,320
{\an1}Cherish them.

172
00:14:54,155 --> 00:14:59,195
{\an1}Thank you.

173
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:08,206
{\an1}What's going
on out there?

174
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,010
{\an7}<i>My threads just</i>
<i>went slack.</i>

175
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:16,451
{\an4}Sasori, Sakura once
explained to me all
about the way you
do battle.

176
00:15:22,658 --> 00:15:27,565
{\an7}<i>The girl who was</i>
<i>with Granny Chiyo</i>
<i>back then.</i>

177
00:15:27,598 --> 00:15:33,105
{\an1}Get over here!

178
00:15:33,138 --> 00:15:35,274
{\an1}[attack punch]

179
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:48,257
{\an1}[gasp]

180
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:53,230
{\an1}I forbade even
myself use of
this jutsu.

181
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:55,834
{\an1}I never imagined
I would use it
again.

182
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:59,873
{\an1}But against
you I must.

183
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:01,273
{\an1}[grunt]

184
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:04,812
{\an1}It's time that
we finish this,
here and now!

185
00:16:20,532 --> 00:16:22,234
{\an1}There's so
many of them!

186
00:16:25,171 --> 00:16:31,144
{\an4}It's said the ability of a
puppet master is measured
by the number of puppets
they can use.

187
00:16:31,178 --> 00:16:35,083
{\an1}I'd expect no
less from you,
Grandmother.

188
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:40,423
{\an1}Granny Chiyo's Secret
Multiple Digits. I've
heard tell of their glory...

189
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,828
{\an1}You once destroyed
an entire fortress
with it...

190
00:16:43,861 --> 00:16:47,432
{\an1}Secret White Move:
Chikamatsu's Ten Puppets.

191
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:52,740
{\an4}Ten Masterpieces.
All created by the
first Puppet Master
Monzaemon.

192
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:54,742
{\an1}An exquisite
collection.

193
00:16:57,211 --> 00:16:58,680
{\an1}However...

194
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:13,499
{\an1}I used these to
destroy an entire
nation.

195
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,834
{\an1}[gasp]

196
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:19,205
{\an1}Secret Red Move:
Performance of a
Hundred Puppets.

197
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:23,177
{\an1}The true source
of your power
lies in your soul.

198
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:28,818
{\an4}You tried to erase
your soul by becoming
a puppet, but you
didn't fully succeed.

199
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:35,760
{\an4}I can still feel it,
inside this puppet
that you made, where
your undying soul dwells.

200
00:17:35,794 --> 00:17:43,303
{\an4}You may inhabit living
flesh now, but that's
only a shell, nothing
more than a mere puppet.

201
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:46,708
{\an1}You were a first-rate
shinobi puppet master
at one time.

202
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:50,279
{\an4}Not just some
lowlife that allows
another person to
manipulate him.

203
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:56,988
{\an1}And if I'm not mistaken,
you were using Kabuto as
your spy back then.

204
00:17:57,021 --> 00:18:00,859
{\an1}But the tables have
turned now; he's the
one using you.

205
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:04,162
{\an4}A puppet master
controlled by
another is done
for.

206
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:10,404
{\an4}Whether it's you or whoever
might be controlling you,
there's no way that I'm
going to lose here.

207
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:18,180
{\an4}Because now I am
the ninja puppet
master of the <i>real</i>
Sasori puppet!

208
00:18:18,214 --> 00:18:22,987
{\an1}Your art, the puppets
that you've created,
will live on forever.

209
00:18:23,021 --> 00:18:29,161
{\an4}As long as future generations
of puppet masters still remain
to inherit the soul that resides
within them.

210
00:18:29,194 --> 00:18:31,865
{\an1}[chuckle]

211
00:18:31,898 --> 00:18:39,274
{\an1}So that is precisely
the true form of art
I sought.

212
00:18:39,307 --> 00:18:41,410
{\an1}Hey, quit messing
around, would ya?!

213
00:18:41,443 --> 00:18:47,484
{\an4}Don't listen, Sasori!
Don't pay any attention
to that jerk at all, do
you hear me?! Hmph!

214
00:18:47,518 --> 00:18:51,924
{\an4}Art is a solitary
flash of light!
True art is an
explosion!

215
00:18:51,957 --> 00:18:57,064
{\an1}You hear me,
Sasori?!

216
00:18:57,097 --> 00:19:02,603
{\an7}<i>The soul of the</i>
<i>creator dwells</i>
<i>within, huh?</i>
<i>You're right.</i>

217
00:19:02,637 --> 00:19:05,174
{\an1}Kankuro...

218
00:19:05,206 --> 00:19:06,876
{\an1}What is it?

219
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:15,821
{\an1}I entrust you with
the "Father" and
"Mother" puppets.

220
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:21,061
{\an4}When you pass, give
them to another, so
that they may live
forever, too.

221
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:22,763
{\an1}Because those
two are...

222
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:26,101
{\an1}Of course. Yes,
I understand.

223
00:19:26,134 --> 00:19:29,370
{\an1}[grunt]
Hey! Sasori!
No!

224
00:19:43,722 --> 00:19:48,028
{\an1}It was a sacrificial
victim. What's going
on here?

225
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:52,033
{\an4}We were told that no
one who's under the
Reanimation Jutsu
could be killed.

226
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:55,104
{\an1}Maybe Kabuto
released a jutsu?

227
00:19:55,138 --> 00:19:58,208
{\an1}(deidara)
Let me out of
here, you bastard!

228
00:19:58,242 --> 00:20:04,015
{\an1}No, it doesn't seem that way.
Sasori is gone but that loud
one is still here, clearly.

229
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:09,688
{\an4}All along we thought that
the Reanimation Jutsu had
been perfected, but it
seems to have a flaw.

230
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:15,263
{\an4}Apparently it isn't
quite so easy to
control someone's
emotions.

231
00:20:15,295 --> 00:20:16,697
{\an1}Looks like
it's over.

232
00:20:16,731 --> 00:20:19,201
{\an1}No.
It's just
starting...

233
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:21,137
{\an1}Sai, Omoi, Zaji!

234
00:20:21,171 --> 00:20:22,605
{\an1}Set up an ambush!

235
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,908
{\an1}Yes, sir!
Roger!
Yeah.

236
00:20:33,152 --> 00:20:35,087
{\an1}What is it?

237
00:20:35,121 --> 00:20:39,459
{\an1}Oh, It's
nothing
at all.

238
00:20:39,493 --> 00:20:49,973
{\an7}<i>The Reanimation Jutsu...</i>
<i>There are still so many</i>
<i>mysteries behind it. But I</i>
<i>think that I've figured it out.</i>

239
00:20:50,006 --> 00:20:59,618
{\an4}Madara, you head out to the
front line. I'll stay hidden
and concentrate on the jutsu
for now.

240
00:20:59,652 --> 00:21:02,589
{\an7}<i>This woman...</i>

241
00:21:02,622 --> 00:21:05,426
{\an7}<i>She got this close</i>
<i>to the hideout...</i>

242
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:12,635
{\an7}<i>And Kabuto was</i>
<i>aware of it. Did</i>
<i>he purposely lead</i>
<i>her here?</i>

243
00:21:12,668 --> 00:21:18,610
{\an7}<i>That snake Kabuto.</i>
<i>He's pitting me against</i>
<i>the Allied Shinobi Forces.</i>

244
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:24,483
{\an7}<i>[chuckle]</i>
<i>That will never happen.</i>
<i>I'm the one who will</i>
<i>use him.</i>

245
00:22:57,469 --> 00:23:05,778
{\an4}The Reanimation Jutsu. Prove
to me right now that it really
requires living bodies. And
tell me all its secrets.

246
00:23:05,811 --> 00:23:08,081
{\an1}And if I say no?

247
00:23:08,115 --> 00:23:16,292
{\an4}You will surely not reach what
you desire, and what you desire
will become something else. It
will be your life!

248
00:23:16,326 --> 00:23:21,098
{\an4}Next time on
Naruto Shippuden:
"Secrets of the
Reanimation Jutsu."

249
00:23:21,132 --> 00:23:25,637
{\an1}Very well,
I'll explain.
