00:00:25,057 --> 00:00:26,118
-I see.

3
00:00:26,128 --> 00:00:27,059
Then let's move.

4
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:35,198
-Hm?

5
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,039
-Huh?

6
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:55,099
-Huh?

7
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:56,271
Bandits!

8
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:02,307
-You shouldn't be
out here, old timers.

9
00:01:02,317 --> 00:01:05,190
Didn't you get the emergency
bulletin from the Land of Fire

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,293
about the temporary curfew?

11
00:01:07,303 --> 00:01:10,166
-Yes, but well, we
thought we might

12
00:01:10,176 --> 00:01:12,318
be of some use in
the fighting ahead.

13
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:14,260
-Yeah, you won't
see us two getting

14
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,244
into whippersnappers
on our land.

15
00:01:18,254 --> 00:01:21,087
-Hmph.

16
00:01:21,097 --> 00:01:23,120
-That was scary.

17
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,182
-Yeah.

-Milady, I have an update.

20
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:20,496
We've sent 20 platoons to form
a perimeter around the Fire

21
00:03:20,506 --> 00:03:22,498
Temple with a 150
kilometer radius.

22
00:03:26,323 --> 00:03:30,477
Even an ant couldn't
get past us.

23
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:32,439
-Excuse me, ma'am.

24
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:34,511
We have received a report
from third platoon.

25
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:37,334
Border areas C and E are clear.

26
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,487
No sign of the Akatsuki.

27
00:03:39,497 --> 00:03:42,240
-Then where are they?

28
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,481
-New report has come in.

29
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:47,255
Areas F and G, all clear, ma'am.

30
00:03:47,265 --> 00:03:49,478
We still haven't
found the Akatsuki.

31
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:52,431
-I can see that.

32
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,324
Why can't we find them?

33
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:58,257
Have we heard from Team
Asuma at the Fire Temple?

34
00:03:58,267 --> 00:03:59,268
-No, Milady.

35
00:03:59,278 --> 00:04:00,379
Nothing reported yet.

-What's this all about?

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,533
-You've come from the
Leaf Village, correct?

40
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:33,385
-Yes.

41
00:04:33,395 --> 00:04:34,486
-I see.

42
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:38,310
We were contacted by the monk
who has been in your care.

43
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,381
-Greetings to you all.

44
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:42,495
I am the head monk in
charge of the Fire Temple.

45
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:45,498
I had been away from the
temple for quite some time.

46
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:47,580
But when I heard
what had happened,

47
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,394
I rushed back as
quickly as I could.

48
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:53,396
It was a terrible sight indeed.

49
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:06,611
We asked neighboring temples
for help recovering the remains.

50
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:13,438
-This is awful.

51
00:05:13,448 --> 00:05:14,529
-Excuse me, sir.

52
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:15,430
Where's Chiriku?

53
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:21,527
-Well, actually, we've been unable
to find Lord Chiriku's remains.

54
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,463
IZUMO: Um, Captain Asuma.

55
00:05:27,473 --> 00:05:30,577
Well, sir, as much as I
hate to bring this up,

56
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:34,471
Chiriku does still have a 30
million ryo bounty on his head

57
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:35,642
on the black market.

58
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:37,594
-30 million ryo?

59
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,436
That's quite a large bounty.

60
00:05:39,446 --> 00:05:44,472
If the Akatsuki knew,
they'd try to collect.

61
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:47,485
So that means the enemy
is carrying his body along

62
00:05:47,495 --> 00:05:49,427
with them.

63
00:05:49,437 --> 00:05:52,480
-Izumo, where are the
collection offices?

64
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,383
-Including the
one closest to us,

65
00:05:55,393 --> 00:05:56,665
there are five
locations in total.

66
00:06:02,551 --> 00:06:05,524
Now the other teams can head
to the exchange points closest

67
00:06:05,534 --> 00:06:06,655
to them.

68
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:08,588
-All right, let's hurry.

69
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:12,492
-Please wait a moment,
Lord Asuma Sarutobi.

70
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:13,613
-Hm?

71
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,656
-For those of you who are
about to enter a fight,

72
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,449
allow me a moment to
offer you a prayer.

73
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:22,442
Please.

74
00:06:25,446 --> 00:06:26,487
-It would be an honor.

I wish we could
have shared just one

82
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:39,746
more of our all-night talks.

83
00:07:39,756 --> 00:07:44,561
There were still so many things
I wanted to talk to you about.

-Please be safe on your journey.

00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,784
-We cannot thank you enough.

87
00:08:05,794 --> 00:08:09,618
And sir, we'll do our
best to find Chiriku.

too far in your quest.

As a former member of the
Guardian Shinobi Twelve,

90
00:08:17,827 --> 00:08:22,712
you have a bounty on your
head, just like Chiriku.

Please be careful.

92

-Well thank you, but you have
no need to worry about me, sir.

93
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,771
You know the bounty on my head?

It's 5 million more
than his for a reason.

-Hmph.

96
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,603
Yeah, the only thing to
worry about with Asuma

97
00:08:41,613 --> 00:08:42,784
is that he smokes too much.

with the training?

Let me guess, you came to
check in on Naruto like I did.

-No, I was just
taking a brisk walk

to make sure I didn't get out
of shape because of my injury.

I take that back.

Actually, you were
absolutely right.

-Mhm, see, it's
good to be honest.

108

-Naruto's training,
was it postponed?

109
00:09:37,713 --> 00:09:39,865
-Well, he probably went
off somewhere to refocus.

110
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,859
His body and mind can't keep
up such intense training

without taking a
break now and then.

Keep going.

116

We're almost there.

117
00:09:54,842 --> 00:09:56,804
-Hey, I've got an idea.

118
00:09:56,814 --> 00:09:59,807
While we're here, why don't you
give one of these babies a try?

119
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:01,789
-What is that?

120
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,780
A mudball?

121
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,891
-Don't be rude.

122
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:04,902
No.

123
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:06,714
This is one of my
homemade food pills.

124
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:09,918
It's super special.

125
00:10:09,928 --> 00:10:11,810
-Special, huh?

126
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,813
-You know, I suppose it's more
like medicine than a food pill.

127
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,726
It's chock full of all kinds
of nutritious goodness mixed

128
00:10:17,736 --> 00:10:19,819
with a bunch of fast-acting
digestive agents.

129
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:21,781
All of which were
hand-picked by yours truly

130
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,874
and rolled up into a convenient
ball packed with energy.

131
00:10:24,884 --> 00:10:26,896
In fact, in addition
to helping you recover,

132
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:28,938
I'd venture to say
the pill might even

133
00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:32,702
add some healthy color to that
pale, sickly skin of yours.

134
00:10:32,712 --> 00:10:34,795
They say the best
medicine is always bitter.

135
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:36,917
So the food pills might
taste a little strange.

136
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,700
But when you consider the
benefits of taking them,

137
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,904
tiny details like flavor
will be of no-- hm?

138
00:10:43,915 --> 00:10:46,748
Sai?

139
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:47,879
Hm?

140
00:10:52,894 --> 00:10:55,727
-I feel dizzy.

141
00:10:55,737 --> 00:10:59,762
That stuff tastes and smells so
bad, there's no way it'll work.

142
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:03,856
In fact, it's making me sick.

143
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:05,888
NARUTO: Pork ramen.

144
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:06,899
-See, Naruto?

145
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:08,871
We're here.

146
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:09,893
Hello?

147
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:10,974
-Welcome, customers!

148
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:18,892
-Uh, hi.

00:11:18,902 --> 00:11:20,884
-Listen, old man.

00:11:20,894 --> 00:11:23,027
Extra large pork
miso with extra pork.

151

On the double.

152
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:25,870
WAITRESS: We have a new menu.

153
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,852
Take a look.

154
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:28,933
-That's great.

155
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:32,016
But I still want an extra
large pork miso with meat,

156
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:33,788
noodles al dente.

157

-Hey, come on.

158
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:36,021
You didn't even
look at the menu.

159
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:38,003
-Give it a look see, Naruto.

160
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:40,796
As of today, we've made
some pretty big changes

161
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:41,887
to the lineup.

162
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:42,858
-That's right.

163
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,979
We serve dipping noodles.

164
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:45,941
-Oh, wow.

165
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:48,925
I'm sticking with extra
large pork miso with meat.

166
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:51,858
And go ahead and throw in
some pickled red ginger.

167
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:52,849
-Would you listen?

168
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:54,811
We don't serve ramen
here any longer.

169
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:55,622
-Huh?

170
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,891
-Wait a second.

171
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:06,834
So this is a dipping
noodle shop now?

172
00:12:06,844 --> 00:12:08,876
-See, my daughter
Ayame went off to get

173
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:10,988
some professional training
as a noodle maker.

174
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:13,001
She came home and said,
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) dad,

175
00:12:13,011 --> 00:12:14,943
the age of dipping
noodles has arrived.

176
00:12:14,953 --> 00:12:18,867
We need to take Ichiraku in
a new culinary direction.

177
00:12:18,877 --> 00:12:19,978
Yep.

178
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:22,941
Now my girl's got all kinds
of fancy business knowledge.

179
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,833
-The customers'
likes and dislikes

180
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:25,945
are constantly evolving.

181
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:29,028
If Ichiraku doesn't change too,
we'll fall behind the times.

182
00:12:29,038 --> 00:12:29,929
-See?

183
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:30,930
Ha ha.

184
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,952
-What the hell are
you talking about?

185
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:37,016
All I wanted was a simple
pork miso and meat.

186
00:12:37,027 --> 00:12:38,088
-It'll be fine.

187
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:40,931
Dipping noodles are pretty
much the same as ramen.

188
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:42,012
-No they're not.

189
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:44,955
Dipping noodles are served
separate from the broth.

190
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,066
You dip and eat, like soba.

191
00:12:46,076 --> 00:12:48,939
-Well, it all goes
to the same place.

192
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:50,962
-The concept is
totally different.

193
00:12:50,972 --> 00:12:52,854
-He's absolutely right.

194
00:12:52,864 --> 00:12:54,936
Ramen's not the same
as dipping noodles.

195
00:12:54,946 --> 00:12:57,098
And I really want ramen,
so let's get it going, huh?

196
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:59,020
-We've only prepared
dipping noodles.

197
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,071
So I'm sorry.

198
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:01,122
-Oh, come on.

199
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:02,944
Switching back to
ramen would just

200
00:13:02,954 --> 00:13:04,897
be tweaking the soup
a little, right?

201
00:13:04,907 --> 00:13:06,999
-You'd be satisfied with
phony ramen like that?

202
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:09,011
I thought you of all
people would have standards

203
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,103
for quality pork
miso and meat ramen.

204
00:13:11,113 --> 00:13:13,055
-No, it's not like that.

205
00:13:13,065 --> 00:13:13,956

This food talk
makes me so hungry.

208
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:24,868
I-- I don't care anymore.

209
00:13:24,878 --> 00:13:26,149
We'll take the dipping noodles.

210
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,122
-Three orders of
dipping noodles.

211
00:13:28,132 --> 00:13:30,154
-Right, three orders coming up.

212
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:35,079
Here you go.

213
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:36,090
Fresh out of the pot.

214
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,021
-All right.

215
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:37,922
Finally.

216
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:39,964
AYAME: Just a minute.

217
00:13:39,974 --> 00:13:41,076
-Huh?

218
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,999
-The noodles are
a tad undercooked.

219
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:46,001
They need to boil
for one more minute.

220
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:46,982
-They do?

221
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,173
-And check the
water temperature.

222
00:13:48,183 --> 00:13:49,925
-OK.

223
00:13:49,935 --> 00:13:51,947
-Wait, you're going to
make them over again?

224
00:13:55,992 --> 00:13:56,933
-Orders up.

-All right. Huh?

227

Where's the soup?

228
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:04,020
-It's a bit too strong.

229
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,953
The product in Yugao
Village was slightly more

230
00:14:06,964 --> 00:14:08,075
on the refreshing side.

231
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:09,967
Start it over again.

232
00:14:09,977 --> 00:14:10,918
-Right away.

00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:11,989
-Hey.

-In that first bite,
we must make our mark

on the customer with perfection.

00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:18,045
-That's the spirit, Ayame.

237
00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:20,078
Show me the results
of your training.

-Oh, so hungry.

-Here you go.

240
00:14:24,192 --> 00:14:26,204
Ichiraku's very own
dipping noodles.

241
00:14:26,214 --> 00:14:30,048
And this time, it's perfect.

242
00:14:30,058 --> 00:14:32,942
-Well, it's about time.

243

Old man, can I get some pork
slices, and pickled bamboo

fish cake toppings?

-Ha ha!

250
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:51,001
If I eat it like
this, it's ramen.

251
00:14:51,011 --> 00:14:52,092
-That's quality dipping noodles.

252
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:54,024
You can't do that.

253
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:55,236
-No, Ayame.

254
00:14:55,246 --> 00:14:58,159
Somehow you have forgotten the
most basic guiding principle

255
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:00,201
for a restaurateur.

256
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:03,104
You're getting caught
up in the small details.

257
00:15:03,114 --> 00:15:06,057
But what's most important is
that the customer is satisfied,

258
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:07,058
right?

259
00:15:07,068 --> 00:15:08,990
-That's why I put
my heart and soul

260
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,212
into making these
dipping noodles.

261
00:15:10,222 --> 00:15:12,064
It's the restaurant's
responsibility

262
00:15:12,074 --> 00:15:16,218
to advise the customer, to
act as their culinary guide,

263
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:19,211
making sure they experience
only the finest of ingredients

264
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:21,073
and modern methods
of preparation.

265
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,057
-But I want to eat ramen,
and you won't let me!

-Save your yelling for after
you've sampled our noodles!

You'll see.

268

And you'll never selfishly
ask for ramen again!

That was delicious.

noodles are lighter than ramen.

271

I think I actually
might prefer it.

really stiff when

274

00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:48,083
I know, I'll hire some energetic
youngster to work part-time.

-Ah, at the end of
the day, anything

tastes delicious when
you're hungry enough.

though he complained about it,

281

he drank every drop of that
heavy dipping noodle soup.

282

-I may not agree with
how he ate our cuisine.

But he did wolf
down three bowls,

-Ah great.

it comes to mutual respect.

Besides, you're

325
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:41,225
We're only late because we
have to stop at that collection

326
00:17:41,235 --> 00:17:42,416
office or whatever it is.

327
00:17:42,426 --> 00:17:46,180
For crying out loud, you're make
this tedious trip even longer.

328
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,282
I'm telling you, it's
getting really annoying.

329
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:52,337
Huh?

330
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:54,239
-This is annoying?

331
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:58,163
This is part of an
important mission.

332
00:17:58,173 --> 00:17:59,184
-Whatever.

333
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:00,365
I know you're in
charge of making money

334
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,187
for the Organization.

335
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:03,348
But this bounty?

336
00:18:03,358 --> 00:18:06,462
It's a pittance, barely
enough to cover the after

337
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:08,294
party for a tailed beast hunt.

338
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:14,471
Huh?

339
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:18,285
Hey, wait up.

340
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:19,406
I'm sorry.

341
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,458
That body must be
pretty heavy, right?

342
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:25,402
I don't mind
carrying it for you.

343
00:18:25,412 --> 00:18:29,336
-And what do you plan to
do with my valuable bounty?

344
00:18:29,346 --> 00:18:30,378
-What?

345
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:33,361
Hey, I was only trying
to be nice here.

346
00:18:33,371 --> 00:18:35,353
-You want to discard it.

347
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:37,255
-What are you talking about?

348
00:18:37,265 --> 00:18:39,237
-Don't play dumb.

349
00:18:39,247 --> 00:18:40,308
I can see through you.

350
00:18:40,318 --> 00:18:44,233
You would rather get rid
of this body, wouldn't you?

351
00:18:44,243 --> 00:18:46,365
-All right, you got me.

352
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,367
Let's forget that guy and
get to the Jinchuriki.

353
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:54,343
See that?

354
00:18:54,353 --> 00:18:57,347
I finally made you mad.

355
00:18:57,357 --> 00:18:58,368
-You damn bastard.

356
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,356
-Hey, come on.

357
00:19:06,366 --> 00:19:07,237
What?

358
00:19:07,237 --> 00:19:08,339
No fight then?

359
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:12,343
-I don't have time to spend on
your pointless distractions.

360
00:19:12,353 --> 00:19:16,327
And besides, after
this mission, I'll

361
00:19:16,337 --> 00:19:18,259
be sending you to
the next world,

362
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:22,324
so I won't have to listen
to you in this one anymore.

363
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:24,546
-Ah, not that again.

364
00:19:25,257 --> 00:19:28,370
Man, I sure hope whoever
our next opponent

365
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,272
is, they have
enough fight in them

366
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:31,463
so I can finally
let off some steam.

367
00:19:43,456 --> 00:19:47,451
-Well, sensei, what was this
thing you had to show me?

368
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:49,493
-This is what I
wanted to show you.

369
00:19:49,503 --> 00:19:51,445
It's very cool.

370
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:52,346
Watch this.

371
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:09,314
-Wait, is that-- Ra-- Rasengan?

372
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:18,394
Kakashi-sensei, you
can use Rasengan too?

373
00:20:18,404 --> 00:20:19,726
-Hmph.

374
00:20:26,343 --> 00:20:28,365
[theme music]

375
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,522
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I can't believe

376
00:21:58,532 --> 00:21:59,713
the Rasengan is an
incomplete jutsu.

377
00:22:00,424 --> 00:22:02,476
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Adding
a change in chakra nature

378
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:04,459
to the Rasengan
is something even

379
00:22:04,469 --> 00:22:06,481
the Fourth Hokage
couldn't accomplish.

380
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,584
In other words, whatever
comes next, I can't teach you.

381
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,486
You'll have to discover
it for yourself.

382
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,597
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): No way.

383
00:22:12,607 --> 00:22:14,439
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Naruto, do you

384
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:15,701
understand why I'm
telling you this?

385
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:16,732
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Why?

386
00:22:16,732 --> 00:22:18,444
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
It's because I believe

387
00:22:18,444 --> 00:22:20,446
that you are the
only shinobi who

388
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:22,518
can surpass the Fourth Hokage.

389
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:25,505
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time-- The Next Step.
