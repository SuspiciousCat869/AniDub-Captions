{\an1}Yes, of course! I'm sure
that you'll get it!

{\an1}What is going on here?!

151
00:15:11,273 --> 00:15:13,074
{\an1}There is no end to this!

156
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,892
{\an1}Huh! Pervy Sage,
what happened?

157
00:15:53,127 --> 00:15:55,494
{\an1}Oh! So you're back now, huh?

158
00:15:55,894 --> 00:16:00,130
{\an1}But, how did you get hurt!?

159
00:16:00,163 --> 00:16:05,432
{\an1}Don't worry, it's nothing. But
I can't move much, so I've
gotta head back for now.

160
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:10,068
{\an1}But you'd better get back to
the others you got that?

161
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,235
{\an1}See ya. Reverse
Summoning Jutsu!

162
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,207
Huh... Argh!

[gasp]

165
00:16:42,817 --> 00:16:45,052
{\an1}Not good. At this rate,
they're all going to be...

166
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:45,852
Hold on...

167
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:47,086
What? Why?

168
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,687
{\an1}The way things are going, the
Leaf shinobi are in real danger.

169
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,056
{\an1}Just wait. I sense massive
chakra closing in...

170
00:17:00,126 --> 00:17:03,761
{\an1}Why did this fight have to
turn into such a drag?

171
00:17:03,794 --> 00:17:06,495
{\an1}Aw, man, I am such an idiot!

because that jutsu is-

{\an1}Damn you to hell!  How dare you
ruin my masterpieces like this!

193
00:19:00,316 --> 00:19:02,818
{\an1}Are you the Puppet
User behind this?

194
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:06,120
Heh.

195
00:19:12,656 --> 00:19:14,456
Ah!

196
00:19:17,058 --> 00:19:20,326
Huh...? Damnit!

197
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:26,230
{\an1}Uh... Sorry, guys,
but he got away...

198
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:28,964
{\an1}That was amazing!

199
00:19:28,997 --> 00:19:32,833
{\an1}Taking down all of those puppets
by yourself.  Just incredible.

200
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:37,101
{\an1}I believe that I just might
have been underestimating
you all this time!

201
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:40,203
{\an1}That's for sure!  You were
hiding amazing power!

202
00:19:40,236 --> 00:19:42,871
{\an1}That power must
be acknowledged.

203
00:19:42,904 --> 00:19:46,072
{\an1}The reason is because everyone
had a tough time with the enemy

204
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:48,573
{\an1}but you came and took
them down by yourself.

205
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:51,142
{\an1}Yeah! I'd expect
nothing less!

206
00:19:51,175 --> 00:19:53,109
Well, I was
totally surprised!

207
00:19:53,143 --> 00:19:56,476
{\an1}They say that skilled
hawks hide their talons
until they need them!

208
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:00,378
{\an1}I really hate to admit it, but
this is one time that I have
to acknowledge him.

209

[bark bark]

210

{\an1}Tsk...

211
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:06,949
{\an1}By the way, Naruto, we're going
to go and save our friends.

212
00:20:06,982 --> 00:20:12,052
{\an1}It'll mean disobeying the rules
of the Leaf Village, but it's
what all of us wanna do.

213
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:16,221
{\an1}All right, that's great!  And I
feel the same way as you guys
do, of course!

214
00:20:16,254 --> 00:20:18,821
Well, Sasuke?

215
00:20:18,855 --> 00:20:23,590
{\an4}With this much fighting
strength, you can't tell us that
rescuing our friends is
impossible anymore.

216
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:27,892
Sasuke! come along
with us, ya know!

217
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:30,093
{\an1}Fine, whatever.

218
00:20:30,126 --> 00:20:32,361
Okay then!
it's decided!

219
00:20:32,394 --> 00:20:35,863
{\an1}Alright, you all heard it!
We're working together now!

{\an1}Has your so-called test
finally produced a result now?

223
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:04,443
{\an1}I believe it's been proven
conclusively that they consider
the bonds of friendship more

224
00:21:04,476 --> 00:21:09,880
{\an1}important than the
rules of the village.

225
00:21:09,913 --> 00:21:13,848
{\an1}So there's no need
to continue anymore...
