-In order to be more quickly
understood by others,

28
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:04,417
one must first draw them in
and warm them to oneself.

29
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:06,721
For example, when
addressing others,

30
00:04:06,754 --> 00:04:09,259
if you persist in
maintaining formality,

31
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:11,495
a reserved air develops
and never allows

32
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:14,200
the gap to be bridged.

33
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:15,434
Have confidence.

34
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:18,473
Just take the plunge and
call out to people casually.

35
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:20,276
Or you could come
up with a nickname

36
00:04:20,309 --> 00:04:22,312
or a term of endearment.

37
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,617
By doing so, those you speak
to will feel closer to you

38
00:04:25,651 --> 00:04:28,589
and begin to see you
as more of a friend.

39
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:29,323
That make sense.

40
00:04:33,897 --> 00:04:36,200
-Ah, here it is.

41
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,469
-Hmm?

42
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,308
(TO HERSELF): What's
Sai doing here?

43
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:42,377
-For more information
consult Make-Out Paradise--

44
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:43,846
-Looking for an art
book or something?

45
00:04:43,846 --> 00:04:45,816
-Huh?

46
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:48,320
Miss Sakura.

47
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,655
-Hmph.

48
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:53,227
I never pegged you as a reader.

49
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:55,331
-Well, I guess I am.

50
00:04:59,204 --> 00:05:00,238
-(TO HERSELF): Hmph.

51
00:05:00,272 --> 00:05:04,244
So Sai does have a
human side, after all.

52
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:06,449
Naruto and I were on our
way to visit Kakashi-sensei

53
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:08,251
in the same hospital.

54
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:11,357
If you're free, you wanna come?

55
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,593
-Kakashi-sensei?

56
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:16,263
-Well, I mean, you are
part Team Kakashi now.

57
00:05:16,297 --> 00:05:17,866
Don't you think you
should meet the leader?

58
00:05:33,324 --> 00:05:34,926
-I don't care what happens.

59
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,199
Only one thing matters, and
that's getting my revenge.

60
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:42,471
So long as I get that
nothing else in this world

61
00:05:42,471 --> 00:05:42,906
is important.

62
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:50,184
However, if I can
obtain the power

63
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:54,724
to defeat Itachi by giving
myself to Orochimari,

64
00:05:54,757 --> 00:05:58,363
I'll give him my life
a thousand times over.

65
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:04,540
I can see everything.

66
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:08,612
So this is where all
that power's coming from.

67
00:06:08,612 --> 00:06:10,182
Interesting.

68
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:13,487
I never would have guessed
you had this inside of you.

69
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,889

--[gasping] Why did
I have that dream?

73
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:23,952
-Naruto!

74
00:06:26,842 --> 00:06:27,776
-What?

75
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:29,378
Aw, what's the deal?

76
00:06:29,412 --> 00:06:31,482
Why'd you bring Sai with you.

77
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:33,919
--[chuckling] I bumped
into him at the library.

78
00:06:33,953 --> 00:06:34,920
-Aw, man!

79
00:06:34,954 --> 00:06:36,891
I spent all this
time working it out

80
00:06:36,924 --> 00:06:38,927
so it would just be the
two of us alone together.

81
00:06:38,927 --> 00:06:40,263
You know, like a date.

82
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:41,931
-If you've got time to
daydream about that,

83
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:44,369
you should be studying ninjutsu.

84
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:46,272
-Yeah, like I'd study.

85
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:49,878
I can't believe you two hang
out in that stuffy old library.

86
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:53,383
-Naruto, you can't just
train your body all the time.

87
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,520
Your mind needs to get
some exercise, too.

88
00:06:55,553 --> 00:06:56,388
Ugh.

89
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:58,358
Sometimes you're such a dummy.

90
00:06:58,391 --> 00:06:59,793
-(TO HIMSELF): I knew it.

91
00:06:59,793 --> 00:07:02,664
Sakura is calling
Naruto by a nickname.

92
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:04,267
-So harsh.

93
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,704
Man, you really got me there.

94
00:07:06,738 --> 00:07:08,941
-Na-- Naruto?

95
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:10,277
Sa-- Sakura?

96
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:16,786
Do you do you mind if I
join your conversation?

97
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:19,224
-Hmm?

98
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:21,894
-Well, I read in
a book about how

99
00:07:21,928 --> 00:07:24,465
to make others feel
at ease around you.

100
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:26,802
The book said to call
out to people casually

101
00:07:26,802 --> 00:07:29,640
or to use nicknames and
terms of endearment.

102
00:07:29,674 --> 00:07:32,277
It said doing that
would breed familiarity

103
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:36,551
and might even
lead to friendship.

104
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:37,752
-Hey.

105
00:07:37,786 --> 00:07:38,854
Gee, Sai.

106
00:07:38,888 --> 00:07:40,791
I never knew you thought
about stuff like that.

107
00:07:40,824 --> 00:07:44,563
-So that's what you were
doing at the library.

108
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:45,899
-Mmm.

109
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,437
I've been trying to come up
with some nicknames for the two

110
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,377
of you, but I just couldn't
really think of any.

111
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,881
So I'll try to be more casual.

112
00:07:55,915 --> 00:07:57,317
-(TO HERSELF): Wow.

113
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,889
I can't believe Sai cares so
much about our friendship.

114
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:04,495
-Listen, you don't need to
put so much thought into it.

115
00:08:04,528 --> 00:08:06,431
Just let that stuff
come naturally.

116
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:08,434
-A lot of times, a
nickname or pet name

117
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:10,838
will refer to someone's
personality traits.

118
00:08:10,871 --> 00:08:13,309
Let's take Naruto for example.

119
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:14,578
-Hmm?

120
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:17,382
-You could go with Dimwit,
Bird Brain, or Stupid Naruto.

121
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:18,517
-Enough, Sakura.

122
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,020
Come on, you're killing me here.

123
00:08:23,392 --> 00:08:24,726
-(TO HIMSELF): I see.

124
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,366
Personality traits.

125
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,301
-Hmm.

126
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:30,703
(TO HERSELF) This is Sai?

127
00:08:30,736 --> 00:08:33,675
He's so different from
when we first met him.

128
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:40,484
-Uh, Sai?

129
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:43,756
Why are you staring
at me like that?

130
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,358
-Ah!

131
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,998
I understand.

132
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:51,736
Thanks for the advice, Ugly.

133
00:08:57,311 --> 00:08:58,046
NARUTO: Aw, boy.

134
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,448
SAKURA: Let me at him!

135
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:00,316
NARUTO: You might have crossed
the line with that one.

136
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,451
SAKURA: Who you calling ugly?

137
00:09:01,484 --> 00:09:02,052
Why you little--

138
00:09:02,286 --> 00:09:02,920
SAI: What do you mean?

139
00:09:02,953 --> 00:09:03,521
NARUTO: Aah!

140
00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:03,978
SAI: Nngh.

141
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:04,723
Sakura!

142
00:09:04,756 --> 00:09:06,592
NARUTO: Why'd you hit me, too?

143
00:09:09,364 --> 00:09:12,802
-So, you're the new team member.

144
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:14,605
Sai, was it?

145
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:16,508
Nice to meet you.

146
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:16,990
-Sir.

147
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:22,417
-Hey, Sakura.

148
00:09:22,451 --> 00:09:23,786
Come here a second.

149
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:26,057
-Hmm?

150
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,860
-Those two seem hurt.

151
00:09:27,893 --> 00:09:30,330
Did they fight or something?

152
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:32,333
Knowing Naruto's
temper, I can imagine

153
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:33,735
what must have gone down.

154
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:36,473
--[gasping] No, it's
nothing like that.

155
00:09:36,473 --> 00:09:37,808
We're all getting
along just dandy.

156
00:09:37,841 --> 00:09:38,943
-Oh.

157
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:40,312
OK.

158
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,882
Well, if you say so.

159
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,384
[nervous laughing]

160
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:48,759
-(TO HIMSELF): So this
is Kakashi Hatake.

161
00:09:48,793 --> 00:09:50,695
Legendary even to those
in the foundation.

162
00:09:54,868 --> 00:09:55,469
-Naruto?

163
00:09:55,502 --> 00:09:57,105
-Hmm.

164
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:00,377
Kakashi-sensei, on
our last mission, we--

165
00:10:00,377 --> 00:10:01,045
-I know.

166
00:10:01,045 --> 00:10:03,715
Yamato told me everything.

167
00:10:03,749 --> 00:10:04,984
About Sasuke, too.

168
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:12,095
-We're running out of
time to get him home.

169
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:16,001
At this rate, we-- we
could lose him for good.

170
00:10:16,035 --> 00:10:18,339
But with my power
there's just no way.

171
00:10:18,372 --> 00:10:20,776
I wouldn't be able to
bring him back now.

172
00:10:20,776 --> 00:10:23,714
Sasuke has gotten way
too strong for me.

173
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:25,750
-Well, in that
case, I guess you're

174
00:10:25,784 --> 00:10:28,521
gonna need to get even
stronger than that.

175
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:30,357
[gasps]

176
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:34,931
-Yeah, but, the way he's grown--
Sasuke has developed so fast.

177
00:10:34,965 --> 00:10:36,434
His growth isn't natural.

178
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:38,437
I spoke with Lady Tsunade.

179
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,375
She thinks they might be
using forbidden jutsu or even

180
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,911
drug enhancement.

181
00:10:42,911 --> 00:10:46,583
After all, they do
have Kabuto with them.

182
00:10:46,617 --> 00:10:48,987
No book in the world could
explain the kind of person

183
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,791
who performs experiments
on human beings.

184
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:53,761
-Which is why the
only thing we can do

185
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:56,733
was accelerate our own growth.

186
00:10:56,766 --> 00:10:59,403
-But how can we do that?

187
00:10:59,403 --> 00:11:01,072
-Do you think I've
just been lying here,

188
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:03,442
doing nothing the whole time?

189
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:07,950
I've been brainstorming
and I have an idea.

190
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,886
[gasps]

191
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,792
-However, what I came up with
is more suited to Naruto.

192
00:11:13,825 --> 00:11:15,395
-Huh?

193
00:11:15,395 --> 00:11:17,464
-Or rather, I should
say it's something

194
00:11:17,498 --> 00:11:20,970
that will only work with Naruto.

195
00:11:21,003 --> 00:11:24,910
In fact, if this
training pans out Naruto,

196
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:27,080
your power may
even surpass mine.

197
00:11:32,455 --> 00:11:33,724
-Hold on.

198
00:11:33,757 --> 00:11:36,595
I'd surpass you, Kakashi-sensei?

199
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:37,096
-That's right.

200
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:43,038
I'll be working with you
one on one the whole time

201
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:44,841
and it'll be training
like you've never

202
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:47,011
experienced before.

203
00:11:47,044 --> 00:11:48,614
-Um.

204
00:11:48,647 --> 00:11:50,851
What're we gonna be working on?

205
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:54,055
-We're going to create an
ultimate ninjutsu just for you.

206
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:55,558
[gasps]

207
00:11:55,591 --> 00:12:00,032
-A brand new jutsu, even more
powerful than the Rasengan.

208
00:12:00,065 --> 00:12:02,602
But in order to obtain
that kind of power,

209
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:05,040
you'll have to put in an
enormous amount of time

210
00:12:05,073 --> 00:12:06,542
and intense effort.

211
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:12,051
You can't get that kind of
strength in a couple days

212
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:14,988
like the hero of
some pulp novel.

213
00:12:15,022 --> 00:12:17,092
And it won't be like
learning a preexisting

214
00:12:17,126 --> 00:12:20,698
jutsu like the Rasengan that
can be broken down and taught

215
00:12:20,731 --> 00:12:23,602
in stages.

216
00:12:23,635 --> 00:12:25,739
-An enormous amount of time?

217
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:27,609
Are you people listening to me?

218
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:29,010
I just said we're
almost out of time!

219
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:30,179
Sasuke's gonna--

220
00:12:30,413 --> 00:12:32,015
-If you'd let me finish.

221
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:33,818
I figured out a way
to do it faster.

222
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:37,858
-How?

223
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:38,559
-Well--

224
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:39,528
[door sliding]

225
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:41,664
ASUMA: How you feeling
today, Kakashi?

226
00:12:41,698 --> 00:12:45,036
-Asuma-sensei, you really should
try knocking first, you know.

227
00:12:45,036 --> 00:12:48,642
CHOJI: What's up, guys?

228
00:12:48,675 --> 00:12:49,743
-Look who's here.

229
00:12:49,743 --> 00:12:51,880
It's Naruto and Sakura.

230
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,650
Guess your mission
must be-- hmm?

231
00:12:56,487 --> 00:12:57,422
I know you.

232
00:12:57,456 --> 00:12:59,792
You're that guy
from-- [growling]

233
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:01,128
-Doh!

234
00:13:01,161 --> 00:13:02,062
-Huh?

235
00:13:02,096 --> 00:13:03,431
What guy?

236
00:13:03,465 --> 00:13:06,636
-(TO HIMSELF): Why is
all this happening today?

237
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,638
Relax.

238
00:13:07,672 --> 00:13:11,010
Remember, start with a smile.

239
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:13,047
Hello there.

240
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,450
-Thank you for your report.

241
00:13:15,484 --> 00:13:16,185
-Of course.

242
00:13:16,185 --> 00:13:17,587
I'll head out now.

243
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,189
[poof]

244
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:21,059
-It sounds like the
Akatsuki are really

245
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:23,630
starting to make
their move, my lady.

246
00:13:23,663 --> 00:13:25,533
Which means it's
only a matter of time

247
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:28,070
before they venture closer
to this area, maybe even

248
00:13:28,103 --> 00:13:30,775
assault the Leaf Village.

249
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:31,642
-True.

250
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:33,980
This is a dangerous development.

251
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:37,919
But it could also be our
chance to smash them.

252
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,789
We've got no time left to lose.

253
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:47,968
-Oh, I see.

254
00:13:48,002 --> 00:13:50,205
So that's what
that was all about.

255
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:52,608
I guess I guy that. [munching]

256
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:54,144
-My name is Sai.

257
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:56,615
You can feel free to be casual.

258
00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:00,054
-Hey, that new guy's pretty
cute, don't you think?

259
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:02,658
He even kind of
looks like Sasuke.

260
00:14:02,691 --> 00:14:03,660
-On the outside, maybe.

261
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,062
But inside?

262
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:05,930
No way.

263
00:14:05,963 --> 00:14:08,801
He can't read people's emotions.

264
00:14:08,835 --> 00:14:10,204
[chomping]

265
00:14:14,143 --> 00:14:17,181
-Lady Tsunade told me
what happened with Sasuke.

266
00:14:17,215 --> 00:14:19,184
Next time something
like that comes up,

267
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:20,820
I'll be around to help.

268
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,193
Especially now that I'm
done with the chunin exams.

269
00:14:25,227 --> 00:14:29,500
Oh yeah, you missed out on
becoming a chunin again, huh?

270
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:32,471
-That's right.

271
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:35,142
-Well, I guess that's the
least of your problems.

272
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:41,552
-Why'd you bring the whole
gang in here, of all places?

273
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:44,523
This isn't a rec room, you know?

274
00:14:44,557 --> 00:14:45,826
-You have a point.

275
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:49,498
Why don't you guys head on over
to the barbecue restaurant.

276
00:14:49,531 --> 00:14:51,701
And Team Kakashi, you're
more than welcome to join us

277
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:52,837
if you'd like to.

278
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,638
-Barbecue!

279
00:14:53,671 --> 00:14:54,573
Woohoo!

280
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:56,542
-I second that.

281
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:59,748
(TO HERSELF) [giggling]
And I'll sit next to Sai.

282
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:05,723
-I need to talk to Kakashi
alone about some business.

283
00:15:05,757 --> 00:15:08,628
In the meantime, the
barbecue's on me, OK?

284
00:15:08,662 --> 00:15:09,262
-Hmm?

285
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:10,965
-Hey, wait a sec.

286
00:15:10,998 --> 00:15:12,567
Sensei, what gives?

287
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:14,170
What happened to that
whole conversation

288
00:15:14,203 --> 00:15:17,042
we were just having about
my special training?

289
00:15:17,075 --> 00:15:19,111
-Oh, that's right.

290
00:15:19,145 --> 00:15:20,047
Hmm.

291
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,916
We'll get back to it later.

292
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:22,817
-Eh?

293
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,786
What?

294
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:24,586
Later?

295
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,056
But it was getting good.

296
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:28,125
-Well, we can't start
anything while I'm still

297
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,594
in the hospital.

298
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,965
Don't be so impatient, Naruto.

299
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:32,833
[growls]

300
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:40,946
-What took you so long, Sakura?

301
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,647
-What?

302
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,550
Where's Shikamaru?

303
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,288
-Oh, he said he had to go
home and help his father find

304
00:15:46,521 --> 00:15:48,524
antlers to use as
some kind of medicine.

305
00:15:48,558 --> 00:15:49,225
-Huh?

306
00:15:49,258 --> 00:15:51,128
That's weird.

307
00:15:51,128 --> 00:15:53,933
He always showed up to celebrate
successful missions with us

308
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:54,868
before.

309
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:56,604
This is a first.

310
00:15:56,604 --> 00:15:58,841
SAKURA (TO HERSELF): She's
ignoring what I told her.

311
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,810
CHOJI: All right!

312
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:02,213
Then I get Shikamaru's share.

313
00:16:02,246 --> 00:16:03,782
INO: Knock it off, Choji!

314
00:16:03,815 --> 00:16:04,850
-Eek!

315
00:16:04,883 --> 00:16:06,619
INO: We should be
polite and introduce

316
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:08,857
ourselves to Sai before we eat.

317
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,657
-Oh yeah.

318
00:16:09,691 --> 00:16:10,926
Of course.

319
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,910
-Word is, things
are really starting

320
00:16:21,943 --> 00:16:24,615
to heat up outside the village.

321
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:26,183
-I figured.

322
00:16:26,217 --> 00:16:29,121
As long as their objectives
are the tailed beasts,

323
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,793
we can be certain they'll
come here sooner or later.

324
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:32,994
They want Naruto.

325
00:16:33,027 --> 00:16:34,196
[door sliding open]

326
00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:36,032
-Hmm?

327
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:38,335
-You guys don't need to
leave me out of this.

328
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,643
I'm just as concerned about
the Akatsuki as you are.

329
00:16:42,676 --> 00:16:46,682
And Naruto-- is
he going to be OK?

330
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,986
What if those guys from
the Akatsuki attack?

331
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,621
Even Gaara couldn't--

332
00:16:50,621 --> 00:16:51,290
-You're right.

333
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,059
He wouldn't be able to do it.

334
00:16:53,093 --> 00:16:54,562
[gasping]

335
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:59,001
-Well, not yet.

336
00:17:01,773 --> 00:17:03,976
-Mmm. [giggling]

337
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:05,312
-Well, then.

338
00:17:05,312 --> 00:17:08,584
(TO HIMSELF) First impressions
are very important to people,

339
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:11,020
so I've got to come up
with some casual nicknames

340
00:17:11,054 --> 00:17:12,790
as fast as I can.

341
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,860
-So, uh, hi there.

342
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:17,764
I'm Choji Akimichi
of the Akimichi Clan.

343
00:17:17,764 --> 00:17:20,336
And uh, your name
is Sai, isn't it?

344
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:22,706
-That's right, you
uh-- (TO HIMSELF)

345
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:24,709
personality trait,
personality trait.

346
00:17:24,742 --> 00:17:25,276
[gasps]

347
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:26,745
-(TO HERSELF): On no!

348
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:28,882
-(TO HIMSELF): He's not gonna
say that forbidden word, is he?

349
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:32,228
-Fat--

350
00:17:32,228 --> 00:17:32,755
--Hmm?

351
00:17:32,788 --> 00:17:33,230
-Eek!

352
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,092
[slap]

353
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,931
-Sai, fatso is absolutely a
taboo word in front of Choji.

354
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:40,200
Ya got it?

355
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,202
-Mmhmm.

356
00:17:41,235 --> 00:17:42,971
-Hey, where you about
to say something?

357
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:44,807
--[giggling nervously]
No, it was nothing.

358
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:45,675
Forget it.

359
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,044
-OK.

360
00:17:47,077 --> 00:17:48,880
[sighs]

361
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:52,653
-(TO HIMSELF): Coming up
with nicknames is tough.

362
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:54,756
-Anyway, I'm Ino Yamanaka.

363
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:57,627
My family owns the
Yamanaka flower shop next.

364
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,931
Nice to meet you.

365
00:17:59,931 --> 00:18:00,899
-Heeyah.

366
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:01,934
SAKURA: Let me at him!

367
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:03,670
SAI (TO HIMSELF): When
it comes to women,

368
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:07,275
stating their personality traits
too bluntly might anger them.

369
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:09,213
So perhaps I can
avoid that if I just

370
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:11,649
say the opposite
of what I think.

371
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:16,224
SAKURA (TO HERSELF):
Don't say it, Sai.

372
00:18:16,257 --> 00:18:19,094
DARK SAKURA: Come on, say it!

373
00:18:19,127 --> 00:18:24,002
Let her have it good,
just like you did to me!

374
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:28,977
-A pleasure, you uh,
you um, beautiful.

375
00:18:34,185 --> 00:18:35,754
[sighing]

376
00:18:41,096 --> 00:18:45,669
--[growling] You
call her beautiful?

377
00:18:45,702 --> 00:18:46,738
Why, you-- haiyah!

378
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:48,107
[plates breaking]

379
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:50,677
NARUTO: Aah, take
it easy, Sakura!

380
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,679

-Keh.

386
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:22,922
It's the wrong one.

387
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:30,568
[theme music]

388
00:22:00,142 --> 00:22:01,911
-OK, time for some training.

389
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,013
[giggles]

390
00:22:03,047 --> 00:22:04,114
-What is it?

391
00:22:04,148 --> 00:22:05,850
-Well, it's been pretty
long since the last time

392
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,153
I trained with you.

393
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:10,131
I don't really know why, but I'm
psyched to be back in action.

394
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:10,899
-I see.

395
00:22:10,932 --> 00:22:14,269
[giggling]

396
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:16,104
-Well, you better laugh
it up while you can.

397
00:22:16,104 --> 00:22:17,405
-Hmm?

398
00:22:17,439 --> 00:22:19,441
-The purpose of this training
is to create a new ultimate need

399
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:23,044
ninjutsu just for you, one
that will surpass the Rasengan.

400
00:22:23,078 --> 00:22:23,845
-No way.

401
00:22:23,878 --> 00:22:25,313
Surpass the Rasengan?

402
00:22:25,347 --> 00:22:28,049
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Next time, "Wind."
