00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,070
[crying]

00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,090
[theme music]

3
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,160
[bells ringing]

4
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,192
-Asuma.

5
00:02:56,972 --> 00:02:57,972
-Uncle Asuma.

6
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,012
-Where is he?

7
00:03:03,012 --> 00:03:04,902
-His mom said that
that he had already

8
00:03:04,912 --> 00:03:05,992
left when I went by his house.

9
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:20,942
-Come on, it's my turn!

10
00:03:20,952 --> 00:03:22,072
-Over here!

11
00:03:22,082 --> 00:03:23,892
-Give it!

12
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:25,002
-Hey, you two!

13
00:03:25,012 --> 00:03:27,032
How many times do
I have to tell you

14
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:29,022
kids not to play
around on the roof?

15
00:03:29,032 --> 00:03:29,912
-We're sorry!

16
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,922
[laughter]

17
00:04:01,902 --> 00:04:04,872
-Well, hi there, Shikamaru.

18
00:04:04,882 --> 00:04:06,862
-Uh, hey.

19
00:04:06,862 --> 00:04:07,902
-Haven't seen you in a while.

20
00:04:07,912 --> 00:04:08,912
You been busy?

21
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:09,952
-Kinda, yeah.

22
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:11,922
-Well, stop in soon.

23
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:15,912
Oh, and tell Asuma-sensei
and Choji I say hello.

24
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,892
Which reminds me,
we have to work out

25
00:04:17,902 --> 00:04:20,912
Asuma's tab when he comes in.

26
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:22,912
-Asuma was-- well--

27
00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:25,022
-Yeah?

28
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,072
-Killed in the line of duty.

29
00:04:30,952 --> 00:04:39,852
-So, the shinobi who
was lost yesterday-- no.

30
00:05:03,962 --> 00:05:05,852
-Shikamaru?

31
00:05:05,862 --> 00:05:06,882
Dinner's almost already.

32
00:05:09,082 --> 00:05:11,932
-I'm, um, not
really that hungry.

33
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:26,852
-Shikamaru.

34
00:05:26,862 --> 00:05:28,882
Come spend some time
with your old man.

35
00:05:55,912 --> 00:05:57,852
Your game is a
little off tonight.

36
00:06:01,032 --> 00:06:03,852
You're not going
to win like that.

37
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:04,339
-Whatever, Dad.

38
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:14,892
-That Akatsuki.

39
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:17,022
They're strong, aren't they?

40
00:06:17,032 --> 00:06:19,082
-Yeah.

41
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:21,862
-So, what's your plan?

42
00:06:27,902 --> 00:06:31,882
If someone like Asuma
couldn't handle them,

43
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:32,992
what shot do you
think you'd have?

44
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:39,932
Sarutobi was a hell of a guy.

45
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,972
-I know.

46
00:06:41,982 --> 00:06:43,022
-Not so hot at Shogi, though.

47
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:56,942
You know what you're doing?

48
00:06:56,952 --> 00:06:59,882
-Look, you play your
way, and I'll play mine.

49
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:01,022
-No, son.

50
00:07:01,032 --> 00:07:02,872
I'm not talking about Shogi.

51
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,022
Well, you wouldn't do
anything stupid, I suppose.

52
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:22,982
I'm lucky in that respect.

53
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:29,052
Who wants to go to
their own son's funeral?

54
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:34,892
You've done well for yourself.

55
00:07:34,902 --> 00:07:38,872
I'm very proud to
be your father.

56
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:42,002
You're as sharp as they
come, with great talent.

57
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:44,032
Someone the Leaf can
depend on in the future.

58
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:51,932
But now, Asuma is dead.

59
00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:02,002
-Just what are you
getting at, here?

60
00:08:02,002 --> 00:08:04,862
-Only the truth.

61
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:06,002
-Will you shut your mouth?

62
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:08,882
All this talking
is making me sick.

63
00:08:08,892 --> 00:08:09,962
Say what you want.

64
00:08:09,962 --> 00:08:12,022
I'm still nothing
but a useless coward.

65
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:13,022
-You're wrong.

66
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:14,082
-What do you want from me?

67
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:28,932
-Let it out, boy.

68
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:39,082
All of the anger, the
sadness, and the fear.

69
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,082
Everything that's
brewing inside of you.

70
00:08:42,852 --> 00:08:43,972
You've got to let it go.

71
00:08:55,892 --> 00:08:58,972
It all starts from there, son.

72
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:17,902
[sobbing]

73
00:09:17,912 --> 00:09:21,062
-Remember, I'll be here for you.

74
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:24,932
[sobbing]

75
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:36,902
-Huh?

76
00:12:11,912 --> 00:12:12,401
-Hm.

77
00:12:23,912 --> 00:12:24,411
BOY: Whoa!

78
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:25,072
BOY: Oh, man.

79
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:26,082
I almost tripped.

80
00:12:26,852 --> 00:12:28,992
BOY: You almost got me!

81
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:33,852
[laughter]

82
00:12:33,862 --> 00:12:34,554
-Over here!

83
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:36,875
-Wait, where are you going?

84
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:38,865
[laughter]

85
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,775
-I'm gonna get you!

86
00:12:41,785 --> 00:12:42,995
-You can't catch me!

87
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:46,935
Look how fast I can run!

88
00:12:46,945 --> 00:12:47,955
I'm going so fast!

89
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:18,345
-Hey.

90
00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:22,805
-Shikamaru.

91
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,925
-Good morning.

92
00:13:23,925 --> 00:13:25,845
-Oh, it must have
been so hard on you.

93
00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:27,925
Seeing Asuma.

94
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,805
Oh, there aren't any words.

95
00:13:29,815 --> 00:13:32,765
You poor, poor boys.

96
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:34,785
-Shikamaru.

97
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:36,835
-Darling?

98
00:13:36,845 --> 00:13:39,785
-You must be looking for Choji.

99
00:13:39,795 --> 00:13:40,855
he's in the hills out back.

100
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:52,825
-Hm?

101
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:01,855
[grumbling sounds]

102
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:15,895
SHIKAMARU: I don't k You
think it's deep enough?

103
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:16,975
-Shikamaru!

104
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:19,945
[stomach grumbling]

105
00:14:19,955 --> 00:14:21,855
[laughter]

106
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:22,915
-Just saw your mom.

107
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:23,985
Brought you a little something.

108
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:42,905
-So when do we do it?

109
00:14:42,905 --> 00:14:43,785
-Huh?

110
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:54,915
You're gonna do it?

111
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:55,885
Right?

112
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,855
How can I help?

113
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,885
Wait a second.

114
00:15:00,895 --> 00:15:04,815
Are you telling me that
you don't want me to--

115
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:11,785
-Well, actually, there
is one thing you can do.

116
00:15:11,795 --> 00:15:12,945
-Ah?

117
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:13,825
Mm-hm?

118
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:30,985
-Huh?

119
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:32,975
-Shikamaru!

120
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:33,995
We're gonna do it, right?

121
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:07,805
-Thank you.

122
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:08,294
-Huh?

123
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:39,835
-Forgive me.

124
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:43,775
I know I'm late.

125
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:48,885
I was a little lost,
but I'm good now.

126
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:54,805
We're about to try something
pretty crazy, so please,

127
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:55,895
keep an eye on us, OK?

128
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:05,875
-Asuma-sensei.

129
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:10,344
-Asuma-sensei.

130
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:13,845
-Asuma-sensei.

131
00:17:47,975 --> 00:17:49,905
-Ready to head out?

132
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:52,775
-Let's go, Shikamaru.

133
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:53,273
-All right.

134
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:03,895
TSUNADE: Hold it!

135
00:18:03,905 --> 00:18:05,785
-Huh?

136
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:06,995
-Milady.

137
00:18:07,765 --> 00:18:09,835
-You going somewhere?

138
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:12,835
-Your mission directive
still stands, right?

139
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:14,925
I've just assembled a new team.

140
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:16,925
We're going ahead
with the mission.

141
00:18:16,935 --> 00:18:18,885
-Not without my
approval, you're not.

142
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:25,775
Shikamaru, you will be assigned
to a troop of my choosing,

143
00:18:25,785 --> 00:18:29,775
and only when we have a solid
plan of attack in place.

144
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:32,915
-Listen, just send some
reinforcements after us.

145
00:18:32,915 --> 00:18:35,925
The three of us have already
worked out our own strategy.

146
00:18:35,935 --> 00:18:38,795
-I've heard enough!

147
00:18:38,795 --> 00:18:39,895
Asuma is dead.

148
00:18:39,905 --> 00:18:41,995
There's only three of you.

149
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,875
-That's not true.

150
00:18:43,885 --> 00:18:45,765
Asua's still with us.

151
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:47,785
-You're after vengeance,
then, are you?

152
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:48,985
This isn't like you at all.

153
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:51,775
Are you so eager to die?

154
00:18:51,785 --> 00:18:52,965
-We're not stupid.

155
00:18:52,975 --> 00:18:55,915
We have no intention of
running straight to our deaths.

156
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:57,915
Believe me.

157
00:18:57,925 --> 00:18:59,965
It's just--

158
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:00,945
-Well?

159
00:19:00,955 --> 00:19:03,855
Just what?

160
00:19:03,865 --> 00:19:05,895
-We don't want to
run away, and just

161
00:19:05,905 --> 00:19:10,845
go on living without
fulfilling our duty.

162
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:13,765
We aren't going to
live without meaning.

163
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:14,282
That's why we're going.

164
00:19:18,795 --> 00:19:19,945
-Grow up, you three.

165
00:19:19,955 --> 00:19:22,865
The shadow of death
hangs over us all.

166
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:27,975
Some deaths may be harder
to accept than others,

167
00:19:27,985 --> 00:19:30,935
but unless you can get past
that, there can be no future!

168
00:19:37,835 --> 00:19:40,815
-Carrying this
lighter around, it's

169
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:44,895
almost like Asuma's
still close by.

170
00:19:44,895 --> 00:19:47,795
Like he's watching over us.

171
00:19:47,805 --> 00:19:49,935
I really feel that.

172
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:52,895
Until I've close the
book on this thing,

173
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:55,985
his lighter will stay with me.

174
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,835
-Face reality.

175
00:19:57,845 --> 00:19:59,895
There's only three of you, OK?

176
00:19:59,895 --> 00:20:00,925
A full squad has--

177
00:20:00,935 --> 00:20:02,785
-A full squad has four.

178
00:20:02,795 --> 00:20:03,795
-Huh?

179
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:04,965
-Kakashi-sensei?

180
00:20:04,975 --> 00:20:08,875
-I'll take over as Team 10's
leader, and go with them.

181
00:20:08,885 --> 00:20:11,765
Fair enough?

182
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:13,765
-Kakashi, what are you--

183
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:14,200
-It's no use.

184
00:20:14,765 --> 00:20:16,795
They're just going
to go, anyway.

185
00:20:16,805 --> 00:20:18,835
I figure you might
as well send me along

186
00:20:18,845 --> 00:20:19,975
to keep an eye on them.

187
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,825
Make sure they
don't go overboard.

188
00:20:43,765 --> 00:20:44,775
-All right.

189
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,885
As you wish, then.

190
00:20:45,895 --> 00:20:46,765
-Yahoo!

191
00:20:48,945 --> 00:20:52,995
-But Kakashi-sensei,
what about Naruto?

192
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:54,955
-Huh?

193
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:55,885
-Your arm.

194
00:20:55,895 --> 00:20:56,805
It's--

195
00:20:56,815 --> 00:20:57,324
-Oh.

196
00:20:57,334 --> 00:20:58,815
It's nothing.

197
00:20:58,825 --> 00:20:59,995
He doesn't need
me at the moment.

198
00:21:00,765 --> 00:21:05,785
Plus, he's got another squad
leader with him now, so--

199
00:21:05,795 --> 00:21:06,895
-Man, that guy.

200
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:11,190
-All right.

201
00:21:11,241 --> 00:21:12,925
Team Asuma, let's go.

202
00:21:12,935 --> 00:21:13,825
-OK.

203
00:21:19,955 --> 00:21:21,915
SHIKAMARU: Thanks, Kakashi.

204
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:22,955
We owe you one.

205
00:21:28,785 --> 00:21:31,975
[theme music]

206
00:22:57,845 --> 00:22:58,865
KAKASHI: OK.

207
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:00,646
Time to go after so Akatsuki.

208
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:03,826
Shimamaru, let's hear
this plan of yours.

209
00:23:03,836 --> 00:23:05,676
-All write.

210
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:06,796
I'd like to tweak
it a bit, though,

211
00:23:06,806 --> 00:23:08,746
now that you're
along for the ride.

212
00:23:08,756 --> 00:23:09,786
-No problem.

213
00:23:09,796 --> 00:23:10,816
Go on.

214
00:23:10,826 --> 00:23:13,676
-I'll explain all of it
piece by piece for you,

215
00:23:13,686 --> 00:23:15,706
with all the
possible variations.

216
00:23:15,716 --> 00:23:18,826
Everyone listen carefully, and
be sure you've got it down.

217
00:23:18,836 --> 00:23:20,776
-You've got it.

218
00:23:20,786 --> 00:23:24,676
NARUTO: Next time,
Target Locked On.
