He fought the Leaf in
the Third Great Ninja

{\an1}Oh, so I'm famous
now, am I? [chuckle]

only observe you from
afar in battle..

16
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:14,112
{\an5}But as a fellow
Taijutsu User, it is
a great honor to be
able to fight you now.

{\an4}I don't understand. He
died before you were even
born. So how could you
have possibly met him?

42

{\an1}Hmph. So I see that
you are still a shinobi.

{\an1}It is important that
one ever give up on

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,832
{\an4}Oh, that is right!
I never told you
about this part of
my past, Guy Sensei.

59
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:19,399
{\an3}Huh?

60
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:27,016
{\an8}If I recall correctly,
it happened soon after
I had recovered from
my serious injuries...

61
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:31,792
{\an4}You guys! Take a
look... I just
stumbled upon it
in the library.

Whoa..!

63
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:37,171
What's the Leaf
Dragon God?

64
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:40,611
{\an1}A secret technique
created by someone
called Old Master Chen.

65
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:44,787
{\an5}[giggle]
The words "secret
technique" get me
all amped up!

66
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,960
{\an1}Let us go find this
Master Chen and ask
him to teach it to us!

67
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:49,797
{\an1}Wait, we can't!

68
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,672
{\an4}This scroll says that he
was a hero from the
Hidden Leaf who died in
the Third Great Ninja War.

69
00:05:53,706 --> 00:05:56,145
What!? He's dead!?
Well that sucks.

70
00:05:56,178 --> 00:06:01,856
{\an4}It is okay! I am sure
that everything about
the Leaf Dragon God is
written right here!

{\an1}Oh no! It is gone!

72
00:06:05,864 --> 00:06:10,742
{\an4}I wanted to master this
while Guy Sensei was away
and show him how much
stronger I had become!

come and train with me?

get! I gotta get stronger
so that I can bring Sasuke
back to the Village.

guy's grave isn't very
far from here at all.

our respects at the
hero's grave!

us to train hard!

here every day, Azami?

Yeah, it's my
grandpa's grave.

of the deceased Master!

know how to do the
Leaf Dragon God?

doesn't, you guys!

say that...

149
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:29,925
Huh?

150
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,765
So, here... take
this along with you.

151
00:10:35,771 --> 00:10:38,477
Azami asked me to
give it to you
before you left!

152
00:10:38,845 --> 00:10:40,648
Thank you both
very much!

153
00:11:12,148 --> 00:11:14,654
{\an1}[sigh]

154
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,635
{\an1}Well you certainly
are persistent.

155
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:25,142
I will not ask you
to teach me the
Leaf Dragon God.

156
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:29,551
{\an5}But, please! All I ask
is that you attack me
with that technique one
more time...

157
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:32,525
{\an1}Huh?

158
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:36,199
You told me that I am
not qualified to be a
shinobi...

159
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:40,609
I am sorry, but I
cannot accept that.
I <i>will</i> not accept it!

160
00:11:41,477 --> 00:11:43,716
So I will try again to
defeat your technique.

161
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:48,659
And if I do, you
will acknowledge
me as a shinobi!

162
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:52,600
Please, I beg you!
Use your Leaf Dragon
God against me!

163
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,858
{\an1}Your tenacity has won
me over. I will honor
your request.

164
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:04,793
{\an3}Huh?

165
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,336
{\an4}Although I doubt that
you will be able to
see the truth of the
Dragon's Eye.

166
00:12:09,904 --> 00:12:10,940
Dragon's... Eye..?

167
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:17,386
{\an1}Now I will make you
see just how unqualified
you are to be a shinobi!

168
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:21,495
I will show you! You
will acknowledge me!

169
00:12:22,664 --> 00:12:25,370
{\an1}Leaf Dragon God!

170
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,957

you won't give up when
you've been beaten so
badly!

{\an1}You're exactly

{\an3}Huh?

189
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,844
{\an1}In any case, forget
being a shinobi.

190
00:14:04,581 --> 00:14:11,061
{\an1}No! I can never, ever--
give up on my dream of
being a shinobi. I will not!

191
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:16,974
{\an5}I <i>will</i> become a
shinobi! I will risk
my whole life to
achieve that!

192
00:14:17,007 --> 00:14:20,581
[groan] I made a
promise to Guy Sensei!

193
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:27,230
And you are trying
to reject it! So I
cannot lose to you!

194
00:14:27,263 --> 00:14:30,669
Please! Just one
more time..!

195
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:34,577
{\an1}You must abandon
your dream...

196
00:14:34,611 --> 00:14:37,083
{\an1}I say this only
for your own sake!

197
00:14:37,117 --> 00:14:38,920
Please-- wait!

198
00:14:43,196 --> 00:14:47,338
And after that, I
never once laid
eyes on him again.

199
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:51,079
For Lee's sake, you
told him to abandon
his dream.

200
00:14:51,113 --> 00:14:57,593
{\an4}Someone who isn't able
to perform ninjutsu would
be nearly powerless in the
dangerous world of shinobi.

201
00:14:57,626 --> 00:15:02,671
{\an5}Perhaps you're right
that people like
that shouldn't aim
to become shinobi.

202
00:15:04,174 --> 00:15:09,986
{\an4}And when you told Lee to
give up on being a shinobi,
you weren't really wrong,
I have to admit that.

203
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,993
{\an1}[gasp] Guy Sensei!?
How could--!?

204
00:15:13,026 --> 00:15:17,202
However... that's
something I will
never accept!

205
00:15:17,235 --> 00:15:18,036
{\an1}Hm?

206
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,277
What you did was
undeniably wrong!

207
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:24,684
{\an1}Guy Sensei!

208
00:15:27,757 --> 00:15:31,732
{\an1}I thought for sure that
you would understand me,
but I guess that instead--

209
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:36,075
{\an4}I'll prove to you both,
teacher and pupil, that
you're the ones who are
wrong!

210
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:38,780
That's the lesson you're
about to learn! Just you
watch!

211
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:40,852
Now, you ready
to show him, Lee!?

212
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:41,954
{\an1}Yes, sir!

213
00:15:41,987 --> 00:15:43,057
{\an1}Huh?

214
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:49,937
{\an1}Never once did I think
this moment would come.

already?!

I will never give up!

can this be..?

234
00:17:52,732 --> 00:17:58,611
{\an1}And how is it possible
that you didn't give up
after everything you faced?

235
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:03,220
{\an4}I once sustained severe
injuries, and I was on
the brink of giving up
on all of my dreams...

{\an1}[gasp]

237
00:18:05,091 --> 00:18:09,032
{\an1}But luckily... Guy
Sensei said something
to me then...

238
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:14,445
{\an4}Listen, Lee. If you wish to
be freed of this suffering,
then you're going to need to
come to a decision!

should be prepared to
give up on my dreams?

your dreams, you'll undergo

{\an1}You know, I took on
a pupil who was like
you a long time ago.

259
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:42,900
{\an1}<i>And just like you, he</i>
<i>was completely unable</i>
<i>to use ninjutsu.</i>

260
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:47,709
{\an1}<i>But he said he would</i>
<i>become a shinobi using</i>
<i>only taijutsu...</i>

261
00:19:47,743 --> 00:19:51,450
{\an1}<i>And through hard training</i>
<i>he realized his dream.</i>

262
00:19:51,484 --> 00:19:56,394
{\an1}<i>He was to be initiated in</i>
<i>the ways of the Leaf </i>
<i>Dragon God, but then...</i>

263
00:19:56,427 --> 00:19:58,599
{\an1}<i>...The Third Great</i>
<i>Ninja War broke out...</i>

264
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,242
{\an1}<i>And my sole pupil</i>
<i>was sent off to fight</i>
<i>on the battlefield.</i>

265
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:07,886
{\an4}<i>For him, being unable</i>
<i>to use ninjutsu and</i>
<i>genjutsu was a great</i>
<i>weakness...</i>

266
00:20:10,457 --> 00:20:12,829
{\an1}<i>...and much to my</i>
<i>regret, he was killed.</i>

267
00:20:15,468 --> 00:20:21,380
{\an4}<i>I allowed my pupil to become</i>
<i>a shinobi without thinking of</i>
<i>the consequences! I'm not</i>
<i>qualified to be a master!</i>

268
00:20:21,413 --> 00:20:28,328
{\an7}I was unable to forgive myself,
so I abandoned my shinobi life,
faked my own death, and put up
a phony gravestone.

269
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:29,965
Oh, I see... So
that's what happened
then...

270
00:20:32,638 --> 00:20:34,541
{\an1}I hope you can
forgive me.

271
00:20:34,575 --> 00:20:40,054
{\an4}I thought you would walk
the same path as my pupil,
and that's why I told you
to give up your dream...
