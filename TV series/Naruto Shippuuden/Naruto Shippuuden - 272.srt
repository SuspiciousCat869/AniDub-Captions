1
00:00:11,891 --> 00:00:14,428
It's no use! We can't
lose them!

2
00:00:14,462 --> 00:00:16,432
Tango! Get HQ!

3
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:17,334
Hm!

4
00:00:20,407 --> 00:00:24,215
The Commando Unit is
reporting in. They're
attempting to retreat,
but the enemy pursuit

5
00:00:24,248 --> 00:00:26,987
team is closing in on
them.

6
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:30,427
A relief team from the
Fifth Company was already
dispatched.

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,402
Send them the coordinates
of the closest rendezvous
point and quickly!

8
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:54,776
It's just one faction,
but they're voicing
opposition vehemently.

9
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,383
They're saying that
samurai must remain
neutral, so they're
wondering why they

10
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:01,557
should team up
with shinobi.

11
00:01:03,293 --> 00:01:05,732
So samurai should remain
neutral, should they?

12
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:09,338
They only say such
things because they
don't know the past.

13
00:01:09,372 --> 00:01:13,246
But even more than that,
they don't understand the
current situation.

14
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,189
<i>Some also say that a</i>
<i>shinobi war should be</i>
<i>resolved by the shinobi</i>
<i>themselves.</i>

15
00:01:18,223 --> 00:01:25,070
Yet these former foes all
keep squabbling... and they
still cannot find a common
ground to unite them.

16
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,593
How do they realistically
expect to end this war
without our help?

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,375
All of you, head out! And
show them how we samurai
fight!

18
00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:45,277
Sir!

19
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:33,059
"Mifune vs. Hanzo"

20
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:35,363
I said I wanted out of
here! Hmph!

21
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:43,814
I can feel Orochimaru's
chakra pass through my
skull, seeping into my
flesh and bones.

22
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,785
I must succeed.

23
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:47,421
It's over there.

24
00:03:47,454 --> 00:03:51,229
I don't care if it was
the Akatsuki or
Orochimaru!

25
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:54,034
Whoever reanimated
me is going to regret it.

26
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:58,944
Everyone is going to
think I've been playing
possum again! It's just
so undignified!

27
00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:02,585
I'm trying to
concentrate! Be quiet,
puppet granny!

28
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:06,794
No, I won't! You shut up,
old man snorkel face!

29
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:10,333
Just a little further.

30
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:13,741
This distance should
work. Summoning Jutsu!

31
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:14,810
Huh?!

32
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,519
Do it, Ibuse!

33
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,761
The Poison Fog!

34
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:29,506
[grunting and coughing]

35
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:40,828
[coughing]

36
00:04:40,862 --> 00:04:45,838
He resorted to poison
because he was tired of
chasing us?! Damn it!

37
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:50,715
I should be resistant to
poison... but my body's
going numb.

38
00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:57,461
Are those reinforcements!
Hey, I'm over here! Hmph!

39
00:05:01,603 --> 00:05:02,739
Gotcha.

40
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,279
No!

41
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,024
Lord Hanzo, I presume?

42
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:17,301
My name is Mifune, leader
of the samurai. I desire
to battle you!

43
00:05:17,802 --> 00:05:18,737
We're saved.

44
00:05:18,771 --> 00:05:20,407
Sorry we're late.

45
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,543
Are you all right?

46
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:24,381
<i>Careful. The enemy uses</i>
<i>poison.</i>

47
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:30,093
Our masks are specially
designed for fighting
shinobi and are
impervious to poison gas.

48
00:05:30,126 --> 00:05:31,630
Here, put this on.

49
00:05:31,663 --> 00:05:33,233
Thanks.

50
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,740
They need antidotes! Get
these Commando Unit
members to the Medical
Corps, stat!

51
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:39,378
Lord Mifune!

52
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:43,721
Assistance is
unnecessary! Stay out of
the way if you do not
want to get injured.

53
00:05:43,754 --> 00:05:48,062
So you're Mifune. Why do
you side with the
shinobi?

54
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:54,208
No,... an even better
question is why stay with
the shinobi? You are
staunchly samurai.

55
00:05:54,241 --> 00:05:57,582
To serve shinobi is against
your nature.

56
00:05:57,615 --> 00:06:00,755
How can you still call
yourselves samurai?

57
00:06:00,788 --> 00:06:03,493
You're wrong. We do not
serve the shinobi.

58
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:09,405
The one master that we
follow has never changed
since the olden days, and
that master...

59
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:14,950
... is called peace!

60
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:16,485
Peace?!

61
00:06:17,956 --> 00:06:21,663
We pledge ourselves to
peace, and then we act
based upon that
conviction!

62
00:06:27,842 --> 00:06:29,512
[chuckling]

63
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:31,917
The battlefield is
getting lively.

64
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:34,421
Now, then...

65
00:06:36,392 --> 00:06:37,996
Lady Chiyo!

66
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:42,672
I haven't been playing
possum. You know that,
right, Kankuro?

67
00:06:42,705 --> 00:06:44,008
Uh, yes?

68
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:49,018
But never mind that for
now. Hanzo controls a
venomous salamander!

69
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:52,659
I have fought against him
many times in my day.

70
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:55,932
That is why I know how to
concoct an antidote to
its poison.

71
00:06:55,965 --> 00:07:02,679
I am also aware that the
salamander takes five
minutes to work up more
venom once it releases it.

72
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:07,020
That interfering hag is
blabbing my secrets!

73
00:07:07,054 --> 00:07:09,993
Ibuse! Withdraw for now!

74
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,707
Heh.

75
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,518
Even though I'm being
manipulated
I won't be forced to
fight them right now.

76
00:07:22,552 --> 00:07:24,321
Then you, Hanzo...

77
00:07:24,355 --> 00:07:29,633
You must know who my
original foe in battle
was... do you not?

78
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:31,035
Uh--

79
00:07:31,068 --> 00:07:34,108
I won't hold back from
fighting the Five Great
Nations!

80
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:43,159
All right...

81
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:44,596
I'll go.

82
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,737
Here he comes!

83
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:56,018
So solid!

84
00:07:56,052 --> 00:07:58,022
[groaning]

85
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:01,697
[gasping]

86
00:08:06,272 --> 00:08:09,879
You countered that quite
nicely.

87
00:08:09,913 --> 00:08:15,190
You fight well... for a
weak man of peace and
neutrality, that is.

88
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,534
Don't look at me that
way. I once sought peace,
too.

89
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:25,878
I was going to unite all
the Five Great Nations
into one shinobi world.

90
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:29,986
But I quickly realized
that true peace does not
exist.

91
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,656
And when was that?

92
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:38,771
Battle after battle after
battle... The only thing
left and the end of it
all is death!

93
00:08:38,804 --> 00:08:42,077
You pledge yourselves to
peace?!

94
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,285
You more than any other
know best what has
happened to the samurai.

95
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:52,598
Many samurai have become
shinobi instead, and your
techniques have passed
over to the shinobi.

96
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,738
Capture them!

97
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:59,244
Sorry, my body is acting
on its own and fleeing.

98
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,086
There is no longer a role
for samurai in this world
at all.

99
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:09,398
Shinobi have no devotion
to peace. They are
ruled by money and
ninjutsu and power.

100
00:09:09,431 --> 00:09:10,801
Ahhhh!

101
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:15,043
They fight, they die, and
they leave nothing
behind.

102
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:17,013
And I am the same!

103
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:21,623
No, you are wrong. It's
not about life or death.

104
00:09:21,656 --> 00:09:27,134
It doesn't bother me in
the slightest if I should
lose my life in the
pursuit of peace!

105
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:32,779
What drives me, pushes me
forward, is my conviction.
Yours has become warped.

106
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:37,053
According to the Samurai
Way, people themselves
are swords.

107
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:42,932
And thus one can live on
in others' memories, like
my famed sword Kurosawa.

108
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:49,646
Do not compare people to
blades! What can you
possibly glean from some
cold lump of iron?

109
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:55,758
Take your ritual of
seppuku... Why do you
samurai try to diminish
your own lives so much?

110
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,995
It doesn't make any
sense!

111
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:02,672
I've already explained
it. Our conviction lives
on forever!

112
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:08,584
Hah! Enough of this
nonsense! I shall erase
you samurai, once and for
all!

113
00:10:09,552 --> 00:10:10,286
Huh?!

114
00:10:13,894 --> 00:10:17,935
And I will keep you from
casting ninjutsu from
here on out.

115
00:10:24,816 --> 00:10:27,822
You live up to your
reputation as an expert
swordsman.

116
00:10:27,855 --> 00:10:31,730
So this is why they say
ninjutsu is useless
against you.

117
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:35,638
You left me no time to
weave signs.

118
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:38,744
And my two-step sickle
and chain attack...

119
00:10:38,777 --> 00:10:42,484
Even those familiar with
it have never managed to
avoid it.

120
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:47,662
In the distant past, when
my name was still unknown,
we actually exchanged blows
once.

121
00:10:47,695 --> 00:10:49,498
Though I doubt you would
remember it...

122
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:52,304
Oh? Then why aren't you
dead?

123
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:56,378
You shattered my sword
with that sickle and chain
and you slashed my head!

124
00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:59,318
But even then,
somehow, I lived.

125
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:05,998
I see. So you were that
samurai...

126
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:10,306
I can't believe you
survived. I'll make sure
to finish you this time.

127
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:15,985
Sorry, but that's not
possible for you. I could
tell right from our first
exchange today why you,

128
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:17,855
who were once so
strong...

129
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:19,859
...could be defeated and
killed.

130
00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:22,197
What?! What do you mean?

131
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:27,007
Quite frankly, I can't
believe a shinobi of your
caliber doesn't know.

132
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,146
Don't you remember how
you met your end?

133
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:37,327
[grunting]

134
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,970
Who are you?! To think
you could drive me to
this point!

135
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,047
Have you forgotten my
face, Hanzo?

136
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,349
<i>You!</i>

137
00:11:48,382 --> 00:11:52,959
You're Yahiko of the
Akatsuki! But you're
dead! What's going on?!

138
00:11:52,992 --> 00:11:56,398
You allied yourself with
Danzo and then betrayed
us.

139
00:11:56,432 --> 00:12:00,808
You now only think of
self-preservation, you
piece of garbage.

140
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:02,244
Ah!

141
00:12:02,277 --> 00:12:04,147
<i>I once respected you.</i>

142
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:07,755
But... you have changed
much.

143
00:12:07,788 --> 00:12:12,197
Who are you?! How do you
have so much power?!

144
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,738
After everything that
you've done, you still
don't understand...

145
00:12:15,771 --> 00:12:18,476
...why exactly it is that
you have lost.

146
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,411
[gasping]

147
00:12:19,444 --> 00:12:21,115
<i>Begone, Hanzo!</i>

148
00:12:21,148 --> 00:12:22,217
Stop!

149
00:12:25,557 --> 00:12:27,628
What could they possibly
mean?

150
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:30,433
What is it that they see
but I do not?!

151
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:35,811
[gasping]

152
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,963
Be bathed in venom and
die! I've had enough of
your nonsense.

153
00:12:46,498 --> 00:12:47,802
What?!

154
00:12:49,338 --> 00:12:53,714
A sword that is
continuously honed will
gain renown and will be
passed on.

155
00:12:53,747 --> 00:12:55,116
And what's more...

156
00:13:14,656 --> 00:13:20,066
One who always stays true
to his convictions and
who defends them with all
of his might...

157
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:23,940
...shall become a hero
whose name remains sung
throughout the ages.

158
00:13:23,974 --> 00:13:27,180
How?! How were you able
to cut me?!

159
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:40,106
There's not even a single
stain on his blade. Is he
that fast?!

160
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:45,984
Your conviction has
become warped. You do not
hone yourself as a weapon
anymore, you no longer

161
00:13:46,018 --> 00:13:49,324
improve. You have lost
your sharpness.

162
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:55,136
Thus your blade
became sullied with blood,
rusted, its edge dulled.

163
00:13:55,169 --> 00:14:00,179
And a dull blade is
worthless! Remember,
people are like swords!

164
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:09,131
You didn't remember me at
first, but have you also
forgotten your final
words to me after you cut

165
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:12,505
me down and left me there
to die?

166
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,880
[panting]

167
00:14:16,913 --> 00:14:21,321
It's salamander venom.
My blade is coated with
it.

168
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:28,002
Fear not. The numbness
will take away your pain.
And within forty-eight
hours, you'll be dead.

169
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:33,479
Do you know why I am
feared as Hanzo the
Salamander? I shall
tell you my secret.

170
00:14:33,513 --> 00:14:36,753
You can consider it
to be a parting gift
for you.

171
00:14:36,786 --> 00:14:42,832
In my village, there once
lived a deadly, venomous
black salamander.

172
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:50,346
I was just a child, but
when the salamander died,
its venom sac was
implanted in me.

173
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:57,561
It was placed right
here,... in order to turn
me into a man capable of
producing my own poison.

174
00:14:57,595 --> 00:15:02,905
And I'm now able to
poison people... simply
by breathing on them.

175
00:15:02,938 --> 00:15:04,976
Of course, I was feared
as a child.

176
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:10,219
I had to use this
mask or I'd kill everyone
around me whenever I took
a breath.

177
00:15:10,253 --> 00:15:15,396
Then... why didn't you...
take off your mask during
our fight?

178
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:20,239
I've done that in other
fights in the past. But
there are risks.

179
00:15:20,273 --> 00:15:25,249
You see, this mask plays
one other role. It
protects me as well.

180
00:15:25,283 --> 00:15:28,255
If the venom sac is cut
open during battle
somehow...

181
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:32,130
... then the concentrated
venom inside will vaporize
and escape.

182
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:34,869
And likely, I
will inhale it.

183
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:40,213
Even with my resistance,
I would not be left
unharmed. The gas would
paralyze me, too.

184
00:15:40,246 --> 00:15:45,423
I wouldn't die. But I'd
be left vulnerable to
attack.

185
00:15:45,456 --> 00:15:49,765
Against a skilled
opponent like you, I
must keep the mask on
to prevent that.

186
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:52,137
I can't afford to
give you an advantage.

187
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:56,211
Though it seems that you
wielded a dull blade.

188
00:15:59,652 --> 00:16:02,157
People themselves
are swords.

189
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,966
Which means despite
my best efforts, I
wasn't sharp enough.

190
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:10,039
Let me tell you
something.

191
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:12,945
Death... is not the
end...

192
00:16:13,245 --> 00:16:14,982
Uh!

193
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:18,022
Loss of conviction is the
end.

194
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:24,267
It's quite a nuisance.
It's hard to discern
someone's conviction just
by looking at them.

195
00:16:24,301 --> 00:16:28,743
Even if you were to die
here, you wouldn't be
considered blunted or
dull.

196
00:16:28,777 --> 00:16:34,421
It's your companions,...
who abandoned the fight
at the start, fleeing in
fear upon hearing my

197
00:16:34,454 --> 00:16:38,329
name... who are
worthless lumps of iron.

198
00:16:38,362 --> 00:16:40,868
[panicking]
Hanzo the Salamander!

199
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:43,305
Run!

200
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:47,413
You valiantly used your
body as a shield to
defend them.

201
00:16:48,783 --> 00:16:51,154
[struggling]

202
00:16:51,188 --> 00:16:57,868
I shall sing your praises
as a hero. So state your name
as compensation for your death.

203
00:16:57,902 --> 00:17:01,275
Compensation for... my
death...

204
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:04,180
One thing... Just promise
me...

205
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:05,951
Name it.

206
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:09,759
Leave my fellow samurai
alone!

207
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:12,430
That is all I ask.

208
00:17:17,407 --> 00:17:18,475
Uh!

209
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:23,753
Here's the antidote.

210
00:17:23,787 --> 00:17:25,791
[gasping]

211
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:30,066
I told you that one
cannot tell if someone
has conviction or not...
just by looking at them.

212
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:36,178
But sometimes one can
tell by fighting that
person. And you're a
rare one indeed.

213
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:42,390
I shall spare your life
today. Although... it's
true that you've taken in
so much poison, there's

214
00:17:42,423 --> 00:17:44,695
still a chance you may
die from it.

215
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,707
It is difficult to see
one's convictions
through.

216
00:17:51,943 --> 00:17:54,582
I, too, have my own
conviction...

217
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:02,330
...to find a way to
somehow bring peace to
this world.

218
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:07,875
I'll use you as a test
case, to see if you will
die still embracing your
convictions.

219
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:12,785
Or if you end up just
surviving and abandoning
those convictions over
time.

220
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:26,144
You insisted on testing
me back then. Have you
really abandoned all of
your convictions now?

221
00:18:32,223 --> 00:18:36,899
That is not something
that you can tell simply
by looking at someone,
I'm afraid.

222
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:38,168
Uh!

223
00:18:39,437 --> 00:18:42,143
There is still a way to
stop me even though I'm
immortal now.

224
00:18:42,176 --> 00:18:45,383
I told you before,
Mifune. Do you remember
it?

225
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:51,629
Stay back until the
opportunity presents
itself, and then seal me
away. You have done well.

226
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:52,965
<i>Lord Mifune!</i>

227
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,602
His poison!

228
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:58,275
No, it's fine, I'll be
all right. I have some
resistance to this
poison.

229
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:00,714
Although perhaps not at
this close a distance.

230
00:19:00,747 --> 00:19:05,757
Therefore, all of you
will retreat with me. And
then prepare to seal him.

231
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:10,299
<i>Now I can say for sure,</i>
<i>it was worth him surviving</i>
<i>that venom.</i>

232
00:19:13,573 --> 00:19:15,911
It's far enough.
We'll watch from here.

233
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:18,683
<i>Lord Hanzo.</i>

234
00:19:23,492 --> 00:19:25,864
Mifune, one final
thing...

235
00:19:30,006 --> 00:19:32,745
I entrust you with my
conviction!

236
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:40,594
Seppuku?! By a shinobi?!

237
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:49,979
He's disobeying the
orders embedded in my
tag?!

238
00:19:50,012 --> 00:19:54,555
He killed himself?! Time
to switch him to mindless
mode then.

239
00:19:55,824 --> 00:19:58,530
[struggling]

240
00:20:05,677 --> 00:20:06,713
Ugh!

241
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:08,883
Why's he not moving?

242
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:14,227
Lord Hanzo would never
stand for taking orders
not from someone who
hides in the shadows,

243
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,465
manipulating others like
they're puppets.

244
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:20,339
He fought off the person
controlling him and has
won his freedom.

245
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:27,588
If you remain true to
yourself and your convictions,
you'll show that you're not
just a blunted blade.

246
00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:29,090
Now seal him!

247
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:30,459
Yes, sir!

248
00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:46,224
So they sealed him,
huh...?

249
00:20:47,193 --> 00:20:48,395
[grunting]

250
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:58,716
I shall sing of your
praises and you'll live
on as a hero.

251
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:05,597
I hereby witness your
unwavering conviction.
Truly splendid, Lord
Hanzo!

252
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,576
<i>Lord Mifune?</i>

253
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:15,851
I've heard Lord Hanzo
doesn't have a proper
gravesite.

254
00:21:15,884 --> 00:21:20,694
And that means... We must
find a suitable place for
him to rest.

255
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:04,033
What are you doing,
Choji! I'm an enemy now,
accept it!

256
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:08,810
Your movements are slow,
Choji! Pull yourself
together! The three of
us prepared for this!

257
00:23:08,843 --> 00:23:13,987
<i>I'm sorry. This is way</i>
<i>too much for me! I can't</i>
<i>do it! I can't take our</i>
<i>Sensei down!</i>

258
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,624
I just can't!

259
00:23:15,657 --> 00:23:20,667
Next time on Naruto
Shippuden: True Kindness.

260
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,438
<i>Choji! Take me down, you</i>
<i>coward!</i>
