00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,205
NARUTO: Give Sasuke back.

2
00:00:19,238 --> 00:00:20,707
Give him back!

3
00:00:23,747 --> 00:00:24,215
Argh!

4
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:38,944
Don't you talk about
Sasuke like you own him!

5
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,083
Especially in front of
me, you rotten bastard!

[theme music]

7
00:03:02,728 --> 00:03:04,198
-How interesting.

8
00:04:16,073 --> 00:04:17,510
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): Chakra.

9
00:04:17,577 --> 00:04:20,516
He did all that with
just his chakra.

10
00:04:38,184 --> 00:04:38,651
-Sakura!

11
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,451
SAI (VOICEOVER): That
chakra is powerful.

12
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:16,961
It's almost like it's
acting on its own.

13
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:20,969
This is the perfect opportunity.

14
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:23,975
Time for my real
mission to begin.

15
00:05:29,853 --> 00:05:30,487
YAMATO: Sakura!

16
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:31,656
Can you hear me?

17
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:38,670
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): She must've
hit her head when she fell.

18
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:41,176
Of all the times
to get knocked out.

I can't hold it!

Super Beast Scroll.

-Sai!

Sai!

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,019
Get her!

26
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:35,650
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): Of all the--

27
00:07:46,524 --> 00:07:47,959
-Is that all you've got then?

28
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:57,178
Even with the power
of a Jinchuriki,

29
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:58,346
that's the best you can do?

30
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:30,878
You're no Sasuke.

31
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:33,215
You're not even in
the same league.

32
00:09:44,156 --> 00:09:46,761
-What is this place?

33
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:50,235
Where am I?

Sasuke!

Wait!

00:10:43,106 --> 00:10:43,840
Wait up!

Sasuke!

[heartbeat]

If only-- If only I'd
been stronger back then.

00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,744
-Sasuke!

46
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:57,387
I'm not letting
Orochimaru take you away!

47
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,357
Do you understand me?

48
00:11:59,391 --> 00:12:01,461
I'll break every single
bone in your body

49
00:12:01,528 --> 00:12:04,199
if that's what it
takes to stop you!

50
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:06,905
You're not going anywhere!

51
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:10,245
-You're still not gonna be able
to lay even a single scratch

52
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:12,416
on my forehead.

53
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:14,420
I know that hasn't
changed at least.

54
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,273
You're not leaving me a
lot of choice here, Naruto.

55
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,216
There's no question
that you're special.

56
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:38,735
Unfortunately, you're not
quite as special as I am.

57
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:40,672
Chidori.

58

-Chidori!

-Rasengan!

NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I'm too weak.

62
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:07,024
There's nothing I could ever
say that would reach him.

63
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:13,437
He'll never acknowledge
me the way I am now.

[heartbeat]

65
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:23,323
That's why I gotta do whatever
it takes to become stronger.

[heartbeats]

67
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:39,822
I can't let our friendship
have been for nothing.

[heartbeats]

69
00:13:44,832 --> 00:13:48,740
I won't let you break
that bond, Sasuke.

70
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:49,809
I won't allow it!

71
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,936
-Well, what do you know?

72
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,375
Something about this
feels different.

73
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:08,850
-Sakura.

74
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:09,752
Wake up.

75
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:10,587
Hey.

76
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:11,088
Sakura.

77
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,555
Are you all right?

78
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:28,489
-Yeah.

79
00:16:28,523 --> 00:16:29,458
I'm fine.

80
00:16:32,397 --> 00:16:34,802
-Sure?

81
00:16:34,802 --> 00:16:37,140
-Sorry.

82
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:38,910
I think I'm OK now.

83
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:54,074
What happened here?

84
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,808
-It was Naruto.

85
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:07,500
-It's no wonder
they're after him.

86
00:17:07,534 --> 00:17:11,542
The power of the
Jinchuriki's no joke.

87
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:13,177
-Where is he?

88
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:15,248
-He's on the other side already.

89
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:17,880
He went running off
after Orochimaru.

00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:38,628
SAI (VOICEOVER): Naruto
will be the tricky one here.

-What's the smoke?

92

YAMATO (VOICEOVER): I have
a bad feeling about this.

-Wood Clone Jutsu.

94

I'm counting on you.

Don't worry.

Domed Wall Jutsu.

SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:18,626
-The things this boy can do.

100
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:22,634
I must admit, he's
piqued my interest.

101
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,006
-Damn it.

[theme music]

103
00:21:59,811 --> 00:22:01,548
YAMATO: The force
of that shockwave.

104
00:22:01,615 --> 00:22:03,486
From just a single
blow of his hand.

105
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:05,022
It's incredible.

106
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,629
SAKURA: Is that-- Is that
the power of the Nine Tails?

107
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:09,564
YAMATO: That's right.

108
00:22:09,631 --> 00:22:10,800
SAKURA: Captain Yamato.

109
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,971
There's something you're
not telling me about Naruto,

110
00:22:13,004 --> 00:22:13,539
isn't there?

111
00:22:13,572 --> 00:22:14,140
YAMATO: Sakura.

112
00:22:14,174 --> 00:22:15,142
SAKURA: Please.

113
00:22:15,142 --> 00:22:16,945
What's going to happen to him?

114
00:22:16,945 --> 00:22:17,947
YAMATO: Don't worry.

115
00:22:17,947 --> 00:22:19,451
Naruto is going to be fine.

116
00:22:19,484 --> 00:22:21,989
It was exactly
for this situation

117
00:22:22,022 --> 00:22:24,394
that I was chosen
to lead this team.

118
00:22:24,461 --> 00:22:27,901
SAKURA: Next time,
Orochimaru Versus Jinchuriki.

119

[theme music]

120
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,598
NARUTO: The Hidden
Leaf Fitness Jam.

121
00:22:43,665 --> 00:22:47,206
Get ready for a taste of some
down home shinobi training.

122
00:22:47,239 --> 00:22:51,147
For step one, we'll move right
into some strength building!

123
00:22:51,147 --> 00:22:53,818
-Uh, if you wanna
be a great shinobi,

124
00:22:53,851 --> 00:22:57,025
then physical strength is key,
and no two training regimens

125
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:58,394
are alike.

126
00:22:58,428 --> 00:23:02,102
There are thumb stand push ups,
rock climbing, or doing laps

127
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:03,905
around the village
on your hands.

128
00:23:03,938 --> 00:23:04,907
Ugh.

129
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,844
I'm sweating just
watching all this.

130
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,514
And then there's step two!

131
00:23:08,548 --> 00:23:10,252
Tree climbing.

132
00:23:10,285 --> 00:23:12,389
-Gather all your chakra
at the soles of your feet

133
00:23:12,422 --> 00:23:13,223
and maintain it.

134
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:16,029
Step three!

135
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,100
SAKURA: Try to keep your
balance while you release

136
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:20,805
a steady stream of
chakra over some water.

137
00:23:20,872 --> 00:23:24,178
Get it wrong, spa-loosh!

138
00:23:24,178 --> 00:23:27,018
Sometimes I wonder how
we ever survived it all.

139
00:23:27,051 --> 00:23:29,609
But like they always
say, no pain, no gain.

140
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:30,515
Right?

141
00:23:30,515 --> 00:23:31,883
So listen all you folks at home.

142
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:32,917
-Yeah!

143
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,385
With hard work, even
you can be Hokage.

144
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:36,387
-It's dangerous stuff!

145
00:23:36,421 --> 00:23:39,334
So don't even think about
trying this at home, kids.
