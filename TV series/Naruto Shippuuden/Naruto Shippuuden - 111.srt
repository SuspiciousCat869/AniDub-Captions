‐I spy for you, huh?

31
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:27,594
Wouldn't it make more sense if I
were the one reporting directly

‐What are you saying?

34
00:04:32,498 --> 00:04:35,134
‐Just that I've done a
lot of undesirable tasks

35
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:36,069
under your command.

36

‐I alone serve Lord Orochimaru.

So everything's working out
just the way you planned, huh?

‐Yes.

41
00:04:49,182 --> 00:04:52,452
But of course, I'm not the
one who deserves the credit.

42
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:55,288
Everything has happened just
as Lord Orochimaru predicted

00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:56,757
it would.

44
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,434
He knew Guren and Yukimaru both
needed someone to belong to,

45
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,037
and so they'd form
a powerful bond.

46
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,472
And when the truth about
Guren was revealed,

47
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:09,776
this bond would be shattered,
and Yukimaru's anger

48
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,478
would unleash the
explosive force within him.

At least, it should have.

50
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,818
However, even when he
discovered that Guren

51
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,353
was the one responsible
for his mother's death,

52

You may be able to form

together in a solid structure,

169
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:35,435
Kill them all.

‐I've got to stop this thing.

171
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:05,506
Multi‐Shadow Clone Jutsu.

172
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:07,007
‐Yeah.

173
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,508
Yeah.

174
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,008
Come on.

175
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,324
‐My Rasengan won't
work against it.

176
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:28,494
And it isn't like I can use
the Wind Style Rasen Shuriken.

177
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,831
Damn.

178
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:32,799
There's only one option left.

179
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,239
Summoning Jutsu!

180
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:39,740
‐Huh.

181
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:46,680
‐Tell me that's not the
Three‐Tailed Beast, brother.

182
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,081
‐Hm.

183
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,551
It looks to me like things have
gotten a little bit out of hand

184
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:51,351
around here.

185
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,586
‐No kidding.

186
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,487
You think I would have
summoned you guys otherwise.

187
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:57,123
Gamatatsu, time for
the Toad Water Pistol.

188
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:57,824
‐Roger.

189
00:15:57,858 --> 00:15:58,324
‐Wait.

190
00:15:58,358 --> 00:15:59,392
Hold on.

191
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,060
‐Huh?

192
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,502
‐What are you doing?

193
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,636
We don't have time for‐‐

194
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,204
‐Use your head, will you?

195
00:16:04,237 --> 00:16:06,673
Your opponent's an
amphibious type beast

196
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:08,942
that lives in a lake
for crying out loud.

197
00:16:08,975 --> 00:16:11,645
No matter how much you
increase the strength,

198
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:14,781
a Water Style jutsu won't do
any good against a Water Style

199
00:16:14,815 --> 00:16:15,248
opponent.

200
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:16,583
‐Huh?

201
00:16:16,617 --> 00:16:18,952
GAMAKICHI: To beat a Water
Style you need an Earth Style.

202
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:28,595
‐Well, it will all be beside
the point if we don't hurry up.

203
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:33,800
We'll just have to hope my Wind
Style's enough to‐‐ hold on.

204
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:37,804
So then I'm a perfect
match for Sasuke.

205
00:16:37,838 --> 00:16:39,239
NARUTO: Well, yeah.

206
00:16:39,272 --> 00:16:40,941
Wind beats lightning certainly.

207
00:16:40,974 --> 00:16:42,375
‐No.

208
00:16:42,408 --> 00:16:45,011
That's not what I meant.

209
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:49,850
What I meant was that only my
wind can assist and magnifying

210
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,586
his fire.

211
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:53,119
Yeah.

212
00:16:53,153 --> 00:16:54,655
Fire Style.

213
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:56,389
‐What are you mumbling about?

214
00:16:56,422 --> 00:16:58,892
‐If only one of
us had Fire Style.

215
00:16:58,925 --> 00:17:00,534
‐Lucky for you, I do.

216
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:01,034
‐What?

217
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,002
You do?

218
00:17:02,035 --> 00:17:03,336
You've got it?

219
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:04,137
‐Fire Style.

220
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:04,838
Yeah.

221
00:17:04,871 --> 00:17:05,839
‐What's wrong with you?

222
00:17:05,872 --> 00:17:08,008
Why didn't you say so before?

223
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,010
‐Because you never asked me.

224
00:17:10,043 --> 00:17:12,178
So anyway, what about it.

225
00:17:12,212 --> 00:17:13,814
‐Well, with Fire Style we can‐‐

226
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:18,084
‐What is it now?

227
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:19,252
What's wrong?

228
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:20,353
‐Dammit.

229
00:17:20,386 --> 00:17:23,056
Well, so much for
that plan, I guess.

230
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,024
‐Spit it out.

231
00:17:24,057 --> 00:17:26,459
Stop mumbling to
yourself, will you?

232
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:28,895
‐I thought it might
work if we magnified

233
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:31,397
the power of your Fire
Style with my Wind Style,

234
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:36,503
but then I remembered, fire
is always weak against water.

235
00:17:36,537 --> 00:17:37,871
‐Hang on.

236
00:17:37,904 --> 00:17:39,105
Not always.

237
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:41,374
Not if we could find a way
to make the fire so intense

238
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:44,578
it would evaporate
any Water Style.

239
00:17:44,611 --> 00:17:45,946
Hey, Gamatatsu.

240
00:17:45,979 --> 00:17:48,114
‐What is it, brother?

241
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:50,216
‐Get on back to the
village and fill your belly

242
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,485
with all the toad
oil you can swallow.

243
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:53,186
One minute.

244
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:54,054
That's all you've got.

245
00:17:54,087 --> 00:17:55,589
Then we'll summon you back.

246
00:17:55,622 --> 00:17:56,890
Well, what are you waiting for?

247
00:17:56,923 --> 00:17:57,958
Get hopping.

248
00:17:57,991 --> 00:17:58,992
‐On my way.

249
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:04,771
‐I get it.

250
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:08,308
We use oil not water in
the Toad Water Pistol,

251
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:10,443
then squirt the
stuff all around.

252
00:18:10,476 --> 00:18:12,613
Then we set it on fire
with the Fire Style

253
00:18:12,646 --> 00:18:14,147
like a flame thrower.

254
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,551
‐The best part is, it's the
same as the Toad Water Pistol,

255
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:19,185
so we don't need practice.

256
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:20,654
We got it down.

257
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:21,387
‐Genius!

258
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:23,489
It's going to work.

259
00:18:23,524 --> 00:18:23,990
Yukimaru!

260
00:18:28,895 --> 00:18:32,265
Guren, I'm going to keep
the promise you made to him.

261
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:35,168
I'll give him a place
that he can call home.

262
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:35,969
‐That's it, Naruto.

263
00:18:36,002 --> 00:18:37,470
A minute's up.

264
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:38,304

‐Yeah.

268
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,814
I think so.

269
00:18:47,848 --> 00:18:49,783
‐Ready when you are, Naruto.

270
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:50,283
‐Gotcha.

271
00:18:56,022 --> 00:18:57,190
All right.

272
00:18:57,223 --> 00:18:59,826
Let's try this new
collaboration ninjutsu.

273
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,201
Aim for its eye.

274
00:19:01,234 --> 00:19:02,368
That's its weak spot.

275
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,012
So are we ready to do this?

276
00:19:12,045 --> 00:19:13,814
‐Make the first shot
a bullseye, because we

‐Understood.

00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:21,755
‐Right.

280
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:22,689
Gamatatsu.

281
00:19:22,723 --> 00:19:23,189
‐OK.

282
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:27,327
‐Collaboration Ninjutsu!

283

Way to go, brother!

‐Yeah, you weren't bad either.

‐Looks like it's over for
the time being at least.

‐I guess that means
we're done here.

‐Yeah.

292
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:27,393
Thanks.

Yukimaru, come on.
