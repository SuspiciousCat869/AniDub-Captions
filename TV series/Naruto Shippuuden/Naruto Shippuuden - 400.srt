1
00:01:53,726 --> 00:01:58,228
{\an1}<i>Shira has almost no skill at</i>
<i>all for ninjutsu or genjutsu.</i>

2
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:01,731
{\an1}Shira and I are alike...

3
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:06,032
{\an1}<i>We are shinobi who can</i>
<i>only perform taijutsu.</i>

4
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:07,600
[gasps]

5
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:10,435
{\an1}I see...so you already knew
that.

6
00:02:14,237 --> 00:02:17,105
{\an1}<i>I realized it yesterday when we</i>

[wham]

00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:26,176
{\an1}Those skilled with ninjutsu and
genjutsu may not notice the
slight difference.

9
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:30,113
{\an1}And yet it is unique, so I
sensed that he was just like me.

10
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:33,281
{\an1}<i>Since you already know that</i>
<i>much, I'll explain. </i>

11
00:02:34,115 --> 00:02:39,285
{\an1}In the Hidden Sand, not even
the previous Kazekage would
allow people who are like Shira

12
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:40,218
{\an1}to become shinobi.

13
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,754
{\an1}<i>But that is--! Even a great</i>
<i>taijutsu user like Shira?! </i>

14
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:54,159
{\an4}<i>Yes, it's true. That's why until</i>
<i>recently, Shira wasn't allowed</i>
<i>to attend the Academy and was</i>
<i>treated like an outsider.</i>

15
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:56,427

Go learn some ninjutsu!

18
00:03:03,997 --> 00:03:08,267
{\an1}Just go away! In case your
stupidity is contagious!

19
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:11,101
{\an1}Take that you loser! [laughing]

20

{\an1}Yeah, that's right! You'd better
get out of here-while you still
can! [laughing]

21
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:20,573
{\an1}<i>But Shira refused to give up. </i>
<i>He kept on believing in himself.</i>

00:03:47,388 --> 00:03:49,222
{\an1}<i>Then, the times changed...</i>

26
00:03:51,758 --> 00:03:56,894
{\an4}<i>The seat was empty for a while</i>
<i>after the Fourth Kazekage passed</i>

<i>became the Fifth Kazekage.</i>

27
00:03:58,227 --> 00:04:04,131
{\an1}<i>Those who knew about Lord</i>
<i>Gaara's dark past spread rumors</i>

28
00:04:04,165 --> 00:04:06,899
{\an1}<i>but in fact, it was just</i>
<i>the opposite.</i>

29
00:04:07,132 --> 00:04:10,101
{\an1}<i>Lord Gaara was receptive to</i>
<i>people's opinions. </i>

30
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:17,205
{\an4}<i>One by one, he did away with </i>
<i>the previous Kazekage's</i>
<i>practices and instituted</i>
<i>reforms.</i>

31
00:04:20,374 --> 00:04:21,741
{\an1}Is that Lord Gaara?

32
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:26,876
{\an1}That's right. He's the younger
brother of Temari. We used to
play with her as kids.

33
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:39,651
{\an1}What happened to the big
boulder that was being used to
prevent sand erosion?

34
00:04:39,684 --> 00:04:42,219
{\an1}Oh...Well, you see...

35
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:54,592
{\an1}Bring me the one who destroyed
this.

36
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:02,263
Are you Shira?

37
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:08,567
{\an1}You knew that that boulder was
there to protect the Sand.
Why did you destroy it?

38
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,067
{\an1}I'm very sorry, sir.

39
00:05:10,835 --> 00:05:12,569
{\an1}I didn't intend to destroy it.

40
00:05:13,837 --> 00:05:17,705
{\an1}Because to me...that boulder
was an invaluable training
partner.

41
00:05:18,306 --> 00:05:20,407
{\an1}Wait, you destroyed it through
training?

42
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:24,175
{\an1}I was told that you aren't a
student at the Academy.

43
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:25,844
No...

44
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:29,545
{\an1}I don't have any skill with
ninjutsu or genjutsu.

45
00:05:30,545 --> 00:05:36,048
{\an4}According to our village's
rules, somebody who's like me is
completely unfit to become a
shinobi.

46
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:41,418
{\an1}So instead, you trained all by
yourself, is that right?

47
00:05:41,451 --> 00:05:42,352
Interesting...

48
00:05:42,386 --> 00:05:49,022
[gasp, thudding]

49
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:58,128
{\an1}I wanna know which one's more
valuable to the village.
Is it the boulder or you?

50
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:15,404
[yell, pow]

51

{\an1}<i>Please forgive me, sir!</i>

53
00:06:28,377 --> 00:06:31,880
{\an1}I can't imagine the effort it
took, banned from the Academy...

54
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:35,248
{\an1}...to refine your skills to
such a high level.

55
00:06:36,182 --> 00:06:42,185
{\an1}<i>I hereby abolish my</i>

56

[gasps]

57
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:51,290
{\an4}I've met someone like you.
He's a shinobi that comes
from the Village Hidden in the
Leaves.

58
00:06:52,257 --> 00:06:54,159
[yell]

65
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:15,003

I think you will be as
impressive a shinobi as he is.

66
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,408
{\an1}So that's how Shira was finally
able to become a shinobi.

67
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:27,877
{\an1}Not only that, but Lord Gaara
recognized Shira's character...

68
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:30,679
{\an1}...and chose him to become his
taijutsu coach.

69
00:07:30,978 --> 00:07:34,614
{\an1}To be named the Kazekage's coach
is a huge honor!

70
00:07:34,815 --> 00:07:38,917
{\an1}Although...Gaara's decisions
displeased many people in the
Sand.

[gasp]

attains great and unexpected
success,

73
00:07:45,387 --> 00:07:47,488
{\an1}people can become jealous...

74
00:07:47,521 --> 00:07:52,458

Changing people's perceptions
can take a lot of time.

76
00:07:54,358 --> 00:07:56,326
{\an1}That is why Shira said that to
me...

77
00:07:57,761 --> 00:07:59,762
{\an1}I don't know what you sensed
back there, but...

78
00:08:00,462 --> 00:08:02,963
{\an1}...dwelling on the misfortunes
of birth is meaningless.

79
00:08:03,464 --> 00:08:07,833
{\an1}Despite all of the flaws and
suffering, we have just one
life, this one.

himself forward. Despite what

{\an1}Oh, no, Lee...Man, here we go

No way!

279
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,592
{\an1}Please listen! I really wanna
fight you, Shira!

280
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:05,229
{\an1}[exhale] Because we both seek
to master taijutsu,
will you please fight me!

281
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:10,531
{\an1}If I face you in battle, then I
will have absolutely no regrets
from these Chunin Exams!

282
00:21:11,032 --> 00:21:13,432
{\an1}All right. That's fine by me,
Lee.

283
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:16,935
{\an1}To be completely honest, I've
wanted to fight you, as well!

284
00:22:58,224 --> 00:23:00,893
{\an1}<i>Shira, I will show you how</i>
<i>serious I am! </i>

285
00:23:01,393 --> 00:23:03,394
{\an1}<i>This is going to be my last</i>
<i>fight. </i>

286
00:23:03,894 --> 00:23:04,728
<i>Last fight...?</i>

287
00:23:06,562 --> 00:23:08,530
{\an1}<i>Lee, it's all because of you</i>
<i>that I can be a shinobi. I'm</i>
<i>grateful to you.</i>

288
00:23:09,531 --> 00:23:12,532
{\an1}<i>It might have been your fists</i>
<i>that changed Lord Gaara. </i>

289
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:19,303
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>"The Ultimate." </i>

290
00:23:19,337 --> 00:23:22,339
{\an1}<i>I'll show you my gratitude in</i>
<i>earnest! </i>
