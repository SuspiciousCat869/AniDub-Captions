1
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,654
-Why save someone who
doesn't respect you?

2
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:27,227
Why stand up to the
likes of Orochimaru?

3
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:32,002
Why risk your life for someone
who doesn't want to be saved?

4
00:00:33,763 --> 00:00:38,134
Why would you when no one is
even ordering you to do so?

5
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:52,415
-Sasuke is my best friend.

6
00:00:52,415 --> 00:00:57,721
It took a while, but now
we have a special bond.

7
00:00:57,754 --> 00:01:01,324
-A bond?

8
00:01:01,357 --> 00:01:03,927
You may have a bond,
but you'll still

9
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,729
have to battle Orochimaru.

10
00:01:05,762 --> 00:01:06,830
-Don't you get it?

11
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,433
It doesn't matter how
strong my opponent is.

12
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:12,235
If he tears off my arms.

13
00:01:12,268 --> 00:01:14,404
I'll just kick him dead.

14
00:01:14,437 --> 00:01:18,141
If he tears off my legs,
I'll bite him dead.

15
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:22,278
If he tears off my head,
I'll stare him dead.

16
00:01:22,312 --> 00:01:25,615
If he gouges out my eyes,
I'll curse him dead.

17
00:01:32,288 --> 00:01:35,158
Even if I get
chopped into pieces,

18
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:38,294
I'm going to beat Orochimaru
and take my friend

19
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:41,364
Sasuke back once and for all.

20
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:43,666
[theme music]

21
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:51,327
-We'll get going after
I create a lookout.

22
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,884
-My, my.

23
00:04:14,918 --> 00:04:16,719
I thought we'd given
you people the slip.

24
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:23,459
But you were one of Lord
Orochimaru's experiments.

25
00:04:23,493 --> 00:04:25,328
I guess I should've
expected as much.

26
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:30,266
Huh.

27
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,240
-Kabuto, you-- You
just don't quit.

28
00:04:40,143 --> 00:04:42,312
-Sai.

29
00:04:42,312 --> 00:04:44,847
Judging from the
circumstances, it

30
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:48,751
appears that they've
taken you captive.

31
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:51,354
-Stay out of this.

32
00:04:51,387 --> 00:04:55,191
If you try to interfere,
I won't go easy on you.

33
00:05:15,845 --> 00:05:17,313
-That's pointless.

34
00:05:17,347 --> 00:05:19,749
-It may be pointless,
but we won't

35
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:21,718
know unless we give it a shot.

36
00:05:25,722 --> 00:05:31,294
We've come way too far to
let you get in our way.

37
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:32,295
-No, no.

38
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,177
That's not what I
was talking about.

39
00:06:38,694 --> 00:06:39,762
That was pretty impressive.

40
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,872
KABUTO (VOICEOVER):
With three against one,

41
00:07:22,905 --> 00:07:25,174
the odds are stacked against me.

42
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:30,713
And they seem to have
luck on their side too.

43
00:07:38,855 --> 00:07:42,825
-Well, it doesn't look like you
betrayed us, Sai, so I still

44
00:07:42,859 --> 00:07:43,626
trust you.

45
00:07:47,864 --> 00:07:51,834
I must say, watching you people
fight, it's truly pathetic.

46
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:02,211
Especially you, Naruto.

47
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:04,147
You're the most
pathetic one of all.

48
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:11,187
What I meant was even if
you did manage to beat me,

49
00:08:11,187 --> 00:08:12,922
it's pointless.

50
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:13,890
People change.

51
00:08:18,594 --> 00:08:23,533
Sasuke is no longer the
boy you knew long ago.

52
00:08:42,218 --> 00:08:42,585
Sai.

53
00:08:48,724 --> 00:08:49,926
What do you think you're doing?

54
00:08:54,564 --> 00:08:56,432
-It's funny.

55
00:08:56,432 --> 00:09:00,203
There was a time when I
really hated Sasuke's guts.

56
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:02,638
But when I look
back, I gotta admit,

57
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:05,608
it was always fun
being around the guy.

58
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:10,713
I mean, after all--
after all, Sasuke's

59
00:09:10,713 --> 00:09:13,482
the person who accepted
me more than anybody else.

60
00:09:17,286 --> 00:09:20,590
Sasuke is my best friend.

61
00:09:20,623 --> 00:09:24,927
It took a while, but now
we have a special bond.

62
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:27,196
KABUTO: You have a mission.

63
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,433
You're a liaison between
Danzo and Lord Orochimaru.

64
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:32,635
What's the meaning of this?

65
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:45,648
SAI: If people can
change, then so can I.

66
00:09:45,681 --> 00:09:47,750
-What?

67
00:09:47,783 --> 00:09:51,487
SAI: But there are also some
things that don't change.

68
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,189
-Sai.

69
00:09:53,222 --> 00:09:53,856
You mean--

70
00:09:59,262 --> 00:10:00,196
-That bond.

71
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:04,867
Show me.

72
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,435
I want to see it for myself.

73
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:12,208
-Sai.

74
00:10:15,578 --> 00:10:17,446
-Sai, keep a tight hold on him.

75
00:10:47,176 --> 00:10:51,347
-Look, Sai, I hope you
know what you're doing.

76
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,582
-I'm curious about this
bond you and Sasuke

77
00:10:53,582 --> 00:10:56,352
share that keeps
you going after him.

78
00:10:56,385 --> 00:10:59,689
I can't say I know
what it means,

79
00:10:59,722 --> 00:11:02,665
but I want to understand it.

80
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,919
Just by watching
the two of you, I

81
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:12,756
realize I haven't been able to
erase the bond with my brother.

82
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,759
-You can't bear to part with
it because it means something

83
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,760
to you.

84
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:18,962
It means you're somebody's
younger brother,

85
00:11:18,995 --> 00:11:22,165
and you don't want
to forget that.

86
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:23,900
He was your family.

87
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,902
The bond you shared
with your older brother

88
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:30,173
must be incredibly
important to you.

89
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:32,942
Losing that book means
erasing that bond,

90
00:11:32,976 --> 00:11:34,911
and you don't want
that to happen.

91
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:44,187
-A-- a bond we shared?

92
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,494
If that really is such
an important thing to me,

93
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:54,864
perhaps I can figure
out why by observing

94
00:11:54,898 --> 00:11:58,101
the bond between you and Sasuke.

95
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,769
That's all I was thinking.

96
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:07,577
[laughs]

97
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,781
-Hey, what's so funny?

98
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,951
-You people obviously
don't know the real Sasuke.

99
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:38,508
-All right.

100
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,208
Tell us where he is.

101
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:50,228
Come on.

102
00:12:50,262 --> 00:12:51,193
Out with it.

103
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:11,206
-By now, he's probably
finished training

104
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,444
and retired to one
of the inner rooms.

105
00:13:15,477 --> 00:13:17,046
-That could be true.

106
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:20,115
Sasuke began training
with Orochimaru.

107
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:22,818
There's no reason to
believe he's lying to us.

108
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:23,452
-All right.

109
00:13:23,485 --> 00:13:25,054
Then let's get going.

110
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:28,257
-However, inner room
is somewhat vague.

111
00:13:30,926 --> 00:13:33,762
-Even I don't know
exactly where it is.

112
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:35,931
The inner recesses
of this place are

113
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:38,100
riddled with isolated rooms.

114
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:41,437
We're not just talking
about one or two.

115
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,339
-Well, if that's
the case, we'll just

116
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:48,410
have to search
every one of them.

117
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:50,079
-Sure.

118
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:51,880
There's always a chance
you might stumble

119
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,348
upon it if you search at random.

120
00:13:56,018 --> 00:14:00,355
However, if you aren't
careful where you look,

121
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:02,891
you might accidentally
stir up a hornet's nest.

122
00:14:15,037 --> 00:14:17,072
Lord Orochimaru's
private quarters

123
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,340
are located there as well.

124
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,995
-Well, thank you for being
so straightforward with us.

125
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:41,330
-Oh, no.

126
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,765
You shouldn't be thanking me.

127
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,201
-Wh-- why shouldn't we?

128
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:49,071
You don't think we're
going to make it out?

129
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:50,372
-Nope.

130
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:53,075
-Why you--

131
00:14:53,108 --> 00:14:56,945
-I guess we won't know that
unless we give it a shot.

132
00:14:56,945 --> 00:14:57,513
Let's go.

133
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:10,759
-Won't know until
you give it a shot.

134
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:11,160
Huh.

135
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,471
Huh.

136
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,338
How pathetic.

137
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:51,200
-OK.

138
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:54,036
Let's split up into
two teams here.

139
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:57,005
Sakura and myself,
you two on the other.

140
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,330
-Whatever it takes.

141
00:16:11,477 --> 00:16:14,012
-Anything happens,
infuse your chakra.

142
00:16:14,046 --> 00:16:15,447
I'll come to you
as soon as I can.

143
00:16:25,324 --> 00:16:27,626
-Sasuke.

144
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:29,628
YAMATO: All right.

145
00:16:29,628 --> 00:16:30,629
Move out.

146
00:16:38,103 --> 00:16:41,006
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Just hang on, Sasuke.

147
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,208
I swear, I'm on my way.

148
00:16:55,888 --> 00:16:56,255
-Here.

149
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,942
You should see the
look on your face.

150
00:17:19,511 --> 00:17:22,915
You-- you look
like a total loser.

151
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:29,421
-Man, you don't
know when to quit.

152
00:17:29,455 --> 00:17:31,490
What are you biting her
head off for, you idiot?

153
00:17:31,523 --> 00:17:33,091
It's just cause she
cares about you.

154
00:17:33,091 --> 00:17:34,092
-Naruto.

155
00:17:34,092 --> 00:17:36,094
-Huh?

156
00:17:36,128 --> 00:17:39,498
-You're one of the ones
I want to fight the most.

157
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:40,098
-Huh?

158
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:55,914
SASUKE: One thing is
worthwhile-- our friendship.

159
00:18:00,285 --> 00:18:02,221
We became the best of friends.

160
00:18:06,024 --> 00:18:07,092
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sasuke.

161
00:18:17,102 --> 00:18:18,183
-Sakura.

162
00:18:23,773 --> 00:18:25,308
Thank you for everything.

163
00:18:29,012 --> 00:18:31,104
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Sasuke.

164
00:18:36,303 --> 00:18:37,471
YAMATO: Naruto.

165
00:18:37,505 --> 00:18:39,044
NARUTO: I see it.

166
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,292
YAMATO: It looks
like no one's here.

167
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,440
SAKURA: Not here.

168
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,748
-This one's empty too.

169
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,416
-He's not in this one either.

170
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,287
-Wrong one.

171
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,290
-Empty.

172
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,291
-Damn it.

173
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:29,602
-Sasuke, where could you be?

174
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:33,606
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Where?

175
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:41,581
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): We've come
so far after all this time.

176
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:44,450
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Where are you?

177
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:45,551
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Sasuke.

178
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:04,871
-Sasuke!

179
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,931

180
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:01,854
YAMATO: Naruto,
remember we've got

181
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:03,790
two teams searching for him.

182
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:04,824
You should rest a little.

183
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,426
NARUTO: I can't
take a break now.

184
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,561
We're this close
to finding Sasuke.

185
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,730
I know it.

186
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,468
YAMATO: Naruto, you are loud
mouthed, impatient, unrefined.

187
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,702
NARUTO: Mind your own business.

188
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,839
YAMATO: I must say, you
really are like him.

189
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,740
NARUTO: Huh?

190
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:21,841
Like who?

191
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,609
-My older brother.

192
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:27,914
NARUTO: Next time, "The
Picture Book's Story."

194
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:43,496
YAMATO: And now, "Leaf
Crossing Super Quiz, Part Two."

195
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,399
Let's get started with
today's fabulous contestants.

196
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:48,301
-I bet know all the answers.

197
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:50,870
-No one's gonna beat me.

198
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:52,205
-Then let's play.

199
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:55,541
Here comes the Chunin
Exam buzz in quiz.

200
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,710
In the first Chunin
Exam, the person

201
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,712
who served as Exam
proctor was a master

202
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,280
of torture and interrogation.

203
00:23:01,314 --> 00:23:03,416
-Ibiki Morino.

204
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:04,750
YAMATO: Ah, not finished yet.

205
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:07,420
The second Exam proctor
for the scroll competition

206
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:10,289
in the forest of death
had a super sweet tooth.

207
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:11,891
-Anko Mitarashi.

208
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,460
YAMATO: But the question
is, at the Chunin Exams,

209
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,896
who were the three sound
ninja that received orders

210
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:17,730
from Orochimaru?

211
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,332
-Oh, yeah, I remember them.

212
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:20,466
What were their names again?

213
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,767
-I Have no idea.

214
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:22,735
-Time's up.

215
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:25,338
We're looking for
Dosu, Zaku, and Kin.

216
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:26,772
-Sai, you're correct.

217
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:29,942
And for the record, after
that, Dosu fell prey to Gaara,

218
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:32,745
while tragically, Zaku
and Kin were sacrificed

219
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,214
for Orochimaru's reanimation.

220
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,316
-So would this be a proper
time for me to smile?

221
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,452
-Don't you dare!
