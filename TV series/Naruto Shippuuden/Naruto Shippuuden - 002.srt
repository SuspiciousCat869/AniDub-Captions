happened, but I've

even taken it a step further.

168
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:24,170
Well, I'm not about
to be outdone by him.

169
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:24,704
-Mm?

170
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,277
-I'm still gonna
be Hokage one day.

171
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,645
Just you wait, Gaara!

172
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:40,186
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Funny, I
think he has grown up a bit.

173
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,831
JIRAIYA: What do you think?

174
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,033
Not bad, huh?

175
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,972
If you ask me, it's the
best one I've ever written.

176
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,140
[chuckling]

177
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,618
-I'm delivering Naruto into
your hands as promised.

178
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:15,755
-I can see he's grown all
right, but has he grown up?

179
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:19,125
-Huh, you implying I
haven't done my job?

180
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,361
Oh, go ahead, underestimate him.

181
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,529
You'll be sorry.

182
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,865
-Well, that sounds encouraging.

183
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,735
-The ones we've been watching
are about to make their move.

184
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,608
-Over the last few
years, our village

185
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:39,079
has enjoyed stability and
prosperity, largely due

186
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:43,383
to our dealings with the Hidden
Villages of the Allied Lands.

187
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,319
To give one example
of this, our recruits

188
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,155
are better trained thanks
to new training methods,

189
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,057
methods learned from
the Leaf Village.

190
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,593
-We'll see how much
better they are.

191
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,162
The chunin exams
are almost upon us.

192
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,530
-Correct.

193
00:09:57,564 --> 00:10:00,166
And that's why these nasty
rumors are specially troubling

194
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,601
right now.

195
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,170
-Rumors, Yura?

196
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,505
-Yes, sir.

197
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,074
Have you ever heard of a
group called the Akatsuki?

198
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,186
-I see.

199
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,722
So they're finally coming
out of the woodwork.

200
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,190
-It's no surprise.

201
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,960
Bound to happen sooner or later.

202
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:30,096
-The Akatsuki.

203
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,299
-The Akatsuki is a
mysterious organization

204
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,569
comprised of a
dozen or so shinobi.

205
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:39,839
Every one of its members is
listed in the "Bingo Book"

206
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,842
as ruthless S-rank criminals.

207
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,811
Of those who have
been identified,

208
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,547
one is Itachi Uchiha
of the Village Hidden

209
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,083
in the Leaves, a
man who annihilated

210
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:53,319
his own clan in a single night.

211
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:57,557
Another is Kisame Hoshigaki, one
of the seven ninja swordsmen,

212
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,093
the Phantom of the Mist Village.

213
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:03,997
Then there's Orochimaru, the
assassin of our late Kazekage,

214
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,499
who came so close to
destroying the Leaf.

215
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,836
It is said that even he
too was once a member.

216
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:18,077
-So why do you think they're
finally showing their hand?

217
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,079
What are they after?

218
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,515
-There ultimate objective
is still unclear,

219
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:30,190
but I know one thing-- they
want the fox spirit that Naruto

220
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,058
carries within himself.

221
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,227
As to why-- well,
you can be sure

222
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,564
they have some evil
purpose in mind.

223
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,365
That's why I've been
going around spreading

224
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,367
the word to all our allies.

225
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,903
Something's coming, so they'd
better boost their security

226
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,171
and keep on their toes.

227
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,481
-I see.

228
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:58,818
Yes, I've heard something
of this myself recently.

229
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,821
So they're finally
making their move.

230
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:05,258
-We have this information from
one of the legendary Sannin,

231
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,360
Master Jiraiya himself.

232
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,262
So before this
meeting was convened,

233
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,265
I took the liberty of ordering
the village to be secured

234
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,968
and I've stationed ANBU
Black Ops at key points

235
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,337
on the perimeter.

236
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,173
No matter how clever
these shinobi may be,

237
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:24,210
if they hope to take us by
surprise, they're mistaken.

238
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,813
We've heard that they often
wear distinctive black cloaks

239
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:30,250
emblazoned with red clouds.

240
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,752
If our lookouts
spot such a cloak,

241
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,121
they've been ordered by
me to attack at once.

242
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,424
[murmuring]

243
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,459
BAKI: Very well, then.

244
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:40,526
This meeting is adjourned.

245
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,438
-Well done, Yura.

246
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,741
We're all impressed by the
promptness and prudence

247
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,009
of your actions.

248
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,210
-Hm.

249
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,579
Well, I have had a seat
on the Council of Advisors

250
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,515
for four years, and I've
learned that I must--

251
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:03,716
[grunt]

252
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,518
-(STRAINED) --be able to
make decisions on my own--

253
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,853
-Huh?

254
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,622
-(STRAINED) --while always
considering the best interests

255
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:10,223
of the village.

256
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:22,001
[grunt]

257
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,369
-What's wrong?

258
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:24,304
-Nothing!

259
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:25,471
It's nothing.

260
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:28,141
I'm just tired, that's all.

261
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,275
-Careful.

262
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,678
You push yourself too hard.

263
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:33,880
-Thank you for your concern.

264
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,349
[groaning]

265
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,350
YURA (VOICEOVER): I see.

266
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,319
So that's what's--

267
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:42,789
[bell jingling]

268
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,568
-The one who's in place here
will be the first, it seems.

269
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,838
The one we sent to
Orochimaru will have to wait.

270
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,573
This one's turned
traitor and has

271
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,842
been talking about
our movements.

272
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:03,776
Hmm.

273
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,079
-Can't be helped, I suppose.

274
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:10,383
But even I don't know what will
happen once the jutsu is cast.

275
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:14,020
Are you sure what you've got
in that pouch will be enough?

276
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:17,824
Our enemy possesses
the jinchuuriki host.

277
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,828
-Every one of my jutsu
is a work of art.

278
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,531
But just to be sure, I brought
along of my masterpiece.

279
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:26,032
Hmm.

280
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:33,373
We can't take any chances when
our opponent is the One-Tail.

281
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,774
[chuckling]

282
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,231
-Oh, come on!

283
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,701
Is Kakashi-sensei gonna keep
us waiting here forever?

284
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,570
-Well, he's always
been like this.

285
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:08,374
-Yeah, I know, but I thought
he would have grown up by now.

286
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,809
[chuckling]

287
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:10,743
-Huh?

288
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,211
-Sorry to keep you waiting.

289
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,880
I, uh, ran into
this poor old lady

290
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,181
who needed help carrying some--

291
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,049
-(IN UNISON) Would
you give us a break?

292
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:26,659
-Oh wow, does this
bring back memories.

293
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,500
-Your assignment is very simple.

294
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,502
You just have to take
these bells from me.

295
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:37,770
That's all there is to it.

296
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,273
If you can't get 'em by
noon, you go without lunch.

297
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,340
-Waa!

298
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:42,842
-You'll be tied to
those posts and you'll

299
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,311
watch while I eat my
lunch in front of you.

[bells jingling]

301
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,251
-Oh, that's right.

302
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,954
This was the site of your
very first training lesson,

303
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,390
wasn't it?

304
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,326
-It was Squad 7.

305
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:03,362
-The three of us together.

306
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:04,730
-That's right.

307
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:07,233
We had Sasuke with us
back then, didn't we?

308
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,907
-Don't leave me!

309
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:17,810
If you go, I'll scream and--

310
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:22,048
-Sakura.

311
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,921
Thank you for everything.

314
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,230
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Sasuke.

315
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:44,070
-Sasuke!

316
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,082
-So it's you.

317
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,185
Hopeless little knucklehead.

-Huh.

-Hmm?

-Remember that
time with Sasuke--

I guess Sasuke's name

323
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,896
is taboo to these guys.
