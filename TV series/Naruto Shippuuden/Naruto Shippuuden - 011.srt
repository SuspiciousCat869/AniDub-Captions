-Ah!

00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,829
-What do you think you're
doing, attacking Kakashi Sensei

7
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:32,399
like that, you
wrinkly old prune?

(THINKING) She may be
old, but she's good.

-I haven't forgotten
what you did.

10
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:43,377
I've waited for this day
White Fang of the leaf,

11
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,447
the day I wreak vengeance on
you for what you did to my son.

12
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:48,348
-No, no, no.

You see, I'm not--

-That's enough talk.

at the man, sis.

LORD EBIZO: It's true
there's a resemblance.

19
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,132
But this one is
not the White Fang.

LORD EBIZO: Besides,
as you know,

the White Fang of the

When you heard the news,
you wept in frustration.

27
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:23,717
Because it meant you would
never have your vengeance.

28
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,154
Isn't that so, sis?

29

-Yes, please.

if you all clear out,

37
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:50,877

-We're definitely dealing with
a heavy metal based toxin,

47
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,745
the kind that attacks
muscle tissue,

48
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,082
destroying the cells' integrity.

all that in one look?

SAKURA: May I see his chart?

-Yes, of course.

Here it is.

We were getting a
breakdown of the poison.

00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,061
But there are still
quite a few blanks.

-I know just what will happen.

56
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,533
The cardiac muscle
will be weakened

57
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,334
to the point where the
heart will collapse,

58
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,303
and cease functioning
altogether.

It's doubtful we'll
be able to come up

There's nothing you can do?

and I'll need them quickly.

-Right.

00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,218
SAKURA: This is going
to be pretty crude.

66
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:22,122
But it's the only
option we have.

put together an antidote

that you have in this village.

in our village like this?

-Well, after all, Lady
Tsunade is my teacher.

135
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,402
And it was by her order
that I personally came here.

136
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,541
-Here's that list
of medicinal herbs.

137

-Good.

that the river of time

It's Takemaru.

00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,605
He's back.

from the leaf village.

It's from your Hokage.

-From Grandma Tsunade?

147
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:26,019
What did she say?

148
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:32,592
-She says that Team Guy is on
its way here to back us up.

[laughing] I can't wait to see
how much they've all changed.

152
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:55,915
I hear even Neji's
been made a jonin.

153
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,617
Well, all right.

154
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,186
No sense waiting around
for them to get here.

155
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,722
Let's go after the
Akatsuki right now.

156
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,691
-OK, but which
way are you going?

157
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,659
Do you even know where they are?

158
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:10,496
-Uh no.

159
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,799
-If you don't mind
my asking, what

160
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,734
have been the results
so far of your attempts

161
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:15,902
to pursue the Akatsuki?

162
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,941
-First, Kankuro went
after them by himself.

163
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,376
And you see what
happened to him.

164
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,881
Then we dispatched a
tracking unit in pursuit.

165
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,551
But as yet, we haven't
heard back from them.

00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,586
And there's another problem.

167
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,423
We believe that-- well, it
appears the Captain Yura,

168
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,360
one of our council of
advisers has gone missing.

169
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:43,830
We don't even know
if he's alive.

170
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,365
-So you're saying
you've completely

171
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,967
lost track of the Akatsuki?

172
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,002
-Yes.

173
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,136
We have.

174
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:53,373
-Lord Baki, Kankuro has
regained consciousness.

175
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:04,550
-Kankuro, are you all right?

176
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:08,488
-Temari, you're back already.

177
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,057
-I heard the village
was in trouble.

178
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,793
-I'm sorry to be such a bother.

179
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:14,694
-Shut up.

180
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,362
Don't be ridiculous.

181
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,131
-Can you lead me to
where Kankuro's fight

182
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,633
with the Akatsuki took place?

183
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,436
-I'm known for having a
pretty good nose for tracking.

184
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,371
If even the slightest
trace of their scent

185
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,806
remains on the scene--

186
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,241
KANKURO: There's
no need for that.

187
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,214
Where are my puppets?

188
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:38,017
I assume that my puppets
were recovered, right?

189
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,004
-I never imagined I'd
find such a wide variety

190
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:01,341
of medicinal herbs here
in the hidden sand.

191
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,042
-Well, we try.

192
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,645
Our soil's not very well
suited to growing them.

193
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,781
We can't grow much scurvy
grass, for example.

194
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:09,849
SAKURA: That's all right.

195
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,384
There's enough.

196
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,019
I can make three
doses of antidote.

197
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:21,094
-One fought with me, while
the other carried Gaara away.

198
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,596
You might be able to
follow Gaara's scent.

199
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,632
But you can definitely
track the one I fought.

200
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,202
I made sure of it.

201
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,104
You see, I've got
his scent right here.

202
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,313
The last thing I
did was make sure I

203
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,748
got a scrap of his clothing.

204
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:49,255
-Even in defeat, you
went down fighting.

205
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:53,259
Just what I'd expect
from a Sand Shinobi.

-Is that you, Naruto?

Long time no see.

Look at you.

You haven't changed a bit.

-You haven't either.

What are you talking about.

I'm a lot taller, for one thing.

-All right.

227

All right.

Let's skip the reunion.

I need you guys to get
on this right away.

-Find out which way he went, OK?

232
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:01,227
Go on.

233
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,962
-Well let you know
when we find something.

234
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,533
-They won't let us down.

235
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:16,709
OK, we move out as soon as
Pakkun and his posse get back.

236
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,678
So I say we start getting ready.

-Not so fast, Naruto.

Lady Chiyo and Lord
Abizo, you're here?

-There's something we must
know, and only you can tell us.

243
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,462
Am I correct in thinking
that one of your opponents,

244
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,231
the one you fought
with, was Sasori?

245

-Well, speak up, Kankuro.

246
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,075
-Yes, Sasori of the red sand.

247
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,476
He told me so himself.

248
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,552
-Sasori of the red sand, huh?

249
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:03,756
I get the feeling you know
something about these Akatsuki.

250
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,391
Will you tell us?

You should be all right now.

And don't move around
until the numbness passes.

I think I finally
understand the suffering

He's the whole reason
my eyes have opened.

for defense,

and the Black Ant for capturing
and securing opponents.

00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,427
it means curtains for somebody.

328
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:16,962
TEMARI: Yeah, they're
effective, even

329
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:19,031
if they are a little creepy.

330
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,299
KANKURO: Creepy?

331
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,234
Look at them, with their
poison needles, and everything.

332
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:23,068
They're beautiful.

333
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,036
Isn't that right, Crow?

334
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,271
Aren't you beautiful?

335
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:27,072
TEMARI: The way you talk
to them like they're alive,

336
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:28,407
that's creepy.

337
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,276
You better watch it, or you
won't have any real friends

338
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:30,876
pretty soon.

339
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,877
KANKURO: What?

340
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,812
-And that ends our
lesson for today.

341
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,347
-What the heck's
she talking about?

342
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:37,650
You're my buddy, right, Crow?

343
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:37,716
