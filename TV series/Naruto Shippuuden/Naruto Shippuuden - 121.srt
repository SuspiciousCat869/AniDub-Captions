KISAME: Finally, it's about
time you settled down.

00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:25,233
What a handful this whole
thing's turning out to be.

00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,966
Kisame, you're back.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,100
-That's right.

10
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:37,266
But having to bring him
back without killing

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,400
him was quite a
bother, I'll tell you.

Here comes that rain
we were expecting.

15
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:53,766
-It looks like a big storm.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,100
-Come on.

17
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:58,600
Let's go find some cover,
otherwise we'll catch a chill.

18
00:00:58,633 --> 00:01:01,333
-Our leader is waiting for
word that we captured him.

19
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:03,900
Immediately after we secure
him and bring him in,

20
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:06,033
the sealing of both the
Three-Tails and Four-Tails

21
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,833
is to take place.

22
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:10,533
-So we make him wait a little
before the sealing begins.

23
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:11,900
I mean, it's not
like it's really

24
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:14,333
going to make any difference.

25
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,666
The sealing takes a
long time, anyway.

-It looks like he's dying.

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,866
You should handle the
elderly with care.

29
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,466
-You only say that because
you don't know this guy.

00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,433
Nabbing a jinchuriki who
uses the Corrosion Style

31
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:36,033
jutsu of the Four-Tails is
way harder than you think.

32
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:38,800
But you probably can't
understand my pain,

33
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:42,633
not having battled
the fellow directly.

34
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:43,133
-Hm.

35
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:49,000
-Well, I suppose it's
really my own fault

36
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:51,933
since I insisted on going alone.

37
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:55,833
Should I take care of
your objective, as well?

38
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:59,466
-You need to try and
settle down, Kisame.

39
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,733
-Sorry, I'm just a little tired.

40
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:03,900
I want to get this hunt
for the tailed beasts over

41
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:05,633
with, already.

42
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,800
-There isn't any need
to be so impatient.

43
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:10,433
This is going to take some time,
and that just can't be helped.

44
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:12,833
-Well, I'm not so
sure about that.

45
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,466
There are only a few
more to find, right?

46
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,066
And don't forget,
it's been decided

47
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,166
that we're going to seal
the Nine-Tails last of all,

48
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,866
or else it will
disrupt the balance

49
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,966
and the sealing statue will
come crashing to the ground.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,266
At least that's what
our leader said.

51
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,733
We all have to capture the
jinchuriki alive anyway, so

52
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:34,900
why can't we trap him now
and just keep him imprisoned?

53
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:38,466
-Huh, fine with me,
but it won't be easy.

54
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,933
Don't forget that
Deidara failed.

55
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:43,133
If we're to seal
the Nine-Tails last,

56
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,766
then we might as well
hunt him down last.

57
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,533
Besides, the Akatsuki's
been too conspicuous lately.

58
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:52,033
If we take the Nine-Tails
jinchuriki right now,

59
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:56,266
it will only rile the Hidden
Leaf Village all the more.

60
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,333
-Ha, do you really believe that?

61
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:00,666
-Not only is the Hidden
Leaf Village strong,

62
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,400
they have deep connections
with other villages.

63
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,400
If word gets around,
then it will only

64
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:07,466
make our jobs that much harder.

65
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,100
It's wiser to collect
everything up to the Eight-Tails

66
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:12,100
with as little
commotion as possible.

67
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:13,633
-I see.

68
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:17,400
I guess you're right
about that, Itachi.

69
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:19,366
-And there's the summons--

70
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
-I guess we just
got caught dawdling.

71
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:29,466
PAIN: You are late.

72
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,900
-We were just
finishing capturing

73
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:33,366
the jinchuriki when
you contacted us.

74
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,266
And then we had to tie him up
to make sure he couldn't escape.

75
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,566
It took us longer than
expected, but here we are.

76
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,566
-I have some urgent information
that I need to relay to you.

77
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,666
Orochimaru has been killed.

78
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,466
-Ha, it's been 10 years
since he left the Akatsuki.

79
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,833
At least we've been spared the
task of killing him ourselves.

80
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:58,366
Who cares if he's dead?

81
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,966
I wanted him gone
as much as I wanted

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,866
the Zombie Pair eliminated.

83
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,800
-Hidan and Kakuzu
were our comrades.

84
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,933
Don't say such things.

85
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:08,333
-Sorry.

86
00:04:08,366 --> 00:04:10,700
So, who were the ones
who did them in, anyway?

87
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,700
-It was the Hidden Leaf.

88
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:17,000
-Kakashi and the Nine-Tails
jinchuriki's team--

89
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:19,900
-Yes, they're extremely
strong, that team.

90
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:22,466
No wonder Deidara
got pummeled by them.

91
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,500
-Tobi, just keep
running your mouth,

92
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,066
and you'll push me to my limit.

93
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,066
Hm.

94
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,866
-Ha-ha, your limit?

95
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,933
Just calm down, Deidara.

96
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:35,433
You mean that you'll
get explosive, right?

97
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:38,166
As we all know, you
have such a short fuse.

98
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,433
-How dare you, Tobi!

99
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:40,133
[growl]

100
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,066
-That's enough, Deidara.

101
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,433
You're just proving
that Tobi's right.

102
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:45,733
[scoff]

103
00:04:45,766 --> 00:04:47,800
-Ha, you got in trouble
with our leader.

104
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,200
-But Tobi, you do talk too much.

105
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:51,933
Show some respect.

106
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:54,200
-OK, sorry.

107
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:59,000
-And we are supposed to get the
remaining jinchuriki with them?

108
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:00,833
[sigh]

109
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:02,866
-Killing Orochimaru
would take someone

110
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,766
with very special
skills, so who did it?

111
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,100
-Sasuke Uchiha.

112
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:11,400
-Too bad.

113
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:14,166
I wanted to be the one
to bring Orochimaru down.

114
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,266
-Hm.

115
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,566
Sasuke's good, but I'd
expect nothing less

116
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,433
from Itachi's kid brother.

117
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:22,266
-He's in the process of putting
together a team of his own,

118
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,266
all of them troublesome shinobi.

119
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,300
-What do you mean?

120
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,933
-You should remember
one of them--

121
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:32,100
one of the Hozuki brothers
of the Hidden Mist.

122
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:33,966
-Seigetsu?

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,333
That's a name I haven't
heard in a while.

124
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:40,666
-And Bipolar Jugo, so you need
to be on your guard, Itachi

125
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,300
and Kisame.

126
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,333
Odds are, they may be
targeting the two of you.

127
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:48,133
And the rest of you should
keep Sasuke Uchiha firmly

128
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,333
in you minds, as well.

129
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:53,100
After getting information
about Itachi and Kisame,

130
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:56,000
they may come after the
Akatsuki as a whole.

131
00:05:56,033 --> 00:06:00,733
-Kisame, what kind of guy
is this Suigetsu like, hm?

132
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:05,900
-It's been 10 years, but he
was a cute kid, a real prodigy.

133
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:08,166
He was called the
reincarnation of Zabuza,

134
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,933
the demon of the Hidden Mist.

135
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:11,033
-What are you?

136
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:13,000
Are you a fish out of
water, or something?

137
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:16,266
Quit sitting down every few
minutes to hydrate yourself.

138
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,600
-Ha.

139
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:20,066
Well, they sure seem like an
interesting lot, don't they?

140
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,466
Hm.

141
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,366
-Look, don't get involved.

142
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,833
You're only going to
stir up more trouble.

143
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:27,366
Just leave me out
of it, all right?

144
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,500
-Enough.

145
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:31,900
Itachi, Kisame, hurry up
and get the Four-Tails.

146
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,066
We'll seal him at the same
time as the Three-Tails.

147
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:35,566
-Understood.

148
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:43,900
-Now, that's just great.

149
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:46,833
I thought we'd get a chance to
rest a little bit, at least.

150
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:48,100
-We have no choice.

151
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:50,100
Let's hurry.

00:08:44,852 --> 00:08:47,885
who has the highest chance
of leading us to Sasuke.

156
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:51,918
Well, I can certainly
see the logic in that.

157
00:08:51,952 --> 00:08:53,918
But Itachi Uchiha?

158
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:56,285
Well, how do we play this?

159
00:08:56,318 --> 00:08:59,652
-If we can take just one of
the Akatsuki into custody,

160
00:08:59,685 --> 00:09:02,085
I wouldn't think that it'd
be too difficult for Ibiki

161
00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:04,585
to get information out
of whomever we capture.

162
00:09:04,618 --> 00:09:06,852
-I've already issued an
order to that effect.

163
00:09:06,885 --> 00:09:10,118
Each team is to try and capture
a member of the Akatsuki.

164
00:09:10,152 --> 00:09:13,085
And if they succeed, then
they'll bring that member in.

165
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:17,452
KAKASHI: Most likely that
will prove to be difficult.

166
00:09:17,485 --> 00:09:19,652
SAKURA: Kakashi Sensei--

167
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:23,418
-I'm afraid we won't be able to
make them talk quite so easily.

168
00:09:23,452 --> 00:09:25,118
Even those that we've
already encountered

169
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:27,218
have been far too dangerous.

170
00:09:27,252 --> 00:09:30,985
We couldn't even consider
taking them into custody.

171
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:33,485
-So what should we
do, Kakashi Sensei?

172
00:09:33,518 --> 00:09:36,618
-We can only be patient, keep
looking until we find Itachi.

173
00:09:42,818 --> 00:09:44,818
-I can't take it.

174
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:46,318
Let's take a break, already.

175
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,785
-Keep complaining and
dragging your feet like this,

176
00:09:48,818 --> 00:09:50,618
and we're never going
to make it there.

177
00:09:50,652 --> 00:09:51,852
SUIGETSU: Well, excuse me.

178
00:09:51,885 --> 00:09:55,152
But unlike you, I have a
very delicate constitution.

179
00:09:55,185 --> 00:09:56,285
-What?

180
00:09:56,318 --> 00:09:58,052
Look, why don't you just
go evaporate already,

181
00:09:58,085 --> 00:09:59,418
you water monster.

182
00:09:59,452 --> 00:10:01,118
-Hey, here's a better idea.

183
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:02,685
Why don't you get lost?

184
00:10:02,718 --> 00:10:04,752
Didn't you say you had
somewhere else to go.

185
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:07,618
[grumbles]

186
00:10:07,652 --> 00:10:09,218
-Enough, we're here.

187
00:10:09,252 --> 00:10:09,952
-Hm?

188
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,218
[screech]

189
00:10:14,985 --> 00:10:20,385
[music playing]

190
00:10:31,318 --> 00:10:33,718
-This next one is big.

191
00:10:33,752 --> 00:10:36,452
-You're here.

192
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:41,918
All right, we will begin the
sealing with the Three-Tails.

193
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:45,918
[music playing]

194
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:08,085
Everyone, assemble.

195
00:11:08,118 --> 00:11:11,918
[music playing]

196
00:11:16,118 --> 00:11:16,752
Let's begin.

197
00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:37,118
-This is it.

198
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:40,652
-I got to say, this is
one sketchy looking place.

199
00:11:40,685 --> 00:11:41,352
-Let's go.

200
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:48,952
-Uh-huh, a hideout in a
wasteland like this one, huh?

201
00:11:48,985 --> 00:11:51,485
I never heard of it.

202
00:11:51,518 --> 00:11:53,318
-This isn't Orochimaru's.

203
00:11:53,352 --> 00:11:56,052
It's a munitions store the
Uchiha clan used to use.

204
00:11:56,085 --> 00:11:59,085
We'll outfit ourselves
with supplies for battle.

205
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,785
-This is like a maze.

206
00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:02,318
All the passages look the same.

207
00:12:02,352 --> 00:12:04,118
It must be easy to
get lost in here.

208
00:12:04,152 --> 00:12:07,052
-Man, this place feels
depressing and stifling.

209
00:12:07,085 --> 00:12:08,618
I mean, it's hard to breathe.

210
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:12,452
DENKA: Hm, I'm sorry to
hear you feel that way.

211
00:12:12,485 --> 00:12:13,585
-Hm?

212
00:12:13,618 --> 00:12:17,152
-Ha, it's been a long
time, Denka and Hina.

213
00:12:17,185 --> 00:12:19,418
-Well, if it isn't
our Sasuke boy.

214
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:21,318
-So tell us, what
can we do for you?

215
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:21,818
Meow.

216
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,996
So tell us, what
can we do for you?

217
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:30,396
Meow.

218
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:33,629
-We need weapons and medicine,
as well as some other supplies.

219
00:12:33,662 --> 00:12:35,496
We need to prepare for battle.

220
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:36,762
-Are those really--

221
00:12:36,796 --> 00:12:37,596
-Ha.

222
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:39,562
Yeah, they're talking tanuki.

223
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:41,062
Come here little guys--

224
00:12:41,096 --> 00:12:41,562
[hiss]

225
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:42,762
-Whoa!

226
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:46,362
-They're ninja cats, so
be careful and respectful.

227
00:12:46,396 --> 00:12:47,962
Or they'll tear you apart.

228
00:12:47,996 --> 00:12:50,762
-You want to warn us about
stuff like that beforehand?

229
00:12:50,796 --> 00:12:52,262
-So, did you bring us a present?

230
00:12:52,296 --> 00:12:53,529
Meow meow.

231
00:12:53,562 --> 00:12:56,762
-Here, a bottle
of catnip for you.

232
00:12:56,796 --> 00:12:59,629
-It's my favorite, meow.

233
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:03,396
-Follow me, and I'll
take you to Granny Cat.

234
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:06,062
[meows]

235
00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:07,762
SASUKE: I am
grateful, Granny Cat.

236
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:10,662
-It has been too long
since I've seen you.

237
00:13:10,696 --> 00:13:13,296
I'm sorry you're
in such a hurry.

238
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:15,462
-Yeah, I have an important task.

239
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:20,296
-Now, you're not a
ninja cat, are you?

240
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:22,062
No you're not.

241
00:13:22,096 --> 00:13:23,129
-No good.

242
00:13:23,162 --> 00:13:25,229
Even the extra, extra
large doesn't fit.

243
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:25,729
-Sorry.

244
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:29,762
-So it's true.

245
00:13:29,796 --> 00:13:31,362
You're still going
to go after Itachi.

246
00:13:34,962 --> 00:13:37,762
To think that I've known the
both of you since you were just

247
00:13:37,796 --> 00:13:42,396
wee little things Never did
imagine it would come to this.

248
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:46,529
Now, you are the only
two remaining Uchiha.

249
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:48,962
And yet, you must
kill each other.

250
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,562
SASUKE: We'll be going
now, but thank you for all

251
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:53,929
that you've done.

252
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:55,329
[sigh]

253
00:13:55,362 --> 00:13:56,962
-Nothing fits him, Granny.

254
00:13:56,996 --> 00:14:00,462
Don't we have any larger clothes
for him to try on around here?

255
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:01,262
[groan]

256
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:02,329
-Did you check in that box?

257
00:14:02,362 --> 00:14:03,029
-- -I did.

258
00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:04,529
They're all too small.

259
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:07,629
-Then just wrap him in
that curtain over there.

260
00:14:07,662 --> 00:14:10,096
We're not running a clothing
store here, you know.

261
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:12,362
-But Granny Cat, that's so rude.

262
00:14:12,396 --> 00:14:14,029
They are paying us, you know.

263
00:14:17,862 --> 00:14:20,196
-There.

264
00:14:20,229 --> 00:14:23,496
PERVY SAGE: Hunt Itachi
to find Sasuke, huh?

265
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,829
All right, say we find Itachi.

266
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:28,929
What then?

267
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:33,062
-About that, I have an idea.

268
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:34,962
Can you spare some
time to discuss it?

269
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:41,362
[crowd noise]

270
00:14:45,362 --> 00:14:46,362
-Huh?

271
00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:48,562
Naruto, you don't
look pleased at all.

272
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,462
-Pervy Sage-- so, what are
you doing here, anyway?

273
00:14:52,496 --> 00:14:54,662
-Well, it's been awhile,
so I thought, perhaps

274
00:14:54,696 --> 00:14:58,496
I could share a meal
with my apprentice.

275
00:14:58,529 --> 00:14:59,896
-I don't know.

276
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:01,829
You buying?

277
00:15:01,862 --> 00:15:04,596
NARUTO: Man, what is
up with Kakashi Sensei?

278
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:08,162
We're all ready to go and he
shows up and stops everything.

279
00:15:08,196 --> 00:15:09,562
-That's just the way it is.

280
00:15:09,596 --> 00:15:12,529
Lots of preparation goes
into missions like this one.

281
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:13,762
-Like what?

282
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:15,862
-One small team isn't going
to be enough to pull off

283
00:15:15,896 --> 00:15:18,496
the kind of thing
you have in mind.

284
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:19,529
-What do you mean?

285
00:15:19,562 --> 00:15:20,796
I don't understand.

286
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:22,096
-Well, look.

287
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,029
If Itachi is killed, Sasuke
has no reason to show up.

288
00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:29,029
And so, we have to come up with
a way only to detain Itachi.

289
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,829
And doing that requires
a coordinated effort

290
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:33,429
involving more ninja.

291
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:35,696
Kakashi has his hands full
putting that very thing

292
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:37,529
together, right now.

293
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,629
-So, that's the plan.

294
00:15:40,662 --> 00:15:42,396
-But we're dealing
with Itachi here.

295
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:46,496
He's an extraordinary ninja,
so ordinary methods won't work.

296
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:47,696
-Yeah, you're right.

297
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:50,229
And we can't simply follow
him around, I guess.

298
00:15:50,262 --> 00:15:53,129
-What, and just bring Sasuke
back when he shows up.

299
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:54,662
I'm sure that you
know this, Naruto,

300
00:15:54,696 --> 00:15:56,962
but Sasuke has grown
so powerful that he

301
00:15:56,996 --> 00:15:59,396
was able to kill
Orochimaru himself.

302
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:01,629
-I'm well aware
of that, trust me.

303
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:02,696
But I made a promise.

304
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:05,296
I told Sakura that
I'd bring Sasuke back,

305
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:06,762
and that just what
I'm going to do.

306
00:16:06,796 --> 00:16:09,996
No question, I promised.

307
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:11,529
I don't go back on my word.

308
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:17,662
PERVY SAGE: There's
only one thing that

309
00:16:17,696 --> 00:16:20,062
matters if you're
a shinobi, and it

310
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:22,829
isn't the number of
jutsu you possess.

311
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:26,329
All you do need-- the
guts to never give up.

312
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:28,796
-It's all about guts.

313
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:29,896
That's what I believe.

314
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:33,129
That's my ninja way.

315
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:35,696
-I see you're just
as foolish as ever.

316
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:37,362
-Yeah well, I can't help it.

317
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,796
I am your apprentice, after all.

318
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:44,296
-Good grief, I got myself
one rude apprentice.

319
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:46,062
-What are you talking about?

320
00:16:46,096 --> 00:16:48,162
Rude, what's that even mean?

321
00:16:48,196 --> 00:16:51,629
-Exactly that, and thank
you for making my point.

322
00:16:51,662 --> 00:16:52,696
-You think I'm rude?

323
00:16:52,729 --> 00:16:53,762
Give me a break.

324
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:56,729
This coming from a
no-good pervy old man.

325
00:16:56,762 --> 00:17:00,496
-Here, just eat this.

326
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:04,762
-Ooh, hm.

327
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:08,729
The roast pork at
Ichiraku is just the best.

[music playing]

330
00:17:23,596 --> 00:17:26,729
TOBI: Man, sealing a tailed
beast is such a pain.

331
00:17:26,762 --> 00:17:28,929
And there's even more
after this round?

332
00:17:28,962 --> 00:17:31,629
Just thinking about
it all makes me tired.

333
00:17:31,662 --> 00:17:33,962
-Now then, where to?

334
00:17:33,996 --> 00:17:34,896
Hm.

335
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,362
-Wait, what do
you mean, Deidara?

336
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:40,296
Sorry, but I really have no
idea what you're trying to say.

337
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:41,796
-What do you think I mean?

338
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:43,929
Do we go for the
Nine-Tails jinchuriki who's

339
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:48,896
team is led by Kakashi, or do
we deal with Sasuke Uchiha?

340
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:50,996
-Frankly, I don't think
that we should mess around

341
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:51,996
with either one.

342
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,162
I mean, we've achieved
our objective.

343
00:17:54,196 --> 00:17:56,062
Sasuke is not even
a tailed beast.

344
00:17:56,096 --> 00:17:57,962
He isn't our concern.

345
00:17:57,996 --> 00:17:59,629
-Are you kidding me?

346
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,229
I owe them all some pay back.

347
00:18:01,262 --> 00:18:03,529
The Nine-Tailed jinchuriki
for punching me,

348
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:06,362
and Kakashi for
taking my right arm.

349
00:18:06,396 --> 00:18:07,629
Hm.

350
00:18:07,662 --> 00:18:10,929
And Sasuke, I must punish
him for killing Orochimaru

351
00:18:10,962 --> 00:18:14,096
when I wanted to be the one
to deliver the final blow.

352
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:15,762
-Oh, great.

353
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:19,429
Once this guy decides, he
just won't listen to reason.

354
00:18:19,462 --> 00:18:20,929
DEIDARA: Did you say something?

355
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:23,629
TOBI: Uh, no.

356
00:18:23,662 --> 00:18:26,296
DEIDARA: Hm, we're leaving.

357
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:29,296
-That Deidara has
gotten so worked up.

358
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:31,996
And all that fuss is over
going after your little brother

359
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:35,129
or our target, that
Nine-Tailed jinchuriki.

360
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:39,396
Are you OK with that, Itachi?

361
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:41,862
[thunder]

362
00:19:02,196 --> 00:19:04,162

00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:13,296
-I'm impressed.

365
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:17,196
You've planned this well.

366
00:19:17,229 --> 00:19:18,396
-This is awesome.

367
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:20,896
But wouldn't it be better
with even more people?

368
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:24,129
-It's not simply a matter
of manpower, Naruto.

369
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:27,996
For this job, two teams
working together is ideal.

370
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:29,696
We're only after
one or two targets,

371
00:19:29,729 --> 00:19:31,796
so two teams will give
us the right amount

372
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:33,829
of strength and flexibility.

373
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:35,996
Anymore, and we could
be detected too easily

374
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:38,896
and have difficulties
within our chain of command.

375
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:42,262
Plus, it would
hinder our mobility.

376
00:19:42,296 --> 00:19:44,862
PERVY SAGE: Restraining an enemy
requires a lot more technique

377
00:19:44,896 --> 00:19:46,662
than just killing him does.

378
00:19:46,696 --> 00:19:48,662
In assembling the
teams, we thought

379
00:19:48,696 --> 00:19:51,329
it wise to select ninja
whose skills compliment

380
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:54,596
each other's, ninja who are
used to working together.

381
00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:58,362
-Well, I can't see you doing
much better than these ninja.

382
00:19:58,396 --> 00:19:59,929
-Thank you, my lady.

383
00:19:59,962 --> 00:20:02,029
I believe that we're
ready to set out now.

384
00:20:02,062 --> 00:20:06,362
But what miserable weather
for a mission launch.

385
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:07,596
-Come on guys.

386
00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:09,362
Let's go, already.

perfect for cooling down

390
00:20:16,796 --> 00:20:19,629
I hereby authorize the
mission to locate and detain

391
00:20:19,662 --> 00:20:20,796
Itachi Uchiha.

392
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:23,296
All of you, be careful,
but make certain

393
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:24,596
that you complete the mission.

394
00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:25,129

basically comprised

of one ninja and
two ninja hounds.

398
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,959
Just in case the jinchuriki,
Naruto, is attacked,

399
00:22:09,993 --> 00:22:13,959
Yamato and a sensory-type ninja,
Hinata, will accompany him.

You know we're after
Itachi and Sasuke.

But even if you
find either of them,

405
00:22:21,326 --> 00:22:23,226
don't engage them yourselves.

line, but I say it
