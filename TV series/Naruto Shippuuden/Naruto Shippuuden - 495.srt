00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:51,594
{\an1}<i>(Kiba) A mission to find a</i>
<i>wedding present, huh?</i>

2
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:55,265
{\an1}<i>(Shino) The Hokage's giving us a</i>
<i>wonderful opportunity to find a</i>
<i>great gift.</i>

3
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:58,234
{\an1}<i>One that epitomizes the</i>
<i>friendship that we all share.</i>

4
00:01:58,268 --> 00:02:01,371
{\an1}<i>(Choji) That's right, we've</i>
<i>never had a wedding celebration</i>
<i>like this before!</i>

5
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:06,276
{\an1}Naruto and Hinata are the first
ones among our group of friends
to get married, after all.

6
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:09,045
{\an1}We gotta do our best to find
something that they'll both
like.

7
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:09,778
Akamaru!

8
00:02:09,812 --> 00:02:11,714
{\an1}I feel just the same way!

9
00:02:11,747 --> 00:02:14,750
{\an1}I am fired up! I will make
sure they love my gift!

10
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,653
{\an1}So do you already know what
you're getting them, Lee?

11
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:19,221
I have no clue.

12
00:02:19,254 --> 00:02:20,155
[grunts]

13
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,625
{\an1}However! If I put myself in
Naruto's shoes and think about
how he feels...

14
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:29,031
{\an1}I know that it will come to me
naturally. I will not lose to
anyone!

15
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:30,498
Hah!

16
00:02:30,531 --> 00:02:32,167
{\an1}Wake up, Akamaru!

17
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:34,769
Whoa! [groans]

18
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:39,073
{\an1}Well, traditionally, getting
wedding gifts isn't a
win-or-lose competition.

19
00:02:40,475 --> 00:02:43,945
{\an1}But, still, let's give it our
all!

20
00:02:44,345 --> 00:02:47,915
{\an1}This is for Hinata. So let's
all try our hardest!

21
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:50,251
{\an1}<i>(Shino) There's no need to get</i>
<i>so worked up.</i>

22
00:02:50,284 --> 00:02:53,421
{\an1}<i>The reason is if you relax,</i>
<i>you'll think of something.</i>

23
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:56,656
{\an1}Everyone seems really fired up
about this.

24
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,426
{\an1}I can't think of anything!

25
00:02:58,459 --> 00:02:59,559
You, Choji?

26
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,829
{\an1}I have a pretty good idea of
what I'm gonna get. [grunts]

27
00:03:02,863 --> 00:03:06,033
{\an1}Damn it. This is such a drag.

28
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:06,565
[grunts]

29
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,346
{\an1}<i>(Kakashi) We're going to assess</i>
<i>and rank each gift. </i>

30
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:23,149
{\an1}That way we can determine who'll
attend the wedding ceremony...

31
00:03:23,182 --> 00:03:26,085
{\an1}and who'll be placed on duty for
that day's missions.

32
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:29,554
{\an1}<i>(Kakashi) In other words, we're</i>
<i>going to sift and screen through</i>
<i>the gifts.</i>

33
00:03:29,587 --> 00:03:31,790
{\an1}I'd better not tell anyone
that.

34
00:03:31,823 --> 00:03:33,992
[screams]

35
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:36,328
Hello!

36
00:03:36,362 --> 00:03:38,364
{\an1}Oh! It's you, Lee!

37
00:03:39,465 --> 00:03:42,501
{\an1}The ramen Naruto gets most
often, please!

38
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:46,237
{\an1}Naruto's favorite ramen, huh?
Let me see, here.

39
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:49,706
{\an1}Oh, that's an easy one! It's our
large miso and char siu!

40
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,808
Oh, yeah, right!

41
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:53,044
{\an1}But why the sudden curiosity?

42
00:03:53,078 --> 00:03:55,246
{\an1}If I am going to understand
Naruto's feelings...

43
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,383
{\an1}I figured that I should first
try the things that he likes to
eat!

44
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,585
{\an1}Well, I don't really get all
this, but go ahead and take a
seat.

45
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:02,454
Okay!

46
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:06,457
Idiot. Idiot.

47
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:07,991
[sighs]

48
00:04:08,025 --> 00:04:09,159
How was it?

49
00:04:09,193 --> 00:04:11,962
{\an1}[tearing up] Whoa!

50
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:17,633
{\an1}So delicious! Light, yet rich,
with volume and punch, you want
to slurp it down all at once!

51
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:18,235
[sighs]

52
00:04:19,303 --> 00:04:20,970
{\an1}Do you get Naruto's feelings a
little better now?

53
00:04:21,003 --> 00:04:25,475
{\an1}[sobs] I have come to understand
why he would always want to
order this ramen!

54
00:04:25,508 --> 00:04:27,743
{\an1}But other than that, no, I do
not.

55
00:04:27,777 --> 00:04:29,512
That's too bad.

56
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:33,516
{\an1}If you could tell how a guy
feels just by eating ramen, life
would be a lot easier.

57
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:38,421
{\an1}Oh, hey, wait! Iruka, you were
Naruto's teacher. So you must
know all about him, right?

58
00:04:39,555 --> 00:04:44,426
{\an1}Iruka Sensei?! I am sorry! I
was deep in thought and did
not notice you there!

59
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:49,164
{\an1}Oh, don't worry. Your name
is Lee, isn't that right? You're
a student of Guy's, aren't you?

60
00:04:49,197 --> 00:04:52,167
{\an1}Yes! And you were Naruto's
teacher in the Academy!

61
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,835
{\an1}Which means that you must know
how Naruto thinks!

62
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:57,305
{\an1}Please, you have to tell me
everything you can about
him!

63
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,874
{\an1}The thing is, I was his teacher
a long time ago.

64
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:03,210
{\an1}He's earned praise for so many
things that don't really have
anything to do with me.

65
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:05,379
{\an1}And I only see him once in a
while anymore.

66
00:05:05,412 --> 00:05:07,348
Oh, I see.

67
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:11,418
{\an1}Why are you even trying to
understand Naruto's feelings
in the first place?

68
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:13,087
{\an1}For his wedding gift.

69
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,689
{\an1}So that I would be able to find
something that he is certain to
like.

70
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:19,926
{\an1}And I thought that the best
way to start would be to
understand his feelings.

71
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,195
{\an1}Oh, so that's it. I get it
now.

72
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:23,330
[sighs]

73
00:05:24,565 --> 00:05:26,766
{\an1}Anyway, to convey my intense
respect for my friend Naruto...

74
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:30,669
{\an1}I am going to throw my whole
being into finding the
best wedding gift for him!

75
00:05:30,703 --> 00:05:33,139
{\an1}<i>(Lee) Please excuse me, Iruka</i>
<i>Sensei!</i>

76
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,674
[yells]

77
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:38,844
{\an1}Wow, he is exactly the same as
Guy.

78
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:41,214
{\an1}Sorry about all that ruckus
just now.

79
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:45,717
{\an1}Oh no, I'm fine! In fact, I'm
happy! I'm glad Naruto has a
friend like him.

80
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:50,355
{\an1}Found ya, Iruka Sensei! You
still haven't recorded your
congratulatory message yet!

81
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:53,859
{\an1}Oh, that's right. You think
you can wait just a little
longer?

82
00:05:53,892 --> 00:05:55,726
{\an1}Aw, man, not again.

83
00:05:56,195 --> 00:05:57,429
{\an1}Naruto's wedding gift.

84
00:05:57,462 --> 00:06:00,199
{\an1}Naruto's wedding gift. Ah ha!

85
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:01,899
{\an1}Naruto's wedding gift.

86
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:04,303
{\an1}Naruto's [gasps] Wait! Uh!

87
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,743
{\an1}Yes, of course! Dumbbells
would be just perfect!

88
00:06:14,278 --> 00:06:17,814
Naruto! Hinata!
Congratulations on your
marriage!

89
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:21,818
{\an1}<i>(Lee) Please use these dumbbells</i>
<i>and find everlasting happiness.</i>

90
00:06:21,851 --> 00:06:23,820
No! Not! Enough!

91
00:06:23,853 --> 00:06:28,391
{\an1}There can be no denying that
dumbbells are most definitely
useful and welcome tools.

92
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:32,095
{\an1}And! Their heaviness is surely
symbolic of the solidity...

93
00:06:32,128 --> 00:06:34,497
{\an1}and the depth of friendship I
share with Naruto!

94
00:06:34,531 --> 00:06:35,498
But...

95
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,436
{\an1}<i>(Lee) It is possible that Naruto</i>
<i>will get so hooked on muscle</i>

very special bond...

99
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:48,578
{\an1}giving him dumbbells might not
be the best choice.

100
00:06:49,845 --> 00:06:52,047
{\an1}I will have to think of
something else!

101
00:06:52,081 --> 00:06:55,884
Hmm.

102
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,121
{\an1}[grunts] I cannot think of
anything! At times like this
I...!

{\an1}I am sorry. I just could not
do it by myself.

124
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,915
{\an1}I had no choice but to ask you

you, but...

00:08:03,948 --> 00:08:07,586
{\an1}[sighs] You, too huh?

126
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,521
Yeah.

127
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:12,824
{\an1}It's just a more traditional
gift won't really be able to
convey our true feelings.

128
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:15,894
{\an1}But a present that does a better
job of representing who we
are...

129
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:17,862
{\an1}may not be something that makes
them happy.

130

complicated than I thought.

Yes!

136
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:36,380
{\an1}Oh, I get it! Instead of just
sitting around trying to think
of something...

137
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:39,450
{\an1}if we look at actual items, it
might help give us ideas!

I'm sure we'll be able to find
something...

139

{\an1}that expresses who we are while
also making Naruto and Hinata
happy!

140
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:52,261
{\an1}You are right! For example. How
about a sword like this?

141
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:57,500
{\an1}Uhh. It does look nicely
upscale.

142
00:08:57,533 --> 00:09:00,403
{\an1}But it doesn't really have any
connection to a wedding.

143
00:09:00,703 --> 00:09:01,904
Wrong!

144
00:09:10,446 --> 00:09:13,716
{\an1}They can use it for their
first effort together as man
and wife!

145
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,350
{\an1}To cut the cake, seriously?!

146
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:16,885
It is no good?

147
00:09:16,918 --> 00:09:17,620
Not really.

148
00:09:19,354 --> 00:09:21,456
{\an1}I mean, don't you think a
cake-cutter would rank pretty
low on the usefulness meter?

149
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,258
{\an1}Well, then, how about these?

150
00:09:24,593 --> 00:09:30,097
{\an1}Tonfa? It's "you," since
you're a taijutsu specialist,
but Naruto and Hinata aren't.

151
00:09:30,131 --> 00:09:33,835
{\an1}And also, those don't actually
have any connection to a
wedding, either.

152
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:35,069
Wrong!

153
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:39,306
{\an1}I believe they would be very
useful for everyday married
life.

154
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,008
{\an1}Since they will have more
laundry to do!

155
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,410
{\an1}What?! For hanging laundry?!

156
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:46,447
{\an1}All the same, I do not think
Naruto would be pleased if he
got this as a gift.

157
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,916
{\an1}Maybe you should try to think
of something a bit less out of
the ordinary.

158
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:52,919
{\an1}[sighs] You are so lucky,
Tenten.

159
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:56,524
{\an1}All you have to do is give
them the things that you
always use.

160
00:09:56,824 --> 00:09:59,827
{\an1}Huh? You think getting kunai
would make them happy?

161
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,595
{\an1}But those aren't really
necessary for married life at
all.

162
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:04,631
{\an1}Wrong, they are very useful!

163
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:11,805
{\an1}For newlyweds who cannot
decide what they should have
for dinner.

164
00:10:11,838 --> 00:10:12,806
{\an1}They are perfect!

165
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,007
{\an1}Come on! Is that any way to
use a kunai?!

166
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,476
Idiot! Idiot!

167
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:19,478
{\an1}I cannot believe we did not
find a single thing.

168
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:21,881
{\an1}We still have time. We'll just
try again.

169
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:28,887
{\an1}[yawns] I cannot think of a
single thing to get them.

170
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:32,056
{\an1}<i>(Neji) Lee. Hey, Lee!</i>

171
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,293
Hmm?

172
00:10:35,394 --> 00:10:36,662
Neji!

173
00:10:38,362 --> 00:10:40,666
{\an1}When you get stuck on something,
you even continue to struggle
with it in your dreams.

174
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:42,366
{\an1}That's so like you, Lee.

175
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,702
{\an1}Neji! Is that really you,
Neji?

176
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:47,305
{\an1}You were groaning pretty loud,
there, you know.

177
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:50,541
{\an1}I just cannot find a gift for
Naruto and Hinata's wedding!

178
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:52,910
{\an1}Not even after spending the
whole day looking!

179
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:56,314
{\an1}All that I have done is use up
my ideas and energy!

180
00:10:56,347 --> 00:10:58,215
{\an1}But why are you here, Neji?

181
00:10:58,248 --> 00:11:02,152
{\an1}Because I have something to
tell you.

182
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:04,421
{\an1}Neji, I- I just...

183
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:06,723
{\an1}I know. There's no need to
speak of it.

184
00:11:06,756 --> 00:11:09,192
{\an1}Listen, Lee, and remember this
carefully!

185
00:11:09,226 --> 00:11:13,530
{\an1}Physical strength over
endurance! Physical strength
over endurance!

186
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:15,966
{\an1}Physical strength over
endurance?

187
00:11:15,998 --> 00:11:18,133
{\an1}And don't forget: Hyuga.

188
00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:20,202
{\an1}What? Hey wait, Neji!

189
00:11:20,437 --> 00:11:21,705
[distraught]

190
00:11:23,138 --> 00:11:24,875
{\an1}I thought you came because I was
having a dilemma about a wedding
gift...

191
00:11:24,908 --> 00:11:27,510
{\an1}and you wanted to give me
advice! Hm? [gasps]

192
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:31,514
Neji!

193
00:11:36,352 --> 00:11:39,622
{\an1}Naruto and Hinata, my
congratulations.

194
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:43,726
{\an1}Naruto, who'd've guessed a bad
kid would become such a great
man?

195
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,662
{\an1}And Hinata, please make sure
to take good care of Naruto.

196
00:11:47,695 --> 00:11:49,797
{\an1}[sighs] All right, I think
that's it!

197
00:11:49,831 --> 00:11:50,832
Okay!

198
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,003
{\an1}That was perfect! I can just
see Big Brother Naruto's eyes
welling up with tears!

199
00:11:55,035 --> 00:11:58,840
{\an1}Okay, I'm off to edit this! I
can't wait to see how it turns
out!

200
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,975
Oh, Lee! Hey!

201
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:03,243
{\an1}Hello, Iruka Sensei.

202
00:12:03,277 --> 00:12:05,713
{\an1}[gasps] What the hell happened
to you?

203
00:12:05,747 --> 00:12:08,615
{\an1}I cannot decide on a gift for
Naruto's wedding.

204
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:11,920
{\an1}And on top of that, an old
friend appeared in a dream and
gave me advice...

205
00:12:11,953 --> 00:12:15,322
{\an1}that does not make any sense at
all, and I could not sleep
thinking about it!

206
00:12:15,355 --> 00:12:17,858
{\an1}Two thousand seven hundred
sixty-five sheep.

207
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:20,192
{\an1}Two thousand seven hundred
sixty-six sheep.

208
00:12:20,226 --> 00:12:23,897
{\an1}Two thousand seven hundred
sixty-seven Nejis. Hold on,
Nejis?

209
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:25,832
Neji, you jerk!

210
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,301
{\an1}Oh, wow, that sounds terrible.

211
00:12:28,334 --> 00:12:32,471
{\an1}Maybe I will never be able to
convey the depth of my
friendship to Naruto!

212
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:35,608
{\an1}Now, there, there. Don't take
all of this so seriously.

213
00:12:36,642 --> 00:12:39,077
{\an1}<i>(Iruka) I'm sure it's a big</i>
<i>struggle for all of you.</i>

214
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:41,212
{\an1}But I'm actually happy.

215
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:43,214
Happy? Why?

216
00:12:43,248 --> 00:12:48,153
{\an1}Well, because it's really
gratifying to discover that a
student I once taught...

217
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:50,322
{\an1}has friends who'll go to such
lengths for him.

218
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:54,793
{\an1}I realize that it might sound
like I'm just trying to make
you feel better.

219
00:12:54,826 --> 00:12:56,695
{\an1}Oh, no, not at all.

220
00:12:56,728 --> 00:12:58,296
{\an1}<i>(Iruka) Actually...</i>

221
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:02,500
{\an1}<i>I've never really had a chance</i>
<i>to talk like this with Naruto's</i>
<i>friends before now.</i>

222
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:06,605
{\an1}But thanks to his upcoming
wedding, I got to talk to you
and the others.

223
00:13:06,638 --> 00:13:08,172
{\an1}And as a result of that...

224
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:12,743
{\an1}you've all allowed me to see
another side of Naruto that I
never really knew about.

225
00:13:12,776 --> 00:13:14,578
{\an1}I'm grateful for that.

226
00:13:14,612 --> 00:13:18,616
{\an1}Now that I think about it, I
haven't seen him much since he
graduated.

227
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:22,052
{\an1}So you guys probably know a
whole lot more about Naruto than
I do!

228
00:13:22,086 --> 00:13:24,054
{\an1}What?! Is that really true?!

229
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:26,490
{\an1}Huh? Why's that so shocking to
you?

230
00:13:26,523 --> 00:13:31,829
{\an1}I was just hoping you would
be able to help me come up with
ideas for Naruto's wedding gift.

231
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:35,498
{\an1}I'm very sorry that I can't be
of more help to you.

232
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:39,369
{\an1}But considering all of the
effort that you're putting into
finding a gift for him...

233
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:42,772
{\an1}I'm certain that Naruto will be
happy with whatever you choose
to give him.

234
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:44,774
{\an1}You really think so?

235
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:49,211
{\an1}In fact, if he dares to
complain, as his teacher, I'll
knock some sense into him again!

236
00:13:49,244 --> 00:13:49,712
[gasps]

237
00:13:50,545 --> 00:13:51,480
{\an1}Did I sound conceited saying
that?

238
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:55,817
{\an1}Knock sense into him as his
teacher? Yes, that is it!

239
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:57,020
What now?

240
00:13:57,452 --> 00:14:01,289
{\an1}I had forgotten something
important! Yes!

241
00:14:01,323 --> 00:14:04,826
{\an1}I must thank you, Iruka
Sensei! Now!

242
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,629
What the?!

243
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:13,334
{\an1}[chuckles] So you've come, huh,
Lee?

244
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:15,037
{\an1}[grunt] Guy Sensei!

245
00:14:15,302 --> 00:14:17,672
{\an1}I figured you'd show up right
around now.

246
00:14:17,705 --> 00:14:22,843
{\an1}Judging by your expression, it
seems that you're still on the
horns of a dilemma, aren't you?

247
00:14:22,877 --> 00:14:24,612
{\an1}What?! How can you tell?!

248
00:14:24,645 --> 00:14:28,115
{\an1}Just one glance at you and I can
see that you've been training
all night...

249
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:30,584
{\an1}because something is weighing
heavily on your mind.

250
00:14:30,885 --> 00:14:32,086
Guy Sensei!

251
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:33,020
{\an1}And let me guess.

252
00:14:34,855 --> 00:14:36,924
{\an1}Your worries have something to
do with the wedding gift that
you've been trying to pick out.

253
00:14:36,957 --> 00:14:37,657
[gasps]

254
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:41,594
{\an1}Guy Sensei! Can you read what
is in my heart and mind?!

255
00:14:41,628 --> 00:14:45,465
{\an1}How long have the two of us
been together in the
springtime of our youth, Lee?

256
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:50,103
{\an1}Guy Sensei, I cannot even
decide what I should give
Naruto for his wedding gift!

257
00:14:50,136 --> 00:14:54,673
{\an1}I am still only half a shinobi!
Please, knock some sense into
me! Please!

258
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:59,311
{\an1}Well said! It's bugging me,
too! Let's search for a gift
together!

259
00:15:00,245 --> 00:15:01,780
{\an1}Guy Sensei! [grunts]

260
00:15:01,814 --> 00:15:02,448
Lee!

261
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:03,015
Guy Sensei!

262
00:15:03,048 --> 00:15:04,483
Huh?! [gasps]

263
00:15:04,516 --> 00:15:06,351
[shudders]

264
00:15:06,385 --> 00:15:08,821
{\an1}<i>(Guy) Let's set some ground</i>
<i>rules.</i>

265
00:15:08,854 --> 00:15:11,957
{\an1}First, a wedding gift can't be
something common.

266
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,660
{\an1}However, it mustn't be too
unconventional, either.

267
00:15:14,693 --> 00:15:17,863
{\an1}Yes. We figured out that much
by ourselves.

268
00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:20,165
{\an1}It's just from that point on
that we got stuck.

269
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:23,701
{\an1}And the wedding gift should also
be one that leaves a lasting
impression...

270
00:15:23,735 --> 00:15:27,138
{\an1}and conveys true friendship,
effort, and triumph in choosing
it.

271
00:15:27,171 --> 00:15:31,209
{\an1}So what would be a gift that
exemplifies me and the hot
springtime of youth?!

272
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:32,543
{\an1}[distraught] What is it?!

273
00:15:32,577 --> 00:15:36,413
{\an1}Hmm. Well, if such a thing
does exist then it would...!

274
00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:39,984
{\an1}<i>(Guy) Definitely include wearing</i>
<i>a fashionable bodysuit!</i>

275
00:15:40,017 --> 00:15:41,885
{\an1}Huh?! But why a bodysuit?

276
00:15:41,918 --> 00:15:45,223
{\an1}Yes, of course! The hot
springtime of youth means
sweat and tears!

277
00:15:45,255 --> 00:15:47,858
{\an1}Can sweat and tears be given
as gifts?!

278
00:15:47,891 --> 00:15:48,558
Eww gross!

279
00:15:48,592 --> 00:15:49,459
<i>(Guy) Wait, Lee!</i>

280
00:15:50,594 --> 00:15:53,230
{\an1}In the first place, can man live
on willpower alone?!

281
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:57,067
{\an1}Can he overcome the dangers of
divorce only with patience?!

282
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,236
{\an1}Wait, Sensei, you're going
off-topic!

283
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:02,905
{\an1}I have been thinking the same
thing! Should curry be
medium-hot? Or super-spicy?!

284
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:04,406
{\an1}No one's on-topic anymore!

285
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,510
{\an1}I'll circle the village on my
hands five thousand times!

286
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:09,411
{\an1}I will do five thousand two
hundred, then!

287
00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:10,980
{\an1}Five thousand three hundred
times!

288
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,114
{\an1}Five thousand four
hundred!

289
00:16:12,148 --> 00:16:13,249
Enough!

290
00:16:15,283 --> 00:16:16,417
[gasps]

291
00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:19,255
{\an1}It's true. We've gone way
off-track, here.

292
00:16:19,287 --> 00:16:22,791
{\an1}So, let's just go back to the
beginning and go over the basics
again.

293
00:16:22,824 --> 00:16:24,559
The basics?

294
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:25,827
Yes! Of course!

295
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,596
{\an1}First of all, what is a
wedding ceremony?

296
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:32,000
{\an1}That is a very philosophical
question to ask.

297
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,269
{\an1}Uh, is that really where we're
gonna start?

298
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:38,840
{\an1}Then let me ask you this: what
is absolutely necessary for a
wedding ceremony?

299
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,608
{\an1}[gasps] Well, would it be
love?

300
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:42,876
You're a poet.

301
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,314
{\an1}But be that as it may, I believe
that the more correct answer is
the bride and groom.

302
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:49,116
{\an1}Oh! You are right!

303
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:54,353
{\an1}Yes, exactly! A wedding ceremony
without the couple is not a
wedding ceremony at all.

304
00:16:54,387 --> 00:16:56,355
{\an1}It's just a regular old
ceremony.

305
00:16:56,389 --> 00:17:00,560
{\an1}And who knows? One could even
say that it's more like a party
than an actual ceremony!

306
00:17:00,593 --> 00:17:02,296
{\an1}How blind I have been!

307
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:02,896
Guy Sensei!

308
00:17:04,597 --> 00:17:06,499
{\an1}You have the stunning ability to
see what the truth of something
is beneath the surface!

309
00:17:06,532 --> 00:17:07,834
You are amazing!

310
00:17:07,867 --> 00:17:09,602
{\an1}You don't need to go
overboard.

311
00:17:09,635 --> 00:17:12,171
{\an1}You have always been and always
will be my role model!

312
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:14,607
{\an1}My everlasting hero, my guiding
light!

313
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,178
{\an1}Okay so now that that is all
settled, we can think about what
kind of gift would be the...

314
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:21,814
{\an1}best to please the happy couple
on their wedding day, right?!

315
00:17:21,848 --> 00:17:22,949
Absolutely!

316
00:17:22,982 --> 00:17:24,683
{\an1}I'm getting a bad feeling
about this.

317
00:17:24,716 --> 00:17:28,353
{\an1}All right, then, I'll be the
groom, and Lee, you can
portray the bride.

318
00:17:28,386 --> 00:17:29,487
{\an1}Okay, Guy Sensei!

319
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:30,289
I knew it!

320
00:17:30,323 --> 00:17:31,122
[grunting]

321
00:17:31,156 --> 00:17:33,058
{\an1}Why do I have to play the
baby?!

322
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,826
Not this again!

323
00:17:35,392 --> 00:17:36,294
Hi.

324
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:37,796
Honey, I'm home.

325
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:38,797
[gasps]

326
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,432
{\an1}Do you have any idea what time
it is?!

327
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:44,835
{\an1}It is time for the new spring
fashions!

328
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:49,074
[grunting]

329
00:17:49,107 --> 00:17:52,476
{\an1}Huh? [grunts] How dare you!

330
00:17:52,977 --> 00:17:55,379
{\an1}Seventh Gate of Shock! Open!

331
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,848
[screams]

332
00:17:58,515 --> 00:18:01,051
{\an1}[heavy breathing]

333
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:03,787
{\an1}Well, Lee, have you gotten any
ideas yet?

334
00:18:03,821 --> 00:18:09,492
{\an1}I believe that I have almost
figured it out, but after all
that, it is still far off.

335
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:14,331
{\an1}Never mind. You're never going
to arrive at an answer if you
think too deeply about it.

336
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:17,367
{\an1}I doubt Neji would speak to
you after that role-playing.

337
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:20,535
{\an1}No. But he would, if it's for
Hinata's sake.

338
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,973
{\an1}<i>(Guy) The husband's young female</i>
<i>coworker appears out of</i>
<i>nowhere...</i>

339
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:27,977
{\an1}<i>to threaten his peaceful family</i>
<i>life. Neji would definitely take</i>
<i>on that role!</i>

340
00:18:28,011 --> 00:18:32,282
{\an1}No way! [grunts] Seriously,
how can you misunderstand Neji
so much?!

341
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:35,117
{\an1}Even if it's only as a ghost,
I'm sure that Neji would
appear!

342
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,552
{\an1}You think that Neji
would appear?! Oh!

343
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:41,522
{\an1}Physical strength over
endurance! Physical strength
over endurance!

344
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:44,458
I get it!

345
00:18:44,492 --> 00:18:49,231
{\an1}At last! [chuckles] So that
was your message, Neji!

346
00:18:49,264 --> 00:18:53,402
{\an1}It actually was not intended
for me at all, it was meant
for Hinata instead.

347
00:18:53,434 --> 00:18:54,568
{\an1}What's that, Lee?

348
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:58,172
{\an1}Physical strength is essential
to protect a family!

349
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,740
{\an1}It is the highest form of
strength!

350
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:04,779
{\an1}Yes, that's right! Cooking,
washing, cleaning, raising the
kids, shopping.

351
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:07,915
{\an1}The newlywed life is a nonstop
test of strength!

352
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:12,086
{\an1}Oh Yes! And newlyweds must
prepare for that!

353
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,525
{\an1}If that's really the case,
then there's only one possible
answer to what you're seeking!

354
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:20,160
{\an1}The truest gift from us is.

355
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,494
Some dumbbells!

356
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,662
{\an1}Are you kidding?!

357
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:24,030
Guy Sensei.

358
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:25,332
Oh, Lee!

359
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,666
{\an1}[sobs] Guy Sensei!

360
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,467
[sobs] Lee!

361
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,269
[grunts]

362
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,105
{\an1}All right, Lee, you shall give
the left dumbbell to them!

363
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:32,771
Yes!

364
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,073
{\an1}And I'll give the right!

365
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:35,908
{\an1}Let us go, Guy Sensei!

366
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:40,112
{\an1}Yes! Our wedding gift will
lose to no one! [yells]

367
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:41,780
[groans]

368
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:46,118
{\an1}[gasps] Okay, I'm gonna go
with a custom-made kunai.

369
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:50,155
[humming]

370
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,224
What?! You fool!

{\an1}<i>(Teuchi) You want a delivery?</i>

372

{\an1}So, you've decided on a
wedding gift, have you?

373
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,130
{\an1}Yes! And all the thanks.

374
00:19:59,163 --> 00:20:04,402
{\an1}Go to Guy Sensei and you as
well, Iruka Sensei. It truly
pays to have great mentors!

375
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:08,638
{\an1}Well, if you believe that I
was able to help you, then
that makes me very happy.

376
00:20:08,672 --> 00:20:09,907
{\an1}What are you saying?

377
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:13,944
{\an1}Naruto is blessed to have a
mentor like you! I am sure he
feels the same!

378
00:20:13,977 --> 00:20:15,279
{\an1}Oh, uh, thank you.

379
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,583
{\an1}Okay, I am going to go take a
look at some dumbbells, so if
you will excuse me, please.

380
00:20:19,616 --> 00:20:23,153
[grunting]

381
00:20:23,186 --> 00:20:25,455
{\an7}<i>Naruto's mentor, huh?</i>

382
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:30,494
{\an7}<i>Maybe I should find out more</i>
<i>about how Naruto's grown after</i>
<i>leaving my care.</i>

383
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:33,296
{\an7}<i>And what kind of bonds he's made</i>
<i>with his friends.</i>

384
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,699
{\an7}<i>After all, if I'm truly</i>
<i>Naruto's mentor...</i>

{\an1}<i>(Konohamaru) Oh! Iruka Sensei!</i>

386
00:20:38,168 --> 00:20:39,269
We meet again!

387
00:20:39,302 --> 00:20:41,904
{\an1}Oh, Konohamaru! You have great
timing!

388
00:20:41,937 --> 00:20:45,908
{\an1}About the message I recorded
earlier, would it be okay if I
do it over?

389
00:20:45,941 --> 00:20:47,943
{\an1}Yeah, sure! But why?

390
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:52,915
{\an1}I want to find out more about
Naruto and send him a proper
message this time.

391
00:20:52,948 --> 00:20:55,151
{\an1}A message worthy of his
mentor.

{\an1}<i>(Ayame) I'm back!</i>

394
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:02,057
Uh, Let me see.

395
00:21:05,126 --> 00:21:06,294
[chuckles]

396

{\an1}I'll have the miso char siu.
Make it a large.

siu!
