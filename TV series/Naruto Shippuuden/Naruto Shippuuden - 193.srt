{\an1}Yeah, what's up?

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,658
Ino needs you. What are
you guys doing?

4
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:26,126
{\an1}Just sorting these
photographs.

5
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,362
Photos? What for?

6
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,531
{\an1}They were all salvaged
from the debris.

7
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:34,902
{\an1}I'm sure they're
important to someone,
so, frankly, we want to

8
00:00:34,936 --> 00:00:36,804
{\an1}return them to their
rightful owners.

9
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:39,874
You want to look through
them and see if you
recognize anyone?

10
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:43,111
{\an1}Sure! I'd be happy to
help you out in any way I
can!

00:00:49,017 --> 00:00:50,385
{\an1}Wait, is that-?

13
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:52,420
{\an1}I just remembered
something I've gotta do!

14
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:53,655
{\an1}Mm?

15
00:00:53,688 --> 00:00:55,255
{\an1}I need to take this photo
with me!

16
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:56,256
Wait! Naruto!

17
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,258
{\an1}Oh! That's right...

18
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,862
{\an1}Do you know if there are
any tulips blooming
nearby?

19
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:05,700
{\an4}Oh, you're looking for
tulips? You know, that's
an exceptionally romantic
flower, Naruto.

20
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,237
{\an7}Flowers often have
symbolic meaning, and
tulips stand for "eternal
love".

side of the village is
still intact.

23

{\an1}Great! Thanks, Shikamaru!

24

Some kind of tag?

38

00:18:28,581 --> 00:18:32,186
So you actually admit
that you killed him and
his wife, too?!

295
00:18:32,218 --> 00:18:34,154
{\an1}<i>Who are you, brat?! </i>

296
00:18:34,188 --> 00:18:35,755
{\an1}Answer the question!

297
00:18:35,788 --> 00:18:37,590
{\an1}And so what if I did!

298
00:18:37,623 --> 00:18:39,459
{\an1}Then you'll pay!

299
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:43,362
{\an1}Looks like you were
right about everything,
Naruto...

300
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,231
{\an1}Release!

301
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,702
<i>Kakashi?! </i>

302
00:18:49,736 --> 00:18:53,107
{\an1}Yep. And that "brat"
happens to be one of my
students.

303
00:18:53,906 --> 00:18:57,643
{\an1}Now talk. Tell us what
you planned to do after
taking control of the

304
00:18:57,677 --> 00:18:59,479
{\an1}Hidden Leaf's defense
system.

305
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:00,680
[grunting]

306
00:19:00,713 --> 00:19:02,315
{\an1}It's over, Sabiru!

307
00:19:02,348 --> 00:19:04,383
{\an1}<i>Kakashi Sensei, wait! </i>

308
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:07,687
{\an1}Mister! This is your
chance to take your
revenge!

309
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,654
{\an3}Yeah!

310
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:10,590
{\an1}Transformation Jutsu!

311
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:16,362
{\an1}Now prepare to die! Multi
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

312
00:19:18,264 --> 00:19:19,432
Let's go!

313
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,235
Sabiru!

314
00:19:22,236 --> 00:19:23,904
Now take this!

315
00:19:24,138 --> 00:19:28,008
[screaming]

316
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:43,724
What the--?

317
00:19:47,194 --> 00:19:48,896
{\an3}Hey!

318
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:50,429
[grunting]

319
00:19:50,864 --> 00:19:53,533
{\an1}What is this? Kakashi
Sensei!

320
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:56,937
{\an1}He was eliminated!

321
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:03,677
{\an4}Thank you, Naruto.
Because of you, the
Hidden Leaf is safe
again.

322
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:08,314
{\an8}I didn't do anything!
We're only safe now
because your spirit
hung around.

323
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:10,449
{\an1}Oh, don't be so modest.

324
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:14,621
{\an1}Yeah, but, Mister...

325
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:16,890
{\an1}<i>You're really dead now...</i>

326
00:20:17,157 --> 00:20:22,361
{\an1}It's okay. I can reunite
with my wife and find
happiness.

327
00:20:22,996 --> 00:20:26,066
{\an1}But I do have one favor
to ask, Naruto.

328
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,135
Sure! Anything!

329
00:20:28,168 --> 00:20:33,841
{\an4}If you should ever find
yourself thinking about
me, can you go place some
tulips on our graves for me?

330
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,276
{\an1}They were my wife's
favorite.

331
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,178
Of course!

332
00:20:39,713 --> 00:20:42,883
{\an1}Well, Naruto...
Goodbye...

333
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,652
{\an1}Live a full life for the
both of us!

334
00:20:46,385 --> 00:20:48,188
Wait, Mister!

335
00:20:48,222 --> 00:20:51,425
{\an1}Okay! I will, Kisuke!

336
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,860
{\an1}Goodbye!

337
00:22:57,718 --> 00:23:00,722
{\an1}<i>What is this?! Sasuke,</i>
<i>what is going on? </i>

338
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:03,657
{\an1}<i>How should I know?</i>
<i>Besides, whose fault do</i>
<i>you think it is that</i>

339
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,659
<i>we're in this</i>
<i>situation in the</i>
<i>first place?!</i>

340
00:23:05,692 --> 00:23:08,963
{\an1}<i>You're one to talk!</i>
<i>It's your fault</i>
<i>Sakura got captured!</i>

341
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:13,567
{\an4}<i>Quiet! The longer we</i>
<i>argue, the less of a</i>
<i>chance Sakura has of</i>
<i>surviving! </i>

342
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,903
{\an1}<i>But how can we do</i>
<i>anything like this?! </i>

343
00:23:16,371 --> 00:23:21,142
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden, The Worst</i>
<i>Three-Legged Race.</i>

344
00:23:21,175 --> 00:23:23,444
{\an1}<i>Nothing good ever happens</i>
<i>when you're around. </i>
