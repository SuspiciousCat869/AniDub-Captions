{\an8}Naturally, relations
became strained and the
threat of war loomed.

154
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:17,520
{\an1}In order to prevent further
fighting, he Leaf secretly
talked with the Cloud

155
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:22,557
{\an1}and accepted their terms.
Because... that was their
only choice...

156
00:11:22,591 --> 00:11:25,093
{\an1}What were the terms that
the Leaf agreed to?

157
00:11:25,127 --> 00:11:29,698
{\an7}The Hyuga leader who possessed
the Kekkei Genkai, Byakugan.

158
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:35,970
{\an7}<i>In other words, they demanded</i>
<i>the Leaf hand over the corpse of</i>
<i>Lady Hinata's father, Hiashi</i>
<i>Hyuga. </i>

159
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:42,209
{\an7}<i>And so, Hiashi's younger twin,</i>

<i>his stand-in...</i>

160
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:46,314
{\an7}...and because of that,
peace between the villages
was maintained.

161

166

to be dead, How did-?

168
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:22,414
{\an1}Yes. At first, I didn't
understand it all, either.

169
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:27,886
{\an1}After a long slumber, I
awoke, and found myself in
a certain hideout.

170
00:12:28,987 --> 00:12:33,925
{\an1}Hizashi, you've been revived
thanks to my Reanimation Jutsu.

171
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:40,264
{\an1}Although... it was also because
your heart still has attachments
to this world.

172
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:43,434
I have no attachments.
I wanted to die for-

wish to give up your life...

175

{\an1}But what if you knew that
your death was in vain...?

176
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:59,784
{\an1}Perhaps that man was right... I
did feel that way at the time.

177
00:13:02,185 --> 00:13:04,856
{\an1}And that's why I planned
this course of action.

00:13:04,888 --> 00:13:08,525
{\an1}<i>(Hizashi)</i>

180
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:17,467

181
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,470
{\an1}<i>Well, all that</i>
<i>doesn't matter now...</i>

182
00:13:20,504 --> 00:13:24,140
{\an1}I'm a man who simply shouldn't
exist in this world any longer.

183
00:13:24,173 --> 00:13:28,344
{\an1}However, it seems it's
impossible for me to undo
this jutsu myself.

184
00:13:28,377 --> 00:13:32,448
{\an1}Please, return to the
village and find out how
to release this jutsu.

185
00:13:32,481 --> 00:13:39,355
{\an1}But before that, I would ...like
to take a moment to speak with
my son Neji, alone.

186
00:13:57,739 --> 00:14:01,609
{\an1}Neji, do you remember
that fateful day?

187
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:07,981
{\an1}Neji, you must survive.

188
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:13,153
{\an1}You've been gifted with the
Hyuga's abilities more than any
other member in our clan.

189
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:19,893
{\an1}I should have been born a few
moments earlier, and made you
part of the main household.

190
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:24,665
{\an1}Even though I did what I did in
order to protect the village,
our family, and you,

191
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:30,436
{\an4}I'm sorry to say that defying
the fate of the Hyuga appears to
have brought you nothing but
sadness.

192
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:36,642
{\an1}On top of that, I was worried
about your future, tied as it
was to the destiny of the Hyuga.

193
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:39,979
{\an1}Yes... It was only
natural, having lost you,

194
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:44,250
{\an1}I used that as motivation
to resent and curse my
destiny as a Hyuga.

come; maybe I'll just end
up in the same place.

life.
