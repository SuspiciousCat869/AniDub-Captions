1
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,091
{\an1}The Ten Tails vanished?!

2
00:02:14,595 --> 00:02:16,096
{\an1}What's going on up there?

3
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:17,330
{\an1}Have they taken it down?

4
00:02:17,664 --> 00:02:18,531
No...

5
00:02:18,832 --> 00:02:19,631
Hinata!

6
00:02:19,665 --> 00:02:20,833
Did you see it?

7
00:02:20,865 --> 00:02:21,999
Yeah...

8
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:24,836
{\an1}Can you explain what
exactly happened?!

9
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:04,663
{\an1}The Ten Tails has
been completely

10
00:03:04,697 --> 00:03:06,431
{\an1}absorbed into that man.

11
00:03:07,465 --> 00:03:08,733
{\an1}Based on its chakra.

12
00:03:10,534 --> 00:03:12,201
Don't tell me.

13
00:03:25,244 --> 00:03:27,579
That guy is Ten
Tails' Jinchuriki?!

14
00:03:37,653 --> 00:03:39,120
{\an1}What's this I feel?

15
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,055
Jinchuriki, huh?

16
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:44,991
This is bad.

17
00:03:56,766 --> 00:03:58,966
He looks even
creepier than he did before!

18
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:01,202
Obito...

19
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:04,738
{\an1}Naruto, how can you
tell he's a Jinchuriki?

20
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:08,140
{\an1}I made friends with
the other Tailed Beasts.

21
00:04:08,474 --> 00:04:11,209
{\an1}Earlier, they all gave me
some of their chakra,

22
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:12,744
{\an1}so I can totally feel it.

23
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:15,846
{\an1}I felt the Tailed Beasts'
chakra get sucked inside

24
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,380
{\an1}Obito one after another.

25
00:04:19,415 --> 00:04:22,317
{\an1}And besides that, I saw
Nagato do that Six Paths

26
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,485
{\an1}Rebirth Jutsu before.

27
00:04:25,486 --> 00:04:27,120
{\an1}But the signs that this
guy was weaving were

28
00:04:27,153 --> 00:04:29,154
{\an1}completely different!

29
00:04:29,188 --> 00:04:32,624
{\an1}He was performing the jutsu
to become a Jinchuriki

30
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:34,325
this whole time.

31
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:36,493
I see...

32
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:46,300
Eight-o!

33
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:47,801
{\an1}Is that its final form?

34
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:50,636
No, it's not.

35
00:04:51,003 --> 00:04:53,004
{\an1}It's difficult to
explain, but that isn't it.

36
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,973
{\an1}It seems Ten Tails was
used to create a Jinchuriki

37
00:04:56,006 --> 00:04:58,309
{\an1}before it reached
its final form.

38
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:00,477
[grunt]

39
00:05:05,046 --> 00:05:07,248
{\an1}Even if you've become a
Jinchuriki, the Gracious

40
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:09,650
Deity Gates are
still in play.

41
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:15,654
Whoa!

42
00:05:15,688 --> 00:05:16,688
Awesome!

43
00:05:21,258 --> 00:05:22,593
Not quite...

44
00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:25,761
Wha-?!

45
00:06:03,521 --> 00:06:06,055
{\an1}The Sage Art Seal that
even suppressed Ten Tails.

46
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,658
Such power...

47
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:21,566
[gasp]

48
00:06:59,993 --> 00:07:01,294
No way!

49
00:07:01,327 --> 00:07:02,962
The Four Crimson
Ray Formation!

50
00:07:02,995 --> 00:07:05,864
{\an1}Is he stronger than
when he was gigantic?

51
00:07:05,897 --> 00:07:07,231
Or is it me?

52
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:09,967
{\an1}Before, it was just throwing
its brute strength around.

53
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,101
{\an1}But now, it's apparently
learned to focus it.

54
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:16,772
Everyone, keep
your guard up!

55
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:19,807
{\an1}He's made The Ten
Tails' power his own.

56
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,641
{\an1}There's not telling
what he might do!

57
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,710
{\an1}He's broken the barrier!

58
00:07:34,051 --> 00:07:35,384
Enough, Obito!

59
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:36,752
Stop this now!

60
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:41,555
O...

61
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:42,356
bi...

62
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:43,724
to...?

63
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:50,028
{\an1}Look, I'll be blunt.

64
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:52,897
This guy is
stronger than I am!

65
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,298
{\an1}No offense intended,
but it appears to be true.

66
00:07:56,332 --> 00:07:58,601
{\an1}Even if you absorb your
remaining clones, you're no

67
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:00,301
{\an1}match, Elder Brother!

68
00:08:00,335 --> 00:08:01,869
Yes, I know.

69
00:08:01,903 --> 00:08:03,037
However...

70
00:08:20,382 --> 00:08:22,550
{\an1}Though it would be quite fun
to watch the Hokage beg for

71
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:25,987
mercy, I simply
cannot wait any longer.

72
00:08:30,023 --> 00:08:33,324
{\an1}Obito is now just like
the Sage of the Six Paths.

73
00:08:33,358 --> 00:08:35,192
I can't let him
take the lead before I

74
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:36,593
{\an1}use my trump card.

75
00:08:37,561 --> 00:08:38,562
Huh?!

76
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:54,906
What happened?

77
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:56,340
So fast!

78
00:08:56,374 --> 00:08:57,041
Fourth!

79
00:08:57,074 --> 00:08:58,042
Saru!

80
00:08:58,075 --> 00:08:58,876
Scram!

81
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,411
This is Lord
Second's attack plan!

82
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:12,618
Brother!

83
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:19,189
{\an1}Minato, get away now!

84
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,592
Lord Second, you
sure work fast!

85
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:23,393
{\an1}Flying Raijin Jutsu!

86
00:09:24,861 --> 00:09:27,228
{\an1}I suspected that might
not be enough to kill you.

87
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:30,431
I created the
Reanimation Jutsu,

88
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:31,899
{\an1}and its ancillary jutsu.

89
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:36,635
{\an1}Though it's the first
time I'm using it on myself.

90
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:41,005
Here it comes!

91
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,774
{\an1}Lord Second's special,
Tandem Explosive Tags!

92
00:09:44,607 --> 00:09:46,742
{\an1}And this is how it's done!

93
00:09:47,977 --> 00:09:50,244
{\an1}Each tag summons more tags,
resulting in concentrated

94
00:09:50,277 --> 00:09:53,179
and focused
consecutive explosions!

95
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,821
[grunt]

96
00:10:04,822 --> 00:10:05,989
{\an1}This is way too much!

97
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:06,823
What's going on?

98
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,223
I can't keep up!

99
00:10:08,557 --> 00:10:09,591
{\an1}Now don't freak out!

100
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,626
Always watch
what's happening!

101
00:10:19,765 --> 00:10:21,100
I don't care if
that's The Ten Tails'

102
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:22,600
{\an1}Jinchuriki or whatever!

103
00:10:22,634 --> 00:10:24,969
{\an1}Our Lords Hokage are
engaged in battle!

104
00:10:25,003 --> 00:10:25,969
Let's join them!

105
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:26,970
Don't be hasty!

106
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:28,138
{\an1}We need to take our-!

107
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:29,272
All of you!

108
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:31,540
You must not
approach him carelessly!

109
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,626
Damn it!
What is he?!

110
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:28,346
{\an1}He's solid and swift.

111
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:31,448
{\an1}And has an attack that turns
all to dust in an instant!

112
00:11:39,386 --> 00:11:41,088
{\an1}Shuriken Shadow Clones!

113
00:11:51,195 --> 00:11:53,663
{\an1}It's like Ohnoki's Particle
Style, but can change

114
00:11:53,697 --> 00:11:56,199
{\an1}shape, be offensive or
defensive, and be

115
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:58,266
{\an1}continuously maintained.

116
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,338
{\an1}I suspect it's a combination
of more than four Changes in

117
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:06,939
Chakra Nature!

118
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:10,742
{\an1}This is more than a Kekkei
Genkai or even a Kekkei

119
00:12:10,776 --> 00:12:11,977
Touta...

120
00:12:15,512 --> 00:12:18,447
{\an1}But there seems to be
a time limit to how long

121
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,183
{\an1}he can use each one.

122
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:28,188
Gramps, no!

123
00:12:28,521 --> 00:12:29,688
Hey, Dad!

124
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:31,157
{\an1}You couldn't teleport
Grandpa Third

125
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,891
{\an1}with your jutsu, too?

126
00:12:33,558 --> 00:12:34,592
I couldn't.

127
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:36,393
{\an1}I simply can't teleport
anything that I myself, or

128
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:39,096
my chakra, isn't
touching directly.

129
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:40,863
{\an1}Calm down, Naruto.

130
00:12:40,897 --> 00:12:42,931
The Hokage are
Reanimations.

131
00:12:42,964 --> 00:12:45,666
{\an1}They intentionally attacked
head-on, knowing full well

132
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:49,270
{\an1}they wouldn't die to
assess the enemy's powers.

133
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:52,038
{\an1}Stop worrying and
analyze the battle instead.

134
00:12:54,072 --> 00:12:55,174
That's Sasuke.

135
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,374
He's bright.

136
00:12:56,407 --> 00:12:59,243
{\an1}But it still takes a little
while for a Reanimation

137
00:12:59,277 --> 00:13:00,777
to regenerate.

138
00:13:07,581 --> 00:13:09,316
{\an1}I'll go first and
create an opening!

139
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:12,451
At this point, I
feel the need to.

140
00:13:19,023 --> 00:13:20,191
{\an1}I'm done waiting!

141
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:22,059
{\an1}Let's go, Hashirama!

142
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,746
Wh- What the-?!

143
00:13:59,985 --> 00:14:02,453
{\an1}I see, Ten Tails hasn't
completely synched

144
00:14:02,486 --> 00:14:04,255
{\an1}with its Jinchuriki yet.

145
00:14:04,888 --> 00:14:06,522
{\an1}This is our chance
to take it down!

146
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,958
I'll summon my
original here, then!

147
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,694
{\an1}It's been a while, but
time for my Rasen-Flash

148
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,962
{\an1}Super-Circle Dance
Howl Stage Three!

149
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:22,801
[gasp]

150
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:23,601
Gamakichi!

151
00:14:23,634 --> 00:14:24,835
Below!

152
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:36,443
{\an1}He passed underground!

153
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:37,844
{\an1}But just his upper body!

154
00:14:52,721 --> 00:14:53,755
Damn it!

155
00:15:06,597 --> 00:15:07,832
Sasuke...

156
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:17,306
{\an1}You're not the one...

157
00:15:22,242 --> 00:15:23,442
{\an1}...who will sever the past.

158
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:24,777
I am!

159
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:26,811
[gasp]

160
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,449
Be in time!

161
00:15:34,784 --> 00:15:35,985
{\an1}Flying Raijin Jutsu!

162
00:15:36,818 --> 00:15:38,719
My markings on
Obito disappeared?!

163
00:15:43,023 --> 00:15:44,423
Damn it!

164
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:01,769
I really thought
we were done for!

165
00:16:02,937 --> 00:16:05,005
{\an1}I simply can't teleport
anything that I myself, or

166
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:07,006
my chakra, isn't
touching directly.

167
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:12,210
[chuckle]

168
00:16:12,244 --> 00:16:14,444
{\an1}Looks like my kid is as
accomplished as Sasuke.

169
00:16:16,314 --> 00:16:17,314
Now, then...

170
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,354
{\an1}He's just like a snake!

171
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:39,330
What is that?!

172
00:16:39,363 --> 00:16:40,897
{\an1}We have to take him down
while he's still unable to

173
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,631
{\an1}use his body well.

174
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,222
{\an1}Was he after your
clone just now, Dad?

175
00:17:17,255 --> 00:17:18,155
No.

176
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,657
{\an1}I don't think that's
what he's going for.

177
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:34,667
Hold on.

178
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:36,168
{\an1}What just happened?!

179
00:17:36,835 --> 00:17:38,837
He hit himself
with his own attack.

180
00:17:39,603 --> 00:17:41,005
His attack
missed its target.

181
00:17:41,739 --> 00:17:44,640
{\an1}Seems Obito's consciousness
is merely clinging on to The

182
00:17:44,674 --> 00:17:46,242
{\an1}Ten Tails' great power.

183
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:48,410
He barely has
any control of it.

184
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,745
{\an1}Well, I'm certainly glad
he missed us because

185
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,047
{\an1}otherwise, we'd be dead!

186
00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:55,915
We can't
carelessly approach him!

187
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,283
{\an1}Now I'll get in the
Rasen-Flash Super-Circle

188
00:17:58,317 --> 00:18:00,085
{\an1}Dance Howl Stage Three!

189
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:02,086
{\an1}I'll create an opening.

190
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,488
Then you two
immediately hit him with

191
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,888
{\an1}your strongest combo!

192
00:18:07,123 --> 00:18:08,324
{\an1}Rin- [discomforted yell]

193
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:12,961
[screaming]

194
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:16,996
Of course I'm
gonna become Hokage!

195
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:20,799
Rin!

196
00:18:30,672 --> 00:18:31,539
Then...

197
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,542
{\an1}I'm not gonna have any
time for girls at all!

198
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:36,411
{\an1}Am I right, Sensei?

199
00:18:50,987 --> 00:18:52,854
[screaming]

200
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:15,204
{\an1}Here I come, Obito!

201
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,774
Who are you?

202
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:28,146
[screaming]

203
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:25,319
{\an1}It's about time, Sensei.

204
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,927
Damn it!

205
00:20:40,629 --> 00:20:41,930
Dad, no!

206
00:20:41,964 --> 00:20:43,065
Naruto, focus!

207
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,234
{\an1}He may have gotten
me, but I'm still okay!

208
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:48,668
I escaped with
Flying Raijin.

209
00:20:50,003 --> 00:20:51,170
Are you sure?

210
00:20:53,272 --> 00:20:54,540
When did he?!

211
00:20:54,873 --> 00:20:56,508
{\an1}Ah, he attached it to
me so it would teleport

212
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,008
along with me!

213
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,559
{\an1}<i>Even a small power can</i>
<i>be helpful, depending</i>

214
00:22:58,593 --> 00:23:00,060
{\an1}<i>on how it's used.</i>

215
00:23:00,093 --> 00:23:02,629
{\an1}<i>There might come a time</i>
<i>when we'll be needed.</i>

216
00:23:02,662 --> 00:23:05,664
{\an1}<i>Our power could change</i>
<i>the course of this world.</i>

217
00:23:05,698 --> 00:23:08,366
{\an1}<i>We can't afford to relax</i>
<i>and let our guard down,</i>

218
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:10,100
{\an1}<i>even for one second!</i>

219
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,103
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "An Opening."</i>

220
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:19,206
{\an1}<i>Shikamaru, you would</i>
