1
00:00:13,843 --> 00:00:17,347
{\an1}Why you...
You whelp!

2
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,315
{\an1}How dare you!

3
00:00:34,363 --> 00:00:35,931
What the hell?!

4
00:00:35,964 --> 00:00:39,134
(screaming)

5
00:00:44,705 --> 00:00:47,808
{\an1}Hey, hey, hey...
No way...
That's...

6
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,714
{\an7}How dare you do such
a thing to Ginkaku?!
You're going to pay!

7
00:00:57,952 --> 00:01:01,821
{\an1}Now he looks...
just like the Nine
Tail's Jinchuriki!

8
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:17,404
What is...
that thing?!

9
00:01:17,437 --> 00:01:19,005
{\an1}There's still
more?!

10
00:01:34,687 --> 00:01:38,923
{\an7}It's been quite a
while since I've seen
that happen to Kinkaku.

11
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:42,528
{\an7}That means...
Ginkaku's a goner.

12
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:52,237
{\an1}Ahhhh!

13
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,707
{\an4}The red and blue
balance of your Tailed
Beast chakra looks
good to go!

14
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:57,375
{\an1}So do it, Naruto!

15
00:01:58,042 --> 00:02:00,844
{\an1}Here I go!
Tailed Beast
Rasan-

16
00:02:04,114 --> 00:02:05,617
{\an1}Concentrate!

17
00:02:09,953 --> 00:02:11,755
{\an1}Didn't work, huh?

18
00:02:12,356 --> 00:02:15,425
{\an7}<i>That time you were</i>
<i>so close, it's too bad.</i>

19
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:18,662
{\an1}Why'd you lose your
focus?! It's so sad!

20
00:02:21,998 --> 00:02:25,067
{\an8}<i>What the hell was</i>
<i>that just now?</i>

21
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:19,877
{\an8}Oh man, this is
really not good.

22
00:04:22,246 --> 00:04:25,649
{\an7}(Chuckle)
I'm really sorry!

23
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,319
{\an1}Too late for that!

24
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:29,152
{\an3}Whoa!

25
00:04:35,258 --> 00:04:39,429
{\an8}What? What's
that? Is he
a Jinchuriki?

26
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:44,100
{\an1}Thanks. I sure do
owe you one. But still,
just what is that thing?!

27
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,836
{\an7}<i>Now that we're allies...</i>

28
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,039
{\an1}I believe it's about
time that you knew
the whole story!

29
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:58,414
{\an7}<i>Long before Madara</i>
<i>Uchiha tamed the Nine</i>
<i>Tails, the Hidden Cloud</i>
<i>put together a mission</i>

30
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:01,784
{\an7}<i>to try to capture</i>
<i>that cataclysmic</i>
<i>force!</i>

31
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:06,921
{\an1}<i>That's when the Nine</i>
<i>Tails devoured Lords</i>
<i>Kinkaku and Ginkaku.</i>

32
00:05:07,456 --> 00:05:11,794
{\an1}<i>And then after two</i>
<i>weeks, he expelled them!</i>

33
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:16,598
What? Expelled them?
You mean from his
behind?

34
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:19,634
{\an1}Come on, show some
respect, and contact
HQ immediately!

35
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,402
{\an1}We need to know how
to counter that!

36
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:22,637
Right! Sure!

37
00:05:26,474 --> 00:05:31,111
{\an4}Where are the
reinforcements?!
And what's the status
of Darui's First Company?

38
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:36,249
They've caught
Ginkaku, one of the
enemy's strongmen.

39
00:05:36,283 --> 00:05:39,921
{\an4}But it seems Kinkaku
has donned the Nine
Tails Cloak and is
running amok!

40
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,323
{\an8}The time's come,
Mabui! Start
preparations!

41
00:05:43,356 --> 00:05:44,224
{\an1}Right!

42
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:47,960
<i>If Kinkaku has</i>
<i>transformed, we</i>
<i>can't stop him!</i>

43
00:05:47,993 --> 00:05:51,898
{\an4}He has a Nine
Tails' Cloak?!
Even if he does
possess the Nine

44
00:05:51,932 --> 00:05:56,135
{\an4}Tails' chakra, how
can he undergo
Tailed Beast
transformation?

45
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,172
{\an1}They were inside of
the Nine Tails' for
two weeks.

46
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:04,844
{\an4}And supposedly they
survived by eating
the Nine Tails'
stomach lining.

47
00:06:04,877 --> 00:06:09,080
{\an1}No one else has ever
eaten the Nine Tails'
Chakra rich flesh.

48
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:12,651
<i>No...actually, I</i>
<i>take that back.</i>

49
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:19,257
{\an5}I've heard that some
in the Cloud tried to
copy feat by eating
Eight Tails' legs.

50
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,727
But they all died
without becoming
Jinchuriki.

51
00:06:23,294 --> 00:06:29,767
{\an4}<i>Those two brothers are</i>
<i>special. Perhaps they're</i>
<i>direct descendants of the</i>
<i>Sage of the Six Paths.</i>

52
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:32,770
{\an1}All right, so what
do we have to do to
take him down?

53
00:06:32,804 --> 00:06:34,672
<i>There is only</i>
<i>one way.</i>

54
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,643
{\an5}It's true Kinkaku
has enormous chakra
and power, that fact's
undeniable.

55
00:06:39,677 --> 00:06:44,414
{\an5}However, we can still
use their fifth and
final Treasure Tool
against them.

56
00:06:44,448 --> 00:06:45,749
{\an1}<i>Come with me.</i>

57
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:56,927
{\an8}<i>If I could just seal</i>
<i>him away in the</i>
<i>gourd too...</i>

58
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,596
{\an7}<i>But I need Kokinjo</i>
<i>to squeeze out his</i>
<i>spirit word.</i>

59
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:05,268
{\an8}<i>And I can't see the</i>
<i>rope on his arm while</i>
<i>he's covered by the</i>
<i>Nine Tails' Cloak.</i>

60
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:07,770
{\an7}<i>I can't get it...</i>

61
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:14,075
{\an5}Sir, a message!
HQ's sending you the
Kohaku no Johei, the
Amber Purification Jar.

62
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:17,245
{\an1}I see! Thank you.

63
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,048
{\an7}It'll be way better
than this gourd.

64
00:07:20,348 --> 00:07:26,388
{\an4}<i>This is the Kohaku no</i>
<i>Johei, one of the five</i>
<i>Treasured Tools. It was</i>
<i>used to seal away</i>

65
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:27,656
{\an1}<i>the Eight Tails.</i>

66
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:30,191
It doesn't seem like
anything special.

67
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:35,030
{\an4}You don't need the
other tools for it to
work. All you do is
say the target's name,

68
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:39,300
{\an4}and if they respond,
their voice is
recorded and they're
trapped inside.

69
00:07:40,035 --> 00:07:42,871
{\an4}It's all we can
take from the
Gold and Silver
Brothers.

70
00:07:42,904 --> 00:07:45,739
{\an1}We'll send it to
Darui so he can
seal Kinkaku!

71
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:50,210
But the situation is
urgent! It'll take too
long to transport this.

72
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:51,512
{\an8}<i>Lord Raikage...</i>

73
00:07:51,712 --> 00:07:55,114
{\an1}Everything's ready!
I can send it to
Darui now!

74
00:07:55,716 --> 00:08:00,754
{\an5}Mabui's jutsu is
object teleportation,
which moves at the
speed of light.

75
00:08:00,788 --> 00:08:02,756
It's the reason why
she's my secretary.

76
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,660
{\an4}But if that used to be
one of their ninja tools,
I'm sure he knows how to
counter it, as well.

77
00:08:07,694 --> 00:08:11,397
{\an1}So we need to figure
out the best way
to make him respond.

78
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:16,603
{\an1}Right. I've got an
idea to try...

79
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,340
{\an1}Any strategy that you
come up with is sure
to work. You handle it.

80
00:08:21,373 --> 00:08:22,641
{\an1}Go on, Mabui!

81
00:08:22,674 --> 00:08:24,911
Ethereal
Transmission
Jutsu!

82
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,349
<i>Make sure you</i>
<i>get him, Darui.</i>

83
00:08:35,587 --> 00:08:39,625
{\an4}We've both got
exceptional
subordinates, don't
we, Tsunade?

84
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:41,525
You got that right.

85
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:46,597
(painful grunt)

86
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:47,765
Here it is!

87
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:56,172
{\an7}<i>The Kohaku no Johei...</i>
<i>That used to be ours!</i>

88
00:08:56,206 --> 00:09:00,811
{\an1}I see. They're going
to try to seal me
away, are they?

89
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:08,119
{\an8}<i>I'm glad we have this.</i>
<i>But Kinkaku knows how</i>
<i>this tool works. How am</i>
<i>I supposed to seal him</i>

90
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:10,021
{\an8}<i>if he knows all</i>
<i>its tricks?</i>

91
00:09:10,987 --> 00:09:16,726
{\an7}<i>Well, HQ came up with</i>
<i>a strategy. Until I</i>
<i>know what it is, I'll</i>
<i>just keep this safe!</i>

92
00:09:23,298 --> 00:09:27,302
{\an1}Sorry about that, but
I can't afford to
let you catch me.

93
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,611
Fire Style Squad!
Protect Darui!
Now!

94
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:37,245
Let's go!

95
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,986
(screaming)

96
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:45,687
{\an1}Water Style Squad!

97
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,929
{\an1}You weaklings!

98
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:02,335
{\an1}Earth Style Squad!

99
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,610
{\an1}I'm sorry about this...

100
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,816
{\an1}Double Black Panthers!

101
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,929
{\an1}Do you think
we did it?!

102
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:32,431
(gasp)

103
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:36,001
(screaming)

104
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,871
Ahh!

105
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,974
{\an1}I'll tear you
apart!

106
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:48,848
(screaming)

107
00:10:58,823 --> 00:11:01,226
{\an7}<i>They were all</i>
<i>taken down...</i>

108
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:06,030
{\an7}<i>...by one man?</i>

109
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:12,302
{\an7}<i>A barrage of Fire,</i>
<i>Water, Earth and</i>
<i>Lightning Styles had</i>
<i>no effect...</i>

110
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:21,178
{\an7}<i>I'm so sorry,</i>
<i>everyone...</i>

111
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:30,954
Shikaku, I can't
hold this jutsu
for long.

112
00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:33,589
{\an1}I know, let's
do this.

113
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:40,463
{\an7}<i>Darui...</i>

114
00:11:40,496 --> 00:11:43,599
{\an7}<i>It's Shikaku from</i>
<i>Headquarters!</i>
<i>Listen up...</i>

115
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:45,600
{\an8}<i>I've been waiting</i>
<i>to hear from you...</i>

116
00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:48,303
{\an7}<i>You have the Kohaku</i>
<i>no Johei, right?</i>

117
00:11:48,336 --> 00:11:53,909
{\an7}<i>For this plan to be</i>
<i>successful, the Ino-</i>
<i>Shika-Cho Formation is</i>
<i>absolutely critical.</i>

118
00:11:53,942 --> 00:11:56,945
{\an7}<i>Please, hold on</i>
<i>until we get there.</i>

119
00:11:56,978 --> 00:12:02,184
{\an8}<i>Ino-Shika-Cho?</i>
<i>But Shikaku and</i>
<i>Inoichi are still</i>
<i>at HQ.</i>

120
00:12:02,217 --> 00:12:06,121
{\an8}<i>They're so far</i>
<i>away, and we've</i>
<i>lost so many men</i>
<i>already...</i>

121
00:12:06,988 --> 00:12:09,891
{\an8}<i>Holding it on is</i>
<i>such a tall order.</i>

122
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:13,961
{\an8}<i>Where'd he go?</i>

123
00:12:22,303 --> 00:12:23,671
(forceful grunt)

124
00:12:26,674 --> 00:12:28,108
{\an1}Kikuchi, sir!

125
00:12:28,142 --> 00:12:29,944
Sorry I'm late!

126
00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:34,814
Reinforcements!

127
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:36,416
{\an7}We've been waiting!

128
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:41,054
{\an7}Now we can keep
on fighting!

129
00:12:45,424 --> 00:12:47,660
{\an8}HQ has a plan.

130
00:12:47,894 --> 00:12:51,097
{\an8}We'll strike at
Kinkaku with the
Ino-Shika-Cho
Formation.

131
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,367
{\an8}<i>Until they get here,</i>

{\an1}(cheering support)

133
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:06,745
{\an4}They're on their way
right now? Then there's
no way we'll fail
to hold this line!

134
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:11,816
{\an8}<i>Shikamaru, Choji,</i>
<i>Ino, listen up!</i>

137
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,763
{\an8}I see...
So that's the
plan, huh?

138
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:27,765
{\an8}I understand.

139
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:33,938
{\an7}<i>So we're supposed to</i>
<i>fight this legendary</i>
<i>monster Kinkaku who</i>
<i>nearly killed the</i>

140
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:38,209
{\an7}<i>Second Hokage!</i>
<i>Things are becoming</i>
<i>a real drag.</i>

141
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:40,677
{\an8}<i>Oh, man! I'm</i>
<i>getting scared.</i>

142
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:44,047
{\an7}Hold on! You boys
better not wimp
out on me.

143
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:49,618
{\an7}<i>Legends become</i>
<i>exaggerated over</i>
<i>time. And when an</i>
<i>old legend is</i>

144
00:13:49,652 --> 00:13:52,655
{\an7}surpassed, new
legends are born!

145
00:13:58,928 --> 00:14:06,068
{\an8}<i>He may have the</i>
<i>Nine Tails' power, but</i>
<i>we have the power of</i>
<i>the Ino-Shika-Cho bond.</i>

146
00:14:06,502 --> 00:14:11,240
{\an8}<i>The teamwork ninjutsu</i>
<i>of Ino-Shika-Cho is</i>
<i>one of the most</i>
<i>celebrated legends in</i>

147
00:14:11,273 --> 00:14:15,344
{\an8}<i>and of itself! Have</i>
<i>confidence and pride</i>
<i>in that!</i>

148
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:20,282
{\an7}Don't back down!

149
00:14:20,548 --> 00:14:22,517
We must hold the line,
no matter what!

150
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:33,328
More reinforcements!

151
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,468
Sorry we're late!

152
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:43,371
So that's him?

153
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:46,173
{\an7}<i>How could he</i>
<i>do all of this?</i>

154
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:49,810
Huh?

155
00:14:49,843 --> 00:14:50,944
{\an8}Reinforcements!

156
00:14:50,978 --> 00:14:53,746
{\an7}The Second Company
and the Fourth
Company's here!

157
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:57,783
{\an4}So, uh, do you get
the feeling there's
a lot of hope
riding on us now?

158
00:14:57,817 --> 00:15:00,253
{\an1}That's the kind
of people we've
become?

159
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:02,588
It's making me
kinda nervous,
though...

160
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:06,258
{\an8}Well I guess we're
just gonna have to
live up to their
expectations!

161
00:15:07,026 --> 00:15:11,097
{\an4}Hey, wait! They're
just the kids! Not
the real Ino-Shika-
Cho!

162
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,099
{\an1}(disappointed groans)

163
00:15:13,366 --> 00:15:16,335
{\an1}Yeah... I kinda
figured they might
say that.

164
00:15:16,369 --> 00:15:17,902
I did too...

165
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:21,407
{\an5}Hey, come on now!
We're gonna start a
legend of our very
own, right here!

166
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:23,608
So let's get
going, guys!

167
00:15:23,641 --> 00:15:25,510
Yeah, I
heard that.

168
00:15:25,543 --> 00:15:26,945
{\an1}Mmm-hmm!

169
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:29,247
{\an1}Everyone, cover them!

170
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,151
{\an1}(fighting grunts)

171
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:38,822
{\an1}All of you are
merely third-rate
underlings!

172
00:15:45,896 --> 00:15:48,065
Come on...

173
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:52,870
{\an1}You're wimps. As
if you could bring
me down.

174
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:56,073
{\an7}<i>Human Boulder!</i>

175
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,209
{\an1}Why you!

176
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:04,814
{\an1}Ahh!

177
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:10,620
Shadow Possession
complete!

178
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:15,825
{\an1}One petty trick
after another!

179
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:19,228
{\an8}<i>Ugh! He's got a</i>
<i>lot of power!</i>

180
00:16:19,262 --> 00:16:23,366
{\an1}Ha! This is nothing!
I can break this!

181
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:27,803
He broke the
Shadow Possession!

182
00:16:27,836 --> 00:16:29,938
{\an1}Die!

183
00:16:33,842 --> 00:16:36,644
{\an7}Now that was
excellent timing.

184
00:16:39,514 --> 00:16:42,616
{\an1}Whew, I got him!
Mind Transfer
Jutsu complete!

185
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,519
All right!
Kinkaku!

186
00:16:44,785 --> 00:16:45,686
{\an1}Yes!

187
00:16:58,265 --> 00:16:59,799
Ahh!

188
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:02,136
{\an1}Come back,
Ino! Now!

189
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:11,878
{\an4}I can't believe
that we... touted
as the shining
light of the Cloud

190
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:14,814
{\an1}...could be taken
down by the likes
of them!

191
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:21,554
{\an5}Gold and silver coins
may be much shinier
and worth more than
bronze coins are.

192
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:25,724
{\an5}<i>But pool them, and</i>
<i>bronze coins are</i>
<i>worth more than gold</i>
<i>or silver alone.</i>

193
00:17:26,426 --> 00:17:31,330
<i>You may be gold, but</i>
<i>it seems that you</i>
<i>were only fool's gold.</i>

194
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,833
And that's why
we defeated you.

195
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:40,072
{\an5}<i>Sorry, but I told</i>
<i>you I was going to</i>
<i>strip away your gold</i>
<i>coating.</i>

196
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:46,245
{\an1}Ino!

197
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:50,314
{\an1}Choji!

198
00:17:57,889 --> 00:17:59,457
(coughing)

199
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,560
{\an8}For being afraid,
you did really well,
Choji!

200
00:18:02,593 --> 00:18:05,962
I think I must have
sweated off fifty
pounds from all that.

201
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:10,601
{\an7}Well, if that's all,
then you're fine. You
look exactly the same
to me, Choji!

202
00:18:10,635 --> 00:18:12,736
{\an8}<i>It all went</i>
<i>as planned!</i>

203
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:14,037
(chuckle)

204
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,273
{\an1}<i>Good work, Choji!</i>

205
00:18:16,306 --> 00:18:18,508
(giggle)

206
00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:23,346
{\an8}<i>Ino, you've gotten much</i>
<i>better at your speed and</i>
<i>with your control over</i>
<i>the Mind Transfer.</i>

207
00:18:24,347 --> 00:18:29,486
{\an5}Units Six through Ten,
you help the injured
get to the rear! And the
rest of you, follow me!

208
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,590
(cheering)

209
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:43,666
{\an7}<i>I sealed away Kokinjo,</i>
<i>the rope that squeezes</i>
<i>out Spirit Words,</i>
<i>along with Kinkaku...</i>

210
00:18:43,698 --> 00:18:49,938
{\an7}<i>So we can't use the</i>
<i>other two ninja tools.</i>
<i>But, where'd the</i>
<i>Bashosen fan go?</i>

211
00:18:56,811 --> 00:18:59,380
Choji, Ino, Let's go!

212
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:00,481
{\an1}Already?

213
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:01,848
{\an7}C'mon, get up!

214
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,252
{\an1}(fighting grunts)

215
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:13,994
{\an1}Agh!

216
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,862
{\an1}It's him!

217
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:24,538
Long time no see,
Ino-Shika-Cho brats!

218
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:27,641
{\an7}If I remember
correctly, you're
Kakuzu...

219
00:19:27,674 --> 00:19:30,243
{\an1}We took the Kin.

220
00:19:30,276 --> 00:19:34,046
{\an4}The Gold Shogi
General is ours.
And we know
the moves...

221
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,416
{\an1}Of Kaku the bishop.
<i>You're good, so</i>
<i>we'll attack.</i>

222
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:42,188
{\an8}The brat who uses
shadows. Your being
here means only one
thing...

223
00:19:42,221 --> 00:19:44,956
{\an8}You must have
taken down Hidan.

224
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,427
{\an1}<i>Did he get his head</i>
<i>chopped off again</i>
<i>while he was praying?</i>

225
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:54,766
{\an8}<i>Or since he's not</i>
<i>here, does that mean</i>
<i>he's still alive out</i>
<i>there somewhere?</i>

226
00:19:55,267 --> 00:19:57,869
Who even cares if
he's dead or alive?!

227
00:19:58,103 --> 00:20:03,642
{\an4}Hmph! So I'm on
defense with no rook
and my gold and silver
general's taken?

228
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:10,382
{\an1}And this one
makes it five...

229
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,351
{\an7}<i>Wait, that's right.</i>

230
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:17,788
If he's got five
hearts now, we gotta
stop him five times.

231
00:20:17,821 --> 00:20:19,690
Yeah, you're
right about that.

232
00:20:19,723 --> 00:20:23,893
{\an1}<i>I think it's time</i>
<i>to start the game</i>
<i>in Kaku mode.</i>

233
00:20:25,962 --> 00:20:29,733
(painful grunts)

234
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:37,573
{\an8}Hmph! By the
way...

235
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:42,278
{\an8}<i>We've got our own</i>
<i>gold and silver shogi</i>
<i>pieces taken from</i>
<i>your side, too.</i>

236
00:20:42,312 --> 00:20:44,747
{\an8}<i>Don't you want</i>
<i>to know who</i>
<i>they are?</i>

237
00:20:48,751 --> 00:20:53,155
{\an8}<i>Lady Tsunade's</i>
<i>love, Dan Kato!</i>

238
00:20:53,188 --> 00:20:55,023
{\an8}And also...

239
00:21:09,837 --> 00:21:15,943
{\an8}<i>Your former teacher,</i>
<i>son of the Third</i>
<i>Hokage, Asuma Sarutobi!</i>

240
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:16,510
(gasps)

241
00:21:16,545 --> 00:21:18,279
{\an1}Asuma Sensei!

242
00:22:57,607 --> 00:23:02,711
{\an7}<i>The next episode is</i>
<i>a special one! Sakura</i>
<i>suddenly comes falling</i>
<i>out of the sky!</i>

243
00:23:02,746 --> 00:23:05,648
{\an7}<i>The shock of a</i>
<i>hard landing causes</i>
<i>her to lose her</i>
<i>memory!</i>

244
00:23:05,882 --> 00:23:10,119
{\an7}<i>Everyone in the</i>
<i>village lends a hand</i>
<i>to help her regain her</i>
<i>memories, but...</i>

245
00:23:10,152 --> 00:23:13,522
{\an7}<i>Just what in the</i>
<i>world is going on</i>
<i>here, anyway!</i>

246
00:23:14,022 --> 00:23:18,661
{\an7}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: Road to Sakura.</i>

247
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,831
{\an7}<i>I wonder if I'm</i>
<i>even in this one?!</i>
