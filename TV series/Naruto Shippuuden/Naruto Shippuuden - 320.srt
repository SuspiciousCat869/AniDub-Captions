1
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:56,012
What was that?!

2
00:01:56,045 --> 00:01:59,045
{\an1}Did you say that Omoi
deserted the battlefield?!

3
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,180
{\an1}Is this true, Kakashi?

4
00:02:02,013 --> 00:02:07,480
{\an4}I'm afraid it is. Reports
say he ran from his post
after stating that he needed
to leave for a bit.

5
00:02:07,513 --> 00:02:11,315
{\an1}He did?! But why?
Why would he--?!

6
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:15,048
{\an1}Omoi! Come back, my
comrade-in-arms!

7
00:02:15,749 --> 00:02:17,149
[growling]

8
00:02:17,183 --> 00:02:20,149
{\an1}Damn it, Omoi! What
were you thinking?!

9
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:24,616
{\an4}Doesn't he know our
situation?! We're strained
enough as it is! Even losing
a single man

10
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,484
{\an1}could decrease the military
strength of the unit!

11
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:32,152
{\an1}Lord Raikage, sir! You
dumb?! You buy this crap
about him deserting?!

12
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,618
Huh?! Karui?!

13
00:02:34,852 --> 00:02:38,420
{\an1}He may act a little anxious
at times, but he's
definitely not a coward!

14
00:02:38,454 --> 00:02:42,988
{\an1}He'd never just run from the
enemy. This whole thing must
be some kind of mistake!

15
00:02:43,254 --> 00:02:46,121
{\an1}Look, I don't want to
believe that he could
do this either...

16
00:02:46,154 --> 00:02:52,889
{\an4}But still, deserting under
enemy fire is a serious
offense in the Hidden
Cloud. And so...

17
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,156
{\an1}I've remembered something
that might be of help.

18
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,457
Yes, Sai?

19
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:58,523
Before Omoi left
we got a report.

20
00:02:58,557 --> 00:03:04,058
{\an4}Our unit on Battlefield
Seven was under attack.
They were requesting that
reinforcements be sent...

21
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:09,426
{\an1}<i>I saw that when he heard</i>
<i>that, Omoi went pale.</i>

22
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,959
{\an1}We received their call for
reinforcements four hours
ago.

23
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:16,927
{\an4}It appears that they were
surrounded and pinned down
by a large number of White
Zetsu.

24
00:03:17,361 --> 00:03:19,627
{\an1}There were two thousand!

25
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:21,328
Two thousand?!

26
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:25,862
{\an4}We had no forces nearby to
send to their aid, and so we
told them just to hang
tight.

27
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:27,862
We haven't heard
from them since...

28
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:31,830
{\an1}It's entirely possible that
battlefield is where Omoi
is heading.

29
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:35,597
{\an1}Who's deployed on
Battlefield Seven?

30
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,365
{\an4}The Amphibious Search and
Destroy Unit. Most of them
are from the Hidden Mist
Village.

31
00:03:39,398 --> 00:03:42,399
{\an1}Twenty-four of them were
deployed to the front.

32
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:46,266
{\an1}The Hidden Mist? Why's
Omoi so eager to help?

33
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,899
{\an1}We received another
troubling message, too.

34
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:52,633
{\an1}A supply unit that was
traveling on the road close
to Battlefield Seven...

35
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:56,235
{\an1}has yet to reach their
destination and has been
reported as missing.

36
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:59,701
{\an1}Perhaps they went to the aid
of the Amphibious Search and
Destroy Unit.

37
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:02,869
Which supply
unit is missing?

38
00:04:02,902 --> 00:04:05,602
{\an1}The Hidden Cloud's
Thundercloud Unit!

39
00:04:05,635 --> 00:04:07,070
{\an1}What did you say?!

40
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:08,570
{\an1}Thundercloud Unit?!

41
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,671
{\an1}I don't understand.
What is that unit?

42
00:04:13,038 --> 00:04:16,671
{\an1}It's a group of seven, made
up of twelve to thirteen
year-olds.

43
00:04:17,072 --> 00:04:21,106
{\an1}I realize that sounds too
young, but they're all
extremely talented.

44
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:26,440
{\an4}We decided that they were
ready to go to war, so I
assigned them to work with
the supply unit.

45
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,774
{\an1}Guess I was too hasty...

46
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:32,008
So Omoi knew all
about them correct?

47
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:36,175
{\an1}Omoi, you giant idiot.

48
00:04:36,908 --> 00:04:41,576
{\an1}Check out the chakra on
Battlefield Seven. I want to
know if that unit is alive!

49
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:44,977
White Zetsu have
overrun the area.

50
00:04:45,777 --> 00:04:48,911
{\an1}As for allied chakra, I
sense... seven.

51
00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:50,145
Seven...

52
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:54,046
The size of the
Thundercloud Unit.

53
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,879
{\an1}Please, Lord Raikage, don't!
Those kids knew what they
were signing up for!

54
00:04:57,912 --> 00:05:02,147
{\an4}They were prepared to die
on the battlefield. Don't
belittle their sacrifice
by risking others to

55
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,414
{\an1}go check on them!

56
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:05,148
Hey, those kids
are still alive.

57
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:07,115
{\an1}Damn it, Omoi, what
are you doing?!

58
00:05:07,148 --> 00:05:08,281
Omoi!

59
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:10,682
{\an1}Sorry I ran off, everyone.

60
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:15,716
{\an7}Omoi! Get back to your post!
We're at war, here! You
can't just do whatever you
want!

61
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,617
{\an7}Please, give me an hour.
That's all the time I need
to bring every one of them
back safely.

62
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:23,617
{\an7}What?! Will you just drop
all this nonsense?!

63
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,551
{\an7}<i>How can you stand there and</i>
<i>say something like that?!</i>
<i>You're the one who's always</i>
<i>worried about everything!</i>

64
00:05:28,952 --> 00:05:33,020
{\an7}Every unit is going to have
some casualties. It's just
wishful thinking to assume
that those

65
00:05:33,053 --> 00:05:35,487
{\an7}seven are all from the
Thundercloud Unit.

66
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,854
{\an7}Sorry, but I believe the
survivors are those kids.

67
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:43,654
{\an7}Okay, but even if they are,
you're never gonna get there
in time to help them!

68
00:05:43,688 --> 00:05:46,922
{\an8}[yawning]

69
00:05:46,956 --> 00:05:51,023
{\an7}Listen, if you're just going
to bore me like this, then
we're done here. Later!

70
00:05:51,356 --> 00:05:53,224
{\an7}Hey, Omoi! Come back here!

71
00:05:56,124 --> 00:06:01,058
{\an7}<i>Knowing them, they've</i>
<i>probably already taken down</i>
<i>the enemy and they're having</i>
<i>a party to celebrate.</i>

72
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:05,326
{\an7}<i>I mean, by now, they could</i>
<i>even be well into their</i>
<i>second round of partying! </i>

73
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:10,360
{\an7}<i>I can't have any alcohol,</i>
<i>but maybe they'll give me</i>
<i>juice for a toast. If they</i>
<i>do, I'll make one </i>

74
00:06:10,394 --> 00:06:12,027
{\an7}<i>that lasts until morning!</i>

75
00:06:13,294 --> 00:06:16,161
{\an1}It's no good. He's
not answering me.

76
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:21,029
{\an4}Lord Raikage, I'm so
sorry about this! Please
let me go capture that
fool and tie him up.

77
00:06:21,062 --> 00:06:22,795
{\an1}I gotta do something, here!

78
00:06:23,497 --> 00:06:27,562
{\an1}You know if there are
survivors from the
Thundercloud Unit out there...

79
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:31,064
{\an1}We still can't give them any
special treatment, even if
they are young!

80
00:06:31,097 --> 00:06:34,198
{\an1}Kakashi, Guy, Lee, Sai...

81
00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:37,765
{\an1}You can handle things there
without Omoi for about an
hour, can't you?

82
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,033
Huh?!

83
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:44,833
{\an4}Even if it's just for an
hour, losing someone as
strong as Omoi will hinder
us.

84
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:46,367
{\an1}But we'll manage.

85
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:50,468
{\an1}We'll try five- No, ten
times harder, and we'll make
it all work somehow!

86
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:51,768
{\an1}Just leave it to us!

87
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:53,667
I will fight a
hundred times harder!

88
00:06:54,135 --> 00:06:55,236
You do that.

89
00:06:56,568 --> 00:06:58,336
You heard them!

90
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:00,137
Thank you.

91
00:07:11,638 --> 00:07:15,906
{\an7}Sorry, Omoi... I guess
it's all up to you now.

92
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:20,106
{\an1}But, still Omoi's
all by himself.

93
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,307
{\an1}Give me the positions of
Naruto's Shadow Clones!

94
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:24,940
That kid?

95
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:28,641
{\an1}A single one of his Shadow
Clones has the strength to
protect an entire village.

96
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:32,009
Well, uh, that's
overstating it a bit.

97
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:36,076
{\an4}There's only one Shadow
Clone that's close to
Battlefield Seven, but at
least he's headed in

98
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:37,477
that direction.

99
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:39,610
{\an1}He's quite a ways
away, though.

100
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:42,611
Notify Naruto!

101
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:47,912
{\an7}<i>I know that I promised</i>
<i>Lord Raikage I'd take</i>
<i>care of this in just one</i>
<i>hour. But what if I</i>

102
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:51,046
{\an7}<i>actually manage to finish</i>
<i>it all up in only thirty</i>
<i>minutes?</i>

103
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:56,646
{\an7}<i>And what if he's so</i>
<i>impressed that he says,</i>
<i>"Good job, Omoi! You're going</i>
<i>to be the next Raikage!"</i>

104
00:07:56,679 --> 00:08:00,947
{\an7}<i>But what if instead of</i>
<i>one hour, it takes me</i>
<i>three hours!</i>

105
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:05,315
{\an7}<i>Then he might say, "Go back</i>
<i>to the village! We don't</i>
<i>want you around here</i>
<i>anymore!"</i>

106
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:09,483
Well, either way
I'm getting close.

107
00:08:09,517 --> 00:08:12,216
{\an1}Over this hill is a desolate
place without even a blade
of grass.

108
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:17,351
{\an4}I bet that they rolled out
the red carpet for me and
maybe even hung up a banner
that says, "Welcome Omoi!"

109
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:35,255
{\an1}No way! Are you kidding?!
What, is this all some kind
of prank?

110
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:46,057
The Hidden Mist...

111
00:08:46,623 --> 00:08:51,358
{\an1}[sinister chuckling]

112
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:55,525
{\an1}[sinister chuckling]

113
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,427
{\an1}Just one of you?!
You can't stop us!

114
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,494
Damn you!

115
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:11,261
{\an1}Boy, this sure isn't the red
carpet I was expecting!

116
00:09:19,196 --> 00:09:23,596
{\an4}I'm sorry to let you down
but that sure doesn't mean
that I'm just going to give
up, you know!

117
00:09:28,098 --> 00:09:31,697
{\an1}Naruto Uzumaki! At your
service to help out!

118
00:09:31,731 --> 00:09:33,366
{\an1}Wait, you're that...

119

{\an1}You're Omoi, right?

123
00:10:07,838 --> 00:10:11,006
{\an1}I don't quite get what's
going on... But I do believe
what you said.

124
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,406
Huh?

125
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,706
{\an1}That those kids are still
alive! And that you're gonna
save them.

126
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,240
{\an1}[chuckle] Thanks, but it's
not just about believing.

127
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:22,707
{\an1}Those kids are alive. And
they're waiting for me to
come help them.

128
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:23,908
{\an1}You got that right!

129
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:24,841

130
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:26,642
They're coming!

00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:43,745

00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:03,416
{\an1}Sorry! It was just
an accident!

138
00:11:06,116 --> 00:11:09,517
Oh, good. It was
just a Shadow Clone.

139
00:11:09,551 --> 00:11:11,017
No! Not good!

140
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,617
{\an1}Naruto was really
helping! I'm a fool!

141
00:11:16,418 --> 00:11:20,685
{\an1}You know, I bet Naruto
thought I could handle this
whole thing by myself.

142
00:11:23,886 --> 00:11:25,586
{\an1}And he let himself get hit!

143
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:31,687
{\an4}Yeah I got this! These guys
aren't that good. I can
definitely handle them
alone!

144
00:11:32,288 --> 00:11:34,522
{\an1}Those kids are alive out
there somewhere!

145
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:45,657
{\an7}<i>But it's impossible to do</i>
<i>this in thirty minutes. Even</i>
<i>in an hour it might not be</i>
<i>possible.</i>

146
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:50,791
{\an7}<i>How about two hours? If I</i>
<i>get it done in two hours,</i>
<i>maybe Lord Raikage will</i>
<i>give me a break</i>

147
00:11:50,825 --> 00:11:53,724
{\an7}<i>and still name me as</i>
<i>the next Raikage.</i>

148
00:12:05,928 --> 00:12:07,961
{\an8}<i>What is this?!</i>

149
00:12:15,963 --> 00:12:17,564
[gasp]

150
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:38,800
{\an1}They're exhaling poison gas...

151
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:40,934
Red soil?

152
00:12:42,768 --> 00:12:46,634
{\an4}Some of those white guys
have turned red... It must
have something to do with
that red soil.

153
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:12,540
{\an1}What do I do? I'm stuck
here, and in every direction
is a field of poison.

154
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:17,541
{\an1}What is that thing?

155
00:13:26,477 --> 00:13:27,510
There!

156
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:29,777
They're inside!

157
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:31,643
I'm sure of it!

158
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:56,049
{\an8}<i>They're alive!</i>

159
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:07,984
{\an7}<i>They're alive, they're</i>
<i>alive, they're alive!</i>

160
00:14:08,418 --> 00:14:09,650
{\an7}<i>They're definitely alive!</i>

161
00:14:40,124 --> 00:14:41,690
{\an1}It's bad! Stay back!

162
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:43,124
Stay away!

163
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,197
{\an1}Not good. They'll
locate us soon.

164
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:33,967
{\an1}They'll figure out we're
here sooner or later.

165
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,766
{\an1}And we're running
out of air.

166
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:40,135
{\an1}We weren't ready. We're
still too young for battle.

167
00:15:40,168 --> 00:15:42,369
{\an1}That's why Lord Raikage put
us with the supply unit.

168
00:15:42,402 --> 00:15:44,169
{\an1}No point saying that now.

169
00:15:44,202 --> 00:15:48,604
{\an4}Back when Yukai first
suggested that we go to help
out, why didn't you guys
oppose it?

170
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:57,606
{\an1}Sorry... I'm just frustrated
that there doesn't seem to
be anything we can do now.

171
00:15:58,239 --> 00:15:59,405
Same here.

172
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:01,172
{\an1}I'm angry, too, Yukai.

173
00:16:01,805 --> 00:16:05,973
{\an1}I feel horrible about this.
It was my decision as leader
that brought us here.

174
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:10,141
{\an1}I'm frustrated, as well.

175
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,841
{\an1}If we're just stuck
waiting to die...

176
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,075
{\an1}Let's go out with
a bang, together!

177
00:16:34,845 --> 00:16:37,812
{\an7}<i>Good thing I was able to</i>
<i>get away underwater!</i>

178
00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:41,313
{\an7}<i>But I'm just like everyone</i>
<i>else: I can't hold my breath</i>
<i>forever!</i>

179
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:49,549
{\an7}<i>Damn it! That's it! I've</i>
<i>reached my limit!</i>

180
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:23,088
{\an8}<i>Lightning Style!</i>
<i>Thunderbolt!</i>

181
00:17:23,821 --> 00:17:26,955
{\an8}[screaming]

182
00:17:31,189 --> 00:17:32,090
{\an8}<i>This is...</i>

183
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:38,091
{\an1}They're alive, they're
alive, they're alive!

184
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,225
[yelling]

185
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:02,794
{\an7}<i>Even if we all die, at least</i>
<i>we can deal the enemy a blow</i>
<i>before we do...</i>

186
00:18:07,496 --> 00:18:09,531
{\an7}<i>Big sister gave me this...</i>

187
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:17,664
{\an8}<i>You came, Omoi!</i>

188
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,865
[chuckle]

189
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:42,236
{\an8}<i>Lightning Style!</i>
<i>Coordinated Thunder Bomb!</i>

190
00:18:43,103 --> 00:18:48,703
{\an7}[painful screaming]

191
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:02,873
{\an1}[heavy breathing]

192
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:06,674
{\an7}<i>This red soil is saturated</i>
<i>with moisture, so it</i>
<i>conducts really well.</i>

193
00:19:06,707 --> 00:19:09,908
{\an7}<i>Which makes the Lightning</i>
<i>Style's power off the charts!</i>

194
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,909
{\an1}Hey, it's okay to
breathe, right?

195
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,842
[big inhale]

196
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:18,377
{\an1}Yeah, but it's not fresh
like an open field.

197
00:19:26,844 --> 00:19:28,745
{\an1}I used up my chakra...

198
00:19:28,778 --> 00:19:32,779
{\an1}Big Brother Omoi, just
give us a chance to show
what we can do now.

199
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:39,614
{\an1}Sure. I think that you
guys'll manage just fine.

200
00:19:39,648 --> 00:19:41,880
[yawning]

201
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:43,348
Let's go!

202
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:46,915
[attacking yell]

203
00:19:57,917 --> 00:20:01,851
{\an1}Didn't I tell you guys? I
knew that they were still
alive!

204
00:20:04,352 --> 00:20:07,985
{\an4}Someone who left his
post in the middle of a
war and acted on his own
without orders has

205
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:10,453
{\an1}no right to sit on
some high horse!

206
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:13,753
{\an1}And tell your subordinates
there to stop showing off!

207
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,621
{\an1}Sorry, but I think it's
about time they started
showing off.

208
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,355
{\an1}These guys have come of
age in a major way.

209
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,056
{\an1}Omoi! You impulsive
greenhorn!

210
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:28,490
{\an1}[gasp] Lord Raikage!

211
00:20:28,756 --> 00:20:30,623
{\an1}I gave you just one hour!

212
00:20:30,658 --> 00:20:35,124
{\an4}And if you don't return
within that time, then I'll
punish you myself! So be
prepared!

213
00:20:35,157 --> 00:20:39,525
{\an1}Yes! I understand!
[scared whimpering]

214
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:42,326
[laughing]

215
00:20:49,826 --> 00:20:51,127
{\an8}<i>Thank you... </i>

{\an8}<i>Omoi.</i>

217
00:20:56,894 --> 00:21:00,663
{\an1}I bet that I'm gonna fall
into a hole somewhere along
the way back to camp...

218
00:21:00,695 --> 00:21:04,696
{\an7}<i>And I'll get trapped because</i>
<i>it's so deep. And the whole</i>
<i>time that I'm stuck I'm in</i>

219
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:07,363
{\an7}<i>there, the clock will</i>
<i>just keep on ticking.</i>

220
00:21:07,764 --> 00:21:13,332
{\an7}<i>So I won't make it back by</i>
<i>the time I promised Lord</i>
<i>Raikage, and he's going to</i>
<i>get super mad at me...</i>

221
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:18,799
Oh man, why am I
always so unlucky?

222
00:22:57,017 --> 00:22:58,586
{\an1}<i>Finally caught up with you!</i>

223
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:00,818
{\an1}<i>Well, it's about time! What</i>
<i>have you been doing?</i>

224
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:05,587
{\an1}<i>A persistent pee, yo.</i>
<i>Anyway, one of your Shadow</i>
<i>Clones contacted me earlier.</i>

225
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,752
{\an1}<i>How are all the others</i>
<i>doing, by the way?</i>

226
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:11,354
{\an1}<i>They should arrive on the</i>
<i>frontlines of every last</i>
<i>battlefield right about now.</i>

227
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:16,422
{\an1}<i>Then all the fakers we're</i>
<i>gonna seek out. All the bad</i>
<i>guys we'll defeat, no doubt.</i>

228
00:23:16,455 --> 00:23:20,755
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Reinforcements</i>
<i>Arrive."</i>

229
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:22,456
{\an1}<i>But we gotta hurry!</i>
