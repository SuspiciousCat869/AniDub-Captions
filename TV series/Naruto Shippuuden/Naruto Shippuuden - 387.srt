1
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:54,497
{\an1}I will never go over
to your side, Naruto!

2
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:57,697
I have no
regrets with my path.

3
00:02:59,331 --> 00:03:03,231
{\an1}Remember I said I
saw everything.

4
00:03:04,232 --> 00:03:05,499
[gasp]

5
00:03:05,898 --> 00:03:07,032
That's right!

6
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:08,265
So...

7
00:03:08,298 --> 00:03:09,831
...don't...

8
00:03:10,465 --> 00:03:12,832
{\an1}...keep imagining
yourself as Hokage!

9
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:34,902
{\an1}The person Rin wanted to
watch over isn't the current

10
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:37,835
{\an1}you, it's Obito Uchiha.

11
00:03:52,471 --> 00:03:55,138
We're late again
thanks to you, Obito!

12
00:03:56,338 --> 00:03:57,537
Let's go, Obito.

13
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,205
Sorry!

14
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,272
{\an1}We'll be right there!

15
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:04,072
Rin, you...

16
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:28,841
That's right.

17
00:04:29,176 --> 00:04:32,176
{\an1}You ought to fill in that
hole in your heart yourself.

18
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:34,575
{\an1}Others won't be of any help.

19
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:37,411
Now...

20
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:39,077
Come here.

21
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:40,576
C'mon...

22
00:04:41,277 --> 00:04:43,077
{\an1}I won't ever ignore you.

23
00:04:43,411 --> 00:04:44,577
Come...

24
00:04:44,611 --> 00:04:45,811
Come...

25
00:04:46,145 --> 00:04:47,412
Obito...

26
00:04:47,445 --> 00:04:48,611
Hold on, Rin!

27
00:04:53,413 --> 00:04:54,379
That's right.

28
00:04:54,413 --> 00:04:56,046
{\an1}Rin wouldn't even
give the time of day

29
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,578
{\an1}to the current you.

30
00:04:57,945 --> 00:05:01,013
{\an1}The one Rin that wanted to
watch over is Obito Uchiha.

31
00:05:01,313 --> 00:05:02,480
[gasp]

32
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,313
{\an1}So give it up already.

33
00:05:05,147 --> 00:05:06,013
I am...

34
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,781
...Obito Uchiha!

35
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,547
Now come over,
you bastard!

36
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,148
Don't you dare
underestimate...

37
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,589
{\an1}Everyone's power!

38
00:06:25,891 --> 00:06:27,091
They're all out!

39
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:35,792
{\an1}[celebratory yell]

40
00:06:38,892 --> 00:06:40,225
Yeah!

41
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:01,062
I lost?!

42
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,733
{\an1}It'll finally be time for
the dreams of the moon to

43
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:43,034
{\an1}completely bury this
gaping hole of hell!

44
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,334
{\an1}There's nothing in my heart!

45
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:48,501
{\an1}I don't even feel
pain any longer.

46
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:53,069
{\an1}There's no need to
feel guilty, Kakashi.

47
00:07:53,102 --> 00:07:56,135
{\an1}This hole was opened up
by this world of hell.

48
00:07:57,135 --> 00:08:01,370
{\an1}Do you think such things can
fill the hole in your heart?

49
00:08:04,403 --> 00:08:07,538
Don't erase the
memories of the real Rin!

50
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,703
Rin sacrificed
herself in order to

51
00:08:09,737 --> 00:08:11,104
{\an1}protect the village!

52
00:08:12,104 --> 00:08:15,305
{\an1}You can try all you want to
fill it with delusions...

53
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:18,738
{\an1}But that hole in your
heart won't go away!

54
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:25,273
{\an1}The hole in one's heart gets
filled by others around you.

55
00:08:40,508 --> 00:08:41,707
Let's go!

56
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:45,242
[giggle]

57
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:03,644
Rin...

58
00:09:28,214 --> 00:09:30,414
{\an1}Well, it looks like you
kept your promise, Naruto

59
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:32,415
Uzumaki!

60
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:36,815
{\an1}So that's the reason I
want to help you, too.

61
00:09:36,848 --> 00:09:40,550
{\an1}I have to say, I'm impressed
that really rescued us!

62
00:09:40,582 --> 00:09:41,749
Hey, Son!

63
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:42,715
Sure thing!

64
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:43,882
[chuckle]

65
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,149
We were lucky.

66
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:46,483
He done it.

67
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:47,950
Yes!

68
00:09:47,983 --> 00:09:49,150
Excellent!

69
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:50,517
You're right.

70
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:51,817
I'm glad!

71
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,517
{\an1}Hmm? Isn't he that kid?

72
00:10:09,585 --> 00:10:10,953
Hey!

73
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,886
Wait!

74
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,886
Just...

75
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,087
Hold up, Sasuke!

76
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,953
Where is he?!

77
00:10:15,986 --> 00:10:17,253
{\an1}What happened to him?!

78
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:18,455
Over there!

79
00:10:18,488 --> 00:10:19,887
{\an1}He's still alive!

80
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:32,255
Right, I lost.

81
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,957
Kakashi!

82
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,824
{\an1}Sasuke, I promise
we'll talk more later.

83
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:46,957
I apologize for
appearing so suddenly.

84
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,459
{\an1}But I was once his
classmate and friend,

85
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:52,724
{\an1}so please, let me take
responsibility for him.

86
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:56,591
Kakashi Sensei!

87
00:10:56,624 --> 00:10:57,792
No, he's now-!

88
00:11:05,027 --> 00:11:06,327
Dad, what-?!

89
00:11:09,027 --> 00:11:10,360
He's weakened!

90
00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:12,694
{\an1}Now's the time to
finish him off!

91
00:11:12,727 --> 00:11:13,861
{\an1}Let's go and get him!

92
00:11:14,528 --> 00:11:15,694
Hold!

93
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:24,995
Obito...

94
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,197
{\an1}When we played chakra
tug-of-war, just

95
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,796
{\an1}now, I got to see the
inside of your heart.

96
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,697
{\an1}It looked like my son
nagged and lectured

97
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,264
you quite a bit.

98
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:43,399
{\an1}Something that he seems
to have inherited

99
00:11:43,432 --> 00:11:44,898
from his mother.

100
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:46,865
But, Dad...

101
00:11:47,698 --> 00:11:50,598
{\an1}And besides, that
really ought to be your job.

102
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:57,300
{\an1}For I believe the one who
truly understands and would

103
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,000
{\an1}know what to say to Obito...

104
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,967
...is you, his
friend, Kakashi.

105
00:12:07,202 --> 00:12:08,901
{\an1}Isn't that right, Naruto?

106
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:29,737
Naruto...

107
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:31,871
You two and the
Allied Shinobi Forces

108
00:12:31,904 --> 00:12:33,338
{\an1}should help Lord First.

109
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:35,038
{\an1}Go and seal Madara away.

110
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:37,038
{\an1}Oh yeah, that's right!

111
00:12:37,071 --> 00:12:38,172
{\an1}I forgot about him!

112
00:12:38,206 --> 00:12:39,705
{\an1}Let's go, Sasuke!

113
00:12:42,473 --> 00:12:45,507
{\an1}I think you guys were
younger than Naruto is now.

114
00:12:46,373 --> 00:12:47,706
You remember?

115
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:51,240
{\an1}All the missions that
the four of us went on?

116
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:54,807
{\an1}Rin, as a Medic Ninja,
did her utmost to

117
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,475
{\an1}protect the both of you.

118
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:59,807
{\an1}She never would have wanted
things to end up like this.

119
00:13:11,243 --> 00:13:14,943
{\an1}But what caused all of this
that's my responsibility.

120
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:20,910
Yes.

121
00:13:20,944 --> 00:13:22,743
Can I explain
the mission now?

122
00:13:22,777 --> 00:13:24,245
We don't have
that much time.

123
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:25,945
{\an1}We're getting close
to the border now.

124
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,513
{\an1}See, it's this line here.

125
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,480
{\an1}It shows where the Land
of Earth is currently

126
00:13:36,513 --> 00:13:38,413
{\an1}invading the Village
Hidden in the Grass.

127
00:13:38,446 --> 00:13:41,613
{\an1}The enemy are shinobi
from the Hidden Stone.

128
00:13:41,646 --> 00:13:43,947
{\an1}And, according to intel,
they've deployed a thousand

129
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,680
{\an1}shinobi to the front lines.

130
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,980
Here.

131
00:13:47,781 --> 00:13:49,914
They've advanced
farther than the last time.

132
00:13:49,948 --> 00:13:51,747
{\an1}Well, the Grass Village
is situated right

133
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:53,647
{\an1}next to the Land of Fire.

134
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:55,049
We should have
stepped in earlier.

135
00:13:56,349 --> 00:13:59,316
{\an1}If the Hidden Stone's able
to invade like this, Then it

136
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:02,015
{\an1}must mean that they have
an efficient system

137
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,217
{\an1}for reinforcement.

138
00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:06,850
{\an1}That's why our mission is
this: the Kannabi Bridge. To

139
00:14:06,883 --> 00:14:10,150
{\an1}crush your enemy at the
front lines requires an

140
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,518
{\an1}immense amount of
shinobi, right?

141
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,551
{\an1}Therefore, shinobi like us
whose focus is sabotage are

142
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:18,285
{\an1}forced to work in a
small efficient unit.

143
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:21,486
The bridge...

144
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,152
So our mission
is infiltration.

145
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:31,320
{\an1}Team Kakashi, Your mission
is to sneak behind the enemy

146
00:14:31,353 --> 00:14:32,819
{\an1}and reach that bridge.

147
00:14:32,853 --> 00:14:34,887
{\an1}Once the three of you are
there, you will destroy it

148
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,954
{\an1}in order to disrupt the
enemy's support operation.

149
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:40,454
{\an1}After that, you will
promptly withdraw.

150
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:42,422
Understood!

151
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:47,088
And you, sir?

152
00:14:47,522 --> 00:14:49,922
{\an1}I'll confront the enemy
directly on the battlefield.

153
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,956
{\an1}That will create a diversion
so that you can do your job.

154
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:55,423
Now, remember:
Kakashi's your captain

155
00:14:55,456 --> 00:14:56,755
on this mission.

156
00:14:56,789 --> 00:14:59,257
{\an1}All four of us will travel
to the border together.

157
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,390
{\an1}But once we get there, we'll
split up for our missions.

158
00:15:03,357 --> 00:15:04,357
Right!

159
00:15:06,191 --> 00:15:08,091
{\an1}This is where we go
our separate ways.

160
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,757
{\an1}Do your best, all of you.

161
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,824
{\an1}The enemy that we
encountered yesterday

162
00:15:11,858 --> 00:15:13,658
{\an1}was merely a lone scout.

163
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:15,825
{\an1}But now we should
expect to fight teams.

164
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:17,192
Be careful!

165
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,959
Let's get going
then Captain!

166
00:15:35,795 --> 00:15:38,596
{\an1}It's no coincidence that
I, who should be dead, am

167
00:15:38,628 --> 00:15:41,162
standing before
you two like this.

168
00:15:41,496 --> 00:15:43,295
{\an1}Perhaps Rin made it happen.

169
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:46,530
{\an1}Her way of scolding me for
my failures as your teacher.

170
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,630
{\an1}I'm so sorry that I
couldn't protect Rin.

171
00:16:10,632 --> 00:16:15,567
{\an1}Rin was my sole light and
hope in this dark world.

172
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:20,467
{\an1}After I lost Rin...

173
00:16:21,134 --> 00:16:23,801
{\an1}The whole world as
I saw it changed.

174
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:25,934
{\an1}It became a black hell.

175
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:28,634
{\an1}This world holds no hope.

176
00:16:29,468 --> 00:16:32,269
{\an1}I took Madara's identity and
walked the world, but all

177
00:16:32,302 --> 00:16:35,668
{\an1}that did was further
confirm my belief.

178
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:39,170
{\an1}Even possessing this
Sharingan didn't

179
00:16:39,203 --> 00:16:41,203
{\an1}reveal anything to me.

180
00:16:41,237 --> 00:16:43,237
'Cause there was
nothing to see.

181
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:49,937
I don't know
anything for sure either...

182
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:51,637
[gasp]

183
00:16:53,606 --> 00:16:56,671
Then you can't
say my path is-!

184
00:16:57,038 --> 00:17:00,439
{\an1}Without a doubt, your
path is just one of many.

185
00:17:01,106 --> 00:17:04,039
And it may not
actually be wrong either.

186
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:14,207
{\an1}I've thought that
this world is hell, too.

187
00:17:15,374 --> 00:17:17,041
{\an1}I thought that I'd lost you.

188
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,908
{\an1}And then lost Rin
right after that.

189
00:17:21,075 --> 00:17:24,576
{\an1}And later, I even lost
Minato Sensei, as well.

190
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:26,243
But...

191
00:17:32,444 --> 00:17:33,977
{\an1}Oh, that's right!

192
00:17:34,377 --> 00:17:36,043
{\an1}I totally forgot...

193
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,245
{\an1}I was the only one who
didn't give you a gift for

194
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:47,579
{\an1}becoming a jonin and
being named captain.

195
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,778
{\an1}I thought about it,
and I didn't know

196
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:56,113
{\an1}what would be good.

197
00:17:57,646 --> 00:17:59,046
But I do now.

198
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,581
{\an1}Don't worry, I remember
what you said before.

199
00:18:06,047 --> 00:18:08,515
{\an1}I'm not going to give
you something useless.

200
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:15,715
{\an1}I'm giving you my Sharingan.

201
00:18:18,382 --> 00:18:19,682
[gasp]

202
00:18:21,682 --> 00:18:24,216
{\an1}Whatever the village
or anyone else may say.

203
00:18:25,216 --> 00:18:27,783
I think that
you're a great Jonin.

204
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:30,084
It's true.

205
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:31,817
{\an1}That's how I really feel.

206
00:18:33,017 --> 00:18:34,385
{\an1}Please accept this...

207
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:38,818
{\an1}Even though I don't know
anything for sure, I tried

208
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,718
{\an1}my best to see the
world with this eye.

209
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:44,986
{\an1}I felt that as long as I had
your Sharingan and words, I

210
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:46,919
{\an1}could see the future.

211
00:18:50,987 --> 00:18:53,387
And what you saw
was Naruto, huh?

212
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:58,921
{\an1}How can you be sure
that his path won't fail?!

213
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:02,888
Actually...

214
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:05,089
{\an1}He may very well fail, too.

215
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:06,556
Of course.

216
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:13,323
So what's the
difference between us?!

217
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,890
{\an1}Why go so far for him?

218
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:21,091
{\an1}Because I can attest that he
won't fail as much as you.

219
00:19:22,091 --> 00:19:22,924
How?!

220
00:19:27,024 --> 00:19:29,025
{\an1}Because if he starts
to trip and stumble on

221
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:31,292
{\an1}his path, I'll help him!

222
00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:37,692
Why?!

223
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:39,059
{\an1}Why would you help him?!

224
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,761
{\an1}Because he'd never give up
on his dreams or on reality.

225
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,961
That's the kind
of guy he is.

226
00:19:58,262 --> 00:19:59,463
Found him!

227
00:19:59,795 --> 00:20:00,662
[gasp]

228
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:05,029
{\an1}And the way he forges
ahead draws others to him.

229
00:20:05,062 --> 00:20:07,130
{\an1}He makes you want
to reach out when

230
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,497
{\an1}he's about to stumble.

231
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:11,130
{\an1}The larger and greater
the support behind you, the

232
00:20:11,164 --> 00:20:13,430
closer you can
get to your goal.

233
00:20:13,763 --> 00:20:15,465
{\an1}That's the difference.

234
00:20:37,699 --> 00:20:39,568
{\an1}Massive Rasen Shuriken!

235
00:20:39,867 --> 00:20:40,934
Bigger!

236
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:42,134
{\an1}We need a real big one!

237
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:43,700
Right!

238
00:20:47,035 --> 00:20:51,369
{\an1}Is such a thing possible
in this pitch-black hell?

239
00:20:52,202 --> 00:20:53,035
Is it?

240
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:56,936
{\an1}I'm sure you could've seen
it, too, if you'd tried.

241
00:20:57,603 --> 00:21:00,702
{\an1}After all, you and I
have the same eyes.

242
00:21:02,703 --> 00:21:06,070
{\an1}If comrades you trust gather
around you, hope can take

243
00:21:06,104 --> 00:21:09,138
{\an1}physical form and
become visible.

244
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:12,871
That's what I
believe...

245
00:21:16,738 --> 00:21:17,739
Obito.

246
00:22:57,185 --> 00:22:59,386
{\an1}<i>Naruto Uzumaki, huh?</i>

247
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,052
{\an1}<i>Seems you've become rather</i>
<i>close friends with that Fox</i>

248
00:23:02,085 --> 00:23:04,419
{\an1}<i>Demon's brat, Gaara.</i>

249
00:23:04,452 --> 00:23:07,086
{\an1}<i>If you're not going to</i>
<i>help, let's talk later.</i>

250
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
<i>I'm going in.</i>

251
00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:11,886
{\an1}<i>Sand Shinobi human,</i>
<i>are you a friend</i>

252
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,820
{\an1}<i>of Naruto's, as well?</i>

253
00:23:14,154 --> 00:23:18,054
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "My First</i>
<i>Friend."</i>

254
00:23:18,087 --> 00:23:20,121
<i>We all want to</i>
<i>help out as well!</i>
