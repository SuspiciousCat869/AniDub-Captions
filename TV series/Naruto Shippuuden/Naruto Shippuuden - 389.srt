00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:36,461
Yeah...

149
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:45,067
{\an4}After observing for a while,
I believe it will be hard to
let Hinata take over as head
of the main family.

150
00:16:45,101 --> 00:16:49,004
A decision will
have to be made
soon.

151
00:16:49,037 --> 00:16:52,973
{\an1}[sigh] I understand.

152
00:16:53,007 --> 00:16:56,343
{\an1}However, I'd like
to make a request.

153
00:16:56,943 --> 00:17:02,749
{\an1}You two will participate
in a mock battle today.

154
00:17:02,782 --> 00:17:04,683
{\an1}[gasp]

155
00:17:04,716 --> 00:17:09,654
{\an4}<i>(Haiashi)</i>
<i>I want to see all the skill and</i>

<i>Do not go easy on each other.</i>

156
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:12,323
{\an1}Fight with the
intent to kill.

157
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:17,761
{\an4}<i>(Hyuga Man)</i>
<i>Fight to kill?! He doesn't want</i>

158
00:17:18,394 --> 00:17:23,632
{\an1}Hinata... You're the
successor of the Hyuga
Clan...

159
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,135
{\an1}This is your chance to
show me you're worthy
of that.

160
00:17:27,168 --> 00:17:29,169
{\an1}Yes, sir...

161
00:17:31,672 --> 00:17:36,008
{\an8}<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>But... I'm supposed</i>

162
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:41,546
{\an1}<i>(Hiashi)</i>
<i>Begin!</i>

163
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:52,589
{\an8}<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>Elder Sister Hinata...</i>

164
00:17:56,793 --> 00:18:03,831
{\an1}Both of them
are amazing!

00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:14,840

{\an3}[sigh]

170
00:18:52,905 --> 00:18:54,572
{\an1}Father, I--

171
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:59,376
{\an1}Falling to Hanabi,
who's five years
younger...!

172
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:04,079
[gasp]...
[sob]

173
00:19:12,453 --> 00:19:17,558
{\an4}<i>(Elder)</i>
<i>Hinata will probably</i>

<i>as a Genin.</i>

174
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:21,427
{\an1}Oh, I see.

175
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:27,532
{\an4}It seems sad, but we
cannot allow a failure
like that to become
out successor...

176
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,467
{\an1}<i>...this is her</i>

177
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:38,374
{\an4}That you were born possessing
strength surpassing that of
your elder sister is also
destiny...

178
00:19:38,408 --> 00:19:43,779
{\an4}Hanabi, you must hone
your skills to the
utmost for the sake
of the Hyuga.

179
00:19:46,714 --> 00:19:50,751
Yes...

00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:11,267
{\an1}Stand up, Hanabi.

00:20:12,535 --> 00:20:16,038
[panting]

184
00:20:16,072 --> 00:20:21,977
{\an1}I will take Hinata under
my wing. But are you...
sure that's what you want?

185
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:27,113
{\an1}She is your first
born and heir to
your household.

186
00:20:27,146 --> 00:20:31,751
{\an1}The life of a Genin
can be dangerous and
brief.

187

you will.
