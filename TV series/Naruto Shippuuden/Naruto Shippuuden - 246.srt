112
00:10:12,182 --> 00:10:17,057

wasn't very manly or
dependable...

113
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:22,434
{\an4}So I didn't take him very

actually become Hokage.

recognize the truth.

{\an9}Hm?

119
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:42,803
{\an7}It's pretty snotty to declare
that you're going to become

another village, doncha think?

120
00:10:43,572 --> 00:10:47,011
{\an8}So, after that, all
the boys in class
began to tease me.

121
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,049

a mean nickname.

127
