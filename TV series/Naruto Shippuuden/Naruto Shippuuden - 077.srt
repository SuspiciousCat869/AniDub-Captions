00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:03,174
-Well, they sure
haven't been here yet.

3
00:01:16,234 --> 00:01:18,216
-Not yet.

4
00:01:18,226 --> 00:01:20,259
We should set up a
perimeter and keep watch.

5
00:02:09,272 --> 00:02:11,306
-Argh.
-I don't know anything.

6
00:02:11,316 --> 00:02:14,220
And I couldn't tell
you, even if I did.

7
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,251
-No use.

8
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:16,333
What do we do with him?

9
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:17,435
-Ahh!

10
00:02:17,445 --> 00:02:21,320
-Let's let Ibiki squeeze
some answers out of him.

11
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,225
-I can't find any sign of
the Akatsuki in this place.

12
00:02:24,235 --> 00:02:25,457
-No, same here.

13
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:28,221
It doesn't look like anyone's
been through this place

14
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,262
for days.

15

If they're coming,
they haven't come yet.

16

[choking]

18
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:38,296
-Well, there haven't been
any requests for backup

19
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:41,320
from the units sent to the
other four collection offices.

20
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,423
-Meaning none of them has
made contact with the Akatsuki

21
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:45,286
yet, either.

22
00:02:45,296 --> 00:02:49,322
-Unless one of them is in the
middle of a fight right now.

23
00:02:49,332 --> 00:02:50,504
-Oh.

24
00:02:50,514 --> 00:02:52,457
-Oh, I wouldn't worry.

25
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:54,340
Especially not if
it's Asuma's team

26
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,463
that's made contact with them.

27
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:59,327
You guys know better than
anyone what a tough old warrior

28
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:00,479
Asuma is.

29
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:02,331
-We certainly do.

30
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:03,283
-Yeah.

31
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:04,415
And he's got Shikamaru with him.

32
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:05,506
-All right.

33
00:03:05,516 --> 00:03:08,350
Let's get out of here and
figure out what our strategy is.

34
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,481
-Hmm.

35
00:03:13,538 --> 00:03:15,341
-Let's go.

[soft grunt]

37
00:03:24,344 --> 00:03:27,519
-First of all, let's go over
everything we know so far.

38
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:31,345
The Akatsuki are headed for
one of five collection offices,

39
00:03:31,355 --> 00:03:32,496
and there's been
no call for backup

40
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:34,509
from the other four teams.

41
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:37,594
And it's clear they haven't
been anywhere near this one yet.

42
00:03:37,604 --> 00:03:39,617
-Which means that they're--

43
00:03:40,328 --> 00:03:41,400
-Mmm.

44
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,521
-Yeah, you've got a point.

45
00:03:42,531 --> 00:03:45,576
There's always a chance that the
Akatsuki are still on their way here.

46
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:47,479
-So we wait, then.

47
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,552
And when they show
up, we strike.

48
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,473
Got it?

49
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:27,588
[eagle cry]

50
00:04:27,598 --> 00:04:29,641
-I want a man covering
every possible approach

51
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:31,534
the enemy might use.

52
00:04:31,544 --> 00:04:34,529
So, like we discussed, fan
out, take up your positions,

53
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:35,490
and wait.

54
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,465
-Right.

55
00:04:38,475 --> 00:04:39,616

are the Akatsuki?

-Hmm.

00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:39,964
-Ow.

66
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:41,817
That hurts.

67
00:08:41,827 --> 00:08:42,828
Who are you people?

68
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,784
-What the hell?

69
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:48,797
We both hit his vital spots.

00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:55,057
Is he immortal?

We are Shinobi of
the Leaf village.

89
00:09:26,904 --> 00:09:31,010
Our orders are to capture
or eliminate you Akatsuki.

90
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,856
We already know you
usually operate in pairs.

91
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,949
My original idea was
to take down one of you

92
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,984
first, then capture the other.

93
00:09:39,994 --> 00:09:43,078

going to have to change.

-Your partner.

-That fellow in front.

00:10:14,976 --> 00:10:16,117
Well, well.

For once, you
struck gold, Hidan.

Just stay out of
this, all right?

I want these three
for my ritual.

112
00:10:26,112 --> 00:10:28,055
You can have them after.

-(VOICEOVER) Kakazu, huh?

114
00:10:29,968 --> 00:10:31,090
And Hidan.

-Very well.

116
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:37,099
But don't get careless,
or you're dead.

117
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:38,110
-Not that again.

118
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,212
Knock it off, will you?

119
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:49,207
Believe me, I wish
someone would kill me.

120
00:10:49,217 --> 00:10:53,022
But that's not possible.

doing with that diagram?

122
00:10:56,027 --> 00:10:57,158
-I'll attack alone.

123
00:10:57,168 --> 00:11:00,193
Try to trap Mr. Immortal
with your Shadow Stitching.

124
00:11:00,203 --> 00:11:03,087
Capture him, even if
it's only for an instant.

125
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:05,992
That's all the time I'll
need to take his head off.

126

-This kind of move
is crazy risky.

127
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:09,196
It's not like you.

128
00:11:09,206 --> 00:11:11,229
-I'll go in with you.

00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:13,122
-Don't you guys get it?

130
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:14,284
It's the only move we've got!

[gulp]

132
00:11:16,037 --> 00:11:19,131

seen Asuma like this.

-Look.

134
00:11:20,143 --> 00:11:21,304
These two are
stronger than I am.

135
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,297
Izumo and Kotetsu.

136
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,112
You two will provide
Shikamaru with backup

137
00:11:26,122 --> 00:11:28,034
against the other Akatsuki.

138
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:30,238
-Now that we have an idea
of the enemy's strength,

139
00:11:30,248 --> 00:11:33,272
wouldn't it be better for
us to fall back and regroup?

140
00:11:33,282 --> 00:11:36,046
-You think they're going
to let us just turn around

141
00:11:36,056 --> 00:11:39,071
and walk away?

142
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:41,304
If we don't stand and
fight them right now,

143
00:11:41,314 --> 00:11:43,207
we'll be slaughtered.

144
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:46,272
And the Leaf village will
be in even greater danger.

145
00:11:46,282 --> 00:11:49,276
To penetrate the enemy's
line, sometimes you

146
00:11:49,286 --> 00:11:51,169
have to risk a bold move.

147
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:58,309
-But I thought you always
hated risky moves like that.

148
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,132
just like me.

149
00:12:00,142 --> 00:12:03,187
-To defend your King
from a superior opponent,

150
00:12:03,197 --> 00:12:05,290
one must make some sacrifices.

151
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,084
-(VOICEOVER) He's not seriously
thinking of sacrificing

152
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,336
himself, is he?

153
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:12,280
One of these guys has
untold powers and abilities.

154
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,213
The other is immortal.

155
00:12:14,223 --> 00:12:17,298
It's true, we don't stand
much of a chance, but still.

156
00:12:17,308 --> 00:12:21,354
For Asuma to make himself
a sacrificial piece?

157
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:23,126
-Shogi?

158
00:12:23,136 --> 00:12:25,330
But it's such a drag.

159
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,274
-I know you're a lazy
bones, Shikamaru.

160
00:12:28,284 --> 00:12:30,257
But that's what makes
you so good at thinking

161
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:33,332
of clever stratagems to get
around trouble or hard work.

162
00:12:33,342 --> 00:12:35,315
-Mmm.

163
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:40,282
-You see, Shogi is a game
of countless variations,

164
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,265
all determined by
how you utilize

165
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:45,159
the characteristics of
the individual pieces.

166
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:47,252
It's a perfect game
for someone like you,

167
00:12:47,262 --> 00:12:49,376
who's always trying to
out-think the other guy.

168
00:12:49,386 --> 00:12:52,410
This book will give you
all the basic rules.

169
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,164
The rest you'll
learn as you play.

170
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,167
-What a pain.

171
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,449
Give me 10 minutes,
and I'll have it down.

172
00:13:03,436 --> 00:13:06,411
-You-- you beat me.

173
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:09,225
-You know, you don't
have to go easy on me.

174
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:10,207
Really.

175
00:13:10,217 --> 00:13:12,320
-You went with the
Climbing Silver.

176
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,471
-It's a move from the book.

177
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:17,347
You use an advance unit to break
through your opponent's lines.

178
00:13:17,357 --> 00:13:20,282
-Heh, heh.

179
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:23,266
-You're not upset because
you lost the game, are you?

180
00:13:23,276 --> 00:13:24,257
-No.

181
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:26,250
Sacrificing your
vanguard in order

182
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,243
to make a
breakthrough-- it's just

183
00:13:28,253 --> 00:13:31,358
the sort of logical shortcut
I'd expect from you,

184
00:13:31,368 --> 00:13:34,322
but I can't say that
I like it very much.

185
00:13:34,332 --> 00:13:36,345
-Hey, it's just a game.

186
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:38,429
-I suppose, but the
Climbing Silver,

187
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:40,422
while it may break
the enemy's line,

188
00:13:40,432 --> 00:13:43,316
ends with you
sacrificing your piece.

189
00:13:43,326 --> 00:13:45,229
Inflicting damage
on your opponent

190
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:47,332
is certainly one of the
objects of the game,

191
00:13:47,342 --> 00:13:50,416
but to throw away your
own man on a risky gambit?

192
00:13:50,426 --> 00:13:54,302
Frankly, that worries
me a little bit.

193
00:13:54,312 --> 00:13:55,411
-Mm-hmm.

194
00:13:58,478 --> 00:14:02,254
-You know, I'm not nearly as
logical as you think I am.

195
00:14:02,264 --> 00:14:03,426
-Ha ha.

196
00:14:03,436 --> 00:14:05,309
-Want to play again?

197
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:07,522
This time, I'll go
nice and slow, OK?

198
00:14:07,532 --> 00:14:09,315
And no more Climbing Silver.

199
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:13,431
-(VOICEOVER) You sacrifice
a piece only when

200
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:16,495
your opponent's so powerful
that you have no other option.

201
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:19,430
But which piece
do you sacrifice?

202
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,362
We three Chunin
aren't strong enough

203
00:14:21,372 --> 00:14:22,454
to make such a move worthwhile.

204
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,555
On the contrary, Asuma would be
at an even greater disadvantage

205
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:32,559
having to fight them
while worrying about us.

206
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:34,332
He's right.

207
00:14:34,342 --> 00:14:35,564
We'd all be slaughtered.

208
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,378
What's the best move then?

209
00:14:38,388 --> 00:14:41,452
Our opponent has major
pieces on the board.

210
00:14:41,462 --> 00:14:43,365
In order to capture
a major piece,

211
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,380
you need to dry him
out by baiting a trap.

212
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,561
But the bait has to
be tempting enough

213
00:14:47,572 --> 00:14:49,554
to make him take the risk.

214
00:14:49,564 --> 00:14:52,379
We're not strong enough,
not tempting enough,

215
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:54,502
to act as bait.

216
00:14:54,512 --> 00:14:58,548
We can only fight with
the pieces we've got.

217
00:14:58,558 --> 00:15:00,401
-Climbing Silver.

218
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:01,582
It's not a role that suits you.

219
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:02,454
-Heh.

220
00:15:02,464 --> 00:15:03,485
Don't sweat it.

221
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:05,448
I'm not going to be
the sacrificial piece.

222
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,581
I've got you with me, after all.

223
00:15:07,591 --> 00:15:08,623
-(VOICEOVER) Ugh.

224
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:10,596
I can't attack the major pieces.

225
00:15:10,606 --> 00:15:12,549
And I'm useless as bait.

226
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,413
Well, I can try and
distract them, I guess.

227
00:15:15,423 --> 00:15:17,476
-Have you finished strategizing?

228
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:20,390
Oh, that really hurts.

229
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,436
What pests you are,
poking me right and left.

230
00:15:24,446 --> 00:15:25,548
[gulp]

231
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,573
-They gods shall
punish those who

232
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,596
don't understand
the pain of others.

233
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:12,598
Ha.

234
00:16:16,594 --> 00:16:17,292
-Mmm.

235
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,725
-That's a nifty little
weapon you've got there.

236
00:16:31,065 --> 00:16:32,082
-Asuma!

237
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,730
-Come on.

238
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,583
Get to him.

239
00:16:42,593 --> 00:16:43,574
-(VOICEOVER) Hmm.

240
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:47,630
I don't want to
get caught by that.

241
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,593
-(VOICEOVER) I'll just
keep on coming at you.

242
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:01,641
-Grr!

243
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:02,562
-(VOICEOVER) Yes.

244
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:03,694
That's it, Shikamaru.

245
00:17:03,704 --> 00:17:05,757
As long as he has to
fight while watching out

246
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:10,725
for your Shadow Stitching,
it lessens his advantage.

247
00:17:10,735 --> 00:17:11,816
-Damn it.

248
00:17:11,826 --> 00:17:13,589
-(VOICEOVER) It's working.

249
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,562
My Shadow Stitching is
throwing him off enough

250
00:17:15,572 --> 00:17:17,625
to give Asuma a chance.

251
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:19,788
But what if this whole
gambit's a mistake?

252
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:22,823
I mean, what's the point of
gaining the advantage when

253
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,687
you're fighting against
a guy who's immortal?

254
00:17:25,697 --> 00:17:29,563
When we've got limited
chakra and only one life.

255
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:30,624
Oh, well.

256
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:34,570
It's too late to
think about it now.

257
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,844
This fight doesn't really
start 'til I grab him.

258
00:17:36,854 --> 00:17:40,649
-No, you don't.

259
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,641
-Oh, no.

260
00:17:45,757 --> 00:17:46,688
-Hmm?

261
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:47,760
-There's that stance again.

[singing voices]

-Ahhh!

264
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:02,722
-Yes. Chiriku's jutsu.

265
00:18:02,732 --> 00:18:05,636
Of course, Chiriku is better
at it than I am, but--

266
00:18:05,646 --> 00:18:06,758
-Ahhhh.

267
00:18:06,768 --> 00:18:07,689
-Hidan.

268
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:09,672
Don't underestimate them.

269
00:18:09,682 --> 00:18:10,814
-You stay out of it.

270
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:12,687
Just keep your mouth and watch.

271
00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:17,895
-Yeah. Nice move.

272
00:18:17,905 --> 00:18:19,898
-(VOICEOVER) The two of them
are acting in perfect sync.

273
00:18:23,924 --> 00:18:26,718
-(VOICEOVER) So far, the other
guy really is staying out

274
00:18:26,728 --> 00:18:27,799
of it.

275
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,742
But we can't depend on him
to stay out of it forever.

276
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,743
-You almost got him
that time, Shikamaru.

277
00:18:36,753 --> 00:18:37,764
Keep at it.

278
00:18:37,774 --> 00:18:38,796
-All right. Listen up.

279
00:18:38,806 --> 00:18:39,807
-Hmm?

280
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:41,830
-I may need you guys
to back me up, OK?

281
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:51,965
-Ha.

282
00:18:51,975 --> 00:18:53,878
It's always the way
with you nonbelievers.

283
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:55,941
You're so desperate
to escape your fate,

284
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:58,755
you choose the obvious
line of attack.

285
00:18:58,766 --> 00:18:59,967
You're so transparent.

286
00:18:59,977 --> 00:19:03,953
-You play around too much
when you fight, you know that?

287
00:19:03,963 --> 00:19:04,804
-Now!

288
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,882
You've got nowhere
to run this time.

289
00:19:09,892 --> 00:19:10,924
-Then I won't run.

-Immortal jerk.

care of the weak ones first.

nailed by the jutsu.

Why's the captain-- Oh, no.

Don't tell me--

00:22:06,195 --> 00:22:07,106
-What?

311
00:22:07,116 --> 00:22:08,238
What is it, Shikamaru?

312
00:22:08,248 --> 00:22:10,261
-I don't know exactly
how the guy's done it,

313
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:13,095
but it looks to me like
his and Asuma's bodies

314
00:22:13,105 --> 00:22:14,267
are connected somehow.

315

-What?

316
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:17,091
Connected?
