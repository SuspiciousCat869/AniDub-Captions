1
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,232
{\an1}Before he died...

2
00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:21,604
{\an1}Jiraiya told me to store
myself inside Naruto.

3
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:28,080
{\an4}Have you lost your mind?!
You're well aware that
the key that corresponds
to Naruto's Eight-Signed

4
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:30,316
{\an1}Seal is transcribed on my
belly!

5
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:35,056
{\an7}Each and every year, the
Fourth Hokage's seal
grows weaker! We keep
the key in order to

6
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,828
{\an7}retighten the seal if we
should ever find the
need!

7
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:41,467
{\an7}To place a key right next
to the lock it opens is
unheard of!

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,840
{\an7}Yes, and yet, Don't
forget that it was
entrusted to us by
Minato.

9
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:48,777
{\an7}It was always meant to be
returned to Naruto one
day.

10
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,446
{\an1}But it's too soon!

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,554
{\an4}Once already you
sweet-talked me into
loosening the Tetragram
Seal, and you know just

12
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,822
{\an1}as well as I do what
happened that time!

13
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,792
{\an1}<i>You haven't forgotten,</i>
<i>have you? </i>

14
00:01:06,904 --> 00:01:08,207
{\an1}No.

15
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:14,049
{\an1}<i>But... I believe that</i>
<i>Minato entrusting me with</i>
<i>this Jutsu Formula...</i>

16
00:01:14,082 --> 00:01:19,790
{\an4}Indicates that his will
was for Naruto to complete
that Jutsu for himself one
day.

17
00:01:21,393 --> 00:01:25,966
{\an4}Great Lord Elder! Are
you absolutely sure that
this is the right thing
to do?

18
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:35,347
{\an4}Jiraiya tested Naruto. He
was confident the boy would
be able to fully control
the Nine-Tails' power.

19
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,149
But it didn't
go well at all.

20
00:01:37,484 --> 00:01:42,191
{\an4}Jiraiya was still
convinced that Minato
wouldn't have sealed half
of Nine-Tails' chakra in

21
00:01:42,224 --> 00:01:45,795
{\an1}Naruto if it weren't
controllable.

22
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:47,064
Oh, boy...

23
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,643
{\an5}Great Lord Elder,...
Gerotora himself is the
key to Naruto's
Tetragram Seal.

24
00:01:54,676 --> 00:01:59,883
{\an8}Would it really be safe
to give him to Naruto? Tell
me. What are you thoughts?

25
00:02:00,784 --> 00:02:04,758
{\an1}Summon Naruto Uzumaki
here to me...

26
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,330
{\an1}And I shall peer into his
future.

27
00:02:08,363 --> 00:02:10,767
{\an1}Our choice will hinge on
that.

28
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:13,404
Wait, are you serious?!

29
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:17,410
{\an4}Well, it hasn't been
officially announced yet,
but judging by the
activity near the hut

30
00:02:17,443 --> 00:02:20,448
{\an1}where she's resting, I
think it's gotta be true!

31
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:26,624
{\an4}All of her attendants had
been in such low spirits,
but now they're all smiling
and laughing together.

32
00:02:26,657 --> 00:02:30,128
{\an1}It looks like all of our
wishes have been granted
at last!

33
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:40,812
[gobbling]

34
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:43,415
Uh...

35
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:44,651
{\an1}[gobbling]

36
00:02:44,684 --> 00:02:47,088
Goodness! Slow down!

37
00:02:47,121 --> 00:02:50,258
{\an1}It's not enough! My
chakra hasn't returned
to normal!

38
00:02:50,526 --> 00:02:52,995
[exhaling]

39
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:55,300
{\an1}Go get me some more
food, quickly!

40
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:58,705
{\an1}Relax, and I'll turn into
an old hag!

41
00:02:59,139 --> 00:02:59,673
[gasping]

42
00:02:59,706 --> 00:03:01,509
{\an1}Oh, no! It's happening!

43
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:06,617
{\an1}We have completely
depleted the Hokage
Quarter's supply stores.

44
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,857
{\an4}But don't worry; I'll
just go and requisition
some more provisions for
you.

45
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:12,458
{\an1}Please, take a
short break!

46
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,560
Oink!

47
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:20,170
Oink! Oiiiiink!

48
00:03:20,203 --> 00:03:25,177
{\an4}No, absolutely not! What
are you thinking, Lady
Tsunade?! You cannot have
Tonton!

49
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,548
{\an1}What are you saying?!

50
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:28,382
Nothing...

51
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:28,916
Oink?

52
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:30,385
[gasping]

53
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,054
K- Kakashi!

54
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:32,955
{\an1}Huh.

55
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:35,959
{\an1}I'm glad to see
you're looking well.

56
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:38,964
{\an7}I'm not there yet.
I'm just getting started.

57
00:03:39,265 --> 00:03:42,704
After all you've
eaten?! I can't believe
it...

58
00:03:42,738 --> 00:03:47,511
{\an1}I'm quite relieved. I
was dangerously close to
becoming Hokage.

59
00:03:47,545 --> 00:03:52,185
{\an4}But I'm not really the
Hokage type. Given our
situation, we need
someone with more

60
00:03:52,218 --> 00:03:55,790
{\an1}influence to be Hokage,
like you Lady Tsunade.

61
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,464
{\an1}I'm shocked about the
Allied Shinobi Force.

62
00:04:00,497 --> 00:04:05,304
{\an1}I'm amazed the Tsuchikage
Raikage agreed to cooperate.

63
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:09,176
Yes, I know, but that's
how bad the situation
seems to be.

64
00:04:10,212 --> 00:04:12,013
Madara Uchiha.

65
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:14,251
{\an1}Is he really still alive?

66
00:04:16,354 --> 00:04:21,796
{\an4}We don't have proof yet.
But considering what
they're planning to do,
it seems that way.

67
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:24,700
It's another
war, huh?

68
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,507
{\an1}I can't believe the
Uchiha misfortunes now
torment all shinobi.

69
00:04:31,777 --> 00:04:33,179
[sighing]

70
00:04:35,048 --> 00:04:38,955
{\an7}I will call a meeting
of the council. We must
prepare for war!

71
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:25,781
{\an1}"Prophecy of the Great
Lord Elder"

72
00:06:27,182 --> 00:06:28,785
You must rest.

73
00:06:29,318 --> 00:06:36,163
{\an5}It takes time to become
accustomed to the
Mangekyo. Are you in
pain?

74
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,165
{\an1}No.

75
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:42,439
{\an1}They fit quite nicely.
I feel Itachi's visual
prowess.

76
00:06:42,472 --> 00:06:46,344
{\an1}I can tell that I've
already become so much
stronger.

77
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:54,857
{\an1}Orochimaru
forced me into cruel,
harsh labor!

78
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:59,263
{\an1}And then Sasuke took over
and kept ordering poor,
weak me around.

79
00:06:59,297 --> 00:07:02,635
{\an1}His demands were
unreasonable!
[sobbing]

80
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:06,575
{\an1}In the end, he just
treated me like trash!

81
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:09,612
{\an1}[sobbing]
I'm a victim
here, too!

82
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:14,252
{\an1}I see! It must have
been so hard.

83
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:15,588
Oh, please.

84
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:19,762
I don't need your life
story!

85
00:07:19,795 --> 00:07:21,197
{\an1}Say what?

86
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:25,002
{\an1}Give us everything you know
about the Akatsuki, Sasuke
and Kabuto.

87
00:07:25,837 --> 00:07:28,541
And you! Don't get
emotionally involved!

88
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:30,811
You're no good if you're
biased!

89
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:32,614
{\an1}Right. Yes,
sorry, sir!

90
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:38,856
{\an1}Fine. I'll tell you,
but first, you have to
meet my conditions.

91
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,592
What conditions
are those?

92
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,830
{\an1}Well, first of all,
I'm completely famished.

93
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:46,500
{\an1}I want a fried pork
cutlet bowl or no deal!

94
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:48,370
What are you talking
about?!

95
00:07:48,403 --> 00:07:52,177
{\an7}Hm, you know, I didn't
think there was a fried
pork shop in the village.

96
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,916
{\an7}And even if there were,
would it still be in
business under these
circumstances?

97
00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:00,823
{\an5}You know, I heard that
Ichiraku started back up
again in a temporary
location.

98
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,625
{\an1}<i>Is ramen okay? </i>

99
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:05,563
{\an1}<i>No, it has to be a fried</i>
<i>pork cutlet bowl. </i>

100
00:08:05,596 --> 00:08:06,965
[sighing]

101
00:08:06,998 --> 00:08:10,403
{\an1}Hey, wait a minute. What
if we got a delivery from
outside the village?

102
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:13,942
{\an1}Okay, but can't you get
a fried pork cutlet bowl
from a noodle shop?

103
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:16,378
Mmm... it would
take two days.

104
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:19,617
{\an1}Can it! You two are
quite a pair.

105
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,186
Uh... Sorry, sir.

106
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,922
Hm.

You two better get your
act together--

109
00:08:29,532 --> 00:08:36,943
{\an1}I don't get it. What is
this? This entire village
is cheerful and warm.

110
00:08:37,677 --> 00:08:39,347
<i>Just like him...</i>

111

{\an1}Hey, Naruto! Haven't
seen you around for a
while. Where you been?

112
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,958
{\an1}Oh, you know, just around
I guess!

113
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:54,002
{\an4}It gets lonely when we
don't see you. Your

village the energy to recover.

see that?

really big, I just know
it!

00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:11,427
{\an7}Just look at him, smiling
like that. Yuck!

121
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:13,965
This is a problem.

122
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:18,638
We in the mass media
have created some sort of
terrible monster.

down a peg or two, the

I wonder where he's
headed right now...

00:09:27,185 --> 00:09:30,156
{\an1}Wherever it is, I'm sure
that it's nowhere good!

127
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:33,460
{\an1}All right, now, let's
get ready to capture the
moment, 'kay?

longer!

144
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:27,174
Hold on! You're
Konohamaru!

145
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:29,478
{\an1}I'm so not Konohamaru!

146
00:10:29,512 --> 00:10:31,247
[grunting]
Darn it!

147

00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:35,421
{\an1}Hey, wait up!

00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,823
[panting]

150
00:10:37,856 --> 00:10:40,593
{\an1}[chuckling]
In that case,
I'll do this!

151
00:10:40,627 --> 00:10:42,998
{\an1}Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

152
00:10:46,837 --> 00:10:48,373
{\an1}You can't get
away that easy!

153
00:10:48,406 --> 00:10:50,076
{\an1}Harem Jutsu!

154
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:51,677
Huh?!

155
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,415
{\an1}I just want to talk with
the big hero, Naruto!

156
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:57,986
{\an1}What are you running
from? What, are you
afraid of little old us?

157
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,689
{\an1}You going to meet
someone?

158
00:11:00,524 --> 00:11:03,428
{\an1}On your way to a hot
date or something,
Naruto?!

159
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:08,570
[screaming]

160
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:13,410
{\an1}Oh, boy.

161
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,147
{\an1}The village hero, huh?

162
00:11:18,284 --> 00:11:19,819
{\an1}However...

163
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:24,927
{\an1}Aw, come back! Where are
you going?!

164
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:38,213
{\an8}That time when Naruto
stood up to Pain to
protect me...

165
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:41,619
{\an8}The Nine-Tails began
to emerge from Naruto's
body.

166
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,267
[screaming]

167
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,888
{\an1}What's that?!

168
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,564
Do you hate
me now?!

169
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:48,385
{\an1}I could feel its intense
anger.

170
00:12:48,952 --> 00:12:53,660
{\an1}But I- In that moment I
couldn't feel anything
of Naruto's will anymore.

171
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:56,564
{\an1}<i>It was like...</i>

172
00:12:56,597 --> 00:12:59,702
{\an1}<i>Its anger had taken</i>
<i>over.</i>

173
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:02,673
{\an7}Naruto's heart
lost in the Nine-Tails.

174
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:04,876
[sighing]

175
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:13,456
{\an5}Well, the First Hokage's
necklace that Naruto got
from Lady Tsunade is
gone...

176
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,627
If the Nine-Tails were
to emerge and run loose
now...

177
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:20,500
{\an1}Let's be honest, I
don't think even I
could stop it anymore.

178
00:13:25,006 --> 00:13:31,449
{\an4}<i>True... it would be</i>
<i>tremendously risky to</i>
<i>take on the Akatsuki with</i>
<i>the Nine-Tails inside of him.</i>

179
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:33,485
{\an1}But...

180
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:36,957
{\an1}[panting]

181
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:38,226
Yeah, hold up!

182
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,229
{\an1}<i>He's Naruto.</i>

183
00:13:40,797 --> 00:13:43,100
{\an1}<i>He's not the</i>
<i>Nine-Tails.</i>

184
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:50,478
{\an4}<i>For this battle, we</i>
<i>don't need the</i>
<i>Nine-Tails... we need</i>
<i>Naruto's strength.</i>

185
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:54,651
{\an4}<i>If it looks like the</i>
<i>Nine-Tails is taking</i>
<i>over, we'll have to stop</i>
<i>it. </i>

186
00:13:54,684 --> 00:14:01,260
{\an4}<i>That's right. This is</i>
<i>also a battle to protect</i>
<i>Naruto from the Akatsuki</i>
<i>and the Nine-Tails.</i>

187
00:14:01,294 --> 00:14:08,104
{\an7}That's how I- No,...
I'm sure this is how
all of my classmates
feel.

188
00:14:08,137 --> 00:14:12,511
{\an1}<i>We protect Naruto.</i>
<i>And we will fight</i>
<i>with him.</i>

189
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:29,703
{\an1}<i>I wonder what Lady</i>
<i>Tsunade thinks.</i>

190
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,939
All right, is
everyone here?

191
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,712
{\an1}Then we'll begin the
war council to discuss
our strategy.

192
00:14:36,514 --> 00:14:40,520
{\an1}Assemble ninja tools
and stock reserves of
food.

193
00:14:40,553 --> 00:14:46,695
{\an4}Assign all shinobi to
a main battle unit or
support groups and ponder
how to further group

194
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:48,931
{\an1}platoons within the main
unit.

195
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:51,702
{\an1}And bring me a full list
of all our shinobi!

196
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:57,311
It's war, then. So
it's finally come to
that.

197
00:14:57,344 --> 00:15:01,216
{\an1}You were appointed to the
war council, but you're
still young.

198
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:03,587
{\an1}Just watch and don't
miss a thing.

199
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:06,624
{\an1}<i>Yeah, don't worry.</i>
<i>I know.</i>

200
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,566
{\an1}I'll use every brain
cell. And hammer
everything in.

201
00:15:17,006 --> 00:15:18,710
{\an1}Guess I finally lost
them.

202
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:23,282
{\an1}And now at long last I
can enjoy my love to the
absolute fullest!

203
00:15:23,584 --> 00:15:27,423
{\an1}Old man! One large
tonkotsu with extra pork!

{\an1}Huh?

00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:36,636
What?! So Granny
Tsunade's all right?!

208
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,205
Mm-hmm!

209
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,406
{\an3}Yes!

210
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,913
{\an1}That's great! What good
news about Lady Tsunade!

211
00:15:42,946 --> 00:15:46,284
{\an1}Right! To celebrate,
the ramen's on me!

213
00:15:47,786 --> 00:15:49,856
You too, Sakura; pull up
a seat!

214
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,996
{\an1}Thanks, but no. I can't
stay. I've got to tell
everyone!

215
00:15:54,028 --> 00:15:57,300
{\an1}Well, I'll see you
later, Naruto! Bye!

than ever!

Hokage's recovery!

{\an1}Thanks, Teuchi, for the-

223
00:16:20,602 --> 00:16:23,639

{\an1}Very well, then... Listen
carefully.

couldn't see too clearly,

{\an1}I don't want to
understand you.

270
00:19:17,098 --> 00:19:22,106

least I'll take you
down first.

271
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,881
{\an7}No problem... since it's
clear that you still
don't respect me at
all...

272
00:19:27,915 --> 00:19:34,557
{\an4}Enough, Naruto. I'll
handle Sasuke. You have
to pursue your dream of
becoming Hokage.

{\an1}I won't let Sasuke take
you down with him.

00:19:37,562 --> 00:19:39,932
But I'm not worthy of
being Hokage...

275
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:42,203
{\an1}...if I can't even save a
friend.

{\an1}Fine, Sasuke...

00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:46,943
{\an1}I'll fight you!

00:19:49,914 --> 00:19:53,019
{\an1}Have you seen it, too?

279
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:54,088
Yeah.

280
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:57,893
{\an1}And he whose power lies
in his eyes...

281
00:19:57,926 --> 00:20:01,665
{\an1}Do you know who and what
he is as well, then?

282
00:20:01,698 --> 00:20:05,938
{\an1}Mm-hmm. And I've
made up my mind.

you stored yourself in
Naruto.

{\an1}Wait a minute,
you did?!

285
00:20:17,188 --> 00:20:20,961
{\an1}Give him the key to the
Fourth Hokage's seal.

00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,665
{\an1}All right...

00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:26,937
{\an1}But only because you say
so, Great Lord Elder.

288
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:35,249
What is this?

289
00:20:35,282 --> 00:20:40,690
{\an4}The key left by the
Fourth Hokage to lock and
unlock the sealing jutsu
on your belly!

290
00:20:40,723 --> 00:20:45,864
{\an1}With this, you could even
let the Nine-Tails out to
run free, if you wanted.

291
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,535
{\an1}Mm.

292
00:20:49,136 --> 00:20:52,574
{\an1}Just press your hand down
on that square area.

293
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:04,993
{\an4}Once you do, you'll also
have obtained the means
to perfect that jutsu. The
one Jiraiya told you about.

294
00:21:07,063 --> 00:21:09,433
{\an1}That's the key to release
it...?

295
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:12,270
{\an1}The Nine-Tails
seal?

296
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:20,816
{\an1}Are you having some
doubts, Naruto?

297
00:22:58,563 --> 00:23:02,902
{\an1}<i>In real battle,...</i>
<i>feelings of hate are</i>
<i>bound to come out. </i>

298
00:23:02,935 --> 00:23:06,874
{\an1}<i>So I thought I didn't</i>
<i>want Nine-Tails' power</i>
<i>anymore. </i>

299
00:23:06,908 --> 00:23:12,183
{\an1}<i>But then again... I need</i>
<i>the Nine-Tails' chakra in</i>
<i>order to fight Sasuke. </i>

300
00:23:12,584 --> 00:23:14,819
{\an1}<i>I can't hide from that</i>
<i>forever. </i>

301
00:23:15,321 --> 00:23:19,260
{\an1}<i>Well... no use getting</i>
<i>depressed! </i>

302
00:23:19,294 --> 00:23:22,998
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: Storage. </i>

303
00:23:23,032 --> 00:23:25,870
<i>Dad, I'm gonna</i>
<i>conquer this control</i>
<i>thing!</i>
