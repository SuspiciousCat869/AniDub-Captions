-How's it going?

4
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:34,224
Are you able to control the
Nine-Tails' chakra easily,

00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:35,560
Tenzo?

00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:38,164
-Everything seems to be
under control so far.

7
00:00:38,197 --> 00:00:40,134
But Kakashi, please
don't call me Tenzo.

I'm Yamato right now.

-Almost.

00:00:53,556 --> 00:00:55,694
Hey, there's a tear in mine.

13
00:00:55,694 --> 00:00:57,530
It's finally working.

-Ah, no fair.

00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:01,235
I can't get mine to
do anything at all.

-Ha.

17
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:02,846
Ha.

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,816
Well, I guess that just
means I'm better than you.

19
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,486
-What do you mean
better than me?

20
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,188
You are me.

-Ah man, how'd that one
of me get to be so good?

24
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:16,569
I think I need a change of plan.

25
00:01:22,646 --> 00:01:26,352
Kakashi Sensei, I was wondering,
can I ask you a question?

26
00:01:26,385 --> 00:01:27,254
-What is it?

27
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,489
-Is there anyone
else in the Leaf

28
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:31,494
Village who's got a wind
chakra nature like mine?

29
00:01:31,494 --> 00:01:33,130
-You want their advice.

30
00:01:33,164 --> 00:01:33,764
Is that it?

31
00:01:33,764 --> 00:01:34,766
-Mhm.

32
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:36,335
-Hm.

33
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:39,741
Well, there is one
person I can think of.

34
00:01:39,774 --> 00:01:43,681
Knowing him, he's probably
playing shogi right now.

going to be treating us

39
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,923
to the dinner and party after
our next assignment, Sensei.

40

SHIKAMARU: Oh, it's you, Naruto.

00:03:47,838 --> 00:03:49,507
ASUMA: What's up?

46
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,477
-There's something I really
need to ask you about

47
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,946
if you've got a minute.

48
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:53,546
-Hm.

49
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:05,634
-Tricks for mastering wind
change in chakra nature, huh?

50
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:06,602
-Come on.

51
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:07,771
Don't tell me
you're really doing

52
00:04:07,804 --> 00:04:09,507
change in chakra
nature training.

53
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,909
-Yeah.

54
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:12,612
-You sure you're up for it?

55
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:15,550
You gotta be pretty darn
sharp to master that stuff.

56
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:16,719
-I know.

57
00:04:16,752 --> 00:04:18,990
That's why I came to get
some tips from Asuma Sensei,

58
00:04:19,023 --> 00:04:21,627
because you've got the
same wind chakra as I do.

59
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,864
Right, Sensei?

60
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,000
-Huh.

61
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:27,437
I never would have pegged
you for a wind nature.

62
00:04:27,437 --> 00:04:28,939
What do you know about that?

63
00:04:28,972 --> 00:04:30,308
-Please, Sensei.

64
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:32,979
I need you to teach me how
to master it right away.

65
00:04:40,492 --> 00:04:41,694
-Well, let's see now.

66
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:44,031
I might be inclined to do
it if you agree to pick up

67
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:47,737
the tab for Team Asuma's next
post-mission barbecue dinner.

68
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:49,040
-Hey, that's not cool.

69
00:04:49,073 --> 00:04:49,707
-Well?

70
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:59,023
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I can
probably just cover it,

71
00:04:59,023 --> 00:05:00,693
but it'll clean me out.

72
00:05:00,726 --> 00:05:03,296
I'll be totally broke.

73
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,967
Well, all right.

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,803
If it will get you to help me.

75
00:05:06,836 --> 00:05:07,737
-OK.

76
00:05:07,737 --> 00:05:08,706
It's a deal then.

77
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,449
See these.

78
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:17,687
They're my chakra blades.

79
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:20,659
They're forged from a special
type of metal that can actually

80
00:05:20,692 --> 00:05:23,397
absorb the bearer's
chakra nature.

81
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,031
-Whoa.

82
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:25,500
Sweet.

83
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,472
-Here take one.

84
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:29,541
OK.

85
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:31,343
Now try sending your
chakra into the blade.

86
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:31,827
-All right.

87
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:38,104
I did it.

88
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,107
But my chakra comes
out looking a lot

89
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:42,077
different than yours, Sensei.

90
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:43,446
-Now, listen up.

91
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,585
To activate it, imagine
your chakra splitting in two

92
00:05:46,585 --> 00:05:48,655
and grinding against each other.

93
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:50,591
-Grinding them?

94
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:52,495
-Just as if you were
finely sharpening

95
00:05:52,528 --> 00:05:55,198
the blade between the two
halves of your chakra.

96
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:59,139
-Sharpening the blade
between the two halves, huh?

97
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:00,041
-Exactly.

98
00:06:00,074 --> 00:06:02,010
Finely and sharply.

99
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,880
That's the trick.

100
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,620
-OK, but you know, there's
something I don't get.

101
00:06:07,653 --> 00:06:08,822
-What?

102
00:06:08,855 --> 00:06:11,025
-What's the point of using
this wind change of nature

103
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:14,732
when the ninja tools we have
are already sharp to begin with?

104
00:06:14,732 --> 00:06:16,635
I mean going to all
the trouble and effort

105
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,106
of pouring your chakra
into these special blades.

106
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,042
What's wrong with
the ones we've got?

107
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:23,814
Seems to me it'd be better
and a whole lot easier

108
00:06:23,847 --> 00:06:24,881
just to use them.

109
00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:26,184
-You think so?

110
00:06:26,217 --> 00:06:29,155
Maybe if I let you
see for yourself.

111
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,624
All right.

112
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:32,528
Let's you and me both try
hitting that tree over there

113
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:35,900
with our chakra blades
at the same time.

114
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,136
-Why do that?

115
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:38,705
-Just do it.

116
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:39,188
You'll see.

117
00:06:42,293 --> 00:06:43,094
Ready.

118
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:43,695
Go.

119
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:54,914
-Whoa.

120
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,150
Amazing.

121
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,820
Yours not only went
right through the tree,

122
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:02,861
it penetrated that
boulder right behind it.

123
00:07:02,861 --> 00:07:05,966
-I held back a little
just to be safe.

124
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:09,071
I could've made it go
through the boulder too.

125
00:07:09,104 --> 00:07:11,242
When two shinobi
of equal abilities

126
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:14,247
face each other with
blades, the sharper blade

127
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,850
will often decide the outcome.

128
00:07:16,884 --> 00:07:19,622
The wind change in
nature is best suited

129
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:21,726
to close and medium
range combat.

130
00:07:21,726 --> 00:07:23,128
Got it?

131
00:07:23,128 --> 00:07:26,600
You know, there aren't too
many wind types like us around.

132
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:27,201
-There aren't.

133
00:07:27,234 --> 00:07:28,804
Really?

134
00:07:28,838 --> 00:07:31,876
-Drop by anytime if there's
anything more you want to know.

135
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:34,280
As long as you're willing to
pay for dinner, of course.

136
00:07:34,313 --> 00:07:35,282
-You got it.

137
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:36,617
Thanks a lot, Sensei.

138
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:42,294
-So that was a Shadow
Clone the whole time?

139
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:43,896
-Poor Naruto.

140
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:47,135
He'll be sorry when he remembers
that Choji's on our team.

141
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:48,170
-You're cruel, Sensei.

142
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:52,778
He doesn't have much time.

143
00:07:52,811 --> 00:07:55,616
You really think he can
master a new ninjutsu

144
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,686
before the Akatsuki show up?

145
00:07:57,719 --> 00:07:58,955
-Well, we'll see.

146
00:07:58,988 --> 00:07:59,990
Won't we?

147
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:01,358
-Don't you think
it would be better

148
00:08:01,593 --> 00:08:04,631
to just hide Naruto
safely somewhere, now

149
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:07,134
before the Akatsuki
try to make contact.

150
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:09,906
-That's a decision for
the Fifth Hokage to make.

151
00:08:18,854 --> 00:08:20,190
-So that's how you do it.

152
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,925
I get it.

153
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:21,441
-Right.

154
00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:22,108
Here we go.

155
00:08:22,141 --> 00:08:24,112
-Let's do it.

156
00:08:24,145 --> 00:08:25,448
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Looks like he

157
00:08:25,681 --> 00:08:28,853
got some useful tips from Asuma.

158
00:08:28,886 --> 00:08:30,422
And he's already
learned how to profit

159
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:33,961
from the individual experiences
of his Shadow Clones.

160
00:08:33,994 --> 00:08:36,866
Hm.

161
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:37,868
-Uh.

162
00:08:37,868 --> 00:08:38,309
Naruto.

163
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:45,221
It says here when a friend
is engaged in strenuous work

164
00:08:45,255 --> 00:08:49,462
or play, the thoughtful thing to
do is to bring him refreshment.

165
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,934
Lack of refreshments is the
least of his worries right now.

166
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:06,056
[grunting]

167
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:14,411
-Come on.

168
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,339
-My lady, we've
received disturbing news

169
00:09:31,373 --> 00:09:33,577
that a village near the
border of the Land of Fire

170
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,947
has come under attack.

171
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,018
-Was it the Akatsuki?

172
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:40,054
-Always a possibility,
but evidence

173
00:09:40,087 --> 00:09:43,293
suggests the attack came from
the Village Hidden in the Rain.

174
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:44,028
-What?

175
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:45,129
Why?

176
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:47,033
What could their motive be?

177
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:48,902
Don't they realize
this could lead to all

178
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:51,273
out war between the
neighboring lands?

179
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:52,441
-Perhaps.

180
00:09:52,474 --> 00:09:54,445
Perhaps, they're trying to
take advantage of the fact

181
00:09:54,445 --> 00:09:57,150
that the Akatsuki
are after Naruto.

182
00:09:57,183 --> 00:10:00,155
-They couldn't really be so
shortsighted, could they?

183
00:10:00,188 --> 00:10:01,924
Whatever the case
may be, we have

184
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,328
to get to the bottom of it.

185
00:10:04,361 --> 00:10:05,530
Summon Asuma.

186
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,899
-My lady.

187
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,904
But uh, that will mean
fewer jonin in the village.

188
00:10:09,937 --> 00:10:13,844
And what if the Akatsuki
come for Naruto.

189
00:10:13,877 --> 00:10:16,314
We'd have a hard
time protecting him.

190
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:16,916
-Hm.

191
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:20,923
-All right.

192
00:10:20,923 --> 00:10:22,859
Lock your clones'
cumulative experiences

193
00:10:22,892 --> 00:10:23,961
into your memory bank.

194
00:10:23,995 --> 00:10:25,330
-Huh.

195
00:10:25,364 --> 00:10:29,536
-Now break the jutsu and
reflect on the exercise.

196
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,538
-(CROWD) Yes, sir.

197
00:10:30,572 --> 00:10:31,172
-Right.

198
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:32,008
Here we go.

199
00:11:02,592 --> 00:11:04,095
-I'm close.

200
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:05,497
I've almost got it down.

201
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,944
-Trouble is, along with all
that cumulative experience,

202
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:17,484
there comes cumulative
fatigue as well.

203
00:11:17,517 --> 00:11:18,986
-I know.

204
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,891
I knew from the start
it wouldn't be easy,

205
00:11:21,925 --> 00:11:23,059
but I'm so close.

206
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:24,595
I'm almost there.

207
00:11:24,628 --> 00:11:27,266
-Why don't we take
a break, Naruto?

208
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,904
-This is not the time
to be taking it easy.

209
00:11:29,938 --> 00:11:31,507
I'm OK, Kakashi Sensei.

210
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:33,510
Really.

211
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:36,148
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu.

212
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:36,616
-Huh.

213
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:37,484
Hey, hold on.

214
00:11:37,517 --> 00:11:39,988
Wait a second.

215
00:11:39,988 --> 00:11:42,659
[groaning]

216
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,101
-Wow.

217
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:49,637
Incredible.

218
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,508
Your work ethic is
impressive, Naruto.

219
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,385
-Well, I guess he can handle it.

220
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,422
After all, his stamina
is off the charts.

221
00:12:06,098 --> 00:12:07,133
-Here you go.

222
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:07,600
-Perfect.

223
00:12:07,634 --> 00:12:09,136
Thanks.

224
00:12:09,136 --> 00:12:10,338
-Who are they for?

225
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:14,145
-Oh, no one in particular.

226
00:12:14,145 --> 00:12:15,548
Well, uh, see you later.

227
00:12:15,548 --> 00:12:18,152
-Say hi to Kurenai
Sensei for me.

228
00:12:18,186 --> 00:12:19,253
-Oh.

229
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:21,391
How, how did she know?

230
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:23,027
[giggling]

231
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,029
-Oh look.

232
00:12:24,062 --> 00:12:25,263
There he is.

233
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:28,970
-Sorry to interrupt you on
your way to see Kurenai Sensei.

234
00:12:29,003 --> 00:12:31,373
-How do you guys
know where I'm--

235
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:32,409
-Come on.

236
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:33,477
Don't try to hide it.

237
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:34,145
Everyone--

238
00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:34,646
-Shikamaru.

239
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,283
-Oh yeah, right.

240
00:12:37,317 --> 00:12:39,120
We just received the word.

241
00:12:39,154 --> 00:12:42,626
The Fifth Hokage wants the whole
Team Asuma, Choji, Ino, you

242
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:45,264
and me to assemble
on the double.

243
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,566
-She does?

244
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:47,701
-Really?

245
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:49,571
She wants to see all of
us from the old Squad 10.

246
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:50,339
-That's right.

247
00:12:54,112 --> 00:12:54,679
-Let's go then.

248
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:02,225
-The four of you, Asuma
Sarutobi, Shikamaru Nara,

249
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:04,563
Ino Yamanaka, and
Choji Akimichi are

250
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:07,034
to investigate what's behind
this attack on the border

251
00:13:07,034 --> 00:13:07,568
village.

252
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:08,703
-(ALL TOGETHER) Right.

253
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:11,508
-We know the Akatsuki
are on the move again,

254
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,544
so handle this with great care.

255
00:13:13,578 --> 00:13:15,147
-In the meantime,
what about Naruto?

256
00:13:21,257 --> 00:13:23,160
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): A
nice safe D-rank mission

257
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:24,262
is just the thing.

258
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,202
Grave-robbers, huh?

259
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,147
-(ALL TOGETHER) Yeah!

260
00:13:43,728 --> 00:13:44,630
-All right.

261
00:13:44,663 --> 00:13:45,665
I nailed it.

262
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,499
Whoa.

263
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,169
I really am awesome, aren't I?

264
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:52,009
At this rate, I'll have this
new jutsu down in no time.

265
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:54,446
-If it's coming quickly, it's
because of this new training

266
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:57,719
method, which-- let us
not forget-- was my idea.

267
00:13:57,752 --> 00:13:59,988
-Oh, and by the way,
I'd like to think

268
00:14:00,022 --> 00:14:02,727
that I helped out a
little bit, Kakashi.

269
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:07,735
-OK.

270
00:14:07,735 --> 00:14:09,037
Whatever.

271
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,339
Can we just get on to
the next exercise now?

272
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:15,782
-Of course, none
of it could have

273
00:14:16,015 --> 00:14:19,621
been done if you
weren't you, Naruto.

274
00:14:19,621 --> 00:14:21,492
-Naruto.

275
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:24,630
-Yamato, we'll take a short
break until he recovers.

276
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,433
-Understood.

277
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,603
-Is Naruto all right?

278
00:14:28,637 --> 00:14:31,107
-A little rest, and
he should be fine.

279
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:34,413
This kid is really
something else.

280
00:14:34,446 --> 00:14:35,148
-Sensei.

281
00:14:35,181 --> 00:14:36,283
-Hm.

282
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:38,086
What is it, Sakura?

283
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:39,088
-Lady Tsunade needs you.

284
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:13,378
-Huh.

285
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,248
Asuma Sensei.

286
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,183
-All right.

287
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:18,053
Looks like everyone's here.

288
00:15:18,086 --> 00:15:18,620
-Hey look.

289
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:19,789
What do you think?

290
00:15:19,822 --> 00:15:20,657
-Hm.

291
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:21,558
About what?

292
00:15:21,592 --> 00:15:22,527
-Come on.

293
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:24,463
Don't you notice
anything, Sensei?

294
00:15:24,497 --> 00:15:27,268
-Huh?

295
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,537
-Come on, Sensei.

296
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,473
It's the first time you've
seen us all gathered together,

297
00:15:30,507 --> 00:15:32,410
wearing these
earrings you gave us.

298
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:40,657
ASUMA: Congratulations,
Choji, Ino.

299
00:15:40,657 --> 00:15:41,592
Well done.

300
00:15:41,626 --> 00:15:44,062
Since Shikamaru
passed last time,

301
00:15:44,096 --> 00:15:45,799
that means all the
members of Squad 10

302
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,838
are now officially
chunin, and it also

303
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:53,077
means that I will no longer
be in charge of you guys.

304
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:56,284
From here on out you're
leaders in your own right.

305
00:15:56,284 --> 00:15:59,422
Each of you will be
given a new team to lead.

306
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:04,430
These earrings are my gift to
you to celebrate your success.

307
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,668
Whatever the future
holds, never forget

308
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:08,337
you were members of Squad 10.

309
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:12,544
Yes, of course.

310
00:16:12,578 --> 00:16:15,148
It's the first time we've all
been together for a while,

311
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:15,590
isn't it?

312
00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:21,199
NARUTO: I can't believe I
have to stop my training just

313
00:16:21,232 --> 00:16:22,468
to go on some lame mission.

314
00:16:22,468 --> 00:16:24,170
-A mission's a mission.

315
00:16:24,204 --> 00:16:25,172
We have no choice.

316
00:16:25,206 --> 00:16:26,341
-Yeah.

317
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,380
But it's not like this
mission is an important one.

318
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:31,516
Who cares about a
bunch of grave robbers,

319
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:36,392
and why's Grandma Tsunade
wasting our time on them?

320
00:16:36,425 --> 00:16:37,393
-Hey, Naruto.

321
00:16:37,426 --> 00:16:38,228
How you doing?

322
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:39,430
What's up with your training?

323
00:16:39,463 --> 00:16:42,435
-Suspended on account
of some stupid mission.

324
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,605
-Ino, are you guys
heading out now too?

325
00:16:44,638 --> 00:16:45,440
-That's right.

326
00:16:45,473 --> 00:16:46,541
We're all together again.

327
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:49,446
KONOHAMARU: Hey, what
are you all doing here?

328
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:50,148
-Konohamaru.

329
00:16:50,181 --> 00:16:50,882
-So what?

330
00:16:50,915 --> 00:16:52,484
You off on another
mission, Naruto?

331
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:54,355
-Unfortunately.

332
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,591
Still looking for lost cats?

333
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,894
-[laugh] That's right.

334
00:16:57,927 --> 00:16:59,897
This is the seventh
one I've found.

335
00:16:59,897 --> 00:17:02,568
If you ask me, I'm getting
to be a real expert at it.

336
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:03,770
-Good work.

337
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:04,772
You hang in there.

338
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:05,807
-Will do.

339
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,244
Well, I guess I better
go file my report.

340
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,647
-See you later, Konohamaru.

341
00:17:09,647 --> 00:17:11,216
-Bye, Uncle Asuma.

342
00:17:11,249 --> 00:17:12,585
Good hunting.

343
00:17:12,618 --> 00:17:14,856
-Did he call you Uncle Asuma?

344
00:17:14,889 --> 00:17:16,258
I don't get it.

345
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:17,861
What's up with that?

346
00:17:17,894 --> 00:17:19,430
-What are you talking about?

347
00:17:19,464 --> 00:17:21,800
He called him "uncle,"
because Asuma's his uncle.

348
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:22,769
What do you think?

349
00:17:22,802 --> 00:17:23,636
-Say what?

350
00:17:23,636 --> 00:17:24,772
Then he's--

351
00:17:24,772 --> 00:17:25,707
-Yeah.

352
00:17:25,741 --> 00:17:27,210
He's the son of
the Third Hokage.

353
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:28,479
You didn't know that?

354
00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:29,881
-I had no idea.

355
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:30,448
-No.

356
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,953
Me neither.

357
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:36,358
-Well, what of it?

358
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:39,196
NARUTO: I never knew you
were the old man's son.

359
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,368
And to think we have
the same chakra nature.

360
00:17:42,401 --> 00:17:43,670
Amazing.

361
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,575
It makes me feel like we've got
a special bond or something.

362
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:48,779
-Well, just make
sure to keep training

363
00:17:48,812 --> 00:17:50,516
even while you're
on your mission.

364
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:54,789
And don't forget what I told
you, finely and sharply.

365
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,793
-Don't worry, I won't.

366
00:17:56,793 --> 00:17:57,795
All right, Team Yamato.

367
00:17:57,795 --> 00:18:00,565
Let's get this mission started.

368
00:18:00,598 --> 00:18:01,233
-OK.

369
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:02,502
Hey, wait up.

370
00:18:02,536 --> 00:18:05,274
-Naruto.

371
00:18:05,274 --> 00:18:07,343
-So you're leading the team?

372
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,546
-Yes.

373
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,951
It seems Kakashi has a
different mission right now.

374
00:18:11,984 --> 00:18:13,654
-Protect Naruto.

375
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:14,889
Look after him.

376
00:18:14,923 --> 00:18:15,925
-Yes, sir.

377
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,761
-Hey, Captain Yamato.

378
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:18,596
Come on.

379
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:19,764
We're ready.

380
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:22,268
-I'd better go.

381
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:22,743
Coming.

382
00:18:22,776 --> 00:18:23,311
Coming.

383
00:18:25,948 --> 00:18:26,817
-All right.

384
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,419
It's time we were off as well.

385
00:18:32,627 --> 00:18:34,496
-He's progressing
phenomenally quickly,

386
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:36,901
but he's still got a ways to go.

387
00:18:36,934 --> 00:18:39,872
A new jutsu like this one
isn't mastered easily.

388
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:40,673
-Yes.

389
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:41,875
I know.

390
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:44,613
Listen, I'm sorry
about this, Kakashi,

391
00:18:44,647 --> 00:18:47,051
but it's essential you
rendezvous with Jaraiya

392
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:49,789
and keep tabs on the Akatsuki.

393
00:18:49,822 --> 00:18:52,794
I wish we had time to let
Naruto focus on his training,

394
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:54,897
but it can't be
helped right now.

395
00:18:54,897 --> 00:18:56,533
-He wants to get it
over with quickly,

396
00:18:56,566 --> 00:18:58,704
so he's pushing
himself to the limit.

397
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,573
My worry is that
the result could

398
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,510
be an eruption of
the Nine-Tails' power

399
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:05,315
that not even Yamato
would be able to control.

400
00:19:05,348 --> 00:19:07,752
I don't think I'm
making a mistake here.

401
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,608
[crying]

402
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,829
-Look at them.

403
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:38,904
See how they grieve,
their tears, their anger.

404
00:19:38,904 --> 00:19:42,543
The Land of Fire has
no need for neighbors.

405
00:19:42,577 --> 00:19:47,318
Words are wasted when people
cannot understand each other.

406
00:19:47,351 --> 00:19:51,725
At last, the Land of
Fire will rise and assume

407
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,365
its place on the tallest
mountain top for all the world

408
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:56,934
to look up to.

409
00:19:56,934 --> 00:20:00,673
But for that to happen,
the decayed and rotten Leaf

410
00:20:00,673 --> 00:20:03,378
must be torn away.

411
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:07,786
The time has come to
awaken the Land of Fire.

412
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,664
-Let's wrap this up quick,
so I can get back to training

413
00:20:14,664 --> 00:20:15,565
already.

414
00:20:15,598 --> 00:20:16,934
-Better be careful.

415
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,437
Don't go taking
this lightly just

416
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,906
cause it's a D-rank mission.

417
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:20,841
-Huh.

418
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:22,043
Don't worry I won't.

419
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:32,026
[theme music]

420
00:22:00,174 --> 00:22:01,710
-I can't believe
Grandma Tsunade's

421
00:22:01,743 --> 00:22:03,879
got us chasing
after grave robbers.

422
00:22:03,913 --> 00:22:05,048
What a waste of time.

423
00:22:05,082 --> 00:22:06,584
SAKURA: Hey, it's our mission.

424
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:07,519
Complaining about
it doesn't help.

425
00:22:07,553 --> 00:22:08,722
NARUTO: Yeah, but--

426
00:22:08,755 --> 00:22:10,591
YAMATO: Besides, there's
something different going on

427
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:11,860
here.

428
00:22:11,893 --> 00:22:13,696
Your typical grave robber is
nothing but a thief plundering

429
00:22:13,696 --> 00:22:15,597
buried coins and
jewelry from the dead.

430
00:22:15,597 --> 00:22:17,232
However, these
grave robbers seem

431
00:22:17,265 --> 00:22:19,401
to be after something
other than buried loot.

432
00:22:19,401 --> 00:22:20,402
NARUTO: What do you mean?

433
00:22:20,435 --> 00:22:21,936
YAMATO: I don't know
for certain yet,

434
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,273
but there's definitely a
different motive at work here.

435
00:22:25,273 --> 00:22:27,809
NARUTO: Next time,
"Deprived of Eternal Sleep."

436
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:28,293
