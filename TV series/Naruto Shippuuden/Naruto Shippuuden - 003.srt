the Fifth Hokage's been
teaching her more than just

If I don't, she's gonna kill me.

her chakra together, focuses it

into her fist, and
releases it all at once.

After all, she's more
of a genjutsu type.

99
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,019
She might just become a better
kunoichi than the Fifth Hokage.

The first thing a
shinobi must learn

is to conceal his presence
and remain hidden.

conceal their movements

TSUNADE NARRATING:
Intelligence research report

340
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:44,597
by the ANBU Black
Ops-- Akatsuki.

341
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,132
The Akatsuki is a
mysterious organization

342
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,801
created by a group
of shinobi who

343
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,569
abandoned their own villages.

344
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,338
The organization
was created in order

345
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,340
to accomplish a common goal.

346
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,343
They wear dark robes embroidered
with a red cloud pattern

347
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,645
and engage in covert activities.

348
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,714
It is believed that
Orochimaru was once

349
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:04,950
affiliated with
this organization.

350
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:07,419
The Leaf has only encountered
two of its members.

351
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,722
Sasuke's older brother,
Itachi Uchiha--

352
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,191
he possesses the
Mangekyo Sharingan

353
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,326
and destroyed the Uchiha clan.

354
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,263
The other is Kisame
Hoshigaki, the former Phantom

355
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:19,632
of the Hidden Mist.

356
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,500
During the initial
contact, three

357
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,904
of the Leaf's most skilled
jonin, Kakashi, Asuma,

358
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:28,974
and Kurenai, were
defeated by this pair.

359
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:32,678
The Akatsuki's objective is
to obtain Naruto's Nine-Tails.

360
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:36,048
It remains unclear what
they intend to use it for.

361
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,984
Further investigation
is required.
