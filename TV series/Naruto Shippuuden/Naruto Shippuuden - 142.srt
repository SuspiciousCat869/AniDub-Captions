1
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:16,696
-Kakashi.

2
00:00:24,468 --> 00:00:26,003
- If even the
faintest scent still

3
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:29,137
{\an1}lingers from when
Sasuke was here.

4
00:00:29,137 --> 00:00:31,440
{\an1}-Yeah, that's right.

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,276
{\an1}No way we're giving up
after coming this far.

6
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:38,612
{\an1}- We'll just keep
searching until we

7
00:00:38,612 --> 00:00:40,212
can't find any
trace of his scent.

8
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,629
-Byakugan.

9
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,429
Nothing.

10
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:08,131
{\an1}We have to find him.

11
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:08,264
-Sasuke.

12
00:01:29,947 --> 00:01:31,848
[whine]

13
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:34,883
{\an1}-Yeah, I know it.

14
00:01:34,883 --> 00:01:36,118
{\an1}There's no trace of it.

15
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:37,518
{\an1}His scent is gone.

16
00:01:41,955 --> 00:01:42,489
-Damn it.

17
00:01:45,924 --> 00:01:46,391
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Where did you go?

18
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:03,403
{\an1}We've done all we
could, but now it's

19
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:05,370
{\an1}time we went back
to the Hidden Leaf.

20
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,439
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sasuke.

21
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,572
[theme music]

22
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:58,381
{\an1}TOBI: What are you doing?

23
00:03:58,381 --> 00:04:01,817
{\an1}The preparations are
already completed.

24
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:04,153
{\an1}- Whenever I look
upon the full moon,

25
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:06,855
{\an1}it takes me back to that night.

26
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:09,256
Memories.

27
00:04:09,256 --> 00:04:12,892
I've been trying
so hard to forget.

28
00:04:12,892 --> 00:04:16,595
{\an1}I can finally recall
things about Itachi.

29
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:20,030
{\an1}Faint memories that were
buried deed in my heart

30
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:20,597
{\an1}and now floating back
up to the surface.

31
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,202
{\an1}-By all means, flee.

32
00:04:27,202 --> 00:04:30,303
{\an1}Cling to your retched life.

33
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:33,439
{\an1}And when you possess the same
eyes as me, come and face me.

34
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,353
-No, wait!

35
00:05:36,516 --> 00:05:40,219
{\an1}-I saw him crying then.

36
00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:40,820
{\an1}I thought I'd imagined it.

37
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:44,521
{\an1}I didn't realize it.

38
00:05:55,796 --> 00:05:57,330
{\an1}It seems that what you told
me is the truth after all.

39
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,203
{\an1}-So what about Itachi's eyes?

40
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:06,570
{\an1}You going to transplant them?

41
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,471
-No, I won't.

42
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:11,874
{\an1}What Itachi wanted to
see, and what

43
00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:16,777
{\an1}I will see from here on out,
will be completely different.

44
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:20,214
I can't do what
Itachi wished me to.

45
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,915
{\an1}I will restore the Uchiha
clan in my own way.

46
00:06:28,886 --> 00:06:33,622
{\an1}- So, um, I needed to
talk to you, Kisame.

47
00:06:33,622 --> 00:06:35,224
- First,
it was Zetsu and now you're

48
00:06:35,224 --> 00:06:37,525
{\an1}coming around bothering me?

49
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:41,127
{\an1}I actually thought
you were dead, Tobi.

50
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:44,897
{\an1}- It turns out that you
will be the last to know.

51
00:06:44,897 --> 00:06:46,898
{\an1}I'm sorry that I had to deceive
you, the person closest to me.

52
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:58,939
{\an1}-So that's how it is.

53
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:01,075
I had no idea.

54
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:05,477
{\an1}I never would have guess you
were Tobi, but I'm relieved.

55
00:07:05,477 --> 00:07:07,712
{\an1}If you're the one
pulling the strings,

56
00:07:07,712 --> 00:07:11,015
{\an1}that makes it easier for
me former Lord Mizukage.

57
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:14,251
I mean, Madara.

58
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:17,186
{\an1}TOBI: I shall continue
to count on you, Kisame.

59
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:17,987
{\an1}-The same goes for me.

60
00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:36,531
{\an1}So Itachi is out, and now
this little brother joins up.

61
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:39,935
{\an1}What an interesting
turn of events.

62
00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:44,671
- We, the Taka,
will destroy the Leaf.

63
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:46,405
{\an1}-Easier said than done.

64
00:07:46,405 --> 00:07:47,606
So how?

65
00:07:47,606 --> 00:07:49,874
{\an1}What's your plan?

66
00:07:49,874 --> 00:07:52,576
{\an1}- We are going to
kill the elders,

67
00:07:52,576 --> 00:07:55,645
{\an1}the others are of
no concern to me.

68
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:58,781
{\an1}- If you aim high the ones
below will shield them.

69
00:07:58,781 --> 00:08:01,515
{\an1}It's not going to be easy
as you seem to think.

70
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,651
{\an1}And you four Taka
don't have the strength

71
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:06,120
{\an1}to handle this kind of
thing by yourselves.

72
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,988
{\an1}-Ah, listen, Kisame.

73
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,723
{\an1}You really shouldn't make the
mistake of underestimating us.

74
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:13,457
{\an1}We still haven't settled
that little game of ours

75
00:08:13,457 --> 00:08:13,925
{\an1}we started the other day.

76
00:08:18,427 --> 00:08:20,229
{\an1}So let me show you my real...

77
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:20,963
{\an1}-Stop it, Suigetsu.

78
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:20,896
Enough.

79
00:08:33,071 --> 00:08:36,874
{\an1}- Sasuke, you haven't
trained them very well.

80
00:08:36,874 --> 00:08:37,640
{\an1}SUIGETSU (VOICEOVER): He
stopped me with just his arm.

81
00:08:41,311 --> 00:08:42,844
{\an1}-Suigetsu, are you that stupid?

82
00:08:42,844 --> 00:08:45,546
{\an1}This isn't the time or place.

83
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:47,747
{\an1}- My objective is that
sword of his, Samehada.

84
00:08:47,747 --> 00:08:49,783
{\an1}I've been traveling
with Sasuke only

85
00:08:49,783 --> 00:08:52,751
so I can get my
hands on that thing.

86
00:08:52,751 --> 00:08:54,386
{\an1}-All right, Sasuke.

87
00:08:54,386 --> 00:08:55,486
What now?

88
00:08:55,486 --> 00:08:57,754
-Fine by me.

89
00:08:57,754 --> 00:09:00,123
{\an1}Do whatever you feel
you have to, Suigetsu.

90
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:05,327
But know this,
you cannot win against him yet.

91
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:07,095
{\an1}KISAME (VOICEOVER): Yet, huh?

92
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:10,297
{\an1}- Gee, thanks a lot for the
vote of confidence, Sasuke.

93
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:11,864
{\an1}Have a little faith.

94
00:09:11,864 --> 00:09:12,765
{\an1}I'll treat you to some
tasty shark's fin.

95
00:09:22,838 --> 00:09:25,074
{\an1}- The Akatsuki is low
on manpower right now.

96
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:29,444
We should avoid
unnecessary skirmishes.

97
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,179
{\an1}- The pot shouldn't be calling
the kettle black, you know.

98
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:36,182
{\an1}- We share common
interests so from here on,

99
00:09:36,182 --> 00:09:38,649
{\an1}Taka will little work
together with the Akatsuki.

100
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:40,318
{\an1}-Oh, is that right?

101
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:42,585
{\an1}And just what's in it for us?

102
00:09:42,585 --> 00:09:44,687
-A tailed beast.

103
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:46,456
-Tailed beast?

104
00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:48,223
{\an1}-You don't know about them?

105
00:09:48,223 --> 00:09:49,424
{\an1}-Of course we do.

106
00:09:49,424 --> 00:09:51,359
They're enormous
amounts of chakra

107
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,493
{\an1}that physically manifest as
beasts, like the Nine Tails,

108
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,727
{\an1}and they're held within hosts...

109
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,196
{\an1}-So what does that mean?

110
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,331
{\an1}-They're chakra monsters.

111
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:01,765
{\an1}Long ago, the first Hokage
collected several of them

112
00:10:01,765 --> 00:10:04,667
{\an1}and kept them under his control.

113
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:07,069
{\an1}Each time a great
ninja war threatened,

114
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:10,939
{\an1}he used them to maintain the
power balance distributing them

115
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:14,108
{\an1}to other lands, starting with
the five great nations as proof

116
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:16,743
of alliances.

117
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:20,278
{\an1}You could call them the
ultimate chakra weapons.

118
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:22,279
{\an1}Not a bad proposition, is it?

119
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,848
{\an1}-How generous of you.

120
00:10:24,848 --> 00:10:31,786
{\an1}- However, if you betray
the Akatsuki, you will die.

121
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:34,888
{\an1}- There are nine of the
tailed beasts in this world.

122
00:10:34,888 --> 00:10:38,190
{\an1}And the Akatsuki has
collected six of them so far.

123
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,759
{\an1}Only three remain.

124
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,559
- Taka and the
Akatsuki will split up

125
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,496
{\an1}to hunt the last three.

126
00:10:44,496 --> 00:10:48,798
{\an1}That is our immediate goal.

127
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:51,466
{\an1}- You don't have the
Nine Tails yet, do you?

128
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:53,768
{\an1}-Taka will captured Eight Tails.

129
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:56,470
{\an1}The Akatsuki will
hunt the other.

130
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,903
{\an1}That means Naruto.

131
00:11:06,344 --> 00:11:08,478
-Well?

132
00:11:08,478 --> 00:11:10,414
{\an1}TOBI: It went perfectly.

133
00:11:10,414 --> 00:11:13,382
{\an1}-That's good to hear.

134
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:17,550
{\an1}- Itachi is dead,
so our eyesore is finally gone.

135
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,886
And now,
we need no longer keep our pack

136
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:21,686
{\an1}to stay away from
the Hidden Leaf.

137
00:11:21,686 --> 00:11:23,889
{\an1}-Such a long wait.

138
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:26,425
{\an1}- But now, we can proceed
according to plan.

139
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:29,959
{\an1}It was worth the wait.

140
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:32,094
{\an1}Itachi had placed insurance
in Sasuke, the Amaterasu.

141
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:46,570
{\an1}- Itachi believed no one
knew the truth about him,

142
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,807
so why would you
go to such lengths?

143
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:51,774
{\an1}- True intentions
aside, he probably

144
00:11:51,774 --> 00:11:54,444
{\an1}feared I would try
to recruit Sasuke,

145
00:11:54,444 --> 00:11:57,812
{\an1}and wanted to guard against
such an eventuality.

146
00:11:57,812 --> 00:12:00,014
{\an1}- But whoever would have
thought that the Akatsuki would

147
00:12:00,014 --> 00:12:03,749
{\an1}have to lose so many members
just to get to this point?

148
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:07,186
{\an1}-We face trouble at every turn.

149
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:08,886
{\an1}But everyone made a
valuable contribution

150
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:11,588
{\an1}in their own way, Deidara.

151
00:12:11,588 --> 00:12:13,090
Sasori.

152
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,391
Hidan.

153
00:12:14,391 --> 00:12:16,925
Kakuzu.

154
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:19,827
{\an1}Without them we wouldn't have
gotten as far as we have.

155
00:12:19,827 --> 00:12:24,964
{\an1}And thanks to them,
everything is following my plan.

156
00:12:24,964 --> 00:12:27,599
{\an1}Most importantly, I claimed
Sasuke and won him over.

157
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:38,140
- So,
where is this Eight Tails guy?

158
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,942
{\an1}- You don't know who
you're messing with.

159
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:45,811
{\an1}We're not going to say anything,
not to the likes of you.

160
00:12:45,811 --> 00:12:48,414
{\an1}We of the Yotsuki clan
are stronger than that.

161
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:50,014
{\an1}We don't betray one of our own.

162
00:12:50,014 --> 00:12:51,849
Never.

163
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:53,350
{\an1}- A fearful heart is
more likely to crack.

164
00:13:03,257 --> 00:13:04,657
{\an1}-Suigetsu, enough.

165
00:13:04,657 --> 00:13:07,759
{\an1}He's under Sasuke's
genjutsu now.

166
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,361
- Aw, I was just
getting to the fun part.

167
00:13:14,398 --> 00:13:17,933
{\an1}- Give me the location
of the Eight Tails.

168
00:13:17,933 --> 00:13:23,505
{\an1}- He's busy training at
Unraikyo, Storm Cloud ravine.

169
00:13:23,505 --> 00:13:26,806
{\an1}-And what does he look like?

170
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,709
{\an1}He's the wielder of many
blades, eight blades.

171
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,478
{\an1}He has steel tattooed on his
right shoulder and bull horns

172
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:34,111
{\an1}on his left cheek.

173
00:13:54,893 --> 00:13:56,027
{\an1}SUIGETSU (VOICEOVER):
That's just great.

174
00:13:56,027 --> 00:13:59,163
{\an1}Those eyes of his have improved.

175
00:13:59,163 --> 00:14:00,631
{\an1}All that's going to do is
make him even more difficult

176
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,998
to deal with.

177
00:14:02,998 --> 00:14:05,367
{\an1}KARIN (VOICEOVER): Oh wow,
Sasuke has gotten even cooler.

178
00:14:09,802 --> 00:14:11,571
{\an1}JUGO (VOICEOVER):
It's nice here.

179
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:14,439
{\an1}I think I'll be able to
keep myself under control.

180
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:15,740
I feel so calm.

181
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:10,645
[footsteps]

182
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:13,447
-Oh, my sight.

183
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:15,615
{\an1}Light, too bright.

184
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:15,815
Noon already?

185
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,652
Damn it, man.

186
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:23,920
{\an1}No fooling, you fool.

187
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,854
{\an1}Training all morning,
my belly's starving.

188
00:15:25,854 --> 00:15:28,157
{\an1}I'm a rap loving guy.

189
00:15:28,157 --> 00:15:30,825
{\an1}I got me a hunch that I just
decided on sukiyaki for lunch.

190
00:15:30,825 --> 00:15:33,494
Yeah.

191
00:15:33,494 --> 00:15:33,827
Hm?

192
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:45,002
{\an1}- Are you the Jinjuriki
host of the Eight Tails?

193
00:15:45,002 --> 00:15:47,370
{\an1}- That's Lord Eight Tails
Sir, to you.

194
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,904
No, wait.

195
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:50,606
You say,
are you Lord Jinjuriki, sir?

196
00:15:50,606 --> 00:15:51,707
Got it?

197
00:15:51,707 --> 00:15:53,541
{\an1}-I'm here to capture you.

198
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:54,741
-Un-huh.

199
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:56,343
{\an1}Now here is what you say.

200
00:15:56,343 --> 00:15:57,776
{\an1}Freeze, let me capture
you, sir, please?

201
00:15:57,776 --> 00:16:00,145
You got it?

202
00:16:00,145 --> 00:16:03,514
{\an1}-Suigetsu, take the right.

203
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:06,750
{\an1}Jugo take the left.

204
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,984
{\an1}Karin, behind me, cover my back.

205
00:16:15,357 --> 00:16:18,858
-Let's see now.

206
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:21,461
{\an1}I'm in the midst of my rhymes,
y'all are busting my time.

207
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:23,328
{\an1}Now, I gotta spit my
line, fools.

208
00:16:23,328 --> 00:16:23,428
You fools.

209
00:16:27,964 --> 00:16:30,133
{\an1}- We're not supposed to kill
the Jinjuriki, you know.

210
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:32,635
{\an1}Remember what the Akatsuki
told us, Suigetsu?

211
00:16:32,635 --> 00:16:34,002
-Don't worry.

212
00:16:34,002 --> 00:16:34,869
{\an1}I feel his chakra
loud and clear.

213
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:39,539
Damn it,
talk about a showy diversion.

214
00:16:46,444 --> 00:16:46,977
-Come on.

215
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,349
{\an1}- Only one who gets to dig
me, is me, yo.

216
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:58,486
{\an1}So stand back and stay back or
you're gonna get whacked, fool.

217
00:16:58,486 --> 00:16:58,818
Yah.

218
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:04,890
{\an1}-Just step back, Suigetsu.

219
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:10,762
{\an1}-I am peeking at you.

220
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:13,730
{\an1}See you're not quite through,
but in all your crew,

221
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,463
{\an1}your brain cells are few.

222
00:17:14,463 --> 00:17:15,997
{\an1}-Stop joking around.

223
00:17:15,997 --> 00:17:18,566
{\an1}Blood lust bravery
makes me go ballistic.

224
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:20,968
{\an1}Knowing you can't stop
me makes me optimistic.

225
00:17:20,968 --> 00:17:24,637
{\an1}My blades goin' round and
next you're going down.

226
00:17:24,637 --> 00:17:26,438
{\an1}Come on and get your fill of
my sweet and awesome skills.

227
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:26,572
Yah.

228
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:50,655
{\an1}My powers are flashin'.

229
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:52,757
{\an1}Still more in my stash.

230
00:17:52,757 --> 00:17:57,760
{\an1}Eight Tails, that be me,
the rappin' Killer B. Yah.

231
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,228
{\an1}This battle, you initiated,
but I'll leave you humiliated.

232
00:18:00,228 --> 00:18:01,362
{\an1}Before you get disintegrated...
ow.

233
00:18:04,565 --> 00:18:06,932
Bit my tongue.

234
00:18:06,932 --> 00:18:08,901
{\an1}-What's up with this guy?

235
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:10,102
He's completely
crazy but he still

236
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:12,303
{\an1}managed to take down Jugo.

237
00:18:12,303 --> 00:18:14,404
{\an1}SUIGETSU (VOICEOVER): First he
blocks my executioner's blade

238
00:18:14,404 --> 00:18:16,573
{\an1}and then he wields
it like he owns it.

239
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:18,307
{\an1}What is this guy?

240
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:22,043
{\an1}- You made me bite my
tongue, fools.

241
00:18:22,043 --> 00:18:23,010
[groaning]

242
00:18:29,915 --> 00:18:30,916
{\an1}KARIN (VOICEOVER):
You all right?

243
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:31,016
-Yeah.

244
00:18:35,753 --> 00:18:36,052
{\an1}-I'll handle this.

245
00:19:01,137 --> 00:19:03,405
{\an1}- Just who in the hell
are all y'all fools.

246
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:04,373
You fools.

247
00:19:04,373 --> 00:19:06,006
{\an1}-Would you shut up all ready.

248
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:06,974
{\an1}You're getting on my nerves.

249
00:19:06,974 --> 00:19:08,875
-Yo, who are ya?

250
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:09,810
{\an1}Why you want to capture me?

251
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,411
{\an1}What's the deal, yo?

252
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:15,146
- I'm under no
obligation to tell you.

253
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:16,948
{\an1}- Why do we have to fight
such a weird rhyming

254
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:18,882
{\an1}guy in the first place anyway?

255
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:20,784
{\an1}This whole thing is a pain.

256
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:24,387
{\an1}- It's to obtain more power
as quickly as possible.

257
00:19:24,387 --> 00:19:25,788
{\an1}If you don't like it, leave.

258
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:28,021
-Pf.

259
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:31,090
{\an1}SUIGETSU (VOICEOVER):
That's your prerogative.

260
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,527
{\an1}- And I also want to confirm
the Akatsuki's promise,

261
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,660
{\an1}whether they're pledge to give
us the tailed beast is true.

262
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:42,565
Regardless,
we are the ones who are

263
00:19:42,565 --> 00:19:45,868
{\an1}going to use the Akatsuki,
not the other way around.

264
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:48,871
So all of you,
keep that in mind.

265
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:50,971
{\an1}KILLER B (VOICEOVER): Akatsuki?

-Yes, of course.

267

{\an1}KARIN (VOICEOVER): Oh,
you are so cool, Sasuke.

268
00:19:54,974 --> 00:20:00,779
{\an1}I knew that he would never
let himself be used as a pawn.

269
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:05,947
{\an1}- OK, let's do this and shut up
this witless pain in the ear.

270
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:07,115
{\an1}-That is the plan.

[theme music]

272
00:21:56,157 --> 00:21:57,792
{\an1}- Your illusions,
I'll obliterate,

273
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:59,594
{\an1}and you, I shall annihilate.

274
00:21:59,594 --> 00:22:03,662
{\an1}My true mode as the tailed beast
abode is that of a monster.

See, I told ya,
transformation, yah.

you pee your pants,

you little ants.
To spare my foes,

278
00:22:09,934 --> 00:22:11,033
{\an1}I was born a glorious longhorn.

Ya.

280
00:22:13,402 --> 00:22:16,571
{\an1}KARIN (VOICEOVER): Such
Chakra, is this even possible?
