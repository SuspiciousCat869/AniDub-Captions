1
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:08,308
NARUTO: A Sand shinobi?

2
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,676
KAKASHI: What does this mean?

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:10,744
-I wish I knew.

4
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,813
Poor fool.

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,082
He went missing after
Gaara was abducted

6
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:18,385
while the village was
still in disarray.

7
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,989
-Is it possible he was
a spy for the Akatsuki.

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,790
CHIYO: No.

9
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:26,693
He served on the
council for four years.

10
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,302
LEE: Was he using a
transformation jutsu?

11
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,104
-No, Lee.

12
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,273
This jutsu is on a
whole other level.

13
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,512
-The Fireball Jutsu.

14
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,015
It was created by
the Uchiha clan.

15
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,150
It's their specialty.

16
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,184
-Fire Style.

17
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,119
Fireball Jutsu.

18
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,459
-That attack was the real thing.

19
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:11,638
-Looks like you're
done too, huh?

20
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:12,406
-Yes.

21
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,441
I was out of chakra.

22
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:18,545
-Well, we did only give the
sacrifices 30% of our chakra,

23
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,947
right?

24
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,183
This jutsu's handy for creating
exact duplicates of ourselves,

25
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,318
it's true.

26
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,053
But with that
little chakra, it's

27
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,623
no big surprise our
stand ins were taken out.

28
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,558
The jutsu they can
use are directly

29
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:35,862
proportionate to how
much you give them.

30
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:38,832
-But it was more than enough
to buy us a little time.

31
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,670
-The jutsu wore off, did it?

32
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:20,440
But we were able to delay them.

33
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,442
That should be enough.

34
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:26,480
Well done, Itachi, Kisame.

35
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,082
-Aren't you forgetting someone?

36
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:32,052
Need I remind you where
the bodies for your jutsu

37
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,654
came from?

38
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:37,591
They were both my subordinates.

39
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:38,959
-Hmph.

40
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,062
You should be the
one thanking me.

41
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,666
It's only because of
my impersonation jutsu

42
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,835
they could join the
ranks of the Akatsuki.

43
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,837
Short lived as it was.

44
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,812
It's almost finished.

45
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,882
[theme music]

46
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,021
TENTEN: This means
the real one's still

47
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,690
holed up somewhere, doesn't it?

48
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,759
-I think it's safe to
assume at this point

49
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,395
that his goal was to gather
information and stall us here

50
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,596
for a while.

51
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,166
-If that is the case, we
have not a moment to lose.

52
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,133
-All right, then.

53
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,135
Let's hurry.

54
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,203
-It's over this way.

55
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,210
-Just as I thought.

56
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,914
They were clearly trying
to stall for time.

57
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,049
KAKASHI: That's an
impressive jutsu they've got.

58
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,692
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

59
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,260
I never realized
you were fighting

60
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,996
against people as
strong as this.

61
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,566
-For them to use a
jutsu like this stall

62
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,068
us can mean only one thing.

63
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,204
It's worse than I thought.

64
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:40,707
The extraction of the tailed
beast has already begun.

65
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,576
-Huh?

66
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,177
-We're out of time.

67
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:47,180
We need to get to
Gaara right away.

68
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:47,781
-So, wait.

69
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,050
Hold on.

70
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,220
What do you mean by extraction?

71
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,388
-They're after the Shukaku.

72
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,157
If they can draw
out the One Tail,

73
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,359
they can create
a new Junchuriki.

74
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,927
-A new Jinchuriki?

75
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,101
-I told you, didn't I?

76
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:12,439
How the tailed beasts possess
power beyond all reckoning,

77
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:17,677
and how every land has tried to
use them as military weapons?

78
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,480
The Junchuriki is the
name given to those

79
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,483
who control that power.

80
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,385
-But earlier you said--

81
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,488
-The beasts are huge
concentrations of chakra,

82
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,757
and during the Great
War, every nation

83
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,960
competed for control and
them for military purposes.

84
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:37,130
They fought
relentlessly over them,

85
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:41,101
but the tailed beasts' powers
were beyond human imagining.

86
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,203
No one could control them.

87
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,242
Not for lack of trying.

88
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,177
There were, of course,
those who tried

89
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:55,415
to harness that great power
for their own purposes,

90
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,451
attempting to control the
beasts by sealing them

91
00:06:58,485 --> 00:06:59,386
away inside of people.

92
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:05,292
By doing so, they hoped to
suppress the tail beasts'

93
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:08,862
great power, and then bend
that might to their will.

94
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,470
And the ones with
the tailed beasts

95
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:21,975
sealed inside of them, such
as our own village's Gaara,

96
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,443
are known as Junchuriki.

97
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:32,252
Junchuriki wield
unimaginable power,

98
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,789
thanks to their resonance
with the beasts they carry.

99
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,525
And if you count
Gaara, then all told,

100
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,761
there have been three Junchuriki
in the history of the Sand

101
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,163
village thus far.

102
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,276
It's up to you.

103
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:10,924
-There were several wars
fought using the Jinchuriki,

104
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,359
weren't there?

105
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:13,727
-That's correct.

106
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:25,605
-Then the people who become
Jinchuriki-- All right, then.

107
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:29,709
How are the tailed
beasts extracted?

108
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,811
-A couple of things are needed.

109
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,482
A sealing jutsu strong
enough to counterbalance

110
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:40,420
the tailed beast's
power, and a lot of time.

111
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,056
But were things to reach that
point, then the Jinchuriki--

112
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,194
-You don't mean--

113
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,033
-That's right, dear.

114
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:58,605
Once the tailed beast
is extracted, they die.

115
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,622
The others I mentioned,
the Jinchuriki who

116
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:21,327
came before Gaara, we extracted
the Shukaku from them as well,

117
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,296
and both died as a result.

118
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:35,075
-You always were quick to cry.

119
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,077
Huh, Sakura?

120
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,579
Hey don't worry.

121
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,181
I promise I'm gonna save Gaara.

122
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,019
-Don't you get it?

123
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,187
Naruto, I'm concerned.

124
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,321
-We better hurry.

125
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,700
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

126
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:11,544
-Huh?

127
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,487
It's from Sis.

128
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,137
-You shouldn't be moving yet.

129
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,705
You're still recovering.

130
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,306
-I'm fine, OK?

131
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,243
Well enough to be
walking around at least.

132
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:44,577
Forget about me, though.

133
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,380
We've finally gotten
word from Lady Chiyo.

134
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,882
I can't just sit here.

135
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,049
-I see then.

136
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,253
You've heard about
that already, have you?

137
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,988
The news isn't good.

138
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,556
We've learned of
something terrible.

139
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,929
-Yura was a spy?

140
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,697
Incredible.

141
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,799
Four years, he sat
on the council.

142
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,734
How can it be?

143
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,169
-Yes, I know.

144
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,571
But it finally makes sense now.

145
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,073
That's how they were able to
break through our defenses

146
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,975
so easily.

147
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,579
And who'd have ever suspected
the head of our security

148
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,682
was partnered with the enemy?

149
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,084
-I don't understand
how this even happened.

150
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:28,788
We checked out everyone
when Gaara became Kazekage.

151
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,957
-We don't know the truth yet.

152
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,393
It's possible this fellow
was under the control

153
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,261
of some form of jutsu.

154
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,163
-More importantly,
why are there are

155
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,500
no details about the Kazekage?

156
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,369
She says nothing of
when Gaara will return.

157
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,738
The leader of one of
the five great nations

158
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,140
has been kidnapped.

159
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,342
By a lone pair of
outlaws, no less!

160
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:55,448
And if that's not bad enough,
it seems one of these vermin

161
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,483
is Sasori of the Red Sand.

162
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:01,888
We cannot allow a disgrace
of this magnitude to get out.

163
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,990
-If it were known the
Kazekage is missing,

164
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,758
there's no telling
how emboldened

165
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,328
the neighboring
lands would become.

166
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,531
Our most pressing need is
to elect a new Kazekage

167
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,968
and bring much needed
stability to the village.

168
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,102
-Nonsense.

169
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,937
We don't know that Gaara
isn't coming back yet.

170
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,576
-There are those of the
opinion that the village might

171
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,980
be better off if he
never came back at all.

172
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,182
-What are you getting at?

173
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,652
-Gaara is an unstable
monster carrying the One Tail

174
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,654
inside of him.

175
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,889
We thought he would
be easier to govern

176
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,992
if we made him the Kazekage.

177
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,628
There's no telling when
he'll go out of control.

178
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:45,398
He's a danger to us all.

179
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:49,135
I know Gaara resonated with
the Shukaku in the beginning,

180
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,470
but face it.

181
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,740
He's a botched
experiment at best.

182
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,376
Even his own father knew that.

183
00:12:56,409 --> 00:13:00,647
The Fourth Kazekage ordered
his assassination for a reason.

184
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,349
I know there's many in
the younger generation who

185
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:07,754
look on him favorably, almost
blinded by their admiration.

186
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,423
But let's not bother
with pretenses.

187
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,525
Most of the village
looks on him in fear.

188
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:16,429
No one really believes in him.

189
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,931
-I don't care if you
are a council member.

190
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,168
I am not gonna listen to this!

191
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,137
-Let go of him, Kankuro.

192
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,973
You stand before the
statues of the Kazekage.

193
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,842
This is a sacred place.

194
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:32,312
-Listen to me, Kankuro.

195
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,881
Your anger is certainly
understandable,

196
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,917
but there's an element
of truth to what he says.

197
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,953
We have to face the
facts here, and this

198
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,989
isn't an issue of
how trustworthy we

199
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,324
believe Gaara to be.

200
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,764
-We have faced a similar
situation before.

201
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:55,635
The Third Kazekage
was also kidnapped.

202
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,471
There was much speculation
on his whereabouts.

203
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,407
The instability led to war.

204
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,377
Countries were devastated.

205
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,281
If we had focused on stability
at home rather than our search,

206
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,217
we would not have
come to such disaster

207
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,618
-So how come that didn't happen?

208
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,960
-The Third was like no other.

209
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:24,731
He was far stronger than
either of his predecessors.

210
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:27,567
And quite astonishingly,
his body was never found.

211
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:36,008
No one could even believe
it, that somebody as powerful

212
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,711
as the Third could
be killed so easily.

213
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,553
Something like that
must never happen again!

214
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:50,523
-We have to consider the best
interests of the village!

215
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:55,828
-That's why the borders
are being secured.

216
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:57,964
-When the Third
Kazekage went missing,

217
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,266
this village fell
into utter chaos.

218
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,268
Our enemies leaped
on the opportunity

219
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,704
and ripped through our
offenses like it was nothing.

220
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,073
Those borders are
our top priority!

221
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,809
-But there was no reason
to send Temari out there!

222
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,711
-Kankuro.

223
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,845
-What are you saying?

224
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,348
We originally had you
slated for that mission

225
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,718
along with your sister, but
you had to get poisoned,

226
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,287
didn't you?

227
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,957
-By assigning you and Temari to
the additional border patrols

228
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:28,294
here at home, we prevent the
younger folk of the village

229
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,897
from getting caught up in
some delusional attempt

230
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,332
to save Gaara.

231
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,802
-We sent Temari to a weak point.

232
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:39,572
An area that's been infiltrated
several times in the past.

233
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,375
Naturally, we wanted
a Jonin rank or higher

234
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,176
for such a mission.

235
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,949
-Look, I get it.

236
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:56,522
It's just that-- just
that, this is Gaara.

237
00:15:56,556 --> 00:16:00,259
He's-- He's my little brother.

238
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:36,128
-Zetsu, Get rid of those two
we used for the impersonation

239
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,797
jutsu.

240
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,599
Understod.

241
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:43,870
-Itachi, What of our enemy's
number and abilities?

242
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:46,572
-It's a four man squad
from the Leaf, comprised

243
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:50,443
of Kakashi Hatake, Sakura
Haruno, the Nine Tails

244
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:56,249
Jinchuriki, Naruto Uzumaki, and
Chiyo, an elder of the Sand.

245
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:56,816
-Granny Chiyo.

246
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,231
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Looks
like he hasn't entirely

247
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:13,866
gotten a handle on
that giant Rasengan.

248
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,917
PAKKUN (VOICEOVER): Hm.

249
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,354
Opening up the Gate of Joy
really took its toll on him.

250
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,223
-Are you feeling OK, Guy-sensei?

251
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,324
-Huh?

252
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,525
Are you kidding?

253
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,928
My battery never runs down, Lee.

254
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,368
-Guy-sensei!

255
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:53,806
-I don't know.

256
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,541
He doesn't look so hot to me.

257
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,076
-What do you expect?

258
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,745
He just used the Asa
Kujaku, didn't he?

259
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,480
We need to let him
rest for a while.

260
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:11,357
-There it is.

261
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,334
-Am I missing something?

262
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:24,170
What did they want us
to guard this place for?

263
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,639
-I don't know, but
orders are orders.

264
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:30,376
We'll keep watch in 24
hour shifts, starting now.

265
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,245
-Yes ma'am.

266
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,314
-Stop here.

267
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,349
-Why?

268
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:37,650
What is it, Kakashi-sensei?

269
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:38,584
What's wrong?

270
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,320
-We're taking a short break.

271
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:45,057
-That's a very wise decision.

272
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,192
-What do you mean?

273
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,593
Come on.

274
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,495
You were the one who was saying
we couldn't waste anymore time.

275
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,365
If we just lay around here doing
nothing, Gaara is gonna be--

276
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:53,366
-Naruto.

277
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,434
Our pace has slowed
since we faced off

278
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,537
against that bogus Itachi.

279
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,307
-He's absolutely right, Naruto.

280
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,676
-If we take the
time to rest up now,

281
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,811
we'll ultimately reach
our destination faster.

282
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:11,083
Keep in mind,
tomorrow we may end up

283
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:14,954
facing the guys who
kidnapped Gaara.

284
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,355
We'll need our full strength.

285
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:19,692
-Yeah, all right.

286
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:20,693
I understand.

287
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,206
-So, this one was Kisame's.

288
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,042
Definitely worth disposing of.

289
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,611
-Well, let's get to
it then, shall we?

piping hot, so be careful.

00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,923
-What'd, you forget yours?

323
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:11,891
-Heh heh.

324
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,325
Duty calls, huh?

325
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,793
I'll just bring it over--

326
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:15,761
TEMARI: No peeping!

327
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,233
Aw.

328
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:25,204
There's nothing like a
good, hot spring, huh?

329
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,505
-You said it.

330
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:29,308
I wouldn't mind a
sand bath back home.

331
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:30,242
-A sand bath?

332
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,448
-Sand coffin.

333
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:40,019
-Uh, yeah not so much.
