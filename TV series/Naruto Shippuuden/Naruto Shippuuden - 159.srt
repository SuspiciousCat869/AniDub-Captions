1
00:00:40,757 --> 00:00:42,090
{\an1}-Earth Style, Mud Wall.

2
00:00:52,022 --> 00:00:52,789
Lightning Blade!

3
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:04,321
What was that?

4
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,755
{\an1}-The copy ninja Kakashi Hatake.

5
00:01:06,788 --> 00:01:08,555
{\an1}I am honored to meet you.

6
00:01:12,988 --> 00:01:14,654
{\an1}Where is the Nine Tails?

7
00:01:14,687 --> 00:01:16,153
{\an1}-That's a stupid question.

8
00:01:31,552 --> 00:01:36,952
[theme music]

9
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:19,976
-Huh?

10
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:21,141
-Over there.

11
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:23,575
Look.

12
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:26,574
-Pa!

13
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:27,975
{\an1}I'm coming with you.

14
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,941
-Mm.

15
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:30,441
Let's go!

16
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,607
{\an1}KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
What was that jutsu?

17
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,305
{\an1}It felt different
from a blast wave.

18
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:49,305
{\an1}But there's definitely
a blast area, with him

19
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:50,005
{\an1}at the epicenter.

20
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:56,838
All right, then.

21
00:03:56,872 --> 00:03:57,938
{\an1}How will you counter this?

22
00:04:07,604 --> 00:04:11,770
{\an1}So he can repel both physical
attacks and ninjutsu?

23
00:04:11,804 --> 00:04:13,670
Impressive.

24
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:14,637
OK.

25
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,903
{\an1}How should I-- another one?

26
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:38,067
You're mine.

27
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,434
{\an1}He-- he wasn't even facing me.

28
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,000
I see.

29
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,800
{\an1}-All of their eyes
are linked together,

30
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,366
{\an1}so their field of vision
is connected and shared.

31
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,500
{\an1}If you should ever
face Pain, you

32
00:04:56,533 --> 00:05:00,499
{\an1}must make absolutely certain
you only face them one on one.

33
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:03,998
{\an1}Remember, keep in mind
that each of the Pains

34
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:06,765
only possesses a
single type of jutsu.

35
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:10,231
{\an1}You must deduce the ability
that each one of them can yield.

36
00:05:19,698 --> 00:05:21,163
{\an1}KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
I can't believe

37
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,663
{\an1}Master Jiraiya took on
six of them at once.

38
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:24,663
That's crazy.

39
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:53,594
That's it.

40
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:54,794
{\an1}That's his ability.

41
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:03,960
Pain.

42
00:06:03,992 --> 00:06:06,593
{\an1}I've got no chance if
I fight them alone.

43
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:07,926
I need back up.

44
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,159
{\an1}And to let the others know
what this one's ability is.

45
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:13,758
{\an1}I have to hold them
off as long as I can.

46
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:23,891
Dammit.

47
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,223
{\an1}PAIN (VOICEOVER): A
lighting style shadow clone.

48
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:51,222
{\an1}-One down, one to go.

49
00:06:51,255 --> 00:06:52,622
{\an1}Am I right, Kakashi?

50
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:58,855
{\an1}-Well, I did have
something in mind.

51
00:06:58,888 --> 00:07:01,987
{\an1}But this will help me
preserve some chakra.

52
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,754
Thank you.

53
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:04,386
-Are you OK?

54
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:04,954
-Yeah.

55
00:07:04,986 --> 00:07:06,854
{\an1}For the most part.

56
00:07:06,887 --> 00:07:08,453
{\an1}PAIN (VOICEOVER): A
trap shadow clone.

57
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,853
{\an1}CHOZA (VOICEOVER): Only using
substitution jutsu and shadow

58
00:07:18,886 --> 00:07:20,886
clones until he
determines the nature

59
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:23,352
{\an1}and the abilities of his enemy.

60
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:27,117
{\an1}He hasn't changed at all since
the last time we teamed up.

61
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:29,218
{\an1}Skilled as always.

62
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:30,618
Which means--

63
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,685
{\an1}-Do you still have
enough chakra?

64
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:36,484
{\an1}-Well, I already had to use my
lightning style shadow clone

65
00:07:36,517 --> 00:07:38,951
{\an1}and exhausted over
half my chakra.

66
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:42,350
{\an1}Honestly, a prolonged battle
against such an adept opponent

67
00:07:42,383 --> 00:07:43,851
will be tight.

68
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:46,382
{\an1}However, I've figured out a
little about his abilities.

69
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,549
{\an1}-He's comin' at us, Pa.

70
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:19,646
-Almighty Push.

71
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,346
-There!

72
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:33,712
-OK.

73
00:08:50,577 --> 00:08:52,410
{\an1}-What just happened back there?

74
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:55,243
{\an1}-He repelled all of our attacks.

75
00:08:55,276 --> 00:08:57,543
{\an1}Using himself as the
epicenter, his jutsu

76
00:08:57,577 --> 00:09:00,742
{\an1}allows him to pull in
or push objects away,

77
00:09:00,776 --> 00:09:04,108
{\an1}similar to the magnetic laws
of attraction and repulsion.

78
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:07,809
{\an1}But it seems he can't use
that jutsu continuously.

79
00:09:07,843 --> 00:09:10,107
{\an1}I know for certain there's
an interval of time

80
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:12,141
{\an1}before he can activate
the next jutsu.

81
00:09:21,373 --> 00:09:23,674
{\an1}-Everyone else has
been taken down.

82
00:09:23,707 --> 00:09:25,973
{\an1}If he can repel all
our attacks, how

83
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:27,607
{\an1}are we supposed to defeat him?

84
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,840
{\an1}-And the interval between
jutsus seems quite short,

85
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:32,506
{\an1}so we can't get close.

86
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,840
-Perhaps.

87
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,639
{\an1}But it's our only chance.

88
00:09:36,673 --> 00:09:40,438
{\an1}I have an idea, and
I need your help.

89
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:07,536
{\an1}-Nice movements, and
a wide range of jutsu.

90
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,269
{\an1}I need to kill you, so you won't
become a nuisance to me later.

91
00:10:15,602 --> 00:10:16,469
-Now.

92
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:17,335
-Double--

93
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:18,335
-Human--

94
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:18,836
-Boulder!

95
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:23,234
-Too slow.

96
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,233
{\an1}PAIN (VOICEOVER):
Kakashi Hatake.

97
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:38,200
{\an1}He hid this chain underground
before his attack.

98
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,900
{\an1}-Lightning Blade!

99
00:10:45,365 --> 00:10:47,432
{\an1}-Go, Kakashi-sensei!

100
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:48,365
{\an1}-Finish him, Kakashi!

101
00:10:58,665 --> 00:10:59,698
The other Pain?

102
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:00,898
{\an1}He could still move?

103
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,697
{\an1}-Make it in time!

104
00:11:25,495 --> 00:11:27,695
{\an1}-It appears you're
not pretending.

105
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,961
{\an1}You really can't move.

106
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:33,528
{\an1}KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
I was too late.

107
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,928
{\an1}-I know you're not
a shadow clone.

108
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,993
{\an1}This time I'll make
certain you die.

109
00:11:45,027 --> 00:11:47,092
It's over.

110
00:11:47,126 --> 00:11:51,026
{\an1}But just to be absolutely
safe, I'll keep my distance.

111
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:00,292
Hmph.

112
00:12:00,325 --> 00:12:01,225
You'll now pain.

113
00:12:26,457 --> 00:12:28,422
{\an1}TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): I
can't believe the damage.

114
00:12:38,855 --> 00:12:40,354
-This is bad.

115
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:42,254
{\an1}Everyone, we must hurry.

116
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:42,755
-Right.

117
00:12:42,788 --> 00:12:43,254
Agreed.

118
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:43,755
Hurry.

119
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:44,221
-Let's go.

120
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:44,788
No, hurry.

121
00:12:44,822 --> 00:12:45,288
-Help them.

122
00:12:45,321 --> 00:12:45,721
-We must.

123
00:13:15,452 --> 00:13:17,485
CHOJI: Pa!

124
00:13:17,518 --> 00:13:18,151
Kakashi-sensei!

125
00:13:20,983 --> 00:13:21,884
{\an1}-Get them inside.

126
00:13:21,918 --> 00:13:22,983
-Lie still.

127
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:23,983
{\an1}Let the sedative--

128
00:13:24,017 --> 00:13:25,451
{\an1}-That woman needs help now.

129
00:13:32,349 --> 00:13:34,049
-All right, I've
finished treating him.

130
00:13:34,082 --> 00:13:36,249
{\an1}You can splint his arm now.

131
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:37,450
-Yes, ma'am.

132
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,750
-Sakura!

133
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:40,515
I've got another
wounded man here.

134
00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:41,348
Quick.

135
00:13:41,382 --> 00:13:42,615
-I'll handle it.

136
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:44,115
{\an1}Please just lay him
down over there.

137
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:49,415
[crying]

138
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:49,916
-Pa.

139
00:13:54,314 --> 00:13:57,181
{\an1}You tried to save me.

140
00:13:57,214 --> 00:14:00,747
{\an1}KAKASHI: Cry later, Choji.

141
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,480
{\an1}If you can still move, you
must report Pain's abilities

142
00:14:04,513 --> 00:14:09,380
{\an1}to Lady Tsunade, and have
her set up counter measures.

143
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:12,312
{\an1}-But Kakashi-sensei, you--

144
00:14:12,345 --> 00:14:14,012
-Mourn later.

145
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:15,846
You must hurry.

146
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,245
Run!

147
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,712
{\an1}-But I-- I can't-- I just--

148
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:23,445
{\an1}-Don't let Choza's
sacrifice be in vain.

149
00:14:26,977 --> 00:14:28,378
{\an1}-You sure are stubborn.

150
00:14:28,411 --> 00:14:29,445
{\an1}KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Damn.

151
00:14:29,478 --> 00:14:40,844
{\an1}He's still-- He's
aiming for Choji.

152
00:14:40,877 --> 00:14:41,277
-Pa!

153
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:41,844
Quick!

154
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:49,910
Pa.

155
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:52,543
Thank you for
everything you've done.

156
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:56,208
Just you watch.

157
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:57,074
-Run, Choji!

158
00:15:05,574 --> 00:15:07,574
{\an1}KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): With
the chakra I have left,

159
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,474
{\an1}it's impossible to
destroy his entire body.

160
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:13,640
{\an1}And if I use that
jutsu one more time,

161
00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:16,373
{\an1}I'll exhaust all my
stamina and chakra.

162
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:31,238
{\an1}Without a doubt, I'll-- This
information must get to those

163
00:15:31,272 --> 00:15:33,372
who still live.

164
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:36,204
{\an1}Right now, this is the only
way to save the Hidden Leaf

165
00:15:36,237 --> 00:15:36,704
Village.

166
00:15:52,503 --> 00:15:53,370
-Of course.

167
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:12,868
{\an1}He must have used
that ocular jutsu

168
00:16:12,902 --> 00:16:14,568
{\an1}to divert that attack, too.

169
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:32,232
{\an1}KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Well, it
seems that this is it for me,

170
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:36,964
too, Obito, Rin.

171
00:16:48,431 --> 00:16:51,898
{\an1}-Whatever the village,
or anyone says,

172
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:55,930
{\an1}I think you're a great Jonin.

173
00:16:55,963 --> 00:16:58,196
{\an1}I'm about to die.

174
00:16:58,229 --> 00:17:04,696
{\an1}I'll become your eye, and
I'll see the future for you.

175
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,429
{\an1}Take care of Rin, Kakashi.

176
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:09,928
-Obito.

177
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:18,994
{\an1}This as far as it goes.

178
00:17:19,027 --> 00:17:20,394
{\an1}Me being your eyes.

179
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:29,126
{\an1}I couldn't even protect Rin.

180
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,226
{\an1}I broke my promise to you.

181
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:40,893
{\an1}Please, forgive me,
Obito, Rin, Sensei.

182
00:17:56,591 --> 00:18:00,223
I-- I guess I'll
be joining you now.

183
00:18:08,257 --> 00:18:11,856
{\an1}-Is that you, Kakashi?

184
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,322
{\an1}-So this is where you were.

185
00:18:18,256 --> 00:18:22,221
{\an1}-Now that we're both here,
will you tell me your tale?

186
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:23,422
-Yeah.

187
00:18:23,455 --> 00:18:28,522
{\an1}But it's a long story, So
I want to take my time.

188
00:18:28,555 --> 00:18:29,288
-Yeah.

189
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:30,088
That's fine.

190
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:36,788
{\an1}-Where to begin, Father?

191
00:18:36,821 --> 00:18:38,354
-Ah!

192
00:18:38,387 --> 00:18:39,287
{\an1}-What is it, milady?

193
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,086
-Lady Tsunade--

194
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:04,917
{\an1}-Lady Katsuyu has made contact
with everyone in the village.

195
00:19:18,717 --> 00:19:20,483
My apologies.

196
00:19:20,517 --> 00:19:21,617
Let us continue.

197
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:22,450
{\an1}CHOJI: Lady Tsunade!

198
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:30,215
{\an1}We've figured out one
of the enemy's profiles.

199
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:31,182
-Yes?

200
00:19:31,215 --> 00:19:32,649
Go on.

201
00:19:32,682 --> 00:19:33,783
-He's male.

202
00:19:33,815 --> 00:19:37,014
{\an1}Appears to be between
25 and 30 years of age.

203
00:19:37,047 --> 00:19:39,381
{\an1}Distinguishing features
are six nose piercings

204
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:41,281
{\an1}and seven studs in each ear.

205
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:46,213
{\an1}His ability is a jutsu
that simulates magnetism.

206
00:19:46,247 --> 00:19:49,147
{\an1}He can attract targeted
objects to himself,

207
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:53,013
{\an1}but he can also repel
all ninjutsu attacks.

208
00:19:53,046 --> 00:19:55,846
{\an1}-He can repel all of them?

209
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,979
-Yes.

210
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:59,546
{\an1}However, after he uses
either of those jutsu,

211
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:01,312
{\an1}there's a five second
interval in which

212
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:03,746
{\an1}he can't utilize another jutsu.

213
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,178
-Five seconds?

214
00:20:05,211 --> 00:20:07,545
That's all?

215
00:20:07,578 --> 00:20:09,311
{\an1}-Nice work reporting this.

216
00:20:09,345 --> 00:20:11,779
{\an1}We'll suffer fewer casualties.

217
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:15,477
{\an1}Now, Lady Katsuyu will pass
the intel on to everyone.

218
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:16,444
MEN: Right!

219
00:20:16,477 --> 00:20:19,943
{\an1}-Team Choza assisted
Kakashi-sense

220
00:20:19,977 --> 00:20:22,144
{\an1}against two of the enemy.

221
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:25,110
{\an1}I believe I was the only one
who didn't perish in the battle.

222
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:36,042
{\an1}-You must go back to Choza, and
get him to the hospital now.

223
00:20:36,076 --> 00:20:37,409
{\an1}he can still be saved.

224
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:42,575
{\an1}-Pa's still alive?

225
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:43,075
-Yes.

226
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:52,841
{\an1}-Oh, thank you, thank you!

227
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,640
Kakashi.

228
00:20:59,673 --> 00:21:00,440
{\an1}Is Kakashi-sensei--

229
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:04,906
{\an1}-Just hurry, Choji.

230
00:21:25,238 --> 00:21:29,036

231
00:22:56,028 --> 00:22:57,562
{\an1}SHIZUNE: Each Pain
is only supposed

232
00:22:57,596 --> 00:22:59,863
{\an1}to be able to use one jutsu.

233
00:22:59,895 --> 00:23:01,562
{\an1}What does this mean?

234
00:23:01,596 --> 00:23:05,361
{\an1}Lord Jiraiya defeated the Pain
who can use summoning jutsu.

235
00:23:05,395 --> 00:23:07,994
{\an1}INOICHI: I saw her inside the
memories of that Hidden Rain

236
00:23:08,027 --> 00:23:09,194
ninja.

237
00:23:09,228 --> 00:23:11,328
{\an1}But how could this be?

238
00:23:11,361 --> 00:23:13,127
She was dead.

239
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,093
{\an1}SHIZUNE: Inoichi, please
give me more details.

240
00:23:16,127 --> 00:23:19,394
We might be able
to figure this out.

241
00:23:19,427 --> 00:23:24,092
{\an1}NARUTO: Next time on Naruto
Shippuden, Mystery of Pain.
