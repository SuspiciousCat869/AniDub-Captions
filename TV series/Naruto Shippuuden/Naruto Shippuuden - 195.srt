1
00:00:11,818 --> 00:00:13,287
Ino, Choji.

2
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:15,390
Let's get this over
with and go home.

3
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,468
{\an1}Yeah, we got it!
Innat right, Choji?

4
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:26,002
Huh?

5
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:27,538
{\an1}Choji?!

6
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:30,841
Aaahhh!

7
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:32,745
Ugh, that idiot!

8
00:00:32,778 --> 00:00:33,679
{\an1}<i>[Shikamaru]</i>
<i>Damn it.</i>

9
00:00:33,713 --> 00:00:34,846
Ino, use Formation--

10
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:36,515
{\an1}<i>I know! I know!</i>

11
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:41,054
{\an1}All right!
Shadow Strangle Jutsu!

12
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:49,698
{\an7}<i>[Shikamaru]</i>
<i>I'm counting on you, Ino.</i>

13
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:53,102
{\an7}<i>That was all the chakra I had.</i>
<i>I'm at my limit.</i>

14
00:00:53,902 --> 00:00:56,741
{\an1}Here I go! Mind Transfer Jutsu!

15
00:01:00,344 --> 00:01:01,545
Ahh.

16
00:01:02,046 --> 00:01:04,216
{\an1}Good... Looks like it worked.

17
00:01:05,384 --> 00:01:08,086
{\an1}Ah ha! I thought so!

18
00:01:08,954 --> 00:01:10,590
{\an1}Super Expansion Jutsu!

19
00:01:15,162 --> 00:01:16,163
Huh?

20
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:18,666
{\an1}What's the deal, Choji?!

21
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,004
{\an1}Why were you hanging back?!
This hunt was your idea in
the first place, you know!

22
00:01:23,037 --> 00:01:25,541
{\an1}Listen, everybody needs
food to survive, right?

23
00:01:25,574 --> 00:01:28,745
{\an1}The village is crisis right now;
we have to make sure we eat!

24
00:01:28,779 --> 00:01:31,314
{\an1}Yeah, but you're the only
one who's taking a break!

25
00:01:31,348 --> 00:01:33,985
{\an1}What if the herd got away
while you were slacking off?

26
00:01:34,252 --> 00:01:34,820
{\an3}Well,

27
00:01:36,087 --> 00:01:39,091
{\an1}I wasn't worried.
I already knew just
what Shikamaru would do.

28
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:40,426
Augh.

29
00:01:41,828 --> 00:01:44,964
{\an7}<i>Come to think of it Ino</i>
<i>knew what to do before I</i>
<i>said anything, too...</i>

30
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,301
Heh.

31
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:32,295
{\an1}"Team 10's Teamwork"

32
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:44,609
{\an1}<i>They're demons! They show up</i>
<i>every year during the harvest</i>
<i>and take whatever they want!</i>

33
00:03:44,643 --> 00:03:49,114
{\an1}This year, we were preparing to
fight them off, or die trying!

34
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:52,485
{\an1}But That Baji!
He was too clever for me.

35
00:03:52,752 --> 00:03:55,556
{\an1}I'm not sure if he knew
of my plan or not.

36
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,526
{\an1}<i>But he kidnapped my</i>
<i>granddaughter to</i>
<i>keep us in line!</i>

37
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,629
Who is this Baji?

38
00:04:00,929 --> 00:04:05,167
{\an1}He's the leader of all the
bandits, the ones who've
stolen the crops every year.

39
00:04:05,935 --> 00:04:09,940
{\an1}[sobs]
Please, Please, I beg you,
help us save our village!

40
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:13,678
{\an1}<i>And save my granddaughter</i>
<i>from those outlaws!</i>

41
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,013
And who's this guy?

42
00:04:16,082 --> 00:04:18,483
That's Tofu;
he was once a bandit.

43
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:20,553
[Kakashi]
An ex-bandit?

44
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:22,455
{\an1}I don't blame you
for your mistrust.

45
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:27,028
{\an1}But I- The things that
they did, I just couldn't
be a part of it!

46
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:32,266
{\an5}Tofu here is the one who
told me my granddaughter
had been abducted and
offered to help.

47
00:04:32,868 --> 00:04:36,438
{\an1}He knows where their hideout is.
He'll be an invaluable guide.

48
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,141
I suppose
that's true.

49
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:41,177
{\an1}Please, allow me to help.

50
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:46,684
Well then, let's
get ready to go.

51
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,787
{\an1}<i>[others, in unison]</i>
<i>Right!</i>

52
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:51,024
{\an1}[Asuma]
Shikamaru. You got a minute?

53
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,026
Hm?

54
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,631
{\an1}<i>[Tofu]</i>
<i>The hideout's located</i>
<i>in a natural fort.</i>

55
00:04:57,665 --> 00:05:01,368
{\an1}<i>It's deep inside a cavern</i>
<i>that branches out like an</i>
<i>anthill's passageways.</i>

56
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:06,374
{\an1}<i>There's only one way to get</i>
<i>inside. And they have three</i>
<i>forts guarding that route.</i>

57
00:05:07,143 --> 00:05:10,212
{\an1}But the trickiest
obstacle of all is
Baji's intellect.

58
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:12,416
{\an1}He's very hard to outsmart.

59
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:14,384
<i>That's why people</i>
<i>fear him so much.</i>

60
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:21,026
{\an4}[Kakashi]
The main purpose of
this mission is to
rescue the hostage.

61
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,429
{\an1}That means we'll have to
confront Baji's gang.

62
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:26,733
Shikamaru, what
are your thoughts?

63
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:28,936
{\an1}Hmm, let me see here.

64
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:29,904
Huh?

65
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:33,507
{\an1}He may still be a genin,
but he's a skilled tactician.

66
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:38,447
{\an1}It's unfortunate that there's
only one way in, but we won't be
moving a large force through...

67
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:43,020
{\an1}<i>It's just a few of us,</i>
<i>so maybe we can get past</i>
<i>the forts undetected.</i>

68
00:05:45,254 --> 00:05:49,160
{\an1}However, I'm sure
they've set up numerous
traps to defend it.

69
00:05:49,393 --> 00:05:51,763
{\an1}Since that's the most
obvious plan of attack.

70
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:57,503
{\an4}That route is still our best
chance to escape without
having to fight our way out
after we make the rescue.

71
00:05:58,138 --> 00:06:02,076
{\an1}<i>At the very least,</i>
<i>we need to confirm that</i>
<i>we'd have safe passage.</i>

72
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,177
{\an1}<i>[Asuma]</i>
<i>Okay!</i>

73
00:06:04,912 --> 00:06:08,050
{\an1}So the first thing to do is to
find a way for a small team to
infiltrate the hideout.

74
00:06:08,316 --> 00:06:10,753
{\an1}All right!
Then let's go, already!

75
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:12,454
{\an1}We genin aren't going.

76
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:13,422
Whaa?!

77
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:18,528
{\an1}Like I just explained to you,
the bandits know the routes in,
and are sure to guard them.

78
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:24,136
{\an1}The only ones capable of
getting in undetected are
Kakashi and Asuma Sensei.

79
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,774
{\an1}<i>I believe that it's best</i>
<i>to let them handle this.</i>

80
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,810
{\an1}Of course, that's
just my opinion.

81
00:06:31,078 --> 00:06:32,646
{\an1}And it's a good one!

82
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:34,681
{\an1}Seems like the best way,
Kakashi.

83
00:06:34,948 --> 00:06:37,786
{\an1}Agreed. Don't be so upset,
Naruto.

84
00:06:38,953 --> 00:06:41,289
{\an1}Well, Shikamaru,
take care of
things here.

85
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:42,357
{\an1}Guess I'll have to.

86
00:06:45,862 --> 00:06:47,798
{\an1}What am I gonna do??

87
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:50,234
Well, You heard
what we decided.

88
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:51,903
Just wait here for
a while, okay?

89
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,547
{\an1}Huh? Hey, where'd that
Tofu guy run off to?

90
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:03,449
{\an1}He said Nature called.

91
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:06,921
{\an1}<i>[Tofu]</i>
<i>What's the big idea?!</i>

92
00:07:06,954 --> 00:07:08,256
Huh?!

93
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,958
{\an1}You guys... What was that?

94
00:07:10,457 --> 00:07:11,693
{\an1}<i>[Sasuke]</i>
<i>Hey, look over there!</i>

95
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,695
They have Tofu!

96
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:17,433
{\an1}The bandits captured him?!
But how did they...?!

97
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:18,467
{\an1}Just perfect.

98
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:20,170
{\an1}So what are we
going to do now?!

99
00:07:21,972 --> 00:07:23,640
Come on!
Don't just sit there!

100
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,524
{\an1}The enemy is a gang of
thugs with lots of men.

101
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:42,463
{\an4}They have a hostage
and three forts.
And beyond that,
their citadel.

102
00:07:46,802 --> 00:07:50,273
{\an1}Well, it's gonna be a drag,
but we'll have to go after
them ourselves.

103
00:07:56,981 --> 00:07:58,149
{\an1}<i>Boss Baji!</i>

104
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,518
{\an1}I've brought the deserter!

105
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:02,454
Good. You can go now.

106
00:08:03,256 --> 00:08:06,492
Yes, sir!

107
00:08:06,525 --> 00:08:07,627
Phew!

108
00:08:08,494 --> 00:08:09,796
That hurt.

109
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:12,100
{\an1}Welcome back, my friend.

110
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:16,171
{\an1}Ngh, those men of yours,
train them better. Okay?

111
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,408
{\an1}Remember, I'm a very
valuable informant.

112
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:25,316
{\an4}Sorry. They've been
trained to be suspicious
even if a captive gives
them the correct password.

113
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:28,252
Eagh. Well,
better safe than
sorry, I guess.

114
00:08:29,787 --> 00:08:32,357
{\an1}So, do you have
information for me?

115
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:35,661
Heh heh. The village
hired shinobi just
like you thought.

116
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:38,164
{\an1}Mmm. And how
strong are they?

117
00:08:38,197 --> 00:08:41,201
Eh, it's just two
jonin and six genin.

118
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:43,837
{\an1}Two small teams made
up mostly of genin?

119
00:08:44,438 --> 00:08:47,809
{\an1}Get rid of the jonin, and the
genin will fall. No problem.

120
00:08:48,276 --> 00:08:51,948
{\an1}Yeah, I bet! And the two
jonin aren't even with
the genin right now!

121
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:53,950
Oh? Why's that?

122
00:08:53,983 --> 00:08:57,621
{\an1}<i>They're looking for a way</i>
<i>to get in here without</i>
<i>passing by the forts.</i>

123
00:08:57,988 --> 00:09:00,557
{\an1}<i>[Baji]</i>
<i>Hm, hm. That's</i>
<i>just what I'd do, too.</i>

124
00:09:01,993 --> 00:09:07,666
{\an4}But if they don't anticipate
our traps along the way,
they'll be on nothing more
than a suicide mission.

125
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:10,569
{\an1}Unfortunately, one of them
already thought of that.

126
00:09:10,837 --> 00:09:12,272
Hmm?

127
00:09:12,306 --> 00:09:16,811
{\an1}He's a genin named Shikamaru.
And he already assumed
that there'd be traps.

128
00:09:18,413 --> 00:09:21,383
So a two-man squad
made up of jonin

129
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:25,688
{\an1}bypasses our forts, alert
for traps, while trying to
find a way inside, huh?

130
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,728
{\an1}As if I could be defeated
so easily by such a
predictable strategy!

131
00:09:31,161 --> 00:09:32,496
{\an1}<i>BOOSSS!!!</i>

132
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:33,298
Mmm?

133
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,938
{\an1}Boss! A bunch of shinobi are
here! Somehow they managed to
get past all three of our forts!

134
00:09:39,672 --> 00:09:40,673
{\an1}They did what?!

135
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,615
{\an1}<i>[Baji]</i>
<i>Why didn't the forts warn us?!</i>

136
00:09:49,017 --> 00:09:52,488
{\an1}<i>[Henchman]</i>
<i>The shinobi just showed up out</i>
<i>of nowhere! That's all I know!</i>

137
00:09:52,787 --> 00:09:55,591
Those three forts are
there to prevent just
this sort of thing!

138
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:58,094
{\an1}<i>It's impossible</i>
<i>to get past them!</i>

139
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,766
{\an4}You! Are you a double
agent?! Did you conspire
with the men at the forts
to let these ninja in?

140
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,637
{\an1}No! No way! I swear,
I'd never do that!
You've gotta believe me!

141
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,340
Bah! Talk is cheap!

142
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:12,577
{\an1}Wait! I know! Those
shinobi think I've
been captured, right?

143
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:17,184
{\an1}<i>Well... if you convince them to</i>
<i>give up one of their group for</i>
<i>me in a hostage exchange,</i>

144
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:20,455
{\an1}<i>then I'll be able to</i>
<i>stall them and feed you</i>
<i>inside information!</i>

145
00:10:22,023 --> 00:10:22,957
Hmm...

146
00:10:24,592 --> 00:10:28,798
{\an1}<i>Not a bad idea.</i>
<i>After all, keeping</i>
<i>you here does me no good.</i>

147
00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:33,637
{\an1}<i>But if I can exchange you for</i>
<i>their leader, then I can crush</i>
<i>him along with their plans!</i>

148
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:37,508
{\an1}The more cards that I have to
play in this game, the better.

149
00:10:38,342 --> 00:10:41,313
{\an1}All right, guys!
Let's pulverize all
these crooks--!

150
00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:42,648
Slow down, Naruto.

151
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:43,450
What?!

152
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:45,351
Don't forget there's
still a hostage.

153
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,556
{\an1}<i>[Shikamaru]</i>
<i>Bringing down their hideout</i>
<i>might not be that difficult,</i>

154
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:52,561
{\an4}<i>but before we can do that,</i>
<i>we have to find and free</i>
<i>the village elder's</i>
<i>granddaughter.</i>

155
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:55,397
Oh. Right.

156
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,065
{\an1}But how?
What's the plan?

157
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:59,435
We'll take advantage
of their next move.

158
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:02,004
<i>[Sakura]</i>
<i>And what's that going to be?</i>

159
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:03,172
<i>[Shikamaru]</i>
<i>My guess is...</i>

160
00:11:03,806 --> 00:11:06,110
{\an1}... that they're going to try a
hostage exchange.

161
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:09,547
{\an1}Well that makes sense
if they want to avoid a
direct confrontation.

162
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:12,217
{\an1}Hold on: a hostage exchange?

163
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,121
You mean one of us will
have to become those
bandits' new hostage?

164
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:22,330
<i>Shikamaru!</i>

165
00:11:22,363 --> 00:11:24,499
I want to talk to you.
Show yourself!

166
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:27,269
If you want to save him,

167
00:11:27,302 --> 00:11:31,106
{\an1}Then you'll choose to
take his place and become
my captive instead!

168
00:11:32,342 --> 00:11:35,145
Hm. Just what I
was expecting.

169
00:11:36,413 --> 00:11:37,780
{\an1}So what's your answer?!

170
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:39,850
{\an1}Shikamaru?!

171
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:43,288
{\an1}Okay! Sounds good!

172
00:11:44,356 --> 00:11:45,558
Hm!

173
00:11:45,857 --> 00:11:47,894
{\an7}<i>He answered my question!</i>

174
00:11:48,194 --> 00:11:50,897
{\an1}So far, it's all going
just as I planned.

175
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,333
{\an1}Hurk! Urgh! Augh!

176
00:11:54,034 --> 00:11:56,404
{\an7}<i>What the-? My voice is gone!</i>

177
00:11:56,437 --> 00:12:00,241
{\an7}<i>Hmm. My Hidden Jutsu,</i>
<i>the Muting Jutsu.</i>

178
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:04,548
{\an7}<i>If you can't speak, you</i>
<i>can't convey any strategy</i>
<i>you might come up with!</i>

179
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,391
{\an7}<i>I just have to have</i>
<i>faith in them.</i>

180
00:12:14,091 --> 00:12:15,460
{\an1}What could he be thinking?!

181
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:17,095
That numbskull.

182
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:19,064
Hey! Don't go
off on your own!

183
00:12:19,097 --> 00:12:22,969
{\an1}Listen, Shikamaru would never do
anything unless he had a plan.

184
00:12:23,002 --> 00:12:23,970
He's right.

185
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:27,441
{\an1}Shikamaru said he'd
take advantage of this
hostage exchange.

186
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:31,313
{\an7}<i>But what did he mean by that?</i>

187
00:12:31,646 --> 00:12:32,648
Hm?

188
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,947
{\an1}I'm sorry for
all the trouble
that I caused.

189
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:02,684
You can knock off
the act anytime now.

190
00:13:02,718 --> 00:13:03,452
{\an1}Huh?

191
00:13:03,485 --> 00:13:04,486
Nngh!

192
00:13:04,953 --> 00:13:06,589
{\an1}We already know
that you're a spy.

193
00:13:06,623 --> 00:13:08,591
And we have
for a very
long time!

194
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,559
Heh heh
heh heh!

195
00:13:09,592 --> 00:13:11,495
{\an1}But then why-?!

196
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:12,730
Ah!

197
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:15,600
{\an1}Did you...
come here to
save me?

198
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:20,573
{\an1}How did you get
past the forts?

199
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,510
{\an1}Oh. Right.
You're still
under my jutsu.

200
00:13:25,545 --> 00:13:26,546
Release!

201
00:13:28,248 --> 00:13:30,384
Hey, It's going
to be all right.

202
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:33,321
{\an1}I asked how you got
past the forts!

203
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:35,123
That part was easy.

204
00:13:35,156 --> 00:13:36,358
Hm?

205
00:13:36,392 --> 00:13:39,528
{\an1}All of us were suspicious of
Tofu right from the very start.

206
00:13:40,563 --> 00:13:41,631
Because of that,

207
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:44,367
{\an1}<i>We secretly placed a</i>
<i>mini-wireless on him.</i>

208
00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:46,370
<i>[Baji]</i>
<i>What?!</i>

209
00:13:47,804 --> 00:13:50,941
{\an4}As we thought,
he said the password,
not knowing he was
giving it to us.

210
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,915
{\an1}The lilies on the mountain
pass shine at nighttime.

211
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:04,325
{\an1}But I've never fully
trusted passwords.

212
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:09,532
{\an4}Those guards at the forts
had strict orders, even
if someone did give them
the correct password!

213
00:14:09,831 --> 00:14:13,369
{\an1}Maybe. But it seems
they're not as
suspicious as you are.

214
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,938
{\an1}<i>All that we had to</i>
<i>do is tell them,</i>

215
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:19,811
{\an4}<i>"A spy who knows the</i>
<i>password should have</i>
<i>come through before us.</i>
<i>We're after him."</i>

216
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:23,314
{\an1}<i>And just like that,</i>
<i>they let us in.</i>

217
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:25,284
<i>[Baji]</i>
<i>They... What?!</i>

218
00:14:27,787 --> 00:14:29,888
{\an1}<i>It was a childish</i>
<i>trick, I know.</i>

219
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:32,092
{\an1}<i>But it worked well, so who</i>
<i>cares?</i>

220
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,293
Ungh.

221
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:38,099
{\an1}Well, you're certainly
no child, I'll give you
that much, Shikamaru.

222
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,805
{\an1}But still. even if you're
a smart tactician, you're
just a prisoner now.

223
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:47,377
{\an1}And I have my own strategy,
one that'll wipe out your
little genin friends!

224
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,647
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

225
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:53,852
{\an1}My friends are gonna be here
any minute to save us both.

226
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,722
{\an1}Don't bother trying to
put on a brave act!

227
00:14:57,055 --> 00:15:02,128
{\an4}Ninjutsu may be powerful,
but there's no way to
destroy this place without
harming the hostage.

228
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:05,132
{\an1}That's the whole
point of a hostage!

229
00:15:05,532 --> 00:15:06,933
Uh! Hold on...

230
00:15:08,503 --> 00:15:11,305
{\an1}If you knew that Tofu was
my spy, why'd you agree to
the hostage exchange?!

231
00:15:11,673 --> 00:15:12,674
Heh!

232
00:15:12,907 --> 00:15:14,109
{\an1}Gee, I wonder...

233
00:15:14,576 --> 00:15:15,544
Ugh!

234
00:15:15,845 --> 00:15:16,880
[explosion]

235
00:15:16,912 --> 00:15:17,913
Uh?

236
00:15:18,448 --> 00:15:19,449
Fire Style!

237
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,217
Fire Ball Jutsu!

238
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,293
{\an4}An assault? So the loss of
their leader causes the
genin to panic and attack,
heedless of the hostages.

239
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,096
<i>Or is this a</i>
<i>diversionary tactic?</i>

240
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:34,902
{\an1}<i>Either way, they can't attack at</i>
<i>full force when I have hostages.</i>

241
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:39,306
{\an1}And your genin friends lack the
jutsu to pinpoint our location.

242
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,980
{\an4}So I still have the upper
hand here. And there's no
way that you can possibly
come out on top.

243
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,556
{\an1}Just calm down! You know that
the boss has planned ahead
for situations like this!

244
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:56,059
{\an4}And this place is
a natural fort!
A large force
can't get in!

245
00:15:57,495 --> 00:15:59,096
{\an1}HWAAHHH!

246
00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:00,399
What's your deal?

247
00:16:00,432 --> 00:16:01,867
HUUHH!?

248
00:16:01,901 --> 00:16:03,402
<i>Boss! Trouble!</i>

249
00:16:03,435 --> 00:16:04,437
What's wrong?

250
00:16:04,938 --> 00:16:07,140
Sir! More shinobi
have appeared!

251
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:09,343
{\an1}All right, no
need to panic.

252
00:16:09,577 --> 00:16:14,048
{\an1}You can't fall apart every time!
I gave you contingency plans for
this kind of thing.

253
00:16:14,081 --> 00:16:15,817
Dh... Yes, but...

254
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:18,220
{\an1}We're facing a thousand men!
It's an army!

255
00:16:18,488 --> 00:16:20,590
A thousand?!
Ahh!

256
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:24,994
{\an1}[Naruto]
Hee hee!
Shikamaru's not here!

257
00:16:25,262 --> 00:16:27,665
{\an1}That means there's no one
to tell me not to do this!

258
00:16:28,332 --> 00:16:33,304
{\an1}Shikamaru and the hostage are in
the west tower. We have to make
sure not to destroy that one!

259
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:34,740
Right!
You got it,
Choji!

260
00:16:35,574 --> 00:16:36,308
Okay!

261
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:38,545
Expansion Jutsu!

262
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:41,214
Human Boulder!

263
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:43,049
{\an1}Yeah! Go get 'em, Choji!

264
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:46,020
Hm!

265
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:49,091
{\an1}You're so calm.
You even seem
to enjoy this!

266
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:51,594
Huh? What,
seriously? I do?

267
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,430
{\an1}Aren't you scared about
what might happen?

268
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:55,532
No way.

269
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,300
But why not?!

270
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,137
{\an1}Because I have faith
in my friends.

271
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,175
{\an1}Don't get overconfident, kid!
I still have the upper
hand, here!

272
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:08,046
I can escape by using
my hostage as a shield!

273
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,184
{\an1}You see, as long as I have
the girl with me, I can
negotiate my way out of here.

274
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,259
{\an4}<i>And if I can escape before</i>
<i>those genin brats get here,</i>
<i>all of your plans won't</i>
<i>mean a thing, anyway!</i>

275
00:17:19,028 --> 00:17:20,663
You'd abandon your
men like that?!

276
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,732
Those men down there?
What a laugh!

277
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:29,072
{\an5}you just don't get it!
Once I escape, I can
form a new gang
anytime I want!

278
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:35,112
Shikamaru!

279
00:17:37,082 --> 00:17:38,051
Oh! Good!

280
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,719
Are you both
all right?

281
00:17:39,752 --> 00:17:41,588
{\an1}Yeah. But just barely.

282
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:44,592
{\an1}How do you think we feel?!
You sure scared us!

283
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,362
How did you find
this place?

284
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:53,535
{\an1}She's from the Yamanaka clan of
the Hidden Leaf, and they have a
very powerful Hidden Jutsu.

285
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,507
{\an1}The Mind Transfer Jutsu.
I'm sure you've at least
heard it mentioned before.

286
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:00,944
{\an1}The Mind Transfer Jutsu?!

287
00:18:01,244 --> 00:18:03,081
{\an1}<i>When I first approached you,</i>

288
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:05,717
{\an1}All right! Mind Transfer Jutsu!

289
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:16,529
{\an1}<i>Then, using that Jutsu,</i>
<i>Ino looked through my eyes</i>
<i>and located our position.</i>

290
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:17,698
Release!

291
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:23,304
{\an1}You guys! I found out
where Shikamaru and the
hostage are being held!

292
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,743
{\an1}Now you know what happened.

293
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:30,279
{\an1}Give me a break, would
you? You act like we
had it all planned;

294
00:18:30,313 --> 00:18:32,816
{\an1}you're just lucky
I figured out what
you had in mind!

295
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,419
{\an1}<i>[Choji]</i>
<i>Yeah, it was touch-and-go</i>
<i>for a while there.</i>

296
00:18:35,452 --> 00:18:38,923
{\an1}But that's ludicrous!
How could you have possibly
known from the start

297
00:18:38,957 --> 00:18:42,394
that I would call for
a hostage exchange and
trade Tofu for you?!

298
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:47,601
{\an1}Well, when a player loses
a card, he wants to
replace it, doesn't he?

299
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:50,104
Ngh!
A card?

300
00:18:50,772 --> 00:18:56,078
{\an1}<i>In your case, the card you lost</i>
<i>was actually three things:</i>
<i>the forts we bypassed.</i>

301
00:18:56,111 --> 00:19:00,482
{\an1}<i>Once they were out of play,</i>
<i>you needed to replace them as</i>
<i>quickly as possible.</i>

302
00:19:01,117 --> 00:19:03,453
{\an1}<i>And the easiest and</i>
<i>fastest way to do that,</i>

303
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:08,126
{\an1}Was through an
exchange of hostages.

304
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,698
{\an4}You're a tactician.
You believe in
analyzing every bit
of data you get.

305
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,569
{\an1}And your top priority
is figuring out your
enemy's strategy.

306
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:20,406
{\an1}Because of that, I knew
right off the bat that
you would target me.

307
00:19:21,274 --> 00:19:23,011
{\an1}<i>And that's the</i>
<i>whole story.</i>

308
00:19:24,378 --> 00:19:25,312
He heh.

309
00:19:25,345 --> 00:19:26,881
That's simply amazing.

310
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:30,720
And you beat me.
I've got to hand
it to you.

311
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,255
{\an1}Nothing I did was amazing.

312
00:19:34,024 --> 00:19:38,295
{\an1}What is truly amazing is
that my friends believe
in me no matter what.

313
00:19:38,662 --> 00:19:39,597
Shut up!

314
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,631
Ha-hah!

315
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:42,800
{\an1}<i>[Baji]</i>
<i>Paper Bombs!</i>

316
00:19:44,335 --> 00:19:47,306
{\an4}Try to make a
move against me,
and I'll set these off
and blow you up!

317
00:19:47,673 --> 00:19:49,976
{\an1}You hear me? Make
a move and I'll--

318
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:51,145
Hngh!

319
00:19:51,811 --> 00:19:54,582
{\an1}Shadow Possession Jutsu.
Gotcha.

320
00:19:55,449 --> 00:19:56,584
Aah!

321
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:00,622
{\an4}[Kakashi]
My, my, This year's
rookies are quite
talented, aren't they?

322
00:20:01,456 --> 00:20:04,994
{\an1}[Asuma]
We heard everything, Shikamaru.
That was quite a risk you took,

323
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:08,397
{\an1}going in there alone
without telling the
others your strategy.

324
00:20:08,632 --> 00:20:12,971
{\an1}Despite that, the mission
ended successfully.
Well done, Shikamaru.

325
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,673
Thanks, but it really
wasn't a risk.

326
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,376
You see,

327
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,815
{\an1}I knew what my friends could
accomplish, and I had faith in
what we could achieve together.

328
00:20:22,783 --> 00:20:26,653
{\an1}<i>I didn't have to tell them a</i>
<i>thing; I knew these guys would</i>
<i>know what I was thinking.</i>

329
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:35,697
{\an4}<i>When I think about those</i>
<i>old missions, Team 10</i>
<i>always had each other's</i>
<i>backs during battle.</i>

330
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:40,738
{\an1}<i>No, that's not quite right.</i>
<i>It wasn't just Team 10.</i>
<i>It was all of us!</i>

331
00:20:41,138 --> 00:20:43,275
<i>Naruto,</i>
<i>Lee, Kiba...</i>

332
00:20:43,307 --> 00:20:48,446
{\an1}<i>And now, our faith in our</i>
<i>friends has spread beyond just</i>
<i>our own individual teams.</i>

333
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,083
{\an1}<i>It encompasses the</i>
<i>entire village.</i>

334
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,287
{\an1}<i>Wouldn't you agree, Asuma?</i>

335
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,394
{\an1}Well, what do you say, you guys?
Should we go back and
have some barbecue?

336
00:21:00,895 --> 00:21:02,330
Yeah!

337
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:04,432
Hey, wait up!

338
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:08,205
As punishment, you get
to carry all this back
to the village, Choji.

339
00:21:08,637 --> 00:21:11,708
Aw, come on!
Help me out,
would ya?

340
00:21:12,075 --> 00:21:13,077
[chuckle]

341
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,615
{\an1}<i>People may call me a</i>
<i>tactician who plays his</i>
<i>cards close to his chest,</i>

342
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,253
{\an1}<i>But these guys know everything</i>
<i>there is to know about me.</i>

343
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:58,171
<i>[Tsunade]</i>
<i>I have a mission for Team 7!</i>

344
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:02,575
{\an1}<i>But it appears things are</i>
<i>not going well between</i>
<i>Naruto and Sasuke.</i>

345
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:04,912
{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>I'm embarrassed to admit it,</i>
<i>but they're not.</i>

346
00:23:07,114 --> 00:23:09,384
{\an4}<i>[Tsunade]</i>
<i>I guess it can't be helped.</i>
<i>You and Sasuke will handle</i>
<i>this mission, then.</i>

347
00:23:09,985 --> 00:23:12,087
{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>What shall I do with</i>
<i>Naruto and Sakura?</i>

348
00:23:12,487 --> 00:23:15,791
{\an1}<i>[Tsunade]</i>
<i>Don't worry. I have the</i>
<i>perfect assignment for them.</i>

349
00:23:15,825 --> 00:23:20,330
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden,</i>
<i>"Drive Towards Darkness."</i>

350
00:23:20,364 --> 00:23:22,333
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>This is for the good</i>
<i>of the mission, too!</i>
