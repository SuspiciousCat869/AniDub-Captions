1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,375
[GINA] I take it you've
never been this far west?

2
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,875
These days it's basically
a demilitarized zone.

3
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:21,125
[GEORGE] The company he
worked for went bankrupt.

4
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:22,875
We pretty much lost everything.

5
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,208
[MATTHEW] Seems, uh,
like quite the happy place,

6
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,708
'least to hear them tell it.

7
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,750
[GINA] We can only protect
people by eliminating Horrors.

8
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,250
Even then, the price
they pay is high.

9
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,666
[MATTHEW]
Let me ride your wave of glory

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,541
all the way back
to Russell City!

11
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,125
[SWORD]
Fade away into the darkness!

12
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,583
[GINA]
In the end, no battle can help

13
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:47,333
but leave a trail of collateral
damage in its wake.

14
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:48,416
There's nothing we can do

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,791
about the pain victims
feel afterwards.

16
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,083
Let's move.

17
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,375
Is that the place
we're looking for?

18
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:13,541
[SWORD]
Probably.

19
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,333
I'm not clear on the details.

20
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,250
We're on the right track,

21
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:29,291
according to the
info I've gathered so far.

22
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,375
El Dorado should be dead ahead.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,333
Hidden in these mountains,
I'm willing to bet.

24
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:40,750
The intel I have matches
up with yours for the most part.

25
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,166
People east of Russell City

26
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,375
have been traveling out
this way in droves.

27
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:48,458
"Eternal happiness
awaits you in El Dorado.

28
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,708
Gone will be the pain

29
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:52,375
and suffering that have
plagued your existence."

30
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,291
Yeah, but I mean,
what is it, exactly?

31
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:58,958
Heh. If we knew, this'd
be a walk in the park.

32
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:02,416
We could ask
the Land of Guidance.

33
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,333
Seems kind of risky.

34
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,791
You sure?

35
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,250
[GINA]
Yeah.

36
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,416
Might as well.

37
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,541
We're in the neighborhood.

38
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,583
[SWORD]
It's a secret location.

39
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,041
Kind of a hideout
for Alchemists.

40
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,416
Real mysterious.

41
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,583
Like the name implies,
it's where they go for help.

42
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,375
Question is,
will it "guide" us to El Dorado?

43
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:25,708
Sure.

44
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,208
Only problem being
without the right qualifications

45
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,250
you might get yourself
chucked off a cliff.

46
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,666
Huh?!

47
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,458
Don't be a jerk!

48
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,250
[SWORD]
Knock it off!

49
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,083
I'm trying to drive!

50
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,125
[GINA] We go the
rest of the way on foot.

51
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,833
How much further?

52
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,375
Seriously.

53
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,125
People actually live out here?

54
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,208
Huh?

55
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,916
We're almost there.

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,416
Look.

57
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,000
Ah!

58
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,125
[GINA]
Ferre Salé Dessimo.

59
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,875
Holy cow!

60
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,625
[GINA] The Makai Alchemist
village of trials.

61
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,666
It's so bouncy!

62
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,875
It's like I'm walkin'
on a sponge.

63
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,291
[GINA]
Woven reeds.

64
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,375
Whole commune's built on
floating islands of this stuff.

65
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,166
[GINA] Legend has it Alchemists
created this mini archipelago

66
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,791
as a refuge from
the never-ending fight.

67
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,833
Here, the old ways
persist unaltered.

68
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,875
Madou tools are crafted.

69
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,666
Obscure and
forgotten technologies

70
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,416
are studied in-depth.

71
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,583
[CHILD A]
Gina! You're back!

72
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,583
[CHILD B]
How long you gonna stay?

73
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,875
Sorry, my dears.

74
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,000
'Fraid I'm only passing
through on a job.

75
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,541
Goodness gracious,
look at all of you!

76
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,708
Hey! They let me on
the fishing boats now!

77
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,791
Isn't that great?

78
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,208
No kidding? That's incredible!

79
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,541
[CHILD C]
Miss Gina! Miss Gina!

80
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,583
I'm learning how
to make amulets!

81
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:09,875
[GINA]
Oooo!

82
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,083
I'll have to get you
to make me one next time!

83
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,458
[ELDER] I thought
things seemed livelier.

84
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,333
Makai Alchemist Gina,

85
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:19,375
I can't remember
the last time you visited.

86
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,958
Greetings, Elder.

87
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,791
[ELDER]
Rare of you to bring friends.

88
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,791
But a young girl? Hmm?

89
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,125
Huh?

90
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,333
Ah. Never mind.

91
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,500
A certain gun-toting colleague
of yours travelled here

92
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,875
not too long ago to
partake of the trials.

93
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,166
You mean Luke.

94
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,416
[ELDER]
Hmm?

95
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,041
Secluded though we are here,

96
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:51,625
persistent enough
rumors do reach us.

97
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,625
It would appear
El Dorado has grown

98
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:57,041
into something
of a hornet's nest.

99
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:04,875
That one's brand new.

100
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,750
We just rolled out
the prototype.

101
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,333
You can fire it from a gun.

102
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:12,541
Or, as is, use it to invoke
one honey of an explosion.

103
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,458
I'm a fan.

104
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,125
Thank you.

105
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,375
[GINA] What else you
got I haven't seen?

106
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,041
[CRAFTSMAN]
Feast your eyes on this.

107
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,416
Monster Gatling gun.

108
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,416
Specially designed
to shoot 6,000 rounds

109
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,708
of Alchemist ammo per second.

110
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:30,416
Not cheap, but uh,
worth every cent.

111
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,833
Great, throw it in.

112
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,291
Cash okay?

113
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,583
[CRAFTSMAN]
Yes, ma'am!

114
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,791
[ELDER] The Land of Guidance
is beyond this village,

115
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,458
hovering above a mountain peak.

116
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,916
It is sacred.

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,208
Normally only
Makai Alchemists may enter.

118
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,500
You friend will be an exception.

119
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,916
Gina asks that I permit you
and the girl to accompany her.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,083
Are you sure?

121
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,708
Sophie was born
under a curious star,

122
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,750
thus shall her fate unfold.

123
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,291
In the not-so-distant future,

124
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:07,583
that child's actions will
shake the world to its core.

125
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,250
[SOPHIE]
Sword!

126
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,500
You won't believe it!

127
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,791
Wow! Just wow!

128
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,541
When Gina goes shopping,
she spends more money

129
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:25,000
than most people make
in their entire life!

130
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,416
She does have
extravagant tastes.

131
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,750
Though you gotta wonder
how many men she's made weep

132
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,166
collecting a fee.

133
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,458
What d'you mean?

134
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,583
You're too young to understand.

135
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,666
Nothing wrong with a
gal living by her wits,

136
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,041
is there?

137
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,166
Wait. Are you trying
to tell me she's--?

138
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,458
Uh. No!

139
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,208
I'm just sayin' she knows
how to break hearts.

140
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,125
And, she can be
a tad bit greedy.

141
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,416
Heads up.

142
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,625
Apologies.

143
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,000
Did you have a pleasant
chat with the elder?

144
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,666
[SWORD]
I suppose.

145
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:55,833
Whoa.

146
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,458
Those Madou tools?

147
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,708
What? These?

148
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,583
Just an accessory
that caught my eye.

149
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,000
It may be our duty
to eliminate Horrors,

150
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,333
but I still have to
take care of Gina.

151
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,333
No rule against spoiling
ourselves, is there?

152
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:16,375
[laughs]

153
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:41,875
[SWORD]
Some of that over here please!

154
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,208
[WOMAN B]
Here.

155
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,250
[WOMAN A]
Enjoy.

156
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,208
There's plenty more
that came from.

157
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,458
The net almost
wasn't big enough!

158
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:53,791
[laughs]

159
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,083
Tell us a story from
one of your missions!

160
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:59,083
[GINA laughs]

161
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,625
[WOMAN A] My! You've got
a healthy appetite!

162
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,083
[laughs]

163
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:12,916
You sure know how

Used to them?

My upbringing.

00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,916
Believe it or not I grew up
in an orphanage like you.

170
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,125
Have you finished
with the preparations?

challenge the Land of Guidance,

may the path to what
you seek be clear.

[SOPHIE] What d'you think made
Gina choose this sort of life?

175
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:28,583
Huh?

176
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,416
I asked her about it once.

177
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,291
Didn't get an answer.

178
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,208
Thanks for the ride!

179
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,750
Amazing.

180
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,875
I had no idea a world
like this even existed.

Even the weapons
they use are a mystery.

It's just...

185
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:18,833
I'm in the middle of it now,
and I barely know anything.

186
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,666
I feel like an idiot.

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,000
Some things
it's better not to know.

00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,166
Don't sweat it.

189
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,250
But you're so alone.

Wait for it.

198
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,791
The temple only appears
under a full moon.

seeing as a gateway.

00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,583
[GINA]
That inscription.

"Those who seek guidance

[MIA]
A stone of protection.

That which reflects all magic.

Shielding from danger

Greetings, Land of Guidance.

It's been a while.

[SWORD] The temple guardian

as a mouthpiece?

Gotta admit I didn't
see that comin.

[GINA] Yeah, he can be
surprising like that.

248
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,125
This is the spirit that's
guided Makai Alchemists

249
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,291
since time immemorial.

250
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,500
You, whom the
darkness known as "King"

251
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,250
would stop at nothing to seize.

252
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,166
Will you be the key
to this calamity?

[gasps]

254
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,541
So you've heard of the guy.

255
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,333
That's encouraging.

256
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,041
I do not claim omniscience.

257
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,083
Such knowledge
as I have is meager.

258
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:15,458
His name is carved
in ancient prophecy.

259
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,250
The eternal being.

260
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:20,083
He and the ring
he forged are everlasting.

261
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:27,625
A timeless,
inextinguishable evil.

262
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,416
One that evades destruction

263
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,750
through unequaled
guile and cunning.

264
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,333
Never is his power direct.

265
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,000
Rather, he delights
to see others dally

266
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:42,541
and drown in the
power he bestows.

267
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:46,083
The ring is the
crystallization of that power.

268
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,875
With it, he not only
controls darkness,

269
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,583
but is darkness personified.

270
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:56,583
Commanding freely those ravenous
beings known as Horrors.

271
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,500
Whosoever comes into possession
of the ring is changed

272
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,916
by the vileness within.

273
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,291
It renders the
heart's desire manifest.

274
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,541
So let me get this straight.

275
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,208
Our guy's been around a while,
and he has a ring lets him

276
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,041
get his hooks into
people like Knight.

277
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,583
Wait, so it's not a myth?

278
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,875
Something like
that really exists?

279
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:22,375
[MIA] The King has established a
seat of power and christened it

280
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,208
El Dorado.

281
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:27,791
The reason I cannot yet see.

282
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,958
I fear catastrophe
awaits all mankind.

283
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,000
Please, wise spirit.

284
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:38,083
Show me by what road
I might come to what we seek.

285
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,666
Your resolve is strong.

286
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,375
I see it.

287
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,291
Go now.

288
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,416
Leave here.

289
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
East of this peaceful land

290
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:48,250
sprawls a city men
call El Sanvados.

291
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,458
South of that, you will
find the gathering dark.

292
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,291
But beware the truth.

293
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:57,041
Veiled in shadow,
what you seek lies waiting.

294
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,833
Impenetrable even to my gaze.

295
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:03,041
So very deep does it dwell.

296
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,583

00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,708
Are you okay?

307
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,958
I, uh...

308
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:39,708
Yeah.

Ugh! What the hell's goin' on?

312
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:08,000
Okay. Guess we're done.

313
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:12,708
We got what we came for.

314
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,416
Yes, we did.

Excellent work, Mia. Thanks.

318
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,208
This is yours.

319
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,250
Take care of it.

320
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,166
[SOPHIE]
But, you...!

321
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,375
You're the one who earned it!

322
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,875
The trial was just a formality.

323
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,250
Known my path for a while.

324
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:47,083
Heh. Ever since I was young.

325
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,125
Aw, don't worry.

326
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,666
The whole point of
this was to get a line on

327
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,958
where to find
El Dorado, right?

328
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:55,750
Go on.

329
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:56,916
The stone belongs to you.

330
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,833
Consider it a gift.

331
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:01,791
Huh?

332
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,166
Hey, remember what the
Land of Guidance told you.

333
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,166
Without an iron purpose,
that stone is nothing.

334
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,208
Just a pretty rock
glinting in the light.

335
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:20,250
You wanna call on its power?
You gotta dig deep.
