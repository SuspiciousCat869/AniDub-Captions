1
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,416
Right! Throttle
the Golden Knight,

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,916
but spare the feisty
young girl for His Majesty.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,166
Zaruba!

4
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,125
[DARK KNIGHT]
A worthy nemesis.

5
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:28,083
I look forward
to our next meeting.

6
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,791
[QUEEN] The mouth that
dare befoul his name?

7
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:34,583
The eyes that dare
show a glint of malice?

8
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:38,125
Such feeble impudence
I cannot abide.

9
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:42,416
As long as I breathe,
no harm shall ever come to you.

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,791
[BISHOP]
Eh. So be it.

11
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:47,458
El Dorado's true worth
is lost on cretins like him.

12
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,333
[QUEEN]
The true El Dorado.

13
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,333
It's time has come.

14
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:04,750
Our desire will at
long last come to fruition.

15
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,041
You know your role, yes?

16
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:11,375
I notice Knight isn't here.

17
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:15,083
The princess and her entourage
are proving quite troublesome.

18
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,625
That's twice
they've given him the slip.

19
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:23,000
Our master's orders
carry the weight of a dictum.

20
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,708
She must be brought
here immediately.

21
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,750
Failure is unacceptable.

22
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:30,083
This we do for
the sake of His Majesty.

23
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,125
Things are exactly
as we planned.

24
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,083
Excellent news indeed, sir.

25
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:47,250
Bring the girl here intact.

26
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,416
Why the King should be so
obsessed over such a trifle

27
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,416
I cannot begin to fathom.

28
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:57,666
Still, we have our directives.

29
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,250
It can't be helped.

30
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,666
[SWORD]
That the data you got from Alan?

31
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,916
[SOPHIE]
Mm-hmm.

32
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,458
Pretty juicy stuff about
the GarEden Corporation.

33
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,916
Believe it or not,

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,166
they actually started out as
a small software business.

35
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,083
Ten years ago, they
expanded into electronics.

36
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:00,166
Put out a bunch
of innovative products.

37
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,041
Needless to say,
they grew like crazy.

38
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,500
Ten years, you said?

39
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,041
'Cording to this, yeah.

40
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,791
Lot of high profile
developers came over

41
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,000
when they merged
with this other company.

42
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,083
There it is.

43
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:15,166
Something called
Cygunsura... Cygnusra...

44
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,750
[SWORD]
Cygnusram-Tech?

45
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah! That's the one!

46
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,500
[SHOP OWNER] We have evidence
that strongly suggests Horrors

47
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:30,083
were involved in the massive
explosion at Cygnusram-Tech.

48
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,583
Sword?

49
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,666
What's wrong?

50
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,541
Uh. No worries.

51
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,125
I'm fine.

52
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,708
So many people in this city.

53
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,166
Can all of 'em be,
I mean, really?

54
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,750
[LUKE]
No.

55
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,458
More than half the population is
human, going about their lives.

56
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,458
The poor souls have no idea what
monsters are surrounding them.

57
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,833
[SWORD] If we can get inside,
we'll at least have an idea

58
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,750
what the "true"
El Dorado is all about.

59
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,625
[SOPHIE] That's where
I'll find my brother.

60
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,750
[SWORD] We'll wait for
nightfall and do some B and E.

61
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,208
Objections?

62
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,458
[LUKE] Only to the way
you stuff your face.

63
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,416
[SWORD chuckles]
Good one.

64
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,000
The body needs fuel.

65
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:23,000
Can't get a helluva lot
done by starving ourselves.

66
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,791
Hey! Miss?

67
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,333
One pizza with everything
and a golden parfait, please!

68
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,750
Oh, and another
orange juice while I'm at it.

69
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,458
Also, two cheese
burgers medium rare

70
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,250
and a side of
mashed potatoes to go!

71
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,125
Thank you!

72
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,541
Yeah. Sure thing.

73
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,666
[SOPHIE] Better add an
order of fried rice with that.

74
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,375
And some gyoza.

75
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,666
And some dandan noodles.

76
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,375
Do you have dandan noodles?

77
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,291
I hope you're okay, Martin.

78
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,375
Be safe.

79
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,500
[SWORD]
Must've been some big brother.

80
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,333
[SOPHIE]
Mm-hmm.

81
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:08,333
Whatever I got myself into,
he took care of me.

82
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,958
I was a handful, too.

83
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:10,875
But Martin?

84
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,833
He didn't mind.

85
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,750
He never once got upset
or raised his voice.

86
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,375
So, uh... In other words,
the total opposite of me.

87
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,208
[SOPHIE chuckles]

88
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,375
C'mon.

89
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,333
You're the one who
got us here, remember?

90
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,958
If I was by myself.

91
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,166
I'd probably still be
running around Russell City

92
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,750
with no idea where to go.

93
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,666
This is all thanks to you.

94
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,833
[SWORD]
Well, they don't call me

95
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,500
the strongest
Makai Knight for nothin'.

96
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,541
[SOPHIE giggles]

97
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:41,083
Sword? I'm glad
you're my travel buddy.

98
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,333
[LUKE]
Hey.

99
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,625
We've got a bit of
a situation on our hands.

100
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,208
You'd better come look.

101
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,250
[SOPHIE gasps]

102
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,791
What happened?

103
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,791
[LUKE]
Plants from Makai.

104
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,208
Stay as close to us as you can.

105
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,166
Let's move.

106
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,625
Even in here?

107
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,750
But where did
all the workers go?

108
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,500
[distant screaming]

109
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,708
[gunshot]

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,500
[SWORD]
What's the story?

111
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,958
[DENNIS]
It all happened so fast.

112
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:49,125
Those things just sprang
on us out of nowhere.

113
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,125
Everyone was...

114
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,458
They all...

115
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,500
We couldn't...

116
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,083
The humans have outgrown
their usefulness, then.

117
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,708
[SWORD] How can these monsters
be so bald-faced about it?

118
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,458
They're not even trying
to hide anymore!

119
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,666
[LUKE] It would seem
they don't feel the need.

120
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,625
Meaning, it's probably
safe to assume

121
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,708
the true El Dorado is complete.

122
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:12,125
[SOPHIE] So, um, are
there any other survivors?

123
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,666
I don't know.

124
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,125
I saw a bunch of people
running in that direction.

125
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,166
[SWORD]
There's no one here.

126
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,833
[QUEEN] I hate to
break it to you, but...

127
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,791
...you were doomed
the moment you entered.

128
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:58,625
Accept your hopeless position
and hand over the girl.

129
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,833
[SWORD]
Yeah, sorry.

130
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,416
I'm gonna have some
trouble with that one.

131
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,375
The hell you don't!

132
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,458
[QUEEN chuckles]

133
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,041
Ah, "one who protects," is it?

134
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,291
Admirable.

135
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,000
Until you are betrayed
by those you protect.

136
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,500
[SWORD]
What?

137
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,958
Life lesson.
Never let your guard down.

138
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:58,750
Huh?

139
00:09:58,833 --> 00:09:59,583
What d'you mean?

140
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,583
[laughs]

141
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,875
[shrieks]

142
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,916
You bastard!

143
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,333
Help me!

144
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,625
[SWORD]
Let her go!

145
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,208
Catch ya later.

146
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,500
[LUKE] That was a Makai
Alchemist's handiwork.

147
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:45,125
There's affectively zero chance
we'll be able to track him.

148
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,791
Try not to lose your head.

149
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,041
That's exactly what they want.

150
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,875
You're right, sorry.

151
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,291
[LUKE]
I was prepared for this.

152
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:00,583
You're a coward!

153
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:01,666
Fools.

154
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,666
They only pay
attention to Horrors.

155
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,375
This is what stunts a
Makai Knight's development.

156
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,583
They must learn to broaden
the scope of their concern.

157
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,333
Welcome.

158
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,375
This is our Holy Land.

159
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,541
Ah. What am I even looking at?

160
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,125
[DR. STANLEY]
Nothing less than the byproduct

161
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,041
of the true El Dorado.

162
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,291
Observe if you will.

163
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,208
The crystallization
of wisdom itself!

164
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,250
One cannot help but stand in awe

165
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,625
of such towering,
unadulterated beauty!

166
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,083
And yet, the happiness it brings

167
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,958
lies beyond the
comprehension of most.

168
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,791
Benighted, obsolete dunces.

169
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:09,125
I conducted experiments on a
mere ten or twenty human beings,

170
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,000
and they condemned
me as a madman.

171
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,375
In their blindness,

172
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,708
they even sought to destroy
my inestimable research!

173
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,208
But then, he came.

174
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:19,083
Master Bishop understands
the purpose of my life's work.

175
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,500
In fact, the man praises
me as a genius.

176
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,541
He even told me I was needed...

177
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,041
...desperately.

178
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,666
And now, behold!

179
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,833
In the true El Dorado, the King
himself awaits his princess!

180
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,500
No! Come on!

181
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,041
[DR. STANLEY] As expected of
the girl His Majesty covets.

182
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,958
Stimulation is
the spark of life!

183
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,666
What revelations may
come of contemplating you!

184
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,958
What heretofore untouched
heights of intellect!

185
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,041
Running away will get
you nowhere, my child.

186
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,791
[SOPHIE]
How do I get out of here?

187
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,750
[gasps]

188
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,500
Martin?

189
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,208
No denying it.

190
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,541
This was Martin's room.

191
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,916
I can tell.

192
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,250
"GarEden's facility was
far more sophisticated

193
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,000
than I ever expected.

194
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,500
I'm certain my research will
become a reality here."

195
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,166
[MARTIN] A dream apparatus
that can liberate people

196
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,458
from various forms of suffering.

197
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,000
Once the apparatus is complete,

198
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:09,500
I know I can make
Sophie happy again.

199
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,875
Ever since mom and dad passed,

200
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:15,416
she's been put
through so much pain.

201
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,916
And that's why I want to put
a smile on Sophie's face.

202
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,125
That's my only wish.

203
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,166
[SOPHIE]
Hang on a little longer.

204
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,333
I promise I'll create
a future for you, Sophie.

205
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,541
Just you wait.

206
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,666
This whole time.

207
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,166
He was thinking of me.

208
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,916
Everything he did was for me.

209
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,833
"I'm finally
writing back, Martin!"

210
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:03,375
"Your research is important, but
you have to eat properly, too."

211
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,958
I didn't write this.

212
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,000
What the...?

213
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,291
Who did?

214
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,000
[DR. STANLEY]
Thought you could hide?

215
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:15,291
[laughs]

216
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:21,916
Tell me the truth!

217
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,708
Where's Martin?

218
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,750
What did you do with him?

219
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,250
Huh?

220
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,208
[DR. STANLEY laughs]

221
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,625
The people of this fair city.

222
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:40,708
Or rather, former people
of this fair city, I should say.

223
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,500
These are all actually people?

224
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,958
[DR. STANLEY]
Quite so.

225
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,333
And how fortunate they are
to have directly contributed

226
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,708
to such a grandiose
invention as this.

227
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,458
[SOPHIE]
My brother's in there, isn't he?

228
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,083
Isn't he?

229
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,458
Are you scared?

230
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,000
Tell me why!

231
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,625
Why do something like this?

232
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,250
[QUEEN]
Because the King desired it.

233
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,583
Thus it becomes part of reality.

234
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,250
What he wishes, I make so.

235
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,583
Therefore.

236
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,333
I am bound to despise
impediments like you.

237
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,375
I thought...

238
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,250
You said that
the King wanted me?

239
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,500
Indeed he does.

240
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,000
Worry not, child.

241
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,958
In the Holy Land the concept
of injury holds no meaning.

242
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,541
Those who go to
the true El Dorado

243
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,208
can never again
return to this world.

244
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,375
So it shall be for you.

245
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,083
[SWORD] Looks like
we got here just in time.

246
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,041
Sword! Luke!

247
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,041
[SWORD]
We knew your location,

248
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,750
we just didn't know
how to get here.

249
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,541
So we thought,
why not take a shortcut?

250
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,583
Hang in there a
little longer, Sophie.

251
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,833
We'll wrap this up real quick.

252
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:02,708
My Queen, I...

253
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,458
...will leave it to you.

254
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,541
[SWORD]
Hold it!

255
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,750
Let me handle this,
you go after Sophie!

256
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,458
Now!

257
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,625
[SWORD]
Outta my way!

258
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,291
Worry about me, not him.

259
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,500
Say goodnight!

260
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,750
Sophie!

261
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,625
I'm okay.

262
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,833
[BISHOP]
My gracious.

263
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,583
What ever do we have here?

264
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,708
Dr. Stanley?

265
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,291
I-I'm so sorry, Master Bishop!

266
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,208
Please, sir.

267
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,041
I...

268
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,833
Have mercy on me, I beg you!

269
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,416
[BISHOP] I suppose there's
nothing to be done for it now.

270
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,625
It's only fair I get some use
out of you, don't you think?

271
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,750
There. You have a few seconds
before the good doctor explodes.

272
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,500
I daresay you're screwed.

273
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,416
Don't want the princess
caught in the blast.

274
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,333
That might very well cause
trouble for the both of us.

275
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,416
Best make a decision.

276
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,125
So, what's to be done?

277
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,500
We'll resume this later.

278
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,416
[gasps]

279
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,125
No! Sword!

280
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,791
Please, no!

281
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,916
What did you
think of my fireworks?

282
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:14,750
Come now, darling.

283
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,333
Enjoy yourself, huh?

284
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,875
[SOPHIE shrieks]

285
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,000
Sophie!

286
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:26,583
[MARTIN]
I thought you'd never get here.

287
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,125
Hey, sis.
