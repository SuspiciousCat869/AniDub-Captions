1
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:14,833
[KING chuckles]
Futile.

2
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:17,458
This world and I
are one and the same.

3
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,000
You cannot vanquish me.

4
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:20,083
[SWORD]
Then I guess it looks like

5
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,375
I have to take out
an entire world!

6
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:25,000
[ZARUBA]
Here, use this!

7
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,666
[SWORD]
Yes!

8
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:35,791
It can't be.

9
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,083
Garo.

10
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,500
I... I don't want
anyone else to die.

11
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,291
Help me.

12
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,291
Give me strength.

13
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,666
Whatever you've got!

14
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,375
Please! Help me protect him!

15
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,041
This is for Sword!

16
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,291
[SWORD] I missed my window
outta here 'cause of you.

17
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,291
So, now what?

18
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,500
[DARK KNIGHT]
As of the ancient one's demise,

19
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:31,791
my contract with
the ring is null and void.

20
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:34,375
I stand before you
a creature of agency,

21
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:37,041
a warrior answerable to no one.

22
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,375
I am my own master.

23
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:43,291
My very soul has existed
for this moment alone!

24
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:48,958
Come, Golden Knight,
let us settle this!

25
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,375
Well, damn.

26
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:53,458
You ever hear of quittin'
while you're ahead maybe?

27
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,833
[SWORD] This is what we
call a teachable moment.

28
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:05,708
[SWORD] Allow me to
show you real strength!

29
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,000
[SOPHIE]
Gina.

30
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,000
Luke.

31
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,458
Well done.

32
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,083
I'm proud of you, Sophie.

33
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,208
Thanks.

34
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,666
That means a lot.

35
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,083
Hey, where's Sword at?

36
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,666
I made his sister a promise.

37
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,875
[SWORD]
Shame you're such a jackass.

38
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:15,041
Kind of heft you've got,
we coulda faced Makai itself.

39
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,041
Taken out the Horror
scourge at its source.

40
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,958
[DARK KNIGHT]
Don't speak to me of shame.

41
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,500
With your unparalleled might,

42
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,416
you could have blazoned
your name in the stars

43
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,000
and taken pride of place

44
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,291
among the greatest
warriors of all time.

45
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,166
Your legend would
have endured for eternity!

46
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,458
[SWORD] My strength has
nothing to do with me.

47
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,958
It's theirs.

48
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,333
I fight for those who can't
take up arms for themselves.

49
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,666
For them.

50
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,250
I pit whatever I have
against the likes of you!

51
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,333
[DARK KNIGHT]
Then you're a fool!

52
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,333
[DARK KNIGHT]
Now that was a fight.

53
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,500
Thank you, my brother.

54
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,291
That was delightful.

55
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,125
[SOPHIE]
Say something.

56
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,708
What's going on?

57
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:47,916
He should be here.

58
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,208
Somebody tell me why
Sword hasn't come back!

59
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,666
Are you listening?

60
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,291
Luke!

61
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,583
Gina!

62
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,916
Why won't you talk to me?

63
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,291
[SOPHIE]
Let go of my arm!

64
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,166
No!

65
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,333
I'm not leaving without Sword!

66
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,375
Stop it!

67
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,583
He's still in there!

68
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:11,833
We can't.

69
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,708
[sob]

70
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:18,291
He'd go back for me if it
were the other way around!

71
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,083
We can't just leave him!

72
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,166
It's not right and you know it!

73
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,041
Stop!

74
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,708
I want to protect him!

75
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:41,333
Luke.

76
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,958
Please don't.

77
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,416
[LUKE]
I'm sorry.

78
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,791
Sword asked me to do this.

79
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,458
Forgive me, Sophie.

80
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,083
No!

81
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:55,833
Gina!

82
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:56,958
Don't let him!

83
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,625
I'm begging you!

84
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,958
Wait.

85
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,458
It's been lovely.

86
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,416
Goodbye.

00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,208
[NEWSCASTER] It's been
a year since Russell City

91
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,291
was devastated by
a freak hurricane,

92
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,458
but the pace of reconstruction
continues to increase.

93
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,791
In other news,
official reports regarding

94
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,791
the internet security breach
felt by users the world over

95
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,166
last year have been
released to the public.

96
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,041
Authorities attribute the
upset to high-level hackers,

97
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,750
but have yet to name
a specific group.

[KIDS]
Mr. Brooks!

100
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,333
How's everybody doing?

101
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,208
Whoa-ho!
What's with the bag?

102
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,333
Oh, nothing fancy.

103
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,041
Just some early
Christmas presents

104
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,000
for you good girls and boys.

105
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,083
Hey, Sophie!

106
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:47,916
Get a move on.

107
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,166
Mr. Brooks brought us swag!

108
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,416
Hello?

109
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:54,500
Sorry.

110
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,250
Be right there.

111
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,125
[MR. BROOKS] Just about the
whole neighborhood pitched

112
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,875
in a little something
for you kids.

113
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,208
It's not much, of course.

114
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,750
Suppose I ought'a let you in
on what they told me about how

115
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,666
this place is gonna
be run from now on.

116
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,833
They've finally
reached a decision.

117
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:14,708
Awesome.

118
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,208
That's great news.

119
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,875
We're supposed to
have a sit-down tomorrow

120
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,291
with a representative
from the church.

121
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,916
I'm, uh, sorry for
keeping you all waiting

122
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,458
on an answer for so long.

123
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,541
Hey, better late
than never, right?

124
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,291
Things haven't been the
same here without Sister.

125
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,333
But, when we come together
there's nothing we can't do.

126
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,583
She wouldn't have wanted
it any other way.

127
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,000
How the neighborhood
has pitched in for us

128
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,791
would've made her happy.

129
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,083
Must've been
especially rough on you,

130
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,291
seeing as how you're the oldest.

131
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,583
I did okay.

132
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,875
But know what helped?

133
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,833
Martin watching over me.

134
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,208
[SOPHIE] Four years ago,
Martin died in an accident.

135
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:00,000
The Sister helped me
though the worst of it.

136
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,333
But now she's gone, too.

137
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:08,125
[SOPHIE] Still, I hold onto
the memories I have of them.

138
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,041
[sighs]

139
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,291
You are totally
spacing out again.

140
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,875
No. I'm not!

141
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,750
Somebody's got a
secret crush, huh?

142
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:32,500
[SOPHIE]
Gross.

143
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,166
[ANNE]
Nice try!

144
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,916
Bet I know who it is!
It's totally Andrew!

145
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,041
[SOPHIE] It's nothing
like that! Knock it off!

146
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,375
[SOPHIE] Right now,
more than anything, what I want

147
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:47,083
is to make new memories with
the people who're still here.

148
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,583
[ANNE]
Ugh. This sucks.

149
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:55,250
Remind me again why we couldn't
just call and have them deliver?

150
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,541
I mean, give me a break.

151
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,500
Why we gotta carry
all this crap by ourselves?

152
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,708
It's Christmas.

153
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,208
The restaurants are
busy enough as it is.

154
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,125
Cut 'em some slack.

155
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,750
Quit acting so entitled.

156
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:08,375
So, uh, what d'you think's
on the menu for us tonight?

157
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,916
Some beef would be awesome.

158
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,833
Another round of cod stew
and imma lose my mind.

159
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,500
Give a girl some steak!
A burger! Anything!

160
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,416
Am I right?

161
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,541
Hey. You're doing it again.

162
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,708
Earth to Sophie.

163
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,416
Yeah, this is
definitely about Andrew.

164
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,375
Will you stop saying that?!

165
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,083
Jeez.

What about it?

00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,791
A nice rib-eye
for the holiday season?

Uh... We're having cod stew.

Really, what else is there?

177
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,416
Still, though.

178
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,416
Every so often...

179

[SOPHIE] I can't shake the
feeling I let something slip.

180
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,000
Something important,
just out of reach.

Sorry, Sophie.

182
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,208
That's my fault.

I'm so sorry!

Not that I can honestly
say I'm surprised.

Hi, darling.

Thanks for waiting!

'S quite a will you have.

It's saying something that not
even Luke's "rain" was enough

00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,458
to wipe the slate clean.

[GINA]
Sure you wanna do this?

220
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,666
That amulet only
kick-started your memory.

221
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,125
It woke up the past.

222
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,583
But there'll be
a world of difference

223
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,625
once the past comes into focus.

Maybe you bit off more
than you can chew.

225

Is Sword alive?

One doesn't vanquish
the Golden Knight.

There's something else I was
hoping you could tell me.

[GINA]
Hmm?

239
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,416
Makai Alchemists.

00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,250
How do I become one of them?

Listen.

I know you erased
my memories to protect me.

I get it.

244

It hurt worse than anything.

245
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,458
I... I could still feel them.

246
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,958
All the things I'd done.

247
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,416
My experiences.

248
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,750
They were...

249

They were there.

250

Part of me knew they were real.

251
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,666
[SOPHIE] I have no idea
what I'm capable of.

252
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,250
Maybe this it stupid.

Who knows?

254
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,750
But if there's even a chance

255
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:59,750
I could protect someone the
way you guys protected me.

256
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,166
Then I can honor
my brother's memory.

257
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,208
Martin can live through
the people I help.

One day,
I'll be strong enough.

I promise you that.

Sword in the eye.
