00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,500
Ha!

162
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,166
What the hell is wrong with you?

163
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,125
She's a bit more troublesome
than you expected, eh?

164
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,375
So this how you
stay in shape?

165
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,541
No wonder Horrors don't
stand a chance against you,

166
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,583
you're a beast!

167
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:19,166
Yeah, that's not
really how it works.

168
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,833
This supposed to
be you? Too cute.

169
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,166
Yeah.

170
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,875
I'm guessing you
have a younger sibling?

171
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,916
They must really look up to you.

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,541
Sister actually.

173
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,333
So how come the two of you
don't live in the same place?

174
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,250
She's a little too far away.

175
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,833
Like El Dorado?

176
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,291
'Fraid not.

177
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,708
Oh, I, uh...

178
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,791
Welp, you know where I live now.

179
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,666
Let's get you home.

180
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,375
I didn't mean to be rude.

181
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,208
Sorry for just showing up.

182
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,375
[SWORD]
No worries.

183
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,000
Hey, have you eaten?

184
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,166
I'll make some pot stickers.

185
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,666
Like a to-go order?

186
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,750
Yes, please! The others
would love some!

Daddy, wait!

191
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:44,458
[WOMAN B]
I just... I just really...

192
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,500
...wanted to see you.

193
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,583
[WAITRESS]
Thanks for waiting.

194
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,500
Huh. People disappearing
at a theater.

195
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,750
[WAITRESS]
Welcome-welcome!

196
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,875
What? I thought that
was an online hoax.

197
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,000
[SOPHIE]
Mornin', Sword!

198
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,083
Mind if I join you guys?

199
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,416
Sophie, I'm in the
middle of somethin'.

200
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,291
[SOPHIE]
Oh, my bad.

201
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,833
I prefer to take care
of this one on my own.

202
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,375
Why?

203
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,125
[LUKE] You've got enough on
your hands playing babysitter.

204
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,000
See ya.

205
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,791
Uh. Hey!

206
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,375
Where's he get off
callin' me a ba--?

207
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,958
One adult. Enjoy the show.

208
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:21,708
Sorry, sir. This is
a smoke-free theater.

209
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,208
It's my third time here.

210
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,750
[WOMAN C]
Really? Huh?

211
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,541
What's with the
popcorn? Is it free?

212
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,333
[MAN D] Did I tell you?
This place is amazing!

213
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,000
[LUKE] Let's hope it's not
sitting in the audience.

214
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,958
I need a clear shot.

215
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,416
[FLOORMAN A]
Hey, uh, movie's over, pal.

216
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,416
There's no post-credit scene.

217
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,541
[LUKE] Guess I need to look
at the staff schedule,

218
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,958
and the box office record.

219
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,791
I'll have to make this
a proper stakeout.

220
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,708
[STAFF B]
Sophie! Where's that sesame oil?

00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,000

Right! <i>Hao de</i> !

226
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,208
[MEIFANG] That tiny girl is
worth ten of you. At least.

227
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,000
[SWORD] You don't have
to say it like that.

228
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,000
Hey, Sophie! Take a five!

[MAN E]
Yeah, I know, right?

231
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,000
Problem is he doesn't
have the first clue.

232
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,291
Evidently your
friend doesn't know

233
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,166
what is meant by
"curiosity killed the cat."

234
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,583
She's a tough cookie, all right.

235
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,208
Poor Luke, though.

236
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,208
Word is he's having a hard
time on the theater job.

237
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,875
Not that he's told me anything.

238
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,000
Makai Alchemists are
a stubborn bunch.

239
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,958
Particularly the capable ones.

240
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,041
Reminds me a lot
of you, honestly.

241
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,583
Hogwash. When have
I been stubborn?

242
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,458
Um, only every
second of every day.

243
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:02,708
Isn't that movie theater the
topic of heated debate online?

244
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,333
Yeah, I suppose.

245
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,291
Seems to me it's
worth delving into

246
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,208
if Luke's more direct
approach isn't bearing fruit.

247
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,416
As the saying goes, there's no
wave where there's no wind.

248
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,625
[SOPHIE]
I could do some research.

249
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:14,833
[BOTH]
Huh?

250
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,833
[SOPHIE] I need you guys'
help with a rumor

251
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,291
that's been making the rounds.

252
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,166
Couples go to this theater,
but one of 'em vanishes?

253
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,750
[SCHOOLGIRL AVATAR A]
<i>Oui</i> . I've heard of this.

254
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,541
It came up on a thread
about urban legends.

255
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,041
[DEER AVATAR A]
It's just couples who are into

256
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:36,166
that sort of thing who are
makin' a big deal out it.

257
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,625
[GIRAFFE AVATAR A]
The story I heard was that

258
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,791
people who sit next
to each other in row L

259
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,875
are destined to be
together forever.

260
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,125
[SOPHIE]
Row L?

261
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,291
[DEER AVATAR A]
Do you know how many theaters

262
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,875
with row L there are?

263
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,208
[RABBIT AVATAR A] Does that have
anything to do with the rumor

264
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,583
that seat 13 is haunted?

265
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,750
[DEER AVATAR A]
Again, do you know

266
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,458
how many "seat 13s" there are?

267
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:52,833
LOL.

268
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,083
[SCHOOLGIRL AVATAR A]
According to what I've read,

269
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,583
the disappearances all
happen at late showings.

[SWORD grunts]

Common denominator's
a specific seat,

273
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,416
based on what I've found.

274
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,666
Specific seat?

275
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,666
Some of the legends
are romantic.

276
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,750
Most of 'em fall into the
"creepypasta" territory.

277
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:18,125
But they all talk
about row L, seat 13.

There's gotta be
something to it.

Wait, Sword.

it's directly in front of us.

Say what now?

you're done for today.

But, Mother--

how hard her boy is working.

normal theater to me.

[ZARUBA] The barrier is
powerful, but unstable.

313
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,458
I'd have never caught on
to the Horror's presence

314
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,041
so quickly otherwise.

Something's caused
a fluctuation.

Luke, most likely.

317

[ZARUBA] There must be
a point of communication.

00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,416
An opening through
which it feeds.

319
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,291
[SOPHIE] Common denominator's
a specific seat.

320
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,125
They all talk about
row L, seat 13.

321
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,375
There's gotta be
something to it.

322
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,458
[SWORD]
Say, "Ah"!

323
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,000
I gotcha.

324
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,500
[ADELAIDE]
Luke! No more!

325
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:41,208
[LUKE] But... giving up's
a sign of weakness.

326
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:45,125
There's no shame in gathering
your strength. Be patient.

327
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:48,000
Not every battle can be
won the first time out.

328
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,458
Remember that.

329
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,375
Gather my strength.

330
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,708
[ADELAIDE]
Yes.

331
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,583
Now let's go home and
get a decent night's rest.

332
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,541
Clear you mind.

333
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,458
There's no need to think
on it till tomorrow.

334
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,166
Yes, ma'am.

335
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,875
[SWORD]
Luke!

336
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,083
Wake up, you moron!

337
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,333
It's a trap! Think about it!

338
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,000
Your mother?

339
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,541
[LUKE]
Huh? What about her?

340
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,375
Snap out of it, she's dead!

341
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,666
She died right in front of you!

342
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,958
[HORROR A roars]

343
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,875
Nice goin', man.

344
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,416
[LUKE]
Thanks. I owe you one.

345
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,833
Oh, stop. It's not like I did
this for you to be in my debt.

346
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,666
I just like having you around.

347
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,375
Guess that makes me
the sentimental type.

348
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,375
[LUKE]
Can we not, please?

349
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,250
Typical.

350
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,000
Whoa there, cowboy.

351
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,000
I didn't do it on
my own, so you know.

352
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,416
Sophie's the one who found you.

353
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,208
If you owe anybody anything,
far as I'm concerned, it's her.
