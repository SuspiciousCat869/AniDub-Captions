329
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,625
[LUKE] I'll leave the city
in your capable hands.

330
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,041
Will you now?

331
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,625
You are kind, but I may be
a bit too old for this.

332
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,125
[LUKE] Age just means
you're more qualified.

333
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,708
[FEI LONG] Heh. We have
your mother to thank

334
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,500
for that razor-sharp wit.

335
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,958
It can't be helped.

336
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,500
We'll do our best.

337
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,125
[LUKE]
I'd expect nothing less.

338
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,625
Hey, no slacking off, y'hear?

339
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,250
[LUKE]
I was wondering...

340
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,416
Meifang.

341
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,583
[MEIFANG]
Hm?

342
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,208
[MEIFANG]
Ready?!

343
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,583
Here I come!

344
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,916
[LUKE]
Ready.
