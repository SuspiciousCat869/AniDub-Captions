1
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:21,583
How sure are you?

2
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,250
Very. See for yourself.

3
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,458
Here's the thing, though.

4
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,166
I have to go back to
the Land of Guidance.

5
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,166
Yesterday's attack obliterated
by weapons inventory.

6
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,666
I can't be empty-handed.

7
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,791
I'll meet up with
you guys in El Dorado.

8
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,250
Oh wow.

9
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,166
We made it.

10
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,916
I s'pose they like to
keep security fairly tight.

11
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,083
[SWORD]
Huh.

12
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,666
It's a lot cleaner inside
than I thought it'd be.

13
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,250
This work for you?

14
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,666
Let me add my own touch.

15
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,291
So is this where
we're planning to stay?

16
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,791
Yep.

17
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:37,125
It's good a have a base of
operations in enemy territory.

18
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,291
[SOPHIE]
Whoa!

19
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,208
Lookit!

20
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,750
Everything's so shiny!

21
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,333
It's beautiful!

22
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,416
Somewhere out there,
my brother's waiting.

23
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,041
[LUKE] Reassure me
you know what to do here.

24
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,916
Find out who this King is.

25
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,166
It's what the Watchdog
Center ordered, right?

26
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,000
No problem.

27
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,458
I mean, how hard can it be?

28
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,625
Yeah, kinda wish
Gina hadn't taken a detour.

29
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,125
Just sayin'.

30
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,375
[SWORD]
Hmm?

31
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,083
What's the matter?

32
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,500
Why so somber all of a sudden?

33
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,250
It's bad to bottle things up.

34
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,791
The body doesn't like it.

35
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,166
Hell, 'f you need to take
a leak, the thing to do is--

36
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,916
[SOPHIE]
Shut up!

37
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,916
Why you always
gotta be such a jerk?

38
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,166
Could we go over
the plan again, please?

39
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,041
Ugh!

40
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,291
[SWORD]
Fits perfect.

41
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,958
Oh, yeah the plan!

42
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:52,625
Right! We're gonna gussy
ourselves up and explore!

43
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,458
[SWORD]
You gotta be kidding!

44
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,916
Well, hello there, pretty boy.

45
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Wanna get an eyeful
of these boobies?

46
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,666
Give thanks for this bounty!

47
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,500
Uh...

48
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,875
[LUKE]
Interesting.

49
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,833
Everything here is made
by the GarEden Corporation.

50
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,125
[SWORD]
GarEden?

51
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,125
[LUKE]
There.

52
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,583
[SOPHIE]
Huh...

53
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,125
Oh, you don't say.

54
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:28,875
Whoa!

55
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,583
Something just popped up
right in front of me!

56
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,875
This is incredible!

57
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,000
[laughs]

58
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,583
[SOPHIE]
How is he not sad?

59
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,791
[SWORD]
Thank you for this bounty.

60
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:40,083
[SOPHIE] Zaruba called him...
his partner.

61
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,291
For most people,

62
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,833
sadness is part of how
they honor the dead.

63
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,291
That's not true for us.

64
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,708
[LUKE] We see our
duty through to the end.

65
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,583
It's how we vindicate
those who've fallen.

66
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,333
I don't understand.

67
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,375
Think about it.

68
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,416
What's your purpose
in coming here?

69
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,541
What are you talking about?

70
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,333
I wanna find my brother.

71
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,500
[LUKE]
Is that all?

72
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,291
Huh?

73
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:11,000
[DARK KNIGHT] My master
is the King of El Dorado.

74
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,708
You have been summoned.

75
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,583
[SWORD]
Hey!

76
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,583
This is where we're eating,
just so you know.

77
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,458
Get a move on!

78
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,666
They're here.

79
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,708
Yeah.

80
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,041
[SWORD]
Not just one or two either.

81
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,583
Should I know what
you're talking about?

82
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,916
[SWORD]
Horrors.

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,250
Holy crap! For real?

84
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,958
Wha?

85
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,958
I have a feeling they didn't
congregate here naturally.

86
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,041
Yeah. Land of Guidance
said somethin' like that.

87
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,750
This King guy has
the power to control them.

88
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,000
Might even be this
whole city's run by Horrors

89
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,583
under his command.

90
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,750
Odd that Bishop and the
others haven't made a move yet.

91
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,458
[LUKE] There's more to
El Dorado than meets the eye.

92
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,625
[SWORD]
Definitely.

93
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,208
[SOPHIE]
Hm.

94
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,125
I think it's about time we did
a little covert reconnaissance.

95
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,458
Leave it to me.

96
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,500
I'll get online and
dig up something we can use.

97
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,041
Who knows?

98
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,625
With any luck I'll point us
in the direction of my brother.

99
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,333
Huh?

100
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,041
[SWORD]
You'll find him.

101
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,708
No way you won't.

102
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,291
I concur. That's why we're here.

103
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,833
Well, well,

104
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,666
looks like your aim's not
the only thing that's improved!

105
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,291
Don't start.

106
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,916
[SWORD]
I say we ask around first.

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,750
[SOPHIE]
Sure.

108
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,125
But, what about Luke?

109
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,625
He's sorta got his
own way of doing things.

110
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,208
No kidding.

111
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,791
How 'bout I find
a network to log into

112
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,250
so I can do what I do best?

113
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,000
[SOPHIE]
Hmm?

114
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,416
Somethin' wrong?

115
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,625
No.

116
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,166
Not exactly.

117
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,333
But...

118
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,666
Hey, let's go
check that thing out.

119
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,791
[SOPHIE groans]

120
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,291
What's up?

121
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:12,375
Well, El Dorado has its
own proprietary network.

122
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:16,041
Basically it means the only way
to connect is through ELDO NET.

123
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:16,958
Yeah.

124
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,208
Makes sense.

125
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,375
Why not give it a try?

126
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,958
And, uh...

127
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,208
Speaking of proprietary.

128
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,333
Thank you for this bounty.

129
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,416
Pervert.

130
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,416
[laughs]

131
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,208
Now go work your magic.

132
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,208
Hello, ladies.

133
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,583
How we doin' this fine evening?

134
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,708
[WOMAN B]
Hey, big guy.

135
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,708
[SWORD]
Not interrupting anything, am I?

136
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:37,791
Okay.

137
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,583
Is this it?

138
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,291
[VOICE] You have successfully
connected to ELDO NET.

139
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,833
Ew! Cold!

140
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,000
Huh? Huh?!

141
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,666
This is amazing!

142
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,666
I can totally feel everything!

143
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,208
Oh wow!
I can even smell the air!

144
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,416
[SOPHIE]
Ouch.

145
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,291
[SOPHIE]
Huh? It smells so good!

146
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:30,833
And tastes even better!

147
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,375
Wait. What? How is this a thing?

148
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,583
[CANDY MAN]
Hey, what are you doing?

149
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,916
You must be new around here.

150
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,958
[SOPHIE]
Um. What's...?

151
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,541
Sorta overwhelming
your first time, huh?

152
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,333
They recreate
all five of your senses!

153
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,125
[SEAL] Once the
beta test phase is over,

154
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,166
the El Dorado System
will be ready for rollout.

155
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,458
And available
to the entire world!

156
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,458
They're taking it global?

157
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,625
Come along, noob!

158
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,250
Let me introduce you
to some of my pals!

159
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,166
Uh. Hang on a second, please!

160
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,833
There's something important
I need to ask you about first!

161
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,541
Have you heard anything
about I don't know...

162
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,916
...people mysteriously
vanishing?

163
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,750
Maybe someone you knew,
or you've heard rumors, or...

164
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,541
[laughter]

165
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,875
Slow down!

166

Why you gotta turns things
dark all of a sudden?

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,708
You won't make
any friends in ELDO

168

if you hit 'em with that kinda
talk right out of the gate!

169
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,291
If a few people
disappear, so what?

170
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,791
[SOPHIE]
Weird attitude to have.

I don't get this place.

176
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,583
Guess it just throws me off that
everyone here seems so happy.

177
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,666
They're happy
'cause they're open-minded,

178

That's how this
wonderful city works.

181

You can call it
El Dorado's guiding light.

182
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,958
[ALAN] Why are you so
interested in missing persons?

00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,958
Well, I...

184
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,916
You wouldn't happen to
know the Golden Knight,

185
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,208
now would you?

186
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,875
Huh?

187
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,208
Actually...

188
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,583
Uh?

189
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,125
They come here in droves.

190
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:43,416
And regularly,
judging from these levels.

[SOPHIE]
What are those markings about?

sure Horrors like to hang out.

Well, here I am.

[ALAN] It's good of you
to come, Golden Knight.

210
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,291
I've been waiting a long time.

211

[SWORD]
You work for GarEden?

[ALAN]
Used to.

00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,041
I left.

What is it you wanna
talk to me about, exactly?

215

Why be all cloak
and dagger about askin'?

216
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,625
I didn't want those
monsters to find me.

217
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,541
Had to take certain precautions.

Wait, so you know about 'em?

Cafeteria?

People have absolutely no idea.

225
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,333
The GarEden corporation
is behind it all.

00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,583

How's that?

Everything.

231
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,375
Top to bottom,
GarEden is calling the shots.

232
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,541
All to one purpose.

233
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:01,041
[SWORD]
To provide a feeding ground.

Every public figure

The mayor, the chief of police,
even the comptroller.

 Monsters, the lot of 'em!

That's one hell of a Utopia.

238

So, how'd you find all this out?

239
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,125
[ALAN] My curiosity
got the better of me.

240
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,833
I came across a data
server locked down

241
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:22,791
under some unusually
heavy protection.

242
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,833
I couldn't resist hacking
my way in and having a peek.

00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,125
Wish I hadn't.

244
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,208
When I broke through.

245
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,083
You found surveillance video of
slaughterhouses like this one.

246
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,916
Yeah, though I regret to say
that wasn't the only thing.

247
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,708
Go on, we're listening.

248
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,958

I received a message.

249
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:56,083
[ALAN] In that email, was
the ugly truth about El Dorado.

250
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,375
[ALAN]
And a warning.

251
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,833
That the corporation knew what
I'd seen and was coming for me.

252
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:06,041
If I valued my life,
I had to run.

253
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,125
Since then,

254
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:10,333
I've been hiding here
like an animal.

255

[LUKE] I'm guessing the message
is how you found out about us?

[ALAN]
Yes.

257
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,791
It said there was a man

258
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,125
a Golden Knight.

259
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,375
Yeah, but how'd they
even know about us?

260
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,916
Who sent you the email?

261
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
[ALAN]
I have no idea.

All I know is he
called himself "Sword."

What?

264
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,291
[LUKE, SOPHIE]
Hmm?

00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,208
Don't look at me!

found yielded more information.

[ALAN] Namely, that there's
a secret organization

00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,958
Second floor, eleven o'clock!

327
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:32,916
What is happening?

328
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,875
Excellent work!

329
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,333
Look, don't worry 'bout
payin' me back, all right?

330
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,208
That isn't an option!

331
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,500
Looks like we're in the clear.

332
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:31,750
Yeah.

333
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,625
What's this?

334
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:41,708
[SOPHIE gasps]

335
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,416
Martin?

336
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,958
[ALAN]
You know the guy?

337
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:45,833
[SOPHIE]
Yes!

338
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,625
He's my brother!

339
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:49,916
Wait, just a second.

340
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,166
You're telling me

341
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,541
you're actually
Martin Hennes' little sister?

342
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,291
How do you know you he is?

343
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,958
[ALAN]
Hennes is the programmer!

344
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,458
The one I was telling you
about from the data search.

345
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,250
You can't be serious.

346
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,541
[ALAN] Yeah, this
is a dock for workers.

347
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,208
I think this ought'a get me out
of here in one piece.

348
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,000
Go to Twelfth Street.

349
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,666
There's a bike,
west of the slums.

350
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,333
Take it.

351
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,958
'S all yours.

352
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,000
Even comes with a barrier.

353
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,250
The roads won't be a problem.

354
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,625
[ALAN]
Thank you.

355
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,916
When you're in Russell City,
look for Fei Long's.

356
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,125
Best authentic Chinese in town.

357
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,708
Gal who helps run the place can
be a bit of spitfire, but hell,

358
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,833
it's more 'n worth puttin' up
with for those fried dumplings.

359
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,333
I can't begin
to thank you enough.

360
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,166
I'm afraid I only ever
spoke to Martin once,

361
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,041
so I can't really pretend
I know that much.

362
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,458
But I know one thing.

363
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,250
He did say his little sister
made him proud.

364
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,666
So, guess what I heard?

365
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,333
Somebody really came through
for us, didn't they now?

366
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,166
Hey!

367
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,416
Don't treat me like a child!

368
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,291
But you are a child!

369
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,708
How did you know
where the Horrors were?

370
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,625
Oh, yeah.

371
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,125
Some little girl
told me where to look.

372
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,000
Some little girl?

373
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,250
[SOPHIE]
Uh-huh.

374
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,583
Think she has something

375
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:23,208
to do with the email
supposedly written by Sword?

376
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,000
[SWORD]
What is going on?
