1
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:16,916
[WAITRESS]
Still no sign of him.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,500
Aw! But he always comes here!
Where could he be?

3
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,500
[WAITRESS] I appreciate
your persistence,

4
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:25,208
but I'm not psychic.

5
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,208
Whatever. I'll look
for him myself.

6
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,333
Would you care to
look at the menu?

7
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,125
There's the avocado
cheddar sandwich.

8
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,583
Hot and sweet hash browns.

9
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,416
And our brand new
three-fruit smoothie

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,500
with double the toppings!

11
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,208
Hmmm-mmm!

12
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,500
Available for a limited time.
Highly recommended.

13
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,250
Uh-oh! Sorry, sweetie.

14
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,458
House rules. If you can't
pay, you can't stay.

15
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:57,000
Shucks! Thanks for stoppin'
by, hon. Toodle-loo!

16
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,291
[SOPHIE]
Please?

17
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,708
[SISTER]
No!

18
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,541
You've been given your
allowance for the month.

19
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,000
Learn to budget yourself.

20
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,916
Whatever luxury you
think you need can wait.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,041
It's not about luxury!

22
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,125
Why on earth must you
frequent a restaurant

23
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,791
when we feed you here?

24
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:53,250
If that's not luxury,
I don't know what is!

25
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:02,250
[SISTER]
Is life with us so unbearable?

26
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,375
My dear, I realize
you're doing all this

27
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,458
for your brother Martin.

28
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,833
Why not be patient and let
the police do their job?

29
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:15,708
Unless they know what El Dorado
means, what can the cops do?

30
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:16,916
What?

31
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,458
[SOPHIE]
Never mind.

32
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,416
[ANNE]
What'cha doin', Sophie?

33
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,208
[SOPHIE]
I dunno. Nothin'.

34
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,125
Hey. You even started
writing your essay yet?

35
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,500
Deadline's soon.

36
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,750
Like, day after tomorrow soon.

37
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,583
[SOPHIE] I need to know
if anyone saw it

38
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,791
with their own eyes.

39
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,375
[LIP AVATAR A]
No idea.

40
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,416
[POODLE AVATAR A] What, did you
get ripped off or something?

41
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,166
[SOPHIE] No. I'm just
looking into a rumor.

42
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,541
[OWL AVATAR A]
What's the rumor?

43
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,333
[SOPHIE]
There's a man in golden armor.

44
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,041
He's connected to a string of
people who've gone missing.

45
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,541
At least, that's the story.

46
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,833
[OWL AVATAR A]
<i>C'est quoi</i> ?

47
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,750
[MONKEY AVATAR A] This the first
I heard about this rumor.

48
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,000
[SOPHIE]
He calls himself a Makai Knight.

49
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,208
[LIP AVATAR A]
Sounds like a mental case.

50
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,541
[POODLE AVATAR A]
Mmm... try asking around

51
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,750
on the occult thread.

52
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,708
[SOPHIE]
Wait, there've been incidents.

53
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,333
[ANNE]
Hello? Sophie?

54
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,208
[gasps]

55
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,625
Gee, thanks.
Way to pay attention.

56
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,208
[SOPHIE]
Hm?

57
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,125
I said the essay's due
the day after tomorrow.

58
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,416
The nuns are gonna blow a
fuse if you forget, for real.

59
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,041
Crap. They seriously
want it that soon?

60
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,375
Consider yourself warned.

61
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,875
Hey, do you remember
Father Ripley

62
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,625
who performed mass
for us that one time?

63
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,583
He was super nice?

64
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,416
[SOPHIE]
Kind of, I guess.

65
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,416
[ANNE]
Well, I heard he disappeared.

66
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,916
Disappeared?

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,458
[ANNE] Yeah. They were talking
about it in the cafeteria.

68
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,000
No one knows where he is.

69
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,875
But they say at night
from his house,

70
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,500
you can hear this
sinister voice.

71
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,250
How creepy is that?

72
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,791
I can't sleep by myself anymore.

73
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,125
It's like something out
of a horror movie.

74
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,041
[knocking]

75
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,750
[SISTER]
I'm coming in.

76
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,166
[SISTER]
Where's Sophie?

77
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,458
[ANNE]
Curled up on the--

78
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,625
[gasps]

79
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,250
[SISTER]
Unbelievable.

80
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,625
[SOPHIE] There might be
a Horror behind this.

81
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,541
Just like with the
Moon Wizard guy.

82
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,041
Which means Sword
will get involved.

83
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,791
Just keep heading up
the road a bit further.

84
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:53,958
Yeah, nice fella.

85
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,916
He and Miss Marie
were always so sweet.

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,708
Fixed up an old
church and everything.

87
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,125
Miss Marie, you said?

88
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,375
[OLD MAN A]
Father Ripley's little sister.

89
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,541
Now there's a gal who turned
a few heads in her day.

90
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,583
She's a bit of a recluse now.

91
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,708
Doesn't show her face
around town much anymore.

92
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,666
You'd never find a man more
devout than her brother, though.

93
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,166
The priesthood was his calling.

94
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,375
[LITTLE GIRL A giggling]

95
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,541
--[LITTLE GIRL A] Over here!
--[BOY A] Be careful!

96
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,208
--'Scuse me, I'm sorry.
--[BOY A] Sorry about that.

97
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,583
[SOPHIE]
How did you pay for this?

98
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,416
[MARTIN] The reward money
from my programming competition.

99
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,250
It's huge!

100
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,375
[MARTIN]
Yup. And all yours.

101
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,416
The whole thing's mine?

102
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,541
[MARTIN] Sophie. It's
special now, I know.

103
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,333
But one day you'll be
able to eat this stuff

104
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,166
whenever you feel like it.

105
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,625
--[BOY A] Keep up, sis!
--[LITTLE GIRL A] Hey! Wait up!

106
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,125
[SOPHIE]
Um, pardon me.

107
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,541
Who're you?

108
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,708
Uh. Sorry for just showing up.

109
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,875
[SOPHIE] Hi there, my
name is Sophia Hennes.

110
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,208
I'm from the Catherine
Home in Russell City.

111
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,583
Father Ripley did mass
for us a while back.

112
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,708
You're, uh, Miss
Marie, aren't you?

113
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,750
As a matter of fact, yes.

114
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,500
Pleasure to meet you.

115
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:49,208
I, um, thought... maybe
we could talk, or...?

116
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:52,041
Yes, that'd be lovely.
Come on in.

117
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,291
Okay!

118
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,875
[SOPHIE]
He just up and vanished?

119
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,208
[MARIE]
Yes.

120
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:04,625
The reality of it still
hasn't quite sunk in.

121
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,083
What do the police say?

122
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,625
Nothing very comforting,
I'm afraid.

123
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,000
I get the impression
that there are

124
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,375
quite a few cases like Tom's.

125
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,625
The detective warned me
not to hold out much hope.

126
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,125
What a jerk.

127
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,625
I mean, seriously.

128
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,041
Where do they get off
talking to people like that?

129
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,833
They don't know what it's like!

130
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,666
And you do?

131
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,958
[SOPHIE] My brother's been
missing for a while now.

132
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,166
I'm looking for him.

133
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,333
[MARIE] Oh, dear.
I'm sorry to hear that.

134
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,000
[MARIE]
You poor thing.

135
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:42,083
Hey, uh, you haven't been
eating well lately, right?

136
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,708
Here you go.

137
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,875
Thank you very much.

138
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,541
It's delicious!

139
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,625
Glad you like it!

140
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:58,750
You think it's good now,

141
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,833
wait till we let it
simmer for a bit.

142
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,375
Hey, neat-o!

143
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,541
Look at that. Do you dry
those flowers yourself?

144
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,666
[MARIE] I sure do.
Something of a hobby of mine.

145
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,083
I pick fresh ones every morning

146
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,291
and dry them right
here in the kitchen.

147
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,333
Helps pass the time.

148
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,916
Cheers the house a
bit, too, I think.

149
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Whoa. They're all
over the place.

150
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:25,083
Oh, wow. Is that you
in the picture? Cool.

151
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,500
[MARIE]
Oh. Ancient history.

152
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,750
That was taken at the
town festival ages ago.

153
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,041
[SOPHIE]
You were a knockout!

154
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,333
[MARIE]
Don't look too closely, now.

155
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,750
Aw, come on.

156
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,625
You're still just as beautiful
as you were back then.

157
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,458
Throw on some nice
clothes. Get out there.

158
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,666
You'd be the belle of the ball!

159
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,666
Uh, I'm sorry, Sophia.
That ship sailed long ago.

160
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,375
[banging]

161
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,958
Wait, I'll get it for you.

162
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,458
Coming!

163
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,875
[gasps]

164
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,250
[SOPHIE]
Sword?

165
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,666
What the hell are you
doin' here, kid?

166
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,958
Um, excuse me?

167
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,416
Back up. I happen
to have a name.

168
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,916
Don't you dare've forgotten!

169
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,791
Ugh. I've been looking
for you, ya know!

170
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:27,791
Uh.

171
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,541
Yeah. Sure, fine.

172
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,083
So, why are you here? Snooping?

173
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,125
Curious about the
Father Ripley case?

174
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:34,833
[SWORD]
Huh?

175
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:38,000
What? Ugh. Sword! C'mon!

176
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,666
You and I both know a Horror's
gotta be involved somehow!

177
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,458
What's that s'posed to mean?

178
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,291
All right, honestly?

179
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:48,250
Word is, the man's younger
sister is quite a catch.

180
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,000
You've gotta be kidding me.

181
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:50,916
[MARIE]
Who is it?

182
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,125
Oh, uh.

183
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,041
Do you two know each other?

184
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,416
Well, actually.

185
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,208
[SWORD] Ah! You must be
the famed Miss Marie!

186
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,291
Yo, get lost, huh?

187
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,833
I can't believe you're
trying to-- Hey!

188
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,875
It's a pleasure to meet
you. Sword's the name.

189
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,250
My condolences.

190
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:10,083
I'm sorry to hear about your
brother's disappearance.

191
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,375
Such a shame.

192
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,125
Feel free to lean on
me whenever you need.

193
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:18,458
Single woman, living alone...
I imagine it must be difficult.

194
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,750
If you ever need any help
around the house or anything,

195
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,333
I'm you're man.

196
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,166
Here, these're for you.

197
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,083
Thank you, sir.

198
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,166
Alrighty, then.

199
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,458
Sweet.

200
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,041
Excuse me?

201
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:41,208
See? I only dropped
by to say hello.

202
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,375
Now, run along home
before it gets dark.

203
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,583
Uh. Yeah.

204
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,375
Behave yourself.

205
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:55,375
[SOPHIE gasps]

206
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,833
Ugh! What is wrong with me?

207
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,416
Wait here. I'll be
back in a second!

208
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,166
[bell tolls]

209
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,666
Marie.

210
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,708
[SOPHIE] Where d'you
think you're going?

211
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,333
You can't just walk away!

212
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,750
I need to know
what El Dorado is!

213
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:45,208
Good grief. You're
like a mosquito.

214
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,750
Thing is--

215
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,791
Oh. Hey, Miss Marie.

216
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,916
[SOPHIE]
Hey!

217
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,625
Later days!

218
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,875
[ZARUBA] That little spitfire
is nothing if not determined.

219
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,083
[SWORD]
Yeah, well,

220
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,250
she's throwin' a monkey
wrench into my plan.

221
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,208
Looks as though you'll have
to speed things up a notch.

222
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,875
Yeah, I know.

223
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,916
[MARIE humming]

224
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,583
[SOPHIE]
Sorry about that.

225
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,750
Took a little longer
than I thought it would.

226
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,541
Hope you weren't
worried or anything.

227
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,166
[MARIE]
Perfectly all right.

228
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,291
You figure things
out with your friend?

229
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,750
[SOPHIE]
Meh.

230
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:41,375
One way or another I'm gonna
have a talk with that man.

231
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,083
You put 'em in water.

232
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,500
Of course.

233
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,541
Awfully nice of him to bring
them, don't you think?

234
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:50,041
Say, Sophia, would
you stay for dinner?

235
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,375
Sure! Wow, someone's
in high spirits!

236
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,916
Oh? Yes, I suppose I am.

237
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:00,750
[SOPHIE sighs]

238
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,375
[SOPHIE]
You're a good cook.

239
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,625
Is it rude of me
to ask for seconds?

240
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,875
Oh, my goodness, you
must've been starving.

241
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,458
[SOPHIE chuckles]

242
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,166
I have to be careful when I eat
'cause it makes me kinda sleepy.

243
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,166
Stay the night, then.
I have an extra bed.

244
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,625
[SOPHIE]
Uh.

245
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,166
[MARIE]
Oh, that's right.

246
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,625
The nuns must be
wondering where you are.

247
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,125
Prob'ly.

248
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,500
You should get home
before too long.

249
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,166
This was our quiet hour.

250
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,166
Breaking bread together,
my dear brother and I.

251
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,333
He preferred to take a
shower right after dinner,

252
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,583
then fall asleep reading a book.

253
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,875
I'd always find him conked
out with the lights still on.

254
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,708
For years it was my nightly
ritual to switch them off.

255
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,500
It's odd being just me.

256
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,500
Not sure what to do all alone.

257
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,708
[SOPHIE]
I know how you feel.

258
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,250
Huh?

259
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,666
When I was a kid,

260
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,291
I couldn't fall asleep unless
I knew where Martin was.

261
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,000
That's your brother?

262
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,500
I needed him.

263
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,666
I was afraid of the dark,
but it was fine if he was there.

264
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,791
[MARTIN]
What's so scary?

265
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:10,041
I just don't like being
by myself at night.

266
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,583
It's too quiet. Makes me feel
like I'm the only person here.

267
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:14,750
[MARTIN]
Huh.

268
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,000
Hey! What's that?

269
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,208
[MARTIN]
Hi! I'm your bear buddy!

270
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:23,666
[SOPHIE gasps]

271
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,333
Cute!

272
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,666
There, see? You've got
nothing to be scared of.

273
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,750
I'm here, right?

274
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,875
[MARIE] Your brother
seems exceptionally kind.

275
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,750
You were lucky to have him.

276
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,875
[SOPHIE]
Um, yeah.

277
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,375
I know. We were inseparable.

278
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,666
He's the one who taught
me about computers.

279
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,875
Really?

280
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,750
I remember Father
Ripley being nice.

281
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,458
Yes, um. He was. Very.

282
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:59,416
In fact, I dare say, my Tom used
to treat me like a princess.

283
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,916
Beautiful. That's what
he used to call me.

284
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,250
Said I was simply too
beautiful for this world.

285
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,333
Sounds like he was
super proud of you.

286
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:15,333
That's why he always forbade
me from leaving the house.

287
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:18,583
Why I was never allowed to
wear a proper lady's dress.

288
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,000
Why he never let
me speak to men.

289
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,500
You... You're hurting me. Stop.

290
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,875
Let go!

291
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,375
[SOPHIE]
What are you doing?

292
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,958
Stop it!

293
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,583
Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

294
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,250
I... You wouldn't--

295
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,625
[MARIE]
It was all my brother's fault.

296
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,541
[MARIE]
He was jealous.

297
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,666
Because of him,
I couldn't even...

298
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,791
[SOPHIE]
M-Marie.

299
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,416
You don't understand because
you're still so young.

300
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,166
The world's your oyster.

301
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,583
Stop! Stay where you are!

302
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,416
I will die a lonely and
shriveled old crone,

303
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,250
trapped in this house!

304
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,375
[SOPHIE]
Help!

305
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,125
[MARIE]
He did this to me.

306
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,250
[gasps]

307
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,500
[gasps]

308
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,000
[creak]

309
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,791
Look at me! You did this!

310
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:52,250
[MARIE]
You turned me into this thing!

311
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:05,625
[MARIE] I want to eat your
future. Give it to me!

312
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:06,833
[SOPHIE]
No!

313
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,666
[SOPHIE]
You-You came back!

314
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:20,083
Idiot. I tried to
warn you, damn it!

315
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,375
Want me to spell it out for ya?

316
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,500
The priest went missing
'cause his sister devoured him!

317
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,666
Stay here! Don't move!

318
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,625
I've gotta help him.

319
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,333
[yells]

320
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,666
[screams]

321
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,958
That was really dumb.

322
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,250
[SOPHIE]
Don't go!

323
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,291
You can't just leave. Not yet.

324
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,375
Tell me what El Dorado is!

325
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,750
[SWORD]
Damn it, girl.

326
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,833
Why are you so obsessed with it?

327
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,458
[SOPHIE] My brother fell off
the face of the Earth.

328
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,208
I... I think a Horror took him.

329
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,916
[SOPHIE]
What's that about?

330
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,666
And if his disappearance
has anything to do

331
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,750
with these creatures,
whatever they are,

332
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,833
then I need the help
of someone like you!

333
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:57,291
I'm begging you, Sword!
Please help me find my brother!

334
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,583
[SWORD] First things first.
What's his name?

335
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,750
[SOPHIE]
It's Martin. Martin Hennes.

336
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,041
[SWORD]
Hop on.

337
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,166
Let's go get us some tacos.
