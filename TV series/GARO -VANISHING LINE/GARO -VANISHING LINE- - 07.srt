Now where do you think
you're going?

Sir, I don't know who you are,

00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,541
but you won't lay a
hand on my children.

Mr. Brooks! Please!
You've gotta let us in!

There's a crazy man!
He's inside the house!

00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,333
Call the police!

What are you doing?

337
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,583
Get ahold of yourself.

338
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,500
You've gotta say calm.
