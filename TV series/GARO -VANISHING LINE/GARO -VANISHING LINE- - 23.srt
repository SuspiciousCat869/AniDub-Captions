1
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,291
How much further we have to go?

2
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:20,708
[LIZZY]
About seven hundred meters.

3
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,416
It's on the other side
of that wall.

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,416
Okay, hold on!

5
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:33,875
We're doin' this
the old-fashioned way!

6
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,916
[SOPHIE shrieks]

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,541
[LIZZY] I'm forcing a link
to the main server.

8
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,541
Connection's good.

9
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:41,958
We're in!

10
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,916
Worse ways to make
an entrance 'f you ask me.

11
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,958
Um...

12
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,666
Okay.

13
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,958
What is this?

14
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,208
[LIZZY]
The King's sovereign domain.

15
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,916
He sustains himself
by devouring lost souls.

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,666
This is where he feeds.

17
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,458
It's about to become
the hill he dies on.

18
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,500
Just be careful.

19
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,916
I'll lead Sophie
to the storage unit.

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,666
You ready?

21
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,666
[SOPHIE]
Huh?

22
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,291
Heads up!

23
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,125
[DARK KNIGHT laughs]

24
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,208
I see your attack
style is maturing.

25
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,625
And yet, it's all for nothing!

26
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,166
Hope you like what
I got on the agenda, sweetheart.

27
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:36,291
Yeah, 'fraid you won't be
getting to Sword anytime soon.

28
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,916
[LIZZY]
Watch out.

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,333
Both of you are logged into
the system body and soul,

30
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,375
which means you're vulnerable.

31
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,916
[SWORD]
Body and soul?

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,125
[LIZZY]
Yes.

33
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,458
Think of it as a
backchannel that allows you

34
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,791
to go full out as
a Makai Knight.

35
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,208
The tradeoff?

36
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,875
I'm no longer your gatekeeper
to the physical world.

37
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:57,041
I had to forfeit that
talent to get you here.

38
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,000
[SWORD] Then I'll be
damned if we waste it!

39
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:00,750
Go on.

40
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,875
Just take care of Sophie

41
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:03,708
She's safe.

42
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,250
Count on it.

43
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,500
[SOPHIE]
Hey, um...

44
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,375
Not sure how to ask you this
without sounding awkward.

45
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,375
Yes. I'm his little sister.

46
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,333
Look, I have no idea what
he's told you about me,

47
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,875
but not even Sword
knows the whole story.

48
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:31,000
For now, let's just focus
on saving the world, huh?

49
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,625
You're the only one who
can deactivate ELDO NET.

50
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,125
That's quite a thing.

51
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,583
But don't worry.

52
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm here for you.

53
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,833
Lizzy's got your back!

54
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,083
[SOPHIE]
Thanks.

55
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,750
We're here.

56
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,041
The access terminal
that connects

57
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,291
to the main storage unit.

58
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,791
Deep breath.

59
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,541
[DARK KNIGHT]
Not as skilled shooting up close

60
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,791
and personal, are you?

61
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,000
The past still has
a hold over you.

62
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,750
It severely limits
your ability to focus.

63
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,875
[LUKE] I will not break ties
with where I come from.

64
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,750
I refuse.

65
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,750
Despite your philosophy.

66
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,041
That's not weakness!

67
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,041
[LIZZY] This might be tricky,
so prepare yourself.

68
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,333
[SOPHIE]
'Kay, what do I do?

69
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,083
[LIZZY] Only two people have
system admin privileges,

70
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:34,000
Martin Hennes,
obviously, and you.

71
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,333
Jump on and access
the main terminal.

72
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,791
Figure out the
deactivation password.

73
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,166
What's happening?

74
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,083
[SOPHIE gasps]

75
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,291
[SWORD]
The Hell?

76
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,666
[KING]
Beware.

77
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,375
Here you are no more than food.

78
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,166
Here will you eternally
sate my hunger,

79
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,541
as mankind has done
since time out of mind.

80
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:22,083
Embrace the darkness
and know everlasting peace.

81
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:26,791
In the void with in me,
all things become as one.

82
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:32,333
[KING] Let die the
excoriating light and succumb.

83
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,041
[SOPHIE]
I-I don't understand.

84
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,333
[LIZZY] It's the
King's security protocol.

85
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,000
The ancient one's
decided to show himself.

86
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,625
[BISHOP] Translation:
Your noble attempt is at an end.

87
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:45,458
Sorry.

88
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,208
Good evening, ladies.

89
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:50,125
I wonder if you'd like
to play a little game?

90
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,291
Oh-ho...!

91
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,833
You'll never
land a decisive blow.

92
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,041
Your edge is too dull!

93
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:40,833
You've got some nice moves.

94
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,208
I'll give you that.

95
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,041
But I'm not losing
to a fallen Alchemist!

96
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,916
[KING]
So predictable.

97
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,250
Mankind never changes.

98
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,458
Struggling.

99
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,708
Rejecting annihilation.

100
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,916
No matter the era.

101
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,791
Again and again
I crush you underfoot,

102
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:53,250
yet you scuttle back with
the tenacity of roaches.

103
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,833
Lizzy.

104
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,000
What are you doing?

105
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:14,875
Sophie!

106
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:15,958
Back away!

107
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,750
Now! You'll be absorbed
into the system!

108
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:22,000
[BISHOP] Some people just
don't know when to quit.

109
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,125
Your friend has lost
this one, my dear.

110
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,875
The Golden Knight is
officially extinguished.

111
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,333
Sophie!

112
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,875
[SOPHIE]
I don't believe you.

113
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,541
Sword doesn't have it
in him to lose!

114
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:38,083
Because he's the strongest
Makai Knight who's ever lived!

115
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,375
[KING]
There is no longer anyone

116
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,583
who can lay a hand
on this sacrosanct realm.

117
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,666
All obstacles have been removed.

118
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,666
Supernal tranquility
shall flow unobstructed.

119
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,750
[SWORD]
What are you, a damn thesaurus?

120
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:55,500
Why do bad guys
always monologue?

121
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,625
Huh? How is this possible?

122
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,083
[SWORD]
Clichéd reaction.

123
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,541
Let's just say life
is complicated.

124
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,458
[SWORD]
On the one hand,

125
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,125
it hurts like an
absolute son of a bitch.

126
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,708
I wouldn't go so
far as to call it ugly,

127
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,250
but it sure knows
how to make a face.

128
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,458
On the opposite
end of the spectrum,

129
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,000
life is beautiful.

130
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:23,541
Champagne, roses, the whole bit.

131
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:27,083
In the middle,
there's the wild card.

132
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,541
A little thing called hope.

133
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,416
That's where we come in.

134
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:35,958
[SWORD]
See.

135
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:39,208
Pain is what makes the job hard.

136
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,541
[SWORD]
But hope?

137
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,875
That's what makes
the job mean something.

138
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,625
[SWORD]
I'm no stranger to darkness.

139
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,291
I just don't give it
the last word.

140
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,708
'S what it means
to be a Makai Knight.

141
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,500
What it means
to be one who protects.

142
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:07,791
Golden Knight Garo!

143
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,500
[KING]
Fascinating.

144
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,791
Let us see how you
fare after I've destroyed

145
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,083
your capacity for hope!

146
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,375
[LUKE]
Do what you want with me.

147
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,000
I won't let you go.

148
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:38,250
Even if my body crumbles to ash,
you will never reach him!

149
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,833
Well done!

150
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:52,708
[gasps]

151
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,083
Wait a second.

152
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,083
Sophie!

153
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:58,916
We need to go!

154
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,333
Right!

155
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,625
Good bye, my King.

156
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,541
Come on.

157
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,250
Get your ass back here.

158
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:57,583
[ZARUBA]
Sword!

159
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,416
These are just pieces of data!

160
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,083
There's no end to them!

161
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,333
[SWORD] Then we go
straight for the source!

162
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,791
[SWORD]
Ugh! Damn it!

163
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:37,625
[KING]
Futile.

164
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,125
This world and I
are one and the same.

165
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,291
You cannot vanquish me.

166

[SWORD]
Then I guess it looks like

167
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,833
I have to take out
an entire world!

168

Ready!

Here!

171
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,250
Use this!

172
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,041
[SWORD]
Yes!

173
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,708
Let's do it!

[SWORD roars]

It can't be.

00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,791
Garo.

177
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,458
Huh? Well. What's this now?

178
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,750
King's disappeared.

179
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,583
Incredible!

Sophie!

181
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,250
There's only one way
to save your brother!

182
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,916
You have to destroy
the storage unit!

183
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,416
I... I don't want
anyone else to die.

184
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,125
Help me.

185
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,958
Give me strength.

186
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,750
Whatever you've got!

187
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:27,916
This is for Sword!

188
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,083
Please! Help me protect him!

Don't cry, Sophie.

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,666
I'm always gonna be
right here beside you.

Martin.

194
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,208
[MARTIN]
Sorry.

195
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,666
I, uh...

196
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,875
I did kind of crappy job
keeping my promise.

197
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,375
[SOPHIE]
Don't say that!

198
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,375
It's not true!

199
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,625
You did everything you could!

200
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:19,208
At the end of the day
all of this was for me!

201
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,291
I know it.

202
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,083
I have the best
brother in the world!

203
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,458
You just wanted me
to smile again.

204
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,333
You're right.

205
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,291
Yeah.

206
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,625
That's it.

207
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,333
That's everything.

208
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:33,250
Well, here you go, then.

Are you hurt?

Talk to me, please!

Thank you, Martin.

Thank you.

216

Huh?

217
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,458
Honestly.

218
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,416
This is the path you've
chosen for yourself?

219
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,458
I wouldn't expect
you to understand.

220
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,375
You've done it, Sophie.

221
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,416
ELDO NET is no more.

222
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,375
Guess this is my exit.

223
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,541
Do me a favor if it's
not too much trouble.

224

Take care of him.

Sure.

Thanks.

Oh, and if you can, tell the
big lug it wouldn't kill him

do I have to tell you?
