1
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,125
[ELDER]
You've completed your trial

2
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:39,500
for the Land of Guidance, I see.

3
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:40,500
[LUKE]
Yes.

4
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm bound for El Dorado.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,250
[ELDER]
Before you embark,

6
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,375
there is a place I'd very
much like you to visit.

7
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:50,375
A small settlement, where a
Horror has lain sealed away

8
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:52,250
for ages untold.

9
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,291
[LUKE]
Hm.

10
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,833
You don't say.

11
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,000
The seal's power is diminishing.

12
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,958
Quite soon the
Horror shall awaken.

13
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,708
[LUKE]
I have my own path to follow.

14
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,791
I'm aware, and I
understand this would be

15
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:07,958
a detour on your
journey to El Dorado.

16
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,416
However.

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,666
It may prove to be a
shortcut for you personally.

18
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,916
Ah...!

19
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,208
Um, is there something
I can help you with, sir?

20
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,250
[LUKE]
The pattern on the door.

21
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,083
Huh?! You're here!

22
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,541
[LUKE]
Sorry?

23
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,750
[STELLA] You do know what
that mark means, don't you?

24
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,000
[LUKE]
It's a bit dated,

25
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,250
but definitely made by
a Makai Alchemist.

26
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:00,750
Oh, I uh, yes well,
w-why don't you come in?

27
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,666
Yeah, yeah. Who is it, then?

28
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:14,916
Bastard!

29
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,375
What in the hell have you
done to my granddaughter?

30
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,958
It's not like that, Grandpa.

31
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,416
This man's a potential customer.

32
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,541
[sighs]

33
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,125
Should'a said that
'stead of letting me

34
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,375
stand here barkin'
at the poor guy.

35
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,666
I was on the verge of thrashing
him within an inch of his life!

36
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,958
[LUKE] The Land of
Guidance brought me here.

37
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,500
Oh. Well, please, come in.

38
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,458
So, uh...

39
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,625
Would it be too much for me
to ask what your name is?

40
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,375
[LUKE]
Luke.

41
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,916
[STELLA]
Mr. Luke. Cool.

42
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,541
I'll just come right out with
it: you're the Demon Sealer!

43
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:54,958
[LUKE]
The what?

44
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,375
The one foretold of in
legend who will save this land!

45
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,375
[LUKE]
No, I'm not.

46
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,958
W-What are you talking about?

47
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,083
Surely, you are!

48
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:01,916
[LUKE]
Nope.

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,250
Wait a second,

50
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,166
then how did you recognize
the mark on our door?

51
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,291
[LUKE]
I know things.

52
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,875
This "Demon Sealer"
isn't one of them.

53
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,541
You're kidding me.

54
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:15,208
[LUKE] So I take it you
two aren't on our side?

55
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,291
Well it depends.

56
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,916
Exactly what side is that?

57
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,208
[LUKE]
Forgive the intrusion.

58
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,916
No! Wait, please, I wanna
show you something!

59
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,666
Here, take a look.

60
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,958
This book used to belong to
my grandfather's grandfather.

61
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,333
[LUKE]
A Makai Knight.

62
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,625
What kind of knight?

63
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,708
So you do know
something about this!

64
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:40,916
[LUKE]
Let me guess.

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,958
This is a rendering
of your Demon Sealer.

66
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,125
[STELLA] "Demons lurk in
the dark places of the world,

67
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,375
yet there are those possessed
of the power to seal them."

68
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,625
According to this book,

69
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,666
a demon was sealed
away here a long time ago.

70
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,041
[ELDER]
A small settlement,

71
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,750
where a Horror has lain
sealed away for ages untold.

72
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:02,541
[STELLA] "When the demon stirs,
the Demon Sealer shall appear."

73
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,541
Here's the thing,
unpack the text a little

74
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,458
and it's abundantly
clear all this lines up

75
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,875
with the next full moon.

76
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,333
That's tomorrow night.

77
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,416
[ELDER]
The seal's power is diminishing.

78
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,791
Quite soon the
Horror shall awaken.

79
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,625
You have to admit,
someone like you just showing up

80
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,791
out of nowhere has got to
be more than coincidence.

81
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,708
[LUKE] Where precisely
is this "demon" of yours

82
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,875
meant to be sealed?

83
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,416
I'm afraid we don't know.

84
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,375
And believe me, we've been
turning the whole settlement

85
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,791
upside down looking for it.

86
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,166
The design on this armor's
been bothering me, too.

87
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,125
I mean, look at it.

88
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,250
Half the getup's painted black.

89
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,625
Do Demon Sealers...

90
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,000
Sorry, what'd you call them?

91
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,416
Makai Knights?

92
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,000
Is this what they wear?

93
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,000
'Cause really the only
thing we know for sure

94
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,458
is that this image resembles
a statue that used to stand

95
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,791
on the outskirts of town
way back in the day.

96
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:51,791
[LUKE]
Oh yeah?

97
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,666
It was destroyed
in an earthquake.

98
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,500
The only trace
of it now is the base.

99
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,041
It's real, though.

100
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,333
Grandpa saw it with his own
eyes when he was a little boy.

101
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,541
More of a toddler, actually,

102
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,958
but I can vouch
for its existence.

103
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,125
[LUKE]
Indeed.

104
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,333
Can you take me there?

105
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,750
Yes! Of course!

106
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:09,666
You heard the gentleman!

107
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,958
Let's take him sight-seeing!

108
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,125
Come on, now.

109
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:12,875
Wheelchair.

110
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:13,791
Get a move on!

111
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,958
[ALEC]
All right. Don't push.

112
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:19,041
I'm not as young as
I used to be, sweetheart. Easy.

113
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,750
Can I ask you
a question, Mr. Luke?

114
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,875
This Land of Guidance
you mentioned earlier?

115
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,500
What's that about?

116
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,916
[LUKE]
Can't say.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,083
Is it a town? Or ruins?

118
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,166
Maybe some kind
of secret cavern?

119
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:37,958
Wait, I know!

120
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,833
It's Outer Space!

121
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,083
[OLD LADY A]
Stella!

122
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,458
Really? A stranger?

123
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,083
How many does this make now?

124
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,958
Hey! He isn't just anybody!

125
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,500
As a matter of fact--

126
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,000
We've told you time and again
these vagabonds are trouble!

127
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,625
Ha! And you!
Don't you have more self-respect

128
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,916
than to feed a young girl's
delusion, shifty-eyed, huckster?

129
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,791
Huh? What's a huckster?

130
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,125
Take it from me, young lady,

131
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,833
you can't trust a man just
because he's handsome.

132
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,708
I'll bet this Lothario
has broken more hearts

133
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,875
than he can be
bothered to count.

134
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:07,958
Lothario?

135
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,916
[LUKE]
A groundless accusation.

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,041
He, um, he says you're wrong.

137
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,416
So it's okay!

138
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,000
Trust me, there's absolutely
nothing to worry about

139
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,250
from this one!

140
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,666
What in the world are
we going to do with you?

141
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,541
You can't be this naïve!

142
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,666
I'm not naïve.

143
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,416
Mr. Luke's the real deal!

144
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,750
Grandpa agrees with me.

145
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,250
[ALEC]
Hey! Hey! Ahh!

146
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,208
Grandpa!

147
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,833
This is where it used to be.

148
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,041
[LUKE] And it looked like
the picture in your book?

149
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:57,750
[ALEC]
Yup.

150
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,083
Stood there for ages.

151
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,583
Though I have to confess:
something feels off.

152
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,250
[LUKE]
Meaning what?

153
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,041
He said the same thing
last time we were here

154
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,791
when I tried standing on it.

155
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,583
We couldn't quite figure out
what the problem was, though.

156
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,625
Hop over there and
try posing on the base for me

157
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,208
if you wouldn't mind, sir.

158
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,250
Seeing you do it might clear
the cobwebs and jog my memory.

159
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,666
You think so?

160
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,500
[LUKE] I don't see how
that'd make any difference.

161
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,875
What? For starters,
you're way taller!

162
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,083
[LUKE]
I refuse.

163
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,541
Well! You definitely look
more imposing than Stella!

164
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,958
[LUKE]
Please hurry.

165
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,833
[ALEC] He stood more
or less as you are now,

166
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,666
only his arm was out
holding his sword.

167
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,875
Well lookie there.

168
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,208
Stella's got someone
else along for the ride!

169
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,958
Where did you find this guy?

170
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,416
[BOY C]
Check out the look on his face!

171
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,791
He's so into it!

172
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:51,916
Scary!

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,125
Don't pay
attention to 'em, Mr. Luke.

174
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,125
You look super cool.

175
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:56,833
What'cha think?

176
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:57,958
Got anything yet?

177
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:58,875
I don't know.

178
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,333
Something still seems off.

179
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,541
[gasps]

180
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,583
[LUKE]
Are we done yet?

181
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,333
Wait! That's it! Of course!

182
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,583
The design.

183
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,916
It's not intentional.

184
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,291
It's just shadow!

185
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,625
[LUKE]
What?

186
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,750
[STELLA] Grandpa, you said
people used to observe

187
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,166
a special time for prayer,
isn't that right?

188
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,000
Yeah, sure. At high noon.

189
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,916
Which is right about now.

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,166
That means the shadows

191
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,375
would fall in a specific
pattern on the armor.

192
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,583
Would you mind facing the
opposite direction for a moment?

193
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:49,708
[ALEC]
Ah-ha!

194
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:50,833
There it is!

195
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,666
That makes perfect sense!

196
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,458
The view behind the statue
would be completely different!

197
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,916
Something wrong?

198
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,541
Not the place
I would've thought.

199
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,208
[LUKE]
The seal.

200
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,625
Amazing.

201
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,166
[STELLA]
Whoa!

202
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,458
[LUKE]
This is it.

203
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,375
This is where it was sealed.

204
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,833
[pants]

205
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,500
Um, are you feeling all right?

206
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:09,083
'Kay, so the demon's true form
is something called a "Horror?"

207
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,583
[LUKE]
Correct.

208
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,958
It feeds on humans by first
exploiting a person's greed

209
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,375
and possessing them.

210
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,958
Those sworn to protect mankind
from these creatures--

211
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,958
Are what you
called Makai Knights?

212
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:19,875
[LUKE]
Yes.

213
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,250
The Horror sealed here,

214
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,541
however, was a knight
who fell to a Horror's sway.

215
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,583
Really?

216
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,916
[LUKE] Everyday,
we must be prepared

217
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,875
to face the darkness head on.

218
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,916
When confronted with the enemy,

219
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,291
our hearts can
ill afford to waver.

220
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,708
Lest in the blink of an eye
we be utterly consumed.

221
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,083
Quite good.

222
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,083
You really mean that?

223
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,791
You're not just
trying to be nice?

224
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,916
Quit fishing.

225
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,458
Not to brag, but uh,

226
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,958
cooking is the one thing
where I'm above average.

227
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,750
She has quite the talent for it.

228
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:04,125
Bit of a shame, her mind
always seems to be elsewhere.

229
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,208
Oh. By the way, Mr. Luke,
I've been meaning to ask you

230
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,041
where you keep
your sword and armor.

231
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,708
It so happens I possess neither.

232
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,416
Huh? But I thought you--!

233
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,916
You mistake me for a knight.

234
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,583
Oh. But, uh, I mean,
you can still defeat it.

235
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm obliged to try.

236
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,500
I'm the only one here.

237
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:22,833
There's no other choice.

238
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,083
Yeah, well, you'll do great!

239
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,208
You've got me!

240
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,125
I'll be there to help
the whole time!

241
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,500
That won't be necessary.

242
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,000
Oh-ho!

243
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,416
I'll have to whip up some
demon-warding supplies, won't I?

244
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,291
[ALEC]
Spare a moment?

245
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,541
All right.

246
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,583
[ALEC]
She's a good kid.

247
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:52,750
Always has been.

248
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,166
Never thinks twice
about putting a complete

249
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,000
and total stranger's
needs ahead of her own.

250
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,750
Her mother and father
travel a lot for work.

251
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,500
They're not around
for most of the year.

252
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,458
Not that she complains.

253
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:10,958
I told her an old legend
to keep her occupied, you see.

254
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:14,291
Moved on from there
to all sorts of kooky stuff.

255
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,833
We had fun.

256
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:16,541
Mythology.

257
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,458
Urban legends.

258
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,375
UFOs.

259
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,708
Cryptozoology.

260
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,125
You name it,
she obsessed over it.

261
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:26,000
Before long, she became our
resident expert in the occult.

262
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,875
Not for tea parties and
playing dress up, that one.

263
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,041
'Bout half a year ago I'd say,

264
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,333
she dug that old
book out of storage,

265
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,250
poured through
it cover to cover.

266
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,291
Got fixated on the idea
we were all in harm's way.

267
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,958
Started asking every traveller
who passed through town

268
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,875
if they were the Demon
Sealer she'd read about

269
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,208
and would they help us?

270
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,791
Struck me as good a way as any

271
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,458
for a lonely little girl
to pass the time.

272
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,916
Imagine my shock when I learn
the old legends might be true.

273
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,708
So you believe
the stories after all.

274
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,041
I do.

275
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,916
And I can't shake
the feeling I've involved

276
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,791
my poor granddaughter
in something unspeakable.

277
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,791
You have nothing to worry about.

278
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,416
I'll see to it she's
not involved.

279
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,291
[ALEC]
Thank you.

280
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,291
That puts me at ease.

281
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,333
What do you mean he's gone?

282
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,708
Why didn't you wake me?!

283
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,750
[ALEC]
He wanted me to tell you thanks.

284
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,208
I have to go!

285
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,125
[ALEC]
No, you don't!

286
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:21,916
Think about it!

287
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,583
What could you possibly--?

288
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,875
He left you behind,
so you wouldn't get in his way!

289
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:27,750
[STELLA]
That's insane!

290
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,083
He doesn't even have a sword!

291
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,333
Please! Whatever the man's
reasons for going alone,

292
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,666
we have to respect them!

293
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,416
Stella, you don't
have to go with--

294
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Do you even care what'll
happen to this town?

295
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,750
[ALEC]
No!

296
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,958
All I give a damn about
is what happens to you.

297
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,833
But, Grandpa, you...

298
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,208
[ALEC]
Please.

299
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,125
Leave things to him.

300
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:40,083
[LUKE]
I probably only have one chance.

301
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,000
He's strong!

302
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,500
I-I didn't mean
to do that, um...

303
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,833
I was just gonna watch,

304
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,500
but then it looked like
you were in trouble, so...

305
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,708
[LUKE]
Get back!

306
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,250
[LUKE]
I will protect you.

307
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,583
That's a promise!

308
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,583
[LUKE] I don't doubt
you were once a knight

309
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,791
to be reckoned with.

310
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:29,958
Did the terrible weight of your
obligations lead you astray?

311
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:34,916
[LUKE]
No.

312
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,583
You faltered in a
moment of weakness

313
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,666
and lost sight of those
you were meant to protect.

314
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,125
You let yourself be consumed!

315
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,375
You mistook your purpose.

316
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,625
You neglected your heart!

317
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,541
[LUKE]
We may fall in the line of duty,

318
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,500
but the hope we represent?

319
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,125
That takes on
a life all its own.

320
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,666
[LUKE]
I see it now.

321
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,750
I know what true strength is!

322
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,958
Unsung warriors.

323
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,916
I inherit your will!

324
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,708
Thank you both.

325
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,083
Take care of yourself.

326
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,125
I swear I'll never forget
you as long as I live!

327
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,458
Now, now, Stella darling.

328
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,833
Crying your eyes out's
no way to send him off.

329
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,666
Your story, I'll pass it on!

330
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,208
Mr. Luke the Mighty!

331
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,625
That's sweet,
but I'd rather you didn't.

332
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:22,875
Huh? Wh-What are you doing?

333
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,791
It's for the best that
you never come to our side.

334
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,583
I don't understand.

335
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,041
Huh?

336
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,666
[LUKE]
Farewell.

337
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,666
[STELLA gasps]

338
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,250
What happened?

339
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,416
Okay.

340
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,916
I get myself mixed up
in something again?

341
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,791
Huh?

342
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,750
The full moon's already passed?

343
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,375
Totally slipped my noticed.

344
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,500
You believe that?

345
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,291
Good god,
I hope I'm not going senile.

346
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,333
What about the Demon Sealer?

347
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,250
Did he show up?

348
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,958
Not that I saw.
Nothing really happened.

349
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,291
[STELLA sighs]

350
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,708
Stella?

351
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,375
I'm just relieved
everyone is safe.

352
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,958
It was just an old
superstition after all.
