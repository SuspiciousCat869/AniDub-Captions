Doctor Stanley, my friend!

00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,625
How goes the work?

00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:33,708
[DR. STANLEY]
Quite well.

5
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,500
My control simulations suggest

00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:38,625
the fusion experiment's
objective is in sight.

[BISHOP laughs]

00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,666
Don't go too easy
on the tests, now.

We want this stage to
be an extravagant one!

'tween us and El Dorado.

You need gas?

No need to worry about me.

You're the one who looks

Huh?

Aw, c'mon.

Sorry.

I'm just trying to get Sword
to pay attention for once.

of that real quick.

Eh!

without even bothering
to ask if it was okay.

Typical MO.

I know, right?

28
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,583
What's worse is that
it was the stuff I got

29
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,833
from Ferre Salé Dessimo,
which is like, rare or whatever!

30
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,875
And I didn't just get
it for myself, either.

31
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,416
It was for us three to share!

32
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,875
Ugh. Is there a worse
crime in existence?

Hey! Don't be sarcastic!

[SOPHIE]
Wow.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,833
Not really what I was expecting.

Miiyaaahh!

40
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:49,166
What? You weren't hoping for
paradise this far out, were you?

41
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,041
It'll only get bleaker
the further we go.

42
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,208
This is probably the closest
thing we'll have to a rest stop

43
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,833
before El Dorado, so I advise
you to gird your loins.

[SWORD] Stay here overnight,
head out at dawn?

Sounds like a plan.

Cool?

Gimme a break.

How long are you
gonna stay pissed off?

49
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,458
You ate my chocolate
without asking.

Ugh, look,
I told I'm sorry, a'right?

That's just it, though:
you're not!

You pulled the same
thing the other day

when you drank
the last of my juice!

keeps everybody awake,

[GINA]
It's just for one night.

175
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,500
He's more than capable
of handling himself.

176
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,125
I acted like
such a brat, though.

177
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,500
He's probably sick of me.

178
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:08,250
I didn't mean to say
all that stuff, I just.

We're all tired, sweetheart,

[SOPHIE sighs]

00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,166
Still, though,

182
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,125
I wouldn't blame him
for abandoning me.

183

Sword?

184
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,375
Abandon you?

185
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,791
Not a chance.

this is for him, right?

Don't worry too much, okay?

I can personally guarantee you
he'll be there when we leave.

00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,916
Hey, I think somebody
could use a pedicure.

Yes!

[PEDRO chuckles]
I'm sorry.

Didn't mean to make
a scene back there.

Sit down, please.

199
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,250

[PEDRO]
That's Monica.

202
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,250
[PEDRO] My future never
looked all that bright.

203
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,333
But as long as she was
with me, things were good.

204
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,875
Last year, she was murdered.

205
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,500
In this town, Gordon
and his gang call the shots.

206
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,291
All the girls here have to be...

207
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:37,125
Gordon thinks of them
as his property.

208
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,083
Bastard.

209
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,375
I'm just gonna come right
out and say it.

210
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,583
I wanna take him down,
and I'm gonna need your help.

211
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,208
Look, I swear,
all you need to worry about

212
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,166
is distracting his guys.

213
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,041
I'll worry about their jefe.

214
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,000
You're just going
to wind up dead.

215
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,416
So what--I don't care!

216
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,708
I'll die happy knowing
I killed the son of a bitch!

217
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:00,833
No, seriously.

218
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,250
I am serious!

219
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,833
I've got nothing, look at me.

220
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,958
If I die, no one gives a damn.

221
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,625
Monica was my whole world.

222
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,625
Without her there's
no reason to live!

223
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,500
Listen to yourself.

224
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,916
You think that's how Monica
would want you to go out?

225
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,916
Oh. Callate!

226
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,208
She's not here!

227
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,166
Who knows what
the hell she'd want?

228
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,833
I wanna finish this!

229
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,250
I will finish this!

230
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:47,000
When Lizzy died I felt
the exact same way you do.

231
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,458
[gasps]

232
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,833
A world without her in it
had no place for me either.

233
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,000
The thought of facing the future
alone was like stepping up

234
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,125
to the edge of an abyss.

235
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,666
Thing is...

236
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,875
There's no one left to remember
her if I let myself die.

237
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,125
Huh?

238
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,916
Yeah. That's right.

239
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,416
It's all up to me.

240
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,958
I have a responsibility
to keep her memory alive.

241
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,333
But how can I just...

242
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,500
I don't have to
listen to you, man!

243
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,750
You don't even know me.

244
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:21,875
I didn't...

245
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,375
I didn't expect you
to help me anyway.

246
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,291
Deep down, you're just a coward!

247
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,083

Sorry.

[SHOP OWNER] We have evidence
that strongly suggests Horrors

251
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:47,125
were involved in the massive
explosion at Cygnusram-Tech.

252

Sadly, our database
was unsalvageable.

The only piece of
information recovered

254
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,416
was the as yet unknown
term: El Dorado.

Needless to say, your training
will proceed as planned.

about your sister.

research facility, wasn't it?

[ONLOOKER B] Yeah. Part of
Cygnusram-Tech, apparently.

260

The fire came out of nowhere.

I've never seen
anything so awful!

262
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,166
[ONLOOKER C] Worst part is
there was a school next door.

263
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,416

the middle of class.

pure distilled hatred.

Do you complain
this much at the gym?

272

I thought you were
trying to bulk up?

273
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,458
No pain, no gain.

274

Isn't that the mantra?

275
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,250
Well, extend it to eating
vegetables and stop whining.

276
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,166
It's an acquired taste.

Ah. Yeah!

328
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,083
Sure!

329
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,375
Let's leave this town together!

330
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,333
Getting out of here
won't be cheap, you know.

331
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,458
Then we'd better
start saving our money.

332
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,541
Okay.

333
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,041
We'll have to work very hard.

334
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:42,833
But yeah,

335
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,125
I think we have a chance!

336
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,250
Come on, think positive!

337
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,166
A chance?

338
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,750
There's nothing to it!

339
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,291
Yeah!

340
00:19:56,083 --> 00:20:08,083
[sobs]

341
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,666
Monica!

342
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,166
Oh god!

343
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,958
Monica!

344
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,833
[GORDON pants]

345
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,708
I don't know what that's about,
and I don't want to!

346
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,958
[SOPHIE]
Um, I, uh...

347
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,708
Yeah, so...

348
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,916
Yesterday, I-- Well I, uh...

349
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,083
Look, it's on me.

350
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,833
I shouldn't've made
that stupid comment.

351
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,333
Huh?! Wha? Oh...

352
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:58,083
It isn't the same kind, but...

353

[GINA chcukles]

354
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,833
You were late because
you stopped to buy chocolate?

355
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,000
Um, sure.

356
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,250
I guess so.

357
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:11,750
Wait!

358
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,208
It didn't come like that!

359
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,541
[GINA] Then what happened
to it on the way here?

360
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:16,541
[SWORD]
Just stuff!

361
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,333
You know!

362
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,250
[GINA]
Really?

363
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,958
I love it!

364
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,458
This way it's easier to share!

365
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:23,750
Have some!

366
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,583
After all, we must
enjoy life to the fullest!

367
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,208
Words of wisdom.

368
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,541
You're the best Sword, thanks!

369
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,041
[SWORD]
Hey, it's the least I could do.

370
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,916
[laughs]

371
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,500
Myaah...

372
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,625
Mya!

[gasps]

374
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:43,666
Huh? What is going on?

375
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,750
Mi-mi-mi-mi!

Myah!
