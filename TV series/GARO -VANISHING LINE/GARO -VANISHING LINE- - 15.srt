A perfect plan?

inching his way closer.

botched her kidnapping.

I wouldn't say that.

No, as a reconnaissance effort
it was quite invaluable.

there is no room for error.

00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,541
They're trying to... Oh, god!

170
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,875
Sorry, hon. Can't.

171
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,000
[CAROL]
Huh?

172
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,500
Who are you?

173
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,166
[BEZEL]
Huh.

174
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,166
No King here, I see.

175
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,708
That's a shame.

176
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,041
[MC]
Why do you care?

177
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,041
[BEZEL] 'Cause I'm
more fit for the top slot

178
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:42,291
than some decrepit old hack
and I want him to know it.

179
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,375
[laughs]

180
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,041
You've got a sense of humor.

181
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,083
But you also got
in the way of our meal!

182
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,583
This place smells like a toilet.

183
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,458
That stench should be
eliminated at its source.

184
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,500
Anyone who lords over this shit
show of nobodies has no right

185
00:13:58,583 --> 00:13:59,916
to call himself king.

186
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,791
Not in front of a man
with my qualifications.

187
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,416
[laughs]

188
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,458
[BISHOP] The cafeteria
in District 32 is down.

189
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:18,500
Our visitor's strength, I think,
more than speaks for itself.

190
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,125
You have some nerve.

191
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,541
Feigning ignorance.

192
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,000
You've known his
strength since his arrival.

193
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,541
True.

194
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,833
But I needed a proper chance
to get a lock on his methods.

195
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,000
Where might I ask is Knight?

196
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,541
I thought it'd be best for him
to handle this personally.

197
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,791
Well?

198
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,333
I believe infiltrators
are your responsibility.

199
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,041
Handle it yourself.

200
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:47,000
[BISHOP] Even if our friend's
primary target is His Majesty?

201
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,375
Damned cur.

202
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,250
You are such
a disgusting creature.

203
00:14:56,333 --> 00:15:00,458
Coming from you,
that is a choice compliment.

204
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,416
Oh, dear.

205
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,416
Such a display.

206
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,041
The Man Who Would Be King.

207
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,125
[MC]
Here.

208
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,375
This is the place you want.

209
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,125
[BEZEL]
A barrier.

210
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,541
They don't trust
anyone, do they?

211
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,958
[BEZEL]
It's a good night to die.

212
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,083
The King must not be far.

213
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,458
Bite your tongue.

214
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,791
His name is not to be
uttered by the likes of you.

215
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,000
Now, now.

216
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,500
I'd wield that ring
better than he could.

217
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,541
Deny it all you like, but
absolute power over Horrors?

218
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,750
Heh, c'mon.

219
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,125
It's high time he
passed it down the line.

220
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,750
I wouldn't just
conquer some sandbox

221
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,541
in the middle of nowhere.

222
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,875
I'd take the whole continent.

223
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,500
Oh-ho.

224
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,541
Your scent is particularly
overpowering.

225
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:15,666
Adoration?

226
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,291
No, wait,
a fiercely loyal heart.

227
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,125
I like that.

228
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,291
Don't worry, doll.

229
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,041
Once you're mine,
I'll take care of you.

230
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,875
[QUEEN] Folly beyond
all conceivable measure.

231
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,416
I defend him of
my own, free will.

232
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,083
I am no hostage to His Majesty.

233
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:39,416
You smile, yet are not
worthy to anoint his feet.

234
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,833
Is that right?

235
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:44,708
Hah! But I have such
surprises in store!

236
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:02,041
You know, I actually rather
like the smell of flowers.

237
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,458
[BEZEL]
Huh?

238
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,416
[QUEEN] These are of
the carnivorous variety.

239
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,625
My sweet children from Makai.

240
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,625
Insatiable things.

241
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,875
Are these the claws
that dare to scratch my King?

242
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,291
Really?

243
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,916
Are these the legs that
dare trample upon his soil?

244
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,291
Be gone.

245
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,041
[QUEEN] The mouths that
dare befoul his name?

246
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:56,750
The eyes that dare
show a glint of malice?

247
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,083
[QUEEN] Such feeble
impudence I cannot abide.

248
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,750
Hideous wretch.

249
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,500
Shut up!

250
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,500
[BEZEL]
What?

251
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:41,375
Come now, you didn't honestly
think your ploy would work?

252
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,083
[QUEEN laughs]

253
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,708
[BEZEL]
You bitch.

254
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:22,583
There's no way.

255
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,125
It can't be possible.

256
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,625
[ED] What did I say
about the inexperienced?

257
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,916
Around here, those who
are careless get devoured.

258
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,875
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

259
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,458
I'm the one who
takes care of this fair city.

260
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,583
Wait a second.

261
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,958
You're from the damn park!

262
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,166
Fascinating
spectacle you put on.

263
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,625
I admit I couldn't look away.

264
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,625
It's futile.

265
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:48,958
Whatever else you try to do,

266
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,250
you're going
to die in this city.

267
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,375
That's a guarantee.

268
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,875
You lot have only the sense
to want what's in front of you.

269
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:01,333
So very typical of a Horror.

270
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,041
Though as Horrors go,
you're not really my type.

271
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,166
[BISHOP]
What a face.

272
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,000
I don't think I shall ever tire
of seeing that expression.

273
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,208
Oh, killer entrance.

274
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,041
Are you done with
your so-called training?

275
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,750
My goodness.

276
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:52,166
Nothing interests you
but the Golden Knight.

277
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,541
Ah, well.

278
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,958
Too bad for this fellow.

279
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:14,500
As long as I breathe,
no harm shall ever come to you.

280
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,250
Eh. So be it.

281
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:25,083
El Dorado's true worth
is lost on cretins like him.
