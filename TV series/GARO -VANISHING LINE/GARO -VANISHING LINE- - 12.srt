I'm looking for my friend.

00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,875
What do you mean?

319
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,041
I don't understand.

320
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,750
Then listen closely.

321
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,208
After we came here,

322
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,083
I saw this creature
attack a guest.

323
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,583
Gruesome sight to walk
in on, let me tell you.

324
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,500
I was terrified.

325
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,833
[MATTHEW gasping]

326
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,583
[MATTHEW whimpers]

327
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,833
[MATTHEW]
When I saw it,

328
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,208
I thought to myself: why me?

329
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,458
I'm just trying to
run a motel here.

330
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:43,125
How am I supposed to make a
profit when my guests get eaten?

331
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:46,458
But you know what?

332
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,583
It didn't take long for me
to see the potential.

333
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,458
This was manna from heaven.

334
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,333
My shot at finally
turning it all around.

335
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,875
I never belonged here.

336
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,666
Russell City is the
only place for me.

337
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,916
[gasps] Matthew. Stop this.

338
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,083
You've gone insane!

339
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,208
Can't you see what
this means for us?!

340
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,458
This is it! Our once-in-
a-lifetime chance!

341
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:11,250
[HORROR 12A]
Tell me what you wish for.

342
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,333
[gasps]

343
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,166
[HORROR 12A]
What do you desire most?

344
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,416
I have the power
to make it real.

345
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,875
[MATTHEW]
Then...

346
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,833
...I cannot bear to keep
living this way any longer!

347
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,041
Please! Help me!

348
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,500
Let me start over!

349
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,458
Don't let me die out here
in the desert with nothing!

350
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,708
Matthew...

351
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,958
[MATTHEW]
I don't care what it takes!

352
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,750
Let me ride your wave of glory

353
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,875
all the way back
to Russell City!

354
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,166
[MATTHEW screams]

355
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,250
No!

356
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,666
Matthew! No!

357
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,041
No! Please stop!

358
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,958
[SARA gasping]

359
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,125
[whimpers, screams]

360
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,958
Leave it to us.

361
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:16,458
[HORROR 12A growls]

362
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,625
[SARA]
What is this?

363
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,708
What in God's name is going on?

364
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,541
Stay where you are.

365
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,958
[SWORD]
We've got this.

366
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,291
[gasps] Oh, no!

367
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,416
Where's my son?

368
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,250
[HORROR 12A roars]

369
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,375
C'mon, Mom!

370
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,750
Get in!

371
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,458
[HORROR 12A growls]

372
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,250
[HORROR 12A roars]

373
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,833
[SWORD]
Fade away into the darkness!

374
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,875
[HORROR 12A roars]

375
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,125
[SARA cries]

376
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,083
Matthew.

377
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,291
[SARA sobs]
Matthew...

378
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:49,083
[GINA] They don't remember it
as it actually happened.

379
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,500
They think the motel
was hit by a storm.

380
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:55,291
It's sad, Matthew got crushed.

381
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,375
That's all we could do?

382
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,833
We couldn't try to save him?

383
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,583
Once you're possessed
by a Horror,

384
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,166
reverting to your old
self isn't a thing.

385
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,625
You just go on devouring
innocent bystanders.

386
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,583
[GINA]
Let's move.

387
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:20,833
Right.
