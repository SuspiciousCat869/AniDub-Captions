00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:20,916
Hell if I know
what's goin' on, man.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,416
Like I said, it was some
kinda gold lookin' thing.

3
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,291
Why would I be makin'
somethin' like this up?

00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:31,250
[CONSTRUCTION A]
Am I busy? Are you kiddin'?

5
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:35,625
You can't be that big of
a moron. 'Course I'm busy!

6
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:38,208
Huh? Over on the bridge.

7
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,916
Yeah. That's right. Big.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,041
Like nothin' I ever seen before.

9
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:50,750
Ugh. You gotta do
this right now?

Hang on, it's rainin'.

00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,875
[LUKE] No reason this
should be such a chore.

Anyways... Hold up a sec.

Huh? What were we talkin' about?

14
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:10,083
Look. Sorry, uh,
I gotta go. Later.

15
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:17,666
Okay. I'm overdue
for a vacation.

16
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah. No doubt.
This is Luke's M.O.

So, you like takin'
pictures, eh?

Chillin' with mah boy?

19
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,916
Dumbass. You've been played.

20

Yeah? Well, then prove it!

the money for his treatment,

[LUKE] You're either

[SWORD]
I deserve that.

Why can't it be both?

00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:21,750
[LUKE]
Good point.

48
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,708
[SWORD]
No one's talkin' to you.

[SWORD grumbles]

50
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,416
[LUKE] We're expected
to fulfill our duties

51
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,208
as discretely as possible.

52

Yes or no?

Look, yesterday wasn't
my fault, all right?

54
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,250
[LUKE] Did you or did you
not leave a giant mess?

55
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,916
C'mon! I was takin'
care of a little girl!

Never mind. Stupid it is.

[LUKE]
There was someone with you?

60
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:49,583
Why? Had the enemy
taken a hostage?

61
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,750
Not exactly, no.
'S a special case.

62
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,416
[LUKE] We're not supposed
to get involved with people.

63
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,708
[sighs]

64
00:04:56,791 --> 00:05:00,125
[SWORD] Yeah, well,
that's not how I operate.

65
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,375
Can't protect
somethin' you don't

66

make an effort to understand.

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,333
Am I wrong?

68
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:10,125
Not to be that guy,
but the way you work?

69
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,375
A little heartless, you know?

70
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,291
[WAITRESS] Hiya, fellas.
Hows it goin' over here?

71
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,000
[LUKE]
Not to be that guy,

72
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:26,250
but the way you work
only protects your ego.

73

I heard.

00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,125
Looks like everything's
in good shape now, though.

[SOPHIE]
Yeah.

76
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,458
One of the sisters'll be
here any minute to get you.

77
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,791
Were they upset?

78
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,458
No, no. More relived
than anything else.

79
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,333
Why? Nuns that scary?

00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,541
[SOPHIE]
Nah. Not usually.

81
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:55,000
Talk to me, hon. You really
don't remember anything?

82
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,250
The whole night's a blur?

83
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,291
[SOPHIE] If I have a flashback,
I'll let you know.

84
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,708
Sorry to push. I know
you will, Sophie.

00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,791
Yeah?

87
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,041
Her guardian's come
to take the girl home.

88
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,875
Is she mad?

89
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:33,541
I'm sorry, but it's, um,
it's important I find somebody.

90
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,375
I'll be back by
dinnertime, I promise.

91
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,458
Truth is, with any luck,
this'll help me find out

92
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,833
about my brother.

93
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:44,333
[SISTER] You're aware
what will happen, yes?

94
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,916
If you miss dinner?

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,500
Uh! Ma'am!

96
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,916
Very well, go. I don't
suppose it can be helped.

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,833
[OLD MAN A] Aw. That's
awfully kind of you, miss.

98
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,250
Hey. Maybe...

99
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:00,333
She's not talking to you,
Grandpa. My goodness.

100
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,958
Thank you, Sister!
You're the best!

101
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:05,625

for dinner! Cross my heart!

Sorry.

108
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,875
My fault. I should be
the one saying I'm sorry.

Just be careful.

I'm going from now on!

00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,666
[MAN A] Come on,
let's grab another drink.

162
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,041
I think you've had
more than enough.

163
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:27,708
[HARDY laughing]

164
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,166
[HARDY]
I can run!

165
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,208
I can run again!

166
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,750
Uh, okay, then.
Someone's got issues.

167
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,458
[HARDY]
It's been too long.

168
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,208
[WOMAN B]
Let's get out of here.

169
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,541
[MAN A]
Wait.

170
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,750
I know that guy.
Didn't he win the gold?

171
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,375
[chuckles]

172
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,041
[HARDY] Did it used to
wear me out like this?

173
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,083
'Cause I'm starving.

174
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,416
[LUKE]
He doubled back. Did he see me?

175
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:22,541
[LUKE] What the--?
What is this guy doing?

176
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,708
I've never felt so good!

177
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,625
[SWORD whistles]

178
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,875
Not hungry?

179
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,708
[WAITRESS]
Welcome-welcome! What'll it be?

180
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,791
'Nother round of
the same, please?

181
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,000
[WAITRESS]
You got it!

182
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,875
Uh, I didn't put
my order in yet.

183
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,875
There's something
special for you.

184
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,250
[WAITRESS]
Sorry for the wait!

185
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,583
Wow.

186
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,833
[WAITRESS] For the gentleman,
care of the house.

187
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,416
[LUKE]
Thought as much.

188
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,791
[SWORD]
I chased him last night myself.

189
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,541
[LUKE] Didn't take him
long to shake you.

190
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,916
[SWORD]
I noticed.

191
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,541
[LUKE] Bastard clocks in
at speeds I've never seen.

192
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:33,291
Trouble is, he doesn't follow
a discernable pattern.

193
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,583
[ZARUBA] Trying to understand
what's in a Horror's mind

194
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,000
is pointless.

195
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,916
He's startin' to
look like a problem.

196
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,958
Please. No rush.

197
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,875
[ENITH]
Excuse me.

198
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,208
Sorry. I wonder if you
could help me out.

199
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:32,291
I'm looking for someone
who disappeared last night.

200
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,083
Maybe you've seen him around?

201
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,875
[ENITH]
Uh.

202
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,416
Easy.

203
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,583
Hey, don't just brush
'er off. Girl needs help.

204
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:44,916
[LUKE grumbles]

205
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:50,708
And not only that, he
left his wheelchair behind.

206
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,833
All the kidnappings lately
have me fearing the worst.

207
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,833
See, he was sort of
famous a few years ago.

208
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,166
Yeah? What for?

209
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,791
[ENITH] Quick sprint.
He was in the Olympics.

210
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,416
But then...

211
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:08,416
Oh my God! Seriously?
Why would you keep that from me?

212
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,708
It's not a big deal.
Look, don't worry.

213
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,958
[ENITH]
Don't worry?

214
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,750
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't.

215
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:19,000
What have we been doing?
Why won't you let me in?

216
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,416
Baby, please. I'm sorry, okay?

217
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,458
Next time I'm hurt, you'll be
the first to know, I swear.

218
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,875
[ENITH]
Next time you're hurt?

219
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,875
I can't do this!

220
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,166
Enith.

221
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,625
[ONLOOKER A]
Look out!

--[thud]
--[CROWD screams]

223

[ONLOOKER A]
Holy--! Somebody do something!

224
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:52,875
Get it off him!

225
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,708
[ONLOOKER B]
We need an ambulance!

226
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,750
He's been hitting rehab
like a champ and all,

227
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,166
it's just been a long and
difficult road, y'know?

228
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,625
I understand.

229
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,958
Hey, we see him,
I'll give you a call.

230
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,208
I'd really appreciate
it, thank you.

231
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:13,125
[SWORD] Listen, I feel
bad even bringing this up,

232
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:16,958
but like you said, there's been
a lot of kidnappings lately.

233
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:20,250
Might not be a bad idea
to prepare for the worst.

234
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,125
Yeah, no. I get it.
Thanks for being real.

235
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,208
Sure.

236
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,375
[ENITH]
Well, see you 'round, I guess.

237
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,666
That's something.

238
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,791
An ex-sprinter who can't
walk, up and vanishes?

239
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,375
Yeah.

240
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,041
S'pose sometimes it's worth
doing things my way.

241
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,958
[LUKE] If you find the Horror,
I want you to lead him here.

242
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,791
Huh? Why's that?

243
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,208
[LUKE]
I don't want another mess.

244
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,916
Why's he always gotta
make it so complicated?

245
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,250
[ZARUBA] They say misery loves
company. Why shouldn't crazy?

246
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,916
Heh. Must be why
I hang on to you.

247

When you weren't here,

251
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,333
I thought somethin'
might've happened.

252
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:39,500
Don't you dare say
you were worried.

253
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,000
Thank God you're okay.

254
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,083
Huh?

255
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:50,333
[HARDY]
Yeah. I can run again.

256

How's that even...?

257
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:55,083
Whew! Takes a lot out of me.
Damn, I could eat a horse.

258
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,916
Matter fact, I could
eat just about anything.

259
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,500
I'm a bottomless pit.

I stuff myself to the gills,

in how hungry I am.

Baby.

263
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,750
[HARDY]
I can't stand it. So hungry.

264
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,958
So hungry!

Should we corner him?

We don't have much choice.

you could help me out.

you seen this man?

Uh-uh.

Sorry, no.

she's been crying.

Shut up. She's right there.

I'm just sayin'.

she's dealin' with it.

Hey, Zaruba.

What was that you said
about crazy lovin' company?

"Like attracts like."

just relax once in a while.
