00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,750
[CROWD screaming]

167
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,416
[DARK KNIGHT]
Do you understand now?

168
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,166
The power you believe in
has no meaning.

169
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,583
[LIZZY laughs]
Hey, big brother!

170
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,125
[DARK KNIGHT]
So be it.

171
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:01,833
[SWORD yells]

172
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,041
[SWORD grunting]

173
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,708
[DARK KNIGHT chuckles]
Excellent!

174
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,458
This is who you really are!

175
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,166
Give me everything!

176
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,500
Show me the Golden
Knight's rage!

177
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,583
Prove yourself a force
to reckon with!

178
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,791
[SWORD grunting]

179
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,000
[SWORD]
I've had enough of you!

180
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,875
What in the world is going on?

181
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,458
[SWORD, DARK KNIGHT grunting]

182
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,375
[DARK KNIGHT groans]

183
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:26,250
[SWORD grunting]

184
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,166
[SWORD yells]

185
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,583
[DARK KNIGHT laughs]

186
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,541
[DARK KNIGHT retches]

187
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,666
[DARK KNIGHT] I'd forgotten
what it feels like.

188
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,791
What a wondrous thing--pain.

189
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,166
What a gift you've given me!

190
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,666
[SWORD yells]

191
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,708
[DARK KNIGHT]
We shall fight again.

192
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:17,916
I leave Sophia Hennes in your
more than capable hands.

193
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,833
Until next time...

194
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,875
Keep your blade sharp!

195
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,041
Police continue
their investigation


196
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,416
into last night's explosion,


197
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,791
but as yet, no official
cause has been given.

198
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,375
We take you now
live to the scene,

199
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,583
where the Russell City
Police Department...

200
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,708
[BOTH gasp]
