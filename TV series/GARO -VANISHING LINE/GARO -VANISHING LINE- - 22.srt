168
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,666
beside Martin Hennes
that can grant access.

169
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,541
Sophie.

170
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,291
[ZARUBA] You must be awfully
fond of that particular spot.

171
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,666
Will something come to you
if you sit there long enough?

172
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,166
Sorry if I'm quiet.

173
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,958
There's nothing to be sorry for.

174
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,541
It's just, I...

175
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:18,875
If this happens to be

176
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,125
about my riding into
the Dark Knight,

177
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,875
I highly recommend
you let it go.

178
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,416
But I'm so...

179
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,250
[ZARUBA] Souls across
the world are in jeopardy.

180
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,458
ELDO NET is
spreading like wildfire.

181
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:36,291
The King hungers.

182
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,250
The power he gets from
harvesting souls

183
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,750
he'll turn around
and use to harvest

184
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:43,833
even more in a
never-ending cycle.

185
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,208
But there's hope.

186
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:49,583
Seems your brother gave you
the keys to the kingdom.

187
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,416
It just so happens the souls
being harvested are stored

188
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,958
in a special unit you alone
can give us access to.

189
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,125
[ZARUBA] Sword and the others
are loath to see you endure

190
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,875
more than you
already have, of course.

191
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,208
They prefer to spare you
and do this themselves.

192
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,000
Futile endeavor if you ask me.

193
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,625
[CHILD]
Hey, Sophie!

194
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,250
[ZARUBA]
That's an encouraging sign.

195
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,541
[LIZZY]
Sword!

196
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,416
I found an infiltration device!

197
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,666
That's great.

198
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,375
Now what about access?

199
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,583
[LIZZY]
No luck.

200
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,875
There doesn't seem to be a way

201
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,666
without administrative
privileges.

202
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,875
[SWORD]
Hmm.

203
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,625
Of course there isn't.

204
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,583
Well, keep looking.

205
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:22,875
[LIZZY]
Sure thing.

206
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,500
Just swear to me
you'll be careful.

207
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,541
Your brother couldn't
ask for a better entourage.

208
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,458
I'll have this lug's
back to the bitter end.

209
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,750
I promise.

210
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,708
I know I can count on you.

211
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,791
Oh, and uh,
goes for you to, Zaruba.

212
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,958
[SOPHIE]
Take me with you.

213
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,208
I can't just sit here.

214
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,625
I don't know if I can help.

215
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,125
But it's wrong
for you to go alone.

216
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,333
Sophie.

217
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:54,000
[SOPHIE] After everything
you've done for me.

218
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,666
It's the least I can do.

219
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,458
Honey, 'less
you want to get eaten,

220
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,958
I suggest you stay here.

221
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,958
It's not about me.

222
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,375
I can't undo the
damage I've caused.

223
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,916
We're beyond that now.

224
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,083
Still, though.

225
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,458
I can follow your
example if you let me.

226
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:18,583
For once, like you guys,
let me protect someone.

227
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:20,750
I have to try!

228
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,958
Give me a chance!

229
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,666
Let's ride.

230
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,833
Ah! Yeah!

231
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,166
[gasps]

232
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,000
Just so you know, darling.

233
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,375
I expect to get that back.

234
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,500
Good to go?

235
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,250
Let's do it!

236
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,833
Hell yeah!

237
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,208
[LIZZY]
Which gate do you want?

238
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,791
[SOPHIE]
Huh? Who's that?

239
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:30,666
[SWORD]
My sister.

240
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,625
[SOPHIE]
Seriously?

241
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,666
[SWORD]
Watch out!

242
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,583
Perfect timing.

243
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:44,666
You two get out of here!

244
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,000
This asshole's our problem now!

245
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,541
Just go.

246
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,583
We got this.

247
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,041
I won't make
the same mistake twice.

248
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,625
You must be destroyed.
