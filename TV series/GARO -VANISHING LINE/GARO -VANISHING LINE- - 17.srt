1
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:14,083
[QUEEN]
A perfect plan?

2
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:16,875
The Golden Knight
is inching his way closer.

3
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:18,333
[BISHOP]
It's no matter.

4
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,458
We have options.

5
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,416
The "princess"
needn't be an issue.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,375
[PEDRO] I'm just gonna
come right out and say it.

7
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:26,208
I wanna take him down,
and I'm gonna need your help.

8
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:30,291
When Lizzy died, I felt
the exact same way you do.

9
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,958
Thing is...

10
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:35,166
There's no one left to remember
her if I let myself die.

11
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,541
[PEDRO gasps]

12
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,250
Monica!

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:45,458
[sobs]

14
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:49,333
[BISHOP]
Doctor Stanley, my friend!

15
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,041
How goes the work?

16
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,166
[DR. STANLEY]
Quite well.

17
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,958
My control simulations suggest

18
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:57,208
the fusion experiment's
objective is in sight.

19
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:00,666
Don't go too
easy on the tests, now.

20
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,958
We want this stage
to be an extravagant one.

21
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,541
[gasps]

22
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,541
Huh? What is going on?

23
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:20,625
Mi-mi-mi-mi!

24
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,791
Myah!

25
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,875
Um, what is that?

26
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,333
Ugh. Smells like a sewer.

27
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,541
They're legion!

28
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,875
A whole battalion of Horrors!

29
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,375
How far away
are we from El Sanvados?

30
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,333
Sixty-two miles
south by southwest.

31
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,625
Right through the center
of that mountain range.

32
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,541
I'll meet you there.

33
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,000
Take care of Sophie.

34
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,791
Got it.

35
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:07,625
Wait.

36
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,250
Where are you going?

37
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,791
Sophie.

38
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:15,000
I need you to do
whatever Gina says.

39
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,833
I've got this.

40
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,833
None of these uglies're
gonna lay a finger on you.

41
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,375
Sword, wait!

42
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,250
Ah, it's to be the
predictable move, I see.

43
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,875
[BISHOP laughs]

44
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,125
Should be interesting
at least, though.

45
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,458
Let us see how the
all-powerful Garo fares

46
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,125
against numbers like these.

47
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,083
You gotta be kiddin' me.

48
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,750
Looks like the bad guys
are goin' all-out.

49
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,000
[ZARUBA]
Prudent, in their way.

50
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,166
They know not to
try you one-on-one.

51
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:53,958
Right!

52
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,291
Throttle the Golden Knight

53
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,291
but spare the feisty
young girl for His Majesty.

54
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,791
Of course. I'm sure one or
two trifling little injuries

55
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,791
can be overlooked

56
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,083
[SWORD]
A massive roving barrier.

57
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,500
I didn't think Horrors
could be that organized.

58
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:16,208
[ZARUBA] That's what I call
piling stink upon stink.

59
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,000
I know, right?

60
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,791
Welp, whadda say we clean house?

61
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,250
Let's do it!

62
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,583
C'mon! Turn us around!

63
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,000
Sword'll get himself killed!

64
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,541
We've got to go back!

65
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:52,625
Please!

66
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:53,625
Gina!

67
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:54,916
--[GINA] Shut up!
--[SOPHIE] Huh?

68
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,833
[BISHOP chuckles]

69
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,208
And... au 'voir.

70
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,208
[SWORD gasps]

71
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,083
He's here.

72
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:59,416
[BISHOP] Why don't you make
this easy and surrender?

73
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,708
We mean you no harm, I promise.

74
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,875
Come along quietly
and be done with it.

75
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,375
You seem like a
reasonable creature.

76
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,541
Accept that this is the end.

77
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,666
Garo's only mortal, after all.

78
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,000
Surely you don't want
your Alchemist friend there

79
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,083
to meet with the same fate?

80
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:19,875
[GINA]
Duck!

81
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,916
I didn't get him.

82
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,583
Rat bastard.

83
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,708
Should've expected as much.

84
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:38,708
Seems these unruly little
wenches prefer to play it rough.

85
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,166
Hold on to your ass, kid.

86
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,750
Did we, uh..?

87
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:29,958
'Kay.

88
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,000
Sophie, darling, pull on
that lever behind your seat.

89
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,250
[GINA]
Don't worry about trying to aim.

90
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,333
Just keep shooting.

91
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,958
Fire!

92
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,125
Huh?! Yes!

93
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:33,250
[pants]

94
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,583
We might've found your weapon.

95
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,000
[SOPHIE shrieks]

96

It's Luke!

Nice shootin' there, hot stuff.

100
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,041
Your timing's impeccable.

101
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,500
I'll handle the rest of 'em.

102
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,583
Holy crap.

103
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,125
The Land of Guidance
must've set him up

104
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,500
with a pretty hardcore
firing range.

105
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:14,708
[SOPHIE]
Whoa.

106
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:15,708
[GINA]
Well, well.

107
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,041
Looks like the
barrier's defunct.

108
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,000
El Sanvados is
on the other side.

109
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,791
We're just about there.

110
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,708
[gasps]

111
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,208
G... Gina.

112
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,916
What do you know,
we've reached this level's boss.

113
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,583
Dear, oh dear.

114
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,833
You really should've
taken me up on my offer.

115
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,125
If you'd surrendered,

116
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:45,041
I wouldn't have had
to resort to such tactics.

117
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,791
They distilled
the power of Horrors

118
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,916
and infused them into a machine.

119
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That's how they're able
to be active in daylight.

120
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,791
What a load of bullshit.

121
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,458
[gasps]

122
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,416
Sophie!

123
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,958
Sorry. That one's on me.

124
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,416
Should've moved quicker.

125
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,625
Hey, Luke.

126
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,708
Been a while, huh?

127
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,333
Oh, hey.

128
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,250
No rest for the weary!

129
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:13,750
Talk to me.

130
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:14,791
Zaruba.

131
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,458
Please tell me Sword's okay!

132
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,041
There is more to that
lug head than meets the eye.

133
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,583
So we're keeping a low profile
until this blows over.

134
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,250
[SOPHIE]
Are you... Are you all right?

135
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,708
Does it hurt?

136
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,000
[ZARUBA]
What exactly do you take me for?

137
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,458
[SOPHIE]
Sorry.

138
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,791
[ZARUBA]
It's all right.

139
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,208
I'll have them fix me up
once we get to El Dorado.

140
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,125
That's assuming they
have anything resembling

141
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,041
a repair shop in the vicinity.

142
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,583
[SOPHIE]
No, really.

143
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,875
[SOPHIE]
I'm useless.

144
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,791
I can't do anything.

145
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,041
Everyone has to protect me.

146
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,208
Sword.

147
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,541
Gina.

148
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,083
Luke.

149
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,708
Even you.

150
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,750
And look what good it's done.

151
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,333
I don't...

152
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,416
Why? Why are they targeting me?

153
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,875
I'm sorry.

154
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,041
All that I ever wanted was
to try and find my brother.

155
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,541
[ZARUBA]
Don't cry.

156
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,250
There are fewer things more
futile than tears.

157
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:43,083
None of this is
your fault, Sophie.

158
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:48,041
You have the right to live
according to your beliefs.

159
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:51,041
And Garo exists
to protect that right.

160
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,416
Whether it costs injury,

161
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,708
or whether the battle
ultimately claims our lives,

162
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,166
we will always be
there to protect you.

163
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,541
Live, Sophie.

164
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,833
Never stop moving forward.

165
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,625
[ZARUBA]
Enough.

166
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,291
Get on.

167
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,375
I thought it curious

168
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,333
we broke through their
defenses so easily.

169
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,625
Something awful
must be lying in wait.

170
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:33,750
So what do we do?

171
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,791
Sword will most
certainly follow us.

172
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,166
We'll have to find
a way to buy some time.

173
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:08,958
Come.

174
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,375
Princess.

175
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,916
Do not resist me.

176
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,708
Surrender.

177
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,916
[ZARUBA]
Sophie.

178
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,166
Regardless of what happens,

179
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,291
remember what I said
about moving forward.

180
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,375
Zaruba.

181
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,250
Please don't.

182
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,916
Zaruba!

183
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:59,541
[ZARUBA]
That was rather fun, partner.

184
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,500
[DARK KNIGHT] A brilliant death,
if only for a Madou ring.

185
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,416
My respects.

186
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,541
[DARK KNIGHT] To think a mere
trinket could do such damage

187
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,708
to someone of my caliber.

188
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,833
The Dark Knight himself.

189
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,916
[SWORD]
Zaruba.

190
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:45,500
Lend me your invinceble will,
and stand beside me in eternity!

191
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,458
[DARK KNIGHT]
You absorbed his essence.

192
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:09,750
A clever way to
bolster your strength.

193
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,791
Excellent.

194
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,916
Let us put it to the test!

195
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,666
[DARK KNIGHT laughs]
A worthy nemesis.

196
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,875
I look forward
to our next meeting.

197
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,750
[DARK KNIGHT] Prepare
to die in exquisite agony

198
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,833
when our blades cross again.

199
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:12,291
Till we both draw
our final breath.

200
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,958
[SWORD]
Bastard!

201
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,875
[ZARUBA ]
Live, Sophie.

202
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,958
Never stop moving forward.

203
00:21:56,833 --> 00:22:04,625
[SOPHIE sobs]
