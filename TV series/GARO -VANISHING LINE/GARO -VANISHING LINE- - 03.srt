[PARTY GIRL A]
Who is that?

167
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,541
[GINA]
Our objective is the top floor.

168
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,625
But there are two hurdles
we have to clear.

169
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,208
First off, we shut down
the security system,

170
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,125
whole building goes offline.

171

under the circumstances.

Even if he sees us comin',

174
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,541
not much he can do about
it with his defenses down.

175
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,625
[GINA] Won't be a
straightforward cut 'n run.

176
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:40,916
Only way to shut off the network

177
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,333
is with a keycard
containing Damian's DNA.

00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,208
That seems a bit complicated.

worry about the secret sauce.

I'm not allowed to be curious?

use a fresh drink.

Okay. What's the second hurdle?

193
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,000
[GINA] Once the system's down,
there's a time limit.

194
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,416
We won't have much of a window.

195
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,041
How not much?

[GINA]
Sixty seconds.

Oh, great. Sounds fun.

198
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,750
After that, the security system
will reboot automatically,

199
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,041
so work fast.

200
