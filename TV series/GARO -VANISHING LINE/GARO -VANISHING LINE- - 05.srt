Found me some pocket money.

Can I possibly interest
you in a cheese dog

and an avocado salad with that?

17

What do you think...
about getting married?

Sweetheart, don't you think
our precious baby girl

would like to hold on
to daddy's hand?

Ah, yes. I contacted
you the other day.

We're the Browns.

This is my husband and
our lovely daughter, Emily.

[SWORD]
A ring that controls Horrors?

[GINA] To be fair,
it's still just a rumor.

Lady Viola--silver screen
hopeful when she was younger.

54
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,791
Sadly, she tended to
blend in with the extras,

'least till her rivals
started dropping out.

Scandal. Injury.

Bit by bit, the path
to stardom opened up.

58
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,583
She rose to fame on the
backs of others' misfortune.

59
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,666
Married a industy high roller.

60

When he died a few years later,
she came into a lot of money.

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,166
Started work as an education
consultant, of all things.

62
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,708
She essentially listens to rich
parents whine about their brats,

all while staying relevant
and raking in the dough.

A rags-to-riches story
if I've ever heard one.

So what I'm hearing is you think

66
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,166
she owes it all to
a Horror, right?

67
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,875
Well, word on the street
is the lady possesses a ring

68

that controls demons.

Pretty good retirement

provided you don't give
a damn about your soul.

Does a ring like
that really exist?

Thank you, Lady Viola.

Establishing a relationship

They seem way more

their own kids.

It has less to do with wealth

Some folks just prefer the

I did the same thing in my room.

It's how I used to

so my brother wouldn't

00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,541
to turn those children
into kittens.

317
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,375
Nice one. What
took you so long?

318
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,041
I had a close call of my own,

319
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,041
just so we're all
aware, thank you.

320
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,541
What? C'mon. You had
this in the bag.

321
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,708
[GINA]
Fair enough.

322
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,625
I was just about to
finish up, actually.

323
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,666
[SWORD chuckles]

324
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,416
You barely even
needed me here. Hm?

325
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,333
Tough luck, huh?

326
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,291
Sucks you didn't get
anything valuable out of it.

327
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,791
The good stuff's
hard to come by,

328
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,500
which of course is what
makes it worth chasing

329
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,625
in the first place.

330
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,458
Chasing. Yeah. Right.

331
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,250
For the privilege of
dangling rare items

332
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,750
in front of rich weirdos.

333
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,500
What a thrill.

334
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,916
Oh, it is.

335
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,041
'Specially when the item's
not as rare as they think.

336
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:45,083
Sword, please. Just stop.
She's smarter than you.

337
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,666
[SWORD]
Hm? Sophie.

338
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,625
You've decided, then?

339
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,875
Yeah.

340
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,625
What's going on?

341
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,041
[ZARUBA]
Brace yourself.

342
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,333
When women band together,

343
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,875
you'll never get
the better of them.

344
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,166
Trust me.

345
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,625
Right. So today's the day
I finally get a yes.

346
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,500
We follow the El Dorado
lead together. Period.

347
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,833
Ugh, seriously?

348
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,791
We'll start real simple:
Tell me everything you know.

349
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,333
Where is it? What's it do?

350
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,583
When'd you start looking
for it and for how long?

351
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,333
[SWORD]
Uhh...

352
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,916
Where d'you think you're going?
You can't leave me here!

353
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,583
Hey! Focus! I want answers!

354
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:26,833
And don't even
think about trying

355
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,583
to skip out on me
like last time!

356
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,958
I'm on to you, mister!
You're stuck with me!

357
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,125
[SWORD]
Wait!
