infiltrating Cygnusram-Tech.

his grand design and stepped in.

166
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,333
[LIZZY]
They're on to us!

167
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,750
Those are bots are designed
to eliminate bugs in the system.

168
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,083
Hold on a minute.

169
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,166
I thought those were souls
pulled into El Dorado.

170
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,250
[LIZZY]
They were.

171
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,500
The bots absorbed them.

172
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:34,875
That's how it is here.

173
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,708
Eventually even the
strongest souls get overridden

174
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,375
by the simulation.

175
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,750
You're telling me
the King... is you?

176
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,250
[gasps]

177
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,750
Wha... What is it?

178
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,708
Talk to me, Sophie.

179
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:16,458
What's wrong?

180
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,041
Please don't cry.

181
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,750
[MARTIN]
What do you think?

182
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,541
I made it especially for you.

183
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,708
I'm so sorry.

184
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,541
You've been all
by yourself for so long.

185
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,750
The GarEden contract just...

186
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,416
I couldn't tell anyone
what I was working on.

187
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
Not even my little sister.

188
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,666
[SOPHIE]
Martin.

189
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,041
I realize that's
a terrible excuse.

190
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,041
'Cause at the end of the day
I left you in the dark.

191
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,083
So alone for six months.

192
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:05,000
[SOPHIE gasps]
Six months?

193
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,250
Was the social worker they sent

194
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,916
from GarEden good
to you, at least?

195
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,041
I told them to treat
you like a princess.

196
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,291
Your letters sounded
like you were having a ball.

197
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,500
--I'm glad for that.
--[SOPHIE] Stop.

198
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,875
It hasn't been six months!

199
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,416
Martin!

200
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,708
Listen to me very carefully.
You've been gone three years!

201
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:21,875
Don't you get it?

202
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,541
This isn't what
I look like anymore!

203
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,625
I'm 13 years old now!

204
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,750
After you disappeared, they...

205
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,875
...they took me to an orphanage.

206
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:31,750
Since then,

207
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,291
I've looked everywhere for you!

208
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,125
That's been my whole life!

209
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,541
And this city?

210
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,958
The El Dorado on the outside;
it's all run by Horrors!

211
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,583
Monsters that eat people!

212
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:41,708
Monsters?

213
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:42,791
You've got to be kidding me.

214
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:43,666
I'm not!

215
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,333
I've seen 'em with my own eyes!

216
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,666
They're disgusting!

217
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,875
They treat El Dorado
like a cafeteria!

218
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,750
Everyone's being eaten!

219
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:51,583
Right. Okay.

220
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,708
Calm down.

221
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,916
Monsters don't
actually exist, Sophie.

222
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,833
[SOPHIE] Where are they
keeping the real you?

223
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,833
What are you talking about?

224
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,666
You mean, like, my body?

225
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,375
[SOPHIE]
Mm.

226
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,416
A special room in GarEden tower.

227
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,791
But what does that matter?

228
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,333
We've got everything
we could possibly need right--

229
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,458
We've got to find you
and leave now!

230
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,875
I haven't come all this
way for us to get stuck!

231
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,958
Sophie, please. Take it easy.

232
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,166
There's no good reason
to be afraid of staying here.

233
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,666
Martin!

234
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,625
[MARTIN] I'm not saying it
doesn't take getting used to.

235
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:26,000
But El Dorado's entire purpose
is to make people happy.

236
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,458
That's what I made it for.

237
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,125
Why I stick around,
keep the system in order.

238
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,333
[MARTIN]
You want reassurance?

239
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,166
Fine.

240
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,666
Here it is.

241
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,000
As long as I have
this ring, I'm in control.

242
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,333
[MIA] Whosoever comes
into possession of the ring

243
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:44,375
is changed by
the vileness within.

244
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,958
It renders the
heart's desire manifest.

245
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,125
Take it off!

246
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,875
The ring is pure evil!

247
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:52,583
What?!

248
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:53,458
You're not in control!

249
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,041
The Horrors are just using you!

250
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:55,708
Take it off!

251
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:56,916
I'm begging you--!

252
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,791
Sophie! The ring is
proof of my strength!

253
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,125
It signifies that
this is my world!

254
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,666
Look! Stop talking like this!

255
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,833
You're scaring me.

256
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,583
Horrors aren't real!

257
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,291
[SOPHIE]
So many people have died.

258
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,875
So many innocent lives.

259
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,291
Gone... forever...

260
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,875
Because of that ring!

261
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,750
[gasps]

262
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,083
Sophie. What's wrong with you?

263
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,750
All I wanted was
to make you happy--

264
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,250
to see that beautiful smile.

265
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,041
Huh? Who got to you?

266
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,458
Some rival company's been
filling your head with nonsense!

267
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,000
Really? Come on!

268
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,583
[MARTIN]
No. It checks out.

269
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,583
Rumor has it corporate
spies have snuck into

270
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:39,000
the other El Dorado sabotage us.

271
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,166
I'm willing to bet those
are the real Horrors.

272
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,583
It's not like that!

273
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:43,791
Please, you've got to listen!

274
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,875
Stop it! Somebody's
playing with your mind!

275
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,291
Come here.

276
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,000
[LIZZY]
Step aside!

277
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,833
When the ancient one stole
El Dorado's prototype

278
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,041
from Cygnusram-Tech,
he insinuated himself

279
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:25,708
into the GarEden Coporation
to further his research.

280
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,458
Once there, he discovered
a brilliant young developer

281
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,708
named Martin Hennes, eking
out a living in the ghetto.

282
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,041
Sophie's genius big brother.

283
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,666
The ancient one gave
Hennes a powerful ring.

284
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,166
The legion of Horrors
controlled by it

285
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,166
did the boy's bidding,
like servants.

286
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,833
So, he was able to
finish his El Dorado.

287
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,125
Very soon, his brainchild
will be connected

288
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,625
to networks all over the world.

289
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,041
The hunt for human
souls will widen its scope.

290
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,916
Take down the ancient one.

291
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,166
Destroy the system.

292
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,791
Liberate the agonized souls
ensnared in this purgatory.

293
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,541
What else would you expect
the Golden Knight to do?

294
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,875
[MARTIN] There's nothing
this place doesn't have.

295
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,041
Ageless wisdom.

296
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,958
Everlasting tranquility.

297
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,583
Peace. Truth. Abundance!

298
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,125
Everything you could
ever want, for the asking.

299
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,458
Trust me.

300
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,125
And it's only the start.

301
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,541
Know how many signed up
for the alpha test?

302
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:36,708
One thousand.

303
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,500
For the beta test,
we had three thousand.

304
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:43,291
When version 1.0
was released, five thousand.

305
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:46,125
And right now, in El Dorado 2.0.

306
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,833
I wouldn't believe it if I
hadn't run the numbers myself,

307
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,458
but we're ten thousand strong!

308
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,958
[MARTIN] And soon, my baby will
expand its reach exponentially.

309
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,708
We're talking global domination!

310
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,083
It'll be everywhere!

311
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:05,666
All mankind will have access
to the ideal community!

312
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,791
[SOPHIE]
How could you do this?

313
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,458
[MARTIN]
Hmm?

314
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,208
People are dead.

315
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,625
Can't you see
what's really going on?

316
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,375
El Dorado is a killing ground!

317
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,041
It's all right!

318
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,000
She's still alive!

319
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,625
He hasn't gotten to her yet!

320
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:31,250
[SWORD]
Sophie!

321
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,625
Where have you been?

322
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,916
[gasps]

323
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,500
Leave him alone!

324
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,958
[SOPHIE]
Sword!

325
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,875
[MARTIN]
I don't understand.

326
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,083
[SOPHIE gasps]

327
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,125
What's going on?

328
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,833
Sophie.

329
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,583
[MARTIN screams]

330
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,375
What're you doing?

331
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,833
Save the girl
and destroy El Dorado.

332
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:58,875
Burn it all to the ground.

333
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,500
Don't hesitate.

334
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,291
Hey.

335
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,291
You have a nice nap?

336
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,041
[SWORD]
What the hell...?

337
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,000
Is this for real?

338
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,833
[LUKE] Did you reach
the true El Dorado?

339
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,833
So? What have the
Horrors got cooked up?

340
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,625
[GINA]
Where are you going?

341
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,125
Sophie.

342
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,916
I have to save her.

343
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,458
[MARTIN]
Wait.

344
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,541
Don't.

345
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:31,333
Sophie. What are you doing?

346
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,666
[SOPHIE]
Look around.

347
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,333
Really look.

348
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,833
These are all
the innocent people

349
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,166
your El Dorado has killed!

350
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,208
[SOPHIE]
The dead stay dead, Martin.

351
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,125
They don't come back.

352
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,625
Anymore than someone
who's become a Horror.

353
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,041
[SOPHIE]
If that's true...

354
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,208
[SOPHIE]
I'm sorry. I have no choice.

355
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:30,375
I cannot let you
hurt anyone else!
