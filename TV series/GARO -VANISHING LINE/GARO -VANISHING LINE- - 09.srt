Just a little longer. Please.

165
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,125
Uh?

166
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,125
[ZARUBA] Don't say I
didn't try to warn you.

167
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,916
Aw, c'mon.
Enough a' that talk.

168
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,041
[SOPHIE]
Ah! Atta girl, Lucy!

169
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,875
I knew you could do it!

170
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,666
So we've given her a name?

171
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,208
If you two ladies
will excuse me,

172
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,791
we could use some more firewood.

173
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,291
I'll be back in a few.
Holler if you need me.

174
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,916
Okay!

175
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,750
[SOPHIE] Didn't Sword say
Lucy eats mostly soft grass?

176
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,541
How do you think he
knows that? Random.

177
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,166
Yeah. Zaruba doesn't
like to talk much.

178
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,333
You like it?

179
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,208
Wait here, 'kay? Good girl.

180
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,958
I'll go find some more!

181
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,208
[clattering]

182
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,416
Uh?

183
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,250
Uh.

184
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,125
This ought'a last us
for a while.

185
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,958
Hey, is, uh,
everything all right?

186
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,208
Where's, what's-her-name, Lucy?

187
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,208
[SOPHIE]
I should've listened.

188
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:12,333
I should've talked.
Really talked to her.

189
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,166
I treated her like...

190
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,166
[SOPHIE sobs]

191
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,500
Uh...

192
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,583
I miss her so much it hurts!

193
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:29,250
Sister! [cries]

194
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,833
Sadness never leaves.

195
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:56,041
And regrets are never
completely forgotten. But...

196
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,250
[SWORD grunts]

197
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,208
Despite the pain,
life goes on.

198
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,125
We have to move forward
as best we can.

199
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,125
This is good.

200
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:21,125
[SWORD] Those stars make up
the constellation, Cassiopeia.

201
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,166
Just under 'em there--

202
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,500
[SOPHIE]
Andromeda, right?

203
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,958
[SWORD]
Heh. Ah, very good.

204
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,666
You learn that at the home?

205
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,000
She took us to the
planetarium once.

206
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:33,166
Not long after I came to
live there, actually.

207
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,791
Pretty sure the whole purpose
was to cheer me up.

208
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,916
I was a crybaby.

209
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,750
[SOPHIE] Sister knew
just about everything.

210
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,666
Loved pointing things out.

211
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,541
First time in my life I'd
ever noticed the stars.

212
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,791
Wow.

213
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,250
Until then, I'd never looked up.

214
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:56,625
Never knew my world was just
a tiny part of all... this.

215
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,333
[SISTER]
Sophie.

216
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,333
What would you say if I told
you this doesn't hold a candle

217
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,166
to the actual night sky?

218
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,500
That's right. Don't worry.

219
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:10,333
I have a feeling you'll get to
see the real thing one day.

220
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,208
Perfect.

221
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,583
[SOPHIE]
Rise and shine! Time to go!

222
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,083
What the--?

223
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,708
Just a few more minutes.

224
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,000
Come on. You do not
want me to help.

225
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,208
[groans]

226
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,125
Okay! Read you loud and clear!

227
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,416
[SOPHIE laughs]

228
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,583
[SOPHIE]
Put your clothes on.

229
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,000
All right. Let's go.

230
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,708
The wretch dares return
empty-handed, I see.

231
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,750
Where is the girl you were
ordered to bring back?

232
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,791
I'm fairly astonished
you possess the gall

233
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,583
the show your face, fool.

234
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,458
Sacrificing poor Pawn
without a thought.

235
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,458
You've totally ruined
my ingenious plan.

236
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,666
The Golden Knight.

237
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,958
I assumed you traded blows?

238
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,375
Well? His blade.

239
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,333
How was it?

240
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,541
Perfect.

241
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,958
Soon, he will be here to
challenge me again.

242
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,125
He's coming here?

243
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,250
Has this news been
brought to the King?

244
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,125
There is no need.

245
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,666
Oh? Dear oh dear.

246
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,416
Things have taken a
rather thorny turn.

247
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,708
Whatever my happen,

248
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:20,083
I will not allow the king
to be put in harm's way.

249
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,208
Golden Knight.

250
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,333
I'm waiting for you.
