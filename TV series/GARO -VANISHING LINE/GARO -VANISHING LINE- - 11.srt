1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,625
[WAITRESS] The Knight made
evident in his remarks

2
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:16,333
that this king is targeting her.

3
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,250
Now, because protecting her
while battling adversaries

4
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,666
may prove to be difficult,

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,708
several alchemists
have been dispatched.

6
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:25,875
Your orders are to meet up
with them in Sun Dell Diós.

7
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,916
[SOPHIE]
I should've listened...

8
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:30,791
[SOPHIE]
I should've talked.

9
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,458
Really talked to her.

10
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,416
I mean, what's the point
of doing what you do?

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,875
[SWORD] Guess that's just
the path I chose.

12
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,041
All right. Let's go.

13
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,000
[LUKE]
Mom!

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,250
[ADELAIDE]
Luke...

15
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,000
True strength
isn't about power.

16
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,625
It's not something you
obtain for yourself.

17
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:59,083
It's something you
obtain for... others.

18
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,708
[ALFIL] Known kidnapper
and serial killer.

19
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:14,875
Son of a bitch targets children.

20
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,958
So, there a reason
you're tellin' me?

21
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,541
[ALFIL] He fled the city 'bout
a week ago on a bike.

22
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,500
Highway patrol spotted
him couple days back.

23
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:27,250
Fifteen K marker west of
the city along route 69.

24
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,666
We chased him, of course.

25
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,208
But he got away.

26
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,666
[ALFIL]
There was a shootout.

27
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,208
One officer dead.

28
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,458
Another in critical condition.

29
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,458
Afterwards, the suspect
continued west

30
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,583
along the same road.

31
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:42,458
[NATALIA]
He's headed here, you mean.

32
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:46,666
[ALFIL] Yeah. He could pass
right through or stop in.

33
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,416
'S got a kidnap victim in tow.

34
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,750
Little girl.

35
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,041
God only knows what that
bastard'll do to her.

36
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,208
[gasps]

37
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,833
Heh. Try not to sweat it.

38
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,375
We don't let scum go
their merry way.

39
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:00,708
[ALFIL]
I know.

40
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,708
[NATALIA] This town don't
turn the other cheek.

41
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,666
Not with the likes of him.

42
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,666
Sun Dell Diós.

43
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,333
This is the place.

44
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,666
You're kidding me, right?
This looks like a movie set.

45
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,166
The fox is in the hen house.

46
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,583
Where's Alfil?

47
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,666
[NATALIA] He's out patrollin'
the boonies right now.

48
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,500
I haven't heard from him.

49
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,166
[OLDER LADY 11A]
What should we do?

50
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,291
[NATALIA]
Nothin's changed.

51
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,541
Stick to what we talked about.

52
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,208
[OLDER LADY 11A]
Be careful, Natalia.

53
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,541
If I were your age,

54
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,208
I'd be right there in
the thick of it with you.

55
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,166
It's okay.

56
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,291
Just do your part.

57
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,875
We'll be fine.

58
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,916
Welp, nothin' much
for us to do till

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,583
our escort makes
contact, I s'pose.

60
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,416
Might as well look around
in the meantime.

61
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't know if that's
such a good idea.

62
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,750
Always keep things in
balance, no matter the job.

63
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,416
After all, we must enjoy
life to the fullest!

64
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Yeah, that's your motto.

65
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,166
You're damn right it is.

66
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,416
[OLDER LADY 11A]
Beggin' your pardon, strangers.

67
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,458
My, the pair of you
must've come a long way.

68
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,708
Oh! What precious
little things you are!

69
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,875
[laughs]

70
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,250
[BOTH]
Hm?

71
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,083
[NATALIA]
Right.

72
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,916
He'll be here any second.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,416
[ALFIL]
Shit.

74
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,791
Of all the times to get caught
out here with a flat tire.

75
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,750
Can you manage?

76
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,875
[NATALIA] We'll have to.
He just walked in.

77
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,166
[ALFIL]
Natalia, don't get any ideas.

78
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,000
[NATALIA] We've got this.
Just get here quick like.

79
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,541
[ALFIL sighs]
Keep it simple.

80
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,083
Howdy, folks!

81
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,916
Hi, um, we're not
from around here,

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,708
but some sweet old lady outside?

83
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,583
She told us this
was the place to be.

84
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,750
[NATALIA]
Really?

85
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,958
That was right nice of her.

86
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,458
[SOPHIE] What kind of
specials do you have?

87
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,875
Let's see now.

88
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,208
[SWORD]
Anything?

89
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,500
[ZARUBA] No sign of a Horror
for the time being.

90
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,875
[SWORD]
Got'cha.

91
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,708
[inhales]

92
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,750
Thank you for this bounty.

93
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:04,125
[NATALIA]
Huh? Wait... huh?!

94
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:08,541
[sighs] Sword. What'd I say?

95
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,666
[SWORD]
I'm sorry, is something wrong?

96
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,291
I'm just grateful
for our blessings.

97
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,416
What's the problem?

98
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,041
Knock it off.
You're embarrassing.

99
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,458
[laughs]

100
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,833
[SOPHIE]
Times have changed.

101
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,000
[SWORD]
I haven't.

102
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,666
Excuse me, ma'am?

103
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,958
Any chance you can whip up

104
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,458
something for us
only the locals eat?

105
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,125
Uh, sure.

106
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:30,250
No whinin' when it burns
a hole in your gut though.

107
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,458
[BISHOP] Things appear
to be going smoothly.

108
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,791
[ALFIL]
For now.

109
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,750
Why don't we kill him
while we have the chance?

110
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,458
[BISHOP] His fate is not
for us to decide.

111
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,791
If it were up to me, I'd
wrap this up and go home.

112
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,208
[ALFIL]
What about the girl?

113
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,625
Why's the King want her?

114
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,875
[BISHOP] File that under
"none of your concern."

115
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:53,500
Stay focused. The objective
takes top priority.

116
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,250
It's wise we avoid an
outright confrontation.

117
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:00,333
Exploit our human buffer
until there's no alternative.

118
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,333
As you wish.

119
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,166
[laughs] Hey, hon!

120
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,791
We'll do the special.
Enough for the whole table.

121
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,166
[WAITRESS 11A]
You got it.

122
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,791
Consider this our treat, friend.

123
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,416
We don't want to be a bother.

124
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,916
What? Hey, c'mon.
It's nice havin' someone

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,750
else to talk to every
now and again.

126
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:20,208
Yeah, not a lot of
folks stop by here.

127
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,875
With this hospitality?

128
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,000
Thanks, you guys.

129
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,791
[BOTH laugh]

130
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,000
Why don't more
people come here?

131
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,666
Little too wild west for 'em?

132
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,041
[NATALIA]
Yep, till recently.

133
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,041
[SWORD]
Hm?

134
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,250
[NATALIA] Government abandoned
the area west of here.

135
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,375
Cops, too.

136
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,125
No law anywhere.

137
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,333
The lowlifes who took over only
came here for three things:

138
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:46,041
theft, murder, and destruction.

139
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,083
Things got bad for a while.

140
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,833
So, then, why not just
pack up and move?

141
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:55,291
Well, leavin' home's a lot
harder than you might think.

142
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,791
All right. Bon appetit, y'all.

143
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,375
[SOPHIE]
Stop!

144
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,083
[SOPHIE gasps]

145
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,291
Yeah. Dig in!
Don't hold back!

146
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,458
Good luck cleanin' your plate!

147
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:16,041
Going back. So, "till
recently," you said.

148
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,291
Have things gotten better?

149
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,791
[NATALIA]
They sure have.

150
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,666
We decided to take matters
into our own hands.

151
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,833
Protect ourselves.

152
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,250
[SWORD]
Ah.

153
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,750
See, things got so damn bleak,
we'd reached our limit.

154
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,708
'S not like we could
go to the police.

155
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,208
We formed our own
vigilante group.

156
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,833
Sounds hardcore.

157
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:38,250
This town's developed its own
unique brand of law enforcement.

158
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,375
One that doesn't look
too kindly on folks

159
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,916
who think they're above it.

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Can't let the guilty go

00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:39,541
[BISHOP laughs] The buck,
as they say, stops here.

322
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,083
[NATALIA, SOPHIE gasp]

323
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,125
[BISHOP] Our charade has
outlived its usefulness.

324
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,000
[ALFIL]
I'm very sorry.

325
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,000
Wha... What is that?

326
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,416
What's happenin'?

327
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,375
[ALFIL]
So, what's the plan now?

328
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,291
[BISHOP] Well, things
being what they are,

329
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,875
I don't mind if you get a
little rough-and-tumble.

330
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,291
He-- He's one of them!

331
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,625
What are you doin'?

332
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,708
[SOPHIE]
Miss Natalia!

333
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,458
No! Stop!

334
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,416
As long as you don't resist,
I don't intend to hurt you.

335
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,041
[DARK KNIGHT] My master is
the King of El Dorado.

336
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,958
You have been summoned.

337
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,958
Stay back! You try anything,
and I will shoot!

338
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,708
[BISHOP laughs]
So you want to play?

339
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,416
Such a fierce little creature.

340
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,125
[laughing]

341
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,291
[gunshot]

342
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,583
[SWORD]
Sophie!

343
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,208
Sophie! You okay?

344
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,625
Talk to me, please!

345
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,250
Sophie!

346
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:51,041
[SOPHIE gasping]

347
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,000
[SWORD]
Sorry about that.

348
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,333
Must've been terrifying.

349
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,458
You really held your own.

350
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,666
Sword! [wails]

351
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:07,458
[ALFIL groans]

352
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,833
[SWORD]
Hm?

353
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,125
It's not over yet.

354
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,666
Can you take care of Natalia?

355
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:21,041
[ALFIL] Heh. Should have killed
you when you rolled into town.

356
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,375
[ALFIL groaning]

357
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:36,250
[ALFIL growling]

358
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,833
[BISHOP]
Oh! That does it.

359
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,125
You're a dead man.

360
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:44,416
[ALFIL screaming]

361
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,625
[SOPHIE]
Are you all right?

362
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:52,458
Sophie.

363
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:56,291
[HORROR ALFIL roars]

364
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,750
The hell is that?

365
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:04,125
Don't worry. Sword knows
exactly how to handle it.

366
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,625
Zaruba!

367
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,791
[SWORD grunts]

368
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,250
[NATALIA gasping]

369
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,208
[BISHOP] I would expect nothing
less from the Golden Knight.

370
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,875
[BISHOP]
Allow me to introduce myself.

371
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,166
I am Bishop, if you please.

372
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,791
Won't you join me to see
the King of El Dorado?

373
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:32,333
He would very much like
to see you, dear princess.

374
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,875
[gasps]

375
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,208
[SOPHIE]
Gina!

376
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,916
[HORROR ALFIL groans]

377
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,958
[BISHOP]
Now, that is a shame.

378
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,000
Not the best of feeding
grounds, but a decent one.

379
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,708
[SWORD]
Feeding ground?

380
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,000
Ah. I get it.

381
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,708
The sheriff was a Horror
before he came here.

382
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,666
[GINA] He's different from
the minor-league types

383
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,416
we tend to deal with.

384
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,041
[gasps]

385
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,750
[SWORD grunting]

386
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,458
[BISHOP]
Do forgive me.

387
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,166
I've no desire to
fight you mano a mano.

388
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,375
Be a gentleman and die
quickly, won't you.

389
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,208
There's a good lad.

390
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,125
[SOPHIE]
It's gone.

391
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,250
Completely gone.

392
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:08,083
The damn bastard used the entire
town as part of his scheme.

393
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,708
Meh. No big deal.
I took care of everything.

394
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,625
The place can be rebuilt, as
long as the people are safe.

395
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,750
Yeah, but... Wait. Did you?

396
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,333
[GINA] He didn't want
them on our ass, so...

397
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,791
I sealed them up
for their own good.

398
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,583
Natalia's gonna have a
pretty rough time of it

399
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,500
trying to explain
what went down.

400
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,541
Oh, they're a
tightknit community.

401
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,000
I wouldn't worry too much.

402
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,875
Yeah. You've got a point.

403
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,083
All well and good,

404
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,375
'cept we have another
fly in the soup now.

405
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:49,000
That's right.
He calls himself Bishop.

406
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,500
Well, isn't that interesting.

407
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,333
[SOPHIE]
I'm so stoked!

408
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:56,500
Gina's coming with
us to El Dorado!

409
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,916
[SWORD grunts]

410
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,166
Not by choice.

411
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,666
I've got a reputation
to live up to, don't I?

412
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,125
[BOTH laughing]

413
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,333
Let's go.

414
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,166
[ZARUBA]
Well done, Sophie.

415
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,208
Not bad at all, kid.

416
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,291
[SWORD]
Uh?

417
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,916
[gasps]
