1
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:13,541
'Bout time.

2
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:16,166
Martin. I...

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,625
I was beginning to doubt
we'd ever see each other again.

4
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,791
Welcome to El Dorado.

5
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,250
This place, what is it?

6
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:28,083
[MARTIN] A world I've
created out of nothing.

7
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,958
Where people can be truly happy.

8
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,458
A utopia.

9
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,458
Are my eyes playing tricks?

10
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,000
It's been a while, Your Majesty!

11
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,000
Seriously.

12
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,291
They go too far
with it sometimes.

13
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,541
Makes me kind of uncomfortable.

14
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:46,500
As long as I have this ring,
I'm in control.

15
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:47,291
Take it off!

16
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,041
The ring is pure evil!

17
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,125
You're not in control!

18
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:51,333
The Horrors are just using you!

19
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:52,166
Stop talking like this!

20
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,458
You're scaring me.

21
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,250
Horrors aren't real!

22
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:57,750
[SOPHIE]
Gone.

23
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:59,333
Forever.

24
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,666
Because of that ring!

25
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,291
[SOPHIE gasps]

26
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,500
Sophie.

27
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:23,000
[MARTIN screams]

28
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,375
[MALE RELATIVE A]
Absolutely out of the question.

29
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:28,541
[MALE RELATIVE B]
Our hands are tied.

30
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:30,958
You understand.
I wish we could take them.

31
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,375
[FEMALE RELATIVE] There's
no inheritance to speak of.

32
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,583
That complicates matters
for whoever's responsible.

33
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:35,916
[MALE RELATIVE B]
That's ridiculous.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,458
Why should we have to be saints?

35
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:40,125
[MALE RELATIVE A] I say just
ship them off to an institution.

36
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,083
Let them be the state's problem.

37
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,833
[MARTIN]
Sophie is my responsibility.

38
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:08,416
If I don't protect her,
no one will.

39
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,666
More than that.

40
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,583
It's my job to give her
the life she deserves.

41
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,916
To make a world where can
thrive, where she can be happy.

42
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:20,750
[MARTIN gasps]

43
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,000
Sophie.

44
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,166
What are you doing?

45
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,666
[SOPHIE]
Look around.

46
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,125
Really look.

47
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,541
These are all
the innocent people

48
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,708
your El Dorado has killed!

49
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,458
[gasps]

50
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,708
[SOPHIE]
The dead stay dead, Martin.

51
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,666
They don't come back.

52
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,708
Anymore than someone
who's become a Horror.

53
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,416
[SOPHIE]
If that's true...

54
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,833
[SOPHIE]
I'm sorry. I have no choice.

55
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,625
I cannot let you
hurt anyone else!

56
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,916
[MARTIN]
Why?

57
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,791
Dear me. That was dramatic--

58
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:38,333
Cur. The Golden Knight is alive.

59
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,541
Well?

60
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:43,666
Let's hear what you have
to say for yourself.

61
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,291
Why is he not dead?

62
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,375
[BISHOP]
Hmph.

63
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,750
I have no earthly idea.

64
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,958
By rights the vat ought
to have finished him off.

65
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,416
I'll need a much
better answer than that.

66
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,208
He will not escape
a second time.

67
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:05,083
[BISHOP] Seems we still have
a few bugs to work out.

68
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,375
Strange.

69
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,416
[BISHOP]
What's this?

70
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,291
Sibling rivalry?

71
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,791
[SOPHIE] Everything
changed after you left.

72
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,708
I don't even remember
what "normal" is.

73
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,416
Things happened.

74
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,625
Terrible things.

75
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:32,041
People lost their lives
because of you.

76
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,583
Good people.

77
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,875
All they wanted was to carve out

78
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,875
a little piece of happiness
for themselves.

79
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,875
That's what Horrors
take advantage of.

80
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,208
'S how they feed.

81
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,083
You may not even realize
you've become one of them,

82
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,333
but you have!

83
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,416
You... You'll just keep
preying on the innocent,

84
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,750
and once you've transformed,
there's no coming back!

85
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,708
You can't stop.

86
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,166
You're possessed.

87
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,666
You'll just go on killing
till someone cuts you down.

88
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:11,750
[MARTIN]
Stop!

89
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,166
This is crazy!

90
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,541
[SOPHIE] Sword and the others
will be here any minute.

91
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,916
Once they see you for
what you are, that'll be it.

92
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,541
They're honor-bound
to fulfill their objective.

93
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,583
But...

94
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,333
You're my responsibility.

95
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,875
I should be the one.

96
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,000
[SOPHIE] For all the
lives you've sacrificed

97
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,291
to my happiness.

98
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:38,375
For the people you've destroyed.

99
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,833
It's the least I owe them!

100
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,291
[MARTIN]
Why?

101
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,291
[SWORD] Essentially, anyone
sent to the quote-unquote

102
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:51,125
"true" El Dorado has their
soul ripped from their body.

103
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,666
But according to Lizzy,
Sophie is still intact.

104
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,166
There's probably a baked-in
admin mode for safety.

105
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,916
Martin would have to come
and go as he pleased, right?

106
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,458
They couldn't very well work
out the kinks otherwise.

107
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,166
[GINA]
He's being used.

108
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,125
Kid's just a pawn.

109
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,750
Sophie's our priority.

110
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,916
Everything else comes second.

111
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:34,791
Dammit!

112
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,333
Hold on!

113
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,708
Wake up.

114
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:58,625
[screams]

115
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,208
All yours!

116
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,208
[gasps]

117
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,500
[SWORD]
Sophie!

118
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,125
[MARTIN]
Why is no one picking up?

119
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,916
Queen. Bishop. Knight. C'mon!

120
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,666
Seriously?

121
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,250
Give me a break!

122
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,375
You're telling me this
entire building's offline?

123
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,208
The system's been hacked.

124
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,750
What the Hell's going on here?

125
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,750
[MARTIN]
Why is she doing this?

126
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,541
Has Sophie lost her mind?

127
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:04,041
[MARTIN]
This one's a joke, too.

128
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,375
Why is it so hard for people
to get what I'm trying to do?

129
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,666
Cerebral scanning could
be a total game-changer.

130
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,666
No chip implants, no expensive
driver installation surgery.

131
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,625
Users can jump right in
without going under the knife.

132
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,791
The virtual experience
would be open to everyone.

133
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:24,291
Ugh! What's so difficult to
understand about that?

134
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:28,875
This tech isn't just innovative;
it could transform the world!

135
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,375
Are you okay?

136
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,166
Uh, yeah.

137
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,416
I'm fine. Sorry.

138
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,666
I'm so close
to making this work.

139
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,416
Just give me a backer.

140
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,916
A company where I can
bring my ideas to life.

141
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,041
GarEden?

142
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,666
The El Dorado Project.

143
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:07,125
Wait, these people
have read my stuff?

144
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,625
Hah! And they actually want to
bring me in on their project?

145
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,458
[door bell]

146
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,916
Please forgive the intrusion.

147
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,916
[MARTIN]
What is this place?

148
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,333
[QUEEN]
Welcome to GarEden, Mr. Hennes.

149
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,541
Allow me the honor

150
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,000
of introducing your
personal support staff.

151
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,041
I am Miss Queen.

152
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,791
This is Mr. Bishop,
the general manager.

153
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,541
[QUEEN] And of course, our
chief of security, Mr. Knight.

154
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:52,125
We've spared no expense ensuring
your every need is provided for.

155
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,958
On just one condition,

156
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,583
we ask in return that
you aspire to greatness.

157
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:57,958
Act as our King.

158
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,791
Uh... I don't understand.

159
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,041
Your king?

160
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:05,000
[QUEEN] That trinket is
a symbol of our pledge.

161
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,916
Together, we shall realize

162
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,083
mankind's age-old
dream of utopia.

163
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,500
You are the rallying
point of our vision,

164
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:19,250
the undisputed leader who
will clear the way to paradise.

165
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,500
[QUEEN] I implore you not
to worry about your sister.

166
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,958
Arrangements for her welfare
have already been made.

167
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,375
Ease your mind.

168
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:32,333
You may work free from concern.

169
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,250
It wouldn't hurt you
to take small break, sir.

170
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,666
Just a few minutes.

171
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,125
I'm getting close.

172
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,791
I'm on the verge of
a serious breakthrough.

173
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,291
I can feel it.

174
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,666
Almost there.

175
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,833
I'm so close to creating
a perfect world for Sophie.

176
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,625
[QUEEN] She's lucky
to have you as a brother.

177
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,250
But you mustn't neglect
your own needs.

178
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:16,458
Surely not everything your
heart desires is altruistic.

179
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,208
C'mon, Miss Queen.

180
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,541
You're beautiful.
Uh, it's just...

181
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,625
You know...

182
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,416
I have priorities.

183
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,375
[QUEEN]
Heh.

184
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,000
Such a pure soul is my King.

185
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,958
[MARTIN]
What is that supposed to mean?

186
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,791
[MARTIN]
This place.

187
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,708
Evacuate, now!

188
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,458
Don't look back!

189
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:30,875
[MARTIN gasps]

190
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,041
[SOPHIE]
Look around.

191
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,750
Really look.

192
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,250
These are all
the innocent people

193
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,000
your El Dorado has killed!

194
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,541
[MARTIN vomits]

195
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,791
[MARTIN] There's nothing
this place doesn't have.

196
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,041
Ageless wisdom.

197
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,875
Everlasting tranquility.

198
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,541
Peace. Truth. Abundance.

199
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,916
Oh god.

200
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,291
Almost there.

201
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:20,041
I'm so close to creating
a perfect world for Sophie.

202
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,041
I'm sorry.

203
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,166
Sophie.

204
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,750
I did this for you.

205
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:31,958
[SOPHIE]
If that's true...

206
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,833
I have no choice.

207
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,916
I cannot let
you hurt anyone else!

208
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,875
Martin!

209
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,291
Listen to me carefully.

210
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,625
You've been gone three years!

211
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,291
If it's true.

212
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,958
What she said.

213
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:02,666
Then it's my fault.

214
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,625
This is all on me.

215
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,791
I'm a murderer.

216
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,250
[VOICE]
More or less.

217
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,666
No one to blame but yourself.

218
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,250
'S why she tried to kill me.

219
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,875
What else could she have done?

220
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,083
I deserve it.

221
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,750
[VOICE]
Yes, you do.

222
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,458
You're beyond the reach
of her forgiveness.

223
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:25,458
She has a pure soul,
just as you once did.

224
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:29,208
She cried, because of me.

225
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,791
I backed her into a corner.

226
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:36,750
All I wanted,
was to make her happy.

227
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,250
I swear.

228
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,208
[VOICE] Of course, and look
what it's driven you to do.

229
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,750
What's killing a few thousand
innocent people compared

230
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,416
to your precious
little sister's smile?

231
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,416
If only you could relish the sin
and nourish your inner darkness.

232
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,958
Drown in your desire.

233
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:57,875
I can help you do that,
if you wish.

234
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,875
[VOICE]
Go on.

235
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,708
Take charge of your fate.

236
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:12,791
[QUEEN laughs]
Bullets are fruitless.

237
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:18,125
I am one of El Dorado's
three Sacred Blades!

238
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,750
In me, His Majesty
has the ultimate shield!

239
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,791
How amusing.

240
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,708
Ha! Useless things.

241
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,166
See ya later, bitch.

242
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,291
[MARTIN] It wasn't
supposed to be like this.

243
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,916
Martin. Stop.

244
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,916
[MARTIN]
I screwed up.

245
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,666
I just wanted things
to be how they were.

246
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,166
But it's all a lie.

247
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,750
Heh.

248
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,875
None of it's real.

249
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,083
Not you.

250
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,375
Not me.

251
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,583
I might as well
not even have a sister.

252
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,666
Oh! Here we go!

253
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,250
It's about time.

254
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,375
Certainly kept us
in suspense, didn't he?

255
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,333
We should all disappear.

256
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,083
[gasps]

257
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:26,041
Sophie.

258
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,416
[SOPHIE gasps]

259
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,833
Martin, no!
