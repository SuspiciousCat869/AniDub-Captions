[MORIARTY]
This is Shinjuku's West Side.

2
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:18,143
A tidy grid of well‐lit streets,
teeming with smiling citizens,

3
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:21,021
walled off from the morass
of crime and chaos swirling

4
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:22,814
just to the east.

5
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,359
There on the dark
streets of Kabukicho,

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,528
where the trumpeting of
elephants rings in the hour

7
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:31,907
and hood‐rat kids lurk in every
shadow, six detectives roam.

8
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,868
Freaks, geeks,
losers, and loons to a one.

9
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,454
Where they roam,
chaos will surely follow.

10
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:40,207
And you fine folks are invited
to watch their wild war

11
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,959
of wills and wits!

I am the band!

We both know you're
nothing without me.

18

get over your butthurt

19
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,144

[CLIENT 4A] I mean, what am
I supposed to do about this?

You gotta help me, pal!

27
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,504
That's not a job
for a detective,

28
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,630
why are you asking me?

29

Oh, why not help
the poor little darling?

30

It's not like you have
anything else going on.

Hey, kiddo.

Buddy, I'm begging here!

I just need a little bit of
muscle with me as a precaution.

[HUDSON]
A prospective client.

He says he's having trouble
with the neighbors.

Apparently, they're
being too loud.

Boring. Any idea
where Sherlock is?

Oh!

But not your own toothbrush cup!

You really wanna get on
his good side, don't you?

It's not like I'm

with the guy.

But I don't know how else
I can get him to take my case.

77
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,235
You could try buying
"people" food, for starters.

Sounds like a fun

So check this out, Sherlock.

Mrs. Hudson gave me a few passes
to the Eight Heavens bath house,

82
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,997
and I was wondering
if you might want to go.

Okay. I figured that
you wouldn't want to miss

but fine, suit yourself.

I mean, it might just be me,
but I think getting out

going straight to

Uh?

[MORIARTY] What did you need
bad enough to borrow money?

95
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,409
Several things, actually.

96
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,912
It's my first time
at a public bath.

97
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,789
Mister Kyogoku warned me.

98
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:34,209
He says that all kinds of seedy
figures hang around bathhouses.

99
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,546
And a lot of not‐strictly‐legal
business gets done there.

100
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,757
Yeah, but you'll get
used to that kind of stuff.

I'm having a drink, why?

109
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:12,694
Don't you like milk too?

110
00:06:12,736 --> 00:06:14,404
When I think about it,
it's kind of weird that

111
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:16,657
it's the only thing they've got
in the vending machine.

00:06:16,698 --> 00:06:19,618
[MORIARTY sighs]
You missed the whole point.

113
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,537
You're supposed to finish
taking your bath first

114
00:06:21,578 --> 00:06:22,996
and then you drink the milk.

115
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:24,414
Huh. I've never heard of that.

put on your trunks!

to climb into this?

No, dummy, you use
that to rinse off!

123

This... water is a bit chilly...

It's supposed to be, dummy.

[WATSON yells]

126
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:54,778
This whole public
bathing deal is confusing.

127
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,196
There are so many rules.

128
00:06:56,238 --> 00:06:58,490
You really are
a dummy, aren't you?

130
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:03,704
[MORIARTY]
Here you go.

131
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:08,417
[WATSON]
If you don't mind me asking,

132
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,003
what is the deal with
the two of you exactly?

133
00:07:11,044 --> 00:07:12,880
[SHERLOCK]
And what if I do mind?

134
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:15,883
[WATSON] Eh. I'm just
curious, that's all.

135
00:07:15,924 --> 00:07:17,801
James hangs out
with you all the time,

136
00:07:17,843 --> 00:07:19,344
even though the two
of you aren't relatives

137
00:07:19,386 --> 00:07:21,889
and you're not anywhere
close to the same age.

138
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,391
I didn't invite the
little urchin into my place.

139
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:26,685
[MORIARTY]
Hey, come on, don't be mean.

140
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:28,020
It's not like I'm a stalker.

141
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:30,856
You know you'd miss me
if I stopped coming. Huh?

142
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:32,441
[laughs]

143

[WATSON]
A dog...?

144
00:07:38,113 --> 00:07:39,781
I guess I like Sherlock
because it feels like

145
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:42,201
he and I have a lot
of things in common.

146
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:44,244
What kind of
things are we talkin'?

147
00:07:46,288 --> 00:07:49,958
[MORIARTY] Jeez. Slow down
and enjoy yourself for once.

[WATSON grunts]

149
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:55,464
[WATSON]
Is that a... monkey?

150
00:07:57,674 --> 00:08:00,302
Are you sure it's okay for you
to be out here this late?

151
00:08:00,344 --> 00:08:03,555
Aren't you gonna get in
trouble with your parents?

152
00:08:03,597 --> 00:08:04,848
No, it's fine.

153
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,392
Dad's real estate gig means
he's barely ever home,

154
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:09,436
and Mom is always
coming in late.

155
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:11,063
Uh‐huh...

156
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:13,357
[MORIARTY] My sister bugs me
about it sometimes though.

157
00:08:13,398 --> 00:08:15,776
She's mad that I get to stay
out late and she doesn't.

158
00:08:15,817 --> 00:08:17,486
[WATSON]
A pheasant, too!

159
00:08:19,196 --> 00:08:22,616
[WATSON] So, uh. I'm seeing
some sketchy people around.

160
00:08:22,658 --> 00:08:24,243
It's not just me, right?

161
00:08:27,663 --> 00:08:29,289
[WATSON]
Oh, come on!

162
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,126
You found Momotaro's head.

163
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:34,127
[WATSON]
Huh...?

164
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,545
[MONKEY]
Shit, dude, where is he?

165
00:08:35,587 --> 00:08:38,006
We've only got a half an
hour till the show starts!

166
00:08:38,048 --> 00:08:40,175
[DOG]
Relax, man, it'll be fine.

167
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:41,343
[WATSON]
What's with those guys?

168
00:08:41,385 --> 00:08:44,012
[MORIARTY]
Oh. They're the Momotaros.

169
00:08:44,054 --> 00:08:45,389
They're pretty big
in the Kabukicho

170
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,182
underground music scene.

171
00:08:47,224 --> 00:08:49,810
Any teenager around here
would know about their shows.

172
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:53,146
And they wear these...

173
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:55,524
Hey, guys, is everything
going okay?

174
00:08:57,234 --> 00:09:00,028
[PHEASANT] Momotaro's gone.
We don't know where.

175
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,030
Maybe he got out
of the bath before you.

176
00:09:02,072 --> 00:09:04,783
[DOG] No, all his stuff is still
in his locker where he left it.

177
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:06,618
Could he have forgotten
to put his clothes back on?

178
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,869
That's dumb.

179
00:09:07,911 --> 00:09:10,372
[MONKEY] I'm telling you,
he straight‐up disappeared!

180
00:09:10,414 --> 00:09:13,166
He got spirited away.
He's not coming back!

181
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,377
[DOG] Do you think we're gonna
have to call off the show?

182
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:17,546
[MONKEY]
Wha‐‐?! No way we're doing that!

183
00:09:17,587 --> 00:09:20,632
Well, if you want,
we can help you look for him.

184
00:09:20,674 --> 00:09:22,467
Ah. We can make it
a race to see

185
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:24,636
who's the first
to find Momotaro.

186
00:09:24,678 --> 00:09:26,680
Loser has to buy
the others milk!

187
00:09:26,722 --> 00:09:28,307
[DOG]
This isn't a game, you guys.

188
00:09:28,348 --> 00:09:29,933
[MONKEY] We're dealing
with a crisis here!

189
00:09:29,975 --> 00:09:31,226
It'll all be fine.

190
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:33,228
See? He's a master detective!

191
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:44,114
The best there ever was!

192
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:50,203
[doorebell ringing repeatedly]

193
00:09:50,245 --> 00:09:52,205
Yo, Takezo Yamaoka.

194
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:54,124
You know you can't
hide in there forever!

195
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,417
I'm sure he
stepped out for a bit,

196
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:56,960
so stop bothering the neighbors!

197
00:09:57,002 --> 00:09:59,379
Yeah, that's what
he wants you to think.

198
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:01,798
If you like having
a door, then open up!

199
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:05,969
[SHERLOCK] You're really
committed to the mask thing.

200
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:09,222
[MONKEY] Yah! Hey‐‐ Back off‐‐
What are you trying to do?!

201
00:10:09,264 --> 00:10:11,058
[MORIARTY] Sherlock,
leave the monkey alone!

202
00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:12,559
[SHERLOCK growls]

203
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:13,643
Now.

204
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:15,937
Start from the beginning
and tell us what happened.

205
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:18,315
[MONKEY] We all came to
the baths with Momotaro,

206
00:10:18,357 --> 00:10:20,942
and now we're still here
and he's somewhere else.

207
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:22,903
Since you guys wear
your masks so much,

208
00:10:22,944 --> 00:10:24,988
maybe you've forgotten
what his face looks like.

209
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,239
[MONKEY]
That's stupid.

210
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:28,033
We've been in this band
together for the ten years

211
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:29,701
we've been in Tokyo.

212
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:32,204
[DOG] Yeah, we leave the masks
off when we're at the house,

213
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:33,914
and Pheasant and I
have known Momotaro

214
00:10:33,955 --> 00:10:35,665
since we were in daycare.

215
00:10:35,707 --> 00:10:38,043
[MORIARTY] Which one of
you was the last to see him?

216
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:39,753
[PHEASANT]
I guess me?

217
00:10:39,795 --> 00:10:42,923
I was sitting in the outdoor
bath about a half an hour ago,

218
00:10:42,964 --> 00:10:45,050
and I saw the back of his
head through the window.

219
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:47,135
[SHERLOCK]
So where did he run off to then?

220
00:10:47,177 --> 00:10:49,596
Ya don't see peaches disappear
like that on their own.

221
00:10:49,638 --> 00:10:52,682
Someone snuck him off to
a secluded spot and ate him.

222
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:55,060
Ugh. Well, now
I'm even more confused.

223
00:10:55,102 --> 00:10:56,311
How about this.

224
00:10:56,353 --> 00:10:58,063
Did anything unusual
happen with any of you

225
00:10:58,105 --> 00:10:59,815
before you came to the baths?

226
00:10:59,856 --> 00:11:01,024
[MONKEY]
But we didn't lose track of him

227
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:02,818
until after we all got here.

228
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:03,819
[MORIARTY]
Just play along.

229
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,321
Anything out of the ordinary
that happened on the way?

230
00:11:06,363 --> 00:11:07,781
Anything at all.

231
00:11:07,823 --> 00:11:09,991
[MONKEY]
Huh, lemme think...

232
00:11:11,034 --> 00:11:12,828
[MONKEY]
Friggin' Momotaro!

233
00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:15,455
He said he'd be here waiting
for us. So where is he?

234
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:19,543
[DOG] Uh. It looks like
he just messaged me.

235
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:22,462
He says he's running late and we
should get started without him.

236
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:24,631
[MONKEY]
You don't have to tell me twice.

237
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:28,552
[MONKEY]
Huh? Hey, you coming?

238
00:11:28,593 --> 00:11:30,387
[PHEASANT]
I'll wait for him out here.

239
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:32,055
[DOG]
Cool. See you in a bit.

240
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:37,102
[MONKEY] Why did you stay
outside waiting for him anyway?

241
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:38,520
[PHEASANT]
I was...

242
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:41,481
I needed to talk to him about
some band stuff or whatever.

243
00:11:46,194 --> 00:11:47,696
[PHEASANT]
What are you doing?

244
00:11:49,114 --> 00:11:51,116
Did you get into a fistfight?

245
00:11:51,158 --> 00:11:53,410
[PHEASANT]
Uh! No, I just...

246
00:11:54,953 --> 00:11:56,538
[MONKEY]
What happened to your hand?

247
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,873
[PHEASANT sighs]

248
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:02,294
[PHEASANT] I got in an argument
with Momotaro this morning.

249
00:12:03,587 --> 00:12:05,922
[PHEASANT] He always changes my
songs so that he can get a cut

250
00:12:05,964 --> 00:12:08,049
of the royalties
as co‐writer,

251
00:12:08,091 --> 00:12:09,968
and I told him I
wasn't okay with it.

252
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,803
It's not about the money,
it's about respecting

253
00:12:11,845 --> 00:12:14,556
my contribution to the band.

254
00:12:14,598 --> 00:12:16,141
[DOG]
Dude...

255
00:12:16,183 --> 00:12:19,269
[MONKEY] Huh. Is that what
the coffee was about?

256
00:12:19,311 --> 00:12:20,479
[PHEASANT]
Coffee?

257
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,939
[MONKEY] Yeah, I heard a loud
noise coming from the basement

258
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:24,983
and went to check it out.

259
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:26,276
When I opened the door,

260
00:12:26,318 --> 00:12:28,612
nobody was around,
but there was a pot of coffee

261
00:12:28,653 --> 00:12:30,155
spilled all over the floor.

262
00:12:30,197 --> 00:12:32,157
Turns out it was you jokers.

263
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:34,784
Now you owe me one
for cleaning up after you.

264
00:12:34,826 --> 00:12:36,411
[PHEASANT gasps]

265
00:12:36,453 --> 00:12:37,579
[MORIARTY]
Hmm...

266
00:12:37,621 --> 00:12:38,830
[MONKEY]
What?

267
00:12:38,872 --> 00:12:39,873
[PHEASANT]
Nothing.

268
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:41,875
What happened after that?

269
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:43,376
[PHEASANT] I was hoping
I could talk to him again

270
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:44,794
before the show.

271
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:50,634
[PHEASANT] I'm sorry
for hitting you earlier,

272
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:52,052
but I'm not backing
down on this,

273
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:54,554
and I'm not gonna let
you keep blowing me off.

274
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:57,974
[PHEASANT]
Hey! Momotaro!

275
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:01,186
[PHEASANT] I didn't see
the point in pushing it further,

276
00:13:01,228 --> 00:13:02,854
so I came in after him.

277
00:13:04,147 --> 00:13:06,525
[PHEASANT] Then I met up with
these two, and here we are.

278
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:08,610
[MORIARTY] Did anything
about that seem off?

279
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:10,028
[PHEASANT]
Huh?

280
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,113
The way Momotaro was acting.

281
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:14,991
[MONKEY] I'd say so.
He's not usually that quiet.

282
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:16,535
[PHEASANT] It was kind of
awkward since we'd just been

283
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:17,702
in a fistfight.

284
00:13:17,744 --> 00:13:18,828
[MONKEY]
Yeah, but still...

285
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,038
[PHEASANT]
It's not like he normally

286
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,498
talks to me much anyway.

287
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,166
Do you have any thoughts, Dog?

288
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,418
[DOG] I came straight to the
sauna as soon as we got here,

289
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,420
so I missed all that.

290
00:13:27,462 --> 00:13:28,922
[MORIARTY]
I see...

291
00:13:28,964 --> 00:13:31,341
[MONKEY] You see what?
Did you figure something out?

292
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:33,301
I don't think Momotaro
ever actually made it

293
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:35,345
to this bathhouse
in the first place.

294
00:13:35,387 --> 00:13:37,174
[gasping]

295
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:42,926
[MONKEY]
But I saw him in the baths!

296
00:13:42,968 --> 00:13:44,469
That wasn't Momotaro.

297
00:13:44,511 --> 00:13:45,512
[MONKEY]
Huh?!

298
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:48,765
Sherlock. Am I right?

299
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:50,767
[SHERLOCK] I would be willing to
bet that none of you have seen

300
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:52,894
Momotaro and Dog in
the same place since

301
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:54,646
you arrived at the bathhouse.

302
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:56,898
[MONKEY]
What... are you getting at?

303
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,276
When Pheasant spotted
Momotaro sitting in the bath,

304
00:13:59,317 --> 00:14:01,778
Dog claims he was
here in the sauna,

305
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,114
but does he have proof of that?

306
00:14:04,156 --> 00:14:05,740
[DOG]
Uh, how do you mean?

307
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:06,908
[MORIARTY]
If you're telling the truth,

308
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,619
we should be able to find
somebody who saw you in here.

309
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:12,330
You guys don't exactly

Because you weren't.

You were in the baths,
where Pheasant saw you

316

wearing Momotaro's head.

any message from Momotaro.

the inside of this thing,

we'd find tissue samples
from both Dog and Momotaro.

[KOBAYASHI] Sorry, your door
was giving me trouble!

00:15:28,657 --> 00:15:30,283
I ended up breaking
it a little bit.

Wait, stop! We didn't get
permission to come in here!

Yeah, that's why I'm

[DOG] I don't figure lying
about it would do me any good.

You can call the police,
I won't try to resist.

I don't get it. Why, Dog?

you kill Momotaro?

Yes! It's finally showtime!

376
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:58,246
Say, what's the deal here?

377
00:16:58,288 --> 00:17:00,665
We've got two confessions
to the same murder!

378
00:17:00,707 --> 00:17:03,335
Then obviously, one of
these two has to be lying.

379
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:05,670
Once you get past that hurdle,
it's dead simple.

380
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:07,130
'Kay, but why though?

381
00:17:07,172 --> 00:17:08,256
Here's the score.

382
00:17:08,298 --> 00:17:10,508
Momotaro and Pheasant
got in a fistfight earlier,

383
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,385
and Momotaro took a nasty hit.

384
00:17:12,427 --> 00:17:14,638
He must have smacked
his head on the way down.

385
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:16,681
Pheasant left him there
to get to the bathhouse,

386
00:17:16,723 --> 00:17:18,933
and Momotaro died where he fell.

387
00:17:18,975 --> 00:17:20,935
But Monkey said he went
to the basement later,

388
00:17:20,977 --> 00:17:23,396
so how could he have missed
his band buddy's body?!

389
00:17:23,438 --> 00:17:25,940
Seems like somebody
stowed it out of sight.

390
00:17:25,982 --> 00:17:27,525
Yeah? Who?

391
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,152
How slow can you be?

392
00:17:29,194 --> 00:17:31,237
The only one it could
have been is Dog.

393
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:32,864
Hiding the body
was simple enough,

394
00:17:32,906 --> 00:17:34,407
but the blood was an issue.

395
00:17:34,449 --> 00:17:37,035
He couldn't clean it, so he
dumped the coffee to hide it.

396
00:17:37,077 --> 00:17:39,162
But he never got his story
straight with Pheasant.

397
00:17:39,204 --> 00:17:40,455
Which is why
Pheasant didn't know

398
00:17:40,497 --> 00:17:42,248
about the coffee, right?

399
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,668
Dog hadn't planned on hiding
a corpse before the show,

400
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:45,960
so he was in a hurry.

401
00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:48,797
He stashed Momotaro's body and
dressed in his clothes to trick

402
00:17:48,838 --> 00:17:51,800
his bandmates into thinking
they all made it to the baths.

403
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:52,926
Hold the phone.

404
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:54,761
He knew Pheasant
did it, didn't he?

405
00:17:54,803 --> 00:17:56,429
Would Dog really be willing
to take a murder rap

406
00:17:56,471 --> 00:17:57,847
to protect his bandmate?

407
00:17:57,889 --> 00:18:00,016
Well, I'm not gonna
claim that I'm a psychic.

408
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:01,226
But if you ask me‐‐

409
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:03,269
[DOG] I couldn't let a musical
mind like Pheasant's rot

410
00:18:03,311 --> 00:18:04,771
in jail over this.

Even before this band,

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,785
I always knew how
talented you were.

416
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:20,912
When we were kids, your songs
are what kept me going

417
00:18:20,954 --> 00:18:22,664
through all the bullying.

418
00:18:22,706 --> 00:18:26,126
The music you created was
the only good thing in my life.

419
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:27,794
That's so sad.

420
00:18:27,836 --> 00:18:30,296
[DOG] Pheasant never
meant to kill anybody,

421
00:18:30,338 --> 00:18:32,716
and Momotaro was
a bully and a crook!

The world is better off
with him dead! So‐‐

Pheasant. Forgive me.

[PHEASANT] What's to forgive?
Thank you, Dog, for everything.

with getting ready
your first big rock show?

Uh. One thing I don't get.

451
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,716
How come he's so into rakugo?

452
00:19:56,758 --> 00:19:58,426
It's practically an obsession.

453
00:19:58,468 --> 00:19:59,469
"Practically?"

454
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:02,055
Sherlock wanted to be
a rakugo performer.

455
00:20:02,096 --> 00:20:03,765
I guess he still does.

456

[gasps]
He does, really?

That's right. It's too bad.

458
00:20:07,393 --> 00:20:09,771
Apparently, his rakugo
master gave up on him.

459
00:20:11,773 --> 00:20:14,359
In fact, the first time
I ever met Sherlock,

460
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,821
he was doing rakugo.
In the middle of an empty park.

461
00:20:18,863 --> 00:20:21,908
[SHERLOCK]
Wait. I beg of you!

462
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,327
Just slow down a bit so that
I can match your pace.

If you keep walking
so quickly, I can't catch up!

00:20:26,913 --> 00:20:28,623
I can't slow down for you.

465
00:20:28,665 --> 00:20:31,459
I am in a most terrible hurry!

466
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:32,544
[sighs]

467
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:35,505
[clapping]

468
00:20:35,547 --> 00:20:36,506
[SHERLOCK gasps]

469
00:20:36,548 --> 00:20:38,883
[MORIARTY] That was
"The Living Koheiji," wasn't it?

470
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:42,262
I recognize that tempo and
the way you set your pauses.

471
00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:43,555
Master Koyoru.

472
00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:46,099
You must have studied
his performance.

473
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,392
[gasps]

474
00:20:50,186 --> 00:20:52,856
That certainly was
an interesting story.

475
00:20:52,897 --> 00:20:55,775
So does that mean you're
big into rakugo as well?

476
00:20:55,817 --> 00:20:57,819
I honestly don't know
a whole lot about it,

477
00:20:57,861 --> 00:21:00,363
except maybe the basic stuff
that I picked up in school.

478
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:01,447
You sure?

479
00:21:01,489 --> 00:21:03,992
It was still enough for you
to become friends, right?

480
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:05,159
We're not friends.

481
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:07,495
Uh. In that case, what are you?

482
00:21:07,537 --> 00:21:08,913
‐‐We're best friends.
‐‐We're nothing.

483
00:21:08,955 --> 00:21:10,039
[growls]

484
00:21:10,081 --> 00:21:12,041
Aw, there's no need to be shy.

485
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,167
[SHERLOCK]
Who's being shy?

486
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:15,003
‐‐[MORIARTY] For life!
‐‐[SHERLOCK] Drop dead.

487
00:21:15,044 --> 00:21:16,129
[MORIARTY]
I know you don't mean that.

488
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,463
[SHERLOCK]
Yes, I do.

489
00:21:17,505 --> 00:21:20,258
[WATSON] I think I get it.
You can stop now.

490
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,260
Today was a
real blast, you guys.

491
00:21:22,302 --> 00:21:24,220
Also, thank you for the milk.

492
00:21:24,262 --> 00:21:25,471
[WATSON]
Oh...

493
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:28,808
[MORIARTY] You turn in
the bottles. Get with it.

494
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,353
Huh? Wait. You drank it,
turn it in yourself!

495
00:21:32,395 --> 00:21:34,480
Bye, Sherlock, I'll be
seeing you again soon!

496
00:21:34,522 --> 00:21:35,857
You, too, Watson!

497
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:38,234
Uh... 'Kay. Bye.

498
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,490
[WATSON]
Actually, uh...

499
00:21:44,532 --> 00:21:45,700
[coughs]

500
00:21:45,742 --> 00:21:47,994
I thought of something that
had slipped my mind.

501
00:21:48,036 --> 00:21:50,788
This one time, I did
an autopsy on a Kintaro‐‐

502
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,373
[SHERLOCK] Turns out
the killer was a black bear.

503
00:21:52,415 --> 00:21:53,708
Uh.

504
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:03,635
Step one: Create a distraction
to throw them off guard!

505
00:22:03,676 --> 00:22:04,719
[KIDS]
Distraction!

506
00:22:04,761 --> 00:22:06,220
Don't look
the target in the eye.

507
00:22:06,262 --> 00:22:08,014
Drop your hips and aim low!

508
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:09,599
‐‐Aim low!
‐‐[GROUP] Aim low!

509
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:10,600
Aim low!

510
00:22:10,642 --> 00:22:12,727
[KIDS]
Aim low! Aim low!

511
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:15,605
[MORIARTY] Running
pickpocketing drills again?

512
00:22:15,647 --> 00:22:16,814
Hi, Boss!

513
00:22:16,856 --> 00:22:18,441
[KIDS]
Hey, Boss!

514
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:19,817
So how'd it go?

515
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:21,235
What's that Watson guy's deal?

516
00:22:21,277 --> 00:22:23,613
Is he clean?
Who's he working for?

517
00:22:23,655 --> 00:22:27,158
[MORIARTY] Eh. He's not
too sharp or tough or cool.

518
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,826
[gasping]

519
00:22:28,868 --> 00:22:30,578
Heh.

520
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,207
But besides that, I don't
think he's a bad guy.

521
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:08,634
[LUCY] I feel kind of bad
that I'm always leaving

522
00:24:08,676 --> 00:24:10,053
the cooking to you.

523
00:24:10,094 --> 00:24:11,929
[MARY] Well, you shouldn't‐‐
it's no bother.
