1
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,852
Now that Jack's found
out where you live,

2
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:21,813
it isn't safe for you to
continue staying there anymore.

3
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:25,901
You need to hide.

4
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,903
Stay off the grid
for a little while.

5
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,238
And I'll go with you.

6
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,865
I'd be happy to serve as
your personal bodyguard.

7
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,535
Nobody would dare lay a hand
on you with me around!

8
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,453
And anyone who tried would
find themselves dead

9
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,247
where they stood!

10
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,207
Hmm?

[screams]
Blood! It's touching me!

12

[WATSON] Could you please try
to take this seriously, you two?

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,130
Stop freaking out, Doctor.

14
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,424

take care of herself.

Hmm! Maybe it would be
best if you stayed

18
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,932
with Sherlock for a while.

Hah! Like hell it would!

21

I am not allowing that
blue‐eyed demon into my room!

and his family name was Ando...

Oh, dear. You fried
his poor little brain.

28
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,159
Okay. I can't
deny that Sherlock

29
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,704
does brilliant work
as a detective,

30
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,747
but he's not the bodyguard type.

31
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,374
What, didn't you know?

32
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,835
He's also a master
of the art of baritsu.

33
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,921
What is that?
I've never heard of baritsu.

34
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,756
He's a baritsu master?

35
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,342
Shocking. I didn't know.

36
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,928
So is that like a big deal?

37
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,806
[FUYUTO]
It's the biggest deal.

38
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,475
Or so they say, at least.

39
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,269

[WATSON]
Uhh...

00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,069
Well, Doctor. It's time
for you to get packing.

44
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,196
Remember, it's all
for Irene's sake.

45
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,198
You're welcome to stay
here in the bar for a while,

46
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,325
so let's go.

I getting kicked out?!

"Give back the egg"?

51
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,083
And what egg would that be?

52
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,713
He's talking about
the fried‐egg USB drive.

53
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,381
From that one case?

54
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,467
Yes, Moran's mystery drive.

55
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,844
Jack is coming after me because
he has no way of knowing

56
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,388
that Sherlock has it now.

57
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,806
But I thought
you gave the egg back

58
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,642
to Mycroft in the end.

59
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,185
Not quite.

60
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,356
[SHERLOCK] I gave him
the dummy drive instead.

61
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:38,533
Whatever's on this drive
should give us a clue...

62
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,327
...to Jack's identity.

63
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,301

on the password.

78
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,668
I'm not that interested in
what's on the drive.

79
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,128
But you know that Jack is,

and you want to use
it as bait, right?

Could I borrow
the bath for a little bit?

doing the cleaning,

use the facilities.

00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:21,209
But it'll be much more fun
if you do it with me.

Oh, stop!

00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,761
You're such a funny
guy, Mr. Kyogoku!

168
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:35,098
[FUYUTO laughs]
Just making conversation.

169
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,433
Ahh...

170
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,060
How I wish that I could
find a sweetheart like you

171
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,937
to be my boyfriend.

172
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,147
Silly, right?

173
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,398
Actually...

174
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,443
I know a special place that
I'd really like to show you.

175
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,950
[MAKI gasps]
Oh, my darling.

176
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,411
I'll be by your side
until the very end!

the two of them set off

into the moonlit"...
What am I even reading?

179
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,961
My plan for our
first date, of course.

180
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,881
You might talk like this,

181
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,550
but when it comes
to Maki, I'm not so sure.

182
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:14,012
Well, obviously there
are variables to consider.

183
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,141
[FUYUTO] And that is why
I've run enough simulations

184
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,518
to account for every
last one of them!

185

The battle is won before
the first spear is raised!

186
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,648
You've certainly put
some thought into this.

what's going on with you?

195
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,456
[CHINKILL]
So there's this new guy, right?

196
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,957
[FUYUTO]
Ms. Maki Hokari!

197
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:43,958
Yes?

198
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,752
Um... I was hoping
that I could maybe

199
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,754
have a talk with you
about me and you and us

200
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,130
doing some things together?

201
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,131
[MAKI]
Hmm?

202
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,966
Things like, um, you know.

203
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,718
Just normal adult‐type things.

204
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,888
Like getting martinis together,
and then taking the party back

205
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,223
to the hotel room.

206
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,808
And then you start getting
embarrassed when I go

207
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,934
That's nice.

208
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,393
I'll be going now
if you don't mind.

209
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,479
If you're wondering,
he was hoping to ask you out

210
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,480
on a date.

211
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,775
[FUYUTO] That's right! I wanted
to ask you out on a date!

00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,693
But you‐‐

[MARY] FYI, the guy's
got piles of money.

00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,159
Just thought you'd wanna know.

217
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,748
We can go anywhere you want!

Yeah! My plan is a success!

What are you doing here, lady?

230
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,701
[IRENE] I'm stacking shogi tiles
and hiding from Jack the Ripper.

231
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,162
Well, looks like
I win this round!

Ah. Is that so.

which one to get.

This is a problem.

Ah!

00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,851
I just can't decide.

00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,728
I think I need them all!

Right! Then that's
what you'll get!

You're that guy from the bar.

Why are you always hanging
out here by the playground?

[WATSON]
Where I choose to go and why

244
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,287
is none of your business.

00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,291
Don't take my picture!

Who are you calling sketchy?

you are eating cup noodles

on a park bench,
but there's good news!

252

I got some tickets
to a rakugo show.

Wanna go? You, me, and Sherlock.

I'm in.

[MORIARTY]
You dummy. What now?

256
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,982
There's only three tickets.

257
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,735
Sorry, but there's no way
we can leave her alone.

258
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,238
Could you please hurry this up?

259
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,156
Oh, don't worry about me.

It's an emergency!

Go on without me!

I hope everything's okay.

00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,309
Right. Now then, Doctor.

00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,478
We are running late!

00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,688
Uh...

00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,335
Do you think it was him?

Jack did this.

Ugh. The kitchen, too?

279
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,347
Did he find the drive?

00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,854
Clearly, it's not
safe here anymore.

282
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,982
What now? I've got
nowhere left to hide.

283
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,233

You can use this.

Hey, can I take this off yet?

285

No, you can't.

We don't know who's
watching us right now.

288
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,044
You need to
disappear for a while.

289
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,087
Keep the mask on.

290
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,423
Will she really
be safe where we're going?

291
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,133
He already found her twice.

292
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,469
Boss Kaneko recommended it,

293
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,512
and he knows how
to keep things hidden.

294
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,224
[SHERLOCK] It's an
old abandoned movie theater

295
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,603
that the Kaneko family
used to operate.

296
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,979
The boss himself hides out here

297
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,731
when there's
a gang war going on.

298

The three of us are
the only ones who know

299
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,236
that Irene is hiding here.

300
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,365
Let's keep it that way.
Don't tell anybody.

301

My lips are sealed.

[IRENE] Hmm!
The boss is well prepared.

303

[SHERLOCK] You'll have
no problem getting by

with what you have on hand here.

305

[IRENE]
Thank you both.

306
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,587
I've put you two
through a lot of trouble.

307
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,839
That said, could I
ask you to go pick up

308
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,633
a few more things for me?

[SHERLOCK]
Damn that woman.

310
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,262
These things are not needs.

311
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,347
Well...

312
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,557
I don't mind doing the
shopping if you don't want to.

313
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,268
It's fine. I can do it.

314
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,646
Okay. But why?

315
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,606
Wouldn't it make
more sense to split up?

316
00:14:58,648 --> 00:14:59,732
[SHERLOCK]
I've got it.

[WATSON grunts, gasps]

318

[WATSON]
I'm not useless, you know?

319
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,370
But he treats me like an idiot.
