1
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,642
[MYCROFT] Then you're granting
me full discretion to act,

2
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,101
Ward Mayor Moran?

3
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:21,522
That's correct.

4
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,566
You're to return this item
to me, whatever it takes.

5
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,443
[MYCROFT]
Understood, sir.

6
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:28,654
Do you have any leads as
to who may have taken it?

7
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,036
She's the culprit?

8
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,955
The woman's brilliant,
beautiful, and cunning

9
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,374
as a snake,
but with half the charm

10
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,251
and not a bit of the warmth.

11
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,711
Irene Adler is our thief.

12
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,884
[WATSON sighs] I'm glad we
could find your trading cards.

13
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,679
Though the one‐per‐customer
limit did throw me a little bit.

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,013
What's the deal there?

15
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,432
Are those things really
that hard to get?

16
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,433
[SHERLOCK]
Yeah.

17
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,435
This whole line of cards
has gone out of print.

18
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,354
And after I've found
Master Koyoru's card,

19
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,772
I'll have a complete set!

20
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:07,442
[giggles]

21
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,446
[WATSON]
Oh, hey. Mr. Kobayashi!

22
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:15,367
Ah? Ha! Didn't think I'd
be seeing you two at this hour!

23
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,494
There was an early
bird sale this morning.

24
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,038
[SHERLOCK] So what are all these
people standing around for?

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,707
For the latest A.I!

26
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,001
The day has finally come!

27
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,838
It's time to unveil mankind's
bridge into the future.

28
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,090
Allow me to introduce you
to the newest generation

29
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:33,719
of the Real Wife:
Airi, version 6.9!

30
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,265
[CROWD cheers]

31
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,850
Don't be shy, honey.

32
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,144
Go on and introduce yourself
to the whole world.

33
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,354
I love you, darling.

34
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,440
‐‐[CROWD] Yeah!
‐‐[GODFREY] Today is the future!

35
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,734
[CROWD]
Future!

36
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,444
[KOBAYASHI]
Future!

37
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,945
You guys are out of the loop.

38
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:55,032
She's A.I, or Airi for short,
and she's so totally perfect

39
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:58,869
that every new version sells out
immediately on launch day!

40
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,870
[WATSON, KOBAYASHI]
Uh?

41
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,330
[SHERLOCK]
You'll need these.

42
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,540
You're the best,
Sherlock, thanks!

43
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,125
[giggles]

44
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,377
[SHERLOCK]
Koyoru, Koyoru, Koyoru, Koyoru.

45
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,629
Come on, Koyoru!

46
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,881
Tss! Aww...

47
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,383
What would he want with
all those tissues you gave him?

48
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,137
Come on. Give me Koyoru!

49
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,640
Koyoru. Koyoru. Koyoru.

50
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,724
[gasps]

51
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,020
[SHERLOCK]
Ahh‐‐!

52
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,313
[whimpers]

53
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,981
[WATSON groans]

54
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,485
[WATSON] Seriously, what's
he going to be wiping up?

55
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,487
[SHERLOCK]
Seriously. Google it, ya virgin.

56
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,198
Ah! That's rude,
and way off base.

57
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,491
Ah.

58
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,451
Been waiting for you, boys.

59
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,498
[HUDSON] This is the
biggest one in a while,

60
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,875
so I'm expecting
everyone to want in.

61
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,712
[WATSON] Ah, so that
does happen sometimes.

62
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,465
Though I think Mr. Kobayashi
is still in line.

63
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,217
[MYCROFT] Then we're going
to have to start without him.

64
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,469
[SHERLOCK gasps]
Pass on this one.

65
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,346
[MYCROFT] Surely you
can hear me out at least.

66
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,807
Isn't that fair, little brother?

67
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:02,808
[gasping]

68
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,017
[growls]

69
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,312
[SHERLOCK]
Mycroft...

70
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,480
[MYCROFT]
Hmm.

71
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,776
[MYCROFT] Here on the dark
streets of Kabukicho,

72
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,820
where the trumpeting of
elephants rings in the hour

73
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,990
and evil lurks in every
shadow, six detectives roam.

74
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,993
Freaks, geeks, losers,
and loons to a one.

75
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,788
Where they roam,
chaos will surely follow.

76
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,415
And you fine people
are invited to watch

77
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,875
their wild war of
wills and wits.

78
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,679
Brothers, huh?

79
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,390
Yes, that's correct.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

80
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,519
My name is Mycroft.
I'm Sherlock's older brother.

81
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,270
[FUYUTO] To think
that such an important man

82
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,314
could share genes
with that weirdo.

83
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,982
‐‐[MYCROFT] Who are you?
‐‐[FUYUTO] I'm Kyogoku Fuyuto...

84
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,317
So he's a big deal?

85
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,612
Ah. Yeah. He says
he's Ward Mayor Moran's

86
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,697
top secretary.

87
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,116
By the way, here's something
to sweeten the pot.

88
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,828
[gasping]

89
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,413
So what is that, and why
am I supposed to care?

90
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,707
Apologies. Just a small extra.

91
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,126
[SHERLOCK whimpers]

92
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,586
[MYCROFT chuckles]

93
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,046
This is an S Rank with bonus,

94
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,173
and you're looking at a
payout of 15,000,000 yen

95
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,341
plus the trading card.

96
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,801
[gasping]

97
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,302
Well, Mikey‐dear.

98
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,012
Why don't you fill us in?

99
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,514
[MYCROFT]
Right, then.

100
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,017
I'm hiring you all
to retrieve a stolen item.

101
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,104
Namely, a USB memory stick
belonging to Mayor Moran,

102
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,523
which looks like this.

103
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,524
[FUYUTO]
A fried egg?

104
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,693
[MARY]
Are you serious right now?

105
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,987
Who would buy that?

106
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,905
It disappeared two weeks ago.

107
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,449
It would seem that someone
stole the mayor's USB stick

108
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,034
while he was asleep.

109
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,537
Shortly thereafter,
the mayor received an email

110
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,789
from the culprit threatening
to publish its contents

111
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:16,001
unless he paid an
exorbitantly high ransom.

112
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,461
The blackmailer
is this woman, Irene Adler.

113
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,754
[MARY]
I know her.

114
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,257
She's been a commentator
on TV before, right?

115
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:25,093
She's a renowned expert
in both education and finance.

116
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,511
A violin virtuoso, too.

117
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,389
A true renaissance woman
with endless talent and drive!

118
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,892
And how do you know
this woman is our thief?

119
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,393
Access, for one thing.

120
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,729
She previously worked in
the Moran family's employ

121
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,147
as a private tutor.

122
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,315
Huh...

123
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,066
Of course, and I'm
sure that an affair

124
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:44,029
was involved as well right?
What's on the drive anyway?

125
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,072
[MYCROFT] Something that
can't be allowed to get out.

126
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,116
That's as much as I can say.

127
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,911
We're keeping this away
from the police for a reason.

128
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:54,539
So a past relationship
and a drive full of secret data.

129
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,749
From what you've told us,

130
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,627
revenge porn sounds
like a safe bet.

131
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,795
[MYCROFT sighs]
As has been mentioned,

132
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,006
this woman is
also quite brilliant.

133
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,051
We've consulted with numerous
detectives and even criminals,

134
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,136
and she's made a fool
of each one to date.

135
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,180
[gasps]

136
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,806
[MYCROFT]
Hmm.

137
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,851
[SHERLOCK] Hmph. Give her what
she wants and be done with it.

138
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,853
Three hundred million
yen is a lot of money.

139
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:17,896
‐‐[gasping]
‐‐[MICHEL] Wow.

140
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,522
And assuming
we can produce that sum,

141
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,567
it still doesn't guarantee that
she would return the drive.

142
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,070
What's more, she could
easily have duplicated the data

143
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,071
by this point, couldn't she?

144
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,906
Fortunately,
that's not a concern.

145
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,617
The files on this drive
are impossible to copy.

146
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,535
One more
important point to note.

147
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,747
Miss Adler will be moving out of
her house a few days from now.

148
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,582
So do be aware that
you'll be working under

149
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,334
a tight deadline on this case.

150
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,045
I take it that's
all for the explanation.

151
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,171
Ugh...

152
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,422
What's going on?

153
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,383
The Missus seems
kind of down today.

154
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,135
[LUCY] Hmm. She does,
now that you mention it.

155
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,345
[HUDSON]
Hmm.

156
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,806
[sighs]

157
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,310
I leave it to you,
my dearest little brother.

158
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,979
[SHERLOCK]
Ugh.

159
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,730
You seem interested, Doctor.

160
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:01,940
Feel free to take my place.

161
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,901
Ah! Hold on. Why me?

162
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,903
Just go.

163
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,990
After the sun has set
upon all the rest of the world,

164
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,535
our little town of Kabukicho
blah, blah‐bblah, blah‐blah.

165
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,912
If gold and silver
are what you're after,

166
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:19,040
then track down the mayor's
dick pic memory stick.

167
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,167
A light gleams
in these detectives' eyes.

168
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,670
This is a haven for
outcasts and oddballs,

169
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:27,173
and you're the reason they call
it "the Detectives' Row House."

170
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,303
Fifteen million yen
to whoever is able to secure

171
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,264
Mayor Moran's USB key drive.

172
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,932
[pop]

173
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,271
It should be somewhere close.

174
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,567
[MARY grunts]
Hey!

175
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,736
[LUCY] C'mon, we didn't
even do anything!

176
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,279
Watch the hands, creep!

177
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,739
[LUCY growls]

178
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:58,747
[police siren wails]

179
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,959
That must be the place.

180
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,970
‐‐[OLD MAN groans]
‐‐[MAID 7A] Ahh!

181
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,723
Oh, no! Hold on, sir, I'll
call a doctor right away!

182
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,850
[gasps]
What's wrong?

183
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,061
[MAID 7A] He was walking along
and suddenly collapsed!

184
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,896
[WATSON] Stay with me,
sir, it'll be okay.

185
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,481
Are you in any pain?

186
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,232
Ah. Ah!

187
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,319
Please, calm down, sir.
I'm a doctor, I can help.

188
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,071
[IRENE]
What's going on here?

189
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,164
[OLD MAN] I suffer from acute
compartment syndrome, miss.

190
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,833
May I please rest inside while
I wait for an ambulance?

191
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,503
Wait. Compartment syndrome's
making you spit blood?

192
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,798
[IRENE]
Hmm. Johnny. Hakamada.

193
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,841
You're an absolute
embarrassment.

194
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,600
‐‐[GUARD 7A] Come on, get up.
‐‐[FUYUTO] I regret everything!

195
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:01,935
[GUARD 7A]
Walk!

196
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,313
Bring him inside.

197
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,524
The doctor here will
be needing a new shirt.

198
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,235
‐‐Huh...? Ah!
‐‐Yes, understood, ma'am.

199
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,694
Follow me, please.

200
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,369
[WATSON]
Of course. Thank you, miss!

201
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,669
Pink, huh? Nice.

202
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,753
[LEAD MOVER]
Beg your pardon, ma'am.

203
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,004
[MOVERS]
Excuse us!

204
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,132
Sorry, but we have
to pat you down.

205
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,722
[LEAD MOVER] Will we be
packing everything for you?

206
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,641
We can take care
of whatever you need.

207
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,685
[IRENE] Don't touch anything
in the back room upstairs,

208
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,564
I'll deal with that myself.
But go ahead and pack the rest.

209
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,982
[LEAD MOVER]
Understood.

210
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,194
The back room upstairs, huh?

211
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:58,908
It's locked.

212
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,494
[GODFREY]
This way.

213
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:05,498
Yes, I'm going to be departing
for New York City tomorrow.

214
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,001
Uh! U‐Um, hi.

215
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,919
Ah, you must be the doctor!

216
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,130
I was hoping that I might
run into you here.

217
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,381
Yes, sir.

218
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,884
Ah. And you're the one
who makes those dolls!

219
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,303
Then you're familiar
with my Real Wives?

220
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,640
Godfrey Norton. It's a pleasure.

221
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,475
And I'm John Wa‐‐

222

223
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,563
[GODFREY]
Hmm...

224
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,106
Heh, heh...

225
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,192
Doctor Kobayashi Johnwa.

226
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,944
May I ask you to lend me
your expertise for a bit?

227
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,237
[gasps]

228
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:42,202
[WATSON] Hmm. You might consider
offering multiple options

229
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,913
for thickness and
elasticity of skin.

230
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,040
Maybe a range of resting
body temperatures?

231
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,541
Excellent thoughts!

232
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,919
Only a true professional
could hold such insights

233
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,837
‐‐into the human body!
‐‐[WATSON] One thing here.

234
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,756
This seems just a bit off to me.

235
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,924
[GODFREY]
Fantastic!

236
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,134
Now that you mention it,
it does, doesn't it?

237
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,511
[laughs]

238
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,222
You're a sharp one.

239
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,807
I think I need to get your eyes
on my unannounced line

240
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,059
of new ladies!

241
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,310
[WATSON]
Hmm?

242
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,104
[AIRI]
I love you.

243
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,481
[AIRI]
Ti amo.

244
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,067
[GODFREY] The Real Wife
is going international.

245
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,861
And tomorrow, these Airi World
Models begin their journeys

246
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,154
across the globe!

247
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,530
It's my great undertaking:

248
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,742
to offer my Airi, the perfect
wife, to men of every nation.

249
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,161
[WATSON] Is your real, er,
your actual wife going?

250
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,829
Yes. But for the moment,

251
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,290
I'll be leaving her to
take care of our new house.

252
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,209
And I'll be taking
the Airis here‐‐

Dear? There you are.

00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,879
What are you doing?

255
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,422
[GODFREY]
Hello, honey! Heh.

256
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,633
I was asking our new friend
Johnwa for his opinions

257
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,884
on the World Models.

258
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,220
[IRENE] You were also showing
off an unannounced project

‐‐to the movers, dear.
‐‐[GODFREY] Ah!

260
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,349
I suppose I was. My apologies.

00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:49,143
Let's get you to work
taking care of the trash.

262
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,436
Follow me.

263
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,729
[IRENE chuckles]

264
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,444
Ma'am. Will you need us
to pack this room?

265
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,696
[IRENE]
No, thanks.

266
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,490
These are Godfrey's babies
and he's terribly protective.

267
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,450
He told me that he would
prefer to pack and load

268
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,785
each one personally.

269
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,329
[LEAD MOVER]
Understood. Well, then.

270
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,498
Sorry for taking up
so much of your time.

271
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,959
No. Mr. Norton
seems like a great husband.

272
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,836
He's not my husband yet.

273
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,421
Ah. I wasn't aware!

274
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,423
‐‐[crashing]
‐‐[BOTH] Ah.

[pager meowing, buzzing]

277
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,977
Wait, what French girl?

00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,145
[gasps]

279
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,523
[AIRI]
Je t'aime.

280
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:42,238
[speaking French]

281
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,833
Today is the future!

282
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,793
[AIRI]
Voulez‐vous coucher avec moi?

283
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,797
[WATSON gasps]

284
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,717
[SHERLOCK] Get in the truck,
Doctor Johnwa Kobayashi.

285
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,302
[WATSON]
Sherlock!

286
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,804
Guess I'm not as useless
as you thought, am I?

287
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,264
Don't get ahead of yourself.

288
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,980
Fortunately, Kyogoku
is staggeringly incompetent.

289
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,690
How did you know?

290
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,400
Ah...

291
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,319
You bugged me?!

292
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,613
So that's why
you had me go ahead.

293
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,282
But how did you get a mover's
uniform and a van?

294
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,450
[SHERLOCK]
That was the easiest part.

295
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,952
I just handed a wad of bills
to the movers' boss.

296
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,039
It was nothing next to the
card‐‐ Uh, cold hard cash

297
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,832
I'll be getting
out of this case.

298
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,090
[WATSON]
That Irene was gorgeous, though.

299
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,383
[SHERLOCK]
Was she?

300
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,552
[WATSON] How did you know where
that USB drive was, anyway?

301
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,305
[SHERLOCK] Tch. Clearly,
Doctor Johnwa Kobayashi

302
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,306
is no detective.

303
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,808
Let that go already!

304
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:52,934
[yawns]

305
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,896
[FUYUTO] Ugh! Irene. I swear I'm
coming for that drive tomorrow!

306
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,315
You wish!
Not if I get to it first, kid.

307
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,608
Wanna make a bet?

308
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,652
Oh, please, you still
haven't even met the woman!

309
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,071
[laughter]

310
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,573
[FUYUTO growls]
They're so obnoxious.

311
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,742
Anyway, wanna, like, sneak off?

312
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:11,994
[MAKI]
Mm?

313
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,208
[FUYUTO gasps]

314
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,419
[SHERLOCK]
Hmm. Hmm!

315
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,546
Are you practicing your
goofy‐looking faces?

316
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,215
Why would I practice?
I'm deducting.

317
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,509
Obviously the USA‐whatever
thing has to be

318
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,136
in the bedroom, doesn't it?

319
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,347
Ugh. Good job.
Now can you narrow it down?

320
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,141
There are lots of hiding
spots in a bedroom.

321
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,518
Yep! and it's definitely
in one of 'em!

322
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,853
That's as far as you got?

323
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,106
Sorry to tell you, but you
haven't deduced anything.

324
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,899
Although, I didn't have
to deduce anything

325
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,234
either this time.

326
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,944
She told me herself
where to find it.

327
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,904
‐‐Huh?!
‐‐It's simple.

328
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,365
When I asked if she wanted the
movers to pack up that room,

329
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,200
she said to leave it, and
that Godfrey intended

330
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,744
to pack up all the Airis
and load them individually.

331
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,414
Seems like a strange answer.

332
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,999
Were they the
only things in that room

333
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,542
that needed to be moved?

334
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,294
Nah, there was
furniture and paintings

335
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,463
‐‐and all kinds of stuff!
‐‐Right.

336
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,423
But she responded like
I asked her specifically

337
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,049
about packing the dolls.

338
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,968
She was so focused
on where she hid that drive

339
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,803
that she answered
the wrong question.

340
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,472
Oh, hey, you're right!

341
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,057
But that guy had a robo‐wife
for every day of the week!

342
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,642
And anyone could
have had the whatsit,

343
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,896
so how'd you figure
it was the French girl?

344
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,523
That's the easiest
question you've asked yet.

345
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,025
Each doll was going
to be shipped out

346
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,319
to a different country,
with the husband following along

347
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,279
after them, but that
doesn't quite explain

348
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,531
how the wife fit
into the whole plan.

349
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,116
I thought he said
that she was gonna be

350
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,161
‐‐moving into their new house.
‐‐He did mention that.

351
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,996
Meaning whichever one
of those dolls was going

352
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,956
to the same country as
she was, would be the one

353
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,125
hiding the drive.

354
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,669
Oh, right! And the tag
on the wife's suitcase

355
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,714
said it was headed
for somewhere in France!

356
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,091
So, then, nothing
left to do but plug it in

357
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,093
and see what's inside.

358
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,680
But I figure there's probably
going to be a password.

359
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,641
Only one way to find out!

360
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,892
There's a lesson in this.

361
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,353
What does a secret thumb drive
holding all your homemade porn

362
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,771
have in common
with an ultra‐rare

363
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,773

trading card?

364
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,775
Why don't ya tell us?!

365
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,985
You don't want
someone else getting it.

366
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,946
And that's all
our time for today.

00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,883
Hey, where are you going?!

00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,680
Hold on. What is this?

375
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,600
She was onto us the whole time?

[WATSON]

377
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,773
We never had her fooled.

Irene knew everything
from the start!

379

Yeah. That was not the drive
we were looking for.

[DRUNK 7B guffaws] Kinda early
in the night for that!

again, Mister Sherlock Holmes.

[SHERLOCK]
What are you doing here?

388

Ugh. You two are
ruining the ambience.

This is exactly why
I didn't want this case.

[IRENE] Ah. Good evening
to you too, Doctor Watson.

Wait. Is it
Doctor Kobayashi now?

Or Johnwa?

I'm sorry to tell you all, but
the real flash drive has already

made its way to
Paris ahead of me.

400

And with that...

401

...I'll be going.

402
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,460
I'll drop in again if
I should find myself in Japan.

Au revoir.

[gasps]

420
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,546
You needed to hide
that data badly enough

421
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,006
that you'd make a dummy drive.

422
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,675
A woman as cautious as you
would never part with

423

something that important.

still kind enough

Yeah.

Could be a new client, I guess.

Maybe not.

We might be able
to restore the data.

If we're able to
authenticate the drive,

we'll be happy to pay in full.

In any case, you're still the
best at what you do, Sherlock.

[MYCROFT] That's done.
