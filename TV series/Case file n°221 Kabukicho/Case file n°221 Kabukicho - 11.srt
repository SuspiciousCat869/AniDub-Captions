Someone, explain.

Sorry. It was a bunch of lies.

77
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,309
She's not in any danger
as long as she's here,

78
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,646
but that doesn't get us
any closer to Jack's identity.

79
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,189
What a waste.

80
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,482
Do you have a plan, then?

81
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,651
The drive is what
Jack's really after,

82
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,486
and for all he
knows you have it.

83
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,947
I think we ought to use
that to bait him out.

84
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,199
You make that
sound rather simple.

85
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,287
[MORIARTY] First, we needed
to get Irene to a place

86
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,123
where Jack would easily
be able to attack her.

87
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,625
But at the same time,
we couldn't make it so obvious

88
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,502
that he would realize
it was a trap.

89
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,757
Ugh. The kitchen, too?

90
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,551
[MORIARTY] We needed you
to leak the information

91
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,094
so that Jack would
hear about it.

92
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,554
Did he find the drive?

93
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,476
[MORIARTY] And of course,
he showed up just as planned.

94
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,857
[MORIARTY] But he used you
as a diversion to get Sherlock

95
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,984
away from Irene.

96
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,152

Hurry up.

that Jack had caught Irene

101

and was holding
her in captivity.

Do you have anything
to say to us about that?

103
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,416

Lestrade into coming after me,

I'm sorry.

This happened because
I let my guard down.

No, it wasn't anybody's fault.

121
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,676
Jack was one step ahead of us.

122
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,720
It's a risk we all accepted
in making this plan.

123
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,847
So, where do we go from here?

I've already set
the next step in motion.

[MORIARTY]
Don't worry about it.

127
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,355
Slow down.
Don't worry about what?

128
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,190
We still have the USB drive,

129
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,985
and Watson doesn't know anything
except for what you've told him.

130
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,487
The bait is already on the hook.

131
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:13,660
Now if Irene can be dead for
a while, we can catch our fish.

132
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:14,911
[SHERLOCK sighs]

133
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,081
[MORIARTY] If Irene was dead
and Sherlock had the drive,

134
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,834
Jack would have to adjust
his strategy to a harder target,

135
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,627
meaning more chances
for him to mess up.

136
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,379
And we expected he'd
target you as his source

137
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,798
of information, which
would make it easier for us

138
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,591
to predict his next move.

139
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,677
So, we kept you in the dark,

140
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,637
knowing you'd be suspicious
of me for showing up

‐‐at the safehouse.

[MORIARTY] Anyone would,
considering the timing

143
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,727
and the fact I wasn't
supposed to know about it.

144
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,439
And then, we used your
suspicion to draw Jack in.

145
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,150
Irene put a lot of work
into her little magic show,

146
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,193
and it turned out
exactly like we hoped.

147
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,446
She had you convinced that
I was going to attack Sherlock

148
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,947
and steal the drive,

149
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,283
and we knew Jack would
figure that out quick.

150
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,035
Once he did,
his next obvious move

151
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,579
would be to manipulate you
into going to Sherlock's place

152
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,497
and taking the drive for him.

153
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,625

Please, know that Sherlock
never wanted to use you‐‐

We couldn't think of any
other way to lure Jack out.

and use their blood
to paint wings around them.

their bodies into

Angels, in other words.

What if his killings weren't
done out of hatred,

292
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,897
but rather some perverse
desire to turn the victims

293
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,607
into more perfect beings?

294
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,109
Well, if that's how it is,

295
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,277
then why'd he always take
the wombs with him and leave

the wangs rotting at the scene?

If Jack's perfect being
has no junk at all,

298

what's with the
uterus collection?

299
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,992
Here's the kicker:

300
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,953
In his mind, having
neither and having both

301
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,329
aren't much different.

302
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,248
It's having only one
that's the problem.

303
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,500
Wha‐What the hell
are you saying?

304
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,210
Jack brought his victims
closer to his idea

305
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,921
of perfection by
removing their genitals,

306
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,965
and he tried to do the same for
himself by keeping the parts

307
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,300
of them that he lacked.

308
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,052
So what does it mean
if he only kept

309
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,514
the female sex organs
and left the male ones behind?

310
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:35,935
[gasps] He didn't need the dicks
'cause he's already got one!

311
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,271
Right. Our perpetrator
is someone

312
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,274
with male sex organs,
and on top of that,

313

they're able to get Kyogoku

00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,613
What does a cheating
husband have in common

316
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,532
with an ambitious angel?

I bet you're gonna tell me!

Both of them are about
to suffer a nasty fall.

I've never hurt anyone, so why
are you saying these things?

Here's the glass
you were drinking from

346
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,532
at the Pipe Cat, and here's
the peyote Kyogoku

347
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,951
was dosed with when
he attacked Watson.

was an aphrodisiac.

And of course, pure as he was,

355
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,637
Kyogoku held onto the pills as
a memento from his first night

00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,013
with the woman he loved.

won't let you admit defeat.
