00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,989
...on a sumo wrestler.

76
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,658
[WATSON] I don't think
I had any idea that there was

77
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,952
a sumo stable there until today.

78
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,913
[KOBAYASHI] Yeah,
it's called the Kuromi Stable.

79
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,165
I've heard a little bit
about 'em, but honestly,

80
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,667
none of it has been good.

00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,378
That so.

82
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,297
Apparently, this one goes
by the name "Omiyama."

83
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,634
Really? It's been quite a while
since I've heard that name.

84
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,803
As I recall, he was expected
to become a yokozuna

85
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,721
when he was younger.

86
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,889
[MICHEL]
Phoo.

87
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,225
At one time, but that's
ancient history.

88
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,228
He had a bad knee injury
and was never the same again.

89
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,231
He barely even wrestled
in the last tournament.

90
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,357
Hmm.

00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,401

So he's over the hill now.

[HUDSON]
He may not win much anymore,

93
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,613
but according to all their
neighbors, he's the only man

94
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,199
out of the whole Kuromi
Stable with a decent heart.

95

That's all fine and good.

96
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,454
I'd say it's more his brain
that's the problem, though.

Seriously, what a boring
way to end a career.

Uh?

00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,793
[MICHEL] If he loses
this next tournament,

100
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,546
he gets knocked
down to makushita. Huh.

101
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:24,134
Considering his age, that might
be enough to push him to retire.

102
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,303
I bet that's why

‐‐Hey, wait. Don't I know you?

162

[LUCY]
Here you go.

163
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,909
[BUNMARU]
Thank you very much, miss.

164
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,704
So, who is this? You know him?

165
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:01,624
Not really. We just
ran into each other recently.

166
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,835
That's right.
My name is Bunmaru,

167
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,046
a wrestler from the
Kuromi sumo stable,

168
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,881
and Omiyama's attendant.

169
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,508
Huh. What were
you doing up here?

170
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,552
I mean, other than scaring Lucy.

171
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,721
[BUNMARU]
That's a long story.

172
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,806
You see, our building hasn't
been in the best shape

173
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,517
for awhile now, and
we recently decided it was

174
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,020
finally time to make
some long‐needed repairs.

175
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,521
[LUCY]
Yeah, makes sense.

176
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,649
That building is just
about falling apart. Go on.

177
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,942
Well, last night...

178
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,029
...I was given two million yen
collected by our supporters

179
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,990
to put toward
renovating the stable.

180
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,160
But then I got drunk and
now all the money is gone!

181
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,536
Two million yen?

182
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,746
That's not good.

183
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,748
Maybe we shouldn't
have interrupted you.

184
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,750
[BUNMARU] The contractors
are asking for the money

185
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,127
by noon today,
and the only way I can pay

186
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,379
this debt is with my life,
so please don't interfere!

187
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,631
[LUCY]
That's not gonna help!

188
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,050
If you kill yourself it'll only
make things worse for Omiyama,

189
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,593
so knock it off!

190
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,428
But there's no way
I can ever show my face

191
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,180
at the stable again!

192
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,682
‐‐[LUCY growls]
‐‐[BUNMARU] Uh?

193
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,393
What's this? Where
did you get all this money?

194
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,478
It's yours.

195
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,147
[BUNMARU] That's very
generous, but I can't accept.

196
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,358
Y'already did. Take it and go.

197
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,070
Ah... Ah! I shall be
forever in your debt, miss!

198
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,198
[panting]

199
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,991
Why did I do that?!

200
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,743
Forgive me, Mary!

201
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,454
[MORIARTY]
Mary? I get it.

202
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,124
So what expensive thing
is she asking for now?

203
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,959
I think your life would be
a lot easier if you could

204
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,627
learn to tell her no.

205
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,463
Yeah. I know that she
can be selfish sometimes,

206
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,341
and that I shouldn't give in...

207
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,177
...but she's my sister,
the only one I've got.

208
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,304
[MORIARTY grunts]

209
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,765
[LUCY]
You understand, don't you?

210
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,809
Since you've got a sister, too.

211
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,686
Yeah, I get it.

212
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:48,189
That's why... I'll make it work,
one way or another!

213
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:56,739
[KANEKO] Certainly,
another two million yen.

214
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,825
But I would like to
make it perfectly clear to you

215
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,743
that your due date
remains the same.

216
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,620
Do you accept those terms?

217
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,372
I can make that work.

218
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,874
Four million in two weeks!

219
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,209
I'll pay you back,
whatever it takes!

220
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,922
[MARY sighs, yawns]

221
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,008
Crap. I didn't mean to sleep in.

222
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,182
[gasps]
Oh, Lucy!

223
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,310
[HUDSON] You're looking for
any work you can get, you say?

224
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,978
I've got A‐rank jobs piling up,

225
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,606
you're more than welcome
to pull some off the stack.

226
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,733
Can I really? Thank you!

227
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,942
[OMIYAMA]
Pardon me.

228
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,737
I'm looking for Lucy Morstan,
and I was told that

229
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,071
I could find her here.

230
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,073
[LUCY]
Huh?!

231
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,618
We're very grateful
for your help, young lady.

232
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,286
Oh, it's nothing.

233
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,871
It's thanks to you
that we were able to pay

234
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,998
the contractors on time.

235
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,541
[HUDSON]
That's wonderful to hear.

236
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,793
Though I'm still curious how
a man would go about losing

237
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,253
that much cash.

238
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,630
About that...

239
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,757
I went to pick up
the two million yesterday,

240
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,884
and while I was visiting
our supporters' office,

241
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,220
it so happens that
they offered me a drink.

242
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,348
Honestly, I worried about
sending him for that reason.

243
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,226
Bunmaru doesn't hold his liquor
well, and allowing him to drink

244
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,062
often ends with him
unconscious in the street.

245
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,647
That is the sad truth.

246
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,065
Anyway...

247
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,733
I certainly had
no intention of getting

248
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:17,070
drunk there, but nonetheless,
on my way back to the stable,

249
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,822
I found myself suddenly
getting very sleepy.

250
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,033
[BUNMARU snoring]

251
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,329
[BUNMARU]
Huh...?

252
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,330
It's gone!

253
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,706
[BUNMARU]
And when I finally woke up,

254
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,251
I found the money
had all disappeared.

255
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,128
[BUNMARU]
It's all gone!

256
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,840
Which is the point in
the story where you came in.

257
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,926
[HUDSON] And have you gone
to the police about this?

258
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,135
Oh, no...

259
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,805
I didn't want this to
affect Bunmaru's future.

260
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:47,350
For his sake, we're handling
this matter discretely.

261
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,394
Of course, I'll return
the two million yen

262
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,312
as soon as I'm able.

263
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,649
[OMIYAMA] He's my attendant,
and his failure

264
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,734
is my responsibility.

265
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,947
You haven't changed a bit.

266
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:04,951
Please, sir. There's
no need for you to worry.

267
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,452
I just remembered!

268
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,621
The food you brought for us
that day was wonderful.

269
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,332
I could hardly keep
myself away from it!

270
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,500
[LUCY]
Was it really?

271
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,752
That's a better response
than I usually get.

272
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,672
Yes, I was amazed that you
were able to make it yourself.

273
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,049
It was perfectly chewy, like you
would find at the store‐‐

274
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,593
Bunmaru! This is hardly
the time to gush over food!

275
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,178
I'm so sorry!

276
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,515
I think he just
gave away the game.

277
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,267
Kuma, I need you to go
pick something up.

278
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,561
Sure thing!
Pick up some what?

279
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,981
[OMIYAMA] Right, then.
We'd best be on our way.

280
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:38,359
Sir! I'm gonna be rooting for
you in the next tournament!

281
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,194
Give it everything you've got!

282
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,158
Your excitement is heartwarming.

283
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,577
Now what was it you were telling
me about needing to earn money?

284
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,203
Oh, right!

285
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,497
Whatever job you can
give me, I'll take it.

286
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,751
I want everything you've got,
no matter how small it may be!

287
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:18,066
Yes, who's there?
Ah. Could it be...?

288
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,486
[LUCY]
One million nine‐seventy.

289
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,988
One million nine‐eighty,
one million nine‐ninety...

290
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,365
That's two million.

291
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:29,660
[phone alarm beeping]

292
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,870
Ugh.

293
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:40,046
Hey there. It's been
a while, hasn't it, Doctor?

Boss Kaneko!

295
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,342
Thank you for all your
help on the West Side, sir.

296
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,261
I was able to make
my way to Kabukicho.

297
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,597
And you're adjusting
to the place okay?

298
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,225
Yeah, though
Mister Holmes still hasn't

299
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,060
heard about my case.

300
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,478
I'm not surprised.

301
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,438
His two joys in life are rakugo

302
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,358
and making people
jump through hoops.

303
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,610
I don't envy
the position you're in.

304
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:03,820
Maybe so.

305
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,863
He's definitely been
keeping me busy.

306
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,908
But still... I dunno.

307
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,245
Somehow, I can't bring
myself to hate the guy.

308
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,123
Well, h e's very good
at what he does,

309
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,958
so bear with it, my friend.

310
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,710
Right. Thank you
for everything, sir.

311
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:26,175
While we're here,
how has Little Lu been doing?

312
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,552
[LUCY]

Just come here!

00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,764
Mister Holmes, I know that
you've figured this out.

315
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,599
And you've got more than
enough money to take care

316
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,600
of what she owes!

317
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,519
Get off me!
This isn't your problem!

318
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,354
I'm not going to let this go.

319
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:41,065
You need two million more yen
by the end of the day!

320
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:44,068
So why don't you
go get your money back?

321

[BOTH grunt]

322

[SHERLOCK] Just find the person
who stole the two million off

324
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,034
I'm sure it hasn't
been spent yet.

[WATSON]
You know who the thief is?

00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,082
Obviously. Wanna hear?

Of course! Tell us!

So, old man.

331
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,097
Did you really figure out
who took all that money

332
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,182
from Bunmaru?

333
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,266
Yeah.

334
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,144
But before I explain, you should
try one of those daifuku

335
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,605

00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,570
Sure, it's pretty good.

338
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,780
What's that got to do
with the money?

339
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,073
It is good.

340
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,326
Bunmaru was raving
about it, wasn't he?

Get away from my sister!

00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,184
Come with me.
Keep your mouth shut.

[OMIYAMA] Where do you think
you're going with that child?

[THUG 5B yells]

352
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,696
[OMIYAMA] You were protecting

That's commendable.

Ah! Miss Lucy? Please.

[LUCY grunts]

I've admired you since
the day I came to Kabukicho.

364
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,520
You were the one who told me
I should stay on the high road!

365
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,730
Yeah, thanks,
but I think I'm good.

366
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,525
I always thought daifuku tasted
better without the drugs.

367
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,818
[WATSON]
What do you mean without‐‐?!

368
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,653
[grunts, coughs]

369
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,863
They were a pain
in the ass to get, though.

370
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,117
'Cause that particular drug has
been in high demand recently.

371

All the kids are crazy about
the "delayed onset" thing.

372
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,246
But wait...

373
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,623
Didn't Lucy bring the ones
that Bunmaru ate?

374
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,417
If she made 'em herself,
I think she'd probably

375
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,668
leave the drugs out.

376
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,421
Bunmaru said the daifuku
he had were excellent.

377
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,880
No way Lucy made them.

378
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,341
[BOTH gasp]

379
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,343
If Mary Morstan is willing
to actually pick up

380
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:18,347
a knife to get out of eating it.
Lucy's cooking must be rank.

381
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:19,640
And that means...

382
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,560
The food Lucy brought to the
stable and the food Bunmaru ate

383
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,061
weren't the same.

384
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,271
Okay.

385
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:28,274
But how do you figure it was the
daifuku that put him to sleep?

386
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,109
Bunmaru said he took
it easy on the booze,

387
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,195
and yet he still started getting
sleepy as he was walking home.

388
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,197
And it takes a professional
to make a mochi with

389
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,199
that chewy texture.

390
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,659
So I did some
research and confirmed

391
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,494
with the man himself
that the brand you bought

392
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,038
was what he'd eaten.

393
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,456
Lemme get this straight.

394
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,167
The criminal drugged Bunmaru
with sedative‐laced daifuku,

395
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,211
and then stole the cash
off him once he passed out.

396
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,213
Wait, then did Lucy do it?!

397
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,759
Ugh... You moron.
Were you paying attention?

398
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,677
We just established that
the culprit swapped

399
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,012
Lucy's daifuku for these.

400
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:01,307
That was... literally
that whole conversation.

401
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,935
Well... then who did
the dirty daifuku deed?

402
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,479
[OMIYAMA]
I'm sorry...

403
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,357
[SHERLOCK] The culprit was
none other than Omiyama.

404
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,691
It's true.

405
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,152
I set Bunmaru up
and took the money.

406
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,697
[OMIYAMA] I put the drugged
daifuku out where he was sure

407
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:20,201
to see them, with a note saying
that a fan had brought them.

408
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,161
I knew Bunmaru loved daifuku,

409
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,246
and there was no way
he'd pass them up.

410
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,290
After that, all I had
to do was follow him

411
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,125
until he collected the money.

412
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,752
Then once the
sedatives kicked in,

413
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,797
I stole it off of him.

414
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,634
I needed that money,
to rig my next match!

415
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,678
No... You wouldn't, would you?

416
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,762
Yes.

417
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,139
I barely wrestled in
my last tournament.

418
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,933
And I thought if I was demoted.

419
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:47,895
I would never be able to claw
my way back up from makushta.

420
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,231
Then they offered
to fix my match!

421
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,067
In the end, the big guy
caved to temptation, huh?

422
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,944
The truth is, this kind
of match fixing happens

423
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,404
all the time in sumo.

424
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,073
Gamblers get a payday and
wrestlers stay in the game.

425
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,449
[gasps]

426
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,661
What a boring way
to end a career like his.

427
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,122
So, what does fixing a
sumo match have in common

428
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,083
with eating homemade snacks that
a fan gave you as a present?

429
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,626
Why don't you tell us?

430
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,212
It can leave a bad
taste in your mouth.

431
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,632
[SHERLOCK] That's all
the time we have for today.

432
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,677
[WATSON]
Question.

433
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,637
How do you know Omiyama
still has the money?

434
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,098
Couldn't he have spent
some of it already?

435
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,393
[SHERLOCK]
Hmm! That one's simple enough.

436
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:28,811
[WATSON]
I see.

437
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,646
He lost every match
in the tournament,

438
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,898
which means he didn't buy a win.

439
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,569
I've been eliminated from
the tournament as of today.

440
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,990
After all this, I even managed
to fail in my effort to cheat.

441
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,328
Miss Lucy. Bunmaru.

442
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:52,960

to go and buy my dress?

kicked out of the chorus line.

you just missed her.
She's heading to the club now.

465

[MARY] No! It should
be me working there!

466
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,232
Let me take her place!

I'll pay back whatever
she owes. So please!

suited for the kind of work

469
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,155
I have your sister doing.

470
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,949
And why not?!

471
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,534
Here's a fresh face for you.

472
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,495
Let's give it up
for our new boy, Lou!

473
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,747
‐‐Hey, ladies.

474
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,332
[MASAYA] I won't say
he's not a snack, girls,

475
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,167
but let's not forget
tonight's main course.

476
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:19,129
i.e. me, the legendary
host, Masaya! Huh!

477
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,715
And I wanna thank you all
for coming out to my party‐‐

478
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,510
[DIANA, CHINKILL, MAKI]
Lu‐Lu, we came to see you!

479
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:28,180
[LUCY grunts]
Easy! You're gonna rip the suit!

480
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,558
What's he got that
I don't got? Huh...

481
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,684
[MARY]
Hey, everybody!

482
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:35,062
Make sure you all spend plenty
of money on my boy Lou!

483
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,064
Wait, Mary! The hell?!

484
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,777
Tsk. How boring is that?

485
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,738
This says Bunmaru
moved up to juryo.

486
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,906
Huh.

487
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,533
Sounds like he was
a pretty good wrestler

488
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,202
in his own right.
And since he moved up,

489
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,371
Omiyama dropped
two million yen on an apron

490
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,498
for his ring entrances.

491
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,334
[gasps] That's right.
The case I mentioned before.

492
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,004
It actually started when the
victim ate a mitarashi dango

493
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,798
and‐‐ And I... I guess...

494
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,717
...I'll... tell you later....

495
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,759
[snores]

496
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,846
So it takes three hours
for effect to kick in.

497
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,848
Just as advertised.

498
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,349

[MARY] Aw! Damn, I am cute!
Good eye, Mrs. Hudson!

500
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,230
Mary! Don't tell me
you spent your tuition

501
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,732
on a stupid dress!

502
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,026
[MARY giggles]
Sorry, Lucy.

503
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,490
[SUGIMOTO] Lift your fists into
the sky, cry if ya want.

504
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,784
A tabby try'na live
a tiger life, though.
