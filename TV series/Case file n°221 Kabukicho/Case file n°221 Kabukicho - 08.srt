[WATSON] What are we doing
in a Mahjong parlor?

163
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,572
If the man's in Kabukicho,

164
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,783
and the Missus doesn't know him,
then we'll have to dig deep.

00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,245
[IRENE]
There he is.

166
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,456
‐‐[WATSON] Who's that?
‐‐[IRENE] Tony Shigeru.

167
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,541
They call him the don
of the publishing world.

168
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,918
He knows everything that
happens in print media,

169
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,754
and everybody involved.

170
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,173
[WATSON] Ah, right, Milverton
was a journalist!

171
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,051
[TONY] And what could
have put me on the radar

172
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,011
of the notorious Irene Adler?

173
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,221
I need information
on a Milverton.

174
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,559
I see. What's it worth to you?

175
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,269
How much do you want?

176
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,022
[TONY] If you have
to ask, don't bother.

177
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,067
[IRENE] Hmm. How about a juicy
scoop on the mayor?

178
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,238
Moran lied about his education.

179
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,784
That is juicy indeed.
Your man Milverton is one of

180
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,328
the most accomplished
blackmailers I know of.

181
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,205
A blackmailer?

182
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,749
[TONY] He digs up dirt on
celebrities and politicians,

183
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,751
and they pay him
to bury it again.

184
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,503
All while operating
under the guise

185
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,505
of a legitimate entrepreneur.

186
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,048
Of what kind?

187
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,132
[TONY]
Several.

188
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,842
He runs a variety
of front operations

189
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,220
using multiple
assumed identities.

190
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,180
I'll send a list along later.

191
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,057
[WATSON]
Can you tell us where he lives?

192
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,769
[TONY] Hmm. From what I'm told,
he's set himself up a bed

193
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,105
in the office of one of
his front companies.

194
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,566
That said, I have no idea
which company or where it is.

195
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,152
Then we'll have
to run down the whole list.

196
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,655
[TONY] I'm also informed
he's been paying nightly visits

197
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,241
to a certain old hangout of his.

198
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,660
Lastly, his appearance
has changed dramatically

199
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,328
since his time as a reporter.

200
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,622
In fact the difference was
so stark that I was inspired

201
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,582
to write a poem after I saw it.

202
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,836
[WATSON]
Uh, what do you mean by that?

203
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,255
How badly do
you wanna know, kid?

204
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,048
[WATSON]
Uhh...

205
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,385
How's this?
A scoop on yours truly.

206
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,265
Would Moran use his
measurements as a password?

207
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,851
Of course not.
Why would he even know them?

208
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,477
So what is it?

Yes, that's right.

I've taken a look around,

but I haven't seen anyone
matching his description.

us tells me less than nothing.

In exchange for his silence,

he demanded monthly payments‐‐
