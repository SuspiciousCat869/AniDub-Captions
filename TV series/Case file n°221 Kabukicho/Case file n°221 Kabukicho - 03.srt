00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,560
[WATSON] Six months ago,
I was performing an autopsy

2
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:21,146
on a certain young woman.

3
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,233
I came across something
that looked like a sticker.

4
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,360
I didn't think much
of it at the time,

5
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,320
then recently, I found out that

6
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,781
it was a miniaturized
transmitter.

7
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:35,202
I reported this
information to my boss,

8
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:38,413
and suddenly, it seemed
like my life was in danger.

9
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,581
[WATSON gasps]

[WATSON grunts]

12
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,096
[WATSON] I had to leave
the West Side behind.

13
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,892
[WATSON] The only way
I can return to my old life

14
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:01,562
is to find out
who wanted me dead,

15
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,189
and I need this
man's help to do it.

16
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,232
But...

17
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:08,277
[SHERLOCK]
Hey! Hurry up and make dinner.

18
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,363
Coming right up.

19
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,949
[WATSON]
He has yet to ask about my case,

20
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,826
and I'm not sure he ever will.

21
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,748
[FUYUTO]
This is Shinjuku's West Side.

22
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,711
A tidy grid of well‐lit streets,
teeming with smiling citizens,

23
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,171
walled off from the
morass of crime and chaos

24
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,132
swirling just to the east.

25
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,217
There, on the dark
streets of Kabukicho,

26
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,553
where the trumpeting of
elephants rings in the hour

27
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:38,724
and evil lurks in every
shadow, six detectives roam.

28
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,019
Freaks, geeks, losers,
and loons to a one.

29
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,730
Where they roam,
chaos will surely follow.

30
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,025
And you, babies, are invited
to watch their wild war

31
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,735
of wills and wits.

32
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,377
[GROUP]
Happy Birthday, Moriarty!

So how old are you now, kid?

35
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,090
[MORIARTY]
I'm 16.

36
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,634
You have the smell of a winner,
same as I do, James.

37
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,553
Guys like you don't
belong in this dump.

38
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,388
You should head
to the West Side.

39
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,348
Yeah, this dump
is for guys like you.

40
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,852
[FUYUTO] Hmph. Soon, I'll put
the East Side behind me,

41
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:51,815
Jack the Ripper behind bars, and
300,000,000 yen in my pocket.

42
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,150
No, thanks.

43
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,568
Oh, yeah, that guy.

44
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,278
Been a while since he came up.

45
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,822
That one turned out
to be a fake, right?

46
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:02,367
[MICHEL] The last we saw of the
real Jack was six months ago.

47
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,702
That was when
they found the body

48
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:07,289
of Ward Mayor Moran's
daughter, Alexandra.

49
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,541
Can't say I'm a fan of Moran's,

50
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,418
but that girl was pretty hot.

quite a way with people.

I was up in my office on

It's written like "Outer Space,"
but it's pronounced "Cosmos."

My dad's name
is written like "Earth,"

but it's pronounced "Gaia."

That's quite a tradition.

tell me that he had been

He wanted to write me into his
will as the sole beneficiary.

any children of his own.

00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:52,681
Feels nice, doesn't it?

161
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,226
[GREGORY] Yes, it does!
It feels so, so nice...

162
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,352
There's a good boy.

163
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,187
[GREGORY whimpers]

164
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,065
Now then.
The client today is yours truly.

165
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,818
This is an S‐ranker,
five million with bonus.

166
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,654
I don't think that
Pu guy is really my type.

167
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,114
Pass on this one.

168
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,741
[MICHEL] What's the case look
like on your end, Inspector?

169
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,743
Ninety percent
chance of conviction.

170
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,036
If those are
the odds we're playing,

171
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,997
I'd prefer to sit
out this round.

172
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,332
I trust your judgment.

173
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:24,087
If Beezy's a part of this.
I have no choice but to take it!

174
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,257
[HUDSON] After the sun has
set upon the rest of the world,

175
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,135
our town of Kabukicho
lights up in neon.

176
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,595
If gold and silver
are what you're after,

177
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,057
then get out there and bring
back my precious Pooh bear!

178
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,518
A light gleams
in these men's eyes.

179
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,312
This is a haven for
outcasts and oddballs.

180
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,897
And you're the
reason they call it

181
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,816
"the Detectives' Row House."

182
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,109
Mm... mwah!

183
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,030
The winner will be the one
who can prove Pu's innocence.

184
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,783
Bring that big pot o' honey
straight back to mama.

185
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,077
Give me Pu!

186
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,794
[GUARD 3A]
Hurry it up!

187
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,588
[GUARD 3B]
Come on, shitbags!

188
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,548
‐‐Psht.
‐‐I hear over on the West Side,

189
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,592
they don't treat
people like livestock.

190
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,720
Yeah, 'cause Mayor Moran's a pig
that can walk on two feet.

191
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,804
Hey!

192
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,892
But that's impressive
by pig standards!

193
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,435
A malcontent, huh?

194
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,478
You get a full search.

195
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,313
[KOBAYASHI]
I'm kidding, he's great!

196
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,149
Moran's the best!
Long live Moran!

197
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,195
[WATSON]
This is the place.

198
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,696
[SHERLOCK]
Move on.

199
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,073
Move on where?

200
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,449
There's no way
we can make it through

201
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,867
that hideous gate.

202
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:36,910
Sorry?

203
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,079
It's an inconvenience, but we
don't have a choice if we‐‐

204
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,497
Yes, we do.

205
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,915
[gasps]

206
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,584
[SHERLOCK] We can go back along
the path you took to get here.

207
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,816
[FUYUTO]
The man himself. Right here?

208
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,943
[GREGORY] Yes, Mister B‐zo
was a personal friend

209
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,654
of the late Cosmos Tanaka.
And last night, as it hap‐‐

210
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,405
I'm honored to meet you, sir!

211
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,783
I'm the Row House's
greatest investigator.

212
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,743
Kyogoku Fuyuto's my name!

213
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,787
[B‐ZO] You've got a
grasp of the language,

214
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,831
but if your words are too stiff,

215
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,667
then your heart's gonna
harden up as well, yeah?

216
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,544
Break that shell, baby.

217
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,089
Forgive me. I just...

218
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,466
I'm standing here
in front of my idol!

219
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,343
Oh, I'm your idol, you say?

220
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,386
Yeah!

221
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,889
My childhood friend
gave me a copy

222
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,349
of this book as a gift.

223
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,101
And these pages taught me
everything I know

224
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,769
about being a real man!

225
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,354
Your book is what made me
realize that there's

226
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,857
a whole wide world beyond
the ugliness and chaos

227
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,150
of the East Side.

228
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,277
It's how I learned about
the beauties that await me

229
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,029
if I take life on
at full throttle!

230
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,782
I consider you my
mentor‐‐no, my master!

231
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,743
On your wisdom,
Fuyuto will rise!

232
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,329
It feels so great to hear
you say that, my baby!

233
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,082
I'm always happy to see the
seeds I've planted taking bloom.

234
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,167
[gasps]

235
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,422
[FUYUTO sighs, gasps]

236
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,425
He touched me, he touched me!
He shook my hand!

237
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,302
I'm never gonna wash it again!

238
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,678
[GREGORY] Could you
please give us your account

239
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,972
of what happened
last night, Mr. B‐zo?

240
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,017
Okay. Cozzy and Pu
were sitting out here.

241
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,020
They'd finished working on
the will and started drinking.

242
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,813
I thought about
asking to join them,

243
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,566
but it felt like I would be
interrupting a family thing.

244
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,902
Now, I...

245
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,863
If only I hadn't been
so scared of seeming rude.

246
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,365
[FUYUTO whimpers]

247
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,910
I'll take over from here.

248
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,995
After he finished
writing up the will,

249
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,331
Cosmos had a bit too much
to drink and passed out

250
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,332
on the table.

251
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,000
And while he was unconscious,

252
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,252
Pu pulled a steak knife
out of the roast

253
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,921
and drove it into his back!

254
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,353
[GREGORY] When the fire died,
our investigation revealed

255
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,522
a charred body believed to
be that of Cosmos Tanaka,

256
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,984
and a personal item of Pu's,
which was covered in blood.

257
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,945
But is there some
possibility a third party

258
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,613
did it? Any at all?

259
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,406
[B‐ZO]
Sorry, there's no way.

260
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,201
There wasn't anybody else
on the security tapes.

261
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,036
[GREGORY] There doesn't seem
to be any way around it.

262
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,372
Everything we've seen
points to Pu as our killer.

263
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,498
Killing his client minutes

264
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,583
after they wrote him
into their will.

265
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,211
That seems like a pretty
stupid move for an attorney.

266
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,171
Well, either way,
if we're able to find

267
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,006
the murder weapon
B‐zo described,

268
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,508
then that's the end of it.

269
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,348
Pardon me. You two came
to ask about Pu, right?

270
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,808
[WATSON]
Uh. Yes, ma'am.

271
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,892
Let's see...

272
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,436
What can you tell us about
Cosmos and Pu's relationship?

273
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,438
[HIROKO]
Cosmos was my husband's brother.

274
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,316
The two of them didn't talk
much, but he and Pu were close.

275
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,694
And I can hardly
imagine anything, um,

276
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,570
happening between them?

277
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,658
[SHERLOCK] You had these bills
from several loan sharks.

278
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,035
What did your son and
husband need with this money?

279
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,954
Prostitutes? Gambling?

280
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,914
[HIROKO grunts]

281
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,250
[SHERLOCK]
Then it was gambling.

282
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,876
[HIROKO]
I‐I'm sorry. What does that‐‐

283
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,211
I have to poop.

284
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,671
[HIROKO] The bathroom
is at the end of the hall,

285
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,715
on the right side.

286
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,760
Sorry, my friend
can be a little bit odd.

287
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,971
But rest assured, Mrs. Tanaka.

288
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:28,433
I guarantee you that Pu's case
is in the best of hands now.

289
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,643
‐‐[HIROKO] Our poor little boy.
‐‐[WATSON] Hmm?

290
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,146
[HIROKO] Pu always wanted to be
a doctor when he was young.

291
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,649
But he couldn't stand the sight
of blood, so he went into law.

292
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,111
Killing Cosmos with a knife?

293
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,113
I can't even imagine...

294
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,711
[SHERLOCK]
Hmm...

295
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,058
[FUYUTO humming]

296
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,817
[gasps]

297
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,571
[FUYUTO]
Hmm...

298
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,411
[GREGORY] Really? Definitive
proof of the killer's identity.

299
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,497
Kyogoku. Please fill us in.

300
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,873
Sure, babe.

301
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,958
This one quick call
will explain it all.

302
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,086
[receiver ringing]

303
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,380
[HIROKO] Hello, you've reached
the Tanaka residence.

304
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,547
Hey, girl!

305
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,715
Sorry‐‐ Good afternoon, ma'am.

306
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,884
I'm Kyogoku with
the West Side police.

307
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,761
[HIROKO]
Oh, is this about my Pu?

308
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:47,762
[FUYUTO]
Yes, ma'am.

309
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,473
We wanted to tell you that Pu
has been released from custody.

310
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,601
[HIROKO] He's free?
I'm so happy to hear that!

311
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,645
There's something
I would like to know.

312
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,147
During the time leading up
to Cosmos's death,

313
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,608
had he invited Gaia
and Pu to go gambling?

314
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,568
[HIROKO]
Uh... Well...

315
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,655
[FUYUTO] And that drove
them deep into debt,

316
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,156
or am I mistaken?

317
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,034
[HIROKO] You're not. He twisted
their arms to go with him.

318
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,828
And forced them to keep playing.

319
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,290
[FUYUTO] That's an ugly thing
to do to his family, isn't it?

320
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,959
[HIROKO]
I agree. I hate to admit it,

321
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,420
but a part of me feels that
he got what he deserved.

322
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,672
I'm glad to hear you
say so, Mrs. Tanaka.

323
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,341
Thank you for your cooperation.

324
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,467
There it is.

325
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,302
A clear motive for
Pu and his mother

326
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,054
in the murder of Cosmos Tanaka.

327
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,640
[gasps]

328
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,684
The numbers listed
under these names correspond

329
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,270
to amounts outstanding
on various loans.

330
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,064
And I've called several
lenders to verify this myself.

331
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,232
[gasps]

332
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,985
So, now. I shall
make my declaration.

333
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,737
The culprit in this case
can only be Pu Tanaka.

334
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,322
Ya feel me?

335
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,324
Huh? But I thought
the assignment was to prove

336
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,201
that Pu didn't kill Cosmos.

337
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,619
It was indeed.

338
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,955
And if you want to know why
I would pass up the money,

339
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,916
it's simple. Because justice!

340
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,543
[WATSON]
I see.

341
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,379
[B‐ZO] That's real.
Mad respect for your man here.

342
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,506
[FUYUTO] I know nothing
in life but to be legit.

343
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,300
[GREGORY] Well, Mister Holmes,
if the lack of a motive

344
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,093
was part of your concern,
it seems that we can

345
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,513
safely put that aside.
Pu had more than enough.

346
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,515
From there,
all we have to do is find

347
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:15,808
the murder weapon.

348
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,352
Then, I'm afraid this case
will be as good as solved.

349
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,231
I don't think
this is going to help‐‐

350
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:25,776
Shut up! Pu didn't do it.
There's no way he did it.

351
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,571
Pu's not stupid enough to leave
such an obvious clue!

352
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:29,697
He can't be!

353
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:30,865
Yeah, I agree.

354
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,534
He struck me as
a pretty smart guy, too.

355
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,660
He's a lawyer and, at one point,

356
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,287
he was looking to
become a doctor.

357
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,788
What are you talking about?

358
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,999
That was what
his mother told me.

359
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,459
He went into law because
he couldn't stand

360
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,294
the sight of blood.

361
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,339
She said there's no way he could
take a knife to another person.

362
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,924
[SHERLOCK] The police haven't
said anything publicly

363
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,760
about the murder weapon.
And that means‐‐

364
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,472
[WATSON]
Uh?

365
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,769
[WATSON]
The knife?

366
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,395
[SHERLOCK]
Before Pu came to the row house,

367
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,357
he took this knife home and
handed it off to his mother.

368
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,526
You mean, he's the killer?

369
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,455
[FUYUTO] There's no point
in delaying this further.

370
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:23,960
Now admit your mistake...
and let's be done with it.

371
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,670
[SHERLOCK] And what mistake
would I be admitting?

372
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,964
‐‐[cell phone ringing]
‐‐That's obvious!

373
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,424
After Pu did the deed, he had
to come through this room

374
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,676
on his way out the door.

375
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,761
And he dropped that
murder weapon right there.

376
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,430
‐‐Yeah, baby.
‐‐[gasps]

377
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,848
[B‐ZO] Give me five
and I'll call you back

378
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,434
when all this business
is over with.

379
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,812
[Always good to know you
have a friend, right, buddy?

380
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,359
[Pardon me for asking,
Mr. Holmes.

381
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,987
But I'd really like to know
what's in your pocket there.

382
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,822
'Cause to me,
it looked like a knife.

383
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,866
Maybe even the one used
to kill my friend Cosmos.

384
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,704
‐‐[FUYUTO] It did?
‐‐Your right coat pocket.

385
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,746
[gasps]

386
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,252
[FUYUTO] Then it's time
to close this case... perhaps.

387
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,295
Let's see...

388
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,630
What're you hiding
in your pocket?

389
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,052
[WATSON gulps]

390

[gasps]

[gaspin]

392
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,231
And... what part of this
looks like a knife to you?

393
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,899
That's, ah‐‐

394
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,486
You weren't in the room when
I put my hand in my pocket.

395
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,363
What made you think
I was holding anything?

396
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,367
And why would you
guess that it was a knife?

397
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,745
The same one that killed Cosmos?

398
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,330
[B‐ZO whimpers]

399
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,041
[WATSON]
I'm lost. What's going on here?

400
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,126
You wanna know?

401
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,754
Uh! Oh, boy, do I ever!

402
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,797
So tell me all about it!

403
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,550
[giggles]

404
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:55,760
Hey, old man.

405
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,720
Quit grasping at
straws already, would ya?

406
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,139
Any idiot could tell ya
that Pu got Cosmos drunk

407
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:01,265
and stuck a knife in him.

408
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,225
The whole story
points straight to that!

409
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,977
Ugh. But the problem is...

410
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,771
...if any idiot could tell you,
then it's too obvious

411
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,855
to be true.

412
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:08,981
Well, if Pu hadn't done it,

413
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,359
then who done did it,
huh, smart guy?

414
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,277
A few things
caught my attention,

415
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,279
like the love letters from
Cosmos that Pu's mother

416
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,366
was keeping stashed inside
a drawer back in her bedroom.

417
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,284
So he was carrying
a torch for her?

418
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,328
But in the end, she fell
for his little brother.

419
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,746
Pu's old man, Gaia.

420
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,289
Such is life, right?

421
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,874
Well, not that
that wasn't a sad story

422
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,377
and everything, but how 'bout
you get back to the point

423
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,462
and tell us who killed
Cosmos already?

424
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,422
So he had the hots
for his sister‐in‐law,

425
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,174
who cares?
It's not like his brother's

426
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,759
the dead one here, right?

427
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,260
That might be
the official story,

428
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,262
but I'm not sure I buy it.

429
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,682
Huh?! They found
his burned‐up body.

430
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,309
They certainly did find
somebody's burned‐up body.

431
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,311
There you go
splitting hairs again!

432
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,063
Cosmos and Pu were
the only ones in the room,

433
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,232
and Pu's still
got his body, so...

434
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,817
...that crispy critter
couldn't have been

435
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,527
anybody but Cosmos!

436
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,445
I suspect that the charred
corpse they found

437
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,073
was actually Pu's father, Gaia.

438
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,241
[B‐ZO whimpers]

439
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,493
Cosmos had been
allowing Gaia to stay at Gachoen

440
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,745
in secret, under the
pretext of hiding him

441
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,372
from the loan sharks.

442
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,040
He called Pu up
to the hotel and got him

443
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,710
passed‐out drunk, dressed up
Gaia's corpse to look like

444
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,212
it was his own, stuck the
knife in Pu's hands,

445
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,755
and then lit the fire.

446
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,465
Pu woke up in
the middle of a fire with

447
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,260
a bloody knife in his
hands and ran away.

448
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,303
And that's the whole story.

449
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:25,474
Hmm... All right, so where
the hell'd Cosmos get to?

450
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,934
B‐zo was right‐‐
I did put the knife

451
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:30,354
in my pocket earlier.
But he never saw that.

452
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,357
Only somebody in the room with
me could have known about it.

453
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,608
[WATSON]
Hmm...

454
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,610
[SHERLOCK]
Hmph! You got a point there.

455
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:40,197
Wha‐‐?! But how did B‐zo
figure it out, then?

456
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,491
Obviously, he heard
it from Cosmos.

457
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,201
They were on the phone.

458

[FUYUTO]
Shut up!

was the killer,

00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,957
then I say bring him here!
Show me the money!

461
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,167

You want to see him right now?

00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,127
Yes! Right here, right now!

463
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,629
[SHERLOCK] I would be
more than happy to oblige.

[COSMOS gasps, screams]

owed him quite a bit of money

00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,440
That's the reason you agreed to
take part in this hideous farce.

469
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,941
[B‐ZO sighs]

470
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:21,197
Party's over. Time to clear out.

471
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:25,659
Oh, my god...!

472
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,536
[SHERLOCK] How's peeping
on a stranger's hotel room

473
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:30,080
like getting caught dead
to rights for murder?

474
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,457
Why don't you tell me.

475
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,459
In the end,
somebody's gonna get boned.

476
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,503
Been saving that?

477
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,546
[SHERLOCK] That's all the
time we have for today.

478
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,637
[HUDSON] Pu Bear. We need to
have a talk about our future.

479
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:45,638
Excuse me?

480
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,014
I'll get right to the point.

481
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,974
We can't just ignore
this age gap.

482
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,601
What age gap?

483
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,483
[FUYUTO groans]
Farewell... B‐zo...

484
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,653
[SHERLOCK]
Why aren't you cleaning yet?!

485
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,571
[WATSON]
Uh?

486
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,699
There's a schedule,
start following it already!

487
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,535
Your share of the
apartment is from that end

488
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,454
of the sofa to this end,
so don't dangle your feet.

489
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,580
Understood.

490
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,582
Can we please talk
about my case?

491
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:14,708
After I told my boss,

492
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,418
I noticed someone watching
me from behind‐‐

493
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,295
[SHERLOCK]
Never mind, get out!
