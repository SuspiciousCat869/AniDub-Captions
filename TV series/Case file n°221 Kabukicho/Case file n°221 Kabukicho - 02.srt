00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,722
[HUDSON]
This is Shinjuku's West Side.

2
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,474
A tidy grid of
well‐lit streets,

3
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,518
teeming with smiling citizens,

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,269
walled off from
the morass of crime and

5
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:22,272
chaos swirling just to the east.

6
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:24,441
There, on the dark
streets of Kabukicho,

7
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,527
where the trumpeting of
elephants rings in the hour

8
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:30,739
and evil lurks in every
shadow, six detectives roam.

9
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:34,451
Freaks, geeks,
losers and loons to a one.

10
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,745
Where they roam,
chaos will surely follow.

11
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,747
And you, darlings,
are invited to watch

12
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,625
their wild war
of wills and wits.

13
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,046
[WATSON] I'm still
not sure how this works.

14
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,548
Do all the detectives
at the Row House

15
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,133
take on one case
at the same time?

16
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,761
I suppose you would
want to know about all that.

17
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,805
Okay.

18
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,139
When a client brings us a case,

19
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,392
it falls into
one of three ranks.

20
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,519
The lowest is an A‐rank.

21
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,729
For A‐rank jobs,
a client hires one

22
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,400
of the detectives directly.
Basically normal P.I. work.

23
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,610
S‐rank is a step up,
with a minimum reward

24
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,112
of one million yen.

25
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,822
These jobs are open
to all in the row house,

26
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,533
but expenses aren't covered, and
only the one who solves the case

27
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,577
gets to bring home that bacon.

28
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,830
And lastly,
there's the S‐rank with bonus.

29
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,207
Where the client covers all
detective's expenses during

30
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,002
the investigation whether
they solve the case or not.

31
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:28,338
Naturally, everyone wants
a piece of that action.

32
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,673
Ya follow me, babe?

33
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,136
[HUDSON]
Eyes over here, honey.

34

Ah! Sorry.

35
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,141
So if I had an A‐rank case and
I wanted to hire Mister Holmes,

36
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,350
how much is that?

37
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:44,062
Hard to say. He doesn't
care much about money.

38
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,065
He only takes cases
he finds interesting.

39

you all of this because

I want to help you get better!

42
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,707
How could you not
want ten days' worth

43
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,583
of vegetable fiber
in a single meal?

44
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,710
I don't need more fiber.

45

[WOMAN 2A]

I was wondering how you did it.

55

Ah?

56
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,442
A woman in her 30s
would be jealous of your skin.

You want me to cook?

in a car accident.

The culprit remains at large.

After being caught on camera
during the gold heist

two weeks ago,
the phantom thief Cobra

has evaded law enforcement.

Pardon me for interrupting.

But could we begin by discussing
the pay rank for your case?

Hah. A low S.

[KOBAYASHI growls]

That's the bare

to get everybody to show up.

And we'll have to cover
our own expenses, too,

all that great of a job.

[KITA] You're so in! Those
moles of yours are perfect!

129

Moles under the eyes
aren't an uncommon feature.

130
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,975
But color, size, location.

131
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,770
It takes an exquisite balance
of all these factors to create

But you've already passed, so
you'll be performing that day.

Until at long last, the day
came for my big debut.

But then...

I tried calling Star Promotions
just a little while ago.

157

They told me
that there's nobody

Well, anyone have questions?

165
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,893
Have you talked to your
parents about becoming an idol?

166
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,396
They might have some
advice that could help.

167
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,857
I wish I'd had the chance.

168
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,735
Miss Fujiko lost her
parents at an early age.

169
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,821
She's been keeping that flower
shop going all by herself!

170
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,032
That part‐timer
Saori is working there.

171
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,700
What's some
retired cabaret girl know

172
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,660
about doing actual work?

173
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,830
[FUJIKO] That's not fair,
Saori's a total sweetheart.

174
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,374
Are you staying at a hotel?

175
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,543
I am. I was
planning on checking in

176
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,795
after the audition
this afternoon.

177
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,006
It's too late for them
to refund my reservation,

178
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,133
so Saori told me to just
stay there and leave

179
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,426
the shop to her.

180
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,303
Not a whole lot
to this one, is there?

181
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,388
I wouldn't be too
sure about that.

182

There's more going on
than you might think.

How did you catch us?

00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,709
You want to know?

00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,002
I do.

You're sure?

I'm sure. So let's hear it.

[SHERLOCK chuckles]

I tell ya, the kids these days
are into some weird crap!

00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,069
Oh boy, what is it now?

343
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,571
What, you haven't heard?

344
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,282
Fujiko from the flower shop
got picked up as an idol!

345
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,491
Who'd a' thought?

346
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,201
Eh, that whole
thing was horse shit.

347
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,203
Well, that's a
little harsh, isn't it?

348
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,122
I mean, she's not
much to look at, sure,

349
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,707
but she's a sweet girl!

350
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,292
Not her, ya dummy.

351
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,252
I'm saying the
audition was a con.

352
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,213
But what's the point of
planning a whole fake audition?

353
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,382
That's a fair question.

354
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,010
Y'see, there's this
girl named Saori.

355
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,846
Ah, you mean the part‐timer
from the flower shop?

356
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,431
Yeah, but the
problem is she doesn't

357
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,349
know anything about flowers.

358
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:21,684
I went there to
pick up a cyclamen

359
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,102
and she said they'd sold out.

360
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,938
So? Shops sell out
of stuff sometimes.

361
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,607
But they couldn't have
sold out of cyclamen

362
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,734
at this time of year.
It's a winter flower.

363
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,777
Ooh! There's a shock for ya!

364
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,154
And what's more,
she came out front with

365
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,157
little bits of concrete dust
all over her clothes.

366
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,242
All those song and dance
lessons were just a trick

367
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,828
to get Fujiko out of
the shop every day.

368
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,164
So that Saori could smash
a hole through the back wall

369
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,083
into the alley, and guess
what's behind the place?

370
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,003
[gasps]
The Bentendou pawn shop!

371
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,464
No doubt there's plenty
there worth stealing,

372
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,715
but busting a hole
through the wall seems

373
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,759
a little much, don'tcha think?

374
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,052
Here's the twist:

375
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,637
That Kita guy
who ran the auditions

376
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:01,182
also goes by another name.
Kitaro the Mongoose.

377
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,892
Ooh! Oh! I know that name!

378
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,185
That's right.

379
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,396
The Mongoose was once the rival
of the bank robber called Cobra.

380
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,398
And he knew that Bentendou
was where Cobra used

381
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,901
to clean up the filthy
lucre from his heists.

382
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,570
You're saying the idol
gimmick was just a trick

383
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,615
Saori and Kita came up with to
lure poor plain‐jane Fujiko

384
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:21,202
out of her shop so they could
bust into Cobra's secret stash?

385
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,871
Precisely. So what's
a desperate idol have

386
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,707
in common with a guy
caught robbing a pawn shop?

387
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,293
Why don'tcha tell me?

388
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,129
In the end, both of
'em are gonna get screwed.
