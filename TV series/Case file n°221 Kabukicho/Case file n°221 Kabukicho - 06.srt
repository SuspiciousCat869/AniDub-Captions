[KOBAYASHI]
Don't touch me, it hurts!

473
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:22,364
Now. Let's give
that guy his money back.

474
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,741
And since it's
a special occasion,

475
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,075
whatever you want's on me!

476
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,410
[KIDS cheer]

477
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,288
[overlapping yelling]

478
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,625
Captain. This was all my fault.

479
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,003
You did mess up,

480
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,922
and your friends
nearly paid the price.

481
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,801
But in the end, you had the
courage to stand up for them.

482
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,471
And that is the leadership
that this town needs.

483
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:46,639
Ah.

484
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,476
‐‐Hey, Yoshio!
‐‐Captain!

485
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,102
Come on, guys!

486
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,064
[YOSHIO sniffs]
Yeah!

487
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,106
[MORIARTY gasps]

488
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,068
Hey, Captain. What's wrong?

489
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,111
[YOSHIO]
Hmm? Captain?

490
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,948
Aw, crap!

491
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,616
I was supposed to be going
to a concert tonight with

492
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,244
a friend of mine
from school, guys!

493
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,662
Oh, come on!

494
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,539
No worries. See ya, Moriarty!

495
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,540
‐‐Let's go.
‐‐[MORIARTY] Later.

496

[overlapping talking]

497
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,679
[gasps]
Hey, what are you doing?

498
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,055
[SHERLOCK guffawing]

499
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,348
[MORIARTY]
Huh...?

500
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,894
[MORIARTY chuckles]

501
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,312
You're a goof.

502
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,989
[GODFREY]
Today is the future!

503
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,866
[CROWD]
Future!
