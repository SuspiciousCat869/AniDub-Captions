it's a way bigger deal
than some dick pics.

Other way 'round, I'd say.

39
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,052
Mayor Moran already had
the information,

which was Jack's
reason for going after

[MORIARTY groans]

00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,244
No, there's no way.

168
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,537
[MORIARTY]
So where'd you end up stowing

169

‐‐that USB drive anyway, huh?

Jack already
ransacked this place,

171
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,460
so it's definitely not
safe to keep it here.

172
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,629
I'm worried.

173
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,964
Hey, here's an idea.

174
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,257
Why don't I hang onto it?

175

‐‐[WATSON] Don't give it to him!
‐‐Ah!

176
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,262
[MORIARTY]
Where did that come from?

177
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,889
Just... Uh...

178
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,849
Wouldn't that put you
in harm's way?

179
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,018
If Jack found out,
he'd come after you.

180
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,394
[MORIARTY] Yeah, I guess,
but you don't need to

181
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,604
freak out about it.

Oh, yeah. Of course.

[WATSON screams]

[MORIARTY]
What's with you today?

188
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:51,002
It's terribly rude to scream
in a man's face, Doctor.

189
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,300
You've got company!

190
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,597
[MORIARTY] He knows where you
are, so you may as well talk.

191
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,806
Later!

192
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,769
[gasps]

193
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,813
At last, we meet again,
dearest brother of mine.

[SHERLOCK whimpering]

195
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,945
[MYCROFT] Detective Lestrade
told me all about it.

196
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,321
From what he said,

197
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:22,492
Irene Adler's body is being
held by the East Side police.

198
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,577
And her autopsy
is scheduled to be conducted

199
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:27,747
at Shinjuku Medical University
on the West Side.

200
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,124
This is under direct
orders from the mayor.

201
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,544
Is that all you
came here to tell me?

202
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,129
Unless my memory fails me,

203
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,091
you and Irene were very
close at one point, right?

204
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,009
I thought you might take
exception to a stranger

205
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,678
opening up her body.

206
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,141
At the end of the day,
we're still family.

207
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,811
If something might leave
my dear brother in distress.

208
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,146
I'd like to help.

209
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,856
In exchange for the drive.

210
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,775
Straight to the point as always,

211
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,193
though I'll have to
insist that you give me

212
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,861
the real one this time.

213
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,741
As for the mayor,
he's under the impression

214
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,160
that we're still trying
to recover the data.

215
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,912
[SHERLOCK] Then you're
double‐crossing Moran?

216
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,498
Heh. I find that
suggestion insulting.

217
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,876
I'm a faithful servant of
the ward mayor's office.

218
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,671
In any case,
you're not getting the drive.

219
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,589
But, once I've cracked it,

220
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,550
I will share the
contents with you.

221
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,845
We have a deal.

222
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,346
With that, dear brother,

223
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,390
I can only ask that you try
and access that data

224
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,101
as quickly as possible.

225
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,352
One thing.

226
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,688
Tell Mayor Moran that Irene
was already cremated

227
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,524
with her possessions.
All of them.

228
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,277
[MYCROFT]
Understood.

229
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,618
Hey. Was it okay
to make that deal?

230
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,329
I had no other choice.

231
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,540
I can't have anyone else
messing with her body.

232
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,959
I understand.

233
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,003
Hey, remind me.

234
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,921
Isn't Shinjuku Medical
University where

235
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,090
you worked
before you came here?

236
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,217
Tell me about your case again.

237
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,386
Okay. Let me think.

238
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,181
[WATSON]
Six months ago,

239
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,225
I was performing an autopsy on
a certain young woman.

240
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,562
A murder victim, by the
name of Alexandra Moran.

241
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,272
[SHERLOCK]
The ward mayor's daughter.

242
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:17,440
[WATSON]
Right.

243
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,275
I found a foreign object
stuck in her hair,

244
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,694
something that looked
like a small sticker.

245
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,907
[WATSON] Only recently,
I learned from Boss Kaneko

246
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,033
that the thing was actually

247
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,744
a miniaturized
radio transmitter.

248
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:33,498
I'd reported it to
my boss when I found it.

249
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,041
And shortly after that,

250
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,335
strange things started
to happen to me.

251
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,421
Things that could
have killed me.

252
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,006
That's when I went
to Boss Kaneko,

253
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,009
who planned my escape across
the wall to the East Side.

254
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,973
He told me that
if I could find you,

255
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,935
you'd be able to figure out
who it was that wanted me dead,

256
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:54,977
and I could continue...

257
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,604
[SHERLOCK]
It's a little odd, isn't it?

258
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,148
Ionno. I guess that
depends what "it" is.

259
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,817
Moran ordered Irene's
body to be sent

260
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,820
to Shinjuku
Medical University...

261
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,988
Though, I might be getting
used to being out here.

‐‐Uh? Oops.

to shut the fridge.

00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,994
[SHERLOCK] ...and subsequently
faced repeated attempts

265
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,456
on his life. You tell me,
what are the odds of that?

266
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,458
A half‐eaten can of peaches?

Remember the day Jack
broke into Sherlock's apartment?

You said Yoshio had
gotten in an accident

and left the group to go help.

But that was all a lie.

You were really trying to get us
away from the apartment

so you could look for

00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,690
You're saying Moriarty is Jack?

323
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,359
Where'd you pull
that out of, John?

324
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,903
Nah, that's a
pretty goofy theory, Doctor.

325
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:51,988
Yeah, right?

326
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:52,989
Guys, I swear!

327
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,532
Irene told me herself!

328
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,533
[GROUP]
Huh?

329
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,743
[WATSON gasps]

330
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,161
Oh, hon.

331
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,748
All this stress you're underd
must be getting to your head.

332
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,292
[WATSON]
Look! I can smell her perfume

333
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,626
when she shows up‐‐

334
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,587
Maybe you should go take a nap.

335
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,589
Please... Listen!

336
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,717
[FUYUTO] I say the man called
John speaks the truth!

337
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,884
[gasps]

338
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,136
[WATSON]
Mr. Kyogoku!

339
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,930
[MORIARTY] Why you gotta
be like that, Go‐go?

340
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:21,559
Right. If Kyogoku
says that, so do I...

341
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,060
Ahh...

342
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,937
[FUYUTO]
Thank you so much, Maki.

343
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,439
I'm glad you believe in me.

344
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,481
[MAKI]
Always and forever.

345
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,649
[MARY]
Gag.

346
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,942
[FUYUTO]
My love!

347
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,903
Hey, it's okay, Doc,
don't let this get you down.

348
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,739
You tried and
that's what counts.

349
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,198
Later!

350
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,995
[MAKI, FUYUTO
murmuring, giggling]

351
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,564
[gasps]

352
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,066
[MORIARTY gasps]

353
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,906
[SHERLOCK]
What are you doing?

354
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,199
[WATSON gasps]

355
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,663
[SHERLOCK] There is zero
chance that he's Jack.

356
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,748
[WATSON] I couldn't believe
it either at first,

357
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,958
but on the day that Irene
was attacked, he was already

358
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,795
with her in the theater
somehow before I got there!

359
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,298
He knew where Irene was
hiding because I told him‐‐

360
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,133
because he's someone I trust.

361
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,386
Uh? What?

362
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:42,556
[SHERLOCK] So, why does Jack
seem to show up where you do?

363
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,849
Apart from Moriarty and me,

364
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,936
the only person who knew
where Irene was hiding is you.

365
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,813
You're... You're kidding me!

366
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,357
Stay out of my sight
from now on.

367
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,278
[WATSON sighs]

368
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,449
[FUYUTO]
He turned it around on you?

369
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,619
[WATSON] Yeah, and now
I don't know what to do.

370
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,373
It seems obvious enough.

371
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:10,084
You just have to find out
what's on that drive.

372
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:13,170
If you're right about Moriarty,
then that'll prove it.

373
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,090
Yeah. But I don't think
I have a way to do that.

374
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,883
Well, I most assuredly do.

375
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,052
If you can get the drive to me,
I would have no trouble

376
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,596
finding someone to open it up.

377
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,723
But...

378
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,891
[FUYUTO]
Are you afraid of something?

379
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,686
[WATSON]
Afraid isn't the word I'd use.

380
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,229
What will you do next?

381
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,940
Another friend could
die if you don't act.

382
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,984
Are you willing to accept that?

383
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,193
[gasps]

384
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,576
[FUYUTO]
Like I said before,

385
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,745
your only choice now is
to pick up the pieces

386
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,539
and keep on fighting
for the fallen.

387
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,499
So that maybe,
someday, in the future,

388
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,460
the war will finally be won.

389
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,756
[WATSON]
Okay. I'll do it.

390
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,468
[SHERLOCK snoring]

391
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,261
[sighs]

392
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,397
Good.

393
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,531
It's not here.

394
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:23,991
Wait, that's right!

395
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,043
Found you.

396
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,253
[SHERLOCK snoring]

397
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,760
It's done.

398
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,386
[FUYUTO]
You have the drive?

399
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,180
[WATSON]
Yeah, right here.

400
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:49,642
First, are you really going
to be able to crack it?

401
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,643
Of course I am.

402
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,978
Now stop wasting my
time and hand it over.

403
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,271
‐‐Quickly!
‐‐[WATSON groans]

404
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,523
[FUYUTO]
What are you waiting for?!

405
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,649
Give it to me!

406
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,734
Uh! Ah! Wait a minute!

407
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:01,070
Mr. Kyogoku, you're scaring me!

408
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,988
Then hand it over and get lost!

409
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,574
[WATSON grunts]

[gasps]

411
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,161
[FUYUTO]
Did that get your attention?

412
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,163
Now give me the drive
so that I can catch Jack

413
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,706
and make my name!

414
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,209
[WATSON gasps]
Does that mean... it was you?

415
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,461
[FUYUTO groans]

416
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,172
Ah!

417
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,259
[FUYUTO gasps]

418
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,929
[SHERLOCK]
Good job, Watson.

419
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,430
You did something right.

420
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:32,935
[MORIARTY chuckles]

421
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,522
[SHERLOCK]
Hmph.

422
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,156
[SHERLOCK]
Now, let's get going.

423
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,659
The stage is set and
the audience is waiting.
