from the cops for months,

James Moran,
the son of ward mayor

Jack, who has been
living in Kabukicho under

was assumed in the deaths

Before he left for
the East Side, I mean.

22
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,068
Yes.

23
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,487
I met him when I was
working as Alex's tutor.

Whoa! [British accent]

00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,370
[IRENE]
She was sickly and frail,

27
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,164
so much that she could
rarely leave her room.

28
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,166
And then, the day
she finally managed

29
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:27,004
to get out of the house,
she was murdered by Jack.

30
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,257
I couldn't believe
it was a coincidence.

31
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,884
It seemed like
Mayor Moran might be hiding

32
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,597
some connection
to Jack the Ripper.

33
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,933
And that's why you decided
to steal the USB drive.

34
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,643
[IRENE]
Exactly.

35
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,562
You were right to be suspicious.

36
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,522
Moran had been hiring
Jack to take out anyone

37
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,107
who stood in his way.

38
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,943
The data on his USB drive
was proof of that.

39
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,445
But Jack destroyed the drive,

40
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,031
meaning we have no concrete
evidence tying Moran to any of

41
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,574
the crimes he committed.

42
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:01,538
I guess Alex was just a casualty
of whatever they were up to.

00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,248
Yeah. It seems that way.

His own father tried
to have him killed.

What could drive someone

Moriarty had no reason
to kill Jack like that.
