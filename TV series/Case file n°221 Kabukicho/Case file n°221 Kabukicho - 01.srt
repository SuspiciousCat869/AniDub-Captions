164
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,411
[FUYUTO] The current stage
of rigor mortis would indicate

165
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,039
no less than six
hours since death.

166
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:44,417
Kyogoku Fuyuto's
eyes cannot be fooled.

167
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,753
This poor girl
died far too young.

168
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,214
Great Buddha preserve us.

169
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,217
[FUYUTO] Inspector, could we
see the victim's cell phone?

170
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,510
[GREGORY]
Bring it in.

171
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,310
[GREGORY]
Ahh, Mr. Holmes, please proceed.

172
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,146
[MICHEL] Well, you certainly did
take your time getting here.

173
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,192
[MICHEL]
Who are you?

174
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,819
I'm his driver. Hello.

175
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,153
[MICHEL]
Hmm.

176
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,450
It looks like the uterine
body and cervix

177
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,410
have been fully extracted,

178
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,996
but the job wasn't
done very cleanly.

179
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,017
[sniffs]

180
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,103
Say, do you smell what I smell?

181
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,146
Yeah.

182
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,397
I'd say Bahamas.

183
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,315
You'd say Ba‐huh?

184
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,109
So, who is he talking to?

185
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,487
Can't tell. Probably
either Hatsu or Kuma.

186
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,947
[SHERLOCK sighs]
Where is her phone?

187
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,283
I just handed it to Kyogoku.

188
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,037
Oh. Apologies.

189
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,166
All yours.

190
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,126
This condo is
currently unoccupied,

191
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,129
and it's hard to imagine the
girl came here all by herself.

192
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,755
She didn't have any
messages instructing her

193
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,008
to come, either, so it seems
likely that Jack brought

194
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,676
her up personally.

195
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,890
Hold on! What are
you trying to pull?!

196
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,434
[FEMALE VOICE] Hello, gentlemen!
Welcome to the White Rose.

197
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,644
To make a reservation,
please leave a message with

198
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,438
the desired date and time‐‐

199
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,315
[GREGORY] Ah! You have
to quit doing things

200
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,275
like that, Sherlock!

201
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:37,614
It appears that the victim
took off her clothes willingly.

202
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,574
It stands to reason that
they knew each other

203
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,075
and agreed to meet up here.

204
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,827
Yeah, I'm with you.

205
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,163
[FUYUTO] Hah! These eyes
of mine can already see

206
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,166
how this case is going to end!

207
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,209
Gentlemen.

208
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:59,510
Well, then. Friends,
we have a lead to follow up on.

209
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,264
Where are we?

210
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,891
Don't get out much, I take it.

211
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,477
We're at the White Rose.

212
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,939
The biggest cabaret
club in all of Kabukicho.

213
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,402
The owner's a former
host named Masaya.

214
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,613
Word around town is the
man personally interviews

215
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,406
all the girls here and
then sleeps with

216
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,242
the ones he likes the best.

217
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,036
And it only gets
worse from there.

218
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,665
[WOMEN] It's lovely
to meet you boys! Hi!

219
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,959
All right, we'll put
everything on this.

220
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,752
Okay, you got it!

221
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,629
Heh!

222
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,631
[MICHEL] Hm? When
we're on a case with

223
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:40,051
a special bonus like this,
the client covers all expenses.

224
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,095
Dining and
entertainment included.

225
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,972
It's a nice little perk.

226
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:51,437
[WOMAN 1B] Hmm? Hey now,
I can make that for you.

[SHERLOCK gulps]

228
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,899
How about some drinks for us?

[belches]

230
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,611
Do you know Sayuri Onoue?

231
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:02,448
Uh. No. We don't know
each other's real names.

232
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,825
Bring someone who does.

233
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,453
Come on. Nobody likes
talking about work, right?

00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,914
Mm? Uh. Sorry.

235
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,499
Cosmetic blepharoplasty on

236
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,877
the upper eyelids, hyaluronic
acid fillers under the eyes,

237
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,881
and a bit of a nose job.
My compliments to the surgeon.

238
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,342
I smell traces of
benzalkonium chloride

239
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,304
and chlorhexidine gluconate
mixed with your body's odor.

00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,180
Hmph. You've been
turning tricks to pay off

00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,391
the loan for your surgery.

I'm done with this.

You had to chase her off.

Is just a moment of fun
really too much to ask?

At this moment, yes.

No. Now kindly get out.

from this place three days ago.

you were in contact with

00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,426
Even if you always kinda look
like someone ran over your dog!

324
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,928
That's a hell of a way
to greet someone

325
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:34,929
in his own home.

326
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,639
Sit down and get comfortable!

327
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,307
So, what's your take?

328
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,434
Well, I couldn't help but
notice that the guy had missed

329
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,145
a button on his clothes,
which means...

330
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,690
[gasps]
...it was the lover who done it!

331
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,693
No. The girl's lover
had no part in all this.

332
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,444
Huh? How ya figure?

333
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,238
I've got a pretty good
profile of the killer

334
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,408
figured out, and that guy in
the pictures on her phone

335
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,326
isn't anywhere close, see?

336
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:00,288
Wha‐‐? A profile?
If it straight up says

337
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,455
‐‐he's a murderer...
‐‐What's this?

338
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,708
It's his mystery‐solving
rakugo deal.

339
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,544
I can't say it's great theatre.

340
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,212
Forensic rakugo?

341
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,880
[SHERLOCK] Hmph. Well,
one thing we do know

342
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,923
is she went into a room

343
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:14,468
with a total stranger and got
naked right out the gate.

344
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,887
I'd like to meet
a girl like that!

345
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,432
I'm sure you could,
but bring your wallet,

346
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,642
because she won't be
doing it just for fun.

347
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,520
Professionals generally want
to be paid for their work.

348
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,731
[gasps]
Wait, that hostess...

349
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,067
You think the killer works
at the White Rose?

350
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,362
Yeah. Matter of fact,
I'm quite sure of it.

351
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,783
So then, what were you saying
about the killer's profile?

352
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,161
[sighs]
Let's see...

353
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,413
Over a hundred and
eighty centimeters tall.

354
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,498
Might look like
a high roller at a glance,

355
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,542
but actually living
on a pauper's wages.

356
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,211
Likes to unwind with
an occasional cigar.

357
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,796
And the nail on
the right index finger

358
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,592
is a bit longer than the rest.
That about does it.

359
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:55,885
What makes you
think that they're

360
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,012
over 180 centimeters?

361
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,139
If you look at the spacing
between the footsteps

362
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,433
left on the floor,
it's not hard to tell.

363
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,434
Fair enough.

364
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,354
But where did you get that they
don't make a lot of money?

365
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,398
They had a cigar,
but it wasn't a good one.

366
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,776
Smoked it all the way
down to a stub.

367
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,111
Dumped the ashes
right on the floor.

368
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,905
Nothing but affectation.

369
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,990
A peasant's pretension
to the high life.

370
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:18,991
And you said
that the killer's

371
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,661
right index
fingernail was long?

372
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,205
Remember those
wings drawn in blood?

373
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,289
On the bits they
would have painted

374
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,749
using their
right index finger,

375
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,919
you could make out a bunch
of scratch marks.

376
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,546
Which means
this one wasn't Jack.

377
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,715
Wait, how can you tell?

378
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,092
'Cause at the
other crime scenes,

379
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,803
Jack always had plenty
of paint to work with.

380
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,138
This time the killer didn't set
about drawing the wings

381
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,766
until the victim's blood
had stopped pumping,

382
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,185
so the palette was a bit dry.

383
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:49,021
As a result, they had
to spread the blood thin.

384
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,482
Thin enough that that fingernail
scraped right through it.

385
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,608
[doorbell rings]

386
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,446
It seems they've arrived.

387
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:58,739
When you say "they"...

388
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,032
[SHERLOCK]
Yes, I mean our culprit.

389
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,033
[gasps]

390
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,202
[doorbell ringing]

391
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:10,626
[doorbell ringing quickly]

392
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,131
I'm here!

393
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,470
Well, that guy
didn't fit the profile‐‐

394
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:22,555
[grunts]

395
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,556
You kiddin' me?!

396
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,183
You call me out here just to
slam the door in my face?!

397
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,685
Huh?!

398
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:31,021
Dunno if he killed anyone,
but that jacket's criminal.

399
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,650
This would be Masaya.
Owner of the White Rose.

400
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,736
While he was off in the
back room boffing the girls

401
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,821
who made it past
the job interview‐‐

402
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,573
His personal assistant
would come along

403
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,616
after him looking for scraps.

404
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,828
Uh... That's not. I don't‐‐

405
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,037
Ugh...

406
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,539
You should follow him.

407
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,959
I bet it'll be fun!
See ya later!

408
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,961
Well, why'd you
even call me here?!

409
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,129
Huh?!

410
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,801
[sniffs]

411
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:01,802
Smell that?

412
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,387
I know that smell!

413
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,723
Yep. Bahamas was right.

414
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,518
[SHERLOCK] Hey, you.
Could I get a light here?

415
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,564
[gasps]

416
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,650
Much obliged, friend.

417
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,535
Hey, old man.

418
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,204
You're tellin' me this
is our guy, right?

419
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,705
[gasps]

420
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,625
[SHERLOCK]
Of course, ya goof.

421
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,918
It's obvious, isn't it?

422
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,253
[ASSISTANT whimpers]
Beg pardon?

423
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,509
[SHERLOCK] When Masaya
rejected a candidate,

424
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,886
this guy would pick her up
and have his way with her.

425
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,849
[SHERLOCK] This time, he called
the victim to that condo,

426
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,893
under the pretext of
a second interview.

427
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,896
[SHERLOCK] He tried
to force himself on her

428
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,732
once she undressed,
but she resisted.

429
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,442
[ASSISTANT]
Calm down. Stop!

430
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,152
[SHERLOCK]
And died for it.

433
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,455
[SHERLOCK] Our man thought
that he could pin her death

434
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,082
on Jack the Ripper.

435

[WATSON gasps]

438
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,766
That's rough.
I guess in the end,

439
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,351
none of it worked out for him.

440
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,647
[WATSON]
Huh?! Come on!

441
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,484
So then, we found
the real killer,

442
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,486
and he turned out
to be a fake Jack.

00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:43,737
Do I have that right?

There's a lesson in all this.

How are a fake serial
killer and a fish alike?

Why don'tcha tell us?!
