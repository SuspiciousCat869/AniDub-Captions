I cannot answer that.

has the authority

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.827 position:50% align:center
to access this information.

Are you researching something?

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:48.882 position:50% align:center
When I was trapped
at the embassy,

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.301 position:50% align:center
how did you know
I was in danger?

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.845 position:50% align:center
Something was jamming
your radio frequencies.

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:56.723 position:50% align:center
As a result, I couldn't
verify your location.

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:58.433 position:50% align:center
And so, I was worried.

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:00.143 position:50% align:center
Did HEUSC contact you?

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.104 position:50% align:center
'Fraid not. I think the
frequency that connects HEUSC

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:06.149 position:50% align:center
to this server was also
affected at the time.

we could. Don't worry.

I agree. You couldn't have
done anything else back there.

Come in.

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:35.215 position:50% align:center
[JUDGE 6A]
So you caused immense chaos

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:37.092 position:50% align:center
during the
investigation process.

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:39.427 position:50% align:center
Then you allowed
the suspect to die.

00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:42.055 position:50% align:center
As such, we might never know
the truth behind the attack.

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:43.473 position:50% align:center
[JUDGE 6B]
First of all,

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.975 position:50% align:center
we must clarify who was
responsible for these failures.

[JUDGE 6C]
Anything to say?

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.862 position:50% align:center
Inspector Kato told
us to go on a break,

00:03:57.946 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
so that's what we did.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:00.615 position:50% align:center
I second that.

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.702 position:50% align:center
I didn't wanna chase after
the perp. He made me!

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:06.871 position:50% align:center
I had no choice but to join the
pursuit. I was following orders.

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:08.915 position:50% align:center
Sure, I did tell you
to follow me, but...

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:10.959 position:50% align:center
[JUDGE 6A]
Inspector Kato, please refrain

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:12.502 position:50% align:center
from speaking over the others.

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:15.630 position:50% align:center
[KATO sighs]
Okay, yes.

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50% align:center
Technically the
attacker did die.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:20.468 position:50% align:center
But don't forget we managed
to save the president's life.

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:22.345 position:50% align:center
Except, from what I understand,

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.848 position:50% align:center
Officer Saeki deserves
the credit for that win.

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:27.392 position:50% align:center
She's the one who spoke
to the janitor, yes?

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:29.144 position:50% align:center

Mm-hm!

Will you please explain
what happened to them?

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
I can't. I was off-duty

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:37.652 position:50% align:center
and I wasn't involved
with the failed mission.

My bet's on Mizuo Future Tech.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:30.830 position:50% align:center

were involved in

the manufacturing of the
jamming device are pretty high.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:37.337 position:50% align:center
Of course, that means they're
likely behind the gas as well.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:53.760 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:55.470 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:06.272 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:08.608 position:50% align:center
Kazuko Imura, right?
You're under arrest

00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:11.236 position:50% align:center
for reckless driving and
vehicular manslaughter.

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:13.405 position:50% align:center
[IMURA gasps]
No, you can't.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.490 position:50% align:center
I-I didn't do this.

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:18.201 position:50% align:center
Something took over.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.870 position:50% align:center
Call an ambulance! Please hurry!

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:23.081 position:50% align:center
There's no need.
This man's dead.

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:24.332 position:50% align:center
Get out of the car.

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:26.584 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.521 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:49.649 position:50% align:center
--[KAMEI] How's it going?
--[MAHORO] Good morning.

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:52.068 position:50% align:center
I see we're missing
our resident rich kid.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:53.653 position:50% align:center
Cho playing hooky, too?

00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:57.407 position:50% align:center
Nah. They're here, just
in the interrogation room.

00:10:58.616 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:00.994 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
What's up?

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:05.040 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO] He dragged her
down here for reckless driving.

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:06.458 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
You're kidding me.

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:07.834 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO] Apparently,
she ran from some traffic cops

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.962 position:50% align:center
going over a hundred
kilometers per hour.

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:13.673 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.
That's some coincidence.

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:17.093 position:50% align:center
She's a high-level employee
at Mizuo Future Technologies.

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:18.928 position:50% align:center
They've deep ties
with the Kambe Group.

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:20.513 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Is that so?

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:22.307 position:50% align:center
Then, shouldn't we
join the interrogation?

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.392 position:50% align:center
The Superintendent
General ordered us

00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:27.020 position:50% align:center
to leave questioning to him.

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:28.980 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
The Superintendent General?

00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:31.358 position:50% align:center
What in the world is going on?

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:35.779 position:50% align:center
Let's talk about the gas
cartridge from the embassy.

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:38.907 position:50% align:center
Your company was involved
in its production, correct?

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.784 position:50% align:center
What's the meaning of this?

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:42.827 position:50% align:center
I was brought here
for reckless driving.

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:44.371 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] Which department
builds the cartridge

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:46.581 position:50% align:center
and who is in charge of it?

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:47.665 position:50% align:center
No clue.

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:49.626 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Is she telling the truth?

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
[HEUSC]
I cannot answer that.

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:53.213 position:50% align:center
I want to talk to my lawyer.

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:56.174 position:50% align:center
What alloy is used in the
manufacturing of the cartridge?

00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:58.385 position:50% align:center
I don't know that.
My role in the company is--

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:00.345 position:50% align:center
You used Poliador Kambe Limited

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:02.055 position:50% align:center
to illegally
import it, didn't you?

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:04.974 position:50% align:center
Call my lawyer! Right now!

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:08.269 position:50% align:center
Have you met Shigemaru Kambe?

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:11.439 position:50% align:center
[IMURA grunts]
Sorry. I don't know them.

00:12:11.523 --> 00:12:14.275 position:50% align:center
Who's that? What's
he been asking about?

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:16.319 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.

00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50% align:center
Open this woman's
computer, HEUSC.

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.033 position:50% align:center
[HEUSC]
It's locked with a password.

00:12:22.117 --> 00:12:25.036 position:50% align:center
Unlock it and show
the screen on the wall.

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.372 position:50% align:center
[IMURA]
What's this?

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:29.791 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Open all files onto the desktop.

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center
[HEUSC]
Opening files.

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:34.295 position:50% align:center
[IMURA]
No... How are you doing this?

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:42.303 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Increase speed a thousand times.

00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:45.223 position:50% align:center
[HEUSC]
Task complete.

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:46.933 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] Keep only the
files you couldn't open

00:12:47.017 --> 00:12:49.227 position:50% align:center
on the desktop.

00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:54.482 position:50% align:center
[IMURA gasps]
This is against the law!

00:12:54.566 --> 00:12:55.525 position:50% align:center
Stop it!

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.318 position:50% align:center
Open the file named ADM.

00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:58.403 position:50% align:center
My lawyer!

00:12:58.486 --> 00:12:59.779 position:50% align:center
[HEUSC]
There is a password stopping me.

00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:01.698 position:50% align:center
Unlock it.

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:06.036 position:50% align:center
[HEUSC] You do not
have that authorization.

00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:10.665 position:50% align:center
Looks like he ran
into a brick wall.

00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:12.375 position:50% align:center
So what now?

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:15.837 position:50% align:center
Hey, how are you?

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.715 position:50% align:center
--I need a favor.
--[KATO] Um.

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:21.134 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO] There's someone
I want you to look into for me.

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:24.346 position:50% align:center
[door opens, closes]

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:27.265 position:50% align:center
[KATO growls]

00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:31.102 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
Kato.

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:32.729 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:34.981 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:36.733 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
Excuse me.

00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI]
Hello, Haru.

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:44.032 position:50% align:center
Sorry for taking
some of your time.

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:45.700 position:50% align:center
Have a seat.

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:50.372 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI] You're good friends
with Kambe, aren't you?

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:52.040 position:50% align:center
We work together. What's up?

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:54.751 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI] This Imura woman
he's interrogating now.

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.128 position:50% align:center
He brought her in on suspicion
of reckless driving,

00:13:57.212 --> 00:14:00.423 position:50% align:center
but it seems a bit strange.

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:02.884 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] It's possible she
wasn't in control of the car.

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:05.512 position:50% align:center
Someone else may have
been driving it remotely.

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:08.014 position:50% align:center
You think it was... Kambe?

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:10.058 position:50% align:center
He has clout, as you know.

00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:11.893 position:50% align:center
He's well-connected
with the higher-ups,

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:14.604 position:50% align:center
including the
Superintendent General.

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:17.857 position:50% align:center
That ties my hands in some ways.

00:14:17.941 --> 00:14:20.485 position:50% align:center
You want me to look
into this, don't you?

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:22.112 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI chuckles]

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:31.454 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
How's your nephew doing?

00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:33.873 position:50% align:center
Quite well. He has
a good job thanks to you.

00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:35.500 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
I'm happy to hear it.

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:38.128 position:50% align:center
I really appreciate
all you've done.

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:42.340 position:50% align:center
Here's everything
that I could track down.

00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:44.259 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
What's it look like?

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:45.468 position:50% align:center
[INFORMANT 6A]
There were some strung-out brats

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:46.928 position:50% align:center
who ended up getting arrested

00:14:47.012 --> 00:14:48.471 position:50% align:center
when they went
a little too wild.

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:51.433 position:50% align:center
Their parents work in big
corporations and legislation,

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:53.852 position:50% align:center
so criminal charges
were dropped.

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:01.609 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Hey, Kambe!

00:15:01.693 --> 00:15:03.361 position:50% align:center
Why did you bring Imura in?

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:04.946 position:50% align:center
Reckless driving.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.614 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
What are you really after?

00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:08.992 position:50% align:center
If you'll just
tell me, I can help.

00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:12.162 position:50% align:center
I don't always like
how you do things,

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.706 position:50% align:center
but I do have to admit
that you can catch criminals.

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:16.541 position:50% align:center
So I have faith in your motives.

00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:18.543 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] Remember what
they said at the inquiry?

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:20.795 position:50% align:center
Don't stick your nose
where it doesn't belong.

00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:21.880 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:15:21.963 --> 00:15:23.256 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Depending on your actions,

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.717 position:50% align:center
they might have you
turn in your badge.

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.724 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMIZU] The lawyer
will be here in two hours.

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:35.060 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO] Can't you get
me five minutes in there?

00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:37.812 position:50% align:center
Don't ask me for
the impossible, Cho.

00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:41.107 position:50% align:center
Remember, you've got a hefty
pension dropping in your lap--

00:15:41.191 --> 00:15:42.317 position:50% align:center
soon!

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.069 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
That's not what this is about!

00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:46.154 position:50% align:center
Have you already
forgotten that case?

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:49.157 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMIZU] Come on, you've
done everything you can.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:53.411 position:50% align:center
You know... I'm never
going to give up.

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:56.581 position:50% align:center
--[door opens]
--[KATO] Hey.

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:00.293 position:50% align:center
Bad timing?

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:04.506 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMIZU] Well, I'm off. Cho,
please don't overdo it, okay?

00:16:10.512 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
Good talk? Sounded fun.

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:15.725 position:50% align:center
If it were up to him, I'd stay
away from potential danger

00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:17.686 position:50% align:center
and retire safe and sound.

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:20.814 position:50% align:center
He's patronizing an old man.

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:22.357 position:50% align:center
Sounds right.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.819 position:50% align:center
And I can't figure out what
Kambe is thinking. He's a vault.

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:28.321 position:50% align:center
From what I can tell, it doesn't
seem like he's simply trying to

00:16:28.405 --> 00:16:31.199 position:50% align:center
expose Mizuo Future's
evil deeds.

00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:33.368 position:50% align:center
Something that shouldn't
have been brought into Japan

00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:37.497 position:50% align:center
was smuggled in...
and Imura here knows something.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.582 position:50% align:center
It's our job to expose that.

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center
Am I wrong?

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:45.046 position:50% align:center
[KATO] That would be justice.
But we can't even interrogate.

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:49.300 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:52.095 position:50% align:center
So sorry to have taken this
much of your time, ma'am.

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:53.471 position:50% align:center
[IMURA] Give me a break!

00:16:53.555 --> 00:16:55.265 position:50% align:center
My lawyer will have
something to say about this--

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:58.018 position:50% align:center
The man actually
just arrived here.

00:16:58.101 --> 00:16:59.019 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:01.021 position:50% align:center
Ah, it's about time. So?

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:04.315 position:50% align:center
You've got the all clear to
go home whenever you like.

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:11.281 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Follow Kato.

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:13.241 position:50% align:center
[HEUSC]
Understood.

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:18.121 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE]
You called for me?

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:21.041 position:50% align:center
Do you recognize this woman?

00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:24.002 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE] I don't believe so.
HEUSC may have a profile.

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:25.587 position:50% align:center
Ask yourself.

00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:28.256 position:50% align:center
Hey, HEUSC,

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.842 position:50% align:center
tell me about the woman
shown on the screen right now.

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:32.052 position:50% align:center
[HEUSC]
I cannot do that.

00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:34.929 position:50% align:center
You do not have
that authorization.

00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:37.057 position:50% align:center
Could it be? Is it
the same for you?

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.475 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:41.936 position:50% align:center
I've been denied before,
but it's definitely a rarity.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.271 position:50% align:center
I wasn't shocked.

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:45.523 position:50% align:center
I just assumed I didn't
have top-level clearance.

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:47.734 position:50% align:center
What were you asking
about each time?

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:50.445 position:50% align:center
Were there any patterns
to what you couldn't access?

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:54.783 position:50% align:center
No. Still, though,
there weren't many times.

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:59.371 position:50% align:center
Huh? The lawyer
isn't here after all?

00:17:59.454 --> 00:18:01.081 position:50% align:center
Can you go and ask
what's going on?

00:18:01.164 --> 00:18:02.916 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Of course.

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:09.005 position:50% align:center
Please, relax.

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:13.385 position:50% align:center
[IMURA sighs]

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:17.514 position:50% align:center
Now then, let's talk about
those sea grape things

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:19.224 position:50% align:center
that were used in
the jamming device.

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:21.810 position:50% align:center
[IMURA gasps]
This again?!

00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:24.979 position:50% align:center
You're illegally importing them
from Poliador, aren't you?

00:18:25.063 --> 00:18:26.648 position:50% align:center
The cat's out of the bag.

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:30.193 position:50% align:center
I've had enough of this!
I will not be bullied!

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:32.904 position:50% align:center
How is Akitoshi?

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:37.033 position:50% align:center
Looks like he's hanging out
with a bad crowd if you ask me.

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:40.036 position:50% align:center
I'd hate for that to
become common knowledge.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.498 position:50% align:center
It'd probably be bad for both of
you.

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:45.583 position:50% align:center
You call yourself a cop!

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:47.002 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:47.085 --> 00:18:49.838 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO] I've solved
cases like this for 35 years.

00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:52.340 position:50% align:center
Now, I wanna know
about the ties between

00:18:52.424 --> 00:18:55.844 position:50% align:center
Mizuo Future Technologies
and the Kambe family.

00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
Sounds like your punk
son is off the hook,

00:18:58.221 --> 00:18:59.848 position:50% align:center
but if it gets out
he was arrested,

00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:03.018 position:50% align:center
I'm sure your company won't
be able to ignore it.

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
[IMURA sighs]
All right, you win.

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.411 position:50% align:center
I'll explain.

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:26.041 position:50% align:center
But first, I beg you,
let me put a call in to my boss,

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:28.168 position:50% align:center
then I'm all yours.

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:40.472 position:50% align:center
She's about to crack.

00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:42.849 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but this is wrong.

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:45.226 position:50% align:center
Listen. When you're a detective,

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:48.355 position:50% align:center
sometimes you have to
play dirty to get results.

00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:51.483 position:50% align:center
I can't accept that.

00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:53.068 position:50% align:center
What did you say?

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:02.077 position:50% align:center
Kato!

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.745 position:50% align:center
[KATO grunts]

00:20:17.092 --> 00:20:18.259 position:50% align:center
Damn it.

00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:21.429 position:50% align:center
Don't think you're
gonna get away with this.

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:23.431 position:50% align:center
Would you prefer that I drive?

00:20:23.515 --> 00:20:24.808 position:50% align:center
No, thanks. I'll be fine.

00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:26.184 position:50% align:center
[car chimes]

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:31.439 position:50% align:center
Something's not
right. Get out, now!

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:40.115 position:50% align:center
[gasps, groans]

00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:04.723 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
So...

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:10.186 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO] I think it's
time for us to talk.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.148 position:50% align:center
You did it, didn't you?

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.403 position:50% align:center
Director! What is
the meaning of this?!

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:22.741 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Why is Cho going that far?
