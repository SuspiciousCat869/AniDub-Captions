[DAISUKE grunts]

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:42.625 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO] I assumed the
reason you came to our division

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:46.755 position:50% align:center
was to protect the Kambe
family from being investigated.

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:49.466 position:50% align:center
And that everything covered up
following the embassy debacle

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.384 position:50% align:center
was your doing.

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:56.681 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO] I never imagined
we'd be after the same thing.

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:59.559 position:50% align:center
And there you have it. Both
of you want the truth behind

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:02.437 position:50% align:center
Sayuri's death 19 years ago.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.023 position:50% align:center
It's my belief that the
substance called adollium

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:07.776 position:50% align:center
is in some way a key
component to this case.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:10.403 position:50% align:center
But I have no idea what it is.

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:13.365 position:50% align:center
And him? What now?

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:15.617 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO] I doubt he can
answer all of our questions,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.328 position:50% align:center
but he should have more
information we can use.

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:22.624 position:50% align:center
We'll do the interrogation here.
I can't trust the police.

00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:58.887 position:50% align:center
[BUTLER 8A]
This is the sole meunière.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.348 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO sighs]
I prefer sashimi

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:04.059 position:50% align:center
or a fish simmered in soy sauce.

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:06.311 position:50% align:center
Got chopsticks?

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:08.271 position:50% align:center
I'll bring them right away.

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:09.564 position:50% align:center
Where's Kato?

00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:13.068 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
Hm? I sent him out on an errand.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.072 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Quite the collection.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:19.574 position:50% align:center
How many boxes are there?

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:22.494 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:28.667 position:50% align:center
You're working with
Cho, aren't you?

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.168 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Yeah.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:36.675 position:50% align:center
If only he'd let this
go and retire in peace.

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
More case files?

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.474 position:50% align:center
Cho is thorough.

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:47.602 position:50% align:center
He's been occupying
my locker for 19 years.

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:50.438 position:50% align:center
I can finally get
rid of this nuisance.

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.275 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMIZU] Remind him
that he's not young anymore

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.361 position:50% align:center
and should take it easy.

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:01.574 position:50% align:center
I will.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.831 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
I'm coming in.

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:14.754 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
How about a drink?

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:18.216 position:50% align:center
They don't have saké here,
but it's damn good booze.

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:24.806 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
Enjoy.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.310 position:50% align:center
It's been 19 years
since we did this--

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:31.604 position:50% align:center
drinks, just the two of us.

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:41.239 position:50% align:center
Still holding on to those?

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:46.161 position:50% align:center
When did we turn
into such old men?

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.339 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMARU]
I won't do anything bad.

00:04:57.422 --> 00:05:00.967 position:50% align:center
[SAYURI] And you honestly
expect me to believe you?

00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:04.179 position:50% align:center
I'm putting everything
on the line for this research.

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:06.598 position:50% align:center
I won't let anyone interfere.

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:10.268 position:50% align:center
Then there's nothing
more for us to talk about.

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:12.896 position:50% align:center
Hey! Wait! Sayuri!

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:19.194 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
This is the institution

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:23.907 position:50% align:center
your father was a part of,
the Third Laboratory.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.702 position:50% align:center
It's my presumption that this is
where he first met your mother.

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:29.079 position:50% align:center
But look.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:32.332 position:50% align:center
It's not listed in the
current organization chart.

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:34.542 position:50% align:center
I tried to investigate
the lab after the murder,

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.961 position:50% align:center
but I never figured out
where it was located,

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.547 position:50% align:center
let alone what they
were researching there.

00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:44.260 position:50% align:center
Right, then. I'll leave
this part to you.

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.137 position:50% align:center
[KATO grunts]

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:48.139 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay.
We'll split the work.

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:50.975 position:50% align:center
If you need anything, please
talk to my butler, Hattori.

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.103 position:50% align:center
[KATO gasps]
Hold on a second!

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:54.020 position:50% align:center
What?

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:56.147 position:50% align:center
I have to do this on my own?

00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:58.483 position:50% align:center
Do you have more
pressing matters?

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:00.068 position:50% align:center

How am I supposed to crack
this lab after so many years?

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.915 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Hm?

[DAISUKE]
What was Shigemaru Kambe's role

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:22.132 position:50% align:center
at the Third Laboratory?

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
[HEUSC]
I cannot answer that.

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:26.511 position:50% align:center
Where was said
laboratory located?

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:28.388 position:50% align:center
[HEUSC]
I cannot answer that.

00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:30.181 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Who was Sayuri Kambe's employer

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:32.058 position:50% align:center
after she graduated
from college?

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:33.643 position:50% align:center
[HEUSC]
I cannot answer that.

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.061 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE grunts]

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:37.689 position:50% align:center

seems to be confidential.

But at least we
have a pattern now.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:41.943 position:50% align:center

I want you to research them.

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.320 position:50% align:center
I don't care how
trivial the findings are.

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.531 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE]
Of course, as you wish.

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:49.409 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
Let's see.

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:50.618 position:50% align:center
You answered to Saiki,

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:52.996 position:50% align:center
the Criminal Affairs
director at the time.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.373 position:50% align:center
He wanted constant case updates.

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:58.918 position:50% align:center
You also gave him the key
I found to the train locker.

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:00.170 position:50% align:center
Correct?

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:03.465 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
What was Saiki's objective?

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:05.592 position:50% align:center
Who was he answering to?

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:08.511 position:50% align:center
I'm telling you,
there's no way I would know.

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:11.264 position:50% align:center
If I did, I would
have ended up like...

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:12.807 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
Six months after

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:15.727 position:50% align:center
the investigation of Sayuri
Kambe's murder was called off,

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.563 position:50% align:center
Saiki died in
a freak car accident.

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:21.816 position:50% align:center
They killed him
to silence him, yes?

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.653 position:50% align:center
What was in that locker?
Don't play dumb with me.

You're wrong.

No. Your mother and

Their marriage was on the rocks.

00:08:58.621 --> 00:08:59.873 position:50% align:center
Mother left the house.

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:03.001 position:50% align:center
And Father, in a fit
of rage, murdered her.

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:06.129 position:50% align:center
Later, his guilt
was too unbearable,

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:09.507 position:50% align:center
and so, he killed himself.

The past is the past.

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:14.220 position:50% align:center
What about the Third Laboratory?

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:17.849 position:50% align:center
Father and Mother were arguing
over something called adollium.

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:19.184 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:21.770 position:50% align:center
You must know something.

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:25.440 position:50% align:center

get involved further.

Wait!

Please bear with me for now.

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:02.310 position:50% align:center
It's HEUSC.
From what I can tell,

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:05.397 position:50% align:center
it's been erasing
pertinent information.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
I believe HEUSC is listening
to our conversations.

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:12.070 position:50% align:center
Even if we whisper, it's capable
of reading our lip movements.

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:47.499 position:50% align:center
from this nametag is
going to be retrievable.

[KATO grunts]
Damn it.

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:52.379 position:50% align:center
I thought I was so close, too.

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:55.131 position:50% align:center
Bring up the
building in the back.

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:57.175 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:00.053 position:50% align:center
I've seen this.

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.725 position:50% align:center
[HATTORI]
Apologies for making you wait.

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:08.728 position:50% align:center
This is crack-open <i>naengmyeon</i> .

00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:11.439 position:50% align:center
I'm beginning to think
you don't serve normal food.

00:12:11.523 --> 00:12:13.358 position:50% align:center
So fancy.

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:18.029 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
What's wrong?

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:19.572 position:50% align:center
Oh, nothing.

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:21.366 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO grunts]

00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:24.494 position:50% align:center
Ah. Mind getting him
some chopsticks, too?

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.788 position:50% align:center
Anything for our guests.

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:29.541 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO] You say you
figured out the location

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:30.875 position:50% align:center
of the Third Laboratory?

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:34.212 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Yeah. Take a look at this.

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:36.589 position:50% align:center
They're wearing
lab coats and badges.

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:39.968 position:50% align:center
It's safe to infer that this
is where the lab is located.

00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:41.136 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you noticed there's

00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:44.139 position:50% align:center
a western-style mansion
in the background.

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:46.307 position:50% align:center
We found it.

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:47.475 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
Hm?

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:50.520 position:50% align:center
It's a Kambe family
villa on a mountain.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:53.898 position:50% align:center
We traveled there several times
to escape the summer heat.

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:55.650 position:50% align:center
It's currently being
used as a test site

00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:59.237 position:50% align:center
by an affiliate company
building robots and drones.

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:12.542 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
There a problem?

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:13.793 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
He kept pestering me,

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
insisting that we
bring you here in person.

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:18.131 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI whimpers]
I beg you,

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:21.343 position:50% align:center
you gotta get me out of here.

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:23.636 position:50% align:center
Why's that?

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.888 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
We were talking,

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.599 position:50% align:center
and then suddenly
he started getting scared.

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:29.225 position:50% align:center
If I may...

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.187 position:50% align:center
We'll heighten security.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.646 position:50% align:center
Quite the opposite.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:34.981 position:50% align:center
Let's keep it light.

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:37.484 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI gasps]
Dammit.

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:39.486 position:50% align:center
You don't understand anything!

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:42.655 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You've got
a great point there.

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:44.991 position:50% align:center
Which is why I want you to talk.

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:48.036 position:50% align:center
[door beeps]

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:49.788 position:50% align:center
I don't think it
will be necessary

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:53.833 position:50% align:center
to use this exit,
but just in case.

00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:56.169 position:50% align:center
Mr. Cho, your hand, please.

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:58.463 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO chuckles]
Just Cho is fine.

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:05.512 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE] This is for
emergency evacuation.

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:08.056 position:50% align:center
The tunnel leads
to the lake outside.

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:14.562 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE] You'll clear the
forest road in two kilometers.

00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:15.897 position:50% align:center
Once you're out,

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.067 position:50% align:center
turn left at the service
road in a hundred meters.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.235 position:50% align:center
The destination will be

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:23.196 position:50% align:center
approximately 500
meters from there.

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:26.616 position:50% align:center
[KATO] Don't know if you noticed
but the gates way over there.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.827 position:50% align:center
I thought you said you
guys owned the place.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.412 position:50% align:center
Put this on.

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:33.456 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why don't we waltz
through the front door?

00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:36.793 position:50% align:center
[KATO gasps]
Are you kidding me?!

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:38.128 position:50% align:center
What's going on?!

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:40.130 position:50% align:center
If this isn't your house,
then we need a warrant.

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:41.881 position:50% align:center
There's no need.

00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:44.551 position:50% align:center
The Third Laboratory is
in the mansion's basement.

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:46.720 position:50% align:center
I'll infiltrate it while
you create a diversion

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:47.929 position:50% align:center
and draw out security.

00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:49.556 position:50% align:center

Wha--? Come again?

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:51.766 position:50% align:center

Mr. Kato, I wish you
the best of luck.

00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:46.071 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE] Don't worry.
I made sure not to kill them.

00:15:47.489 --> 00:15:49.282 position:50% align:center
They've got drones?!

00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:57.374 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE]
These are anti-air spheres.

00:15:57.457 --> 00:16:00.251 position:50% align:center
Even if machine guns were
to fire at you from every angle,

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:01.628 position:50% align:center
you'd be completely protected.

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:02.837 position:50% align:center
I guarantee it.

00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:05.048 position:50% align:center
[KATO coughs]
Wait.

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:06.549 position:50% align:center
Hold on just a second.

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:08.551 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE] Now is not the
time to catch your breath.

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:11.513 position:50% align:center
Mr. Daisuke has
reached the mansion.

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:12.722 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE]
Master Daisuke,

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:15.058 position:50% align:center
there's an intruder
in the Kambe residence.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.187 position:50% align:center
It seems like they're heading
toward the basement cell.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.856 position:50% align:center
[KATO] What do you mean?
Who'd break in there?

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.566 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] I've been
waiting for this to happen.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.778 position:50% align:center
Suzue, proceed according
to our previous arrangements.

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:28.279 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:16:28.363 --> 00:16:31.157 position:50% align:center
[KATO] Hey! Can someone explain
what the hell's going on?!

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:33.451 position:50% align:center
[beeping]

00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:36.121 position:50% align:center
It would seem our
mystery man took the bait.

00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:40.208 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI gasps]
Hold on, you used us as a decoy?

00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:44.713 position:50% align:center
This bomb...

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:48.299 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE]
Master Daisuke.

00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:49.467 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:50.802 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE]
I closed the firewalls

00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:54.097 position:50% align:center
after the intruder arrived
at Area B as we planned.

00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:57.392 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE] However, they're
breaking through them.

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:58.810 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
With what?

00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:00.020 position:50% align:center
The intruder is somehow

00:17:00.103 --> 00:17:02.939 position:50% align:center
utilizing voice and
iris recognition, but

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:04.441 position:50% align:center
that doesn't make sense.

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:08.069 position:50% align:center
Only superusers in the Kambe
family have that authority.

00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:11.531 position:50% align:center
[gasps] This can't be.

[SUZUE]
Master Daisuke,

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:19.873 position:50% align:center
the intruder is gaining access
using your father's credentials!

00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:21.166 position:50% align:center
With the clearances given to me,

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:23.501 position:50% align:center
I cannot stop them
from going futher!

00:17:23.585 --> 00:17:26.838 position:50% align:center
[KATO] It must be someone
who's after Cho and Takei.

00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:28.048 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE]
Likely.

00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:29.507 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Don't you have any ideas?

00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:31.634 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE] Master Daisuke
has the highest authority,

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:33.428 position:50% align:center
so if he returned...

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:35.430 position:50% align:center
No, he wouldn't
make it back in time!

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:38.516 position:50% align:center
There's a helicopter parked
near me. Would that work?

00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:41.978 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE]
It's flyable.

00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:46.274 position:50% align:center
However, it'd still
take roughly 20 minutes.

00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:49.361 position:50% align:center
Kambe, head to the airfield!

00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:51.654 position:50% align:center

00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:52.864 position:50% align:center
No good.

00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:13.968 position:50% align:center
But you must hurry, Cho.

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:20.308 position:50% align:center
It can't be.

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:21.518 position:50% align:center

What happened?

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:23.228 position:50% align:center
The system has been shut down.

00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:23.121 position:50% align:center
Come in!

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:25.623 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Damn!

00:19:28.543 --> 00:19:30.503 position:50% align:center
Guess this will have to do.

00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:33.590 position:50% align:center
Wish it'd been
a cup of saké though.

00:19:45.602 --> 00:19:48.480 position:50% align:center
And finally,
he makes an appearance.

00:19:51.858 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:56.613 position:50% align:center
It's you. And I didn't
think you were still alive.

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:58.114 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI]
Come on!

00:19:58.198 --> 00:19:59.908 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
Even if I fled,

00:19:59.991 --> 00:20:02.827 position:50% align:center
there's nowhere
left for me to run.

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.384 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
Hm.

00:20:34.192 --> 00:20:35.819 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE gasps]

00:20:41.616 --> 00:20:44.869 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry that I failed you.

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:47.872 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
So, explain... What happened?

00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:50.375 position:50% align:center
If you'd only come back, maybe.

00:20:51.376 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE] There was an escape
route in the basement room.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.425 position:50% align:center
However, Cho and Mr. Takei
chose to stand their ground.

00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:03.346 position:50% align:center
You said you had full control
of this stupid mansion, right?!

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
You damn liar!

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:10.645 position:50% align:center
Just know, both Cho and
Takei's blood is on your head!

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:16.693 position:50% align:center
I said to take it easy.

00:21:23.992 --> 00:21:28.038 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMIZU sniffs]
Cho... you fool.

00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:31.958 position:50% align:center
You were tenacious
till the very end.
