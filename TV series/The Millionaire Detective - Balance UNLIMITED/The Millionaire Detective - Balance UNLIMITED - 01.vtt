00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:35.869 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
I had a father and a mother.

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:38.496 position:50% align:center
I believe I had
a happy childhood.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:45.045 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
However, after one fateful day,

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:47.505 position:50% align:center
everything changed.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.928 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Huh?

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:58.099 position:50% align:center
What's up? Big case, Hoshino?

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:00.810 position:50% align:center
Nah. Not really.

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.605 position:50% align:center
[KATO grunts]

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:08.193 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] After that day,
the world felt hollow.

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:11.029 position:50% align:center
I was bored by every
facet of my life.

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:13.281 position:50% align:center
Nothing excited me.

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:16.576 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Morning.

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:20.372 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN moaning]

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:23.249 position:50% align:center
[KAMEI gasps]
That's weird.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:27.170 position:50% align:center
Man, these pop up ads
sure are insane, am I right?

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.631 position:50% align:center
The guys in the First
Division were sure in a hurry.

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:31.132 position:50% align:center
Have you heard anything?

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:33.009 position:50% align:center
'Bout them? Not really.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:38.181 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:44.145 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Hello, Modern Crimes Force.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.739 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] 
In Japan...

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:57.158 position:50% align:center
...I found purpose.

00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:02.580 position:50% align:center
Right. We'll take care of it.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:06.001 position:50% align:center
[KATO] Chief, the
Security Department says

00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:07.210 position:50% align:center
they're short on manpower.

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:08.586 position:50% align:center
They want a couple
of us to head to

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.672 position:50% align:center
the Classic Car
Festival in Ginza.

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:14.509 position:50% align:center
Okay. I trust you'll
take care of it.

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:17.470 position:50% align:center
[KATO sighs]
I'm happy to go myself.

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:20.306 position:50% align:center
But I could use some backup.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.227 position:50% align:center
I'm not surprised they're
poaching from our staff.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.188 position:50% align:center
Like we've got
nothing better to do!

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:31.401 position:50% align:center
Kamei.

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:33.069 position:50% align:center
Can't, I just found a
website I need to look into.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:38.825 position:50% align:center
I was told that Motoyama from
Security is working the scene.

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:42.620 position:50% align:center
Sacchan's there?
You can count on me, Kato!

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:44.247 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.219 position:50% align:center
[KATO] Well, we'll
be back by 1700 hours.

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:13.818 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
My name is...

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:18.448 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
...Daisuke Kambe.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:59.215 position:50% align:center
There's a fancy bar around here.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.551 position:50% align:center
Apparently the First
Investigation Division dudes

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:03.345 position:50% align:center
hang out there.

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.973 position:50% align:center
You should know since you used
to be in the First Division--

00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:08.641 position:50% align:center
[KAMEI groans]

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:10.352 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:15.690 position:50% align:center
[KAMEI] Hm? What's that?
Looks impressive.

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:19.444 position:50% align:center
[KATO] Nobody with
a respectable lifestyle

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:21.529 position:50% align:center
would own a car like that.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:33.500 position:50% align:center
Bet this shop would work.

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
Nah.

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.462 position:50% align:center
The joint we scouted earlier
is much better than this one.

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:38.713 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:41.966 position:50% align:center
You sure you're not just
chickening out on me?

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:49.015 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Quite the scene we've got here.

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.059 position:50% align:center
[KAMEI] Apparently,
the prince of the Abura Emirates

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:51.976 position:50% align:center
is in the show.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.353 position:50% align:center
Heard he's a speed demon

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.647 position:50% align:center
who buys cars on a whim
with his family's oil money.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.442 position:50% align:center
[KATO] Hmph. Is it just me, or
is this procession way too long?

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:02.821 position:50% align:center
[KAMEI] Hm. More importantly,
where's Motoyama?

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:06.408 position:50% align:center
[KAMEI]
This sucks.

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:08.284 position:50% align:center
We get worked to the
bone for chump change

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.121 position:50% align:center
and these spoiled millionaires
ride around in luxury.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:12.956 position:50% align:center
Makes me crazy.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.708 position:50% align:center
Money isn't everything.

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.960 position:50% align:center
We do this because
we believe in justice.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:19.045 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah,
I've heard it before.

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.381 position:50% align:center
Talk like that's probably why
you got booted from the First.

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:22.966 position:50% align:center
What was that?!

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:25.301 position:50% align:center
Hey, look.

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.929 position:50% align:center
Speaking of the devil.

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:29.764 position:50% align:center
[YOKO]
Maybe here?

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.142 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI]
No way.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.060 position:50% align:center
That guy definitely
knows some judo.

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:35.729 position:50% align:center
I can tell by his ears.

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:37.731 position:50% align:center
[YOKO]
It's not like we're helpless.

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI] Don't
underestimate martial arts!

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.651 position:50% align:center
Judo chokeholds are hardcore.

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:43.611 position:50% align:center
He could take us
down in an instant.

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:45.864 position:50% align:center
Are you even into this?

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:48.158 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, babe, of course.

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.952 position:50% align:center
Not good. We're
flying blind here.

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:52.996 position:50% align:center
Only 35 minutes left until noon.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.247 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Hoshino!

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.041 position:50% align:center
Fill me in!

00:06:57.417 --> 00:07:00.086 position:50% align:center
Our investigation has
nothing to do with you.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.504 position:50% align:center
So there is a case.

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:03.381 position:50% align:center
Yeah, one for us
in the First Division,

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:06.885 position:50% align:center
not the flunkies they
brought in as backup.

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:09.471 position:50% align:center
Go look for some lost kids.

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:11.931 position:50% align:center
[headphones crackle]

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:14.684 position:50% align:center
Uh? Hey, what are you doing?

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:16.394 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 1A] The man suspected
of targeting the prince

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.521 position:50% align:center
with an explosive
device has been located.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:21.399 position:50% align:center
Target is fleeing, currently
in Ginza District One,

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:23.735 position:50% align:center
heading towards
Tokyo Station. Repeat...

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:26.529 position:50% align:center
What the hell is going on here?

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:27.781 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI]
Like I said,

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:29.991 position:50% align:center
this case has nothing to
do with your department.

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:31.034 position:50% align:center
[headphones crackle]

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.285 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER 1A]
Suspect is in custody!

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:35.038 position:50% align:center
I repeat, suspect is in custody!

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.164 position:50% align:center
[YOKO]
Perfect.

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:38.291 position:50% align:center
The security guard
looks like a grampa.

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:41.086 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI] Think again.
Veteran guards are the worst.

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.421 position:50% align:center
If he's this old,
imagine how much experience

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.256 position:50% align:center
he's gotten over the years.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.177 position:50% align:center
Maybe we'll find a place
guarded by a frail little girl.

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:51.846 position:50% align:center
[YOKO]
I'm over this.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.891 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI]
Huh? No, Yoko, wait!

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:57.310 position:50% align:center
You'd best let me go.

00:07:57.394 --> 00:08:00.605 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI] You're seriously
just gonna abandon me?

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:02.107 position:50% align:center
[YOKO grunts]

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.317 position:50% align:center
It's not my fault you used up
all the syndicate's money!

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:06.444 position:50% align:center
Which you spent on
other girls, I might add!

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:08.363 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you, Yoko.

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:11.074 position:50% align:center
I'm in way over my
head with those guys.

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:13.827 position:50% align:center
If you leave me now, then...

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.954 position:50% align:center
[YOKO grumbles]

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.997 position:50% align:center
Hey! Think that
place could work?

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:21.751 position:50% align:center
Looks bougie, and not
a security guard in sight!

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:23.837 position:50% align:center
[YOKO laughs]

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:27.090 position:50% align:center
[KATO] If there was advance
warning of a possible murder,

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:29.259 position:50% align:center
why didn't you make
them cancel the event?

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.845 position:50% align:center
Naturally, we suggested
they call it off.

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:34.305 position:50% align:center
But the Kantei nixed the idea.

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:36.766 position:50% align:center
The prince is next in
line to become king,

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.269 position:50% align:center
and they insisted he come
to Japan at this time.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.521 position:50% align:center
[KATO] So, postpone the
event and have him come alone.

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:43.732 position:50% align:center
Human lives are at stake here!

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:46.192 position:50% align:center
You haven't changed a bit.

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:47.902 position:50% align:center
You're in a lower division now.

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:51.072 position:50% align:center
Why not stop clinging to
that naive sense of justice?

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:53.450 position:50% align:center
The police operate
as a public office.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:56.327 position:50% align:center
We have to be on good
terms with the government.

00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:59.956 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
You're certain about this?

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.209 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't you maybe prefer
the first or second division?

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:06.212 position:50% align:center
No. I'd like the
role I asked for.

00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:08.089 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course.

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:11.301 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
Hm?

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.136 position:50% align:center
No, I'm fine.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:20.560 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:21.603 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:24.272 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO clears throat]
It's me.

00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:26.066 position:50% align:center
What? You arrested him?

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:28.777 position:50% align:center
What about the bomb?

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.611 position:50% align:center
No one move!

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:30.779 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:31.821 position:50% align:center
Hands above your heads!

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:33.365 position:50% align:center
[BOTH whimper]

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:35.533 position:50% align:center
[YOKO] Put all the money and
jewelry you've got in this bag.

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:36.701 position:50% align:center
[WORKER 1A grunts]

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:39.120 position:50% align:center
Yoko! We don't really
need the jewelry.

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
Might as well take
everything while we're here.

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.708 position:50% align:center
Hurry it up!

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:45.877 position:50% align:center
[WORKER 1A] Um, sorry.
We don't have any jewelry.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.087 position:50% align:center
[YOKO, HIROSHI gasp]

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.588 position:50% align:center
You mocking me, ya prick?!

00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:50.215 position:50% align:center
There's a ton of--

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:52.384 position:50% align:center
[WORKER 1A]
Those are chocolates.

00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.100 position:50% align:center
Huh. They're not very sweet.

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:02.769 position:50% align:center
No, sir, we're actually
famous for our dark chocolate.

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:06.356 position:50% align:center

00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:20.744 position:50% align:center
I'd be completely helpless.

Mornin', guys, Chief.

00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:12.253 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:13.672 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMIZU]
Hm?

00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:16.007 position:50% align:center
You need a report.

00:20:16.091 --> 00:20:18.718 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMIZU] Eh, sounds like
they're good without one.

[KAMEI]
Yo. Did you hear?

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:22.972 position:50% align:center
About what?

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:24.933 position:50% align:center
[KAMEI]
The damages for the bomb case.

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:26.393 position:50% align:center
Apparently everyone involved

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:28.269 position:50% align:center
was reimbursed double
what they were owed.

Ah! I'm so glad you came!

Guys, this is Daisuke Kambe.

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:41.741 position:50% align:center
He'll be joining our
ranks starting today...

00:20:41.825 --> 00:20:43.868 position:50% align:center
It's him...

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMIZU] And he went through
special training in England.

Hey!

00:20:57.048 --> 00:20:59.092 position:50% align:center
What the hell are you doing?

Pardon?

00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:07.017 position:50% align:center
I don't care who you are,
this isn't how things work!

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.643 position:50% align:center
You're not some superhero.

00:21:08.727 --> 00:21:11.730 position:50% align:center
You could've gotten
people killed yesterday!

00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:20.280 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
I see.

00:21:20.363 --> 00:21:23.366 position:50% align:center
