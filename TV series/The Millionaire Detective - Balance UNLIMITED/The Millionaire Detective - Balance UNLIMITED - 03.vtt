I'm Daisuke's
grandmother, Kikuko.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:27.318 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh. Hello, I'm Haru Kato.

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:31.531 position:50% align:center
Haru. What a wonderful
name that is.

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:34.034 position:50% align:center
Thank you for taking
such good care of my boy.

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:35.744 position:50% align:center
Uh. Oh, yeah.

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:38.371 position:50% align:center
We thought you might like a
little souvenir from Hong Kong.

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:39.122 position:50% align:center
Here.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.374 position:50% align:center
Isn't that kind of you?

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.752 position:50% align:center
Why don't we all
enjoy it together, hm?

[whisking]

00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:48.798 position:50% align:center
[KIKUKO]
So, Daisuke.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:52.010 position:50% align:center
Tell me how you're adapting
to your new workplace.

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:55.513 position:50% align:center
Just fine. No concerns.

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:57.515 position:50% align:center
Here you go.

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:01.061 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, my grandson has
grown up to be somewhat selfish.

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:04.314 position:50% align:center
I do hope he hasn't caused
you too much trouble so far.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:05.857 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
No.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.526 position:50% align:center
Daisuke has been a great help
in a lot of ways, actually.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.944 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the tea.

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:16.326 position:50% align:center
Although, his approach to the
job's a little more creative

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.994 position:50% align:center
than the rest of
our department's.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:21.247 position:50% align:center
It's been known
to create minor chaos.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:22.207 position:50% align:center
Daisuke.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.125 position:50% align:center
[KATO gulps]

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:25.502 position:50% align:center
Yes, ma'am?

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:26.795 position:50% align:center
[KIKUKO]
You must refrain from behavior

00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:29.297 position:50% align:center
that causes undue
stress for your coworkers.

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:31.299 position:50% align:center
Such disrespect
will not be tolerated.

00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:32.634 position:50% align:center
Do you understand?

00:01:32.717 --> 00:01:34.052 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:35.220 position:50% align:center
Haru, dear.

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:37.681 position:50% align:center
Pardon my asking,
but what is your age?

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:41.226 position:50% align:center
Oh. I'll be 30 later this year.

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:44.771 position:50% align:center
Not just a senior on the job,
but also a senior in life.

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:46.731 position:50% align:center
I know Daisuke can
learn a lot from you,

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:48.566 position:50% align:center
so please coach him well.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.569 position:50% align:center
[KATO gasps]
Of course, leave it to me!

00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:53.488 position:50% align:center
I'll teach him
everything I know.

00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:56.574 position:50% align:center
He'll be a true policeman
before you know it!

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:58.868 position:50% align:center
What do you say, then?

00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:03.498 position:50% align:center
I look forward to
your... "coaching."

00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:04.874 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.376 position:50% align:center

Hm...

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.215 position:50% align:center
[KIKUKO]
Ah. This is Hattori, our butler.

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:15.468 position:50% align:center
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:16.970 position:50% align:center
The pleasure's mine.

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:20.306 position:50% align:center
[HATTORI] I hope you'll excuse
the unprofessional attire.

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:24.019 position:50% align:center
Not exactly the
most personable man.

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:26.521 position:50% align:center
He spends his time mucking
about in the garden.

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:29.524 position:50% align:center
I wonder if that's a common
hobby in his profession.

00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:32.902 position:50% align:center
So is Hattori the butler
you're always talking to?

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.279 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:37.532 position:50% align:center
That would be the AI butler,
a system called HEUSC.

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:40.368 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
AI? Huh.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:46.166 position:50% align:center
[KATO] I'll be on a business
trip to Nagoya tomorrow.

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.752 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be counting on
you to hold down the fort.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.338 position:50% align:center
Don't cause "undue stress."

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.090 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.426 position:50% align:center
Don't immediately break the

I hate this.

going to see them off properly.

It's really happening, isn't it?

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:51.041 position:50% align:center

What's up?

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:04.554 position:50% align:center
No. I'm fine, thanks.

Nah, go ahead.

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:10.268 position:50% align:center
And now, I have an excuse to
get soba noodles at Shinagawa.

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:12.562 position:50% align:center
The place at the
station's not bad!

Thanks for the food.

But my parents are still letting
me go to prep school in Tokyo.

Oh! For your exams, sure.

Stay back! I will kill her.

I don't think that's true.

Is that what your

[KATO] You want your sister to
have surgery in the US, right?

00:17:37.849 --> 00:17:40.143 position:50% align:center
But a trip like that
doesn't come cheap.

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.312 position:50% align:center
So hijack a train,
get ten million views,

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:43.855 position:50% align:center
and it's paid for.

business! I have no choice.
