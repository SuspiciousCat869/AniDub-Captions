Yesterday, Mikio Umezu,

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:45.977 position:50% align:center
the deputy godfather in charge
of the organized crime group

00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:49.230 position:50% align:center
known as the Gondawara-gumi,
was arrested.

00:19:49.314 --> 00:19:50.565 position:50% align:center
From what I understand,

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:52.901 position:50% align:center
they found a lot
of info on the phone--

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:54.152 position:50% align:center
not just drugs.

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:57.030 position:50% align:center
Stuff about the murder
of Akiko Hoshida, too.

00:19:57.113 --> 00:19:58.531 position:50% align:center

00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:02.827 position:50% align:center
he will be rearrested
for those charges as well

00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:04.079 position:50% align:center
and will face extended
time behind bars.

00:20:04.162 --> 00:20:05.789 position:50% align:center
Come with me.

I don't like it.

Don't like what?

00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:13.046 position:50% align:center
The fact that they're
letting someone like you

I wanna stop criminals.

to be in the First Division.

[KATO grunts]

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:34.609 position:50% align:center
However, during a
siege incident you misfired,

00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:37.821 position:50% align:center
and as a result the target
was seriously injured.

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:40.365 position:50% align:center
And now, you can't
fire a weapon.

00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:42.450 position:50% align:center

to the Modern Crimes unit.
