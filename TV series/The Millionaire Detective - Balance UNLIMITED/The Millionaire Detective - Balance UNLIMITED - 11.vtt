I had a father and a mother.

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:25.233 position:50% align:center
I believe I had
a happy childhood.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.196 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
However, after one fateful day,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.157 position:50% align:center
everything changed.

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:38.288 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] After that day,
the world felt hollow.

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.499 position:50% align:center
I was bored by
every facet of my life.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.171 position:50% align:center

Until one day...

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.843 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] ...I discovered
what I needed to do.

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:02.520 position:50% align:center

In Japan, I found purpose.

Hey, you!

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.656 position:50% align:center
Are you out of your damn mind?!

obstruction of just-- [coughs]

Daisuke Kambe.

00:01:22.707 --> 00:01:24.751 position:50% align:center
As of today,
I'm inspector of the

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:27.545 position:50% align:center

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:13.151 position:50% align:center

Update me.

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:14.569 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE]
The signal from the SRV-Bug

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:16.029 position:50% align:center
is no longer broadcasting,

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:19.324 position:50% align:center

any humans inside.

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.370 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Wait.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:38.218 position:50% align:center
Put your gun away.
He's no longer here.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:40.053 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Huh?

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.432 position:50% align:center
Where are we?

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:46.559 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] Shigemaru Kambe
was researching adollium

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.645 position:50% align:center
in this facility.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.147 position:50% align:center
We'll split up
and search for clues.

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:54.984 position:50% align:center
[KATO] What am I supposed
to be looking for?

00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:59.447 position:50% align:center

Guess I'll start upstairs.

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:14.731 position:50% align:center
Be honest.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:17.442 position:50% align:center
You're doing this 'cause
you want revenge, right?

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:20.820 position:50% align:center
You're wrong.

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:23.698 position:50% align:center
I just want to know
the truth of what happened.

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:44.552 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait.

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:49.265 position:50% align:center
[KATO grunts, gasps]

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:55.689 position:50% align:center

Isn't this your house?

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.985 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE]
Master Daisuke.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.324 position:50% align:center
Is everything all right?

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:07.575 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.078 position:50% align:center
Hold up!

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.913 position:50% align:center
Mr. Kato.

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:13.957 position:50% align:center
Thank you for your assistance.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.042 position:50% align:center
Oh, sure.

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:33.977 position:50% align:center
My father was left-handed.
But you use your right.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.735 position:50% align:center
Clever. So perceptive.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:44.404 position:50% align:center
[KATO gasps]

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:55.707 position:50% align:center
Of course, I would expect
nothing less from his son.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.209 position:50% align:center
The butler?!

00:06:58.293 --> 00:07:00.837 position:50% align:center
You're the one
who's behind this.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:08.928 position:50% align:center
Tell me why.

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:12.766 position:50% align:center
[sighs] The men in this
family are all talk.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:16.061 position:50% align:center
Their words are
usually just for show.

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:18.980 position:50% align:center
Haru. I should
have known better.

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:23.026 position:50% align:center
If only I'd gotten Daisuke away
from your influence earlier.

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:31.201 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but I must
place you under arrest.

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.453 position:50% align:center
Even if this were
to go to trial,

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:37.415 position:50% align:center
it would take at least ten years
for them to agree on a verdict.

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:40.168 position:50% align:center
I'd be dead before
I was sentenced.

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:42.504 position:50% align:center
Besides...

00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:44.089 position:50% align:center
...how would this
scandal reflect

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
on the heir of the Kambe family?

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:49.386 position:50% align:center
Why was it so imperative
that my mother be murdered?

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:52.389 position:50% align:center
And was my father the
one that took her life?

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.437 position:50% align:center
[KIKUKO] If only he had
that much nerve in him.

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:00.522 position:50% align:center
[SAYURI]
Are you going to continue

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.691 position:50% align:center
hiding the existence
of adollium?

00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:04.609 position:50% align:center
Just so the family
can make more money?

00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:09.572 position:50% align:center
We cannot publicize my research.
You're well aware of that!

00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:14.869 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMARU]
Sayuri!

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.348 position:50% align:center
[HATTORI] Master Shigemaru
has left the grounds.

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:38.101 position:50% align:center
He's likely heading to see her.

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:42.230 position:50% align:center
[KIKUKO]
We have no other choice.

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.327 position:50% align:center
Sayuri?

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.049 position:50% align:center
Sayuri...

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:19.434 position:50% align:center
[HATTORI] We should depart,
Master Shigemaru.

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:26.858 position:50% align:center
What have you done?

00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:29.986 position:50% align:center

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:36.159 position:50% align:center

I'll never forgive you.

[KIKUKO]
Hm.

[HATTORI groans]

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:46.169 position:50% align:center
Is there something
I can help you with, sir?

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:52.217 position:50% align:center
You're the one who killed
Cho and Takei, aren't you?

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.927 position:50% align:center
In cold blood!

You're under arrest

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:08.441 position:50% align:center

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:29.045 position:50% align:center
Is he alive?
Where are you hiding him?

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:30.380 position:50% align:center
It's unfortunate.

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:33.174 position:50% align:center
He allowed himself
to be led astray.

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:35.301 position:50% align:center
Distracted by that woman.

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:37.178 position:50% align:center
He attempted to
follow her in death

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:39.180 position:50% align:center
and look what happened.

[KIKUKO]
Have a seat.

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:56.489 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Mother was murdered

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:59.993 position:50% align:center
because she wanted the public
to know that adollium existed.

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:03.163 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
She lost her life...

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:05.165 position:50% align:center
...along with Chief Takei...

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:07.375 position:50% align:center
...and Cho.

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:11.338 position:50% align:center
My duty is to make sure
their deaths weren't in vain.

How are you progressing?

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:21.056 position:50% align:center
I'm decoding the data.
Give me two more minutes.

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:22.265 position:50% align:center
Prepare to send the files

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:25.185 position:50% align:center
to every nation's top
research institutes.

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50% align:center
Ah, adollium.

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:33.026 position:50% align:center
It's so similar to how we used
to view plutonium in the past.

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:36.029 position:50% align:center
It could be the source
of unlimited energy,

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:40.075 position:50% align:center
or become a weapon that
devastates the world.

00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:43.203 position:50% align:center
Do you understand what
it is you're about to do?

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:47.165 position:50% align:center
What could happen when
people learn of its existence?

00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:06.017 position:50% align:center
[HATTORI]
Please stop, Mister Kato.

00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:09.229 position:50% align:center

You should get treatment
right away, though.

00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:01.336 position:50% align:center
I did.

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:02.837 position:50% align:center
How come?

I'm not saying that I don't
wanna work with you, Hoshino.

00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:17.811 position:50% align:center
It's just, I can do good

Well, I was kind of ashamed.
