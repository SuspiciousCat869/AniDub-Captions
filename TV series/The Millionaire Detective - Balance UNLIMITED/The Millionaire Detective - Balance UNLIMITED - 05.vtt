[HOSHINO]
Look alive!

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:25.190 position:50% align:center
As soon as we're ready,
we'll enter the embassy!

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:28.902 position:50% align:center
Is somethin' up?

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:30.945 position:50% align:center
A few moments ago, the
First Investigation Division

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:33.698 position:50% align:center
received a request for
security escorts from inside.

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:35.658 position:50% align:center
Why? If you're
putting vests on..

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:37.660 position:50% align:center
I'm not giving you
any more information.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:39.746 position:50% align:center
Just stay out of our way.

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:43.333 position:50% align:center
Damn.

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:46.544 position:50% align:center
No sweat, right? This way
we're not in real danger.

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.713 position:50% align:center
He's got a point.

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:54.302 position:50% align:center
We're going to do we can
to diffuse the situation.

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:00.642 position:50% align:center
Here we are.

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:05.271 position:50% align:center
Now, Ricardo, that's the
only key to get inside there.

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.357 position:50% align:center
Don't let anybody
through without my orders,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.733 position:50% align:center
you understand?

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:10.235 position:50% align:center
You have my word.

[BODYGUARD 5A grunts]

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.912 position:50% align:center
This is the
embassy's panic room.

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:22.789 position:50% align:center
It was built to
withstand attacks

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:24.833 position:50% align:center
from weapons of

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:26.751 position:50% align:center
Why are we suddenly on alert?

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:28.086 position:50% align:center
[BODYGUARD 5A]
While you were talking,

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:30.880 position:50% align:center
we came across the corpse
of this embassy's chef.

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:32.048 position:50% align:center
A murder?

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:33.299 position:50% align:center
[BODYGUARD 5A]
Please don't worry.

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:35.301 position:50% align:center
We've sought assistance
from the Japanese police

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:38.513 position:50% align:center
and are currently investigating
using all of our resources.

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:41.349 position:50% align:center
Where exactly was
the body discovered?

00:10:43.727 --> 00:10:45.520 position:50% align:center
[ALVAREZ]
Well? Tell him.

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:49.232 position:50% align:center
In an employee hallway
located near the kitchen.

[DAISUKE]
HEUSC, give me a live feed.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.493 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] There doesn't
seem to be that much blood

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:01.911 position:50% align:center
for a stabbing victim.

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:04.122 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's possible he was
murdered somewhere else

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:06.875 position:50% align:center
and then transported
over here by the killer.

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:15.759 position:50% align:center
So, remind me why we're
walking the perimeter.

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:18.887 position:50% align:center
[KATO] Hm? I need
a closer look at that.

Don't get your dirty

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:27.479 position:50% align:center

00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:19.614 position:50% align:center
[HEUSC] I'm detecting
a powerful radio jammer

00:12:19.698 --> 00:12:22.242 position:50% align:center
located in the parking lot
adjacent to the embassy.

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:26.329 position:50% align:center
Its effective range
is an 800-meter radius.

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:27.956 position:50% align:center
Explain what's going on!

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:31.292 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure the reason,
but our communications are down.

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:33.253 position:50% align:center
[ALVAREZ] What do you
mean you don't know why?

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
Considering this
and the chef's murder...

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:38.258 position:50% align:center
Can you restore them?

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:40.635 position:50% align:center
[HEUSC] I'm afraid I have
no way of doing that.

00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:44.806 position:50% align:center
However, it seems Lady Suzue
has noticed something is amiss.

Her estimated time of arrival

It's an organic
