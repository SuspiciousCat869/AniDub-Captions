some kind of interference field.

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:27.067 position:50% align:center

How do I stop the interference?

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:33.323 position:50% align:center
The total displacement of

But the engine is extremely
quiet and there's no exhaust.

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:40.121 position:50% align:center
I suspect that whatever
nullified your equipment,

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:43.625 position:50% align:center

is also powering this ship.

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:45.960 position:50% align:center

If my understanding is right,

it's the device
powering the ship.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE] The seawater
powers the generator

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:09.979 position:50% align:center

an adollium reactor

out for the cooling unit.

it should disrupt the generator

It's the red pipe! Shoot it!

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:05.679 position:50% align:center
Kind of a nuisance, aren'tcha?

But since you showed up...

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.456 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.042 position:50% align:center
I'm just a civil servant.

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:41.214 position:50% align:center
Give me a break!

Surely, you get it! Don't you?!

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:49.806 position:50% align:center

I'll come home alive.

can't use the jammer now.

this as a detective?
