Master Daisuke?

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:21.229 position:50% align:center
Master Daisuke!

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:22.522 position:50% align:center
Come back!

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:25.108 position:50% align:center
Master Daisuke,
where are you going?

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:27.402 position:50% align:center
Talk to me!

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.823 position:50% align:center
Master Daisuke.

Hey, you got a sec?

00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:16.261 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.973 position:50% align:center
Hurry up and get
to the point already.

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:22.267 position:50% align:center
[KATO sighs] Sorry to do
this while you're off-duty,

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.185 position:50% align:center
but could you give me
a hand with something?

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.647 position:50% align:center
It's not like I really need
your help or anything, but...

00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:31.067 position:50% align:center
It may take me a
while to get there.

[horn sounds]

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:45.248 position:50% align:center
[HATTORI] Um, I can drop you off
at the park entrance instead.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.625 position:50% align:center
No, this is fine.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.590 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Well? What do you need me for?

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.342 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Hey. Sorry, man.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.260 position:50% align:center
Will you quit
beating around the bush?

[TSUYOSHI]
Hm?

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:07.145 position:50% align:center
[TSUYOSHI]
Is this the guy?

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:08.313 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:12.067 position:50% align:center
Please, sir.
Can you find Shiro for me?

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.443 position:50% align:center
You'll have to explain.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.945 position:50% align:center
Shiro's missing,
and I need your help!

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.197 position:50% align:center
It's a puppy.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.949 position:50% align:center
Like I said, not
exactly life or death here.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.159 position:50% align:center
But I thought maybe you could

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:24.412 position:50% align:center
use your AI butler thing
to help us find him.

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:26.331 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
What are his characteristics?

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:27.624 position:50% align:center
Sounds like he's on board.

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.292 position:50% align:center
Can you tell him
what Shiro looks like?

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:30.627 position:50% align:center
[TSUYOSHI] Okay.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.713 position:50% align:center
He's all white and
really small and cute!

00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:35.632 position:50% align:center
[KATO] The leash came unhooked
while they were playing,

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.550 position:50% align:center
and the dog took off.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.854 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE grunts]

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:50.939 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
I can't help you.

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:52.691 position:50% align:center
Come on, I'm giving
you an easy one.

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:54.943 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't this be
a total cakewalk for you?

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:57.570 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
I'm not doing so well today.

00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:00.490 position:50% align:center
Does that mean he
can't do magic after all?

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:01.866 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
"Magic"?

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.952 position:50% align:center
What you can do is basically
magic to normal people.

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.912 position:50% align:center
We can't all buy our powers.

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:07.080 position:50% align:center
Please, mister.

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:10.166 position:50% align:center
Will you still help
me look for Shiro?

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.503 position:50% align:center
Police officers don't
exist to look for dogs.

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:16.673 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:17.924 position:50% align:center
[TSUYOSHI]
He's gone...

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:19.384 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec.

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:22.137 position:50% align:center
Stop being a jerk and we can
get this over with, okay?

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.888 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Unfortunately, I can't help you.

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:26.850 position:50% align:center
[TSUYOSHI wailing]

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.602 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE groans]
Fine.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.521 position:50% align:center
I'll look for it.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:32.856 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.149 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Don't make me repeat myself.

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:36.359 position:50% align:center
[TSUYOSHI]
All right!

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:39.320 position:50% align:center
You said it and we all heard ya!
No take-backs allowed.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:40.989 position:50% align:center
You got that, mister?

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:43.199 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Hey, you have a heart after all.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.618 position:50% align:center
He pulled the same
dirty trick on me.

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:47.662 position:50% align:center
[KATO] That's Tsuyoshi Nomura.

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:49.247 position:50% align:center
He's in the fourth grade.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.374 position:50% align:center
Remember this is a
promise between men!

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:52.584 position:50% align:center
If you lie, I'll tell Lord Enma!

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.336 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] Which way
is your house from here?

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
Uh. It's over that way.

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:58.048 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Let's go.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:01.468 position:50% align:center
But why, though?! Shiro
took off in that direction!

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.011 position:50% align:center
No, that was merely pretense.

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:04.554 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:06.348 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] He likely ran off
in a different direction

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:07.307 position:50% align:center
to tease you.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.641 position:50% align:center
[TSUYOSHI grunts]

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:10.894 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] I'm sure he went
back home ahead of you.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:13.605 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Dude, have you ever met a dog?

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:15.815 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
That's just how they are.

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:17.525 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
So that's a no, then.

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:20.570 position:50% align:center
I hope so, but I don't
think he knows the way back.

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:23.448 position:50% align:center
Do you always go this route when
you take him out for his walks?

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:26.785 position:50% align:center
I haven't had him long, I just
got him from Mr. Satomura.

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:27.869 position:50% align:center
Satomura?

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:29.412 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.748 position:50% align:center
He lives in our neighborhood
and owns a whole bunch of dogs.

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:33.917 position:50% align:center
Very likely he's
a breeder, then.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.710 position:50% align:center
A dog's sense
of smell is infinitely

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:37.295 position:50% align:center
more powerful than a human's.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.714 position:50% align:center
It's impossible
for one to get lost.

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:42.175 position:50% align:center
I'm sure by now he's already
on your doorstep napping.

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:44.302 position:50% align:center
Really? Nice, let's go!

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:46.596 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.474 position:50% align:center
You don't really believe
that dog went home.

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:53.019 position:50% align:center
Sure, but that's not
my problem to solve anymore.

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:58.108 position:50% align:center
What should I do?

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.360 position:50% align:center
He's still not back,
and I haven't heard from him.

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:02.445 position:50% align:center
You worry too much, Suzue.

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:05.281 position:50% align:center
It's not like he's
a lost puppy, you know.

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:06.324 position:50% align:center
I know...

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:07.909 position:50% align:center
[HATTORI]
Is something the matter?

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:10.203 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE] Master Daisuke bolted
out of the house this morning

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:11.621 position:50% align:center
and hasn't returned.

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.998 position:50% align:center
[HATTORI] He was summoned
by his coworker, Mr. Kato,

00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:15.667 position:50% align:center
so I dropped him
off at the park.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.085 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE gasps]

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
[HATTORI] However, he left
his phone inside the car.

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:21.214 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:22.924 position:50% align:center
No HEUSC and no cell phone.

00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:25.301 position:50% align:center
He even left his
wallet behind today.

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
What will he do now?

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:28.596 position:50% align:center
He'll be quite all right.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.266 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he'll return
once he gets hungry.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:35.645 position:50% align:center
I suppose. But you said
yourself, he's not a dog.

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:39.107 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
How much farther to your house?

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.525 position:50% align:center
[TSUYOSHI]
Why? Are ya tired?

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:43.778 position:50% align:center
I didn't think you were
such a lazy old man.

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:48.575 position:50% align:center
[KATO] You sure came
a long way for your dog walk.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:51.036 position:50% align:center
[TSUYOSHI] That's because
it's close to Satoru's house.

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:52.954 position:50% align:center

Hm.

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:55.498 position:50% align:center

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.250 position:50% align:center
Uh!

Hey, this is someone's house!

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:06.009 position:50% align:center
[TSUYOSHI] Like I care!
Shiro's gonna get away!

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:07.469 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Leave him be.

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:09.262 position:50% align:center
But he's trespassing.

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:10.847 position:50% align:center
That's nothing
the police can't handle.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.683 position:50% align:center
We are the police, idiot!

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you
saw him run in here?

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:21.983 position:50% align:center
Huh? Are you
stupid or somethin'?

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:23.651 position:50% align:center

I lie about that?

Come here, boy! [chuckles]

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:44.130 position:50% align:center
This is our family cat, Yuki.

inconvenience, ma'am!

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:53.431 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Well, guess he ran off.

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:54.808 position:50% align:center
It'll be all right.

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:57.268 position:50% align:center
But let's head
home for now, yeah?

00:07:57.352 --> 00:07:58.728 position:50% align:center
And don't worry too much.

there like Kambe said.

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:23.003 position:50% align:center
Thanks for taking care of him.

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:24.379 position:50% align:center
See ya, bud.

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:25.213 position:50% align:center
Mister!

00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:26.756 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Hm?

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.136 position:50% align:center
You better keep looking for
Shiro like you promised, okay?

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:34.597 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Man of my word.

00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:43.064 position:50% align:center
"Hey, Haru, help the kid
out, it won't take all day."

[yelps]

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:48.194 position:50% align:center
[KATO] I thought you
had already gone home.

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:50.905 position:50% align:center
Sorry to make you tag along
when you were off-duty.

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:52.949 position:50% align:center
I can handle the rest myself.

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:58.121 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
You wanna eat?

00:08:58.204 --> 00:08:59.247 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
No.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.790 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Right, I bet you have a steak

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:03.043 position:50% align:center
waiting for you in your mansion.

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:04.794 position:50% align:center
See ya.

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.296 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
That's not it.

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.548 position:50% align:center
'Kay, then what's the problem?

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:11.426 position:50% align:center
I don't have... money.

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:17.057 position:50% align:center
I guess that explains why
you can't do magic today.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.018 position:50% align:center
Here. This'll cover
your train fare.

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:36.076 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] I appreciate it...
but I can't go home now.

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:37.577 position:50% align:center
[KATO yelps]

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:43.917 position:50% align:center
[KIKUKO]
It seems like he doesn't

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.044 position:50% align:center
intend to return home tonight.

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:47.420 position:50% align:center
I wonder.

00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:48.880 position:50% align:center
Maybe he didn't like the pattern

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:50.548 position:50% align:center
on the shirt I gave
him this morning.

00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:53.259 position:50% align:center
Or maybe he's upset
that I woke him up

00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:55.261 position:50% align:center
three minutes
earlier than usual.

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:57.055 position:50% align:center
It could be that I suggested

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:58.848 position:50% align:center
he have seconds
twice during his meal.

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
[KIKUKO] Oh, no. I can
guarantee that it's because

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:03.853 position:50% align:center
his breakfast this
morning had some <i>natto</i> .

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:05.772 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE]
But surely Master Daisuke knows

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:07.565 position:50% align:center
we're thinking about his health!

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.442 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Perhaps
he noticed I switched

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:11.903 position:50% align:center
his shoes from a five
to a seven-centimeter lift!

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:15.323 position:50% align:center
[KIKUKO chuckles]
Yes, I'm sure that must be it.

00:10:15.407 --> 00:10:18.451 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE yells]
I've ruined everything!

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:20.120 position:50% align:center
[KIKUKO]
This will be a good experience.

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:21.996 position:50% align:center
He knows so little of the world.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.915 position:50% align:center
And he won't be alone
since Haru is with him.

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:25.458 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE gasps]

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:30.171 position:50% align:center
[KATO] Did something
happen at your place?

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:37.470 position:50% align:center
[KATO] Not that you're a bother
or anything, I'm just curious.

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:40.890 position:50% align:center
Just take one.

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:43.226 position:50% align:center
Can't, gotta check the dates.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:46.354 position:50% align:center
I understand. So you make
sure you buy a newer carton.

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:47.731 position:50% align:center
Nope, the opposite.

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:50.108 position:50% align:center
They toss 'em out when
they're past the expiration,

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:52.402 position:50% align:center
and I drink the whole
thing in two days anyway.

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.696 position:50% align:center
Okay, gotta find roux.

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:58.033 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Do you always shop for yourself?

00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course I do.

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.619 position:50% align:center
I mean, who do you
think would do it for me?

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:03.246 position:50% align:center
I assume it would
be more efficient

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:06.124 position:50% align:center
to have someone else in
your household handle it.

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:08.710 position:50% align:center
I get it. It must be
nice to have a wife.

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:10.253 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
A wife?

00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:12.714 position:50% align:center
So what's the deal? You two
have an argument or something?

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:14.090 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Argument with who?

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:16.634 position:50% align:center
What did you and
Suzue fight about?

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.511 position:50% align:center
Suzue is just family.

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:19.637 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Family?

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.056 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:24.642 position:50% align:center
Uh! Right! You're related, duh!

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:28.855 position:50% align:center
I get it, of course
you are. [laughs]

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:40.325 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Hm? What are you doing?

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
This... is where you live?

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:45.955 position:50% align:center
[KATO] What, you got
a problem with that?

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.374 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
No.

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center
You can move any of
the clutter if you need to.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.634 position:50% align:center
This building is
really where you live?

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:00.095 position:50% align:center
You're welcome to leave!

00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:02.889 position:50% align:center
I gotta start the rice first.

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:06.101 position:50% align:center
How 'bout you chop potatoes
and carrots for me?

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.739 position:50% align:center
Hey. Hurry up so
we can eat sooner.

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:26.705 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
I need help.

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:28.206 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
What's wrong?

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:30.417 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] I injured myself.
Bring me the first aid box.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.379 position:50% align:center
[KATO] What? I don't have one,
just lick it or something.

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:54.482 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Is this really all you have?

00:12:54.566 --> 00:12:57.819 position:50% align:center
You know, you've done nothing
but complain the entire day.

00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:02.866 position:50% align:center
Great, let's eat.

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:11.082 position:50% align:center
Thank you for the meal.

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:18.089 position:50% align:center
It's tasty.

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:24.679 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:13:24.763 --> 00:13:26.431 position:50% align:center
It's potato <i>soju</i> .

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:28.266 position:50% align:center
Just take a drink.

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.900 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Hm.

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:39.486 position:50% align:center
Hey, look at you,
holding your liquor.

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:41.071 position:50% align:center
Check it out.

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:44.991 position:50% align:center
I bought some dry-cured ham that
might suit your wealthy palate.

This is wholly inedible.

But that cost me 1,500 yen!

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:55.919 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] The only dry-cured
ham I eat is Jamon Iberico.

Bean sprouts!

00:14:05.512 --> 00:14:09.015 position:50% align:center
Then you pour in some soy sauce
and mix in a ton of wasabi.

00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:10.600 position:50% align:center
And lastly.

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:13.687 position:50% align:center

Let me go, Director! Please!

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:43.591 position:50% align:center
Not a chance. We'll
wait for authorization.

00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:44.843 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:46.678 position:50% align:center
Nothing gets solved by
bureaucratic red tape!

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:48.972 position:50% align:center
We can't hesitate
to carry out justice.

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:51.683 position:50% align:center
We're heroes first and
civil servants second!

Don't be so naiïve.

00:14:53.268 --> 00:14:56.896 position:50% align:center
This is not a detective agency.
We're a police department.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:01.234 position:50% align:center
So be it, but you're
a disgrace to the badge! [gasps]

Being a civil servant.

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:26.009 position:50% align:center
And trying to be a hero.

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:28.595 position:50% align:center
You get it, right, Kambe?

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:29.721 position:50% align:center
What's there to get?

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:35.352 position:50% align:center
Being a public servant,
but also a hero!

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:37.645 position:50% align:center
Can you do something like that?

00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:40.732 position:50% align:center
It's just hard to
figure out, y'know?

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:50.992 position:50% align:center
So, hey, you're the heir to
the Kambe Group, aren't you?

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:53.161 position:50% align:center
Why did you come
to our department?

To our...

I thought you specifically
asked for Modern Crimes.

'Cause this department
is perfect for a temp job.

[KIKUKO]
That seems excessive.

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:46.756 position:50% align:center
I know. But he's never
spent an entire night

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.967 position:50% align:center
away from home
with no money on hand.

I don't have much of a choice.

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:50.445 position:50% align:center
Hey, is <i>natto</i>
and miso soup okay?

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:52.238 position:50% align:center
[grunts] <i>Natto</i> , huh?

00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:54.991 position:50% align:center
[KATO] Don't be a baby.
It's good for you.

00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:57.160 position:50% align:center
Besides...

00:17:57.243 --> 00:18:00.705 position:50% align:center
It's another Kato family
special. [chuckles]

00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:04.918 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Sorry to make you tag along.

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:08.296 position:50% align:center
You realize there's almost
no chance of finding that dog.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.049 position:50% align:center
[KATO] Well, I'll have
to see what I can do.

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:12.509 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.471 position:50% align:center
[door opens, closes]

00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:57.846 position:50% align:center
You did good. I know
someone's gonna find him soon.

00:18:57.929 --> 00:18:59.347 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:00.306 position:50% align:center
[dog barking]

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:01.850 position:50% align:center
--[KATO] Hm?
--[TSUYOSHI gasps]

00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:08.606 position:50% align:center
[TSUYOSHI laughs]
Shiro!

00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:12.402 position:50% align:center
Hey, buddy! Where'd you go, huh?

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:15.280 position:50% align:center
Nice job. Where'd you find him?

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:17.157 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Satomura, the breeder.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.742 position:50% align:center
[KATO gasps]

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:22.245 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] That's a littermate of
the dog he's been looking for.

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:24.247 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he can't
tell the two apart,

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.833 position:50% align:center
but you should
inform his parents.

00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:29.878 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You're totally
missing the point here!

00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:31.880 position:50% align:center
Not every problem can be solved
by throwing money at it--

00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:33.757 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Shiro is no longer alive.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.966 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:36.968 position:50% align:center
I called the health
center for this ward.

00:19:37.052 --> 00:19:38.303 position:50% align:center
After his leash came unhooked,

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:40.180 position:50% align:center
Shiro ran out into the street.

00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:42.891 position:50% align:center
He was hit by a car.

00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:45.310 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Fifty thousand yen, plus tax.

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:47.937 position:50% align:center
Pay him by the end of the day.

00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:49.522 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:49.606 --> 00:19:54.361 position:50% align:center
Shiro! I missed you so, so much!
Don't ever run away again, okay?

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:56.571 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
I'm taking the day off.

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:57.405 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Headed home?

00:19:57.489 --> 00:19:58.656 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Yeah.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.160 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't make them
worry about me too much.

00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:05.580 position:50% align:center
Kato?

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:07.457 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.459 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Do me a favor.

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:11.753 position:50% align:center
The train fare.

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:25.684 position:50% align:center
Ah, welcome home, sir.

00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:27.852 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:31.398 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:36.403 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Master Daisuke!

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:39.823 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:41.533 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
I have returned.

00:20:41.616 --> 00:20:43.034 position:50% align:center
Yes, welcome back.

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:44.994 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to see
that you're safe.

00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:48.289 position:50% align:center
This is needlessly formal
for such a trivial outing.

00:20:48.373 --> 00:20:49.541 position:50% align:center
[KIKUKO giggles]

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:52.127 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Suzue.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.962 position:50% align:center
Are you hungry yet?

00:20:54.045 --> 00:20:56.464 position:50% align:center
On top of your <i>natto</i> ,
add some mayonnaise,

00:20:56.548 --> 00:20:58.925 position:50% align:center
a soft-boiled egg, and mix.

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:00.385 position:50% align:center
Finally,

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:02.846 position:50% align:center
top it off with a bit of
freshly cracked black pepper.

00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:04.681 position:50% align:center
[HEUSC]
Two hundred and forty-six yen.

00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:06.057 position:50% align:center
Balance: Unlimited.

00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:08.393 position:50% align:center
I said hush!

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:15.400 position:50% align:center
Uh... thank you for this meal.

00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:29.164 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE] This is delicious,
Master Daisuke!

00:21:29.247 --> 00:21:32.250 position:50% align:center
They call it,
"The Devil's <i>Natto</i> Rice."
