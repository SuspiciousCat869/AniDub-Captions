00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:35.827 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
We're going to the station.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.830 position:50% align:center
And you're answering every
last one of my questions.

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:40.498 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
I refuse.

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:41.583 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
What?

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.626 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
This is a family matter.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.087 position:50% align:center
It has nothing to do with you.

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:47.547 position:50% align:center
So what are you saying?

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.507 position:50% align:center
You aren't handling
this as a detective?

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.073 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Why him?

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.200 position:50% align:center
Cho deserved so
much better than this.

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.791 position:50% align:center
We'll find the guy who
murdered him and Takei.

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.293 position:50% align:center
No matter what it takes.

00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:50.587 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMIZU]
In that case...

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.422 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't we be
working with Kambe?

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.132 position:50% align:center
I know the circumstances
are strange,

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:55.717 position:50% align:center
but he gets things done.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.137 position:50% align:center
We could sure use
his tech and resources.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.264 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Forget about him.

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:02.766 position:50% align:center
He's no longer on the force.

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:07.687 position:50% align:center
How do you plan on going
after the perp, then?

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:16.821 position:50% align:center
[YUMOTO] I recognize those.
They're Cho's.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.451 position:50% align:center
That's weird.
He always had a pair.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:25.246 position:50% align:center
Yup, there are two
components to a wiretap.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.457 position:50% align:center
This one is the receiver.

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:32.295 position:50% align:center
[KAMEI] How does something
like that work?

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.255 position:50% align:center
That must be why he
didn't run when the killer

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:35.382 position:50% align:center
showed up.

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50% align:center
That's right. Whether Kambe
had rushed back or not,

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.102 position:50% align:center
Cho was never going
to back down.

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:52.357 position:50% align:center
Hoshino. What do you want?

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.193 position:50% align:center
Inspector Kato.
You're coming with us.

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:58.655 position:50% align:center
Since you're a material witness
to Takei and Nakamoto's murders,

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:00.407 position:50% align:center
we're now taking
you into custody.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.616 position:50% align:center
You're what, now?!

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:04.619 position:50% align:center
Hands off! C'mon!

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:06.830 position:50% align:center
Everyone else at Modern
Crimes will stand by

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:09.249 position:50% align:center
for the time being and refrain
from getting involved.

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:10.959 position:50% align:center
We'll hold on to the
car keys for a while

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:12.585 position:50% align:center
just to be on the safe side.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:13.670 position:50% align:center
[KAMEI]
Hold on!

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
What's the meaning
of this, Hoshino?

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:17.924 position:50% align:center
Where is Inspector Kambe?

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:21.386 position:50% align:center
He's also a material
witness in this case.

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.346 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] You can't keep secrets
from us just because

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.098 position:50% align:center
he's part of the Kambe family.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.185 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE] That's him.
The man who was here.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.562 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:33.148 position:50% align:center
There's not more security
footage from that night?

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:36.026 position:50% align:center
The intruder forcibly
shut down all our systems,

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.653 position:50% align:center
which also took
our cameras offline.

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
But still. I saw him
with my own eyes.

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:43.950 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] This person
infiltrated our home using a

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:46.703 position:50% align:center
level of access that only
members of the Kambe family

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.204 position:50% align:center
are authorized to have.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.372 position:50% align:center
Think about it.

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:50.623 position:50% align:center
Only one person could
do that other than

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:53.376 position:50% align:center
the two of us.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.962 position:50% align:center
There's no way it was Shigemaru.

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:59.883 position:50% align:center
He swore, 19 years ago.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.760 position:50% align:center
You knew he was alive.

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
Meaning you've lied
all this time.

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.765 position:50% align:center
Why do that?

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:09.559 position:50% align:center
It's natural for a parent
to protect their child.

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
And of course, my son
had his own reasons

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.396 position:50% align:center
to disappear.

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.320 position:50% align:center
In that case...

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:22.030 position:50% align:center
Don't you think it's natural
for a child whose mother

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:24.407 position:50% align:center
was murdered to have a
grudge against her killer?

00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:41.424 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
I'm going after him.

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:43.343 position:50% align:center
Don't forget that he
intentionally showed me

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:44.427 position:50% align:center
his face.

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:46.680 position:50% align:center
It's possible this
is just a trap.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:49.641 position:50% align:center
Besides. I'm certain
we can't trust HEUSC.

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:52.060 position:50% align:center
Inform me the moment
you pick up his trail.

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:53.978 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE] But if he's planning
on you coming after him,

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:55.063 position:50% align:center
you're in danger--

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:56.523 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
What do I care?

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:10.161 position:50% align:center
I'm starving.

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:13.248 position:50% align:center
Can I get those keys so I can
grab some lunch real fast?

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:14.290 position:50% align:center
[M INVESTIGATOR A]
Huh?

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:15.333 position:50% align:center
[KAMEI chuckles]

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:16.710 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMIZU]
Oh, Kamei.

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:19.045 position:50% align:center
The kebab truck
is open at the park.

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.506 position:50% align:center
How 'bout you grab us some?

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:24.676 position:50% align:center
Good idea. On it. Be right back.

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:29.848 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMIZU]
You over there.

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.935 position:50% align:center
[M INVESTIGATOR A]
Yes sir, did you need something?

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:37.188 position:50% align:center
Could you hold on to this
while the glue sets?

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center
It'll be ruined if the pieces
move before it dries,

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.484 position:50% align:center
so don't put it down.

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:44.112 position:50% align:center
[MAHORO] I'm going to run out
and buy some lunch, too!

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:45.155 position:50% align:center
[YUMOTO]
Yeah. Same.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.614 position:50% align:center
[M INVESTIGATOR A]
What?

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:48.408 position:50% align:center
Hey, uh... No. Wait!

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMIZU]
Ah, don't worry about them.

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:52.245 position:50% align:center
They can't get into trouble.

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:53.705 position:50% align:center
They don't even have a car.

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:03.089 position:50% align:center
[KAMEI] Saeki, where on Earth
did you get this from?

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:06.634 position:50% align:center
The General Affairs director.

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:08.762 position:50% align:center
No...

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:10.263 position:50% align:center
It's no good.

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:12.932 position:50% align:center
Maybe the signal from
the die is too weak.

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:14.893 position:50% align:center
You're gonna have to take
the antennae and climb up

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:16.144 position:50% align:center
onto the roof.

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:17.228 position:50% align:center
You're joking!

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:21.399 position:50% align:center
My clothes are
going to be filthy.

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:23.860 position:50% align:center
Don't get caught by the coppers!

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:26.279 position:50% align:center
Hilarious. We're the cops.

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:27.947 position:50% align:center
[ONLOOKERS laughing]

00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:30.950 position:50% align:center
[KAMEI] Why does it feel as
though I'm being punished?

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:32.410 position:50% align:center
No good!

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:34.204 position:50% align:center
Get that thing as high in
the air as you possibly can!

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.830 position:50% align:center
Your height is like
your one good trait.

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
[MAHORO] Give us a spin!
That might help.

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:47.550 position:50% align:center
Mommy! What's that
crazy man doing?

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:48.760 position:50% align:center
[MOM]
Don't look at him.

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.137 position:50% align:center
[KAMEI chuckles]

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:58.103 position:50% align:center
[MAHORO] Nice work, Kamei!
I caught the signal!

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:01.439 position:50% align:center
Whatever you do, don't move!
Stay in that position!

00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:03.733 position:50% align:center
[ONLOOKERS laughing]

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:04.943 position:50% align:center
[KAMEI]
Please hurry.

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:10.824 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE]
I've got him!

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:17.872 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE]
Vehicle located.

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:20.542 position:50% align:center
It's parked at the metered
lot in Utagawacho, Shibuya.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.049 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
So, let me get this straight.

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:30.218 position:50% align:center
You're suggesting that Takei
was part of a cover-up

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:33.430 position:50% align:center
in the Sayuri Kambe murder
case 19 years ago?

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.223 position:50% align:center
And the recent
assassination of Imura

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:37.767 position:50% align:center
was also related to that case.

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.728 position:50% align:center
Why would he be involved?

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.229 position:50% align:center
If he didn't do what
he was told,

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:43.815 position:50% align:center
he would've been
taken out like she was.

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:45.400 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
Who's to blame?

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:46.860 position:50% align:center
Shigemaru Kambe.

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:51.781 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO laughs]

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:55.869 position:50% align:center
You think the mastermind
behind this is a ghost?

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:58.371 position:50% align:center
I don't blame you
for not believing me.

00:08:58.455 --> 00:08:59.706 position:50% align:center
Really.

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:01.374 position:50% align:center
But two of our men are dead,
and this is no time

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:02.876 position:50% align:center
to be playing around.

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:06.755 position:50% align:center
I don't have any hard
evidence that backs up

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:07.922 position:50% align:center
what I'm saying.

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:09.841 position:50% align:center
I just need you to
trust me on this one.

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:14.262 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] You had a serious
grudge against Takei, 

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:15.847 position:50% align:center
didn't you?

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.724 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:20.310 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] The day at the bank
when everything changed.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.228 position:50% align:center
You've held it against
him all this time.

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:31.321 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI]
Kato, where are you right now?

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
I went around behind the perp.

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:34.866 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI]
You have him in your sights?

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:36.201 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Yeah.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:39.037 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI] If you have a
clear shot... take it.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.288 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Okay.

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:50.131 position:50% align:center
[gunshot]

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:52.634 position:50% align:center
He's down.

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:53.760 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI]
Well done.

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:57.889 position:50% align:center
Step away!

00:09:57.972 --> 00:10:00.058 position:50% align:center
Hey. You're okay.

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:01.351 position:50% align:center
Stand back, Miss!

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:03.353 position:50% align:center
Move!

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:07.899 position:50% align:center
[gunshot]

00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:13.613 position:50% align:center
[BYSTANDERS yelling]

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:14.823 position:50% align:center

Who was shot?

[POLICEMAN B]
Everyone, please calm down!

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:17.033 position:50% align:center
It's all right!

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:18.243 position:50% align:center
[POLICEMAN A]
The hostages are safe!

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:19.494 position:50% align:center
Get them out of here.

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:22.247 position:50% align:center
[POLICEMAN C]
What's going on in there?

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:28.253 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
A toy?

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:33.091 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI]
Haru.

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:35.385 position:50% align:center
That woman was an accomplice.

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:37.137 position:50% align:center
It wasn't your fault.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.889 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure the higher-ups
understand that.

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:12.714 position:50% align:center
--It's nuts, right?
--[ARAKI] Yeah.

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:13.965 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
What the hell?

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:15.800 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI]
Grow up, Haru!

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:17.260 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Please leave me alone.

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:19.471 position:50% align:center
I'm sick of you only
looking out for yourself.

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:20.513 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI]
Come back.

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:22.057 position:50% align:center
I will never accept this!

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:27.979 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
Are you leaving?

00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:31.399 position:50% align:center
If you run, it was for nothing.

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
You will no longer be a hero.

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:35.820 position:50% align:center
Kato!

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.412 position:50% align:center
You resented Takei.

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:47.624 position:50% align:center
He put the responsibilities
of that day on your shoulders.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:49.668 position:50% align:center
--That's why--
--[KATO] There's no grudge.

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:53.672 position:50% align:center
I feel only appreciation
for Takei.

00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:55.590 position:50% align:center
The fact that I'm
somehow still a detective

00:11:55.674 --> 00:11:57.801 position:50% align:center
to this day is
all thanks to him.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.013 position:50% align:center
Make no mistake.

00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:03.848 position:50% align:center
I will solve this case.

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:06.017 position:50% align:center
The man who murdered
them will pay.

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:20.448 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE]
Please wait! This is a setup!

00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:30.667 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you.

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:38.299 position:50% align:center
[KAMEI]
I think I'm gonna die.

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:40.176 position:50% align:center
[YUMOTO]
Can it! Show some strength!

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.761 position:50% align:center
I've honed in on the signal!

00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:43.805 position:50% align:center
I should be picking
up audio soon.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:47.434 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:57.360 position:50% align:center
[M INVESTIGATOR C]
We're neutered.

00:12:57.444 --> 00:13:00.071 position:50% align:center
And with quite a mess
on our hands.

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:01.239 position:50% align:center
New orders.

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:02.782 position:50% align:center
The Prime Minister
says we can't touch

00:13:02.866 --> 00:13:04.951 position:50% align:center
the Kambe family.

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:06.494 position:50% align:center
We're just grunts.

00:13:06.578 --> 00:13:09.122 position:50% align:center
Doing whatever the
higher-ups command of us.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:10.206 position:50% align:center
[ARAKI]
Hey.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.001 position:50% align:center
Look.

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:16.296 position:50% align:center
Apparently, it was found
in Takei's desk.

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:27.307 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI]
Come back.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.017 position:50% align:center
I will never accept this!

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.061 position:50% align:center
[KATO] I feel only
appreciation for Takei.

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:33.646 position:50% align:center
The fact that I'm somehow
still a detective to this day

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.065 position:50% align:center
is all thanks to him.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:51.956 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE]
It's a nerve agent.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
They must be trying
to abduct you.

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:59.673 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] In that case, our man
is still somewhere nearby.

00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:02.092 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE] He met up with
someone else 25 minutes ago.

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:08.348 position:50% align:center
The name's Frantz Weinski.

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:10.725 position:50% align:center
He's the personal bodyguard
of Thomas Matheson,

00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:12.644 position:50% align:center
an international arms dealer.

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:13.937 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Stay on their trail.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.063 position:50% align:center
Got it.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.900 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE] All surveillance
camera data in the vicinity

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:20.151 position:50% align:center
is being deleted.

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.032 position:50% align:center
Not a problem.

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:27.325 position:50% align:center
We'll get our own.

00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:32.747 position:50% align:center
What does it sound like?

00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:34.207 position:50% align:center
Um, moaning?

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.750 position:50% align:center
Keep it in your pants.

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:39.713 position:50% align:center
This is work, not one
of your gross websites.

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:42.382 position:50% align:center
Maybe some kind of boat engine?

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:45.427 position:50% align:center
Oh! Right, you head over to
the boat races pretty often.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.596 position:50% align:center
Moron! I told you to separate
hobbies from our work.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.556 position:50% align:center
Quiet!

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:52.267 position:50% align:center
[noise continues]

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.978 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt.
Hot, hot moans.

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:57.439 position:50% align:center
Wrong, dude. Those are seagulls.

00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:58.648 position:50% align:center
I'm positive.

00:14:58.732 --> 00:15:00.358 position:50% align:center
I'd prefer that.

00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:03.194 position:50% align:center
If there are seagulls, then
they're close to the ocean.

00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:04.904 position:50% align:center
[noise continues]

00:15:04.988 --> 00:15:06.114 position:50% align:center
A whistle!

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:08.491 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a
seriously big boat.

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:11.703 position:50% align:center
[MAHORO] The signal reception
area is roughly ten kilometers.

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:13.413 position:50% align:center
There's only one
place in that radius

00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:15.290 position:50% align:center
where a large boat
could drop anchor.

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:18.543 position:50% align:center
Got that, Kato? Cool?

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.047 position:50% align:center
Yeah. We're on our way.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.888 position:50% align:center
[KAMEI] We should be there
in about 30 minutes.

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:31.681 position:50% align:center
Make sure you're careful
until we get--

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:32.932 position:50% align:center
[radio noise]

00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:36.436 position:50% align:center

[CROWD]
Spin Around!

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:24.109 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE] Master Daisuke,
I have a positive ID.

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:26.695 position:50% align:center
The perpetrator is
headed for Oura Wharf.

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.287 position:50% align:center
Where's Kato?

00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:39.582 position:50% align:center
He went ahead alone.
I did try to stop him.

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:41.292 position:50% align:center
Went ahead? To where?

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.306 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
This is not good.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.684 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] That's it?
Can't you make a decent report?

00:16:57.767 --> 00:17:00.145 position:50% align:center
Well, "not good" is the
only way I can phrase it.

00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:03.231 position:50% align:center
The ship is registered
to Panama.

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:05.400 position:50% align:center
Legally speaking,
it's a foreign country.

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:06.860 position:50% align:center
You'd need a passport to board--

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:08.403 position:50% align:center
[KATO] Don't give me trivia
in a situation like this!

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:10.196 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't it be better
if you just took photos

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.573 position:50% align:center
and came back?

00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:16.578 position:50% align:center
More bad news!
The ship is leaving the port!

00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:27.339 position:50% align:center
Kambe.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.136 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE] There's a location
on this ship I cannot scan.

00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50% align:center
I still believe there's a high
possibility of a trap.

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:38.391 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] Whether they're
expecting me or not,

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:40.435 position:50% align:center
I have to see this
man for myself.

00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:43.063 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE] I've sent you
an Active Support Veil.

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:49.152 position:50% align:center
So you're back.

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:50.695 position:50% align:center
Just what are you
planning to do?

00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center
Shigemaru Kambe
is aboard that ship.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.243 position:50% align:center
Along with Kato.

00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:59.454 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
Kato's here?

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:03.083 position:50% align:center
Two years back, he lost
the ability to fire his gun,

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:04.417 position:50% align:center
and became a different person.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:07.712 position:50% align:center
But since you showed up,

00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:10.048 position:50% align:center
it seems like he's longing
to become a hero again.

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:24.938 position:50% align:center
How do you plan on
boarding that ship?

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:26.106 position:50% align:center
A chopper?

00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:27.232 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE]
With a car.

00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:40.995 position:50% align:center
You're kidding.

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:53.091 position:50% align:center
[WEINSKI] The vessel that
approached us from underwater

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:54.884 position:50% align:center
has been destroyed.

00:18:54.968 --> 00:18:57.637 position:50% align:center
Proceed according to plan.

00:18:57.721 --> 00:18:59.723 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] How much of
this is according to plan?

00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:00.890 position:50% align:center
[M SECURITY A]
Huh?

00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:11.317 position:50% align:center
[DAISUKE] Where is
Shigemaru Kambe? Tell me!

00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:19.701 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
What does he think he's doing?

00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:28.752 position:50% align:center
Damn it.

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:47.854 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMARU] I've been
waiting for you, Daisuke.

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:49.397 position:50% align:center
It's true.

00:19:49.481 --> 00:19:50.690 position:50% align:center
You're alive.

00:19:56.905 --> 00:20:00.241 position:50% align:center
Use the adollium antenna
for electric interference.

00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:18.134 position:50% align:center
[SUZUE]
It can't be.

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:19.469 position:50% align:center
Please, no!

00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:26.601 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMARU]
Don't kill him.

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:28.478 position:50% align:center
No, wait!

00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:32.857 position:50% align:center
[WEINSKI]
Goodnight.

00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:43.993 position:50% align:center
Daisuke!

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:54.087 position:50% align:center
Ha. This payback should be fun.

00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:28.329 position:50% align:center
[WEINSKI chuckles]
