Have some, Takei.

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:23.189 position:50% align:center
Can't. I'm on standby right now.

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:25.316 position:50% align:center
Another time, Cho.

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:33.616 position:50% align:center
Well, uh, just one.

[NAKAMOTO]
When's the wife due?

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:39.622 position:50% align:center
Soon. The end of the month,
so it could be any day now.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:43.626 position:50% align:center
Remind me, she's Director
Saiki's daughter, right?

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.795 position:50% align:center
He's gonna end up
promoted for sure.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.465 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but that's not
the reason I married her.

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:49.799 position:50% align:center
Nothing wrong with

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.427 position:50% align:center

Check, please!

[WAITRESS 7A]
Okay!

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:07.275 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI]
Keep the change.

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:09.694 position:50% align:center
Got it. Be there in 15.

Kiyomizu!

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.910 position:50% align:center
You took your time.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.627 position:50% align:center
One stab wound
straight to the heart.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.796 position:50% align:center
The place looks
like it was ransacked.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.131 position:50% align:center
But I'd call this an execution.

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.676 position:50% align:center
Agreed, this wasn't a robbery.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.968 position:50% align:center
Who is she?

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:36.304 position:50% align:center
Sayuri Kambe.

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:10.899 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMIZU] Our victim
is Sayuri Kambe. Age, 34.

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:13.902 position:50% align:center
Wife to the heir of
the Kambe family business.

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.528 position:50% align:center
Robbery gone wrong?

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:17.906 position:50% align:center
Or was this some
sort of assassination?

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.866 position:50% align:center
The media will be
all over the case.

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.701 position:50% align:center
But don't worry about them.

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
We know what to do.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:24.954 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
Media aside,

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:28.083 position:50% align:center
we'll be closely watched
by the higher-ups, too.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:32.212 position:50% align:center
Our job is to achieve justice.
No matter who the victim is.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:35.340 position:50% align:center
So let's find the person who's
behind this and lock them away.

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:36.883 position:50% align:center
Do your best.

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:38.468 position:50% align:center
[INVESTIGATOR 7A] The victim's
husband is Shigemaru Kambe.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:42.764 position:50% align:center

this always give me a headache.

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:53.274 position:50% align:center
Should we start
with the interviews?

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:56.403 position:50% align:center
In a case like this,
you got to move quickly.

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:03.743 position:50% align:center
We're sorry for your loss.

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:06.871 position:50% align:center
We'd like to meet
with Shigemaru.

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:10.417 position:50% align:center
Since he's Sayuri's husband, it
could greatly aid investigation.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.918 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid you can't.

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:13.795 position:50% align:center
He's currently
overseas for work.

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:16.548 position:50% align:center
You mean he's not coming back
for his wife's funeral?

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:17.924 position:50% align:center
Correct.

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:20.301 position:50% align:center
We've obtained
the rental records.

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:23.555 position:50% align:center
Sayuri rented the
house two months ago.

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:26.016 position:50% align:center
Were they, perhaps, separated?

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:28.935 position:50% align:center
It would be helpful if you

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:31.396 position:50% align:center
provided us with
a photo of your son.

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:32.939 position:50% align:center
I have none.

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:35.066 position:50% align:center

This could take a while,
so please don't wait.

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:04.262 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI] It's strange no
matter how you look at it.

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:05.722 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
Hm?

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:07.182 position:50% align:center
I mean, what mother wouldn't

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:10.602 position:50% align:center
have a picture of her
oldest son? It's absurd.

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:12.354 position:50% align:center
Seems to me like
she was implying

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:14.522 position:50% align:center
that Shigemaru is our killer.

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:18.276 position:50% align:center
Well, I can't blame her for
looking out for her child.

[WITNESS 7A] Uh, I think his
eyebrows were a little higher.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.246 position:50% align:center
Uh... Actually, no.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.664 position:50% align:center
Maybe they were lower?

Of course I am!

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.338 position:50% align:center
The thing is,

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.757 position:50% align:center
I wasn't close and it was dark.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.217 position:50% align:center

I don't think the sketch
is gonna help your case.

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:47.681 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:51.643 position:50% align:center
Is the man you saw in
one of these photographs?

but you can't steal property.

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:06.207 position:50% align:center
Well... We can still
get into that locker.

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:21.139 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI] They decided they're
ending the investigation.

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:23.350 position:50% align:center
Should be soon.

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:24.684 position:50% align:center
There's not much
else for us to do

00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:28.021 position:50% align:center
now that the material
witness is dead.

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:30.106 position:50% align:center
It didn't even make the news.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:34.027 position:50% align:center
Probably due to pressure
from the Kambe family.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.237 position:50% align:center
What was the point in the end?

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:40.658 position:50% align:center
Plus, so you know,

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:42.911 position:50% align:center
Director Saiki is watching you.

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
Which mean Kiyomizu
is, too, by proxy.

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:49.167 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he told the
director about the key.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.294 position:50% align:center
Reporting information
up to your bosses

00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:53.630 position:50% align:center
is a matter of course for a cop.

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:56.091 position:50% align:center
I'm in no position to complain.

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:59.469 position:50% align:center
Still... I wanna know
who took the key.

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:00.845 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter.

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:03.473 position:50% align:center
There's nothing we
can do about it now.

00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:08.436 position:50% align:center
You should do the best you
can in the First Division.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:11.272 position:50% align:center
For your new baby.

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:12.440 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:21.282 position:50% align:center
Be a good father.
One your kid's proud of.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:31.751 position:50% align:center
I don't understand. It'd make
sense if it was just you.

00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:34.963 position:50% align:center
But why am I getting banished
to this basement unit?

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:35.839 position:50% align:center
[NAKAMOTO]
Sorry.

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:38.091 position:50% align:center

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:42.637 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMIZU] Tell me that's
not what I think it is.

00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:44.097 position:50% align:center
You know me.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.725 position:50% align:center
I never know when to give up.

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.982 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMIZU] And that's
the story of how Cho and I

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:58.028 position:50% align:center
got stuck in the wasteland
that is Modern Crimes.

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:11.291 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I haven't had
any leads the last few years.

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:12.584 position:50% align:center
However,

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
when our fancy new
recruit showed up...

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:20.175 position:50% align:center
Well, I thought things
would break wide open.

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:22.177 position:50% align:center
Sure enough, they did.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.928 position:50% align:center
Imura's assassination

00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:26.431 position:50% align:center
and the evidence
that was destroyed--

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:30.477 position:50% align:center
both can be linked to Kambe.

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:40.320 position:50% align:center
Where is Kambe?

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
Not here. No contact.

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:47.202 position:50% align:center
It's been three days
since Imura's death.

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:49.496 position:50% align:center
He hasn't shown up since then.

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:50.497 position:50% align:center
So what?

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.456 position:50% align:center
Do you suspect he did it?

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:52.499 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:56.252 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Haru.

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:58.880 position:50% align:center
I'd like a word
with him in private.

00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:05.136 position:50% align:center
I believe that Imura's murder
is connected to the old case.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.223 position:50% align:center
But I'm guessing you've
already surmised that.

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:12.894 position:50% align:center
I owe you, and after
19 years, I can repay you.

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:27.659 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI sighs] Did you know
that I used to work under him?

00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:30.412 position:50% align:center
I learned a lot
about the job that way.

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:32.288 position:50% align:center
However, because
of a certain case,

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:34.624 position:50% align:center
I stayed in the First
Investigation Division

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:36.543 position:50% align:center
while he was moved elsewhere.

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:39.212 position:50% align:center
[KATO]
Director Kiyomizu clued me in.

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:41.423 position:50% align:center
If I can arrest to perp
behind this murder,

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:45.927 position:50% align:center
maybe I can make up for
what happened back then.

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:51.016 position:50% align:center
Imura's case was a setup.

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:54.477 position:50% align:center
Someone hijacked her car
and forced the police chase.

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:56.312 position:50% align:center
High-tech stuff.

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:59.232 position:50% align:center
Same person is likely
behind the embassy case,

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:02.736 position:50% align:center
and the one person who
has those resources...

shown up at the station?

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:23.423 position:50% align:center
There's no need
for me to go there.

there something you're hiding?

exactly are you after?

You believe that everything
can be solved with money.

one who did her in. Heh.

00:17:35.847 --> 00:17:37.140 position:50% align:center
We need more evidence.

This is a start.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:40.769 position:50% align:center
He hacked into her car,
then arrested her.

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:43.229 position:50% align:center
Later, he killed her.
