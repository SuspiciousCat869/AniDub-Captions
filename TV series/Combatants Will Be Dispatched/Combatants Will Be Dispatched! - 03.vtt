[CHIEF OF STAFF] What? The Demon
Lord's army has fallen back?

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.307 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL 3A]
But they had the advantage!

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:19.436 position:50% align:center
Those demons are cunning--
are you sure it's not a trick?

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.355 position:50% align:center
According to our watchmen, the
invading army began to withdraw

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.190 position:50% align:center
shortly after nightfall.

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.026 position:50% align:center
That doesn't make
any sense to me.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.862 position:50% align:center
Their primary goal is
to capture our territory.

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:31.781 position:50% align:center
Why would they fall back without
accomplishing their objective?

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.283 position:50% align:center
--[door thuds]

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.951 position:50% align:center
If you'd like to
thank me personally,

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.453 position:50% align:center
now's a perfect time.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.496 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF OF STAFF] Hold your
tongue before the king, crumbum!

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.457 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Hmm? Who's this goober?

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.292 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF OF STAFF growls]
You don't know the face

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.336 position:50% align:center
of the army's chief of staff?!

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:45.337 position:50% align:center
Nah.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.880 position:50% align:center
Insubordinate cur...

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:50.133 position:50% align:center
Well. If you came here
to talk to Princess Tillis,

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.426 position:50% align:center
you'll have to wait.

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:52.969 position:50% align:center
Don't forget your position.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:56.639 position:50% align:center
You merely command women
and children with lowly blood.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.016 position:50% align:center
Well, guess what?

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:00.393 position:50% align:center
I just commanded those women
and children to destroy

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.520 position:50% align:center
the Demon Lord's
supplies, Gramps.

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:03.730 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:06.191 position:50% align:center
You would boast of such
a cowardly strategy?

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:08.485 position:50% align:center
I'd prefer to call it
a winning strategy.

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:11.321 position:50% align:center
They're dead meat
without food and water.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.365 position:50% align:center
They could still try to
muscle through and attack,

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:15.575 position:50% align:center
but that'd be pretty
freakin' risky.

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:19.329 position:50% align:center
The name's Agent Six.
AKA, the guy you owe big time.

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:20.622 position:50% align:center
Got it, peepaw?

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:21.873 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF OF STAFF growls]

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:24.834 position:50% align:center
'Cuz I'm the only one here
who's not a moron.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.503 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:32.258 position:50% align:center
Your unconventional approach
is what saved us, Agent Six.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:33.843 position:50% align:center
You've performed wonderfully.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.721 position:50% align:center
[KING]
Mm. And as the legends foretold.

00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:39.599 position:50% align:center
Now we simply wait for
the Chosen One to save us.

00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:40.934 position:50% align:center
Who what now?

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:43.144 position:50% align:center
Yes, the ancient legends
have told us there will be

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:44.646 position:50% align:center
a great darkness.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.691 position:50% align:center
And when the Demon Lord's
shadow looms over all mankind,

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:50.110 position:50% align:center
a crest will appear on
the hand of the chosen one

00:01:50.193 --> 00:01:52.195 position:50% align:center
as their power manifests.

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:53.780 position:50% align:center
They will cleave
through the darkness

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:57.242 position:50% align:center
and, after many trials,
defeat the Demon Lord.

00:01:57.325 --> 00:01:59.828 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Hmph. Well, it
looks like you've got

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:01.454 position:50% align:center
your Chosen One, right here.

Agent Six. Wow! Unbelievable.

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:09.129 position:50% align:center
Yep. I spotted this baby
when I first woke up today.

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:11.673 position:50% align:center
I guess this means
that I'm the Chosen One.

[TILLIS]
That's Spakoguvichula.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.759 position:50% align:center
Uh. Say what now?

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:17.137 position:50% align:center
I said, that's Spakoguvichula!

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.722 position:50% align:center
What a crazy-sounding word.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:22.183 position:50% align:center
It's the name of deadly insect
whose poison kills instantly!

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:24.477 position:50% align:center
Seriously?! Ahh! Ooh! Eeh!

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:26.980 position:50% align:center
Wait. How am I still alive?

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:30.275 position:50% align:center
Well. I guess the shot works.

[TILLIS]
A-Actually...

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:40.660 position:50% align:center
The crest has already appeared.

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:42.495 position:50% align:center
It's on my brother's hand,
and he's the prince of

Hey, Six.
How did your meeting go?

Eh. I got to yell
at an old man today.

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:34.024 position:50% align:center
I think I made their
"chief strategist" cry.

[ALICE]
Nice.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.610 position:50% align:center
So... what's going on
here with you two?

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:40.613 position:50% align:center
It's simple. She absorbs
genetic information

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:43.116 position:50% align:center
and takes on the attributes
of what she eats.

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.784 position:50% align:center
I want to try something.

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:47.078 position:50% align:center
She needs to consume
this grasshopper and see

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.372 position:50% align:center
if it makes her
virtually invincible.

I'll do almost anything!
But I can't eat bugs!

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:59.132 position:50% align:center

in place just like that.

Back home, making grasshopper
mutants was super taboo

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.148 position:50% align:center
in our organization.

Now, say "ahhh!"

And I'll tell you what.
If you eat all of it,

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:21.321 position:50% align:center
I'll give you something
really special, okay?

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:23.281 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
No way! Um. But...

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:26.451 position:50% align:center
What do you mean, by "special"?
Special 'cause it's yummy?

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:28.161 position:50% align:center
I'm willing to negotiate
if there's something good

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:29.579 position:50% align:center
to eat on the table.

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:31.039 position:50% align:center
It's called silicone.

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:33.750 position:50% align:center
I'm curious to see if eating it
will enlarge your chest.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.251 position:50% align:center
--[ROSE growls]
--[SIX] An interesting theory!

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.253 position:50% align:center
Maybe it'll give
her huge boobie traps!

I don't need that, okay?!

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.383 position:50% align:center
It's not the kind of
power-up I'm looking for!

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:44.427 position:50% align:center
So get that stuff outta my face,
or I'll Crimson Breath ya!

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.639 position:50% align:center
[SIX] You're like a little
ball of dynamite, Rose.

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:49.849 position:50% align:center
So why do let the army
push you around?

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:53.645 position:50% align:center
Seems like you could get
something else that pays more.

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:56.481 position:50% align:center
I want to find out
who I really am.

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:58.983 position:50% align:center
I was discovered
inside of an old ruin.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.613 position:50% align:center
I was asleep and surrounded
by artifacts, supposedly.

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:05.407 position:50% align:center
"Supposedly"?

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.868 position:50% align:center
That's what they told me,
but I don't remember it.

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:11.079 position:50% align:center
I've got some memories of
the old man that made me,

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:13.206 position:50% align:center
but that's really all.

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.959 position:50% align:center
He was always researching
a particular stone.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:18.712 position:50% align:center
One that he called the
"stone of miracles."

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:20.672 position:50% align:center
He told me it could do anything!

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
But one day, he tried performing
some kind of forbidden magic

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
and it killed him.

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:29.639 position:50% align:center
So I'm committed to
honoring his dying wish,

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:32.058 position:50% align:center
and making his life's
dream come true!

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:34.644 position:50% align:center
But I don't know anything
about his research,

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:38.481 position:50% align:center
or barely even
anything about myself.

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:40.692 position:50% align:center
They promised me that
if I worked for them,

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:42.777 position:50% align:center
they'd share the research
they've got on the ruins

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.654 position:50% align:center
where I was found.

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:47.991 position:50% align:center
Man, this country.
Shitheads galore.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.493 position:50% align:center
Listen, we should
have Rose work for us.

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:53.204 position:50% align:center
I bet she could already pass
for one of our mutants.

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:55.540 position:50% align:center
All we have to do is get her
in the right mindset

00:06:55.623 --> 00:06:58.710 position:50% align:center
and she would make
an excellent combat agent.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:01.379 position:50% align:center
Hey, Rose. So whaddaya think
about officially becoming

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:02.839 position:50% align:center
one of us, huh?

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:04.549 position:50% align:center
Uh, wait, are you trying
to tell me that I'm not already

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:06.801 position:50% align:center
part of the unit, or what?

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:08.678 position:50% align:center
Since you're still
practically a child,

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:11.681 position:50% align:center
you'll need the proper
ideological education.

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.933 position:50% align:center
From now on, it'd be beneficial
if you were to think of me

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:15.060 position:50% align:center
as your mother.

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:16.561 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna know
what you'd teach me.

00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:18.063 position:50% align:center
Plus, I'm older than you!

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.940 position:50% align:center
Wh-Why are you putting
this badge on me?

00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:23.443 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Because now,
you're an apprentice agent!

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:26.154 position:50% align:center
And an apprentice agent
has to do what I say!

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:27.697 position:50% align:center
Hey. Wait a sec.

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:30.158 position:50% align:center
What are you guys planning,
and why are you being so weird?

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:31.534 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Way to go!

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:33.370 position:50% align:center
[ROSE] Uh. What are you guys
doing with your hands?

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.288 position:50% align:center
I've got a bad feeling
about this, Commander.

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:38.041 position:50% align:center
And I'm not gonna eat the
grasshopper or the silly cone!

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:39.376 position:50% align:center
Ah. I hear it.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.961 position:50% align:center
Everyone's clapping 'cause
they're happy for me.

00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:44.172 position:50% align:center
I am finally getting
married, you guys!

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:45.965 position:50% align:center
I'm not a big loser anymore.

[snores]

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:53.223 position:50% align:center
It's strange.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.600 position:50% align:center
What is? Are you talking
about the situation

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.352 position:50% align:center
with the Demon Lord's army?

00:07:57.435 --> 00:08:00.689 position:50% align:center
[SIX] No. It's something
a whole lot bigger than that.

00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:03.608 position:50% align:center
You know, Alice. We've been
in this alien civilization

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:05.193 position:50% align:center
for a while, now, yeah?

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:06.778 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Hmm?

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.822 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
What I don't understand...

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:12.617 position:50% align:center
...is why in the hell isn't
anybody falling in love with me?

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:13.827 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.745 position:50% align:center
I'm, like, the hero
of this entire country!

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:17.997 position:50% align:center
And my unit is packed
to the gills with women!

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:20.125 position:50% align:center
Plus, I've had run ins with
high caliber mega-babes

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:21.418 position:50% align:center
like Tillis and Heine--

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.420 position:50% align:center
I mean, even that
police chick was kinda hot.

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:24.963 position:50% align:center
It's just crazy!

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:27.424 position:50% align:center
All of that's in play, but not
a single fanservice event?!

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:29.050 position:50% align:center
I haven't run into
a shorty in the hallway

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:31.052 position:50% align:center
and "accidentally" pet
her sweater kittens?

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:32.887 position:50% align:center
I haven't bumped into
a hottie around a corner

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:35.306 position:50% align:center
and gotten a peek at
her undercarriage?

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.059 position:50% align:center
I literally spend hours every
day crouching at the corner.

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:40.061 position:50% align:center
And absolutely
nothing has happened!

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:41.521 position:50% align:center
Yeah. They told
me to tell you

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:43.898 position:50% align:center
to stop doing that, by the way.

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:45.191 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.154 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
U-Uh...

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:52.532 position:50% align:center
[ALICE, monotone]
Oh, yeah. Ah...

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:55.577 position:50% align:center
[SIX whimpering]

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.537 position:50% align:center
So now you've gotten
to feel up a pretty girl.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.081 position:50% align:center
You're a lump of
silicone and also a baby!

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:02.292 position:50% align:center
Of course a robot
wouldn't understand!

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.627 position:50% align:center
I want some real human
attraction and chemistry!

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center
Like, with an actually
sexy human girl!

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.048 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
What's going on?!

00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:10.467 position:50% align:center
Why're you screaming
about sexy girls?

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.345 position:50% align:center
We're having an emergency
mission briefing, now.

00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:16.264 position:50% align:center
Six, your presence
has been requested!

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:21.311 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL 3A] I appreciate
you all coming here today.

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I've bad news
about the Chosen One's party.

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:27.734 position:50% align:center
They bravely fought two
demons atop Duster tower.

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:30.820 position:50% align:center
The clever Rista of Knowledge
and the mighty Gil of Power.

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:32.781 position:50% align:center
--But were beaten off.
--[gasping]

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:35.158 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL 3A] There is some good
news to be found in all this--

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:38.411 position:50% align:center
the Chosen One's
wounds were not fatal.

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.706 position:50% align:center
However, it is imperative
that we act quickly.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.084 position:50% align:center
Thanks to Agent Six's
unorthodox strategy,

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:45.669 position:50% align:center
the enemy did pull out,

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:48.922 position:50% align:center
but we're well aware
that they will be back.

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:52.092 position:50% align:center
To be completely candid,
they're much stronger than us.

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:55.720 position:50% align:center
If this war drags on, they'll
wipe us off the map before

00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:59.099 position:50% align:center
the Chosen One can
defeat the Demon Lord.

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:01.142 position:50% align:center
Now, according to
The Chosen One,

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:02.727 position:50% align:center
that Tower holds a treasure.

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:04.521 position:50% align:center
Something that will
be absolutely crucial

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:07.399 position:50% align:center
in our ultimate goal of
defeating the Demon Lord.

00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:09.651 position:50% align:center
But we can't rest on our
laurels and simply wait

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:12.195 position:50% align:center
for him to recover.
We must move forward.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.030 position:50% align:center
Lay siege to Duster Tower

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
and claim the
treasure for ourselves.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.410 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:20.453 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF OF STAFF]
Hold on, General!

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:23.164 position:50% align:center
So, do you have a strategy
to ensure that we'll collect

00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50% align:center
the treasure inside
without the Chosen One's help?

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
How can we avoid his failure?

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:31.214 position:50% align:center
Well, as you can see.

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:33.299 position:50% align:center
The tower is a hollow structure,

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:37.137 position:50% align:center
with a lone spiral staircase
twisting along its walls.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.346 position:50% align:center
So then...

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.140 position:50% align:center
We'll have to funnel
our main battalion into

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50% align:center
a single file line,
going up the staircase.

00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
That's unless, of course,
you've a better strategy!

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:47.480 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF OF STAFF growls]

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:51.151 position:50% align:center
Hmm. I know! Perhaps
Agent Six has a plan in mind!

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:54.070 position:50% align:center
He is the architect of
our current advantage.

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:55.655 position:50% align:center
No doubt he has
some brilliant plan,

00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:58.783 position:50% align:center
as he was so quick to belittle
us for our missteps.

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.660 position:50% align:center
--[chuckles]
--[ATTENDEES gasping]

00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:03.580 position:50% align:center
What do you advise
we do, Agent Six?

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.165 position:50% align:center
Set the thing on fire.

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:08.251 position:50% align:center
Are you being serious?
The tower's made of stone.

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:09.711 position:50% align:center
We can't just burn it down.

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:12.672 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Listen. This tower is
a big hollow thing, right?

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:13.965 position:50% align:center
So we just take
the first floor,

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:16.384 position:50% align:center
and then we set
a massive bonfire!

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:19.095 position:50% align:center
We'll roast 'em like
the weenies they are!

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:20.138 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:23.350 position:50% align:center
I mean... It sounds effective.

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:24.809 position:50% align:center
What do you all think?

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:26.186 position:50% align:center
I, uh...

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:28.772 position:50% align:center
Can a knight of the crown
behave in such a way?

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:30.482 position:50% align:center
[SNOW whimpers]

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:34.235 position:50% align:center
No. That's it.

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:36.279 position:50% align:center
Although I can see
the plan's merits,

00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:38.615 position:50% align:center
it goes against our values.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:42.285 position:50% align:center
Therefore, we'll attack Duster
Tower in force tomorrow morning!

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:47.582 position:50% align:center
--[FIGHTERS yelling]
--[metal clanging]

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.086 position:50% align:center
Ignore the racket, y'all.

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:52.504 position:50% align:center
We're just gonna
sit here and chill

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:53.838 position:50% align:center
until it starts getting dark.

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:54.964 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:56.216 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with you?!

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:58.843 position:50% align:center
Are you suggesting we
sit this one out?

00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:00.970 position:50% align:center
The Chosen One missed his
chance to defeat the demons

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:02.430 position:50% align:center
at the top of that thing.

00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50% align:center
Rista of Knowledge and
Gil of Power are still up there!

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:06.976 position:50% align:center
So if we can beat them,

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.938 position:50% align:center
imagine the glory and riches
we'll reap from our win!

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:11.272 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Tell me something.

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:13.233 position:50% align:center
The Chosen One's
pretty tough, yeah?

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Yes, extremely!

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:16.653 position:50% align:center
Strong enough to
take on the Elite Four!

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:17.904 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
And the guys that whupped him.

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50% align:center
You wanna climb
all those stairs to fight 'em?

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.575 position:50% align:center
Eff that noise. Hard pass.

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:24.786 position:50% align:center
If they're still up there by
the time evening rolls around

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:27.747 position:50% align:center
and Grimm's nap is over, we'll
figure out some kinda plan.

00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:29.624 position:50% align:center
You'd just sit here while they--

00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center
[snarls]

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:32.002 position:50% align:center
I thought that
at least in battle,

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:34.337 position:50% align:center
you could be counted
on just a little bit.

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.881 position:50% align:center
But you're a coward!
I'll go there myself!

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:40.844 position:50% align:center
And don't you even think about
stealing my glory, you hear me?!

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:42.887 position:50% align:center
Hey, uh. Snow's leaving?

00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:44.889 position:50% align:center
Is she gonna be okay
all by herself?

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:46.349 position:50% align:center
I'm sure she'll be just fine.

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:47.851 position:50% align:center
She knows her way
around a fight.

[slurps]

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:52.397 position:50% align:center

awake yet, or not?

How can you behave that
way with the commander?

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:23.595 position:50% align:center
Be careful telling a dirty
brute of a man like that

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:26.556 position:50% align:center
you'll do anything he wants.
But let me stay and watch you--

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.308 position:50% align:center
Grimm, if you don't stop this
and wake up right now,

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:30.727 position:50% align:center
you will never wake up again!

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:34.439 position:50% align:center
Whoa! I was having the most
wonderful, prophetic dream.

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:37.901 position:50% align:center
Ya know. Eternal slumber
might be the solution.

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:40.320 position:50% align:center

we just got her up.

It gonna work?

Yes. It'll work.

scheme do you have in mind?

straight to the top, baby.

About halfway, I think.

I will, sir!

to come along.

better than the Elite Four,

stronger than them.

Practically the perfect strategy
for a Kisaragi Employee,

and with the added touch of
saying it so the enemy can hear,

00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:22.227 position:50% align:center
you're effectively shutting
down their only means

some care. Like, now.

It's a good bit of gold.

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:35.652 position:50% align:center
Exactly how much is
this worth in this country?

00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:37.404 position:50% align:center
[SNOW sighs] Your brain
damage make you forget

00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
the value of gold? I'd say a
family could live the high life

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.826 position:50% align:center
for at least a year
off of that bag alone.

00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:44.077 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.121 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] Mm. You don't think
it's enough, huh?

00:20:46.204 --> 00:20:47.622 position:50% align:center
I hear ya.

00:20:47.706 --> 00:20:50.458 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty particular when it
comes to my money as well.

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:52.919 position:50% align:center
Alice. I think I'm
outta the spy game.

00:20:53.003 --> 00:20:54.754 position:50% align:center
I'm going full native
and dying rich here.

00:20:54.838 --> 00:20:56.006 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
What's that?

00:20:56.089 --> 00:20:57.257 position:50% align:center
--[ALICE] Blah, blah, blah...
--[SNOW] Oh no.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.550 position:50% align:center
They're talking
about me, aren't they?

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:00.969 position:50% align:center
[ALICE growls]
Now, don't be hasty!

00:21:01.052 --> 00:21:03.513 position:50% align:center
You said that in our language,
so I know you're serious.

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center
Listen! I spent an entire
month sweating my ass off

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:07.726 position:50% align:center
fighting in the damn
Sahara Desert,

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:09.394 position:50% align:center
and when I got back,
not only did I not get

00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:12.147 position:50% align:center
a word of thanks, they sent me
on meaningless errands instead.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.648 position:50% align:center
And my take-home
pay would barely cover

00:21:13.732 --> 00:21:15.275 position:50% align:center
a few weeks' rent and food.

00:21:15.358 --> 00:21:16.860 position:50% align:center
To be completely honest,
I've always been

00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:19.612 position:50% align:center
a little bit confused
why you didn't quit sooner.

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:21.156 position:50% align:center
That's enough, you two.

00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:23.366 position:50% align:center
You know I can't understand
a single word you say!

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.909 position:50% align:center
Not to worry.

00:21:24.993 --> 00:21:27.912 position:50% align:center
When Six gets worked up, he just
slips into his old language.

00:21:27.996 --> 00:21:30.290 position:50% align:center
Apparently, he didn't
expect this much money.

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:34.002 position:50% align:center
Oh. Okay. I get it now.

00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:35.879 position:50% align:center
And this is for you.

00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:39.132 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Yeah? Wow. Thank you...

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:41.092 position:50% align:center
I haven't gotten a present
since I was gifted

00:21:41.176 --> 00:21:42.594 position:50% align:center
my beautiful shotgun.

00:21:42.677 --> 00:21:46.181 position:50% align:center
That wasn't really
a present, but sure.

00:21:46.264 --> 00:21:48.433 position:50% align:center
[ALICE giggles]

00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:51.019 position:50% align:center
[sniffs, sighs]

00:21:51.102 --> 00:21:53.521 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Mm. Well, she's happy.

00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:55.023 position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:23:26.031 --> 00:23:27.657 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Mm...

00:23:27.741 --> 00:23:29.492 position:50% align:center
So, these alien government
people paid Six

00:23:29.576 --> 00:23:32.495 position:50% align:center
upwards of several million
for his first job?!

00:23:32.579 --> 00:23:34.748 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] Well. I, for one,
think it's good that

00:23:34.831 --> 00:23:36.916 position:50% align:center
he's getting some
clout over there.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.128 position:50% align:center
That must mean his spy
mission is going well.

00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:42.088 position:50% align:center
Does anybody have
a ballpark idea of what

00:23:42.172 --> 00:23:44.257 position:50% align:center
we've been paying him?

00:23:44.341 --> 00:23:45.508 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Mm...

00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:48.011 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL] This concludes
the report of Agent Six,

00:23:48.094 --> 00:23:50.930 position:50% align:center
AKA the man who was paid
truckloads worth of gold

00:23:51.014 --> 00:23:52.599 position:50% align:center
by people I barely know.

00:23:52.682 --> 00:23:56.186 position:50% align:center
P.S. I'm also asking
for a pay raise.

00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:59.356 position:50% align:center
Okay, we should send him some
good meat or something.
