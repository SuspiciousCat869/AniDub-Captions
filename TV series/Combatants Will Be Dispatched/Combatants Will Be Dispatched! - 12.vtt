of our trusty Destroyer.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:49.084 position:50% align:center
The enemy had a more

[ALICE]
Yeah.

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
You went deep into negative

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:06.226 position:50% align:center
It was the only way
it would work.

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:08.269 position:50% align:center
The repairs are going
to take awhile,

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center

it's still useable.

[ALICE] Uh. In case
you were wondering,

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:31.292 position:50% align:center
Snow and Rose ended up
capturing Russell.

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:33.586 position:50% align:center
I threatened the nearby
Toris army platoon with

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.338 position:50% align:center
the Destroyer and they fled.

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:37.590 position:50% align:center
I'm glad that's
all taken care of.

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:39.217 position:50% align:center
And I think I know
exactly how to handle

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.428 position:50% align:center
that mouthy little fish kid.

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:45.056 position:50% align:center
So. What about the rest
of the Demon Lord's army?

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.642 position:50% align:center
Tiger Man was able to take
them all out by himself,

00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:49.144 position:50% align:center
just like I thought.

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:52.772 position:50% align:center
And we reclaimed quite a bit
of land from them and Toris.

00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:54.399 position:50% align:center
Which means we've
completed the mission

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:56.401 position:50% align:center
that Astaroth gave us, too.

00:12:56.484 --> 00:12:58.987 position:50% align:center
Now, all that's left
is peace talks with Toris.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.114 position:50% align:center
We should leave that
up to the princess, though.

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.116 position:50% align:center

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:06.077 position:50% align:center

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:24.054 position:50% align:center

Uh. Bodily waste, huh?

00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:35.273 position:50% align:center
So, how long have I
been out of commission?

00:13:35.357 --> 00:13:36.816 position:50% align:center
This is day three.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.777 position:50% align:center

is long enough to have to

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.862 position:50% align:center
piss and shit multiple times.

me that, I'm begging you!

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:51.122 position:50% align:center

Uh. I guess so.

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:03.551 position:50% align:center

same kind of interest in me.

00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:06.137 position:50% align:center

and Rose is too scary,

00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:08.890 position:50% align:center
and Snow is completely
out of the question.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:11.309 position:50% align:center
I can settle for you, I suppose.

00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:12.727 position:50% align:center

Hmm.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.314 position:50% align:center

just said, out loud,

You're so lucky that
I'm an android, you know.

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:43.174 position:50% align:center
But if you want a fight,
then bring it on.

00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:44.801 position:50% align:center
Simmer down, Alice.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:47.137 position:50% align:center
We still have
messes to clean up.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.388 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Hmm?

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:51.349 position:50% align:center
What say you and I
go for a little walk?

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:56.646 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Yo, lookin' good, kiddo.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.732 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe that
you're still alive and kicking

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:02.152 position:50% align:center
after everything I did to you.
Guess you're pretty tough.

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:03.528 position:50% align:center
That's just one of the
things that makes me

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:05.321 position:50% align:center
a living legend, bro.

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:07.657 position:50% align:center
Hah! Anyway,
I've got a little offer--

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:08.908 position:50% align:center
Not interested!

00:15:08.992 --> 00:15:10.910 position:50% align:center
"The Legend" is still
talking, short stack!

00:15:10.994 --> 00:15:12.954 position:50% align:center
So stop being such
a brat and listen up.

00:15:13.038 --> 00:15:15.707 position:50% align:center
It's actually a pretty
good deal for you, too.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.584 position:50% align:center
You know how this kingdom
desperately needs water,

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:19.586 position:50% align:center
don't you? So I was thinking--

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:21.338 position:50% align:center
[RUSSELL growls]
Shut up, man!

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.131 position:50% align:center
Did you not hear me say
that I wasn't interested

00:15:23.214 --> 00:15:24.716 position:50% align:center
in your dumb offer?

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:26.718 position:50% align:center
Although I may
still be "just a kid,"

00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:28.928 position:50% align:center
I'm a leader in
the Demon Lord's army.

00:15:29.012 --> 00:15:31.014 position:50% align:center
So I'm not going to betray
them to the first person

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:32.891 position:50% align:center
that makes me an offer.

00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:35.560 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah? It'd be way better if
you'd get with the program

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:38.063 position:50% align:center
while we're still playing
nice, you feel me?

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:39.856 position:50% align:center
'Cuz I guarantee
you'll wish you did.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:43.151 position:50% align:center
Do your worst. Combat chimeras
aren't particularly affected

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:45.653 position:50% align:center
by the heat, the cold,
or even pain.

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:48.114 position:50% align:center
I can resist almost any torture.

00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:51.159 position:50% align:center
Or is the legendary bad guy
Agent Six too much of a coward

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:53.661 position:50% align:center
to try and hurt an itty-bitty
kid like me?

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:57.832 position:50% align:center
[SIX sighs]
Have it your way. I'm done.

00:15:57.916 --> 00:15:59.584 position:50% align:center
I gave it my best shot,
Tiger Man,

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:01.544 position:50% align:center
but the brat's
just too stubborn.

00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:02.796 position:50% align:center
[TIGER]
I see.

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:05.298 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll have to get
my paws on him, meow.

00:16:05.382 --> 00:16:06.883 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:10.887 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize that torture
was your specialty, Tiger Man.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.472 position:50% align:center
[TIGER]
Hmm...

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:14.182 position:50% align:center
[RUSSELL]
Who's the freak?

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:16.184 position:50% align:center
If you're humans,
why do you have a disgusting,

00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:19.312 position:50% align:center
hairy beast man on your team?

00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:21.106 position:50% align:center
--[TIGER] Guh-rowl...
--[RUSSELL chcukles]

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:24.442 position:50% align:center
Hey, beast man. Can you
understand human language?

00:16:24.526 --> 00:16:26.486 position:50% align:center
You able to talk?

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:28.279 position:50% align:center
[TIGER]
Purrfect, Six...

00:16:28.363 --> 00:16:30.573 position:50% align:center
I'll buy you a saucer
of beer later, meow.

00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:33.660 position:50% align:center
[SIX giggles]
I appreciate it, Tiger Man.

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:37.038 position:50% align:center
You're not just creepy,
you're super cool and creepy!

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:40.583 position:50% align:center
You really screwed up
by not taking Six's offer,

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:41.793 position:50% align:center
because then all you
would've had to do

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:44.129 position:50% align:center
is make water every day.

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:46.047 position:50% align:center
--[RUSSELL] Huh?
--[TIGER] Meow!

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:47.257 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.384 position:50% align:center
I am known as Tiger Man!

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:51.219 position:50% align:center
So good to meet you!

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:53.513 position:50% align:center
I'm a mutant that just loves
the kiddos so much,

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:55.432 position:50% align:center
that when I retire, they're
actually gonna make me

00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:57.392 position:50% align:center
into a purrty little girl, meow!

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:58.810 position:50% align:center
[slurps]

00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:00.353 position:50% align:center
[RUSSELL]
Huh...?

00:17:00.437 --> 00:17:01.855 position:50% align:center
[TIGER]
I hope you're ready!

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:05.400 position:50% align:center
I have a strong feline you and I
are gonna get furry close.

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:06.651 position:50% align:center
But don't you worry.

00:17:06.735 --> 00:17:09.738 position:50% align:center
I can be as gentle
as a kitten, meow!

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:12.574 position:50% align:center
[RUSSELL chuckles nervously]
Too bad for you,

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:14.075 position:50% align:center
because I'm a boy!

00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:17.037 position:50% align:center
I guess an animal like you
wouldn't be able to tell, huh?

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.663 position:50% align:center
[TIGER]
Oh, I could tell.

00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:22.167 position:50% align:center
And no lion,
I prefer it that way, meow!

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.418 position:50% align:center
Huh...?

00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:25.712 position:50% align:center
You have such a cute,
delicate face.

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:28.757 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'll be fetching
in a skirt, meow!

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.176 position:50% align:center
Hey, what is this thing
saying to me?

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:33.636 position:50% align:center
It's a bluff, right?
To scare me?!

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.139 position:50% align:center
I don't care if you're
a boy or a girl.

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:38.725 position:50% align:center
I'm like an ol' saloon door,
which means I can swing

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:40.810 position:50% align:center
whichever way I need to, meow!

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:42.270 position:50% align:center
Attaboy Tiger Man!

00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:46.399 position:50% align:center
Way to take Bad Cop-Bad Cop
to the next level! Ow-ow!

00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:48.818 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Fine, I get it,
you guys beat me, okay?!

00:17:48.902 --> 00:17:51.029 position:50% align:center
I'll make water or do
whatever else you want!

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:53.156 position:50% align:center
Oh! You are the man, Tiger Man!

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:54.866 position:50% align:center
Now the kid is
sayin' he'll help us!

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:57.327 position:50% align:center
[TIGER]
Not so fast!

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:00.705 position:50% align:center
You can't toy with me like this
and then just change your mind,

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:02.916 position:50% align:center
--you feel meow?
--[RUSSELL whimpers]

00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:04.751 position:50% align:center
Please! I surrender now!

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:07.337 position:50% align:center
Have mercy!
This is way too weird for me!

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, okay?!
Please forgive me?!

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:12.884 position:50% align:center
[TIGER]
Hmm... Oh, fine.

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:14.761 position:50% align:center
Don't throw a hissy fit.

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:18.723 position:50% align:center
All I'll make you do today
is wear a cute li'l skirt, meow!

00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:20.517 position:50% align:center
But in exchange...

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.229 position:50% align:center
Purromise that you're gonna make
an ocelot of water for Kisaragi.

00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center
Myeah.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.565 position:50% align:center
You made a huge
mistake today, water boy.

00:18:27.649 --> 00:18:29.818 position:50% align:center
Though we're on different
sides, if you consider yourself

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:31.736 position:50% align:center
a bad guy, remember this:

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.863 position:50% align:center
You either resist right up
to the bitter end,

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:36.241 position:50% align:center
or you switch sides at
the first opportunity.

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:38.576 position:50% align:center
[RUSSELL whimpers]

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:41.579 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM]
This is totally unacceptable!

00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:43.832 position:50% align:center
I gave Alice a light,
but effective curse

00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:45.375 position:50% align:center
down in the ruins,
then the next thing I knew,

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:47.210 position:50% align:center
I was waking up on the altar!

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.546 position:50% align:center
I never got a scene,
or my own great moment!

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:51.506 position:50% align:center
Whaddaya mean?
You had a moment!

00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:52.716 position:50% align:center
You did your
whole backfire thing

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:54.676 position:50% align:center
and then everybody
laughed at you.

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:58.555 position:50% align:center
No way! I refuse to be your
comic relief, do you hear me?!

00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
Ever since I joined this unit,
it's been one bad thing

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:02.100 position:50% align:center
after another.

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:04.894 position:50% align:center
Rejection in Toris,
starvation in the desert...

00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:07.439 position:50% align:center
And not a single group date
has worked out for me!

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:09.983 position:50% align:center
Your dating fails are
not my fault, okay?!

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:12.819 position:50% align:center
But I understand.
You're not happy.

00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:14.571 position:50% align:center
So I'll put in the request
to have you moved

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:16.823 position:50% align:center
to another unit, ASAP.

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:18.033 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM]
No!

00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:20.285 position:50% align:center
Please don't!
I'm begging, Commander!

00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:22.245 position:50% align:center
You can't just abandon me
after we've been through

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:23.788 position:50% align:center
so much together!

00:19:23.872 --> 00:19:25.498 position:50% align:center
I thought you were different,
but you're throwing me away

00:19:25.582 --> 00:19:27.834 position:50% align:center
like the others!
You! Big! Jerk!

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:29.336 position:50% align:center
You're the one
who brought it up!

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:31.796 position:50% align:center
What in the hell am I supposed
to do to make you happy?!

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.548 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM] You're supposed
to be nice to me!

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:36.051 position:50% align:center
After all, we went on
a midnight date around town

00:19:36.134 --> 00:19:37.635 position:50% align:center
and you've seen my panties!

00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:39.179 position:50% align:center
[ROSE] Something's up with
this expensive fish.

00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:40.847 position:50% align:center
I think it's starting to make me
feel kinda tingly all over.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.558 position:50% align:center
Well, more accurately,
the fish is an electric eel.

00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:44.934 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
What a pain in the ass.

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:46.311 position:50% align:center
If you can't be useful,
at least put on some shoes,

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:47.395 position:50% align:center
'cuz you can walk!

00:19:47.479 --> 00:19:48.897 position:50% align:center
Commander,
I explained that already!

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:53.109 position:50% align:center
I can't wear them because of
a cruel and powerful curse!

00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:54.652 position:50% align:center
Um. What's wrong?

00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:56.821 position:50% align:center
I don't like you
just freezing up like that.

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:58.281 position:50% align:center
Yeah, looking back
on everything,

00:19:58.365 --> 00:20:00.367 position:50% align:center
it was probably a mistake
on my part to believe you'd

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.203 position:50% align:center
actually blow up if you
put some freakin' shoes on.

00:20:03.286 --> 00:20:04.579 position:50% align:center
Say what now?

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:06.414 position:50% align:center
You heard me. And if you
put forth the effort to walk

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:08.500 position:50% align:center
on your own two feet,
we wouldn't have to drag you

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:11.086 position:50% align:center
around everywhere
like a whiny sack of potatoes!

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:13.963 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM] Commander, are you
being serious right now?!

00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:16.132 position:50% align:center
That really hurts my feelings!

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:18.426 position:50% align:center
Hey, Alice!
Have 'em send down some socks!

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.679 position:50% align:center
I wanna see what happens
when she puts them on!

00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:22.847 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that'll be
a perfect experiment.

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:24.432 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM]
Hmm...?

00:20:24.516 --> 00:20:27.727 position:50% align:center
No, no, no! Commander,
please don't do this to me!

00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:29.813 position:50% align:center
I'll do anything else
you want me to, I swear!

00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:32.691 position:50% align:center
Oh! Heh, heh. Well,
what I want you to do

00:20:32.774 --> 00:20:36.236 position:50% align:center
is slide those tootsies
in there. Nice and cozy.

00:20:36.319 --> 00:20:37.237 position:50% align:center
Hah...

Geh!

00:20:38.321 --> 00:20:39.739 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:42.534 position:50% align:center
[shrieks] You murdered me,
you dead-eyed little gremlin!

00:20:42.617 --> 00:20:45.328 position:50% align:center
O great Lord Zenarith,
this is not what it looks like!

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:47.330 position:50% align:center
--They forced this on me!
--Hah?!

00:20:47.414 --> 00:20:49.874 position:50% align:center
You're starting to feel a little
bit warm there, Grimm.

00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:52.210 position:50% align:center
Hold the phone,
are you actually glowing?

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:53.420 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Self-destruct?

00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:55.463 position:50% align:center
You're going to
self-destruct, aren't you?!

00:20:55.547 --> 00:20:57.966 position:50% align:center
Why in the hell are you
so happy about this?!

00:20:58.049 --> 00:20:59.259 position:50% align:center
Clear out, everyone!

00:20:59.342 --> 00:21:00.719 position:50% align:center
Get back!

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:03.430 position:50% align:center
Get back!

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:08.560 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
Grimm!

00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:09.936 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Get some water, everybody!

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.479 position:50% align:center
Let's put out the fire!

00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:14.315 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Wow, I suppose I was
wrong about you all this time!

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:16.109 position:50% align:center
Excellent
self-destruction skill!

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
Ten out of ten!

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.653 position:50% align:center
[SIX] This is not
a great time for this.

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:21.239 position:50% align:center
Grab some dirty socks or
whatever for an offering.

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:24.075 position:50% align:center
Seriously? I'm up here working
hard on a peace deal

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:28.079 position:50% align:center
with Toris, and they're
all goofing off?

00:21:28.163 --> 00:21:30.457 position:50% align:center
Wise father and dear brother...

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.168 position:50% align:center
Please, watch over me
from up above.

00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:43.470 position:50% align:center
Meow...

00:21:43.553 --> 00:21:45.930 position:50% align:center

--[TIGER] Hmm?

Russell...

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:53.146 position:50% align:center
Gadalkand... Faustless...

00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:55.857 position:50% align:center
I swear on my life
I'll take vengeance.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:00.070 position:50% align:center
[sobs]

00:22:00.153 --> 00:22:01.780 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
"That's my report.

00:22:01.863 --> 00:22:04.282 position:50% align:center
Even though the mission was
a success, the situation

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:06.368 position:50% align:center
is not quite under control.

00:22:06.451 --> 00:22:09.829 position:50% align:center
So, I'm requesting that you
send additional combat agents."

00:22:09.913 --> 00:22:11.373 position:50% align:center
[CHOSEN ONE]
Faustless of the Wind!

00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:13.416 position:50% align:center
We may now be in
some strange world,

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.502 position:50% align:center
but I will still stop you!

00:22:15.585 --> 00:22:17.629 position:50% align:center
[FAUSTLESS] You will never
defeat me, Chosen One!

00:22:17.712 --> 00:22:20.090 position:50% align:center
And the Demon Lord's
army is unstoppable!

--[CHOSEN ONE, FAUSTLESS grunt]

00:22:21.466 --> 00:22:25.303 position:50% align:center
Hey, Agents F-18 and F-19!
Stop fooling around!

00:22:25.387 --> 00:22:28.098 position:50% align:center
I have had enough of your
stupid, "chosen one" game!

00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:29.641 position:50% align:center
--[thudding]
--[grunting]

00:22:29.724 --> 00:22:34.813 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH sighs] I wonder if I
should go help them, myself.

00:22:40.777 --> 00:22:42.696 position:50% align:center
[SIX groans]
It's finally over.

00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:44.030 position:50% align:center
Combatants have been dispatched,

00:22:44.114 --> 00:22:46.991 position:50% align:center
so now it's time to
rest and relax-tched.

00:22:47.075 --> 00:22:48.410 position:50% align:center
Shut up, Six.

00:22:48.493 --> 00:22:50.537 position:50% align:center
And I would advise
not slacking off too much

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.539 position:50% align:center
before you earn back
all those evil points.

00:22:52.622 --> 00:22:54.249 position:50% align:center
Thanks for bringing me down.

00:22:54.332 --> 00:22:56.793 position:50% align:center
But I have to do that
before I can go home.

00:22:56.876 --> 00:22:58.837 position:50% align:center
What's up,
you feeling homesick?

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.424 position:50% align:center
You know that one of those
stars above us is the sun.

00:23:02.507 --> 00:23:05.301 position:50% align:center
Squint hard enough and
you might even see Earth.

00:23:06.386 --> 00:23:08.680 position:50% align:center
So there're as many places
they'll send us to invade

00:23:08.763 --> 00:23:11.099 position:50% align:center
as there are stars in the sky.

00:23:11.182 --> 00:23:13.768 position:50% align:center
Do you think I'll ever be able
to enjoy a life of loose women,

00:23:13.852 --> 00:23:15.812 position:50% align:center
fatty food, and ice-cold beer?

00:23:15.895 --> 00:23:18.440 position:50% align:center
It's possible. Once we've
conquered every one

00:23:18.523 --> 00:23:21.192 position:50% align:center
of those stars, I bet
they'll let you retire.

00:23:21.276 --> 00:23:23.653 position:50% align:center
Man, that's gonna
take freakin' forever!

00:23:23.737 --> 00:23:26.239 position:50% align:center
Hey, ya know, if going
home's not an option,

00:23:26.322 --> 00:23:29.617 position:50% align:center
maybe I should just rule
over this planet instead!

00:23:29.701 --> 00:23:31.619 position:50% align:center
Build myself a hottie harem!

00:23:31.703 --> 00:23:33.204 position:50% align:center
I am the worst!

00:23:33.288 --> 00:23:35.498 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:23:35.582 --> 00:23:37.042 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Hmm.
