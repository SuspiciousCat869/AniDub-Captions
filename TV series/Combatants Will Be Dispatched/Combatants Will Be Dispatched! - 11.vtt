00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.641 position:50% align:center
[TIGER]
I'm feline kinda left out again.

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:19.811 position:50% align:center
I wanna go have fun and explore
the old ruins too, meow.

00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:22.397 position:50% align:center
This isn't some
little sightseeing trip.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.192 position:50% align:center
Toris and the Demon Lord's army
have begun their joint invasion.

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.778 position:50% align:center
We'll need to split
our forces to counter.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.905 position:50% align:center
They're entering
Grace's territory.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.657 position:50% align:center
Here and here.

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:34.993 position:50% align:center
The Royal Guard combatants
will be dispatched to handle

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:36.995 position:50% align:center
the soldiers from Toris.

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:40.373 position:50% align:center
And you'll be going here to
stave off the Demon Lord's army.

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:42.083 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Seriously?

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.085 position:50% align:center
I know he's a huge,
ferocious, mutant and all,

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:47.172 position:50% align:center
but he can't hold off a big ol'
bunch of demons by himself.

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:49.883 position:50% align:center
[TIGER] She's sending me 'cause
she thinks lolicons are clawful

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.426 position:50% align:center
and should go extinct, meow.

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:53.803 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Yes, I 100% believe that.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.305 position:50% align:center
[TIGER sobs]

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:58.016 position:50% align:center
But I wouldn't send someone
who couldn't handle the job.

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:00.143 position:50% align:center
--Now look closely at the map.
--[SIX, TIGER] Mm?

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.563 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] You're the Mutant Tiger,
King of the jungle, aren't you?

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:06.107 position:50% align:center
Me-wow. Ambush spots everywhere.

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:07.817 position:50% align:center
I could beat these rats
with my eyes closed

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.652 position:50% align:center
and my tail tied
in a knot, meow.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.613 position:50% align:center
That's the spirit, Tiger Man!

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:14.240 position:50% align:center
The meows and stuff are still
creepy, but you're a badass.

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:16.159 position:50% align:center
Mao. Oh, stop it.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.912 position:50% align:center
While the knights and Tiger Man
are occupying the enemy,

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:21.873 position:50% align:center
our unit will make
our way back to Toris.

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:23.917 position:50% align:center
We get our hands on
that ancient weapon

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.294 position:50% align:center
and we can threaten
our foes into submission.

00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:27.337 position:50% align:center
[TIGER]
Clap clap clap.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.047 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
This one's for the bad guys.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.342 position:50% align:center
So let's go in there and steal
as much glory as we can.

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.135 position:50% align:center
[TIGER, SIX]
Yeah!

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.397 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
Just so I understand,

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:10.982 position:50% align:center
Toris declared war
on our kingdom,

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.650 position:50% align:center
and we're headed
there right now?

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.611 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Yes, this is the perfect time.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:17.113 position:50% align:center
Because at the moment,
our only opponents in the ruins

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.573 position:50% align:center
will be the Demon
Lord's leaders,

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:20.116 position:50% align:center
who should already be there.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.243 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
Hmm. Hey, Boss,

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:26.164 position:50% align:center
why did you pull that prank on
the prince, anyway?

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:28.166 position:50% align:center
You may be in charge,
but sometimes I gotta wonder

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:29.751 position:50% align:center
if you're not that smart.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:32.462 position:50% align:center
And you may look all sweet and
stuff, but sometimes I wonder

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:35.173 position:50% align:center
if you're just a
total psychopath.

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:37.342 position:50% align:center
In case you've forgotten,
you tried to eat me!

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:39.010 position:50% align:center
Would you please
stop saying that?

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:40.637 position:50% align:center
I know that I have
a healthy appetite,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
but I would never actually
try to eat you, Boss.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:46.101 position:50% align:center
Huh?! As much as we'd all like
to forget about the whole thing,

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:48.103 position:50% align:center
you were gonna gobble
me up the other night!

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:51.189 position:50% align:center
--Uh?
--[SNOW whines]

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:53.650 position:50% align:center
I still gotta pay
that stupid loan...

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.026 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Hey, Six.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.945 position:50% align:center
You need to figure out a way
to shut that crybaby up

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:59.155 position:50% align:center
before I lose my patience.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.990 position:50% align:center
--[SIX] Uh...
--I really don't know!

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.118 position:50% align:center
What'd I do to make you
say that about me?

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:05.078 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go bankrupt!

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:08.707 position:50% align:center
I need to make some money,
like, right now! Wah!

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna have
to sell my bathwater...!

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.919 position:50% align:center
Jeez. Boo-hoo,
Tillis cut your pay,

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.629 position:50% align:center
but you've just
gotta get over it!

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:16.172 position:50% align:center
Just look at me.

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.675 position:50% align:center
I burn through my check like
corporate does the rain forest.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:21.344 position:50% align:center
But I don't cry about it,
I still have fun!

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.722 position:50% align:center
'Coz there's so much more
to life than money.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50% align:center
You "still have fun" because
I'm the one who's in charge

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:27.475 position:50% align:center
of your allowance.

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:29.019 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.104 position:50% align:center
You've really been getting your
allowance from a little kid?

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:32.814 position:50% align:center
That's, like,
terminally embarrassing.

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:34.315 position:50% align:center
I'm over here trying
to make you feel better

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.067 position:50% align:center
and you just wanna roast me?

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:38.862 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Okay, fine.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:39.946 position:50% align:center
Listen, Snow.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.489 position:50% align:center
If you don't screw up
this mission,

00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:43.283 position:50% align:center
I'll give you an allowance, too.

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:44.617 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.369 position:50% align:center
And if we can successfully
get that ancient weapon

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.663 position:50% align:center
out of the ruins, I'll throw
in a bonus to the tune

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:50.373 position:50% align:center
of three months' paychecks.

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:52.375 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Alice, my queen!

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.297 position:50% align:center
Now, like I was saying,
the Demon Lord's top brass

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.965 position:50% align:center
will likely already be there.

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:00.759 position:50% align:center
So don't charge in
like a wild animal.

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:02.635 position:50% align:center
No, of course not, my queen!

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:06.306 position:50% align:center
Your loyal lady Snow would never
even dream of letting you down!

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:07.807 position:50% align:center
[SIX] I wonder what kind
of terrible things you did

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:10.769 position:50% align:center
in your past lives to end up
being you in this one.

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:12.479 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] Shut up!
You act like you're better,

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.356 position:50% align:center
but Queen Alice
is paying your way.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.192 position:50% align:center
My world runs on money,
and that's all I'm after.

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:19.152 position:50% align:center
For the right payout,
I'd shank my colleagues,

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:21.946 position:50% align:center
rat out my friends, and meet
my parents just so I could

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.656 position:50% align:center
screw them over, as well.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
Not to discourage
you from talking like

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:27.243 position:50% align:center
an unredeemable
piece of crap,

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:30.080 position:50% align:center
but you've gotta stop
calling me "Queen." I hate it.

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.248 position:50% align:center
[gasps, chuckles]

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:35.335 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Hey. Ya think we should
hire her at Kisaragi?

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:38.254 position:50% align:center
She may have what it takes
to be a real bad guy.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.756 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
She's not evil, though.

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.258 position:50% align:center
She's more of a bottom-feeding
scumbag, like you.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:43.635 position:50% align:center
--[SIX] Oh?!
--Heh.

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:45.679 position:50% align:center
I could probably buy myself
another glacial sword

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.514 position:50% align:center
with that kind of bonus.

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:49.099 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
She'll get greedy, screw up,

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.059 position:50% align:center
and drag everyone down with her.

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:52.060 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Fair.

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:54.312 position:50% align:center
Th-That's not me, though!

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:56.815 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM yawns]

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.400 position:50% align:center
Nice li'l nappy-poo!

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.902 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Shut up, Sleeping Booty!

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:02.696 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Looks like there's
some truth to the stories

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.656 position:50% align:center
of an ancient civilization.

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.825 position:50% align:center
I'm beginning to
think whatever's in there

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:08.410 position:50% align:center
could be worth our time.

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:11.496 position:50% align:center
Maybe. But the thing's
just gonna go nuts

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:14.165 position:50% align:center
and attack us or
blow up or something.

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:15.500 position:50% align:center
I know how this works.

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:18.420 position:50% align:center
I've seen it happen in, like,
a zillion animes.

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:21.214 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Yeah. And we can assume
it'll self-destruct as well.

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:23.591 position:50% align:center
Anyway, if they're still making
camp here, we're not too late

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:26.136 position:50% align:center
to get our hands on this
mysterious weapon.

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:29.264 position:50% align:center
Ugh. I'm so tired.

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:31.558 position:50% align:center
Feels like we've killed every
weird little enemy in there,

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.184 position:50% align:center
but they keep on coming.

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:35.395 position:50% align:center
And then there were all
the traps we found.

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:37.689 position:50% align:center
But we've almost got
our hands on the prize.

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:39.983 position:50% align:center
We'll probably
reach it tomorrow.

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:43.236 position:50% align:center
That's true, so try and
get some rest, Russell.

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.238 position:50% align:center
I bet you used a bunch
of your magic, huh?

00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:47.407 position:50% align:center
I don't need any rest--
I'm just fine!

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
Plus, combat chimeras like me
have infinite magic power.

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:52.412 position:50% align:center
As long as I don't
run out of food,

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:54.831 position:50% align:center
I can use water magic
all day and night!

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:57.167 position:50% align:center
Okay. Then go
and stuff your face,

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.960 position:50% align:center
because we've got
a lot to do tomorrow.

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:01.546 position:50% align:center
[RUSSELL] I will, and I'd
appreciate it if you'd stop

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:03.381 position:50% align:center
treating me like a kid!

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:06.217 position:50% align:center
[HEINE chuckles]

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:08.553 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] They seem pretty worn
out from their trip inside.

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:11.306 position:50% align:center
Yeah. So what do we do now?

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:12.640 position:50% align:center
Hey, Boss?

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:15.226 position:50% align:center
If we're going into the ruins,
can we do it soon?

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.811 position:50% align:center
I'd really like to
wrap things up here

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:18.730 position:50% align:center
before the night is over.

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:21.066 position:50% align:center
I mean, you wouldn't want
to miss out on your opportunity

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.901 position:50% align:center
to take advantage of
my awesome powers,

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:24.235 position:50% align:center
now would you?

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:26.112 position:50% align:center
I can't remember your weird
powers being "awesome"

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:28.239 position:50% align:center
or even that useful,
to be honest.

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:29.699 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM]
What?!

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.910 position:50% align:center
Is this gonna be your big
chance to prove me "thong"?

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:35.330 position:50% align:center
Hey! Watch your tongue!
I am Grimm the Archpriest!

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:37.707 position:50% align:center
And I'm a valued member
of this unit!

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:40.710 position:50% align:center
[SNOW giggles]
Don't you worry about it, Grimm!

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:43.713 position:50% align:center
Even in their wildest dreams,
the enemy would never imagine

00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:47.050 position:50% align:center
we'd brazenly return to Toris
at the beginning of the war!

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.635 position:50% align:center
That's right, Snow!

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.595 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I guess...

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:54.099 position:50% align:center
Listen. This is something that
might seem a little cowardly.

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:55.308 position:50% align:center
Just a little.

00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:56.976 position:50% align:center
It would appear that
our adversary has let

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.520 position:50% align:center
their guard down.

00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:00.897 position:50% align:center
Let's forget the ruins,
sneak into their camp under

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.482 position:50% align:center
the cover of night and...

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:03.483 position:50% align:center
Khhh!

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:05.318 position:50% align:center
Sneak in there and--
[grunts]

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.362 position:50% align:center
Stop! Cut that out!

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:08.738 position:50% align:center
Really, Snow?

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:10.699 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to be
a brave knight, aren't you?

00:08:10.782 --> 00:08:12.617 position:50% align:center
Yeah. She's right!

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:14.786 position:50% align:center
I think the commander's
rubbing off on you.

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:16.830 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm doing my best here.

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:19.332 position:50% align:center
We're up against two
of their top leaders, yeah?

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:21.376 position:50% align:center
[ROSE growls]

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:22.961 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Six, Alice...

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:26.131 position:50% align:center
You guys have to understand how
perfect this plan is, don't you?

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:28.508 position:50% align:center
Just what kind of person
do you take me for?

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:30.677 position:50% align:center
A Kisaragi Combat Agent
would never do something

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.178 position:50% align:center
--so stupid and lame.
--[ALICE] Mm-hmm.

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:34.055 position:50% align:center
--[SNOW gasps]
--[ALICE] Attaboy, Six.

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:37.183 position:50% align:center
That's exactly what I'd expect
from a Kisaragi Combat Agent.

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:40.687 position:50% align:center
Hold on! I'm actually
trying to be just like you!

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.106 position:50% align:center
So this is her
trying to be like us?

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:44.566 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing that
someone must not have

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:46.776 position:50% align:center
a very high opinion of Kisaragi.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.737 position:50% align:center
Seems not. What a shame.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.114 position:50% align:center
But at least someone
set her straight.

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:53.241 position:50% align:center
We're gonna be
resting here for the night.

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:54.576 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:57.037 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Then tomorrow,
we follow them in.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.330 position:50% align:center
We let them go ahead of us
and fight all the monsters

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:01.207 position:50% align:center
and trigger all the traps.

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:04.210 position:50% align:center
They'll totally wear themselves
out trying to reach the goal,

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:07.756 position:50% align:center
and once they're relaxed
and happy, we merc 'em.

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:12.093 position:50% align:center
[GROUP whimpering]

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:15.013 position:50% align:center
Heh! They're giving us
a golden opportunity.

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:16.765 position:50% align:center
Do you really think that
I'd wanna waste it on

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:19.100 position:50% align:center
some lameass night attack?!

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:23.438 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Well said! Spoken like
a true Kisaragi agent. Bravo!

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:24.773 position:50% align:center
[BOTH groan]

[snoring]

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:45.710 position:50% align:center
[SIX] And all of a sudden
we go from fantasy

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:48.254 position:50% align:center
to some freaky science fiction.

00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:50.590 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] There's something odd
about this planet's history

00:09:50.674 --> 00:09:53.343 position:50% align:center
and civilization. I think
what we've witnessed so far

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:56.388 position:50% align:center
is some kind of
post-collapse society.

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:57.639 position:50% align:center
Just look at her.

00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:00.266 position:50% align:center
A creature like that
didn't happen naturally.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:01.267 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
Mm.

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:02.310 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Something wrong?

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:04.646 position:50% align:center
It's nothing, really.
Just that...

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:07.315 position:50% align:center
Even though I know for a fact
that this isn't the same ruin

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:11.319 position:50% align:center
that I was found in,
it still feels familiar to me.

00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:14.948 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Fascinating, but let's
focus on tailing them for now.

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:17.450 position:50% align:center
What are you trying to do
with that thingy, Snow?

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:19.035 position:50% align:center
It's some kinda ancient relic.

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:21.913 position:50% align:center
Which means it's gotta be worth
a nice bag of gold at least.

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.498 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:26.626 position:50% align:center
A big part of me is feeling like
we should just leave her behind.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.837 position:50% align:center
Guess my offer of a bonus
for a job well done

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.755 position:50% align:center
wasn't enough for her.

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
Yeah, these are deff-o
robot carcasses, right?

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:40.223 position:50% align:center
Looks to me like they
were old and falling apart,

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:43.852 position:50% align:center
but, yes, they're robots.
Probably for security.

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:45.228 position:50% align:center
--[SNOW] Six, wait!
--Huh?

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:46.813 position:50% align:center
I think my guy would pay
out the nose for this stuff.

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Cut it out, okay?!

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:50.358 position:50% align:center
We still need to
catch up to Heine's unit.

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:52.777 position:50% align:center
We can come back
for this if there's time.

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:54.779 position:50% align:center
Alice, will you talk
some sense into her?

00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:56.031 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Interesting...

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:58.033 position:50% align:center
These guys are clearly
powered by a kind of--

00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:59.617 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Not you, too!

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:03.204 position:50% align:center
They're familiar--I feel like
I used to play with them

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:04.372 position:50% align:center
back when I was younger.

00:11:04.456 --> 00:11:05.498 position:50% align:center
--[boom]
--Ah?

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.042 position:50% align:center
[RUSSELL]
Heine, there's more of them!

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:09.085 position:50% align:center
A new type of guardian!

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:14.341 position:50% align:center
[HEINE] They just won't stop,
huh? I'll handle them!

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:17.260 position:50% align:center
My flames will turn them
into piles of ash!

00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:21.222 position:50% align:center
[HEINE yells]

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:28.438 position:50% align:center
[SIX chuckles]

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:32.525 position:50% align:center
After this and the camping,
I'm ready to take a nap

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:34.486 position:50% align:center
in a real bed again.

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:36.321 position:50% align:center
[RUSSELL] Well, since
I'm a combat chimera,

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:39.324 position:50% align:center
the rugged lifestyle
works perfectly for me.

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:41.201 position:50% align:center
You like the modern
comforts, huh?

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:43.787 position:50% align:center
I guess I just don't need as
much pampering and convenience

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.246 position:50% align:center
as you do.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.998 position:50% align:center
[HEINE] You don't have to be
a brat about it, ya know?

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:47.999 position:50% align:center
[RUSSELL chuckles]

00:11:48.083 --> 00:11:50.085 position:50% align:center
Seems like they're
friends to me.

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:53.046 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Let's move.

00:11:58.677 --> 00:11:59.886 position:50% align:center
[SIX grunts]

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:03.139 position:50% align:center
[HEINE]
Yet another trap.

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:06.393 position:50% align:center
Are you okay, Russell?
You hurt?

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:09.062 position:50% align:center
No, I'm perfectly fine,
thanks to you, Heine.

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:10.897 position:50% align:center
It looks like it got you
a little bit, though.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.525 position:50% align:center
Hang on just a second
and I can heal you.

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:16.653 position:50% align:center
You know that you
don't need to protect

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:19.656 position:50% align:center
a combat chimera like me.
We're tough.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.535 position:50% align:center
I just don't want anything
to happen to you is all.

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:26.413 position:50% align:center
We're working together as
a team to beat the Sand King,

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:28.748 position:50% align:center
but we need you the most.

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:30.709 position:50% align:center
Because only you can do it.

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.585 position:50% align:center
Heine...

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:35.714 position:50% align:center
I can't die yet. At least not
until we're done with all this

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:38.049 position:50% align:center
and have finished
off the Sand King.

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:40.218 position:50% align:center
Well, you can't die after
we're done here either,

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:41.511 position:50% align:center
you understand?

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:44.055 position:50% align:center
You may be mature,
but you're still just a kid.

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:46.766 position:50% align:center
And grown ups are
supposed to look out for kids.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.853 position:50% align:center
[RUSSELL] Hmm. I still
don't want you to treat me

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:51.855 position:50% align:center
like one, though.
And just you watch,

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:53.398 position:50% align:center
there's gonna be a time
when you're in trouble

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:55.900 position:50% align:center
and you'll need me to
look out for you instead.

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:58.570 position:50% align:center
[HEINE laughs]
I can't wait for that.

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:01.573 position:50% align:center
[RUSSELL growls] Hey,
it's not a joke, I'm serious!

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:04.951 position:50% align:center
Look at those two morons,
they have no idea

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:06.661 position:50% align:center
that we're even here.

00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:09.664 position:50% align:center

Yeah, whaddaya need now?

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:14.294 position:50% align:center
I can't see the sun,
but my body is telling me

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:17.630 position:50% align:center
that it's still out, and I need
to be somewhere sleeping.

00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:20.050 position:50% align:center
Neat. So you think you could
throw one of your little curses

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.926 position:50% align:center
their way, or what?

00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:26.014 position:50% align:center
If they were to lose their
magic powers all of a sudden...

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:28.558 position:50% align:center
...they'd be up a certain
creek without a paddle.

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.810 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's not a bad idea.

00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:33.188 position:50% align:center
But I'm gonna need to call it
out in kind of a loud voice

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:35.774 position:50% align:center
for the curse to
have its full effect.

00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
I don't know, Boss.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.694 position:50% align:center
I'm actually starting to
feel really bad for them!

00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:42.781 position:50% align:center
They're putting everything
they've got into their mission.

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:44.491 position:50% align:center
Don't start getting soft on me!

00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:47.327 position:50% align:center
Your entire stupid country is
depending on us with this thing.

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.662 position:50% align:center
So wussing out is not
an option, you feel me?

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:51.998 position:50% align:center
Uh... It's just that...

00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:53.083 position:50% align:center
Bonus...

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:55.627 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Uh...

00:13:55.710 --> 00:14:00.131 position:50% align:center
Well, I am still a knight.
I vowed to serve the kingdom.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.718 position:50% align:center

00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:06.680 position:50% align:center

so full you can barely walk.

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:08.515 position:50% align:center

Do you honestly believe

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.767 position:50% align:center
I'll do anything you ask
as long as you promise

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.102 position:50% align:center
there's a meal involved?

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:14.979 position:50% align:center
I'll do it this time,
but don't get cocky!

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:20.151 position:50% align:center
Well, if you ask me, it may
be too late for both of them.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.329 position:50% align:center
This is it, Heine.
We're finally here.

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:42.048 position:50% align:center
So that's the weapon that
can defeat the Sand King.

00:14:42.132 --> 00:14:44.384 position:50% align:center
Makes sense that
it would be so big.

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:48.471 position:50% align:center
