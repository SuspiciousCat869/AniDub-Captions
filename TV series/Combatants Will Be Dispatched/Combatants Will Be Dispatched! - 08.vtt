[TILLIS groans]
No luck.

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:43.126 position:50% align:center
I suppose I may need to recite
it in front of a full audience.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.670 position:50% align:center
I know what this is.

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:47.130 position:50% align:center

[TILLIS gasps]
No, that is not it!

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:51.718 position:50% align:center
This is all because you decided
to make our prayer profane!

[SIX]
Hmm? I did what, now?

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:57.015 position:50% align:center
That just doesn't sound like
something I would do at all.

00:00:57.099 --> 00:01:00.143 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS] Is he lying?
Or did he just forget?

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:02.980 position:50% align:center
So what's the skinny?
Must be big to bring me

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.022 position:50% align:center
all the way here.

00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:06.358 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Mm...

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:09.236 position:50% align:center
I do have a rather urgent
request for you.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.905 position:50% align:center
I believe it's something
only a man like you can do.

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:14.825 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Tillis.
Trust me, I'm flattered,

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.869 position:50% align:center
but you're a little shifty
for my taste.

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:18.453 position:50% align:center
Stop being nasty!

00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:21.373 position:50% align:center
I'm saying I have a crucial
mission for you, Agent Six!

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:24.251 position:50% align:center
And I am the
furthest from shifty!

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:26.044 position:50% align:center
This matter concerns
this artifact,

00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:28.714 position:50% align:center
a major source of water
for the kingdom.

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:30.132 position:50% align:center
Ever since it stopped working,

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.968 position:50% align:center
our nation hasn't had
nearly enough water.

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:35.888 position:50% align:center
So we imported Water Stones,
which we've been able to get

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:39.600 position:50% align:center
from Toris, a kingdom
that shares our border.

00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:41.310 position:50% align:center
Now that the artifact
has been fixed,

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:44.855 position:50% align:center
we shouldn't be forced to
rely on trade any longer.

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.815 position:50% align:center
But then when it
came time to use it,

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.026 position:50% align:center
father refused to say
the indecent prayer,

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.695 position:50% align:center
and has since vanished
without a trace.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.240 position:50% align:center
Well, why don't
you say it, then?

00:01:55.324 --> 00:01:57.659 position:50% align:center
So, while we search
high and low for Father,

00:01:57.743 --> 00:02:01.246 position:50% align:center
I'll be having Snow deliver a
message to the kingdom of Toris.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.416 position:50% align:center
Agent Six, I'd like for
you to escort her there.

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:05.751 position:50% align:center
I think we could
avoid all of this

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:07.085 position:50% align:center
if you just said it for him.

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:09.129 position:50% align:center
We reduced imports once
and now we're asking

00:02:09.213 --> 00:02:12.549 position:50% align:center
to raise them again.
Negotiations will be quite hard.

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:13.759 position:50% align:center
Know what's easy?

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:15.344 position:50% align:center
You getting up there
and saying it yourself.

00:02:15.427 --> 00:02:16.929 position:50% align:center
Also!

00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:20.098 position:50% align:center
Toris's crown prince is known
for being quite the womanizer.

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:22.643 position:50% align:center
Which is why we're sending Snow,
who despite her personality,

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:24.144 position:50% align:center
is still quite pretty.

00:02:24.228 --> 00:02:27.314 position:50% align:center
Stop! You're freaking me out,
which is kinda hard to do!

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:29.942 position:50% align:center
If you let me finish,
you'll understand.

00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:33.237 position:50% align:center
In case something bad happens,
I want you to protect Snow,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.323 position:50% align:center
and hopefully catch
the prince in the act as well.

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:39.910 position:50% align:center
If Prince Grabby Hands tries
to seduce a royal messenger,

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:43.539 position:50% align:center
well, that kind of incident
may ease up negotiations.

00:02:43.622 --> 00:02:47.084 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Where I'm from, we call
that strategy "blackmail."

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.961 position:50% align:center
And, if you accept this mission,

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:52.548 position:50% align:center
I'll gladly give you all the
information Alice is requesting.

00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:54.299 position:50% align:center
Info?

00:02:54.383 --> 00:02:58.387 position:50% align:center
Yes. Information on the various
ruins throughout the continent.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.308 position:50% align:center
In fact, there appears to be
an unexplored ruin inside Toris.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.285 position:50% align:center

be one with the ground.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.121 position:50% align:center
You'd better sit.

00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:50.749 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] Hey, Six. You ever want
to sell this magic device,

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:53.961 position:50% align:center
I know a guy that'll pay well
for a rare item like this.

Look at the deadly heggs!

It's a pleasure.

I've never actually seen

make that happen for me?

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.812 position:50% align:center
Yes. But of course.

00:05:53.896 --> 00:05:57.065 position:50% align:center
I'll prepare a few as gifts,
no problem at all, ma'am.

them with Princess Tillis.

Oh, she'll get some.

Ladies and gentlemen.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.052 position:50% align:center
Crown Prince Engel has arrived.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:31.053 position:50% align:center
[ENGEL groaning]

[SNOW]
Prince Engel! Nice to meet you!

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.850 position:50% align:center
My name is Snow,
and I've come all the way

00:08:36.934 --> 00:08:38.560 position:50% align:center
from the Kingdom of Grace!

00:08:38.644 --> 00:08:40.938 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Hold up, she doesn't
care what he looks like?

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:44.107 position:50% align:center
Oh my. They've sent quite
a fetching emissary our way.

00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:47.110 position:50% align:center
I'm sure the men usually travel
great distances to see you.

00:08:47.194 --> 00:08:49.363 position:50% align:center
Your Highness, you're going
to make me blush.

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:51.156 position:50% align:center
What a pleasant surprise,
they didn't tell me

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.326 position:50% align:center
you were so manly.
Or so handsome and svelte.

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:57.120 position:50% align:center
I have to admit,
I'm getting a little dizzy.

00:08:57.204 --> 00:09:00.332 position:50% align:center
Wow. She actually has
zero shame, doesn't she?

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:01.834 position:50% align:center
None at all.

00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:04.253 position:50% align:center
Seems she is
a confirmed money-sexual.

00:09:04.336 --> 00:09:07.172 position:50% align:center
She'd fall in love with a slime
or an orc for a good payout.

00:09:07.256 --> 00:09:08.924 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Ah! Be still my heart.

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:10.843 position:50% align:center
Miss Snow, we do have
mirrors in this kingdom,

00:09:10.926 --> 00:09:12.803 position:50% align:center
so you don't have to go out
of your way to flatter me

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:13.929 position:50% align:center
like this, you know.

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:16.640 position:50% align:center
But I honestly
find you attractive!

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:19.309 position:50% align:center
Please, look into my eyes,
Your Majesty!

00:09:19.393 --> 00:09:23.063 position:50% align:center
My vision is perfect, and is
this not the look of honesty?

00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:25.399 position:50% align:center
I... I can't gaze into
those beautiful eyes

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:27.067 position:50% align:center
and call you a liar, can I?

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.403 position:50% align:center
Come on, man,
have a little self-respect.

00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:31.572 position:50% align:center
Maybe... he's just blind?

00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:35.325 position:50% align:center
Thank you. Perhaps there are
some girls like you out there.

00:09:35.409 --> 00:09:36.869 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Mm-hmm!

00:09:36.952 --> 00:09:40.163 position:50% align:center
[ENGEL] So... Let's talk about
the reason why you're here.

00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:41.707 position:50% align:center
You've come to
discuss the situation

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.333 position:50% align:center
concerning the Water Stones.

00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:46.753 position:50% align:center
Ahh! I'm trying my hardest
to seduce you right now,

00:09:46.837 --> 00:09:49.214 position:50% align:center
and you just wanna talk
about boring state business?!

00:09:49.298 --> 00:09:52.801 position:50% align:center
Uh, well, just what do you
expect me to do instead?

00:09:52.885 --> 00:09:55.554 position:50% align:center
Because if I were to fraternize
with an ally's messenger,

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:57.097 position:50% align:center
it'd be an international
incident!

00:09:57.181 --> 00:09:58.599 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Wow, what a coward!

00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:01.018 position:50% align:center
Everybody says that you're
a handsy, skirt-chasing letch.

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:02.227 position:50% align:center
Were they wrong about that?

00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:04.438 position:50% align:center
[ENGEL] Insulting me is
not going to help you.

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:05.647 position:50% align:center
Besides, I thought you liked me!

00:10:05.731 --> 00:10:07.858 position:50% align:center
There's no hope, we're boned.

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:10.319 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM]
You dare take me for a fool?!

00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:13.447 position:50% align:center
If you do have a fiancée,
you shouldn't hide that from me!

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.616 position:50% align:center
Just because you're kind of hot,
it doesn't give you permission

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:17.409 position:50% align:center
to play games with
a maiden's heart!

00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:19.161 position:50% align:center
Miss Grimm, please calm down.

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:20.579 position:50% align:center
Silence, fool!

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:23.749 position:50% align:center
O Great Lord Zenarith.
Bring woe upon this man!

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:27.377 position:50% align:center
Drench him head
to toe with water!

00:10:29.588 --> 00:10:33.634 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM chuckles]
Go on and laugh it up.

00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:38.347 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Shriek with laughter at
this lonely, sad, pitiful excuse

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.641 position:50% align:center
for a woman!
Watch me get rejected,

00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:42.935 position:50% align:center
--then botch my pathetic curse!
--But I'm hot!

00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:44.561 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM] Watch me drown
in all my shame,

00:10:44.645 --> 00:10:46.688 position:50% align:center
and get a good laugh on me!

00:10:46.772 --> 00:10:49.399 position:50% align:center
Hoo boy, that's my team.

00:10:49.483 --> 00:10:51.568 position:50% align:center
What did I ever do
to deserve them?

00:10:51.652 --> 00:10:54.780 position:50% align:center
I'm sure the answer's not
all that hard to figure out.

00:10:59.243 --> 00:11:02.538 position:50% align:center
[SIX] What's so great about
a guy with money and power, huh?

00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:05.832 position:50% align:center
I mean, I thought I'd be getting
at least some action, by now.

00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:07.334 position:50% align:center
What you're after

00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:10.254 position:50% align:center
is a pretty, sexy girl who's
devoted to you, aren't you?

00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:12.506 position:50% align:center
You might as well save yourself
all the trouble and buy one of

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:14.550 position:50% align:center
Kisaragi's new
X-Rated androids.

00:11:14.633 --> 00:11:16.718 position:50% align:center
Uh. You're really suggesting

00:11:16.802 --> 00:11:19.555 position:50% align:center
I buy a "pretty girl
pervert android?"

00:11:19.638 --> 00:11:20.931 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
You're hearing things.

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.225 position:50% align:center
I never said the word "pervert."

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.519 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I found this when
I was surveying the castle

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:29.189 position:50% align:center
and acting "lost."
You have any idea what it is?

00:11:29.273 --> 00:11:30.899 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Oh, most definitely.

00:11:30.983 --> 00:11:33.318 position:50% align:center
This is a pod
for growing creepy stuff.

00:11:33.402 --> 00:11:36.530 position:50% align:center
A homunculus, or a clone
or something like that.

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:38.782 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Looks like
a cold sleep capsule to me.

00:11:38.866 --> 00:11:42.703 position:50% align:center
No. I guarantee they're brewing
up some hot girls in this thing.

Don't touch that!

00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:46.540 position:50% align:center
Are you that stupid?!

00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:48.834 position:50% align:center
I mean, any idiot would realize
that's something you don't put

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:50.377 position:50% align:center
your grubby little hands on!

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.254 position:50% align:center
Who's this fussy little shrimp?

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:54.548 position:50% align:center
I'm Agent Six,
an important ambassador from

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:57.968 position:50% align:center
the Kingdom of Grace.
So I'm kind of a big deal, okay?

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.261 position:50% align:center
Meaning, watch your tone!

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center
Are you really Agent Six?

00:12:01.555 --> 00:12:04.099 position:50% align:center
Can't believe Gadalkand
lost to a loser like you.

00:12:04.183 --> 00:12:05.726 position:50% align:center
What's a Gadalkand?

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:08.604 position:50% align:center
He was that Elite Four
Demon you decapitated.

00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:12.024 position:50% align:center
Heh. I guess Heine
was right about you.

00:12:12.107 --> 00:12:13.567 position:50% align:center
Not so bright.

Didn't expect to see you
bouncing around down here,

some handcuffs.

Stop! Listen up, Six!
I'm not your enemy today!

Hah!

00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:43.722 position:50% align:center

[RUSSEL growls]

00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:53.815 position:50% align:center
Nicely done, Six.

00:12:53.899 --> 00:12:56.735 position:50% align:center
You're using a woman
as hostage against a child.

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:58.654 position:50% align:center
I'm immensely proud
of you right now.

00:12:58.737 --> 00:13:01.281 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Okay. You said
your name is Russel, right?

00:13:01.365 --> 00:13:05.160 position:50% align:center
Pay attention. I'm just about
to get to the good part.

00:13:05.244 --> 00:13:07.412 position:50% align:center
You seem pretty
experienced, Heine.

00:13:07.496 --> 00:13:09.581 position:50% align:center
So you know what
happens to sexy girls,

00:13:09.665 --> 00:13:11.542 position:50% align:center

This man's being mean to me!

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:23.697 position:50% align:center
You're busted! You're gonna sell
those Water Stones to the demons

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.450 position:50% align:center
and then make some kind of
alliance with 'em, aren't ya?!

What?! Is this true?

00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:31.205 position:50% align:center
It's not an alliance! It's a
simple non-aggression pact!

that it's possible to negotiate

00:14:39.588 --> 00:14:42.758 position:50% align:center
There's a reason why the demons
waged war on humanity.

00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:44.051 position:50% align:center
You know that don't you?

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:45.636 position:50% align:center
Yes, Of course I do.

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:47.846 position:50% align:center
It's because their land has been
invaded by the huge beast

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.516 position:50% align:center
that turns everything
into a barren desert.

00:14:50.599 --> 00:14:52.768 position:50% align:center
So they can either
expand or lose it all.

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:55.270 position:50% align:center
Yes, as long as
the Sand King is out there,

00:14:55.354 --> 00:14:57.731 position:50% align:center
the Demon Lord will
continue to lose territory.

00:14:57.814 --> 00:15:00.400 position:50% align:center
So they won't take peace
as an option, it's just a ruse!

00:15:00.484 --> 00:15:02.653 position:50% align:center
What's more, if you're
busy trying to cash in while

00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:04.404 position:50% align:center
the rest of humanity
is all coming together

00:15:04.488 --> 00:15:07.074 position:50% align:center
to fight against them, the other
nations of the world might

00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:09.117 position:50% align:center
start to think that makes
you look like a traitor

00:15:09.201 --> 00:15:11.286 position:50% align:center
to your own kind.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:14.581 position:50% align:center
First she flirts, and then
she makes threats. Nice.

00:15:14.665 --> 00:15:18.001 position:50% align:center
Wrong, if you truly want to
broker a peaceful resolution,

00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:20.629 position:50% align:center
we would be happy
to discuss that with you.

00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:22.256 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
You're nothing but a liar!

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:24.216 position:50% align:center
I won't forget the men who died,

00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:27.719 position:50% align:center
and I will never forget
what you did to my sword!

00:15:27.803 --> 00:15:30.305 position:50% align:center
Gadalkand was slain
the last time we met--

00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:31.598 position:50% align:center
you're not blameless.

00:15:31.682 --> 00:15:32.933 position:50% align:center
[SNOW growls]

00:15:33.016 --> 00:15:35.394 position:50% align:center
[HEINE] And thanks to
Prince Engel's generosity,

00:15:35.477 --> 00:15:37.312 position:50% align:center
we think we can handle
the Sand King.

00:15:37.396 --> 00:15:39.773 position:50% align:center
Because if what the
Crown Prince told us is true,

00:15:39.857 --> 00:15:41.400 position:50% align:center
there's something in
the ancient ruins here

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:43.110 position:50% align:center
that can neutralize the threat.

00:15:43.193 --> 00:15:46.321 position:50% align:center
Ruins, huh?
Tillis mentioned those.

00:15:46.405 --> 00:15:47.614 position:50% align:center
Do you understand now?

00:15:47.698 --> 00:15:49.616 position:50% align:center
With the Sand King
taken out, there's no war.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.828 position:50% align:center
What we're hoping to accomplish
will benefit the entire world.

00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:55.622 position:50% align:center
But the threats you're making
will only be a barrier to peace,

00:15:55.706 --> 00:15:57.040 position:50% align:center
so who's the real traitor here?

00:15:57.124 --> 00:15:58.166 position:50% align:center
[SNOW growls]

00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:59.585 position:50% align:center
Grace wasn't buying
the water stones,

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:01.420 position:50% align:center
so we took them off their hands.

00:16:01.503 --> 00:16:04.590 position:50% align:center
Your little country isn't
the only one with needs.

00:16:04.673 --> 00:16:07.551 position:50% align:center
You think you can just demand
they give them to you?

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:08.552 position:50% align:center
Think again.

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:10.095 position:50% align:center
[SNOW growls]

00:16:10.179 --> 00:16:13.390 position:50% align:center
Although you may claim
to be an ally of Toris,

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:16.185 position:50% align:center
the reality looks quite a bit
different, now doesn't it?

00:16:16.268 --> 00:16:18.937 position:50% align:center
No. You'll stand with the people
of The Kingdom of Grace,

00:16:19.021 --> 00:16:20.606 position:50% align:center
right, Prince Engel?

00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:22.733 position:50% align:center
--[ENGEL] Hmm...
--[gasps]

00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:25.611 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I allowed myself
to get out of line earlier.

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:27.863 position:50% align:center
I know I've been
a very naughty girl.

00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:31.158 position:50% align:center
But we can still be friends.
I can learn how to be very good.

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:32.868 position:50% align:center
Hey, stop that!

00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:34.620 position:50% align:center
[snarls]

00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:37.039 position:50% align:center
Oh, Prince Engel.
Same for me.

00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:39.416 position:50% align:center
I can be a special friend, too.

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:42.252 position:50% align:center
What're you doing?! Are you
trying to seduce the prince?!

00:16:42.336 --> 00:16:43.295 position:50% align:center
You should be ashamed!

00:16:43.378 --> 00:16:44.838 position:50% align:center
You hypocrite!

00:16:44.922 --> 00:16:47.925 position:50% align:center
Hey, Prince Engel. I'm way cuter
than Miss Cow horns, right?

00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:51.178 position:50% align:center
Are you crazy?!
Anyone can see I'm far sexier!

00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:52.387 position:50% align:center
--[SNOW] Prince Engel!
--[HEINE] Prince Engel!

00:16:52.471 --> 00:16:54.806 position:50% align:center
Hang on. Why's
this chubby, ugly, schlub

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.558 position:50% align:center
have these women going crazy?

00:16:56.642 --> 00:16:57.851 position:50% align:center
Why aren't the ladies
treating me

00:16:57.935 --> 00:16:59.978 position:50% align:center
like the clichéd
harem protagonist?

00:17:00.062 --> 00:17:02.523 position:50% align:center
He's a Crown Prince and
you're a Clown Prince.

00:17:02.606 --> 00:17:03.899 position:50% align:center
[SIX groans]

00:17:03.982 --> 00:17:06.985 position:50% align:center
Look. I do appreciate this,
but this is not the way

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:08.987 position:50% align:center
diplomatic matters
should be settled.

00:17:09.071 --> 00:17:10.364 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:17:10.447 --> 00:17:13.242 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.
And please forgive my saying so,

00:17:13.325 --> 00:17:16.036 position:50% align:center
but your reputation as
a ladies' man is well known.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.622 position:50% align:center
Earlier, you couldn't take
your eyes off my cleavage.

00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:21.041 position:50% align:center
How could you have
changed so dramatically?

00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:22.459 position:50% align:center
[ENGEL]
I'm not exactly sure,

00:17:22.543 --> 00:17:24.253 position:50% align:center
but right before
this party began,

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:25.921 position:50% align:center
I had the strangest sensation,

00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:28.715 position:50% align:center
like I could feel myself
being reborn!

00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:30.968 position:50% align:center
My word! I've been
such a degenerate,

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:33.720 position:50% align:center
but the time has come for me
to turn over a new leaf!

00:17:33.804 --> 00:17:35.138 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Wow!

00:17:35.222 --> 00:17:37.432 position:50% align:center
You're so, honest! I know
my personality needs work,

00:17:37.516 --> 00:17:39.393 position:50% align:center
but I've got a cute face
and a tight body!

00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:40.602 position:50% align:center
Sweet prince!

00:17:40.686 --> 00:17:43.105 position:50% align:center
I'm a demon, but a very
supportive girlfriend!

00:17:43.188 --> 00:17:46.692 position:50% align:center
We're both human, so that means
we'd be much more compatible!

00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:49.403 position:50% align:center
Prince Engel!
I... know what you really need.

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:53.156 position:50% align:center
I don't know how I could be
clearer, but I'll try.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.326 position:50% align:center
I am not interested in
either of you in any way.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.078 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
I see.

00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:00.831 position:50% align:center
So he's actually more like
the clichéd harem protagonist

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:02.749 position:50% align:center
with no balls.

00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:05.294 position:50% align:center
[ENGEL chuckles]

[SIX gasps]

00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:10.632 position:50% align:center
I remember the pain of when I
tried to take a peek at Astaroth

00:18:10.716 --> 00:18:12.885 position:50% align:center
in the bath, but instead
I just saw Tiger Man

00:18:12.968 --> 00:18:14.428 position:50% align:center
scrubbing his junk.

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:16.638 position:50% align:center
Or all of those times when
the junior combat agents

00:18:16.722 --> 00:18:18.348 position:50% align:center
took my promotion.

00:18:18.432 --> 00:18:20.934 position:50% align:center
Even when that stupid hero
kicked my ass,

00:18:21.018 --> 00:18:23.395 position:50% align:center
I didn't feel nearly
this defeated.

00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:24.980 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
There a problem, Six?

00:18:25.063 --> 00:18:27.441 position:50% align:center
You look like you're actually
thinking about something.

00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:30.736 position:50% align:center
I have a feeling that's a
precursor to some stupid action.

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Alice.
I'm about to totally freak out.

00:18:34.198 --> 00:18:35.657 position:50% align:center
Will you please have my back?

00:18:35.741 --> 00:18:37.159 position:50% align:center

do what a man's gotta do.

your partner in this mission,

we are with the same evil group.

00:18:47.377 --> 00:18:50.839 position:50% align:center
And no matter what you do,
I'm with you to the bitter end.

00:18:50.923 --> 00:18:52.424 position:50% align:center

Hmph. Thank you, Alice.

You know, I don't see
why you're trying to pretend

00:19:00.891 --> 00:19:03.685 position:50% align:center
you're not terrible! I mean,
just look at how you dress,

00:19:03.769 --> 00:19:05.646 position:50% align:center
exposing yourself
while sucking up.

00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:08.690 position:50% align:center

pretty rich coming from you!

Excuse me, Prince Engel.

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:14.863 position:50% align:center
I've got a little party trick
that'll be perfect.

00:19:14.947 --> 00:19:17.366 position:50% align:center
It's just the thing to get
the vibe back on track.

Ah. A trick, you say?
Sounds like a good idea to me.

00:19:21.578 --> 00:19:25.290 position:50% align:center
Okay. Now, I just need you
to stay right where you are.

Wait, Six.

But meanwhile, we'll still need
to figure out how to get water.

00:21:09.811 --> 00:21:11.605 position:50% align:center
Tillis, did you forget?

00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:14.483 position:50% align:center
The artifact that makes the rain
fall has been repaired!

00:21:14.566 --> 00:21:15.901 position:50% align:center
And since we
can't find the King,

00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:18.862 position:50% align:center
you're going to get to say
the incantation yourself.

00:21:18.946 --> 00:21:21.073 position:50% align:center
I have a much better idea.

00:21:21.156 --> 00:21:23.575 position:50% align:center
You've heard of the mysterious
water nut, haven't you?

00:21:23.659 --> 00:21:25.994 position:50% align:center
They say it grows only in the
middle of the Tezan desert,

00:21:26.078 --> 00:21:28.539 position:50% align:center
which is deep inside
the Sand King's territory.

00:21:28.622 --> 00:21:30.958 position:50% align:center
Um. I've heard of it.

00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:33.877 position:50% align:center
You can get a massive load
of liquid from a single nut.

00:21:33.961 --> 00:21:35.295 position:50% align:center
And you want me...

00:21:35.379 --> 00:21:37.005 position:50% align:center
...to get one.

00:21:37.089 --> 00:21:40.300 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
No! This is terrible!

00:21:40.384 --> 00:21:42.719 position:50% align:center
They sent us into
the Sand King's territory?

00:21:42.803 --> 00:21:44.471 position:50% align:center
This is a suicide mission!

00:21:44.555 --> 00:21:45.973 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:48.267 position:50% align:center
Supposedly, the Sand King
is only active during the day.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.769 position:50% align:center
We just gotta make our move
at night to grab deez nuts,

00:21:50.853 --> 00:21:52.271 position:50% align:center
and then head back to Grace.

00:21:52.354 --> 00:21:54.648 position:50% align:center
They're gonna pay.
Every one of them.

00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:56.608 position:50% align:center
Harmel and his stupid fiancée.

00:21:56.692 --> 00:21:58.652 position:50% align:center
Gilbert and his obese,
ugly wife.

00:21:58.735 --> 00:22:02.531 position:50% align:center
Every single man in that country
is gonna regret turning me down.

00:22:02.614 --> 00:22:04.908 position:50% align:center
Hey, Grimm. I've been meaning
to ask you about something

00:22:04.992 --> 00:22:07.119 position:50% align:center
that I can't get out of my mind.

00:22:07.202 --> 00:22:09.538 position:50% align:center
I'll curse you if it's stupid.
Be warned.

00:22:09.621 --> 00:22:12.749 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Well. It's about
the curse that other night.

00:22:12.833 --> 00:22:14.960 position:50% align:center
I dodged it, but then
what happened?

00:22:15.043 --> 00:22:17.921 position:50% align:center
Oh, that? It would've
just kept on going until

00:22:18.005 --> 00:22:21.383 position:50% align:center
it ran into another life
form and activated.

00:22:21.466 --> 00:22:22.801 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:22:22.885 --> 00:22:24.928 position:50% align:center
So that curse of impotence
just flew out of the room,

00:22:25.012 --> 00:22:26.805 position:50% align:center
then the famously horny
prince suddenly lost

00:22:26.889 --> 00:22:28.265 position:50% align:center
all interest in women.

00:22:28.348 --> 00:22:29.474 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM]
Hey, Commander!

00:22:29.558 --> 00:22:31.768 position:50% align:center
I think little secrets
are sexy, don't you?

00:22:31.852 --> 00:22:32.936 position:50% align:center
I actually don't.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.438 position:50% align:center
Check this out, team!

00:22:34.521 --> 00:22:36.481 position:50% align:center
You'll never believe what ol'
Grimm did the other night!

00:22:36.565 --> 00:22:37.900 position:50% align:center
--It's super crazy!
--[GRIMM] Hold on!

00:22:37.983 --> 00:22:40.444 position:50% align:center
All I did was help Snow
keep her chastity!

00:22:40.527 --> 00:22:42.696 position:50% align:center
We girls need to stick together
and protect each other

00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:44.114 position:50% align:center
from creepy men who just want--

00:22:44.198 --> 00:22:46.992 position:50% align:center
[SIX] You're too old to
call yourself a girl, granny!

00:22:47.075 --> 00:22:51.121 position:50% align:center
Hear me, O Great Lord Zenarith!
Bring despair upon this man!

00:22:51.205 --> 00:22:53.624 position:50% align:center
Make it so he's unable
to pleasure himself!

00:22:53.707 --> 00:22:55.042 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Hey, watch it!

00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:57.794 position:50% align:center
If I can't do it myself,
I'm gonna use your doll instead!

00:22:57.878 --> 00:22:59.463 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM]
Don't violate my assistant!

00:22:59.546 --> 00:23:03.467 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Ugh, enough! Don't
make me turn this car around!

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:06.178 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] "I went to
a big party at a castle!"

00:23:06.261 --> 00:23:08.805 position:50% align:center
What?! That's not
an acceptable report!

00:23:08.889 --> 00:23:11.266 position:50% align:center
Six is having
the time of his life.

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:12.935 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, we're out
risking our arses

00:23:13.018 --> 00:23:14.937 position:50% align:center
fighting against these heroes.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.855 position:50% align:center
Well, I hate parties,
to be honest.

00:23:16.939 --> 00:23:19.358 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] Me, too!
All the ugly people in power

00:23:19.441 --> 00:23:21.527 position:50% align:center
with the pathetic lowbies
sucking up to them.

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:24.112 position:50% align:center
Bribes and disgusting
backroom deals being made.

00:23:24.196 --> 00:23:26.698 position:50% align:center
The stench of corruption
burns my nostrils.

00:23:26.782 --> 00:23:28.242 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:23:28.325 --> 00:23:30.160 position:50% align:center
--Say, "Ahh."
--Um. What're you--

00:23:33.038 --> 00:23:35.791 position:50% align:center
It's much more fun to hang out
with people you like, isn't it?

00:23:35.874 --> 00:23:36.792 position:50% align:center
Well, I--

00:23:36.875 --> 00:23:37.960 position:50% align:center
Oh, bloody hell.

00:23:38.043 --> 00:23:40.546 position:50% align:center
Well. I got my sugar recharge.

00:23:40.629 --> 00:23:43.257 position:50% align:center
So back at it.
Time to get more work done.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.466 position:50% align:center
Let's get it!

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.635 position:50% align:center
Okay, but when we do
beat all those heroes,

00:23:46.718 --> 00:23:48.428 position:50% align:center
we should throw a big
party of our own.

00:23:48.512 --> 00:23:49.513 position:50% align:center
[LILITH, BELIAL]
Huzzah!
