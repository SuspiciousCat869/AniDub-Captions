With pleasure.

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:12.924 position:50% align:center

every lovey-dovey
couple in the city

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.804 position:50% align:center

scared of the rebound effect!

[ROSE] My grandpa told me
this as he was dying.

I ever made a friend,

there for them!

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:50.040 position:50% align:center

Stop right there, Snow.

I'm not exactly sure what
you're planning to do,

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.390 position:50% align:center
but take the word
of an archpriest

[TILLIS] No! I'm staying
right here with my people!

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:53.978 position:50% align:center

and tell our story

much time left, Six!

We gotta get while
the gettin's good!

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:36.146 position:50% align:center
And right now there are
a bunch of other people

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.481 position:50% align:center
that'll keep the demons
way too busy to kill us.

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:40.525 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] Wow, you just
came right out and said it.

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:42.902 position:50% align:center
At least you're
honestly terrible.

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:45.447 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Still though...

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.241 position:50% align:center
Rose and Grimm
are holding off the enemy.

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:49.325 position:50% align:center
For now...

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:52.996 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
But they won't last.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:56.332 position:50% align:center
I apologize for anything I may
have done to anger you.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:57.459 position:50% align:center
So please...

00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:00.712 position:50% align:center
Please, Six!
Stay here and help us!

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:03.465 position:50% align:center
I'm willing to do
whatever you ask of me!

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:06.092 position:50% align:center
I'll give you money!
Or my sword!

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:07.677 position:50% align:center
I probably shouldn't say this,

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:10.096 position:50% align:center
but I'm pretty stingy,
so there's a lot of cash.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.598 position:50% align:center
I'll give you everything!

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.892 position:50% align:center
Hey, Six. Please ignore her.

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:15.560 position:50% align:center
We're using all
the Evil Points you have left

00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:17.228 position:50% align:center
to make our escape.

00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
We don't have enough
to help her, too.

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:24.235 position:50% align:center
Not my problem.

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:27.197 position:50% align:center
I'm just a regular
ol' schmuck of a civilian.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.158 position:50% align:center
You know that. 'Cuz it's
all your fault, remember?

[SNOW groans]

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:34.079 position:50% align:center
How can you be so callous?

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.538 position:50% align:center
[SIX] It's another perk
of being a member

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:37.707 position:50% align:center
of an evil organization.

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:48.343 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] It's painful. I worked
hard to get where I am,

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:51.680 position:50% align:center
but still, the enemy
barely even noticed me!

00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:54.265 position:50% align:center
[sobs]

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:57.727 position:50% align:center

[SNOW sobs]

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:04.025 position:50% align:center
Please help me, Commander!

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:05.026 position:50% align:center

Uhh...

[ALICE] I'm very
disappointed in you, Six.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:17.539 position:50% align:center
You've managed to find a new way
to be an abysmal failure

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:19.124 position:50% align:center
of a villain.

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:20.792 position:50% align:center
A lowbie who's
been with Kisaragi

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:22.961 position:50% align:center
longer than anyone
but its top brass.

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:25.005 position:50% align:center
This is why you'll
never move up.

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:26.631 position:50% align:center
Oh, shut your hole!

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:29.718 position:50% align:center
Just have 'em send me
that anti-material rifle!

[ALICE]
If you go back to headquarters

00:22:10.372 --> 00:22:12.707 position:50% align:center
with that many negative points,
the punishment squad will be

00:22:12.791 --> 00:22:14.084 position:50% align:center
waiting to greet you.

00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:16.127 position:50% align:center
Then what am I supposed to do?!

00:22:16.211 --> 00:22:19.047 position:50% align:center
Listen, carefully.
Even after we have the ability

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:21.758 position:50% align:center
to make it back home,
you'll need to stay here.

00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:23.551 position:50% align:center
At least until you get
your points back up

00:22:23.635 --> 00:22:25.053 position:50% align:center
in positive territory.

00:22:25.136 --> 00:22:26.054 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay!

00:22:26.137 --> 00:22:27.555 position:50% align:center
We'll need an alibi.

00:22:27.639 --> 00:22:30.642 position:50% align:center
Something to put in the reports
why you can't come home.

00:22:30.725 --> 00:22:33.353 position:50% align:center
And I think I should stay here
with you while you're trying

00:22:33.436 --> 00:22:35.063 position:50% align:center
to acquire enough points.

00:22:35.146 --> 00:22:37.023 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Ah! Oh, thank you!

00:22:37.107 --> 00:22:39.901 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you can cut that creepy
stuff out right now, okay?

00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:41.861 position:50% align:center
Just concentrate on
getting back in the black.

00:22:41.945 --> 00:22:44.447 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! On it, partner!

00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:46.825 position:50% align:center
And to get things started,
I'm gonna go and strip my unit

00:22:46.908 --> 00:22:49.077 position:50% align:center
completely nekkers!

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.870 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Uh, seriously?

00:22:50.954 --> 00:22:52.622 position:50% align:center
And what do you
mean by "partner"?

00:22:52.706 --> 00:22:53.998 position:50% align:center
[SIX] I'm gonna be rolllin'
in evil points, baby!

00:22:54.082 --> 00:22:55.917 position:50% align:center
I mean, I'm a support android.

00:23:03.216 --> 00:23:04.384 position:50% align:center
--[ALICE] Partner, huh...?
--[SIX] Here I come!

00:23:04.467 --> 00:23:05.385 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Does sound nice...

00:23:05.468 --> 00:23:07.137 position:50% align:center
[SIX cackles]

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.516 position:50% align:center
It seems Alice had
a really cracking idea!

00:23:11.599 --> 00:23:13.435 position:50% align:center
With her plan, we can
keep our combat agents

00:23:13.518 --> 00:23:15.020 position:50% align:center
employed after we conquer Earth!

00:23:15.103 --> 00:23:16.104 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL, ASTAROTH]
Hmm?

00:23:16.187 --> 00:23:18.064 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
A combatant dispatch plan?

00:23:18.148 --> 00:23:19.733 position:50% align:center
[LILITH] The world that they're
on needs more people

00:23:19.816 --> 00:23:20.942 position:50% align:center
who know how to fight.

00:23:21.026 --> 00:23:23.403 position:50% align:center
So she proposes that
we send them there!

00:23:23.486 --> 00:23:25.739 position:50% align:center
But then, wouldn't that
make us the good guy?

00:23:25.822 --> 00:23:27.407 position:50% align:center
And Six supports it!

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.409 position:50% align:center
He will run the office.

00:23:29.492 --> 00:23:31.119 position:50% align:center
The war tearing that
world apart has killed

00:23:31.202 --> 00:23:32.579 position:50% align:center
many of the younger men.

00:23:32.662 --> 00:23:35.623 position:50% align:center
So there are scores of hot,
lonely women in his area!

00:23:35.707 --> 00:23:37.834 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH sighs]
Yes, he does mention the ladies

00:23:37.917 --> 00:23:39.794 position:50% align:center
quite a bit in his reports.

00:23:39.878 --> 00:23:42.172 position:50% align:center
[gasps] But Six'll still
be coming back to us

00:23:42.255 --> 00:23:44.549 position:50% align:center
--someday, won't he?!
--[LILITH warbling]

00:23:44.632 --> 00:23:46.551 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] I mean, he's not
gonna marry some alien woman

00:23:46.634 --> 00:23:49.429 position:50% align:center
and then settle down,
right? Right?!
