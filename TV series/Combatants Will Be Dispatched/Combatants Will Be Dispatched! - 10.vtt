[ASTAROTH] Soon, this world will
be ours to rule as we please.

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:20.770 position:50% align:center
We managed to fend off
the heroes' in their last

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:23.023 position:50% align:center
major counter-offensive, but...

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:25.734 position:50% align:center
[TROOPS]
Cheers!

[cheering, laughter]

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.920 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] Aren't we all
taking it a little too easy?

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.673 position:50% align:center
That last battle we fought
was a real ass-kicker--

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.717 position:50% align:center
of course the troops
wanna cut loose.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.345 position:50% align:center
I think they earned
themselves a night of peace.

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.388 position:50% align:center
I don't disagree with you.

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:58.183 position:50% align:center
But, I guess I just feel guilty
about relaxing while Six

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:01.019 position:50% align:center
and his crew are out
working in the field.

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:04.606 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL grunts] You worry too
much, you know that, Astaroth?

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.733 position:50% align:center
At least try to unwind.

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:09.903 position:50% align:center
If our agents find out that
their leaders are still working,

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:11.654 position:50% align:center
then they'll think
they have to do the same.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:15.116 position:50% align:center
All right, fine. This is just
for tonight though, right?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.494 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah! Now why don't
the two of us have some fun?

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.329 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH gasps]
Hey! What're you--?!

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:20.747 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL]
Take that off and swim with me!

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.457 position:50% align:center
We can warm up with
a thousand-meter race!

[ASTAROTH gasps]

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.919 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL] Why so embarrassed?!
It's just us girls here!

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:28.129 position:50% align:center
We may as well
swim "au naturale."

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:29.506 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
What are you, crazy?!

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:31.174 position:50% align:center

[SIX]
I'm back.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.407 position:50% align:center
I've left the mutant mummy woman

00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:21.117 position:50% align:center
on her weird
little altar for now.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:22.911 position:50% align:center
She should be in
decent shape by morning.

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:25.038 position:50% align:center
Thank you. That's good to hear.

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:27.415 position:50% align:center
We'll wait for that to bring
the gloomy freak back to life,

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:29.834 position:50% align:center
and then head straight
for the ruins at Toris.

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:31.961 position:50% align:center
So attend to whatever
business you have now.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.130 position:50% align:center
Roger that. I'd say
my first order of business

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:36.925 position:50% align:center
is to bitch out
dear ol' Astaroth.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:38.968 position:50% align:center
Who crapped in
your litterbox meow?

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.178 position:50% align:center
Metaphorically speaking,

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:42.430 position:50% align:center
Astaroth took
a big ol' dump in it.

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:44.599 position:50% align:center
She banned me from going
into negative evil points,

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:47.727 position:50% align:center
so she's lucky my carcass isn't
out there baking in the desert.

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:49.187 position:50% align:center
Oh, right, about that,

Hmm?

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.447 position:50% align:center

It's from Lilith.

it's prob'ly ransomware,

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.085 position:50% align:center
but go for it.

you for a second there.

the camera angle from here, Six.

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:37.736 position:50% align:center
[SIX] What gives?
I'm gearin' up to risk my life

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.321 position:50% align:center
in a major battle against
the Demon Lord's army

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:43.283 position:50% align:center
while they get to
have a pool party?

[ATTENDEES murmuring]

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:46.953 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL]
What're they so excited about?

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:49.497 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] Probably
the yearly employee survey.

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:52.167 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL] I'm surprised that they
haven't gotten bored of it yet.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.543 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
Same here.

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:56.796 position:50% align:center
Who's the idiot that came up
with that survey anyway?

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.507 position:50% align:center
If memory serves, you can
thank Six for that survey.

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:01.176 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
It was him?

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.635 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
Here, have another.

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
Mm... Thank you.

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:06.598 position:50% align:center
But of course,
Anyway, it started when

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:08.350 position:50% align:center
Praying Mantis Woman
and Spider Woman

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
both fancied Six. They wanted
him to indicate his preference

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:15.273 position:50% align:center
between them so they asked
him whom he'd prefer for a boss.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:17.025 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL]
Those two would go for him.

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:20.362 position:50% align:center
Six has always been
an absolute magnet for weirdos.

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:22.822 position:50% align:center
Damn straight.
[gulps]

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:25.617 position:50% align:center
Of course, he dodged the
question with some nonsense

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.912 position:50% align:center
like, "How could I choose?
You are both so wonderful!"

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.455 position:50% align:center
Yup. I believe it.

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:33.708 position:50% align:center
Dumbass prob'ly thinks he's
too much of a stud for one girl.

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:35.460 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You're right.

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:38.797 position:50% align:center
Yes, well that gave him the idea
to put out a company-wide survey

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.341 position:50% align:center
to determine who's more popular.

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:44.552 position:50% align:center
They ended up tying,
so the survey was inconclusive.

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:47.806 position:50% align:center
But Spider Woman and Praying
Mantis Woman bonded over it--

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.226 position:50% align:center
and have since become
a most dynamic duo.

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:52.644 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Yeah!

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:55.230 position:50% align:center
He may seem like an empty-headed
perv at first glance,

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:57.732 position:50% align:center
but I think Six might be
an intelligent perv.

00:05:57.816 --> 00:06:00.485 position:50% align:center
Guess it's possible,
but I doubt Six actually thought

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:02.112 position:50% align:center
that mess through.

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:05.740 position:50% align:center
The rest of the company's
livin' it up back on Earth

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:07.867 position:50% align:center
while I'm stuck here.
This is bull.

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:09.369 position:50% align:center
I've been workin' way
harder than any of them,

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:11.579 position:50% align:center
so why don't I get to have fun?

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:13.415 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
I get it now.

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:16.668 position:50% align:center
It's a tactic commonly
employed by drug dealers.

never been much for gambling.

then I'll bet on myself.

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:10.013 position:50% align:center
You get last place
every year though.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.556 position:50% align:center
You don't even stand a chance.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.350 position:50% align:center
Sure I do, now that
you've said that,

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.060 position:50% align:center
I think I'm guaranteed to win.

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:18.063 position:50% align:center
Those who underestimate
me will fail.

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:21.524 position:50% align:center
Yes, for I'm Kisaragi's
most brilliant scientist!

Who doesn't love
Lilith the Dark?

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
You think she's bribing
her way to victory?

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:27.447 position:50% align:center
She blows her cash
as soon as she makes it,

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.366 position:50% align:center
so I doubt that she
has enough money.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.284 position:50% align:center
This is probably
just an empty threat.

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:33.953 position:50% align:center
I hear everything
you're saying, you fools!

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:36.498 position:50% align:center
If I did bet, I'd
put my money on you, Belial--

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:38.583 position:50% align:center
you're very popular
with the agents.

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.543 position:50% align:center
See? You're in the lead now.

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:43.588 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL] Come on, Astaroth,
you're making me blush.

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:45.674 position:50% align:center
Listen, it's clear that you
always have your employees'

00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:47.759 position:50% align:center
best interests at heart.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:50.095 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they see
and appreciate that.

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:53.723 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] Thanks, but I also
issue a lot of harsh orders.

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:57.519 position:50% align:center
And besides, the results of that
survey aren't important to me.

00:07:57.602 --> 00:08:00.563 position:50% align:center
Uh, what? Well, they're
super important to me.

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.857 position:50% align:center
Look, we ask the agents
to put their lives in our hands

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:04.984 position:50% align:center
all the time,
but they're only gonna do that

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50% align:center
if they have faith in us.

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:08.196 position:50% align:center
Even if the survey's
a bit of a joke,

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:10.782 position:50% align:center
it lets us know
they still trust us.

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:12.742 position:50% align:center
Right. I suppose it's
a useful practice

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:15.161 position:50% align:center
for that reason,
if nothing else.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:18.206 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
Here. Have another.

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:20.583 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
Ah. Umm, thanks again.

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.669 position:50% align:center
You claim not to care about
the survey's results,

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:25.714 position:50% align:center
but you'd still like to know
who Six voted for, right?

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:27.215 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
Huh...?

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:28.591 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:31.428 position:50% align:center
Ah, I'm not curious about
who anyone voted for!

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:32.846 position:50% align:center
Why would I be?!

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.681 position:50% align:center
You know? It's hard to believe,

00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:37.684 position:50% align:center
but that idiot Lilith's kinda
makin' herself useful for once.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:39.310 position:50% align:center
It's a worldwide stream.

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:42.439 position:50% align:center
I get that this organization
is evil and all,

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.691 position:50% align:center
but this girl is
pawsitively ruthless.

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:47.610 position:50% align:center
She should draw the line
somewhere, meow!

00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:48.945 position:50% align:center
I wanna see what
happens to her

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:50.989 position:50% align:center
when they find out
what she's doing.

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:53.366 position:50% align:center
I imagine they'll make
an example out of her.

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.119 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
It's just us girls here.

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.163 position:50% align:center
You don't need
to be so reserved.

00:08:58.246 --> 00:08:59.622 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's true.

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:02.083 position:50% align:center
We, like, pretty much know,
so ya might as well talk.

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:04.377 position:50% align:center
[LILITH] Just tell us
how you feel, darling.

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.463 position:50% align:center
Uh... Well, yeah.
I guess I'd be lying

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:09.507 position:50% align:center
if I tried to tell you that
I didn't care who Six voted for.

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:10.717 position:50% align:center
--[BELIAL] Ah-hah?!
--[LILITH] Are you serious?!

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.053 position:50% align:center
Though, what do you
want me to say?

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:16.264 position:50% align:center
He's been an irredeemable idiot
ever since his first interview.

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:18.058 position:50% align:center
And yet over all of these years,

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:20.185 position:50% align:center
I suppose we grew
to be kind of close.

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:22.896 position:50% align:center
He's been there for me
when no one else was.

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:25.315 position:50% align:center
He doesn't ever whine
about his low salary...

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.484 position:50% align:center
I seem to remember him
whining plenty.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.736 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] ...he takes risky
missions without complaining...

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:32.405 position:50% align:center
He was literally just bitching
about the current one.

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:34.157 position:50% align:center
Fine! So he complains
all the time!

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.617 position:50% align:center
He still does the work!

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.912 position:50% align:center
I'm biased! He's got
a lengthy list of flaws.

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:41.706 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
But that changes nothing for me!

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:44.417 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] I've worked
at his side ever since

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:47.879 position:50% align:center
we founded Kisaragi! Of course
I've developed an attachment!

00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:49.172 position:50% align:center
Yeah! That's the spirit, girl!

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.091 position:50% align:center
Your secret's safe with us,
so spill the tea!

00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:54.135 position:50% align:center
Wah! Wait. I feel like
you should save the rest.

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:55.970 position:50% align:center
If you have anything else
to say, then you should wait

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:57.597 position:50% align:center
and say it to him in private!

00:09:57.681 --> 00:09:59.057 position:50% align:center
What's gotten into you, Lilith?!

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.351 position:50% align:center
She's just about to get to
the good part, so shut it!

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:02.602 position:50% align:center
It's hard! The fact is,

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:04.771 position:50% align:center
I don't have any free time
to spend with him.

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
The free-world's shrinking, but
my workload's getting bigger!

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:10.610 position:50% align:center
And once the world's ours, we'll
be pressured to lay off agents--

00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:11.736 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
No! Don't say that!

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.822 position:50% align:center
What if someone happens
to overhear you?

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:17.617 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] It's fine.
I am Astaroth the Ice Queen,

00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:20.412 position:50% align:center
one of Kisaragi's
highest-ranked leaders.

00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:23.498 position:50% align:center
And I am working hard to protect
our combat agents' jobs.

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:25.417 position:50% align:center
All five million of them.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.712 position:50% align:center
I'll fight for them
as they fought for us.

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:33.299 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:39.139 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:42.267 position:50% align:center
[dinging]

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.435 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
Huh?]

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:45.770 position:50% align:center
[VOICE 1A]
You earned evil points!

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.191 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
Uh...

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:52.068 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL growls]

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:53.987 position:50% align:center
[LILITH chuckles weakly]

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.113 position:50% align:center
U-Uh!

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:56.906 position:50% align:center
Sorry...?
[chuckles]

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:09.711 position:50% align:center
[LILITH groans softly]

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:15.133 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH sobbing]

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.721 position:50% align:center
You're the worst! It's your
fault, so fix it, okay?!

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:21.389 position:50% align:center
You're the
self-proclaimed genius!

00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:24.642 position:50% align:center
Not sure why you had to throw
in the "self-proclaimed" part.

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:26.770 position:50% align:center
But all right.

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:29.397 position:50% align:center
The cause of Astaroth's
breakdown is clear.

00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
She realized Six heard all the
sweet things she said about him.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.237 position:50% align:center
So we'll call Six, and make him
say something sweet to her,

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:37.572 position:50% align:center
restoring the balance
between them.

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:39.240 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL]
Spicy.

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:40.533 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
Agent Six.

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:42.911 position:50% align:center
I trust that you heard
what I said just now?

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:45.330 position:50% align:center
So go ahead and launch into
a confession of your own

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:47.540 position:50% align:center
when you're ready!

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:48.875 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
Huh...?

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.378 position:50% align:center
I went ahead and recorded
this entire stream.

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
Now I can relive
the magic every single day.

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:55.465 position:50% align:center
--[ASTAROTH] No!
--[dinging]

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:58.551 position:50% align:center
[VOICE 1A]
You earned evil points!

00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:02.722 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH blubbering]

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
You're such an idiot!
Look what you've done!

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.102 position:50% align:center
What'll we do now?!

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:08.937 position:50% align:center
Wait! It's not over!
We still have a chance!

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.021 position:50% align:center
Check out the survey!

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:11.398 position:50% align:center
It looks like she's
taking the lead!

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:13.358 position:50% align:center
--She might win!
--Oh, right!

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:15.527 position:50% align:center
Everyone just heard her
vow to protect their jobs.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.154 position:50% align:center
And since she clearly didn't
know about the live stream,

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:20.865 position:50% align:center
it's pretty dang obvious
that she was being sincere!

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:22.283 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
Yes! Exactly!

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:24.160 position:50% align:center
The alcohol made her
embarrass herself, sure,

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:25.704 position:50% align:center
but in a way,
that's cute and endearing--

00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:28.164 position:50% align:center
Just stop talking and let me
pretend I don't exist, will you?

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:29.666 position:50% align:center
[VOICE 1A]
You earned evil points!

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:33.461 position:50% align:center
It's not a big deal, so calm
down and climb outta there.

00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:37.257 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL grunts]
Great, now get ready.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.092 position:50% align:center
A bunch of agents
heard whatcha said,

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.761 position:50% align:center
and decided to change
how they voted 'cause of it!

00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:44.139 position:50% align:center
You've gotta be
in first place now!

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:46.641 position:50% align:center
I don't want to be
in first place anymore.

00:12:46.725 --> 00:12:49.477 position:50% align:center
Not if the price
is abject humiliation.

00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:52.188 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL]
Oh, come on. It's not that bad.

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:54.482 position:50% align:center
Come take a look with me.

00:12:54.566 --> 00:12:55.775 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
Um...

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:58.528 position:50% align:center
--[BELIAL] Hmm?
--[LILITH gasps]

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:06.786 position:50% align:center
Do I need glasses or
is Lilith in first place?

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:07.787 position:50% align:center
What did you pull?!

00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:09.539 position:50% align:center
Hey. I know losing
can be painful,

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:11.291 position:50% align:center
but that's no reason
to get violent.

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:13.501 position:50% align:center
Don't play dumb, you were way
more confident than you had

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:15.837 position:50% align:center
any right to be when you
said you'd bet against me.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.715 position:50% align:center
You must've cheated, how else
could you jump to first place--

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:21.426 position:50% align:center
I'll ask you to refrain from
making accusations without proof

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:23.470 position:50% align:center
lest you ruin the bond we share.

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:26.723 position:50% align:center
Uh. Fair. Sorry 'bout that.

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:29.351 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry you had to
witness that nastiness, Six.

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:31.061 position:50% align:center
Why'd you let her off the hook?
She obviously chea--

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:33.646 position:50% align:center
[LILITH mimicking SIX]
"She obviously didn't cheat."

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.024 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL] Lilith... Did you think
there was a chance in hell

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:37.942 position:50% align:center
that voice would fool us?

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:39.235 position:50% align:center
[mimicking SIX]
"What voice?

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:40.904 position:50% align:center
This rivalry of yours has
gone on long enough,

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:43.698 position:50% align:center
so just accept that
Lilith is on top now."

00:13:43.782 --> 00:13:45.909 position:50% align:center
I'm feeling thirsty!
Grab me a soda!

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:48.578 position:50% align:center
Hop to, Belial--your number
one's given you a command!

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.622 position:50% align:center
--[snarls]
--[chuckles]

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:52.624 position:50% align:center
--[ASTAROTH] Hey.
--[BOTH] Ah?

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:53.625 position:50% align:center
Everything okay?

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:55.919 position:50% align:center
The voting results updated.

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:59.923 position:50% align:center
And Lilith has gained
more votes than we have agents.

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:01.508 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL]
No way!

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.051 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:04.177 position:50% align:center

[LILITH chuckles]

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:07.389 position:50% align:center
Eh.

00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:10.850 position:50% align:center
You. Little. Turd!

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:14.896 position:50% align:center
Gotcha, so it was hacking
after all, then?

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:16.648 position:50% align:center
I've already
punished the perp.

00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:19.567 position:50% align:center
Just be sure to kill
the fake votes for Lilith.

00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:22.696 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] Oh. Um. It looks
like I'm in the lead now.

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:25.532 position:50% align:center
Not that I care who wins.

00:14:25.615 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
Silly as this survey may be,

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:30.078 position:50% align:center
it does bring up some
nice memories for me.

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
It takes me back
to when we first met.

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:35.792 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH chuckles]

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:40.714 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL sighs]

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
Well, every time that
survey came around,

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:45.510 position:50% align:center
I'd do what I could
to help you out.

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:47.178 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
So. You'll vote for her, right?

00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:49.389 position:50% align:center
I'll buy your next lunch
if you do, capiche?

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:51.808 position:50% align:center
Whatcha think?
Do we have a deal or not?

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:53.268 position:50% align:center
Fine. I'll throw in another one!

00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:54.894 position:50% align:center
Ay-bada-bing!

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:58.189 position:50% align:center
I ran one hell of
a crooked campaign.

00:14:58.273 --> 00:15:01.359 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I didn't authorize you
to run any kind of campaign,

00:15:01.443 --> 00:15:03.361 position:50% align:center
but well, when we talked,
you said you weren't

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:07.032 position:50% align:center
asking permission
and ignored my wishes.

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:09.576 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Was I a nuisance?

00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:13.329 position:50% align:center
Not really. In fact, I'd say
it lifted my spirits some.

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:15.999 position:50% align:center
I never thought I'd win,
but it was nice to see someone

00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:19.711 position:50% align:center
believe in me.
So thank you.

00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:20.962 position:50% align:center
Oh. Sure.

00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:23.381 position:50% align:center
But this is the one time
I didn't do anything.

00:15:23.465 --> 00:15:26.551 position:50% align:center
And, well, it makes me happy
to hear ya say all this,

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:27.761 position:50% align:center
but listen...

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] Huh? Um,
is something wrong, Six?

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:31.514 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:33.475 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Uh. Uh...

00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:34.642 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:37.437 position:50% align:center
Lilith just got over
15 million votes.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.480 position:50% align:center
Yipe!

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:39.981 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:15:40.065 --> 00:15:41.232 position:50% align:center
Hup!

00:15:41.316 --> 00:15:43.276 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH groans]

[ATTENDEES groaning]

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:47.530 position:50% align:center
You're a plucky little gremlin,
I'll give ya that.

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:49.282 position:50% align:center
Wait. Just hear me out.

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:50.784 position:50% align:center
This isn't what
you think, honestly.

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:51.951 position:50% align:center
You better talk quickly.

00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:53.912 position:50% align:center
Right, well, as you know,
I'm a genius.

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:55.413 position:50% align:center
So before this started,
I actually put

00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:57.123 position:50% align:center
two plans in motion.

00:15:57.207 --> 00:15:59.042 position:50% align:center
Oh, and this second
plan isn't cheating!

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:00.919 position:50% align:center
Those votes were cast by people!

00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:03.380 position:50% align:center
You've gone three times over
the number of combat agents

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:05.924 position:50% align:center
in the entire organization.

00:16:06.007 --> 00:16:08.301 position:50% align:center
You're sure you didn't cheat?

00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:09.886 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL grunts]

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:11.262 position:50% align:center
There was no need to cheat.

00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:13.515 position:50% align:center
I simply hired a few million
new agents to serve as

00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:15.725 position:50% align:center
my new voter base!

00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
I gave 'em quite the deal.
Seven days off a week!

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:20.355 position:50% align:center
Five-hundred thousand a month!

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:22.315 position:50% align:center
Instant hires
with no interviews!

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:24.150 position:50% align:center
All they had to do was
write "Lilith the Dark"

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:25.902 position:50% align:center
on their company surveys!

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:28.905 position:50% align:center
For a genius such as me,
it was all too easy!

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:33.535 position:50% align:center
Your recent behavior
is really opening my eyes.

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:36.413 position:50% align:center
I'm starting to realize
you're dumber than me and Six.

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:37.747 position:50% align:center
We were already looking
at the prospect

00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:39.833 position:50% align:center
of company-wide layoffs.

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:42.669 position:50% align:center
How in the world do you expect
to pay all these new hires?

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:44.796 position:50% align:center
Easy. I'm not going to!

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:47.465 position:50% align:center
We're an evil
corporation, right?

00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:49.801 position:50% align:center
Those imbeciles should've
known they were getting conned.

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:52.262 position:50% align:center
We pay veteran combat agents
a fraction of that sum,

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:55.098 position:50% align:center
treat them as expendable assets,
and work them like dogs.

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:56.683 position:50% align:center
--[ALICE, SIX] Ouch.
--[TIGER] Meowch.

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:59.978 position:50% align:center
[LILITH] My word, the two of you
like to put on an evil front,

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:02.689 position:50% align:center
but it's plain to see that
you're just a pair of softies.

00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:05.191 position:50% align:center
Honestly, you're lucky
I like that about you.

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:08.319 position:50% align:center
I find it quite cute.
Hey, you know what?

00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:09.696 position:50% align:center
As a sign of my affection.

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:12.032 position:50% align:center
I'll withdraw from
the running this year.

00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:13.616 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL]
No.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.994 position:50% align:center
You're not walking outta here
till you've faced consequences.

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:18.371 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I'm amazed you
even tried to talk your way

00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:19.664 position:50% align:center
out of all this.

00:17:19.748 --> 00:17:21.166 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
All right, All right.

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:23.585 position:50% align:center
You can dock my pay
this month, if you must.

00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:25.211 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL]
That won't be enough!

00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:26.963 position:50% align:center
What did you expect
me to do, Belial?!

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:29.924 position:50% align:center
Unlike you bimbos with your
ridiculous porn star bodies,

--I had to get creative!
--Watch it.

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:34.804 position:50% align:center
For a girl like me, gaining
popularity isn't as simple

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:37.015 position:50% align:center
as showing off
my jiggly-bits to everyone!

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:38.099 position:50% align:center
--[ASTAROTH] Seriously?!
--[BELIAL snarls]

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:39.684 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
Oh, right.

00:17:39.768 --> 00:17:41.936 position:50% align:center
It's my fault for filming you,
is that what you're thinking?

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.481 position:50% align:center
Well, I hope you don't expect
an apology because evil leaders

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:45.982 position:50% align:center
are meant to be evil!

00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:47.233 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
Ahn!

00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:49.402 position:50% align:center
[LILITH] Guess who just
earned evil points?! Me!

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:50.820 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL]
Ah-Ahh!

00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:52.489 position:50% align:center
[LILITH] Now guess who's
earning more evil points?! Me!

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center
[AGENT 10F] So Lilith's
our most popular leader?

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.576 position:50% align:center
[AGENT 10E]
Well, did you vote for her?

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:58.453 position:50% align:center
[AGENT 10F]
Of course I didn't. No way.

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:01.247 position:50% align:center
Mama didn't raise no perv.

00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:02.832 position:50% align:center
[ATTENDEES gasping]

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.294 position:50% align:center
[murmuring, gasping]

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:09.255 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL] Sure. Just hand out
small-dollar Kisaragi gift cards

00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:11.841 position:50% align:center
to the people she hired. Doable?

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:14.469 position:50% align:center
Lilith can go into debt
to pay for it. Yeah.

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:16.930 position:50% align:center
Say we screwed up
some paperwork.

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:18.973 position:50% align:center
But first, go and delete
the video she put up

00:18:19.057 --> 00:18:20.892 position:50% align:center
on NicoTube, got it?

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:23.186 position:50% align:center
[LILITH groaning]

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.188 position:50% align:center
So, um...

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:28.525 position:50% align:center
Listen: The survey doesn't
really mean anything to me,

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.485 position:50% align:center
but I'm still a little curious.

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.904 position:50% align:center
At least in regards to
how some people voted.

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
Hah? Ya lost me.

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:38.743 position:50% align:center
I mean considering our history,
there's really no need to ask.

00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:40.829 position:50% align:center
The answer's all but assumed.

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:43.998 position:50% align:center
Yet I still feel
compelled to ask.

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:46.835 position:50% align:center
I suppose I just want to hear
the words said out loud.

00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:49.170 position:50% align:center
So here goes.

00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
Would you mind telling me
who you voted for, Six?

00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:53.216 position:50% align:center
Sure, I'm not shy.

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:54.759 position:50% align:center

I feel a bit shy.

The timing is a little
suspicious, don't you think?!

know that we're having a party,

let alone that we're
having it on top of this hotel.

00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:20.493 position:50% align:center
But they do, because
a certain self-proclaimed genius

it to the entire world.

want to know who you voted for.

Don't say stuff like that.

of these grasshopper heroes?

My mutants are demonstrably
stronger in every blasted way!

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:08.750 position:50% align:center
I will now atone for my earlier

Hey, Astaroth! Wait a second!

00:22:31.601 --> 00:22:32.644 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:22:32.727 --> 00:22:33.937 position:50% align:center
That was a moving
speech and all,

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.355 position:50% align:center
but if you really
want us to win,

00:22:35.438 --> 00:22:37.982 position:50% align:center
then you should give me
an advance on my evil points!

00:22:38.066 --> 00:22:40.819 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna need some weapons
to be ready tomorrow!

00:22:40.902 --> 00:22:42.320 position:50% align:center
Looks like she's gonna
have her paws full

00:22:42.404 --> 00:22:44.072 position:50% align:center
with those heroes for a while.

00:22:44.155 --> 00:22:45.990 position:50% align:center
Think you'd better
give it up for tonight.

00:22:46.074 --> 00:22:47.617 position:50% align:center
If you're that worried,
talk to Alice.

00:22:47.701 --> 00:22:49.869 position:50% align:center
I'm sure she can help out
in a pinch, meow.

00:22:49.953 --> 00:22:53.998 position:50% align:center
I sure can. My processor's
very fast, so trust me.

00:22:54.082 --> 00:22:55.375 position:50% align:center
I have a plan that
should neutralize

00:22:55.458 --> 00:22:56.751 position:50% align:center
the Demon Lord's army.

00:22:56.835 --> 00:22:59.546 position:50% align:center
Really, meow?! That's amazing
Ny-Alice, way to go!

00:22:59.629 --> 00:23:02.007 position:50% align:center
Your purrcessor
must be crazy fast!

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:05.135 position:50% align:center
Well, yes, I am a high-spec
android, after all.

00:23:05.218 --> 00:23:07.887 position:50% align:center
We'll have to wake early
tomorrow, so get some sleep.

00:23:07.971 --> 00:23:10.056 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Right! I'll do that.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.641 position:50% align:center
Have a good night!

00:23:14.811 --> 00:23:16.688 position:50% align:center
I thought you could help,
but I didn't expect you to have

00:23:16.771 --> 00:23:18.440 position:50% align:center
a whole plan worked out.

00:23:18.523 --> 00:23:21.109 position:50% align:center
You're a real fur-middable
android, meow.

00:23:21.192 --> 00:23:23.820 position:50% align:center
I was the one who requested
that Kisaragi prohibit Six

00:23:23.903 --> 00:23:25.447 position:50% align:center
from going into the red.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:28.241 position:50% align:center
If I hadn't, he'd dip so far
into negative evil points

00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:29.617 position:50% align:center
that he'd lose
what chance he had

00:23:29.701 --> 00:23:31.536 position:50% align:center
of getting back to Earth.

00:23:33.121 --> 00:23:35.331 position:50% align:center
When it looks like all is lost,
I'll request that the feature

00:23:35.415 --> 00:23:37.959 position:50% align:center
be re-enabled,
and I'll tell him he owes me

00:23:38.043 --> 00:23:39.377 position:50% align:center
big time for it.

00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:40.545 position:50% align:center
Oh my.

00:23:40.628 --> 00:23:44.466 position:50% align:center
Um. Wow.
That is none of my business.

00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:46.426 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, who's that over there?!

00:23:46.509 --> 00:23:49.679 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I can totally come...
hang out there, that's not here.
