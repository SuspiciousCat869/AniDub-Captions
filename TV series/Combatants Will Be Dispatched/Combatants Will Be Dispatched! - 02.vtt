[TRAINEES grunting]

00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:45.188 position:50% align:center
Gotcha now!

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.731 position:50% align:center
You fiend!

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:48.066 position:50% align:center
[ARCHER 2A grunts]

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.150 position:50% align:center
Hmph!

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:53.029 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Seems to be only
old men and young women.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:55.323 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] Sadly, we lost most
of the young men in our war

00:01:55.407 --> 00:01:56.616 position:50% align:center
with the demons.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.910 position:50% align:center
So, um... Alice.

00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:01.079 position:50% align:center
Are you really
joining Six's unit?

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:04.374 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I'm high-spec,
which means I can do anything.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:07.127 position:50% align:center
So whatever you'd have
a strategist and a medic do,

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.461 position:50% align:center
I'll handle them both.

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:10.463 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
Well, in any case,

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:12.757 position:50% align:center
here are the applicants' forms,
which I guess you're free

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:13.758 position:50% align:center
to look over.

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:14.759 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
You guess?

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:16.261 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
You're new.

00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:17.762 position:50% align:center
You didn't even know we were
at war earlier today, so...

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:20.515 position:50% align:center
I can take care of
assembling our team.

00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:21.933 position:50% align:center
Gather round!

00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:24.310 position:50% align:center
If we call your name,
that means you're on the unit.

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:28.398 position:50% align:center
Hey, Six, got any input?

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:31.818 position:50% align:center
Just that I'm digging this "War
God Alexandrite Gleamnail" guy.

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:33.194 position:50% align:center
That's a baller name.

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:35.280 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
No. That geezer's over 80.

00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:37.699 position:50% align:center
Input on these two,
specifically.

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:39.159 position:50% align:center
They've both got
much higher kill counts

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:41.202 position:50% align:center
than anyone else on the list.

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:43.288 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] Okay, we're only
gonna call two of you.

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:45.457 position:50% align:center
First is-- Guh!
What now?

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.543 position:50% align:center
Listen, I want you to add
these two to the roster, got it?

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:50.503 position:50% align:center
Uh, who are you talking about?

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:52.881 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Just call out
these names, like I asked.

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:55.467 position:50% align:center
[SNOW groans]
Hey, Rose!

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.135 position:50% align:center
I am known as Rose.

00:02:57.218 --> 00:03:00.930 position:50% align:center
Yes, the artificial
combat chimera, Rose.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:02.307 position:50% align:center
Ask yourself:

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.768 position:50% align:center
Are you truly man
enough to handle me?

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:07.187 position:50% align:center
I am the one who's
known as Agent Six.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.564 position:50% align:center
Yes, a cybernetic
fighting machine perfected

00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:13.443 position:50% align:center
through modifications, at the
cost of his past and true name.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:17.197 position:50% align:center
Welcome to the team,
artificial combat chimera, Rose.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.824 position:50% align:center
And I am known
as Alice Kisaragi,

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:21.701 position:50% align:center
an android with the capacity
to deal with even

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.620 position:50% align:center
the cringey-est
nutbags like you.

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:24.704 position:50% align:center
So don't worry.

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:26.498 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
Oh, uh, thanks for that!

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:28.541 position:50% align:center
So, yeah, when
my grandpa made me,

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.670 position:50% align:center
he told me I should
introduce myself that way.

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:34.547 position:50% align:center
Uh, and those were
his very last words.

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:36.007 position:50% align:center
Says here if you eat something,

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:37.634 position:50% align:center
you can absorb
its special powers?

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:38.885 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
Yeah, that's right!

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:40.845 position:50% align:center
I gotta eat alotta meat
for it to really work,

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:42.639 position:50% align:center
but whenever I eat
a Demon Beast, I take on

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.224 position:50% align:center
whatever ability they had!

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:45.558 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Oh, cool.

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.143 position:50% align:center
[ROSE] Lately, I've had
the chance to much on some

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:50.230 position:50% align:center
pretty strong demon beasts, like
fire-spitting flameburst lizards

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:51.815 position:50% align:center
and a few one-horned ogres!

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.651 position:50% align:center
That's the reason I've got this
tail and tiny horn right now.

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:58.780 position:50% align:center
Sniff-sniff. Ah! I smell
something really yummy!

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:01.199 position:50% align:center
--Uh. Oh. I bet you mean this.
--[ROSE] Sniff-sniff...

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:02.826 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Everyone's favorite
nutritionally-balanced,

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.078 position:50% align:center
pre-packaged meal, Calorie Z.

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:08.206 position:50% align:center
Now, I'm probably willing to
consider sharing it with you,

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:10.208 position:50% align:center
but you have to do whatever
I say, you hear me?

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:11.918 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
Seriously?!

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:15.088 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Okay. So that's how
we're going to proceed with her.

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:16.589 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Next... is Grimm!

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:18.133 position:50% align:center
Come up here.

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.804 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Hmm.

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:24.848 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM]
Pleasure to meet you.

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.516 position:50% align:center
My name is Grimm.

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.351 position:50% align:center
So, Mister Commander, sir.

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:30.770 position:50% align:center
Let me ask you
the most burning question.

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center
Go on.

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:33.898 position:50% align:center
If you're single, of course.

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:35.692 position:50% align:center
You married?
Have a girlfriend?

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:38.236 position:50% align:center
I am currently single,
by the way.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.947 position:50% align:center
I know it's hard to believe,
but for some reason,

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.532 position:50% align:center
I can't find a man.

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:44.034 position:50% align:center
I'm single now, too.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:47.037 position:50% align:center
Although I am the perfect
handsome and sweet package,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.913 position:50% align:center
nobody's snatched
this thing up, yet.

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:50.623 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM]
Well, isn't that a coincidence?

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:51.833 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
What are you two talking about?!

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:53.710 position:50% align:center
Absolutely no fraternizing,
you understand?!

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.712 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:57.797 position:50% align:center
So it says here your
some kinda "witch"?

00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:00.258 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM gasps] Why are you
staring at me like that?!

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:03.428 position:50% align:center
Technically speaking, no,
I'm not a "witch," per se.

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:04.971 position:50% align:center
I'm something more
like a conduit for

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:06.848 position:50% align:center
the great Zenarith's power.

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:09.142 position:50% align:center
I can perform miracles
on his behalf.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:10.518 position:50% align:center
[ALICE, SIX]
Hmm...

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:12.854 position:50% align:center
You're gonna have to fill me
in on this "Zenarith."

00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:15.106 position:50% align:center
The God of Undeath and Disaster.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.441 position:50% align:center
Who I serve.

00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:19.027 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Sounds gnarly. So he's evil?

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.404 position:50% align:center
You shall be cursed
for your rudeness!

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:24.783 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
Tell me, boy.

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:27.452 position:50% align:center
You wanna see what's goin' on
under Miss Grimm's skirt,

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:28.787 position:50% align:center
don't you?

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.955 position:50% align:center
All you gotta do is beg
forgiveness and repent

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.957 position:50% align:center
for your blasphemy
against Lord Zenarith,

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:34.334 position:50% align:center
and I'll baptize
you in the name of--

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:36.211 position:50% align:center
--[SIX] Flip.
--[GRIMM] Ahh!

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:38.380 position:50% align:center
[VOICE 1A]
You earned Evil Points!

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:40.507 position:50% align:center
Wow, so you got a little
naughty side, don't ya?

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.259 position:50% align:center
I wasn't gonna actually let you
take a peek at my maidenhood!

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.970 position:50% align:center
Hey. You'll take
responsibility, won't you?

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:48.264 position:50% align:center
You'd better put a ring on it
and make me your wife!

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.642 position:50% align:center
Because after what you've seen,
I can't just let you go!

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:52.268 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Uh-oh, we got a clinger!

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.812 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM]
What?!

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Oh, you'd better slow your
roll there, Lady Butt-Floss.

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.357 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM]
Don't call me that!

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.609 position:50% align:center
It's all because I read
an article in Piyoko Club

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:01.152 position:50% align:center
that said wearing this
underwear would help me...

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:04.531 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I should've known you'd
pick the biggest headaches.

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:06.032 position:50% align:center
I'll do what I can
with this team,

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
but we won't be together long.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.327 position:50% align:center
I need to take command.

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.287 position:50% align:center
We'll win quickly
if I'm in charge.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:14.416 position:50% align:center
Since Princess Tillis trusts me,
I'll get my rank back,

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:17.043 position:50% align:center
and we can all just go on with
our lives without each other.

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:18.878 position:50% align:center
I'm the one calling
the shots, moron.

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:20.213 position:50% align:center
[snarls]

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:22.048 position:50% align:center
You just got demoted,
didja forget that already?

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:23.550 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
That is not true!

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:25.719 position:50% align:center
And plus, taking orders
from a stupid man

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:28.221 position:50% align:center
in an evil looking outfit and
a nasty gleam in his eyes

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:29.723 position:50% align:center
would be a blow
to my honor!

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:31.141 position:50% align:center
Uh! Say what?

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:32.225 position:50% align:center
Am I wrong?

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:34.185 position:50% align:center
You strike me as
having no education.

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:35.603 position:50% align:center
While I, on the other hand,

00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center
graduated from the kingdom's
finest university!

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.316 position:50% align:center
[SIX grunts] I never even
finished high school!

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.153 position:50% align:center
Promise that you'll follow
my orders to the letter,

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.697 position:50% align:center
and you won't just embarrass
yourself out on the battlefield.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.823 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:49.576 position:50% align:center
Oh, resorting to violence?

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.995 position:50% align:center
Go on. If you really
have the stones to hit me,

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.705 position:50% align:center
then do your worst, 'kay?

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:56.249 position:50% align:center
Don't let the fact that I'm
a woman be your excuse.

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:58.501 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Worst, coming at ya!

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:00.462 position:50% align:center

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:02.088 position:50% align:center

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:05.633 position:50% align:center
[VOICE 1A]
You earned Evil Points!

[SNOW gasps, whimpers]

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:10.347 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Whoops! My bad!
Now, don't go crazy!

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.931 position:50% align:center
--I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
--[SIX] Whoa!

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:13.516 position:50% align:center
--I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
--I really struck a nerve there!

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.894 position:50% align:center
--I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
--Hey! Watch out for the face!

00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:18.063 position:50% align:center
Is something the matter, Snow?

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:19.606 position:50% align:center
Uh, Tillis?

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:22.484 position:50% align:center
So. Gonna act like a homicidal
maniac around the Princess?

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:28.073 position:50% align:center
[snarls] You'd better
watch your six, Six.

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
I knew grabbing her grapes
would piss her off,

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:31.993 position:50% align:center
but I didn't think she'd
really try to murder me.

00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:33.161 position:50% align:center
[ALICE growls]

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:35.955 position:50% align:center
Agent Six? Why would you
behave so crassly?

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:38.375 position:50% align:center
Snow is a very serious woman.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.418 position:50% align:center
She began life as
an orphan in the slums,

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:42.671 position:50% align:center
and became a knight in the
royal guard through hard work

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:44.255 position:50% align:center
and determination.

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.217 position:50% align:center
Yeah? I figured she was just
some rich guy's daughter.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.885 position:50% align:center
Anyway, what brings
you out here today?

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.553 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS chuckles]
Actually,

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:53.306 position:50% align:center
it's concerning your
sleeping arrangements.

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:57.686 position:50% align:center
Meh. This is fine.

00:07:57.769 --> 00:08:00.230 position:50% align:center
Besides, it's probably better
for coordinating our mission

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:02.107 position:50% align:center
if we're in the same room.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.860 position:50% align:center
Look, don't get any weird ideas
just because I'm a pretty girl.

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:09.155 position:50% align:center
I don't even have reproductive
organs, so you'd be outta luck.

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:12.534 position:50% align:center
You're a little kid robot,
so, eww!

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:14.786 position:50% align:center
It doesn't appear
to be electric.

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:17.539 position:50% align:center
Their tech may be more advanced
than I'd first thought.

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:21.042 position:50% align:center
Between this and the artifacts,
we have our work cut out for us.

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:23.420 position:50% align:center
Hey. It'll all be
fine, won't it?

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.547 position:50% align:center
If we can pull out a big win
right off the bat,

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.924 position:50% align:center
maybe we'll get a sweet
hideout as a reward!

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:30.385 position:50% align:center
Well, I am somewhat relieved
and surprised you remember

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:32.971 position:50% align:center
our original mission.
Although...

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:35.724 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't take
the situation too lightly.

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:42.355 position:50% align:center
So bright...

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:45.400 position:50% align:center
Can't we just blow it up,
and be done with it?

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:48.069 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Hmm... They're walking
straight into the enemy

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:50.655 position:50% align:center
like lemmings. Do you have
a toddler in charge

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:53.158 position:50% align:center
of your military
strategy or what?

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:56.494 position:50% align:center
Facing powerful enemies head on
is how you achieve glory.

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:59.080 position:50% align:center
I don't quite understand
what we're even doing up here.

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:01.082 position:50% align:center
[SIX] We're gonna crush
their supply line.

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:02.792 position:50% align:center
But that's the coward's way!

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:05.086 position:50% align:center
Supply units are all
lower-ranking demons.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.297 position:50% align:center
Defeating them
won't bring you any glory!

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.673 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
It's like this, Snow.

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:11.384 position:50% align:center
We're up against a powerful
Demon Lord and his army.

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:13.636 position:50% align:center
If we cut their supplies,
they'll have to retreat.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.056 position:50% align:center
Losing this small, single unit
could effectively cripple

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:17.098 position:50% align:center
the enemy.

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:19.392 position:50% align:center
I understand your logic,
but still...

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:21.978 position:50% align:center
Just swallow your pride and
listen to the kid, would ya?

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:23.021 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
Commander!

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:25.148 position:50% align:center
I want to fight
strong enemies, too!

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:27.609 position:50% align:center
My Grandpa's dying wish was
that I eat every last demon

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:31.071 position:50% align:center
in the world, and then I can
become the ultimate chimera!

00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:34.115 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
Your Grandpa's dying wish...

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:36.701 position:50% align:center
I'd really love to help
you honor that, okay?

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:38.286 position:50% align:center
Oh, let me eat all of 'em,

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.914 position:50% align:center
because I know this fresh meat
will be so yummy for my tummy!

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:43.208 position:50% align:center
But playing a game of hungry,
hungry chimera might be

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50% align:center
a good deed, so...

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:48.004 position:50% align:center
Rose, you can do what you want
with their provisions.

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:50.382 position:50% align:center
[ROSE] Let's end their lives
and eat all their food!

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:53.259 position:50% align:center
Hold on! I think we should
hit their base camp.

00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:56.513 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I kinda need
to max out on glory.

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:59.474 position:50% align:center
Because this demotion
decimated my salary.

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:02.060 position:50% align:center
And if I can't afford to keep
up with the payments on my

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:05.146 position:50% align:center
beloved Flame Zapper
sword, it's gonna get repoed!

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.481 position:50% align:center
[sobs]

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:09.401 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Agent Six can
help you with your glory.

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:11.736 position:50% align:center
He's a master of inflating
his accomplishments.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.656 position:50% align:center
I can tell just
by looking at him.

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:16.408 position:50% align:center
You want my hands to slip again?

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:19.369 position:50% align:center
--[thud]

Woo-hoo!

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:29.295 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
You shall not pass!

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:31.506 position:50% align:center
Gwah!

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:33.049 position:50% align:center
The enemy!

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:36.261 position:50% align:center
[ORCS grunting, groaning]

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:40.682 position:50% align:center
If you value your lives,
drop the goods and scram.

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center
Yeah, am-scray!

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.645 position:50% align:center
[laughs maniacally]

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:47.939 position:50% align:center
So either get lost,
or we'll murder ya!

00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:49.816 position:50% align:center
[ORCS whimpering]

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.818 position:50% align:center
Commander, I know we're
trying to scare them,

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.570 position:50% align:center
but all that stuff you said
makes it sound like

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:54.904 position:50% align:center
we're the baddies here.

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:56.781 position:50% align:center
Relax, we're following
the guidelines written in

00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:59.284 position:50% align:center
the Kisaragi Corporation's
combat manual,

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:00.702 position:50% align:center
word for word.

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:03.121 position:50% align:center
[ROSE] Combat Manual?
What are you talking about?

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.790 position:50% align:center
Hey, listen. Grab whatever crap
you want outta there

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:09.169 position:50% align:center
and burn the rest, would ya?
Just go hog-wild, okay?

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:11.129 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
Wow! You're the best, Commander!

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.631 position:50% align:center
Let's strike fear into the
hearts of the Demon Lord's army,

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:15.300 position:50% align:center
or wherever they
feel that stuff!

00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:19.220 position:50% align:center
Sink into my endless sea
of crimson and sleep forever.

You do you, I guess, but I
draw the line at eating things

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.274 position:50% align:center
that can talk.

[BOTH]
A gryphon!

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:39.657 position:50% align:center
Well, well.
What do we have here?

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:46.623 position:50% align:center
You with that ridiculous armor.

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:49.000 position:50% align:center

you're in charge?

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:54.631 position:50% align:center
Tell me... What are you doing?

[SIX] Your look and
your vibe are so fierce.

00:11:57.217 --> 00:12:00.261 position:50% align:center
I see. You're a
leader-class demon.

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:01.805 position:50% align:center
[HEINE]
Indeed!

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:04.015 position:50% align:center
I am Heine of the Flame, one of
the Demon Lord's Elite Four!

00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:05.558 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Now, that's an angle...

00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:08.103 position:50% align:center
So you're saying you
can sense my power.

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:10.146 position:50% align:center
Not bad for a human.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.982 position:50% align:center
That was a ruthless attack
on our supply convoy.

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:15.777 position:50% align:center
I don't imagine you have
a trace of chivalry.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.780 position:50% align:center
Striking you down seems like
a real shame, to me.

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:21.991 position:50% align:center
So if you leave behind
the supplies, I'll let you live.

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:24.327 position:50% align:center
What do you think about
callin' it a day here, Alice?

'Coz I'm not so sure we can
handle this mutant babe.

And now I'm beginning to
understand the reason why

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:30.917 position:50% align:center
you never got promoted.

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:34.379 position:50% align:center
[laughs] There's a place in
Demon Lord's army for a guy

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:36.131 position:50% align:center
who doesn't beat
around the bush.

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:37.841 position:50% align:center
I can put you in charge
of the other humans

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:39.551 position:50% align:center
that are working for us.

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:42.804 position:50% align:center
As a bonus, you can make
any woman your slave.

as joining them?!

give up my dinner like that!

Sorry, lady.

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:55.108 position:50% align:center
But I've already got a scary
boss who's into skanky cosplay.

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.277 position:50% align:center
No surprise. I had a feeling.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.529 position:50% align:center
I could tell you're the type
who likes to talk a big game,

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.656 position:50% align:center
but still pitifully loyal.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.783 position:50% align:center
You mind telling me
what your name is?

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:05.827 position:50% align:center
I'm Combat Agent Six.

the Flame, and the Elite Four!

[gasps] Yeah, okay then, Six.
Here we go.

but you're outnumbered!

the wrong element to fight her!

supplies, though.

I guess I'll just burn up
all the stuff that I was

gonna take back home!

Ugh. Alice!

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:39.778 position:50% align:center

I can't tell--
smells like a golem.

Hey, Six, it's too late for her.

She's already dead.

I don't know much about her

besides her choice
in underwear.

Right!

Yeah, okay.

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:12.555 position:50% align:center
Right! Will do!

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:14.391 position:50% align:center
Well, you got serious
all of a sudden.

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:17.102 position:50% align:center
You humans barely live,
but you're that eager to die?

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:19.729 position:50% align:center
Gadalkand, you need to
come back immediately!

00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:20.939 position:50% align:center
What for?!

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:22.399 position:50% align:center
Because If you show up
late to the battle,

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.442 position:50% align:center
Russell of the Water will be
putting our clan's heads

00:16:24.526 --> 00:16:26.569 position:50% align:center
on the chopping block!

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:28.697 position:50% align:center
You got lucky this time, human.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.241 position:50% align:center
You're gonna run away,
you ugly piece of crap?!

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:32.325 position:50% align:center
Buh-bye

00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:34.077 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Wait! Come back here!

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.579 position:50% align:center
Damn it!

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:38.373 position:50% align:center
Alice. R-Buzzsaw?

00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:39.916 position:50% align:center
Once it was obvious
he was leaving,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.918 position:50% align:center
I decided not to send for it.

00:16:43.378 --> 00:16:45.213 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:16:45.296 --> 00:16:47.465 position:50% align:center
Let's have a funeral for Grimm.

00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:50.552 position:50% align:center
And I have a feeling we'll see
that ugly-club-demon again.

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:51.886 position:50% align:center
--[ROSE] Uh?
--You do realize something

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.556 position:50% align:center
like that wouldn't really
kill Grimm, don't you?

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.349 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:16:56.433 --> 00:17:00.770 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] You can probably tell,
but Rose has demon blood in her.

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:03.273 position:50% align:center
And because of that,
people feared her

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:05.567 position:50% align:center
and treated her like garbage.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.819 position:50% align:center
Made her take on
enemy units alone.

00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:09.320 position:50% align:center
Things like that.

00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:11.531 position:50% align:center
Well, that does explain why
her kill count was so high.

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:14.617 position:50% align:center
Kinda crazy. It seems like
this place has so many scumbags

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:16.619 position:50% align:center
running around,
I don't look so bad.

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:18.038 position:50% align:center
Least in comparison.

00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:20.957 position:50% align:center
That's right. There are a lot
of scumbags out there--

00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:23.251 position:50% align:center
you've got some
stiff competition.

00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:25.754 position:50% align:center
And Grimm was treated
poorly as well.

00:17:25.837 --> 00:17:28.298 position:50% align:center
They see her as expendable
in a different way.

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.383 position:50% align:center
Since she's an archpriest
of Zenarith.

00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:33.970 position:50% align:center
She'll come back to life no
matter how many times she dies.

00:17:37.432 --> 00:17:40.143 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Looks like they got
spanked hard out there.

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:44.189 position:50% align:center
[SNOW laughs] Now the top brass
are gonna owe us big time.

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
C'mon, Snow!

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:49.235 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know. First,
we'll take her to the temple.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.574 position:50% align:center
[SIX] So this is really gonna
bring her back to life or what?

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:56.743 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] Yeah. All we do
is put her on the altar

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:59.913 position:50% align:center
with an offering and Zenarith
will take it from there.

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:02.999 position:50% align:center
She'll probably be back
to life before nightfall.

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:05.460 position:50% align:center
[SIX] And by "offering,"
you mean that crap around her?

00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:08.463 position:50% align:center
With Zenarith's offerings, it's
more about someone's attachment

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:11.383 position:50% align:center
to the object and not
the monetary value.

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:12.967 position:50% align:center
This'll be enough.

00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:16.096 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna head to my room and
catch that knife documentary.

00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:19.057 position:50% align:center
I think I'll go and give
this thing a good cleaning.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.684 position:50% align:center
What about you, Six?

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:24.521 position:50% align:center
Uh, me? I'm gonna hang around
here and check it out.

00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:35.073 position:50% align:center
[SIX sighs]

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:38.201 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Uh?

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:39.536 position:50% align:center

Commander...?

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:50.046 position:50% align:center
I'm a bit surprised
to see you here.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.841 position:50% align:center
Well, I just thought I should
wait for you to un-die.

00:18:52.924 --> 00:18:54.801 position:50% align:center
How come?
[gasps]

00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:56.678 position:50% align:center
It's so you can punish me
because I died without

00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:59.347 position:50% align:center
using my powers or really
doing anything at all!

00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:00.890 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
No, no.

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:02.809 position:50% align:center
I just thought it would suck to
die and have no one show up

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:05.478 position:50% align:center
when you came back to life.

00:19:05.562 --> 00:19:07.689 position:50% align:center
You're a strange one, Commander.

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:09.065 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:11.776 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM] Nobody's ever
been this nice to me.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.488 position:50% align:center
Most normal people
think I'm kinda creepy.

00:19:15.572 --> 00:19:17.866 position:50% align:center
That's like the only bit of
praise I've gotten from anyone

00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:20.201 position:50% align:center
since I came to
this crazy place.

00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:23.830 position:50% align:center
Well, I think you deserve it.
What's more, Commander,

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:25.999 position:50% align:center
if I may be so forward,

00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:27.709 position:50% align:center
would you like to go on
a date with me?

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:29.544 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Hmm?!

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:30.962 position:50% align:center
Ya-hoo!

00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:33.256 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM] Wow, Commander,
this new wheelchair is amazing!

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.717 position:50% align:center
But I'm afraid it may have
spoiled the old one for me!

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.720 position:50% align:center
[SIX] They might be evil,
but Kisaragi's got cool toys!

00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:40.805 position:50% align:center
Now you're the fastest
girl in the land!

00:19:40.889 --> 00:19:42.724 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM] You may have noticed,
but Rose and I are different

00:19:42.807 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
from the other troops,
so we get sent on

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.936 position:50% align:center
all the riskiest missions in
order to get rid of us.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.022 position:50% align:center
It's fine I suppose, because
we're the hardest to kill,

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:50.482 position:50% align:center
so we always come back!

00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:51.900 position:50% align:center
But if you want my opinion,

00:19:51.983 --> 00:19:53.193 position:50% align:center
you and Alice
should quit the army

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:55.153 position:50% align:center
and leave the kingdom entirely.

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:57.322 position:50% align:center
What?! I'm not going anywhere!

00:19:57.405 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
This unit's just me
and a bunch of chicks!

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.743 position:50% align:center
I've got my own little
harem sitch going on,

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:03.411 position:50% align:center
you couldn't make me
quit if you tried!

00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:05.288 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM laughs]
In that case,

00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:08.625 position:50% align:center
we're glad to have you
with us, Commander.

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:10.377 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I worried you.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.504 position:50% align:center

you're finally back!

Hey, what's your problem?!

00:20:38.613 --> 00:20:40.115 position:50% align:center
Are you really terrorizing
the city because

00:20:40.198 --> 00:20:41.574 position:50% align:center
you can't find a man?!

[GRIMM] You're going to be
eating those words, sister!

O, great Lord Zenarith, hear me!
Unleash a horrifying dizzy spell

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:49.124 position:50% align:center
on this heathen!

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.212 position:50% align:center
Curses don't work 100%
of the time, you know.

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:56.589 position:50% align:center
I'd say my success rate
is around 80.

00:20:56.673 --> 00:20:58.299 position:50% align:center
But that drops if I use
the same phrasing,

00:20:58.383 --> 00:21:01.886 position:50% align:center
because, apparently, Zenarith
isn't a fan of repetition.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.097 position:50% align:center
They all require
an appropriate offering,

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.182 position:50% align:center
and a price must be
paid if the curse fails.

00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:09.602 position:50% align:center
It falls back on me, and I must
sacrifice something in return.

00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:11.896 position:50% align:center
Like this.
What happened to me.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.232 position:50% align:center
So the reason you're in a
wheelchair is because you were

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:15.984 position:50% align:center
hit with a failed curse
that made your legs

00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:18.903 position:50% align:center
not work anymore
or something?

00:21:18.987 --> 00:21:20.447 position:50% align:center
In a way...

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.824 position:50% align:center
...this awful curse now prevents
me from ever wearing shoes.

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:23.825 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:26.036 position:50% align:center
Wow, your power
is kinda pathetic.

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.328 position:50% align:center
Is that so...?

00:21:27.412 --> 00:21:28.705 position:50% align:center
Then I'll simply have
to demonstrate

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.540 position:50% align:center
what real power looks like!

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:33.501 position:50% align:center
Lord Zenarith, bring your curse
upon this girl who claims

00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:34.919 position:50% align:center
to have a boyfriend!

00:21:35.003 --> 00:21:36.838 position:50% align:center
Feel the kind of pain you feel
when you stub your toe

00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:38.048 position:50% align:center
on the dresser!
