00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:14.264 position:50% align:center
[SIX] You really called me in at
the crack of dawn on my day off?

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:16.599 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] Six, being rude to
the general won't help anyone!

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:19.227 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL 3A] It's fine.
But this is an emergency.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.813 position:50% align:center
The treasure acquired in Duster
Tower has cleared the way

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:23.398 position:50% align:center
for the Chosen One.

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:27.360 position:50% align:center
His party can move forward and
engage the Demon Lord in battle.

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:28.820 position:50% align:center
However...

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:30.196 position:50% align:center
There's trouble.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.033 position:50% align:center
Heine of the Flame is attacking
our vanguard squadron.

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.285 position:50% align:center
The enemy is getting desperate.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:38.621 position:50% align:center
So we'll be asking your unit
to handle the their top leaders.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.207 position:50% align:center
Take them out.
Starting with the Elite Four.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:42.292 position:50% align:center
With pleasure, sir!

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.294 position:50% align:center
Hey, pump the brakes
there, would ya?

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.796 position:50% align:center
You're not seriously considering
refusing the request?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.798 position:50% align:center
This mission is a huge honor!

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:52.469 position:50% align:center
And if we pull it off, we'd
practically be swimming in gold!

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:53.928 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.430 position:50% align:center
Please, Sir Six.

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:57.724 position:50% align:center
The success of this mission
is of the utmost importance,

00:00:57.807 --> 00:00:59.351 position:50% align:center
and therefore,
can only be entrusted to

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:01.102 position:50% align:center
a national hero like you.

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:04.856 position:50% align:center
I implore you accept, for the
good of all the people of Grace.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.858 position:50% align:center
Ah, so you're the one who
decided we should do

00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:10.070 position:50% align:center
this uber important,
last minute, dangerous gig.

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:12.655 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL 3A] Yes. As you heard,
the Chief of Staff thinks

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.325 position:50% align:center
rather highly of you
and your unit.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:16.868 position:50% align:center
[SIX groans]

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:19.037 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF OF STAFF chuckles]

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:56.009 position:50% align:center
Listen! Let me remind you that
failure is not an option!

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:57.802 position:50% align:center
We're here to win,
and nothing less!

00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:59.679 position:50% align:center
--[SOLDIERS cheering]
--Will do!

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:01.222 position:50% align:center
--[SNOW] Grimm, wake up!
--So Alice...

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:03.058 position:50% align:center
What's your take on the sitch?

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:04.642 position:50% align:center
By that, you mean...

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:07.020 position:50% align:center
My thoughts on this suicide
mission they forced on us?

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:09.356 position:50% align:center
Bingo. I'm guessing the guy
doesn't like me because

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.483 position:50% align:center
I made him look like
a total dumbass in front of the

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:12.984 position:50% align:center
--other generals or whatever.
--[SNOW] Grimm, you gotta 

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:14.527 position:50% align:center
wake up before the battle starts
and you get killed again!

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:15.737 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM yelps]

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.863 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Ahh!

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:18.823 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM groans]

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:20.617 position:50% align:center
If that's what happened,
I think it would give him

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.161 position:50% align:center
enough motivation
to hate you, Agent Six.

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:26.456 position:50% align:center
But... remember this whole
squad is full of misfits.

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.833 position:50% align:center
Personal business aside,
if Heine shows up,

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:30.752 position:50% align:center
we pretend to fight
and then pull back.

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:33.922 position:50% align:center
I'm having some maintenance done
on the shotgun, so I'm unarmed.

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:35.173 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay.

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:37.884 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] Uh, just get her
back in her wheelchair.

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:40.095 position:50% align:center
--Upsy-daisy...
--[SIX] What're you doing?

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:41.846 position:50% align:center
Oh, just some
girl talk, ya know?

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.306 position:50% align:center
That's all!

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.892 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Hmm. Anyway,
here's the deal:

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:48.436 position:50% align:center
we won't actually do any
fighting today, you got that?

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.272 position:50% align:center
Ah... What do you mean,
we're not fighting?!

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:54.442 position:50% align:center
This is a special mission given
to us by the upper echelon!

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:57.904 position:50% align:center
I know, but I can't freakin'
stand that bald, one-eyed guy.

00:03:57.987 --> 00:04:00.699 position:50% align:center
He just comes off like a petty,
sneaky, small-time villain.

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:03.201 position:50% align:center
Someone who only cares
about his own survival.

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:04.411 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:06.121 position:50% align:center
Because I think you
just described yourself!

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:09.374 position:50% align:center
Agent Six. You have heard
of a mirror, haven't you?

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:12.085 position:50% align:center
Commander, or have you
heard of a "boomerang"?

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:13.628 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM groans]

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:16.881 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Hmph. Real nice. You hags
are just as hateable as he is.

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:18.508 position:50% align:center

[SOLDIERS murmuring, gasping]

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.581 position:50% align:center
What the hell is that?

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.332 position:50% align:center
So they brought along a golem?

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:54.252 position:50% align:center
A stone creature
powered by magic.

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:58.173 position:50% align:center
It's quite fascinating.
Magic can do many things.

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:00.091 position:50% align:center
Hmm? Look at them.

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50% align:center
They're splitting up
their forces.

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:05.263 position:50% align:center
Hey, uh, our unit is supposed to
concentrate on fighting Heine,

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:06.848 position:50% align:center
isn't that right?

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:09.517 position:50% align:center
Brave Sir Six, you can leave the
high orcs to me and my squadron!

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:12.645 position:50% align:center

down all the powerful ogres!

Uh. Wait a sec, I--

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.482 position:50% align:center
Not to worry, sir,
they're tough,

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:16.983 position:50% align:center
but our troops are tougher!

00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:18.276 position:50% align:center
Go!

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:24.866 position:50% align:center
Hey, Snow, did ya
wake Grimm up, or what?

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.869 position:50% align:center
We'll get her to put
a super gnarly curse on Heine!

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:31.873 position:50% align:center
Y-Yeah... Somebody else can
get her out of dreamland.

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:33.750 position:50% align:center
I just took out a three-year
loan to pay for

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.293 position:50% align:center
the beautiful
Glacial Blade, Iceberg,

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:39.047 position:50% align:center

It's perfect to slay Heine!

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:46.680 position:50% align:center
Can I please go and take
a bite out of that gryphon?

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:48.014 position:50% align:center
I've always wanted to fly,

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:50.392 position:50% align:center
and I think a nibble on him
might do the trick.

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.394 position:50% align:center
Thank you, sir!
I'm gonna go dig in!

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:55.480 position:50% align:center
Suppose I'll handle Grimm's
wake up duty, Agent Six.

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:56.981 position:50% align:center
Which means...

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.483 position:50% align:center

You using me as a shield again?

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:34.491 position:50% align:center
It's just as I suspected.

--[GRIMM yelps]
--[BOTH] Hmm?

00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:39.329 position:50% align:center
Why...? I know
I'm a sound sleeper,

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:42.332 position:50% align:center
but stop taking such violent
measures to wake me.

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:45.794 position:50% align:center
Whatever. You're finally awake
now and that's what matters.

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:48.380 position:50% align:center
I can't move for
a few minutes, by the way.

So, if you can keep me from
getting killed in that time,

00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:51.508 position:50% align:center
that'd be great.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.093 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM]
Huh...?

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:59.432 position:50% align:center
Hey, Boss, listen.
When this big battle is over,

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:01.101 position:50% align:center
I really wanna eat
some yummy food!

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:03.520 position:50% align:center
I'd just about die
for some yummy alcohol!

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:04.562 position:50% align:center
Fine, damn it!

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:06.564 position:50% align:center
Protect me now,
and I'll buy later!

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:08.692 position:50% align:center
You're gonna regret it,
though, Grimm.

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:14.906 position:50% align:center
[HEINE]
Hello, Six. So, we meet again.

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:16.700 position:50% align:center
But... I'd prefer we
don't leave things

00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:18.576 position:50% align:center
hanging this time around.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.954 position:50% align:center
Wait, Heine! I got
a little question for ya!

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:23.581 position:50% align:center
[SIX] I gotta figure out
how buy some time.

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:25.959 position:50% align:center
And that is...?

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:27.460 position:50% align:center
What did they
feed you to grow a pair of

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.963 position:50% align:center
phenomenal funbags like that?

00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
[HEINE grunts]

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:37.345 position:50% align:center
[ROSE grunts] All due respect,
Boss, that was a dumb strategy!

00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:40.181 position:50% align:center
Oh! I'm actually happy
to come across someone

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:42.017 position:50% align:center
who can handle my flames.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.978 position:50% align:center
That crazed woman was
a total disappointment.

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.105 position:50% align:center
But you seem like you'll be fun.

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:48.231 position:50% align:center
Crazed woman?

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.108 position:50% align:center
She must be talking
about Snow, right?

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:55.864 position:50% align:center
[SNOW wails] I just got this
Glacial Blade and she melted it!

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:58.783 position:50% align:center
I need you to pull out that
weird, ranged weapon you've got

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.994 position:50% align:center
and take brutal vengeance
for my precious Iceberg!

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:04.581 position:50% align:center
Just simmer down, will ya?
I can't really move right now.

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:07.334 position:50% align:center
What, why not?! Is there
some reason you can't move,

00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center
or are you just being mean?!

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
--[SIX] Shut up, you moron!
--[SNOW] Avenge my Iceberg!

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.631 position:50% align:center
It seems as though
this man, Six, is frozen.

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
I'll go easy on you and
put you out of your misery

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:18.511 position:50% align:center
with a single blow!

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:21.765 position:50% align:center
Hey! That's almost exactly one
of the "Absolute No-No" lines

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:23.933 position:50% align:center
from the Big Book
of Bad Guy Dialogue!

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
Someone has to come save us now.

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:26.978 position:50% align:center
Those flames are
bad news, Commander!

00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:30.523 position:50% align:center
I won't be able to block them!
We have to go right now!

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:32.108 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM]
Great Lord Zenarith!

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:34.569 position:50% align:center
I beseech you
bring disaster upon her!

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:36.988 position:50% align:center
And paralyze her now.

00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:40.992 position:50% align:center
What's happening?!
Is it some kind of curse?

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:43.244 position:50% align:center
[VOICE 1A]
Cooldown is now complete.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.667 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Hmm. Whoa there, Grimm.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.752 position:50% align:center
It's kind of hard to believe,
but I guess you may actually

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:53.254 position:50% align:center
be useful after all, huh?

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:55.465 position:50% align:center
Um. Hold on just one second.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:58.093 position:50% align:center
Does that mean you
thought I wasn't useful?

00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:00.261 position:50% align:center
Those three minutes
felt like forever.

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:03.390 position:50% align:center
Well, this is bad.
My main objective for today

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:06.226 position:50% align:center
was testing the golem's
battle functionality.

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:08.853 position:50% align:center
Things tend to go south
when you're around, huh?

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:11.606 position:50% align:center
Hey, tell me, Six.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.150 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you don't
want to come to our side?

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:16.277 position:50% align:center
We'll pay you three times
what you're getting now.

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:17.654 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--[HEINE] Oh, and you've heard

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.614 position:50% align:center
of a succubus, right?

00:12:19.698 --> 00:12:21.991 position:50% align:center
--Damn straight!
--Get off your knees, Agent Six!

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:24.202 position:50% align:center
You can't let the enemy
bait you like that!

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:25.286 position:50% align:center
Draw your gun!

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.122 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM]
Get a hold of yourself, Sir!

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:28.206 position:50% align:center
Oh, it wore off.

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:31.042 position:50% align:center
Now, brave Six.
I'll take you there.

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:33.712 position:50% align:center
To Succubi with
insatiable appetites.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:37.173 position:50% align:center
Lilim, with unripe bodies
who want you to spoil them.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:39.926 position:50% align:center
Vampires with
an otherworldly beauty.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:44.347 position:50% align:center
Sirens who'll whisper sweet,
sexy sounds in your ear.

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:46.558 position:50% align:center
Alice... I'm sorry...

00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:48.768 position:50% align:center
But I'm too weak for this...

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:51.855 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:53.857 position:50% align:center
[SNOW yells]

00:12:58.236 --> 00:12:59.904 position:50% align:center
--[SNOW] Huh...?
--Uh. Hey, um...

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:02.115 position:50% align:center
That's... That's, uh...

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:04.367 position:50% align:center
Huh. I can tell by your response

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:06.119 position:50% align:center
that it's something
very important.

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:07.704 position:50% align:center
No, it's just, uh...

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:09.414 position:50% align:center
--[GRIMM] That's magicite.
--[gasps]

00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:10.540 position:50% align:center
Magicite, you say?

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.500 position:50% align:center
Yes. It's a special
kind of conduit

00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:14.669 position:50% align:center
that wizards use
to harness their magic.

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:16.963 position:50% align:center
I feel incredible
power coming from it.

00:13:17.047 --> 00:13:20.467 position:50% align:center
Yes. Oh! It's obviously had
magic concentrated into it

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.385 position:50% align:center
over many years.

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:24.888 position:50% align:center
So if Heine were to lose
the thing, then what?

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.515 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM] Well, theoretically,
she could use another one.

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:29.476 position:50% align:center
But it likely won't give
her enough power to be

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:31.311 position:50% align:center
--one of the Elite Four.
--[HEINE whimpering]

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:34.939 position:50% align:center
--[BOTH] Heh.
--[HEINE squeals]

--[HEINE groans]
--[camera shutter clicking]

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:45.617 position:50% align:center
[SIX sighs] Oh, yeah, there's
the goods! Just like that! Boom!

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.702 position:50% align:center
[VOICE 1A]
You earned evil points!

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:49.245 position:50% align:center
--[SIX] That's the stuff.
--Good job, Six.

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:50.789 position:50% align:center
--Yeah, squeeze 'em.
--Keep racking up those points.

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:52.999 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Part the knees,
pop out the dumper...

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:56.294 position:50% align:center
Little more... Flex them calves.
Knees further apart!

00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center
[VOICE 1A]
You earned Evil Points

00:13:57.962 --> 00:14:00.590 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Oh-ho-ho! She's twitching!
I saw her twitching! Amazing.

00:14:00.674 --> 00:14:02.926 position:50% align:center
But... why the heck
is he doing all this?

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:06.096 position:50% align:center
Because I'm pretty sure it's in
his disgusting and vile nature

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:07.722 position:50% align:center
and he has no choice.

00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:09.057 position:50% align:center
[VOICE 1A]
You earned evil points!

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.517 position:50% align:center
--Evil points! Evil points!
--[SIX] Yes! Booyah!

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.810 position:50% align:center
--Evil points! Evil points!
--Whoa, there! Gimme dat!

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:13.061 position:50% align:center
--Evil points!
--Awesome!

00:14:13.144 --> 00:14:16.690 position:50% align:center
[SNOW giggles] Quite an
ingenious strategy, Six!

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:18.733 position:50% align:center
Subjecting a powerful foe
to shame after giving her

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:20.276 position:50% align:center
a good, hard beating.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.444 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right.

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:23.196 position:50% align:center
This is for desecrating Iceberg!

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:24.781 position:50% align:center
[cackles]

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:26.116 position:50% align:center
I know she's the enemy,

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:28.159 position:50% align:center
but I'm starting to kinda
feel bad for her now.

00:14:28.243 --> 00:14:30.620 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's time for you
to give her back her stone?

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:32.122 position:50% align:center
Hey, Alice.

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:34.165 position:50% align:center
I don't remember saying I was
gonna give it back to her.

00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:35.959 position:50% align:center
--No, you never said that.
--[ROSE, GRIMM gasp]

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:38.003 position:50% align:center
Apparently, she just assumed
you would and went straight

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:39.421 position:50% align:center
into the humiliation.

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:41.923 position:50% align:center
You would make me do this,
and not give it back?!

00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:44.509 position:50% align:center
I'll kill you, and I'll
take my time doing it!

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:46.052 position:50% align:center
Yeah? But what can
you actually do

00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:47.971 position:50% align:center
without your
wittle magic thingy?

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:49.931 position:50% align:center
--You're stuck, aren't ya?
--[HEINE growls]

00:14:50.015 --> 00:14:51.808 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Come on!
Show me what ya got!

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.853 position:50% align:center
Awww, never mind, tell ya what.
If ya really want it back...

00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:56.980 position:50% align:center
Yeah, just tell me
what I need to do!

00:14:57.063 --> 00:14:58.982 position:50% align:center
Please, Six!
It's important to me...

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:00.984 position:50% align:center

Here we go!

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:03.028 position:50% align:center
Oh no... Six, I...

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:04.279 position:50% align:center
What are you doing...?

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:06.781 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Family jewels, huh?
It's right here.

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:08.491 position:50% align:center
How bad do you want it?

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:10.243 position:50% align:center
[VOICE 1A]
You earned Evil Points.

00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:14.414 position:50% align:center
[HEINE]
No...!

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:19.461 position:50% align:center
Curse you, Six! You'll pay
for this, you hear me?!

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:22.756 position:50% align:center
Retreat! Everyone, retreat!

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:24.799 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 4D]
Did... Did we win...?

00:15:24.883 --> 00:15:26.551 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 4E]
I think so...

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:32.557 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS cheering]

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.476 position:50% align:center

Cheers!

[SIX gulping]

00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:38.855 position:50% align:center
Aw, yeah!

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:40.231 position:50% align:center
That was absolutely amazing,

00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:41.399 position:50% align:center
--Six!
--[SIX] Right?!

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:42.942 position:50% align:center
That goon army just
fell to pieces once

00:15:43.026 --> 00:15:44.736 position:50% align:center
--Heine was vanquished!
--[SIX] Uh-huh!

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
We pulled out
a major victory today!

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:47.989 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
I know!

00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:50.116 position:50% align:center
O Great Lord Zenarith.
Because of your blessing,

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.787 position:50% align:center
I'm not back at the Altar
of Revival, so thank you!

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.955 position:50% align:center
Ever since the commander came
to us, I've gotten to eat

00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:59.000 position:50% align:center
so much yummy stuff,
and it's made me so happy!

00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:01.419 position:50% align:center
I love hearing about
how great I am!

00:16:01.503 --> 00:16:04.631 position:50% align:center
Drink up everyone, 'cuz Six is
picking up the tab for ya!

00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:06.925 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS cheering]

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:10.428 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:16:10.512 --> 00:16:12.389 position:50% align:center
That bow can't hide
the badonkadonk,

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:15.100 position:50% align:center
so gimme one of
them drinks, sweet cheeks!

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:18.687 position:50% align:center
I realize death may be the only
cure for terminal stupidity.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.106 position:50% align:center
But you are a real
commander now, ya know?

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:23.858 position:50% align:center
So maybe you'd better straighten
up and start acting like one!

00:16:23.942 --> 00:16:25.819 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! Snow
finally recognized

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
the commander as The Commander!

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:29.656 position:50% align:center
[SNOW growls]
No! No way!

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:31.324 position:50% align:center
I'm telling him real
commanders don't behave

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:34.160 position:50% align:center
like lecherous buffoons!

00:16:34.244 --> 00:16:36.955 position:50% align:center
[sighs] But it seems that
you and Alice have become

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:38.790 position:50% align:center
critical parts of our unit.

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:39.791 position:50% align:center
[SIX grunts]

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:41.835 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Don't get the wrong idea!

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:44.963 position:50% align:center
I still haven't fully accepted
you as a superior officer!

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:46.589 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Listen to a man of culture.

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:49.009 position:50% align:center
She's what we call a "tsundere."

00:16:49.092 --> 00:16:51.094 position:50% align:center
She acts like she hates
my guts, but the truth is,

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
she's totally head over
heels in love with me.

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:56.558 position:50% align:center
Yeah! And this is just, like,
her way of hiding it, huh?

00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:58.351 position:50% align:center
So young and naive.

00:16:58.435 --> 00:16:59.561 position:50% align:center
Right, Snow?

00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:01.855 position:50% align:center
Shut up or I'll kill you!

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:03.064 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

[ARCHER GIRLS laughing]

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:23.835 position:50% align:center
Oh. Agent Six. You're back.

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:26.212 position:50% align:center
I had to carry this
idiot all the way here

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:29.007 position:50% align:center
Ya really know how to
treat a stuperior occifer.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.718 position:50% align:center
Okay, Snow! It's time for
a big, wet goodnight kiss!

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:33.428 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
No! Get off me, you pig.

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:35.513 position:50% align:center
You're lucky to be alive.
Now go to bed!

00:17:35.597 --> 00:17:37.682 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Fine, fine...

00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:39.851 position:50% align:center
Good luck with all this, Alice.

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:43.563 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
I'll try. Thanks. [grunts]

00:17:45.065 --> 00:17:47.067 position:50% align:center
What is his deal, anyway?!

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.152 position:50% align:center
Why does he get off
on insulting me?

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:50.653 position:50% align:center
I can't let him
get away with it.

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:53.031 position:50% align:center
I'll just have to kill
Six myself, someday.

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:55.617 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF OF STAFF] Oh, you plan
to kill Six, do you?

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.662 position:50% align:center
That is an extremely
serious intention to declare.

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:01.164 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:03.166 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Uh...

00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:10.048 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, sir,
but what I said was...

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:11.633 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF OF STAFF]
Don't worry.

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:13.635 position:50% align:center
I'm aware that this rude
and bizarre man seemed

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:15.428 position:50% align:center
to materialize out of thin air,

00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:18.223 position:50% align:center
just for the purpose
of causing you strife.

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:19.808 position:50% align:center
Is that the long
and short of it?

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:21.226 position:50% align:center
Yes, exactly!

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:24.104 position:50% align:center
He's rude, insolent,
insubordinate, inelegant.

00:18:24.187 --> 00:18:25.605 position:50% align:center
All he ever does is make me mad.

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:27.148 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF OF STAFF laughs]
Oh, I'm sure it must

00:18:27.232 --> 00:18:28.775 position:50% align:center
be quite frustrating.

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:30.318 position:50% align:center
[SNOW squeals]

00:18:30.402 --> 00:18:33.071 position:50% align:center
Tell me, Snow. Your wish is to
return to your previous role

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:35.115 position:50% align:center
with the Royal Guard, correct?

00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:38.618 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Uh, honestly, sir...

00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:41.413 position:50% align:center
I grew up as
an orphan in the slums.

00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center
And I worked hard to earn
my position in the Royal Guard.

00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:48.920 position:50% align:center
I would love to.
If it's possible.

00:18:49.004 --> 00:18:52.007 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's possible! After all,
those victories you've claimed

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.676 position:50% align:center
in the last two missions are
enough to easily restore

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
--your former standing.
--No.

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:57.637 position:50% align:center
That glory belongs
to the whole unit.

00:18:57.721 --> 00:18:59.180 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF OF STAFF]
Ever so humble.

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:04.227 position:50% align:center
Then why not see to it that
they reap the rewards as well?

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.688 position:50% align:center
Valid point.

00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] I can just bring them
all with me into my new unit.

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:12.485 position:50% align:center
Alice is very intelligent,
so I imagine she would come up

00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:15.947 position:50% align:center
with our mission plans
and strategies.

00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:17.490 position:50% align:center
Then there's the idiot.

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:20.493 position:50% align:center
He's foul-mouthed, extremely
crass, staggeringly dumb,

00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:22.203 position:50% align:center
and has a nasty personality.

00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:25.373 position:50% align:center
But to be honest, he's a far
better fighter than I am.

00:19:25.457 --> 00:19:27.751 position:50% align:center
Those victories would not
have happened without him.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.337 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Hmm.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50% align:center
Huh? I understand now.

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:34.716 position:50% align:center
It's not just that
foreigner, then.

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:37.719 position:50% align:center
You want to be rid of the half
demon girl, and the lazy one

00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:40.347 position:50% align:center
who worships the evil
god, too, don't you?

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.348 position:50% align:center
No, I--

00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:42.640 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF OF STAFF]
Jog my memory.

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
If I recall correctly,
you said before,

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:48.772 position:50% align:center
this interloper, Six,
is an enemy spy, yes?

00:19:48.855 --> 00:19:51.066 position:50% align:center
No. Turns out I was
wrong about that.

00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:54.319 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF OF STAFF] Since you're
so clever, I have a request.

00:19:55.445 --> 00:19:57.822 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF OF STAFF] I need you to
discover some proof that Six is,

00:19:57.906 --> 00:20:02.077 position:50% align:center
in fact, a spy.
Regardless, if he truly is.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.414 position:50% align:center
I know, but I can't freakin'
stand that bald, one-eyed guy.

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
[SNOW sighs]

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:09.167 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF OF STAFF]
Take him this "bonus."

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:13.046 position:50% align:center
It'll provide you with an excuse
to go and pay him a visit.

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:16.091 position:50% align:center
He just comes off like a petty,
sneaky, small-time villain.

00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:18.885 position:50% align:center
Someone who only cares
about his own survival.

00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
[SNOW sighs]
No.

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:38.822 position:50% align:center
I'll pause on going back
to the knights, for now.

00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:41.116 position:50% align:center
If I keep winning
with my unit as we are,

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:44.285 position:50% align:center
the time for that promotion
will come before too long.

00:20:46.121 --> 00:20:47.914 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Hey, Alice,
what if King Beardie says,

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:49.791 position:50% align:center
"I would like you to
marry my daughter Tillis

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:52.210 position:50% align:center
and rule this land with her"?

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:54.462 position:50% align:center
And the chicks
our unit might say,

00:20:54.546 --> 00:20:57.298 position:50% align:center
"Oh, Six! I'm, like,
so hot for you."

00:20:57.382 --> 00:20:59.676 position:50% align:center
Then we'd have a real
problem on our hands.

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:02.387 position:50% align:center
I can predict a wide
range of occurrences,

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.181 position:50% align:center
and I had thought that nothing
was beyond my understanding.

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:06.808 position:50% align:center
But it seems I was wrong.

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:09.185 position:50% align:center
I don't follow you,
but you're one smart cookie.

00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:10.478 position:50% align:center
A good kid!

00:21:10.562 --> 00:21:11.730 position:50% align:center
[ALICE growls]

00:21:11.813 --> 00:21:14.232 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Hmm. But you know,
if I married ol' Snow,

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:15.775 position:50% align:center
that'd would be,
shall we say,

00:21:15.859 --> 00:21:18.111 position:50% align:center
"stimulating" for
different reasons.

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:20.155 position:50% align:center
By the way, I need
to try to move up

00:21:20.238 --> 00:21:22.198 position:50% align:center
the Kisaragi ladder, too.

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:25.076 position:50% align:center
Which means you and I gotta
get back to that spy mission.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.871 position:50% align:center
Maybe we can parlay our
reward into a hideout, huh?

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:30.206 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't talk about that
in their language.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:31.958 position:50% align:center
--[thud]
--[BOTH gasp]

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:42.719 position:50% align:center
So it's true, you're a spy...

00:23:20.942 --> 00:23:22.068 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
Everything seems to be going

00:23:22.152 --> 00:23:23.903 position:50% align:center
rather swimmingly for Agent Six.

00:23:23.987 --> 00:23:26.197 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL] Is his investigation
wrapping up already?

00:23:26.281 --> 00:23:27.866 position:50% align:center
--That's fast.
--[ASTAROTH] Yes.

00:23:27.949 --> 00:23:30.493 position:50% align:center
Next, he'll be trying
to acquire a hideout.

00:23:30.577 --> 00:23:32.954 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
Something bothering you?

00:23:33.038 --> 00:23:35.457 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] He's never
written such a dry report.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.042 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL]
Yeah, now that you mention it,

00:23:37.125 --> 00:23:39.336 position:50% align:center
did he get sick or something?

00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:42.589 position:50% align:center
Listen! Six may seem like
an idiot but he's actually...
