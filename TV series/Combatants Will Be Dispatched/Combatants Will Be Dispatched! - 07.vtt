00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:14.223 position:50% align:center
[SIX] You're so full of crap,
I can almost smell it from here!

00:00:14.306 --> 00:00:16.433 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
I ever trusted you!

00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:19.770 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] Look. I'm truly sorry
about the teleportation device.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.230 position:50% align:center
So please forgive me, Six!

00:00:21.313 --> 00:00:22.648 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Alice let me know what's up!

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:24.066 position:50% align:center
You sent me here
in some hunk of junk

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.610 position:50% align:center
with a less than
50% success rate!

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.946 position:50% align:center
You owe me a raise
in more ways than one!

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.489 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
How 'bout this?

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:32.866 position:50% align:center
The latest volume of "God's
Blessing on This Wacky World!"

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.826 position:50% align:center
is out! You love this one!

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.956 position:50% align:center
How 'bout I send you a copy?
Consider it as my apology! 'Kay?

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.749 position:50% align:center
I consider it an insult!

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:43.335 position:50% align:center
My life's worth a single
volume of KonoSawa?!

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:45.796 position:50% align:center
Make me your sexy house-husband,
and I might forgive you!

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.214 position:50% align:center
Ah! Cut that out!

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:49.132 position:50% align:center
You're being completely
unreasonable!

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:51.468 position:50% align:center
And will you explain
this latest report?

00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:54.054 position:50% align:center
What's this nonsense
about you not coming back?!

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:56.098 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Can't you read?
I explained it!

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:57.599 position:50% align:center
I'm the boss here.

00:00:57.683 --> 00:00:59.351 position:50% align:center
Which means I can't just
run back home and leave

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:01.728 position:50% align:center
my precious
subordinates hangin'!

00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:03.897 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] From what I can tell,
the war has left a shortage

00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:04.982 position:50% align:center
of young men there.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.358 position:50% align:center
[SIX grunts]

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:07.901 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] And Alice told me
you have only cute girls

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:09.361 position:50% align:center
on your unit.

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:11.864 position:50% align:center
[SIX grunts] So how about
sending some reinforcements?

00:01:11.947 --> 00:01:14.241 position:50% align:center
That big ol' battle was a while
ago and you can only send me

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:15.993 position:50% align:center
one lousy mutant?!

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.996 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] Ugh. We simply
don't have any to spare.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.081 position:50% align:center
Since we're so close
to conquering the world,

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:22.499 position:50% align:center
the heroes have
decided to launch

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:24.668 position:50% align:center
a large-scale counterattack.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:27.796 position:50% align:center
Even Belial and Lilith are
fighting at the front lines,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.423 position:50% align:center
but things look dire.

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:30.966 position:50% align:center
Ah. On that note,

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.135 position:50% align:center
we would rather have you
back at home with us.

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:36.096 position:50% align:center
[SIX grunts] I'm an old model,
with outdated enhancements.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.973 position:50% align:center
I doubt that I could help much.

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:39.933 position:50% align:center
So you should let me
run things here.

00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:43.061 position:50% align:center
And I'm positive that you can
handle whatever comes your way.

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:44.521 position:50% align:center
Such a pain.

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:46.607 position:50% align:center
Well, if you insist
on staying there,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.775 position:50% align:center
you'd better produce results.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:51.320 position:50% align:center
Stop slacking off and get things
ready for our invasion.

00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:52.696 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Geh.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.406 position:50% align:center
What?! How in the fresh hell
am I supposed to do that

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:55.782 position:50% align:center
without any freakin' support?!

00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:57.451 position:50% align:center
Don't think I can't make you
cry just because I'm on

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:59.119 position:50% align:center
another planet, you hear me?!

00:01:59.203 --> 00:02:00.704 position:50% align:center
You can't talk to me
that way just because

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:02.331 position:50% align:center
there's nobody else here!

00:02:02.414 --> 00:02:04.541 position:50% align:center
And you don't have
that power over me!

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:07.085 position:50% align:center
[SIX growls] Oh, you are
wrong about that, sister!

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:08.504 position:50% align:center
Why don't I show
you how I earned

00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:11.256 position:50% align:center
--my new nickname Zipperman?!
--[ASTAROTH] Stop that!

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.342 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Put on your 3-D glasses now!

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:15.177 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH gasps]
I'm sorry about everything!

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.386 position:50% align:center
Now put that thing away!

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.138 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Six, the Snake,
reporting for booty!

00:03:49.313 --> 00:03:51.648 position:50% align:center
[TIGER]
So we meet again, Agent Six!

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:54.359 position:50% align:center
I say, let's finish this,
right meow!

00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:57.154 position:50% align:center
Whatever curls your tail,
Tiger Man.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.698 position:50% align:center
I'll fight ya with my late
subordinate's prized blade,

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:01.241 position:50% align:center
the whatsits-zapper.

00:04:01.325 --> 00:04:03.744 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty paws-itive
she's alive right meow.

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:06.663 position:50% align:center
And it's not fair you get
a magic sword, meow.

00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:09.708 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm fighting a huge,
super-strong, mutant cat.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.627 position:50% align:center
I need some kind of handicap.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.421 position:50% align:center
By the way, that meow crap
is so freakin' cringey.

00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:17.216 position:50% align:center
[TIGER] I heard it's a good way
to get some tail, meow.

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.468 position:50% align:center
Say what? So can I do it, too?

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:21.053 position:50% align:center
[TIGER]
Meow, if you want.

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:23.222 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's rock, Six!

00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:25.807 position:50% align:center
Show me just how strong
you've become, meow!

00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:28.310 position:50% align:center
You'll have eight
lives left, so meow!

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:29.478 position:50% align:center
[TIGER]
Meow!

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:30.938 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:33.607 position:50% align:center
[SIX grunts]

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.608 position:50% align:center
[TIGER groans]

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:36.026 position:50% align:center
[SIX squeals]
Oh, shit!

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.612 position:50% align:center
Ah! Meow. What'd you do...?

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.489 position:50% align:center
Hey, Alice! Fix this somehow!

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Meow-lice, please?

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.700 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Okay, fine.

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:45.827 position:50% align:center
Miss Meowlice has
the purr-fect solution for

00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:47.746 position:50% align:center
you big, meat-headed animals.

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:50.332 position:50% align:center
Just glue the thing
back on and play dumb.

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:51.708 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Meow, yeah!

00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:53.961 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Hey, Six, where are you hiding?!

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:55.629 position:50% align:center
I've finally had enough!

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:57.172 position:50% align:center
Ah. There you are!

00:04:57.256 --> 00:04:59.174 position:50% align:center
And that hairy
demon-thing's with you!

00:04:59.258 --> 00:05:00.717 position:50% align:center
Now what have you
done with my sword?!

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:02.886 position:50% align:center
--Ruh-roh.
--I knew that she'd show up!

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.430 position:50% align:center
Look! You'd better
give back Flame Zapper!

00:05:05.514 --> 00:05:07.432 position:50% align:center
It's still on a five-year loan!

00:05:07.516 --> 00:05:08.809 position:50% align:center
[TIGER groaning]

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:10.811 position:50% align:center
Uh. That sword, uh...

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:11.854 position:50% align:center
...went on a journey.

00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:13.105 position:50% align:center
What?

00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:15.190 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it, like, became
self-aware or something.

00:05:15.274 --> 00:05:17.693 position:50% align:center
It told me it was off
to find its real master.

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:19.945 position:50% align:center
Don't be dumb!
And if that were true somehow,

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:23.115 position:50% align:center
I'm quite certain it would
recognize me as its real master!

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:24.366 position:50% align:center
Wait!

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.702 position:50% align:center
What are you two hiding...?

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:28.704 position:50% align:center
Yeah... As a matter of fact,

00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:31.248 position:50% align:center
the thing just recently
returned from its quest.

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.750 position:50% align:center
I hate to break it to you,
but it lost its brave battle

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:35.169 position:50% align:center
with the demon lord.

00:05:35.252 --> 00:05:36.753 position:50% align:center
[SNOW gasps]

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:43.510 position:50% align:center
[sobs]

00:05:43.594 --> 00:05:45.762 position:50% align:center
[SIX] It cried out
your name one final time,

00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:47.347 position:50% align:center
and then it went back
to a regular sword

00:05:47.431 --> 00:05:48.974 position:50% align:center
that can't tell on me.

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:50.601 position:50% align:center
Flame Zapper!

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:53.896 position:50% align:center
I'll never forget polishing you
every single night before bed!

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
My precious flamey boy!

00:05:55.898 --> 00:05:58.901 position:50% align:center
The day I bought you, I was
so happy I couldn't sleep!

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:01.486 position:50% align:center
--[TIGER] Oh, here we go.
--[SNOW] I held you every night.

00:06:03.322 --> 00:06:04.781 position:50% align:center
For you.

00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:06.283 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Wow, that is beautiful.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.785 position:50% align:center
What an amazing work
of craftsmanship.

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:10.746 position:50% align:center
It's yours if you want it, meow.

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:12.956 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank you
so much, Tiger Man!

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.374 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:16.585 position:50% align:center
I had a feline you were
a purrty great kind of creature,

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:18.462 position:50% align:center
you big fuzzy kitty! Meow!

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:21.423 position:50% align:center
What?! You just called me
a demon a meowment ago!

00:06:21.507 --> 00:06:23.467 position:50% align:center
Now, back off--
you're wrinklin' the fur.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.968 position:50% align:center
That's kinda crazy.

00:06:25.052 --> 00:06:27.679 position:50% align:center
I guess the pussycat talk does
bring in the chicks, huh?

00:06:27.763 --> 00:06:29.556 position:50% align:center
Look, she-beast
here's too thicc.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.142 position:50% align:center
I like mine younger
and slimmer. Meow.

00:06:32.226 --> 00:06:33.727 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Uh?

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.688 position:50% align:center
Me-wow, Tiger Man.
You're a piece of work.

00:06:36.772 --> 00:06:38.774 position:50% align:center
[bell tolling]

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:40.275 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
An attack?

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:42.277 position:50% align:center
Now, Six! Let's move out!

00:06:42.361 --> 00:06:44.446 position:50% align:center
There's some glory
to be claimed!

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.074 position:50% align:center
Hey, will you stay and watch
the castle for me, big guy?

00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:48.659 position:50% align:center
Totes magotes!

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:53.497 position:50% align:center
[SNOW guffaws] Oh, can't wait
to swing this baby around!

00:06:55.207 --> 00:06:57.793 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Here's to another
victory, y'all.

00:06:57.876 --> 00:06:59.545 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Cheers!

00:07:00.838 --> 00:07:02.256 position:50% align:center
[SIX gulping]

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:03.632 position:50% align:center
Ahh!

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:06.051 position:50% align:center
Nothing like a strong drink
to forget about work!

00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:08.095 position:50% align:center
Hey, girls,
it's all on me today!

00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:09.429 position:50% align:center
Get those bottoms up!

00:07:09.513 --> 00:07:10.848 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:13.809 position:50% align:center
[grunting] I gotta say,
I absolutely love the commander

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:16.019 position:50% align:center
when he gets into a food
buying mood like this!

00:07:16.103 --> 00:07:17.563 position:50% align:center
Yes, it is very charming.

00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:19.940 position:50% align:center
But I don't think I'd want a
husband that spent so much money

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:21.859 position:50% align:center
at the bar all of the time.

00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:24.236 position:50% align:center
Ah-ha! Aww, you girls
are such sweeties!

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:27.197 position:50% align:center
I don't believe I would
classify those as "compliments."

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:29.783 position:50% align:center
Everyone says he's never
lost against the demons!

00:07:29.867 --> 00:07:32.494 position:50% align:center
Unbelievable! That is so cool!

00:07:32.578 --> 00:07:35.539 position:50% align:center
Yeah, baby. The ladies
know I'm the top stud in town.

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:36.748 position:50% align:center
Soon, my harem will be--

00:07:36.832 --> 00:07:38.166 position:50% align:center
I smell Zipperman!

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.586 position:50% align:center
'Coz he's got something
stinky behind his zipper!

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:41.795 position:50% align:center
Zip it up, Zipperman!

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:43.172 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Uhh...

00:07:43.255 --> 00:07:44.298 position:50% align:center
[SIX] I'll cut off your heads
and paint the walls

00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:46.216 position:50% align:center
with your brains!
Get back here!

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.468 position:50% align:center
You were such a brave
little sword today.

00:07:48.552 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
I promise I'll give you
a cool name when we get home.

00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:53.056 position:50% align:center
So, Snow. If I'm not mistaken,

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.684 position:50% align:center
you got your gig with
the royal guard back, didn't ya?

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:57.936 position:50% align:center
What are you doing
slumming around with my unit?

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.730 position:50% align:center
I have direct orders
from Princess Tillis

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.398 position:50% align:center
to keep a close eye on you.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.734 position:50% align:center
She probably wants me to work
on building a connection

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.277 position:50% align:center
with your home country.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.529 position:50% align:center
You sure she doesn't just
want to get rid of you?

00:08:07.613 --> 00:08:08.697 position:50% align:center
--How dare!
--Hey, AIice,

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.240 position:50% align:center
you don't eat or drink,

00:08:10.324 --> 00:08:12.367 position:50% align:center
so what made you decide to come
to the bar with us, anyway?

00:08:12.451 --> 00:08:14.620 position:50% align:center
It's part of my research
on this planet.

00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:18.290 position:50% align:center
I'm compiling a large report
to send to Kisaragi HQ.

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:21.043 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe, but both
of you are actually magic users

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:22.836 position:50% align:center
from a far away
world, aren't you?

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
It's not magic.
We are men of science!

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:27.466 position:50% align:center
So, what are you investigating?

00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:29.426 position:50% align:center
Well, the food sources, for one.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.387 position:50% align:center
There's a chance most of what
they eat is toxic to Earthlings.

00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:33.931 position:50% align:center
Like, for example.

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:35.891 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea
what kind of meat that is

00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:37.226 position:50% align:center
and where it came from?

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:40.229 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Hmm? Hmm...

00:08:40.312 --> 00:08:42.523 position:50% align:center
[ROSE] Hmm? Hey, Boss,
if you don't want to eat that,

00:08:42.606 --> 00:08:45.567 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to take it.
I'd love some orc meat!

00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:47.069 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
It's Orc?!

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:49.947 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna eat meat
that talks and has feelings!

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.698 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! Chow time!

00:08:51.782 --> 00:08:53.659 position:50% align:center
Ha! Surprised
you're so delicate.

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:55.953 position:50% align:center
Not that brave when it
comes to food, are ya?

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:57.162 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Shut up!

00:08:57.246 --> 00:08:59.665 position:50% align:center
Hey, Snow, you're off
tomorrow, right?

00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:02.334 position:50% align:center
If you have time to
help me out, I can pay you.

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:03.377 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Oh, really?

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.629 position:50% align:center
I do have some
big loans to pay off!

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:06.922 position:50% align:center
So what do you need?

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:08.924 position:50% align:center
I need you to investigate...

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:11.009 position:50% align:center
...whatever this is.

00:09:19.101 --> 00:09:21.895 position:50% align:center
[SUPOPOCCHI roars]

00:09:21.979 --> 00:09:24.064 position:50% align:center
[MOKE]
Moke-moke!

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:26.024 position:50% align:center
See? That's a Moke-moke.

00:09:26.108 --> 00:09:27.568 position:50% align:center
As for me, I like 'em stewed.

00:09:27.651 --> 00:09:29.903 position:50% align:center
The name is cute,
but they're terrifying!

00:09:29.987 --> 00:09:31.697 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] And that thing
that it's trying to devour

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.199 position:50% align:center
is called a supopocchi.
They're quite tasty.

00:09:34.283 --> 00:09:36.869 position:50% align:center
The supopocchi's
putting up a fight.

00:09:36.952 --> 00:09:39.705 position:50% align:center
It seems snakes on this planet
attack with tail slaps.

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:41.123 position:50% align:center
Fascinating.

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:43.041 position:50% align:center
It's actually pretty rare
for them to use their tail

00:09:43.125 --> 00:09:44.459 position:50% align:center
to fight like this.

00:09:44.543 --> 00:09:47.087 position:50% align:center
So we're lucky that
we get to see it.

00:09:47.171 --> 00:09:50.132 position:50% align:center
This is all excellent data.
Let's get going.

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:52.176 position:50% align:center
[SIX] How about we stop talking,
and bail before that thing

00:09:52.259 --> 00:09:53.510 position:50% align:center
figures out we're here!

00:09:53.594 --> 00:09:56.513 position:50% align:center
[roaring]

00:09:56.597 --> 00:09:59.975 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hey, Snow, why is
that supopocchi hanging

00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:01.518 position:50% align:center
from the tree?

00:10:01.602 --> 00:10:03.187 position:50% align:center
Because that's what
the Headsplitters do

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
to mark their territory.

00:10:04.897 --> 00:10:07.024 position:50% align:center
Okay, what kind of name is that?

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:08.650 position:50% align:center
Have either of you ever
heard of something

00:10:08.734 --> 00:10:10.068 position:50% align:center
called self-preservation?

00:10:10.152 --> 00:10:11.236 position:50% align:center
Now these Headsplitters

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.780 position:50% align:center
are extremely
territorial barbarians.

00:10:13.864 --> 00:10:15.824 position:50% align:center
Their name comes from
their practice of "splitting"

00:10:15.908 --> 00:10:18.410 position:50% align:center
the "heads" of their
prey with axes.

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:20.245 position:50% align:center
What amazing information!

00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:22.206 position:50% align:center

Yes, exactly.

00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:30.297 position:50% align:center
That knocking sound is
how they tell the others

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.758 position:50% align:center
that they've located prey.

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:34.510 position:50% align:center

Yeah. Well. I guess
not everyone has

00:10:57.658 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
the same keen instincts
as me, so I shouldn't be

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.495 position:50% align:center
too hard on them.

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:05.415 position:50% align:center
Hey, if you guys are around,
you stop hiding and come out!

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:38.699 position:50% align:center

that I don't know anything

about this planet.

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:44.079 position:50% align:center
This jumbo shrimp monster
might be friendly.

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:46.290 position:50% align:center
I mean... Although
we're different species,

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:50.043 position:50% align:center
born on different planets,
we're here together now.

00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:53.338 position:50% align:center

Be nice to him! Anyway,
I wanna tell you something.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.662 position:50% align:center
Grimm made me watch
this Zenarith ceremony,

00:12:25.746 --> 00:12:27.289 position:50% align:center
and she did a weird ritual.

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:29.249 position:50% align:center
It was kinda scary because
she was able to summon

00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:30.876 position:50% align:center
--this undead, and then she--
--[GRIMM] Here you go!

Why don't you try some
of this yummy kebab?

It'll keep your mouth
occupied for a bit.

00:12:35.005 --> 00:12:37.799 position:50% align:center
So, Grimm, did you really
summon the undead again?

00:12:37.883 --> 00:12:39.676 position:50% align:center
--[ALICE] Hmm?
--[GRIMM] Well, what if I did?

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.762 position:50% align:center
I am an Archpriest of
the great Lord Zenarith,

00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:43.805 position:50% align:center
the God of Undeath and Disaster.

00:12:43.889 --> 00:12:46.433 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with
summoning some undead--

00:12:46.517 --> 00:12:47.768 position:50% align:center
Ow! Ow!

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:49.811 position:50% align:center
Hang on, Grimm,
when you say "undead,"

00:12:49.895 --> 00:12:51.772 position:50% align:center
do you mean things like
zombies and ghosts?

00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:53.482 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Exactly.

00:12:53.565 --> 00:12:56.151 position:50% align:center
Rose is talking about me
summoning a ghost.

00:12:56.235 --> 00:12:57.361 position:50% align:center
Hey, Six.

00:12:57.444 --> 00:12:59.488 position:50% align:center
Are you hearing all
of this occult nonsense?

00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:01.490 position:50% align:center
I'm a disciple of science,
so I consider this

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:03.450 position:50% align:center
as a declaration of war.

00:13:03.534 --> 00:13:05.786 position:50% align:center
There is no magic in this world
now that Moke's dead,

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:06.870 position:50% align:center
so who cares?

00:13:06.954 --> 00:13:08.413 position:50% align:center
Oh, stop crying.

00:13:08.497 --> 00:13:11.542 position:50% align:center
What I mean is that psychic
powers are what they call magic.

00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:13.460 position:50% align:center
Heine of the Flame's
"fire magic"

00:13:13.544 --> 00:13:16.296 position:50% align:center
is just run-of-the-mill
pyrokinesis.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.757 position:50% align:center
Its kinda like having
a badass sixth sense.

00:13:18.841 --> 00:13:22.302 position:50% align:center
Can confirm. Things with "six"
in the name are hella cool.

00:13:22.386 --> 00:13:25.931 position:50% align:center
What I'm saying is ghosts are
way less plausible than magic.

00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:27.474 position:50% align:center
Be careful, Alice.

00:13:27.558 --> 00:13:30.018 position:50% align:center
Doubt Lord Zenarith's power
and he will put a curse on you!

00:13:30.102 --> 00:13:32.729 position:50% align:center
Curses are just hypnosis
and self-suggestion.

00:13:32.813 --> 00:13:34.857 position:50% align:center
And Lord Zenarith
is just a myth.

00:20:15.591 --> 00:20:18.343 position:50% align:center
Well. On the positive
side, I do take some comfort

00:20:18.427 --> 00:20:20.053 position:50% align:center
in the fact that at least
we were able to prove

00:20:20.137 --> 00:20:21.138 position:50% align:center
my power's real.

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:22.848 position:50% align:center
Oh? You think so?

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:24.725 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM gasps]
Yeah, 'cause that devil--

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:26.643 position:50% align:center
There's no proof that
entire thing wasn't

00:20:26.727 --> 00:20:28.562 position:50% align:center
some kind of staged production.

00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:30.939 position:50% align:center
Besides, I thought I asked
you to show me a ghost.

00:20:31.023 --> 00:20:33.400 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM groans]
I tried...

00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:35.652 position:50% align:center
Well, if you want to fool me,
you're gonna need to try

00:20:35.736 --> 00:20:38.238 position:50% align:center
a lot harder than that...

00:20:38.322 --> 00:20:39.781 position:50% align:center
...third-rate con artist...

00:20:39.865 --> 00:20:42.242 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM gasps]
How dare you!

00:20:42.326 --> 00:20:44.161 position:50% align:center
I worked extra-hard because
I wanted to prove

00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:46.538 position:50% align:center
--that I wasn't lying!
--[BUNNY 7A squealing]

00:20:49.875 --> 00:20:51.126 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS]
I'm afraid that, at this rate,

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.755 position:50% align:center
we're going to run out
of water completely.

00:20:54.838 --> 00:20:57.508 position:50% align:center
This is not what
I wanted to do,

00:20:57.591 --> 00:21:00.135 position:50% align:center
but there's just
no other choice.

00:21:00.219 --> 00:21:02.679 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] We've conducted surveys
on the local ecosystems

00:21:02.763 --> 00:21:04.890 position:50% align:center
as well as occult beliefs.

00:21:04.973 --> 00:21:08.101 position:50% align:center
I'll gather more data, however,
I still remain skeptical

00:21:08.185 --> 00:21:10.103 position:50% align:center
of the existence of devils.

00:21:10.187 --> 00:21:12.189 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
I still wish I had a harem...

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:13.565 position:50% align:center
Man, if I had been there,

00:21:13.649 --> 00:21:17.027 position:50% align:center
I'da sold my furballs
to get my wish, meow.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.487 position:50% align:center
What would you have wished for?

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:21.365 position:50% align:center
I would wish to be a pretty
little girl, meow!

00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:25.410 position:50% align:center
Uh. Guess you're pretty
serious about that, meow.

00:21:25.494 --> 00:21:27.412 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's kind of a bummer.

00:21:27.496 --> 00:21:29.790 position:50% align:center
When I retire, I'll ask Lilith
for the surgery to make me

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:31.291 position:50% align:center
a pretty grrrl, meow.

00:21:31.375 --> 00:21:34.294 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Would you stop with
the stupid meow thing, guys?

00:21:34.378 --> 00:21:36.880 position:50% align:center
And I had a very lengthy
negotiation with

00:21:36.964 --> 00:21:40.133 position:50% align:center
a so-called "devil."
I found them lacking.

00:21:40.217 --> 00:21:42.636 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:42.719 --> 00:21:44.263 position:50% align:center
Meow...

00:23:17.064 --> 00:23:20.275 position:50% align:center
Alice always has
the most precise reports.

00:23:20.359 --> 00:23:22.361 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL]
Hey, what's this at the end?

00:23:22.444 --> 00:23:24.071 position:50% align:center
--[ASTAROTH gasps]
--[LILITH] "Meow."

00:23:24.154 --> 00:23:25.572 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL]
"Meow"?

00:23:25.656 --> 00:23:27.908 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] Must be a typo.
Anyway, that's our meeting.

00:23:27.991 --> 00:23:30.619 position:50% align:center
We've got a tough fight
ahead of us, but I believe in--

00:23:30.702 --> 00:23:32.120 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL]
Ugh, I'm on it!

00:23:32.204 --> 00:23:34.998 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
I don't even know word defeat.

00:23:35.082 --> 00:23:37.584 position:50% align:center
I wish both of you
the best of luck.

00:23:39.044 --> 00:23:41.713 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] You'll come home
soon, right, Six? "Meow"?

00:23:41.797 --> 00:23:42.714 position:50% align:center
[LILITH, BELIAL groan]

00:23:42.798 --> 00:23:44.299 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH laughs]
Nope, no way.

00:23:44.383 --> 00:23:46.260 position:50% align:center
That doesn't feel like
my character at all.

00:23:46.343 --> 00:23:47.761 position:50% align:center
Oh well, I wonder
what's for dinner!

00:23:47.845 --> 00:23:48.929 position:50% align:center
[LILITH, BELIAL chuckle]
