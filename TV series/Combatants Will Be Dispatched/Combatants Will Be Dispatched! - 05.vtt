[SIX growls]

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:22.522 position:50% align:center
You're always bragging
about your training,

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:23.982 position:50% align:center
but ya don't know how to knock?

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:26.526 position:50% align:center
What if I was having
some intimate "me" time?

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.863 position:50% align:center
Or were you hoping to get a
naughty little show, boobzilla?

Give up, Six. It's hopeless.

I won't ask you who
you truly are. Okay?

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:43.126 position:50% align:center
You helped protect the kingdom,
so it's the least I can do.

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:47.672 position:50% align:center
But I will ask you
to leave. Right now.

that I never see you again.

old my job back this quickly.

be prepared for a massive attack

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.018 position:50% align:center

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:09.022 position:50% align:center
Got it. Excellent work. Thanks.

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:10.815 position:50% align:center
Um, and Rose?

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.777 position:50% align:center
Just call me the same thing
you've always called me.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.572 position:50% align:center
Uh? Sure!
You're still Snow to me!

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:19.032 position:50% align:center

Mm.

Oh-ho-ho! Whoa!

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.841 position:50% align:center

--Guess I'll claim the bathroom.

Ah? You don't even have
the bathroom parts!

[ALICE]
I suppose you're right,

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.974 position:50% align:center
so it would be in your best
interest to switch with me.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.518 position:50% align:center
A-Ah...

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.228 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Now then, Six.

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:50.730 position:50% align:center
We do need to get back
to our primary mission.

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:53.274 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.
Setting up the teleporter

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.068 position:50% align:center
and then connecting
it to Earth, huh?

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:58.154 position:50% align:center
Yes. As soon as
it's all ready to go,

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:01.366 position:50% align:center
we send in our combat agents
and the invasion will begin.

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:02.826 position:50% align:center
Once our homies roll in,

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.911 position:50% align:center
the Demon Lord'll
be crappin' his pants.

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:07.914 position:50% align:center
This mission turned out
to be pretty easy, huh?

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.213 position:50% align:center
It seems like
something's bothering you.

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:18.383 position:50% align:center
I was created to provide
you with support, after all.

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:20.301 position:50% align:center
So what's on
your mind, little guy?

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:23.555 position:50% align:center
Peh! I'm an operative
for an evil organization.

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:26.558 position:50% align:center
I don't give a crap about
this backasswards planet!

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.935 position:50% align:center
Plus, the beer here sucks!

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:30.770 position:50% align:center
And as soon as I get back home,

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:33.565 position:50% align:center
I'ma drink a whole
keg of the good stuff!

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:36.151 position:50% align:center
I see. If that's the case,

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
I'll get started on
assembling the teleporter.

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:41.406 position:50% align:center
It'll take a month for the
phase space to fully stabilize,

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:43.658 position:50% align:center
so you should go out
and have a little fun.

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:45.201 position:50% align:center
A month, for real?

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.579 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I explained that
when we got here, didn't I?

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.247 position:50% align:center
No?

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.457 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Oh, yeah.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.500 position:50% align:center
The Demon Lord's army
is up to something.

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:54.210 position:50% align:center
Isn't that, like,
their whole deal?

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:55.587 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Just listen to me.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.714 position:50% align:center
Currently, the so-called
"chosen one" has a member

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:59.299 position:50% align:center
of the Elite Four pinned down.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:02.052 position:50% align:center
But him being gone leaves
an opening back at the capital,

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.012 position:50% align:center
so, the other three
are making preparations for

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.056 position:50% align:center
all-out attack in his absence.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.475 position:50% align:center
Wait, their army's
gonna be coming back?

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:10.810 position:50% align:center

we've never seen before.

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:12.479 position:50% align:center

I knew you'd regret kicking out
ya boi "The Six" like that!

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:19.694 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah, I realize that
she overheard me say,

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:21.237 position:50% align:center
"I'm a spy!" or whatever.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.782 position:50% align:center
But she could've at least
let me explain myself.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:27.160 position:50% align:center
Most places wouldn't
hesitate to execute a spy.

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:30.121 position:50% align:center
Right? Letting you just walk
away was actually a big deal.

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:32.916 position:50% align:center
I think that was most likely
her way of paying you back.

Ugh. Well, don't look at me!

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.049 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna go save her.
I'm a bad guy.

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:44.969 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Yes, but still...

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:47.055 position:50% align:center
I don't like the idea of
somebody else wreaking havoc

00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:49.391 position:50% align:center
on the place we're
going to invade.

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:52.060 position:50% align:center

decide to quit

I did ask Snow, but...
she would never say a word.

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:32.137 position:50% align:center
She wouldn't stop
coming on to me,

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.430 position:50% align:center
and I couldn't stand
being treated like

a next time, understand?

on some mines.

a spell called Random Teleport

with the kingdom's hero.

There's no telling
where they went.

It could be up in the sky
or far underground.

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:16.486 position:50% align:center
Wherever they are, odds tell me
that the Chosen One is dead.

sorta bad for the guy.

[ALICE] Nevermind.
Didn't their "ancient legend"

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:32.877 position:50% align:center
supposedly foretell that
the Chosen One would

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:34.587 position:50% align:center
defeat the Demon Lord?

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
I know it's not
based in science,

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.675 position:50% align:center
but everything else so far has
seemed to pretty much follow it,

practically unheard of

Is there a certain way that
a typical chosen one's

story usually plays out?

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:58.403 position:50% align:center
Uh... There's normally
a big loss.

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:01.990 position:50% align:center
He'll get wrecked by the enemy,
then there's the training arc,

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
and then he can finally
get his sweet revenge.

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:07.912 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Do you think that the
random teleport is the big loss?

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:10.165 position:50% align:center
No. I'm afraid not.

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:13.376 position:50% align:center
We know the Chosen One's already
been beaten once, remember?

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.963 position:50% align:center
At the hands of those two boss
demons back in Duster Tower.

00:13:17.047 --> 00:13:20.717 position:50% align:center
So, in a normal situation,
he would train harder than ever,

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.303 position:50% align:center
get his revenge, and restore
hope to the people,

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:24.512 position:50% align:center
but this time...

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:26.181 position:50% align:center
So what are you trying
to say here, Alice?

00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:27.974 position:50% align:center
That the Chosen One's
legend went to crap

00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:29.809 position:50% align:center
because I took the tower?

Hey! You're a high-spec
machine, right?!

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:33.980 position:50% align:center
Isn't there something
we can do?!

00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:36.608 position:50% align:center
Yes, but only if you're willing
to do whatever it takes.

00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:38.443 position:50% align:center
Then lay it on me!

biological or chemical weapons

Nope. Next.

00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:47.202 position:50% align:center
I can go on a solo mission into

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:50.163 position:50% align:center
self-destruct, and vaporize
everything within a wide area.

No freakin' way!

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:53.958 position:50% align:center
Is there an option that
doesn't completely suck?

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:54.959 position:50% align:center
There's not.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.252 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:58.797 position:50% align:center
The Chosen One being
out of the picture is bad.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
Even if the Demon Lord's army
is driven back this time,

him down the line.

[gasps]

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.661 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS] It's nice to
see you again, Agent Six.

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:30.954 position:50% align:center
Nope! No way!

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:33.498 position:50% align:center
But I haven't even made
any request of you.

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:35.000 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and how about
we keep it that way?

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.668 position:50% align:center
'Cuz you want me to fight
this creepy Demon Lord

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:38.420 position:50% align:center
or be your boy toy,
and I'm too busy!

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:41.297 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS] Uh. I don't quite
grasp the "boy toy" part of it,

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.133 position:50% align:center
but here.

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:45.135 position:50% align:center
--[SIX] Uh...
--[ALICE] Hmm?

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:47.721 position:50% align:center
You do recognize
what this is, don't you?

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:49.639 position:50% align:center
--My parachute.
--You moron!

00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:52.684 position:50% align:center
I see. This device is called
a "parachute," you say?

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:53.810 position:50% align:center
[SIX, ALICE gasp]

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.645 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS]
I'll get straight to the point.

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
Agent Six...

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:58.898 position:50% align:center
You really are
a spy, aren't you?

00:14:58.982 --> 00:15:01.860 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:04.195 position:50% align:center
Too bad. Well...

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:06.573 position:50% align:center
It seems we'll have
to torture you, then!

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:07.782 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
I admit it! I am a spy!

00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:09.868 position:50% align:center
I lied, okay?!
Please have mercy on me!

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:11.286 position:50% align:center
Well, that was quick.

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:13.830 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS giggles]

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:15.582 position:50% align:center
Uh. Wait.

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:19.002 position:50% align:center
So, uh, are you, like,
gonna arrest us, or...?

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:23.048 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS] No, I'm not.
I wasn't planning on it, anyway.

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.342 position:50% align:center
But I do have a request of you.

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.052 position:50% align:center
[SIX grunts]

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:31.056 position:50% align:center
Come tomorrow, this great
kingdom will likely fall.

00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:32.557 position:50% align:center
[SIX gasps]

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.143 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS] All I want is
for you to bear witness

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:38.563 position:50% align:center
to the final moments of our
valiant knights and soldiers.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.523 position:50% align:center
And then, tell those
in your homeland

00:15:40.607 --> 00:15:42.609 position:50% align:center
of the Kingdom of Grace.

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:45.779 position:50% align:center
How we stood strong
in the face of the enemy.

00:15:45.862 --> 00:15:48.239 position:50% align:center
And how our forces
fought bravely.

00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:55.038 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS] Please. Raise the alarm
about this looming danger

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:58.416 position:50% align:center
so they can fully prepare
for the Demon Lord's army.

00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:02.504 position:50% align:center
[SIX grunts]

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:08.259 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Man... I feel like
such a sucker,

00:16:08.343 --> 00:16:10.720 position:50% align:center
but how could I say no to that?

00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:12.847 position:50% align:center
Do you think that we
should just run, instead?

00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:15.016 position:50% align:center
If we do, it'll be
better to sneak away

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.143 position:50% align:center
while the Demon Lord's
army's attacking.

00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:18.687 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
Hey, it's the commander!

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.272 position:50% align:center
Well, what a pleasant
surprise to see you again.

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:23.566 position:50% align:center
I was actually a little worried
after hearing how badly

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:24.943 position:50% align:center
Snow had sexually harassed you.

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:27.153 position:50% align:center
Grimm! That's a lie,
and you know it!

00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:29.030 position:50% align:center
Tillis asked me to stay
and keep an eye on things

00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:31.032 position:50% align:center
in the castle till tomorrow.

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:32.617 position:50% align:center
Luckily, she also said
I can bail

00:16:32.701 --> 00:16:34.411 position:50% align:center
whenever things get too hairy.

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
Oh, okay.

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:38.707 position:50% align:center
The princess is sure to be safe
with you watching out for her!

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.042 position:50% align:center
So do you know where
you guys'll be tomorrow?

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:42.961 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
Don't you worry.

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:45.839 position:50% align:center
Both Grimm and Rose are now
full members of the royal guard.

00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:47.882 position:50% align:center
We're stationed at
the main gate tomorrow.

00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:50.510 position:50% align:center
They're helping to hold
the last line of defense.

00:16:50.593 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
[SIX sighs]
All right, just stay alive.

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:55.724 position:50% align:center
And remember that there's
no shame in running.

00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:56.808 position:50% align:center
There's no way!

00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:58.852 position:50% align:center
We're proud and
courageous royal guards!

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:01.229 position:50% align:center
We'd rather die than
run like cowards!

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:02.230 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't we?!

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:03.273 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM, ROSE grunt]

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:06.192 position:50% align:center
Uh... Hey, ladies.
Back me up here!

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:08.319 position:50% align:center
Um, yeah, I'll do
my best tomorrow!

00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:10.405 position:50% align:center
But, Commander, if things
do get too dangerous,

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:11.948 position:50% align:center
you need to take Tillis and go!

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:15.243 position:50% align:center
And I'm actually gonna try and
stay awake all day tomorrow!

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:18.329 position:50% align:center
Whoever my future husband is,
they need me to survive.

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:20.749 position:50% align:center
You'll both be staying to the
end with me, won't you?!

00:17:20.832 --> 00:17:21.875 position:50% align:center
[BOTH chuckle]

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.376 position:50% align:center
Ooh.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.211 position:50% align:center
[SNOW snarls] Look, so we're
clear, I'm only allowing you

00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:27.797 position:50% align:center
to stay because the princess
said so, you got that?

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:29.924 position:50% align:center
Don't think for a moment
that I've forgiven you!

00:17:30.008 --> 00:17:32.302 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. It sounds like
that stick up your butt

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:33.511 position:50% align:center
has gone sideways.

--[SNOW growls]
--[SIX] Wh-Whoa! Whoa...

00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:37.557 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it's a losing battle,

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.225 position:50% align:center
but I'll beat some
sense into you!

00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:41.561 position:50% align:center
You're really trying
to kill me, aren't you?!

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:42.645 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:44.397 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM]
Hmm? You're not gonna stop them?

00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:46.649 position:50% align:center
No, because
I finally get it now.

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:50.695 position:50% align:center
They fight... but only to hide
their love for each other.

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:54.407 position:50% align:center
[GRIMM chuckles] You're right,
it's disgusting and I love it.

00:17:54.491 --> 00:17:57.702 position:50% align:center
Well, what do you know, Six?
Someone actually likes you.

--[SNOW snarls]
--Hey! That's enough, okay?!

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:01.998 position:50% align:center
You're gonna have to save
a little bit of that blood lust

00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:04.542 position:50% align:center
for the enemy, so calm down!

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:09.923 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL 3A] Soldiers!
By protecting this gate,

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:12.759 position:50% align:center
you are safeguarding
your home, your family,

and your very honor!

Today, we will stand our ground!

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:19.432 position:50% align:center
Show the Demon Lord
that the Chosen One

00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:21.518 position:50% align:center
isn't all they have to fear!

So Agent Six...

What will the enemy's
next move be?

I'm not lyin', I swear!
I saw it!

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:36.282 position:50% align:center
That unicorn was really
using his freakin' horn

00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:38.034 position:50% align:center
to get under the chick's skirt!

--Wow.
--[TILLIS] Excuse me. Six?

I'll bet unicorns are
reincarnated dirty old men.

'em" thing is just a kink!

Do you really need
my help for this?

Now don't get cocky, Gadalkand.

The way that this

make a lot of sense to me.

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:23.473 position:50% align:center
For example, there are things
that would seem impossible,

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:25.266 position:50% align:center
like curses and magic.

your magic as well.

perform this feat one time,

There were some punk kids
calling me "Zipperman,"

00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:53.712 position:50% align:center

literature right where

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.383 position:50% align:center
[ALICE grunts] You gave...
pornography to children?

00:20:58.466 --> 00:21:00.051 position:50% align:center
Well, I had thought
about pantsing them,

00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:01.845 position:50% align:center
but this seemed
like a better idea.

00:21:01.928 --> 00:21:04.264 position:50% align:center
Meh, as long as you got
some Evil points for it,

00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:05.598 position:50% align:center
--I guess it's fine.
--[TILLIS] Manifest, Aquans!

00:21:05.682 --> 00:21:07.017 position:50% align:center
--[water splashing]
--[BOTH] Huh?

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:11.479 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS panting]
What do you think?

00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:15.025 position:50% align:center
That particular magic spell
summons a water spirit.

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:17.068 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I wasn't looking.

00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:20.864 position:50% align:center
I had glanced away, too.
But you can do it again, right?

00:21:20.947 --> 00:21:22.449 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS whines]

00:21:23.366 --> 00:21:26.202 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Is it me, or is the Demon
Lord's army running late?

00:21:26.286 --> 00:21:28.121 position:50% align:center
Maybe they won't
even come today.

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:31.624 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'd imagine the minefield
must be delaying them.

00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:34.169 position:50% align:center
Well, then how about
we all go home for the day?

00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:36.254 position:50% align:center
Or do you think maybe
we should just cut and run?

00:21:36.338 --> 00:21:38.757 position:50% align:center
You two... Honestly.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.676 position:50% align:center
You mean you're not worried
about Snow and the others?

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.596 position:50% align:center
[SIX] They'll be fine.
After all, those gals?

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:47.432 position:50% align:center
They're part of my awesome unit.

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:49.768 position:50% align:center
[DEMON LORD'S ARMY roaring]

00:21:49.851 --> 00:21:53.063 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:21:53.146 --> 00:21:54.981 position:50% align:center
The enemy's arrived.

00:21:55.065 --> 00:21:56.524 position:50% align:center
[SIX grunts]

00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:06.326 position:50% align:center
[HEINE snarling]

00:23:37.709 --> 00:23:40.003 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL] The only thing that
these newbie combat agents

00:23:40.086 --> 00:23:41.963 position:50% align:center
want to do is fight each other.

00:23:42.047 --> 00:23:43.214 position:50% align:center
[LILITH, ASTAROTH]
New agents?

00:23:43.298 --> 00:23:46.176 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they're called F-Eighteen
and F-Nineteen.

00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:47.677 position:50% align:center
The weird thing is,

00:23:47.761 --> 00:23:50.764 position:50% align:center
F-Eighteen kinda smells like
a hero, if that makes sense.

00:23:50.847 --> 00:23:53.558 position:50% align:center
And F-Nineteen totally
feels like a mutant.

00:23:53.641 --> 00:23:56.061 position:50% align:center
Honestly. I always tell you
not to take in things

00:23:56.144 --> 00:23:58.897 position:50% align:center
that aren't dogs or cats,
but you never listen to me.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.231 position:50% align:center
I had no choice.

00:24:00.315 --> 00:24:02.359 position:50% align:center
I mean, they were throwin'
down in my front yard.

00:24:02.442 --> 00:24:04.527 position:50% align:center
[LILITH] Wait, why were they
there in the first place?

00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:05.820 position:50% align:center
No clue.

00:24:05.904 --> 00:24:07.572 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
Belial does have a big house.

00:24:07.655 --> 00:24:09.199 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
What's that have to do with it?
