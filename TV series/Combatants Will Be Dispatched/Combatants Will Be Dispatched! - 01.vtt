[ASTAROTH]
Combat Agent Six.

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:15.890 position:50% align:center
Ma'am!

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:17.142 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
Your assignment Is to be

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:19.894 position:50% align:center
the vanguard of the
Kisaragi Corporation.

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:22.063 position:50% align:center
Our advance man. Our spy.

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:23.148 position:50% align:center
Ma'am!

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:27.235 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
We've discovered several planets

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:28.987 position:50% align:center
in the known universe
that appear to be

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.322 position:50% align:center
extremely similar to Earth.

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:33.116 position:50% align:center
And we'll need you...

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:36.036 position:50% align:center
...to scout one of them.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:37.996 position:50% align:center
Ma'am!

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.707 position:50% align:center
Hmm? Huh?

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.709 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH BELIAL]
Now go forth, Agent Six!

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:45.879 position:50% align:center
Go forth and make our power
felt throughout the universe!

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:47.339 position:50% align:center
You're gonna have to do
this whole spiel again,

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:48.882 position:50% align:center
'cause I don't follow!

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:50.550 position:50% align:center
Exactly what
do you fail to grasp?

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:51.801 position:50% align:center
Uh, all of it?!

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.386 position:50% align:center
I mean, if people could
even go to other planets

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.930 position:50% align:center
in the first place,
I'd already be outta this dump

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:58.391 position:50% align:center
and chillin' on planet
TIG OL 'BITTIES!

00:00:58.475 --> 00:00:59.726 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.395 position:50% align:center
[SIX grunts] Okay, I've been
silent on the whole

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.357 position:50% align:center
tacky cosplay thing, and never
laughed at your corny titles.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.609 position:50% align:center
But this "power through
the universe" BS

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:09.194 position:50% align:center
is just a bridge too far!

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:11.529 position:50% align:center
What?! My uniform
isn't tacky cosplay!

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:13.198 position:50% align:center
Look! "Astaroth
the Ice Queen"

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:16.368 position:50% align:center
and "Belial the Great Flame"
are titles befitting two of

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:18.161 position:50% align:center
the three Supreme
leaders of Kisaragi!

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.622 position:50% align:center
There's absolutely nothing
"tacky" about them!

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:23.041 position:50% align:center
[SIX] C'mon, Yukari,
who're ya tryin' to fool?

00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:25.460 position:50% align:center
Like, what do your parents
think about all this stuff?

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:27.379 position:50% align:center
--[BELIAL whimpers]
--Ugh! No mention of parents

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.130 position:50% align:center
--or anyone's real names!
--[SIX] Hmph.

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:31.257 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
Listen well, Agent Six.

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:34.260 position:50% align:center
We are on the verge of
conquering this entire planet.

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:37.347 position:50% align:center
You do understand
that much of it, don't you?

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.683 position:50% align:center
Yeah, more or less.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.185 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] So, when that
conquest is fully complete,

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.646 position:50% align:center
what do you think happens
to you combat agents?

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.816 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] We become gods on
Earth and spend our days rolling

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.694 position:50% align:center
inside a soft, supple,
pit of hot lady flesh?

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:51.986 position:50% align:center
Imbecile!

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.988 position:50% align:center
You'll be cut
from the workforce!

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:55.490 position:50% align:center
You mean you'd
actually fire me?!

00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:56.491 position:50% align:center
That's right! 

00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:58.034 position:50% align:center
--[SIX growls]
--[gasps]

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.203 position:50% align:center
Hey! You made me go through
all those operations and stuff

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:03.540 position:50% align:center
so you can't just throw me
in the trash! You owe me!

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:04.833 position:50% align:center
At least let me
come live with you

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:06.835 position:50% align:center
and be your sexy
house-husband, okay?

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:08.044 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
I can explain everything,

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:10.255 position:50% align:center
--if you stop freaking out!
--[SIX screams]

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:15.593 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] Current space travel
technology hasn't taken us

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:17.178 position:50% align:center
any farther than the moon.

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:20.015 position:50% align:center
But our third supreme leader
and scientific genius,

00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:23.393 position:50% align:center
Lilith the Dark, has been
working on solving that issue.

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:24.936 position:50% align:center
Behold!

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.522 position:50% align:center
Feast your eyes on yet another
of my marvels of engineering

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:30.900 position:50% align:center
that may be the answer to every
problem facing humanity today!

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.652 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
So what is it, Lilith?

00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:35.947 position:50% align:center
Kinda looks like a teleporter
from an old timey sci-fi movie.

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:37.782 position:50% align:center
What a sharp observation.

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:39.868 position:50% align:center
Especially coming from
such a dull brain.

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:41.244 position:50% align:center
--[SIX growls]
--[BELIAL, ASTAROTH] Hmph!

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:44.164 position:50% align:center
And lurking behind it
is yet another masterpiece.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:46.583 position:50% align:center
Alice, come here.

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:57.469 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Huh? Huh?!
Uh, so who's the brat?

00:02:57.552 --> 00:02:59.471 position:50% align:center
I am not just some "brat."

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:01.639 position:50% align:center
Mind your tone around
your betters, lowbie.

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:03.558 position:50% align:center
Eh? What the--?

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:05.727 position:50% align:center
You'd better watch your tone
'cause a combat agent

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.646 position:50% align:center
for an evil organization
is not above hurting kids!

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.274 position:50% align:center
Oh. So much as lay
a finger on me,

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.777 position:50% align:center
and my core reactor will melt
down and vaporize everything

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.947 position:50% align:center
within a wide radius. But if
that's not a problem, proceed.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
As I was saying, my official
designation isn't that

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:24.746 position:50% align:center
of a child. It's "Kisaragi High
Spec Pretty Girl Android."

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:25.830 position:50% align:center
Really...?

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:28.333 position:50% align:center
Indeed it is. This is Alice,

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:31.795 position:50% align:center
a high-spec android created to
provide you critical support.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.130 position:50% align:center
I've been informed that
you're a complete moron.

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.632 position:50% align:center
So allow me to do
all the thinking

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.050 position:50% align:center
once our mission begins.

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:39.177 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but the last thing
I need is a mouthy little

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.429 position:50% align:center
walking time-bomb
sidekick, okay?

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:44.849 position:50% align:center
Any other weapons or additional
items you may require

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:46.518 position:50% align:center
can be obtained
with a written request

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.395 position:50% align:center
via this miniature teleporter.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:51.272 position:50% align:center
Your chips will
send us your coordinates.

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.817 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] You will have
two primary objectives.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.819 position:50% align:center
First, to secure a base.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.529 position:50% align:center
There, you'll
assemble a teleporter

00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:00.407 position:50% align:center
for two-way travel with Earth.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.701 position:50% align:center
Secondly, to survey the planet.

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.494 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
Your subjects are wide-ranging:

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:07.497 position:50% align:center
military threats, natural
resources, things of that sort.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.416 position:50% align:center
If conditions are favorable,
we'll solve both

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.919 position:50% align:center
our environmental and food
supply crises in one fell swoop.

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.796 position:50% align:center
Hold up, this is
actually some kinda

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.923 position:50% align:center
big-deal-the-future-of-
Earth-is-at-stake-mission

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:18.842 position:50% align:center
you're sending me on.

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:21.553 position:50% align:center
Indeed, failure
is not an option.

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:24.431 position:50% align:center
You're trusting the fate
of the whole world, to me?

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:27.183 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
Well, um... Agent Six...

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:31.438 position:50% align:center
I've known you... ever since
Kisaragi Corporation

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.148 position:50% align:center
was founded.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
I consider you to be...

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:41.990 position:50% align:center
To be like another one of
Kisaragi's Supreme Leaders.

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:45.410 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Hmm. A lot of
crazy stuff has happened,

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:48.830 position:50% align:center
but I've enjoyed myself.
And the time we've spent

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:51.833 position:50% align:center
building the
corporation together.

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:54.711 position:50% align:center
I don't know what'll happen
on this alien world,

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:57.505 position:50% align:center
but I'll do the best I
can to come back.

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:00.925 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH gasps]
You dummy. You realize...

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.054 position:50% align:center
...you're supposed to promise
that you'll come back.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.222 position:50% align:center
What's more, you'll be
required to send us

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.725 position:50% align:center
detailed weekly reports.

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:10.935 position:50% align:center
Let us know that
the mission is proceeding,

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50% align:center
and that you're doing well.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.856 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Astaroth...

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.067 position:50% align:center
Can I give you
a big hug before I go?!

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.193 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:19.736 position:50% align:center
Why not go for a kiss, instead?

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:20.820 position:50% align:center
--[ASTAROTH gasps]
--[LILITH giggles]

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:21.863 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
I can?! You're into it, right?!

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:23.573 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:24.866 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Oh, yeah!

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.618 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
No way! Ugh!

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.244 position:50% align:center
[SIX grunts]

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.163 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:32.749 position:50% align:center
[LILITH] Well, then. In lieu
of a sentimental send-off,

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:35.251 position:50% align:center
how about we just zip you and
Alice there straight away?

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.462 position:50% align:center
[SIX groans]
Fine, I'm going.

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
It's an honor to be chosen
to go to another planet

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.926 position:50% align:center
as the designated representative
for the Kisaragi Corporation!

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.095 position:50% align:center
Sure, whatever, because
when Astaroth rolled the dice

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:46.304 position:50% align:center
to decide who--

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:47.847 position:50% align:center
--Lilith, begin teleportation!
--[SIX] Eh?

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.767 position:50% align:center
On it! Teleportation...

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.352 position:50% align:center
...Engage!

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:57.065 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm actually a little
bit nervous about this.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:59.317 position:50% align:center
What's there to be
nervous about, lowbie?

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:02.028 position:50% align:center
Even if things do go wrong out
there, don't you have a backup?

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:04.531 position:50% align:center
We humans can't just reload
our brains into a new body

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:07.367 position:50% align:center
like you creepy little
robots, ya know?

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.369 position:50% align:center
Let go of my face.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:11.496 position:50% align:center
[SIX] I'm not all
that worried, though.

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:13.707 position:50% align:center
After all, a mega genius
like "Lilith the Dark"

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.584 position:50% align:center
doesn't make junk, right? Eh?

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:18.962 position:50% align:center
By the way, what is the success
rate for the teleporter?

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.131 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you've
run a lot of tests.

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:24.009 position:50% align:center
As of now, the success
rate is sitting at 100%,

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:25.885 position:50% align:center
and that is all
you need to know.

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:29.431 position:50% align:center
Uh. But you've tested it out
a buncha times though, right?

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:32.100 position:50% align:center
Perhaps I should put it
this way, Agent Six:

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:34.769 position:50% align:center
If I ran a lot of experiments
and one failed,

00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:37.897 position:50% align:center
well... the success rate
would fall below 100.

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:39.357 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Uh. Yeah, I think
I'm gonna have to

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:40.900 position:50% align:center
back out now, sorry.

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:42.610 position:50% align:center
[LILITH] I'm almost positive
that you'll come back

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:44.029 position:50% align:center
--in one piece!
--Huh?!

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:45.780 position:50% align:center
Ready? And...

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:48.366 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Wait! You're not
a genius, you're just a nutjob!

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.536 position:50% align:center
I can overlook your rudeness.
I know you're scared!

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:53.246 position:50% align:center
Now get going, Agent six!

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:56.249 position:50% align:center
[SIX gasps]

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:58.084 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:00.670 position:50% align:center
Aw, damn it,
you're gonna kill me!

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:01.921 position:50% align:center
Mark my words!

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:05.425 position:50% align:center
If I do make it back,
I'll have my revenge!

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:09.763 position:50% align:center
--[ASTAROTH, BELIAL gasp]
--[LILITH] Hmm!

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:21.191 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap!
I knew they were gonna kill me!

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:23.109 position:50% align:center
I'll have to come back as
a ghost and haunt 'em,

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:24.361 position:50% align:center
but I don't wanna die!

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:25.737 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
We're about 30,000 meters

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.238 position:50% align:center
from the planet's surface.

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:28.948 position:50% align:center
Earlier, you said you were
high-spec, didn't you, Alice?!

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:31.076 position:50% align:center
That means you can turn
into a jet or something, right?!

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:32.660 position:50% align:center
Tell me you've
got a flight mode!

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:34.245 position:50% align:center
No, but with my
self-destruct mode,

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:36.081 position:50% align:center
I can turn us into
a cloud of ashes.

00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:37.874 position:50% align:center
That won't save me!

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:40.043 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Villains always
have a self-destruct.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
Here, take this parachute.

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.672 position:50% align:center
[SIX whimpering]

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:45.924 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Don't screw up
the landing, or I'll explode

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:47.967 position:50% align:center
and vaporize everything
within a wide radius,

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:50.178 position:50% align:center
which would be a setback.

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:52.222 position:50% align:center
[SIX] It's risky just to go on
a walk around the block

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:54.182 position:50% align:center
with you, isn't it?

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:56.184 position:50% align:center
--Holy crap!
--[ALICE] Hmm?

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:58.144 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Check out that city!

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:04.859 position:50% align:center
[SIX panting] Well, I say screw
securing a "base."

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:07.570 position:50% align:center
We'll slap the teleporter
together here and head back!

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:09.072 position:50% align:center
To make it up to me,

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:11.616 position:50% align:center
those girls are gonna have
do some real humiliating stuff!

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.035 position:50% align:center
You can't build it out
in the elements like this.

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:15.995 position:50% align:center
It is an incredibly
delicate device.

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:17.247 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.623 position:50% align:center
What's more, it's going
to take about a month

00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:21.459 position:50% align:center
for the phase space
to fully stabilize.

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:23.461 position:50% align:center
It wouldn't even work right now.

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:26.923 position:50% align:center
Ugh... It won't work
for a freakin' month?!

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:28.967 position:50% align:center
Why do they always
pull crap like--

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.510 position:50% align:center
Hey! What the hell was that?!

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:33.513 position:50% align:center
I injected you with nanomachines
to boost your immune system

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.807 position:50% align:center
and protect you from diseases.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.726 position:50% align:center
I can tell that you're
out of sorts right now,

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.769 position:50% align:center
but we have
located civilization.

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:43.940 position:50% align:center
That's a positive development.
I suggest we go there at once.

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
Hey! Grr! Hold on a second--

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.195 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Similarity to Earth was a factor

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.906 position:50% align:center
in choosing this planet. So
there is a rather good chance

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.659 position:50% align:center
that there are Homo Sapiens
like you running the place.

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:56.327 position:50% align:center
Ugh, I don't wanna
walk that far,

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:58.663 position:50% align:center
so can we ask for a
buggy or something?

00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:00.623 position:50% align:center
If we need anything,
we can just shoot a request

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:02.125 position:50% align:center
with this, can't we?

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:05.795 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Agent Six, how many
Evil Points do you have?

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:09.299 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Hmm... Somewhere in the
neighborhood of 300 or so.

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:10.842 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Three hundred?

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:12.469 position:50% align:center
That's not nearly enough
for the two of us

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.512 position:50% align:center
to conquer a
fortress like that.

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:15.972 position:50% align:center
Request denied.

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:17.390 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Now wait a damn minute.

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:20.560 position:50% align:center
We gotta use our own Evil Points
to get stuff sent to us?

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:22.645 position:50% align:center
I spent a lot of time doing
low-level evil deeds

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:23.897 position:50% align:center
just to save up this many!

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.815 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Just how thick
is that skull of yours?

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:28.610 position:50% align:center
Evil Points aren't some
kind of fun little bonus.

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:31.654 position:50% align:center
All Kisaragi employees are
required to get a chip implanted

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:33.865 position:50% align:center
in their brain as
a condition of employment.

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:36.117 position:50% align:center
The chips detect any
evil acts they perform,

00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:37.786 position:50% align:center
and give an appropriate
number of points

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:38.870 position:50% align:center
depending on the action.

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
[VOICE 1A]
You earned Evil Points!

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.208 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah, rust bucket!
I am aware of that!

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
So what exactly have you
been using your points on

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:47.462 position:50% align:center
up till now? You're
supposed to trade them

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:49.673 position:50% align:center
for better equipment
to make yourself stronger

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:51.549 position:50% align:center
or improve your
overall performance.

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:52.842 position:50% align:center
[SIX groans]

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.427 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] You probably trade
them for pornography

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:56.930 position:50% align:center
and then report it as
"necessary materials,"

00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:59.140 position:50% align:center
but your status is
the only thing not rising.

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:01.142 position:50% align:center
[SIX] How dare you be right
and also--shut up?

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:03.103 position:50% align:center
Anyways, my point is,
instead of being stingy,

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:04.896 position:50% align:center
they should just
send us better stuff!

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:08.525 position:50% align:center
Then, the great Agent Six,
would be able to take down any--

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:12.654 position:50% align:center
[SIX screams] You liar!
You said this planet was

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:15.156 position:50% align:center
a lot like Earth, but we don't
have any face-eating dinosaur

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.616 position:50% align:center
devil dogs running around!

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.201 position:50% align:center
Crap! Crap! Crap!

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center

--[blaster zapping]

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:26.710 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] There are lots
of them. Better not miss.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.753 position:50% align:center
Why's a robot using
a human like a shield?!

00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:31.715 position:50% align:center
I'm a high-spec android,
designed with realism in mind,

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:33.341 position:50% align:center
so I've been given
the combat prowess of

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:35.218 position:50% align:center
an average young girl.

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:39.472 position:50% align:center

In other words, you're useless!

It's tryin' to eat me!
This thing's as strong as I am!

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.693 position:50% align:center
Oh? It's as strong as
an agent who's undergone

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:54.654 position:50% align:center
bodily enhancement and equipped
with powerful armor, huh?

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:56.364 position:50% align:center
The life forms here
are quite formidable.

00:10:56.448 --> 00:10:58.366 position:50% align:center
So instead of sitting
on your can and watching,

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.909 position:50% align:center
help me with a plan!

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:02.078 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I'm a "rust-bucket,"
so I can't think of anything.

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:03.913 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I'm useless, Agent Six.

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:06.082 position:50% align:center
Just do something
before it eats me!

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:07.584 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:10.503 position:50% align:center
I take back what I said before,
you're not a rust bucket!

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:12.881 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] That's better, now you
need use your Evil Points

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:15.633 position:50% align:center
to procure me a shotgun.
Then I can help you.

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:17.802 position:50% align:center
Fine! I'll do whatever,
just hurry!

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:22.432 position:50% align:center

Uh, so Alice,
what do ya say we do?

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:46.873 position:50% align:center
Right now, we just need
to let her talk a bit more.

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.291 position:50% align:center
[SIX] But I don't understand
a word she--

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:49.501 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
...what language is that?

00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:51.753 position:50% align:center
I've never seen
that armor before.

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:53.129 position:50% align:center

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:54.881 position:50% align:center

For some reason,
I'm able to understand her.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:04.265 position:50% align:center

and now I've leveled up my game

00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50% align:center
without even trying?

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:07.602 position:50% align:center
I know comprehension
isn't your forte,

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:10.021 position:50% align:center
but what's really happening,
is I'm sending my translation

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:13.024 position:50% align:center
of her language directly
to your brain via the chip.

00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:15.402 position:50% align:center
Huh?! The chip can
really do that?!

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:17.821 position:50% align:center
Nobody told me!
That is so creepy!

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:20.657 position:50% align:center
Anyway. Just leave
everything to me.

Uh?

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:27.497 position:50% align:center

in a land far, far away.

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:31.418 position:50% align:center
He was a leader
of great soldiers

and a noble protector
of the people!

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
But sadly... while he was
saving me from the clutches

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
of a vile brute, he suffered
a terrible head injury

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.553 position:50% align:center
which caused massive
brain damage!

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:42.929 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:45.056 position:50% align:center

made up, backstory?

Listen up, Six.
You're incredibly dumb,

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:49.102 position:50% align:center
and would screw up any story
you'd need to maintain,

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:51.688 position:50% align:center
but now, no one will
expect any intelligence.

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:52.689 position:50% align:center
It's for the best.

00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:56.234 position:50% align:center
What's this? What are
you people even saying?

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:57.652 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me!

00:12:57.736 --> 00:12:59.571 position:50% align:center
But it does tend to soothe
him when I speak to him

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:01.322 position:50% align:center
in our mother tongue.

00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:04.492 position:50% align:center
If you've traveled all this way,
then where are your belongings?

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:06.369 position:50% align:center
He's on a journey
to find himself anew--

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:08.788 position:50% align:center
to heal his mind and
repair his tattered soul!

00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:11.416 position:50% align:center
But we were attacked by
terrifying beasts in the forest

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:14.627 position:50% align:center
and had to leave all
of our possessions behind.

00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:16.254 position:50% align:center
Well. I'll admit, at first,

00:13:16.338 --> 00:13:19.049 position:50% align:center
I thought you two were
bandits or fugitives.

00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:22.594 position:50% align:center
I apologize for being so harsh
with you, but that is my job.

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:23.595 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:25.013 position:50% align:center
By the way,

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:27.349 position:50% align:center
it's hard to believe you
made it through the Darkwood.

00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:29.351 position:50% align:center
But hearing your story
and seeing all this

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
does explain things.

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:34.564 position:50% align:center
You must be quite powerful.

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.149 position:50% align:center
My name's Snow,

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
and I am a commander in the
Kingdom of Grace's royal guard.

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:41.071 position:50% align:center
If you're short on funds,
I'm sure I can help

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:43.031 position:50% align:center
find some work for you.

00:13:43.114 --> 00:13:45.241 position:50% align:center
I appreciate your generosity,
Commander Snow!

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:46.951 position:50% align:center
Of course, I'm honored
to welcome you

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:48.912 position:50% align:center
on behalf of the kingdom.

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:52.040 position:50% align:center
Clearly, our meeting
today was fate.

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:54.084 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:01.466 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] I am Snow, personal
knight to Princess Tillis,

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:03.468 position:50% align:center
and commander of
the royal guard!

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.928 position:50% align:center
Open the gate!

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:11.059 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:15.188 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Uh. Yo Snow, what's
the deal with that up there?

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:17.857 position:50% align:center
It looks like some
kinda beat up old tank.

00:14:17.941 --> 00:14:19.067 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
A tank?

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.903 position:50% align:center
You mean you're
familiar with this artifact?

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:23.530 position:50% align:center
It's an ancient weapon.

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:26.032 position:50% align:center
Long ago, it protected our
kingdom from destruction

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:27.826 position:50% align:center
by a giant demon beast.

00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:30.537 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I'll need to
investigate this further.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.289 position:50% align:center
Preservation magic
was used on it,

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.500 position:50% align:center
but the years have
still taken their toll.

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:36.751 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Magic?

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:39.629 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] Mm. Yes.
Unfortunately, I can't use it.

00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:42.215 position:50% align:center
Only a select few have
the talent for magic.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.092 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
The talent for magic...

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:47.429 position:50% align:center
Explosion!

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:50.724 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] This is because
of that head trauma

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:53.018 position:50% align:center
you mentioned before, isn't it?

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:55.228 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Best to just ignore it.

00:14:57.564 --> 00:14:59.149 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS]
Welcome back, Snow.

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.776 position:50% align:center
I appreciate you
taking that mission.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.695 position:50% align:center
But who have you
brought here with you?

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Combat Agent Six.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.907 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] And I'm High-Spec
Pretty Girl Android,

00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:09.701 position:50% align:center
Alice Kisaragi.

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:11.369 position:50% align:center
Um. You sure that you
wanna keep rolling with

00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:14.330 position:50% align:center
this whole "high-spec,
pretty girl" bit? It's dumb.

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:16.291 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] So you were born
"Combat Agent Six,"

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:18.126 position:50% align:center
or have you just forgotten
what your real name is?

00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:20.420 position:50% align:center
Both of you need to bow!

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:23.048 position:50% align:center
Don't you realize that you're
in the presence of royalty?!

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.592 position:50% align:center
Princess Cristoseles
Tillis Grace!

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:27.552 position:50% align:center
--[SIX] Crazy name.
--Watch your tongue!

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:30.388 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS giggles]
You can just call me Tillis.

00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:32.807 position:50% align:center
--Ooh. Ya see, Alice?
--[SNOW] Lower your heads!

00:15:32.891 --> 00:15:34.684 position:50% align:center
Now this is what an actual
pretty girl looks like.

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:36.436 position:50% align:center
--Stop talking!
--[ALICE] In case you haven't

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.271 position:50% align:center
figured it out yet,
the princess giggled because

00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:40.440 position:50% align:center
she's amused by your stupidity.

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:41.900 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:44.611 position:50% align:center
You are definitely not from
anywhere near my kingdom.

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:47.155 position:50% align:center
Nobody who knew of my reputation
would ever dream of

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:49.199 position:50% align:center
behaving in such a way.

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:51.284 position:50% align:center
Correct, Snow?

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:52.744 position:50% align:center
Yes, Your Highness.

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:54.829 position:50% align:center
In fact, they tell me that
they have traveled here

00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:56.164 position:50% align:center
through the Darkwood.

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:57.499 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:59.125 position:50% align:center
And it appeared that they
had slain a great number

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:01.878 position:50% align:center
of Deadly Heggs, so they
must be capable fighters,

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:03.171 position:50% align:center
at the very least.

00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:05.674 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I've led a crap ton
of combat agents

00:16:05.757 --> 00:16:08.968 position:50% align:center
on some super dangerous missions
all over the world. Ma'am.

00:16:09.052 --> 00:16:12.138 position:50% align:center
Agent Six, the Kingdom
is currently engaged in war

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:15.809 position:50% align:center
with the demons, and we sorely
lack for knights and commanders.

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:17.143 position:50% align:center
Demons?

00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:18.645 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS] The Demon Lord
in the neighboring kingdom

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:21.398 position:50% align:center
declared war on us
without any warning.

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:24.275 position:50% align:center
Well, that's a huge plot twist.
What they want?

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:26.194 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS]
He likely wants our land.

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.988 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] Year after year,
a massive demon beast called

00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:32.117 position:50% align:center
the Sand King turns more of
their country into desert.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.786 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS] The Demon Army is
filled with powerful warriors,

00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:37.163 position:50% align:center
and I'm afraid our chances
of victory are slim.

00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:40.000 position:50% align:center
Oh, Agent Six! I beg of you!

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:42.919 position:50% align:center
Please help and
save our kingdom!

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:44.921 position:50% align:center
[SNOW sighs] I get that
you're not from around here,

00:16:45.005 --> 00:16:47.257 position:50% align:center
but can you please
try to control yourself?

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.508 position:50% align:center
I brought you to the castle,

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:50.635 position:50% align:center
and I don't want that
to reflect poorly on me!

00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:54.055 position:50% align:center
Please forgive us, Lady Snow!
Agent Six may be a bit uncouth,

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:55.932 position:50% align:center
but he is a
professional fighter!

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:58.101 position:50% align:center
I swear, he'll prove
his worth in battle!

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:00.645 position:50% align:center
And I am positive that his
accomplishments will be a credit

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:02.772 position:50% align:center
to your judgment
and boost your status.

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:03.940 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:06.317 position:50% align:center
Oh! So that was
your plan all along, huh?

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:07.986 position:50% align:center
You tried to convince us
you wanted to "help us"

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.529 position:50% align:center
out of the goodness
of your heart,

00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:11.865 position:50% align:center
but the truth is, you were just
in desperate need for a guy

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:14.701 position:50% align:center
with killer battle skills and
an incredibly sexy body!

00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:15.994 position:50% align:center
I don't want your body!

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:17.829 position:50% align:center
But I'll level with you, okay?

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:20.373 position:50% align:center
I like money and glory
and a finely crafted sword

00:17:20.457 --> 00:17:24.461 position:50% align:center
more than anything else
in the world! Hey, Agent Six.

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:26.796 position:50% align:center
I've got a sneaking suspicion
that you feel the same way

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.173 position:50% align:center
as I do.

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:30.967 position:50% align:center
Now, I'm in an extremely
high position here.

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:33.136 position:50% align:center
If somebody tries
to pick on you newbies,

00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:35.472 position:50% align:center
I won't mind using my clout
as royal guard commander

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:36.848 position:50% align:center
to crush them.

00:17:36.931 --> 00:17:37.974 position:50% align:center
You see?

00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:40.101 position:50% align:center
Both our interests
line up pretty well.

00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:42.228 position:50% align:center
I'm not like you,
you two-faced wench!

00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:44.731 position:50% align:center
Say what?! How dare you
speak so disrespectfully

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:47.484 position:50% align:center
to a decorated commander
of the royal guard!

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:50.278 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Lady Snow,
what might this object be?

00:17:50.362 --> 00:17:52.864 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] Oh, this is
a legendary-class artifact

00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:55.700 position:50% align:center
that can cause the rain to fall.

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:57.952 position:50% align:center
Every year, during the
dry season, a member of

00:17:58.036 --> 00:18:00.622 position:50% align:center
the royal family offers
words of prayer to it,

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:02.540 position:50% align:center
and lo and behold,
the rain comes.

00:18:02.624 --> 00:18:04.417 position:50% align:center
But it hasn't worked
in quite a while,

00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:07.504 position:50% align:center
so we've been forced to buy
water from other countries.

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:10.340 position:50% align:center
I believe that I can make it
work once again for you.

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:12.008 position:50% align:center
Wait. Seriously?!

00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:13.885 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] So... do you mind
if I open it up?

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:16.805 position:50% align:center
Of course not!
Even if you can't fix it,

00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:19.849 position:50% align:center
I'll take full responsibility,
but do you think you can?

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:21.893 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Yeah. I'm pretty
sure this'll work.

00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:24.604 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] Yay! I'll go
share the good news!

00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:27.649 position:50% align:center
[SNOW giggles]

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:29.901 position:50% align:center
Hey, Alice! Agent Six!

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:32.070 position:50% align:center
We'll all share in
the glory, won't we?

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:33.697 position:50% align:center
Sound good to you?!

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.573 position:50% align:center
[laughs maniacally]

00:18:35.657 --> 00:18:37.117 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
"Share the glory"?

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.120 position:50% align:center
She didn't even do anything.

00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:42.414 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Yeah, well,
neither did you, actually.

00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:43.665 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Ah?!

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:45.500 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Okay, that should do it.

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:48.712 position:50% align:center
Now, the only thing
left to do, is reboot.

Check this out, Alice.

00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:16.531 position:50% align:center
The royal family's gonna
have to say this in front of

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:18.616 position:50% align:center
the whole kingdom.

[SIX]
Every time they need rain,

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:31.338 position:50% align:center
I'll get to see those soft
cheeks of hers turn red,

00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:33.631 position:50% align:center
plus, I'll rack up
the Evil Points!

00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:35.175 position:50% align:center
You idiot.

00:19:35.258 --> 00:19:38.011 position:50% align:center
You realize Tillis isn't the
only member of the royal family.

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:39.262 position:50% align:center
[KING]
Dick Festival!

[CITIZENS gasping, screaming]

00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:43.308 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] That means, what you
and everyone else will see

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
is an old man shout a password
that sounds like

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.771 position:50% align:center
a second-grader
came up with it.

00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:49.356 position:50% align:center
Aw, man.

00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:52.359 position:50% align:center
I'm starting to feel like that
might've kinda been a mistake.

00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:54.986 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS giggles]

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:59.115 position:50% align:center
Excuse me. What mistake
might that be, Agent Six?

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:01.326 position:50% align:center
[VOICE 1A]
You earned Evil Points!

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:05.747 position:50% align:center
[ADVISOR 1A]
Whisper, whisper...

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.374 position:50% align:center
"Dick festival."

00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center
[KING] Hmm. Well, that
is unbelievably indecent.

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:11.419 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Holy crap, Alice,
that guy's got a beard

00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:13.338 position:50% align:center
that Santa Claus would kill for.

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center
Do you think he'd get mad
at me if I asked to touch it?

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:17.717 position:50% align:center
Silence! That's
the king, you fool!

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:20.887 position:50% align:center
Agent Six. Admittedly,
I fail to understand

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.223 position:50% align:center
why you would do
something so asinine,

00:20:23.306 --> 00:20:24.974 position:50% align:center
but since you did
repair the artifact,

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:28.770 position:50% align:center
I suppose it's only fair this
transgression be forgiven.

00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:29.854 position:50% align:center
Now, begone from my sight--

00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:32.232 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS]
Wait, Father. If I may.

00:20:32.315 --> 00:20:34.776 position:50% align:center
Before he departs, I'd like
to personally take this man

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:36.778 position:50% align:center
into my service.

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:38.154 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:40.907 position:50% align:center
Highness. It's dangerous
to put your trust in someone

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.826 position:50% align:center
you know nothing about!

00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:44.285 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS]
We simply cannot afford to lose

00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:45.912 position:50% align:center
their strength or wisdom.

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:47.372 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF OF STAFF]
Hmm?!

00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:49.541 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS]
Father, will you allow it?

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:51.835 position:50% align:center
Oh. Well. I, uh...

00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:54.129 position:50% align:center
If you think it's
a good idea, Tillis.

00:20:54.212 --> 00:20:55.755 position:50% align:center
You know I trust you, dear.

00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:58.466 position:50% align:center
See that? It appears as though
Princess Tillis is the one

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:01.011 position:50% align:center
who's actually
running this kingdom.

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:03.596 position:50% align:center
The king is a loser who lets
his daughter steamroll him.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.848 position:50% align:center
--Silence!
--Copy that.

00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:07.058 position:50% align:center
So we just brown-nose her, then?
Piece of cake!

00:21:07.142 --> 00:21:08.226 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:09.436 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS]
Now.

00:21:09.519 --> 00:21:12.022 position:50% align:center
Since I have Father's
express permission,

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:13.857 position:50% align:center
you'll be working
directly for me.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.775 position:50% align:center
How's that sound?

00:21:15.859 --> 00:21:18.611 position:50% align:center
Well, I can't turn down
a request from a princess!

00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:20.280 position:50% align:center
I'm not just going along
with all of this because

00:21:20.363 --> 00:21:22.532 position:50% align:center
you're a total smoke show,
you understand?

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:24.492 position:50% align:center
You're a bad actor and a creep.

00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:25.994 position:50% align:center
--[SIX] Hmm!
--[TILLIS giggles]

00:21:26.077 --> 00:21:28.455 position:50% align:center
Your Highness!
Please reconsider!

00:21:28.538 --> 00:21:30.457 position:50% align:center
After they desecrated
our precious artifact,

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.917 position:50% align:center
I'm beginning to think
these two might be spies!

00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:35.045 position:50% align:center
So that would also mean
that you're a traitor who let

00:21:35.128 --> 00:21:37.297 position:50% align:center
a couple of spies
infiltrate the kingdom!

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.632 position:50% align:center
Me, a traitor?!
That's just ridiculous!

00:21:39.716 --> 00:21:41.676 position:50% align:center
Everyone knows there's no one
more loyal to Princess Tillis

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.013 position:50% align:center
than me, and I would never
dream of betraying her!

00:21:45.096 --> 00:21:47.682 position:50% align:center
If I must, I'll take my burning
blade, "Flame Zapper,"

00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:49.351 position:50% align:center
and strike you down right here!

00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:53.104 position:50% align:center
In case you missed it, I work
for the princess now, too, so...

00:21:53.188 --> 00:21:55.398 position:50% align:center
I don't think she'll appreciate
you killing me, do you?

00:21:55.482 --> 00:21:57.192 position:50% align:center
--[SNOW groans]
--Did you forget?

00:21:57.275 --> 00:21:58.985 position:50% align:center
There was something else
that you said you'd be doing,

00:21:59.069 --> 00:22:00.528 position:50% align:center
if I'm not mistaken.

00:22:00.612 --> 00:22:03.198 position:50% align:center
[SNOW gulps]
And what was that, exactly...?

00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:06.409 position:50% align:center
Heh... "I'll take
full responsibility."

00:22:06.493 --> 00:22:08.787 position:50% align:center
That's what you said, right?
Which means...

[wheeze]

[SNOW] As of today, "Sir"
Combat Agent Six is recognized

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.516 position:50% align:center
as an honorable knight
of the kingdom of Grace.

00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:32.394 position:50% align:center
Your role will be to lead
an interceptor group.

00:22:32.477 --> 00:22:35.855 position:50% align:center
What? You mean I won't be
guarding the princess?

00:22:35.939 --> 00:22:38.024 position:50% align:center
That was my superior's decision.

00:22:38.108 --> 00:22:41.319 position:50% align:center
And I will be serving as
your unit's executive officer,

00:22:41.403 --> 00:22:44.447 position:50% align:center
as well as your
personal assistant.

00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:45.990 position:50% align:center
But I don't think of you
as my leader!

00:22:46.074 --> 00:22:47.784 position:50% align:center
Nor do I trust you
in the slightest!

00:22:47.867 --> 00:22:49.577 position:50% align:center
So if you've got something
else up your sleeve,

00:22:49.661 --> 00:22:50.704 position:50% align:center
you might as well confess!

00:22:50.787 --> 00:22:53.248 position:50% align:center
Because I will find out,
you understand?!

00:22:53.331 --> 00:22:55.500 position:50% align:center
I get that you're upset right
now, and you're yelling because

00:22:55.583 --> 00:22:56.876 position:50% align:center
you were forced
to take responsibility

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.877 position:50% align:center
and it got you demoted.

00:22:57.961 --> 00:22:59.170 position:50% align:center
--Too bad.
--So sad.

00:22:59.254 --> 00:23:01.131 position:50% align:center
I'll have you know,
I wasn't demoted!

00:23:01.214 --> 00:23:04.300 position:50% align:center
No! You're suspicious
and my job is to watch you!

00:23:04.384 --> 00:23:05.635 position:50% align:center
[ALICE, SIX]
Hmm?

00:23:05.719 --> 00:23:07.220 position:50% align:center
You go on ahead and
keep telling yourself that,

00:23:07.303 --> 00:23:09.264 position:50% align:center
if that's how you can
still sleep at night.

00:23:09.347 --> 00:23:11.391 position:50% align:center
It's delusional.
That "artifact" thing

00:23:11.474 --> 00:23:14.185 position:50% align:center
you helped defile was
a national treasure, was it not?

00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:15.478 position:50% align:center
--[SNOW gasps]
--And I'm pretty sure,

00:23:15.562 --> 00:23:17.897 position:50% align:center
normally, that would
trigger the death penalty.

00:23:17.981 --> 00:23:20.400 position:50% align:center
If you think they rewarded you
with an important job instead,

00:23:20.483 --> 00:23:21.443 position:50% align:center
you're just stupid.

00:23:21.526 --> 00:23:24.320 position:50% align:center
Eh--! Whoa, Alice?!
Come on!

00:23:24.404 --> 00:23:26.698 position:50% align:center
I don't understand why you'd
choose to talk to me like that!

00:23:26.781 --> 00:23:28.408 position:50% align:center
Obviously, it's because
you've been mouthing off

00:23:28.491 --> 00:23:31.536 position:50% align:center
to your superior officer,
the esteemed Agent Six.

00:23:31.619 --> 00:23:34.706 position:50% align:center
You're nothing but a failure.
And a fraud.

00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:38.960 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
H-How dare you...?!

00:23:52.432 --> 00:23:54.726 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL]
I'm totes jealous of Agent Six.

00:23:54.809 --> 00:23:56.853 position:50% align:center
I knew that I should've
loaded these stupid dice

00:23:56.936 --> 00:23:59.773 position:50% align:center
so my number would
come up instead of his.

00:23:59.856 --> 00:24:01.691 position:50% align:center
A one or two
would mean Astaroth.

00:24:01.775 --> 00:24:03.401 position:50% align:center
Three or four would be me.

00:24:03.485 --> 00:24:06.821 position:50% align:center
Five was Lilith.
And six, was Six!

00:24:08.406 --> 00:24:09.949 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL] I mean, we were gonna
have to assign the mission

00:24:10.033 --> 00:24:11.785 position:50% align:center
to somebody we could trust.

00:24:11.868 --> 00:24:13.495 position:50% align:center
But we still picked
with a dice roll.

00:24:13.578 --> 00:24:16.414 position:50% align:center
Somebody was quite upset
when Six's number came up.

00:24:16.498 --> 00:24:18.416 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] This is a major
mission and Agent Six

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.959 position:50% align:center
is the weakest one of us.

00:24:20.043 --> 00:24:22.420 position:50% align:center
So it's only natural that
I be a little worried, right?

00:24:22.504 --> 00:24:23.421 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL]
Yeah, whatever.

00:24:23.505 --> 00:24:25.215 position:50% align:center
But if he does
happen to succeed,

00:24:25.298 --> 00:24:27.300 position:50% align:center
he'll get promoted
to Supreme Leader, won't he?

00:24:27.384 --> 00:24:29.260 position:50% align:center
Then maybe we could call
ourselves something cool

00:24:29.344 --> 00:24:30.720 position:50% align:center
like the "Elite Four"!

00:24:30.804 --> 00:24:35.100 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH sighs] Yeah. I really
hope Agent Six succeeds,

00:24:35.183 --> 00:24:36.893 position:50% align:center
and I hope he reports in soon.

00:24:36.976 --> 00:24:39.020 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL, LILITH guffawing]
