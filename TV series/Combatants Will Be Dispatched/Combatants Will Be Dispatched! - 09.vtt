So, there really
are plants out here.

00:00:20.604 --> 00:00:23.148 position:50% align:center
Surprised they can
survive in this desert.

00:00:23.232 --> 00:00:25.734 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] After we grab these nuts
and solve the water crisis,

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:27.194 position:50% align:center
we're the kingdom's new heroes!

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:30.656 position:50% align:center
And the Princess will be sure
to give me my job back!

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.575 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Hmm... These nuts
are pretty tiny.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:36.203 position:50% align:center
Could they really have enough
juice in 'em to matter?

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:39.331 position:50% align:center
Sure. The water's supposedly
compressed with magic.

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:41.792 position:50% align:center
Wild.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.544 position:50% align:center
Again with the magic talk.

00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:46.296 position:50% align:center
Every time you make a reference
to that bogus occult crap,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.173 position:50% align:center
it feels like
a spiteful-if-futile attempt

00:00:48.257 --> 00:00:49.633 position:50% align:center
to deny my existence.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.010 position:50% align:center
Do you still not believe
in magic after all this time,

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:53.554 position:50% align:center
you silly girl?

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:56.390 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'll be punished for
your blasphemy soon enough.

[ALICE growls]

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.102 position:50% align:center
I'm starting to smell some
deliciously powerful magic

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.938 position:50% align:center
all of a sudden,
and a whole bunch of meat, too!

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:04.273 position:50% align:center
Stop talkin' like that.

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:06.233 position:50% align:center
Every time you start,
somethin' bad ha-

[GROUP gasping]

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:09.194 position:50% align:center
An earthquake?

00:01:09.278 --> 00:01:12.281 position:50% align:center
Behold! This is Lord
Zenarith's punishment!

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:15.826 position:50% align:center
Now tell your Big Sis Grimm
how sorry you are!

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:18.245 position:50% align:center
[GROUP groans]

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:19.913 position:50% align:center
Well, there's our cue.

00:01:19.997 --> 00:01:23.000 position:50% align:center
I'm not trying to get eaten
by this damn planet.

--Huh?

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:26.712 position:50% align:center

[ROSE]
I've never seen it before!

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.982 position:50% align:center
It's even bigger than I'd heard!

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:49.902 position:50% align:center
Wait, how'd it sense us?
Could it be that--

00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:52.196 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Those nuts are
part of its giant body?

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:53.405 position:50% align:center
That's my guess.

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:55.866 position:50% align:center
They're probably
water-storing organs.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.284 position:50% align:center
[SAND KING roars]

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:00.412 position:50% align:center
[SIX] He doesn't seem
too happy about us taking them.

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:01.914 position:50% align:center
[SAND KING]
Huh?

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.045 position:50% align:center
You know what, Alice?!

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:09.671 position:50% align:center
I'm done with
this stupid planet.

00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:10.756 position:50% align:center
Let's go home.

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.342 position:50% align:center
Don't be such
a spoilsport, partner.

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:16.178 position:50% align:center
I, for one, find this planet's
unique fauna fascinating.

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:17.804 position:50% align:center
He's already gaining on us.

00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:19.556 position:50% align:center
At this rate,
he'll catch us in seconds!

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.558 position:50% align:center
Hey! Can't you
drive any faster?!

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:25.354 position:50% align:center
Afraid not, Six. All of you
need to pay close attention

00:02:25.437 --> 00:02:26.980 position:50% align:center
and jump as soon as I say to.

00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:27.981 position:50% align:center
You're kidding...

00:02:28.065 --> 00:02:29.900 position:50% align:center
What about the nuts?!

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:30.901 position:50% align:center
Jump.

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.402 position:50% align:center

00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:50.671 position:50% align:center
Well. There goes our water.

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:54.049 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Uh. We still have one nut.

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:56.760 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's a few thousand
shy of what we need.

00:02:56.844 --> 00:03:00.764 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Guess we failed
this mission, too.

00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:04.852 position:50% align:center
[SIX] But more importantly, does
anyone know how to get back?

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.995 position:50% align:center
[SIX] We've realized that
to get back to Grace,

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:50.415 position:50% align:center
we'll have to cross
the Tezan desert on foot,

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.210 position:50% align:center
while the sun burns into us
with all the tender mercy

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.879 position:50% align:center
of a drunk stepdad's cigarette.

00:04:58.632 --> 00:04:59.591 position:50% align:center
So hot...

00:04:59.675 --> 00:05:01.093 position:50% align:center
Shut up, will ya?

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:03.220 position:50% align:center
Hearing you complain about it
just makes me feel hotter.

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.556 position:50% align:center
Well, the sight of your clothes
make me feel hotter.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.891 position:50% align:center
Why're you still wearing
that goofy black armor?

00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:10.227 position:50% align:center
Because it comes with a
temperature adjusting function!

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.104 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait, are you serious?

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:14.857 position:50% align:center
That isn't fair--you should let
me wear the top half at least!

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.110 position:50% align:center
Couldn't if I tried--it was
made to fit my brawny bod.

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:21.405 position:50% align:center
Maybe the solution is for you to
let those bouncy babies breathe!

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:22.823 position:50% align:center
Cut it out, guys.

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:26.243 position:50% align:center
Waste your energy and
you'll end up even hungrier...

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.036 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
As usual, Count Thongula's had

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.122 position:50% align:center
her near fatal
dose of sunshine...

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:33.417 position:50% align:center
Listen, Six. I'm using our last
points to call in a tent.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.086 position:50% align:center
If you meatbags don't get out
of the sun soon, you're dead.

Fair 'nuff...

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.798 position:50% align:center
We have this for water,
at least...

[ROSE]
Commander...

00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:44.094 position:50% align:center
I really need to eat
something soon, okay...?

00:05:44.178 --> 00:05:46.388 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
We're all hungry... Can it...

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:48.056 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Unsavory as it may sound,

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.934 position:50% align:center
we'll just have to eat the first
demon beast we come across.

00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:52.436 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
We'll do what we've gotta.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.981 position:50% align:center
This is about survival.
The next thing we meet is meat!

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:57.107 position:50% align:center
Got it?

00:05:57.191 --> 00:05:58.609 position:50% align:center
[SNOW, ROSE]
Mm!

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:01.320 position:50% align:center
No, no, no! No way!
You can't make me!

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:02.946 position:50% align:center
I am not eating a friggin' orc!

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.324 position:50% align:center
You're the one who said
we'd eat the next thing we met!

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:06.867 position:50% align:center
Why are you trying
to be picky now?

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.702 position:50% align:center
Because he's a total wimp.

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:11.705 position:50% align:center
Hold his mouth open, Rose.
I'll jam it down his throat.

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:12.998 position:50% align:center
You've gotta stop them, Alice!

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.125 position:50% align:center
They wanna make me
abandon my humanity!

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:16.710 position:50% align:center
Not to worry.

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:19.379 position:50% align:center
I analyzed the orc's flesh and
it isn't toxic in the slightest.

00:06:19.463 --> 00:06:21.882 position:50% align:center
Poisonous or not, I ain't
gonna eat a sentient being!

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:24.384 position:50% align:center
[SNOW] Sure you will.
I'll feed it to you myself.

00:06:24.468 --> 00:06:26.136 position:50% align:center

No! Please!

00:06:28.597 --> 00:06:32.059 position:50% align:center

to dire tactics.

Hmm? What's that mean?

00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:45.697 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] You need to
yank down Snow's panties.

00:06:45.781 --> 00:06:47.991 position:50% align:center
Uh?! What are you
talking about, Alice?!

00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:51.119 position:50% align:center
You were my one hope!
Get ahold of yourself, will you?

00:06:51.203 --> 00:06:52.371 position:50% align:center
I'm real sorry, Snow,

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:54.373 position:50% align:center
but my partner's wish
is my command, so...

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:55.707 position:50% align:center
[SNOW]
Don't you dare!

00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:57.543 position:50% align:center
What? Did the sun
fry your brain?

00:06:57.626 --> 00:07:00.003 position:50% align:center
Come on, Alice. You're not
actually gonna let him do it.

00:07:00.087 --> 00:07:02.548 position:50% align:center
Oh, she's serious!
In case you've forgotten,

00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:05.175 position:50% align:center
I get rewarded for
acting like a degenerate.

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:06.426 position:50% align:center
[SNOW, ROSE gasp]

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.011 position:50% align:center
[SIX] I get evil points,
which can buy us food,

00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:09.763 position:50% align:center
or even another buggy.

00:07:09.847 --> 00:07:12.808 position:50% align:center
You know I'm surprised
I didn't think of this sooner.

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:15.394 position:50% align:center
Just stay still and
I'll earn us some dinner.

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:16.895 position:50% align:center
I'll cut your grubby hands off!

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:19.022 position:50% align:center
We're too close together
in here, so stop!

00:07:19.106 --> 00:07:21.692 position:50% align:center
We shouldn't do this till
we're really desperate, okay?

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:25.028 position:50% align:center
[SIX] I'm feelin' plenty
desperate, personally.

00:07:25.112 --> 00:07:26.613 position:50% align:center
And this is nothin' new for us.

00:07:26.697 --> 00:07:27.906 position:50% align:center
It's not like I've
never touched your tits

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.700 position:50% align:center
or tugged your panties
before, right?

take a turn for once.

Agh!

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.083 position:50% align:center
This is about survival, 'kay?

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.877 position:50% align:center
If you wanna be fair,
you could both--

Hmm. Hmm!

00:07:50.012 --> 00:07:52.347 position:50% align:center

You earned evil points!

Wow... Six...

00:07:54.016 --> 00:07:56.977 position:50% align:center
That's... just too far,
even going by my standards.

Yeah. Commander?
You're human scum.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:00.564 position:50% align:center
Huh? Huh?!

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.649 position:50% align:center
But... Alice told me to.

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:07.404 position:50% align:center
[SIX] We've been wandering
through the desert

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:12.451 position:50% align:center
for four days now and have
yet to see any sign of a town.

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:14.953 position:50% align:center
We finally realized that the
best way to avoid getting cooked

00:08:15.037 --> 00:08:17.915 position:50% align:center
was to start moving at night,
but this made us way less likely

00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:20.792 position:50% align:center
to find any demon
beasts, so yeah...

00:08:20.876 --> 00:08:22.503 position:50% align:center
We're out of food.

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:27.508 position:50% align:center
[SIX] And I've stopped getting
points for doing evil things

00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:29.593 position:50% align:center
to Grimm while she's passed out.

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:39.311 position:50% align:center
[SIX] I'd be glad to eat
an orc at this point.

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:42.898 position:50% align:center
[ROSE grunting]

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:46.026 position:50% align:center
[SIX] I was desperate enough to
try going into negative points,

but it didn't work.

00:08:47.528 --> 00:08:50.280 position:50% align:center
Which is weird,
since it did last time.

00:08:50.364 --> 00:08:53.575 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure
it's Astaroth's fault.

00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:57.079 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna earn a ton of points
off her when I get back.

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:59.164 position:50% align:center
At least that's
what I tell myself.

00:09:00.791 --> 00:09:02.960 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Rose has been acting kinda off.

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:05.295 position:50% align:center
I think she wants to
say something to me.

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:12.886 position:50% align:center
[SIX] She's keeping such
a close watch over Grimm.

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:17.224 position:50% align:center
[SIX] If there's one decent
person in this unit, it's her.

00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:20.102 position:50% align:center
She must be
worried about her friend.

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:23.647 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
So this is starvation, huh...?

00:09:26.817 --> 00:09:30.821 position:50% align:center
[SIX] I want a cheeseburger...
and an ice cold beer...

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:33.156 position:50% align:center
and five minutes of privacy...

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.536 position:50% align:center
Though... I'd prob'ly be
crankin' out dust at this point.

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:38.996 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Huh...?

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.000 position:50% align:center
[SIX gasps]

Mm.

[SNOW whimpers softly]

00:09:54.887 --> 00:09:57.639 position:50% align:center
What's goin' on here?

00:09:57.723 --> 00:10:00.309 position:50% align:center
Strange... I'm not
getting points.

00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:03.228 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Hey, Snow,
you're not into this, are you?

--[SNOW gasps]
--I mean, if you weren't,

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.274 position:50% align:center
then the company would
consider this evil, right?

00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:09.318 position:50% align:center
The only explanation
is that you like--

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.038 position:50% align:center
[SIX] After that, Snow and I
almost murdered each other.

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:23.290 position:50% align:center
Rose used to intervene
when we butted heads,

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:25.167 position:50% align:center
but she stopped recently.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.502 position:50% align:center
In fact...

00:10:26.585 --> 00:10:29.171 position:50% align:center
[SNOW, SIX grunting]

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:31.048 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
...she's been watching us,

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:33.842 position:50% align:center
like she's hoping for
something to happen.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.472 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Those eyes she makes...

00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:41.350 position:50% align:center
I've seen them somewhere before.

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:42.434 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
That's right!

00:10:42.518 --> 00:10:43.852 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Hmm?

00:10:43.936 --> 00:10:45.479 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Those are the same eyes
the sexually aggressive

when she looks at me!

[SPIDER WOMAN 9A chuckles]

00:10:49.358 --> 00:10:50.692 position:50% align:center
[SIX] It's said that when
people are placed

00:10:50.776 --> 00:10:52.986 position:50% align:center
in extreme situations,
their survival instincts kick in

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:56.448 position:50% align:center
and they attempt to breed.

00:10:56.532 --> 00:10:58.200 position:50% align:center
Sexual desire!

00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:05.624 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
I get it now.

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:08.752 position:50% align:center
Rose is makin' those eyes
because she's feelin' randy.

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:11.672 position:50% align:center
[ROSE moans]

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.384 position:50% align:center
I can relate!
I feel the same way!

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:17.219 position:50% align:center
We're all sharing the same tent.

00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:20.180 position:50% align:center
Without any privacy,
relief is hard to come by.

00:11:20.264 --> 00:11:22.224 position:50% align:center
Mm-mm-mm-mm...

00:11:23.684 --> 00:11:26.436 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Hold on.
Where am I goin' with this?

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.896 position:50% align:center
I mean Grimm and Snow
are one thing,

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.358 position:50% align:center
but Rose looks
pretty frickin' young.

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:33.735 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no. That would
violate the agent's code,

00:11:33.819 --> 00:11:37.030 position:50% align:center
and our sexual
harassment policy!

00:11:37.114 --> 00:11:38.740 position:50% align:center
Which means...

00:11:40.242 --> 00:11:43.370 position:50% align:center
...if I want points,
I have to get 'em from her.

00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
And flippin' her
skirt up won't cut it.

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:06.226 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Tch. This is an emergency now.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.062 position:50% align:center
I'm strippin' ya down.
Get ready.

00:12:10.439 --> 00:12:12.191 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and try it.

00:12:12.274 --> 00:12:15.110 position:50% align:center
My patience has reached
its absolute limit.

00:12:15.194 --> 00:12:17.529 position:50% align:center
Let's end this now.

00:12:17.613 --> 00:12:19.489 position:50% align:center
Be reasonable, Snow.

00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center
Just stay still for
one minute, and soon,

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:24.703 position:50% align:center
we'll have full bellies
and smiles on our faces.

00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:26.997 position:50% align:center
I might come out of it with
a few more reasons to smile

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.210 position:50% align:center
than you, but open your mind
and you'll see that it's still

00:12:31.293 --> 00:12:34.213 position:50% align:center
a good deal for us both.

00:12:34.296 --> 00:12:36.632 position:50% align:center
This is a desperate situation.

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:38.300 position:50% align:center
You would say
anything to trick me,

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:41.678 position:50% align:center
I know that. But...

00:12:41.762 --> 00:12:44.389 position:50% align:center
[SIX] You don't wanna die
out here, do ya?

00:12:44.473 --> 00:12:48.143 position:50% align:center
You want a full belly and
a ride home, don't you?

00:12:48.227 --> 00:12:49.561 position:50% align:center
I know I do, Boss!

00:12:49.645 --> 00:12:52.231 position:50% align:center
That's great, but I'm not
talking to you right now.

00:12:52.314 --> 00:12:54.358 position:50% align:center
So how about it, Snow?

00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:56.360 position:50% align:center
Take me up on my offer now,

00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:59.446 position:50% align:center
and I'll even throw in a rare
item to sweeten the pot.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.572 position:50% align:center
[SNOW grunts]

00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:04.910 position:50% align:center
You can either
keep it or sell it for cash.

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:06.495 position:50% align:center
You are still tryin'
to pay off the loan

00:13:06.578 --> 00:13:08.205 position:50% align:center
on your sword, aren't'cha?

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:10.958 position:50% align:center
You... silver-tongued
skeezeball.

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:13.293 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I fail
to see the issue here.

00:13:13.377 --> 00:13:14.795 position:50% align:center
You were all over
that Engel guy.

00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:16.630 position:50% align:center
What makes this
situation so different?

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:18.423 position:50% align:center
Look! I was temporarily blinded

00:13:18.507 --> 00:13:20.926 position:50% align:center
by his all-but literally
boundless wealth!

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:23.846 position:50% align:center
And I could get him
to take responsibility.

00:13:23.929 --> 00:13:27.891 position:50% align:center
Unlike... the piece of trash
that you call your partner.

00:13:27.975 --> 00:13:29.226 position:50% align:center
That's fair.

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:31.353 position:50% align:center
"Take responsibility" is not
my favorite phrase.

00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:33.188 position:50% align:center
I was trying to persuade her
to go along with it,

00:13:33.272 --> 00:13:34.731 position:50% align:center
you clueless shithead.

00:13:34.815 --> 00:13:37.734 position:50% align:center
That settles it.
I am not letting you touch me.

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:46.577 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Uh. Hey. I wasn't
done talkin' to you.

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:55.002 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Having to carry Grimm
has been bad enough.

00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:57.629 position:50% align:center
If Snow goes down
on us too, then...

00:13:57.713 --> 00:13:59.214 position:50% align:center
[SNOW groans]

00:13:59.298 --> 00:14:01.925 position:50% align:center
This is your chance.
Get to it while you can.

She can net you a few points
before she loses consciousness.

00:14:05.012 --> 00:14:07.264 position:50% align:center
Nah, not even I
can stoop that low.

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:09.808 position:50% align:center
You're just a coward.
And in case you were wondering,

00:14:09.892 --> 00:14:12.144 position:50% align:center
this is definitely why you've
never gotten promoted.

00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:14.354 position:50% align:center
Look. I'm no chivalrous prince,
but taking advantage of

00:14:14.438 --> 00:14:16.356 position:50% align:center
a girl who's too weak
to move isn't a line

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.858 position:50% align:center
that anyone should cross!

--Um. Commander, sir?
--Huh?!

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:24.281 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but... I can't
control myself anymore.

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:25.532 position:50% align:center
You can't what?

00:14:25.616 --> 00:14:29.661 position:50% align:center
I was watching you, and...
Is this okay, sir?

00:14:29.745 --> 00:14:32.414 position:50% align:center
No. It's not. I'm pretty dang
sure you're way too young.

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:34.750 position:50% align:center
Snow is this team's
designated fanservice girl.

00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:36.543 position:50% align:center
I can mess with her guilt free.

00:14:36.627 --> 00:14:39.379 position:50% align:center
But sir... I don't
think I can hold back.

Ahh...

00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:42.174 position:50% align:center
Oh, okay.

00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:45.302 position:50% align:center
If you insist, then there's
nothing to be done.

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:48.180 position:50% align:center
Sorry for making you
embarrass yourself.

00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:50.724 position:50% align:center
I guess you could say
you caught me by surprise.

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:53.685 position:50% align:center
It's fine...
I understand...

00:14:53.769 --> 00:14:55.103 position:50% align:center
This is just another
one of those lines

00:14:55.187 --> 00:14:57.689 position:50% align:center
that probably shouldn't
be crossed, isn't it?

00:14:57.773 --> 00:14:59.191 position:50% align:center
It sure is.

00:14:59.274 --> 00:15:01.568 position:50% align:center
For one thing, you and I are
both part of the same unit.

00:15:01.652 --> 00:15:03.195 position:50% align:center
If we actually do what
you're suggesting,

00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:06.365 position:50% align:center
there's a good chance it'll
interfere with future missions.

00:15:06.448 --> 00:15:09.326 position:50% align:center
But, this is an emergency.

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:10.786 position:50% align:center
There ya go...

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:14.331 position:50% align:center
And no one's watching,
so no one can judge us.

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:16.875 position:50% align:center
Now, then.
Just follow your instincts.

00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:19.586 position:50% align:center
This is all natural
and normal, I promise.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.171 position:50% align:center
It's normal...

00:15:21.255 --> 00:15:24.967 position:50% align:center
This is an emergency,
so I should trust my instincts.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:26.385 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:29.096 position:50% align:center
We're only humans, and humans
have needs, ya feel me?

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:31.390 position:50% align:center
For sure! We've gotta do
what we've gotta do,

00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:33.350 position:50% align:center
it's really that
simple, isn't it?

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:35.894 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I'm a little
surprised though.

00:15:35.978 --> 00:15:39.106 position:50% align:center
I wasn't expecting you to be
such a man-eater, y'know?

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:43.360 position:50% align:center
Then... are carnivore girls
not to your liking?

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:45.696 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! I think they're amazing!

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:47.030 position:50% align:center
And it's cool to be desired,

00:15:47.114 --> 00:15:49.616 position:50% align:center
even if this means
I get fewer evil points.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.868 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Pretty sure
I'll get some from this,

00:15:50.951 --> 00:15:52.786 position:50% align:center
no matter what, though.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.038 position:50% align:center
We're just following
the laws of nature, right?

00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:56.623 position:50% align:center
Thanks for explaining
all of this to me.

00:15:56.707 --> 00:15:59.585 position:50% align:center
I feel a lot less guilty now!

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:00.878 position:50% align:center

Make sure to resist with all
the strength you have, okay?

Uh. What's that?

00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:07.926 position:50% align:center
You wanna take
advantage of me now?

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.220 position:50% align:center
Well, come to think of it,
I'm lovin' that idea.

00:16:10.304 --> 00:16:12.764 position:50% align:center
Gives me a solid excuse
if we ever get caught.

00:16:12.848 --> 00:16:14.224 position:50% align:center
I kept this to myself before,

00:16:14.308 --> 00:16:16.310 position:50% align:center
but I've always
wanted to eat you up!

00:16:16.393 --> 00:16:17.769 position:50% align:center
No holding back, okay?

00:16:17.853 --> 00:16:19.605 position:50% align:center
Huh? I was plannin'
to be gentle,

00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:21.732 position:50% align:center
but if you would rather
I just went all out...

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:24.359 position:50% align:center
Well, who the hell
am I to argue?

00:16:24.443 --> 00:16:27.112 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, sir, but I just
can't wait any longer!

00:16:27.196 --> 00:16:28.572 position:50% align:center
Gimme just a second.

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:31.158 position:50% align:center
Let me at least wipe myself
down with a towel for ya.

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:32.868 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
I mean it's just good manners.

00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
I think you're fine as you are.

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:36.538 position:50% align:center
You smell like
an absolute snack--

00:16:36.622 --> 00:16:38.665 position:50% align:center
I mean, I'm starting
to salivate already!

00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:40.250 position:50% align:center
Well, thanks for sharing, Rose.

00:16:40.334 --> 00:16:43.378 position:50% align:center
I had no idea you could be so
forward about this kinda thing.

00:16:43.462 --> 00:16:45.297 position:50% align:center
You sure know
what you want, don't you?

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.674 position:50% align:center
Yes! I'll make this
as painless as I can!

00:16:47.758 --> 00:16:49.176 position:50% align:center
Oh? Yeah?

00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:52.596 position:50% align:center
[SIX] I'm in too deep!
There's no backing out now!

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:56.058 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:59.811 position:50% align:center
[SIX whimpers]

00:17:00.938 --> 00:17:03.106 position:50% align:center
Hey. Let me ask
you two something.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.025 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
No! Go back outside!

00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:07.110 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] What do you think
you're about to do?

00:17:07.194 --> 00:17:08.987 position:50% align:center
Just a bit of
the ol' slap n' tickle.

00:17:09.071 --> 00:17:11.823 position:50% align:center
That's right!
I'm gonna eat the commander!

00:17:11.907 --> 00:17:13.825 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] It sounds to me
like you're talking about

00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:15.577 position:50% align:center
very different things.

00:17:15.661 --> 00:17:18.038 position:50% align:center
I'm about to do something
naughty with Rose here, right?

00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:19.873 position:50% align:center
I'm about to be locked
in mortal combat with

00:17:19.957 --> 00:17:21.208 position:50% align:center
the commander, right?

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:22.835 position:50% align:center
Uh. I'm not one to kink-shame,

00:17:22.918 --> 00:17:25.629 position:50% align:center
but "mortal combat" seems
a little extreme to me.

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:27.256 position:50% align:center
But it's gotta be mortal,
because the loser

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:30.759 position:50% align:center
has to get eaten in accordance
with the laws of nature.

00:17:30.843 --> 00:17:33.762 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Mm-- Do you mean
eaten in, like, a sexy way?

00:17:33.846 --> 00:17:36.473 position:50% align:center
I mean eaten in,
like, a food way.

00:17:36.557 --> 00:17:38.767 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Wah! That isn't funny,
stay away from me,

00:17:38.851 --> 00:17:39.977 position:50% align:center
ya little monster!

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.019 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
What's wrong with you?!

00:17:41.103 --> 00:17:42.604 position:50% align:center
You were all about it before!

00:17:42.688 --> 00:17:45.607 position:50% align:center
You said it was a human need and
that acting on it was natural!

00:17:45.691 --> 00:17:48.026 position:50% align:center
I did more or less
say that, didn't I?! Wah!

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.152 position:50% align:center
This is an "emergency,"

00:17:49.236 --> 00:17:50.654 position:50% align:center
so there's no time
to waste, Commander!

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:52.030 position:50% align:center
--[SIX yelps]
--[ROSE] Hyah!

00:17:52.114 --> 00:17:54.241 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Calm down! This is all
a big misunderstanding!

00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:56.243 position:50% align:center
When you told me that
you liked carnivore girls,

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:59.079 position:50% align:center
it made me happier than
you could possibly imagine.

00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:00.539 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
Words are tricky things, huh?

00:18:00.622 --> 00:18:02.666 position:50% align:center
I guess this is what you
would call a "culture clash."

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:03.876 position:50% align:center
Anyway, bye!

00:18:03.959 --> 00:18:05.210 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:18:05.294 --> 00:18:08.380 position:50% align:center
That smell of yours
really has me drooling.

00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:11.884 position:50% align:center
Hearing that still makes
my heart pound,

00:18:11.967 --> 00:18:13.135 position:50% align:center
but a whole lot
harder than before

00:18:13.218 --> 00:18:14.970 position:50% align:center
and for very different reasons!

00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:16.555 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
Know what my Grandpa told me?!

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:18.807 position:50% align:center
He said, when you fall in love,
you get the irresistible urge

00:18:18.891 --> 00:18:20.851 position:50% align:center
to become one with your partner!

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:22.019 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
That may be true,

00:18:22.102 --> 00:18:23.729 position:50% align:center
but not in the way
you're thinking it is!

00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:27.316 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I'm leaving.
Have fun, you crazy kids.

00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:29.860 position:50% align:center
Know what, have it your way.
Try and eat me.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.904 position:50% align:center
I'll just beat
the snot outta ya.

00:18:31.987 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center
Great! I know you
have your doubts,

00:18:33.864 --> 00:18:35.741 position:50% align:center
but I think we've been
fated to fight this battle

00:18:35.824 --> 00:18:37.534 position:50% align:center
since before we were born.

00:18:37.618 --> 00:18:40.120 position:50% align:center
You're facing a warrior
of the Kingdom of Grace.

00:18:40.204 --> 00:18:42.915 position:50% align:center
I'm combat Chimera Rose!
Hope you're ready.

00:18:42.998 --> 00:18:45.042 position:50% align:center
You face a warrior of Kisaragi.

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:46.752 position:50% align:center
My name's Combat Agent Six.

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:49.671 position:50% align:center
And I'm gonna squeeze you for
every evil point I can get.

00:18:49.755 --> 00:18:54.635 position:50% align:center
--[SIX, ROSE yelling, grunting]
--[coins dinging]

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:56.345 position:50% align:center
Nice. It sounds like
we'll have all the points

00:18:56.428 --> 00:18:58.430 position:50% align:center
--we need soon enough.
--[coins dinging]

00:18:58.514 --> 00:19:01.600 position:50% align:center
[VOICE 1A]
You earned so many evil points!

00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:10.734 position:50% align:center
This sucks, let's go back
to Earth already.

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
Here I thought you
enjoyed yourself last night.

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:16.281 position:50% align:center
No way! I wasn't about to
risk my life for a cheap thrill.

00:19:16.365 --> 00:19:19.368 position:50% align:center
Luckily, clocking the kid was
enough to earn us this ride.

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:22.538 position:50% align:center
[ROSE sighs] I'm never gonna
take meat for granted again...

00:19:22.621 --> 00:19:25.123 position:50% align:center
Combat chimeras
are honestly scary.

00:19:25.207 --> 00:19:28.126 position:50% align:center
I fought with everything I had,
and she still gave me trouble.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.712 position:50% align:center
Huh. That's rather interesting.

00:19:30.796 --> 00:19:33.507 position:50% align:center
I'll consider it one more reason
for us to start investigating

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.676 position:50% align:center
this planet's ruins.

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:37.511 position:50% align:center
--There it is.
--[SIX] Hmm?

00:19:39.555 --> 00:19:42.099 position:50% align:center
Too bad.
We failed another mission.

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:45.853 position:50% align:center
So we did. I forgot
that we were on a mission.

00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:55.821 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS] Toris and the demons
are working together.

00:19:55.904 --> 00:19:58.282 position:50% align:center
They'll launch
an attack on Grace soon.

00:19:58.365 --> 00:19:59.658 position:50% align:center
[SIX]
I see.

00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:02.160 position:50% align:center
You're hopin' I can bail
you outta this, is that it?

00:20:02.244 --> 00:20:04.496 position:50% align:center
So ya know:
my services ain't cheap.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.956 position:50% align:center
In case you've forgotten,

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:08.834 position:50% align:center
you are the main reason that
we're in this predicament.

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:11.211 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, it's been
so long that I'd forgotten.

00:20:11.295 --> 00:20:12.629 position:50% align:center
It's been one week, Six.

00:20:12.713 --> 00:20:15.007 position:50% align:center
You have the retention
of a goldfish.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.885 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS growls]
Whether you like it or not,

00:20:17.968 --> 00:20:20.053 position:50% align:center
you're taking responsibility
for your failure

00:20:20.137 --> 00:20:21.597 position:50% align:center
to get the water nuts.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.765 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Yeah, still not a fan
of that "responsibility" talk.

00:20:23.849 --> 00:20:24.766 position:50% align:center
[TILLIS growls]

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:25.893 position:50% align:center
You really are a shithead,

00:20:25.976 --> 00:20:27.853 position:50% align:center
right down to your
shitty, shitty core.

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:29.813 position:50% align:center
Till we secure
a new water supply,

00:20:29.897 --> 00:20:32.149 position:50% align:center
we've little to
sustain our troops.

00:20:32.232 --> 00:20:35.068 position:50% align:center
Your next mission
will help us end this war.

00:20:35.152 --> 00:20:37.487 position:50% align:center
Had you accomplished
your previous mission,

00:20:37.571 --> 00:20:41.825 position:50% align:center
I'd have given you this map of
the ruins in Toris as a reward.

00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:44.745 position:50% align:center
According to my sources, those
ruins are being investigated

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:47.164 position:50% align:center
by a pair of demon
leaders right now.

00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:49.374 position:50% align:center
Probably Heine and Russel.

00:20:51.502 --> 00:20:52.961 position:50% align:center
From what Heine told us,

00:20:53.045 --> 00:20:55.964 position:50% align:center
they're looking for an ancient
weapon to defeat the Sand King.

00:20:56.048 --> 00:20:57.674 position:50% align:center
Which brings us to your mission.

00:20:57.758 --> 00:20:59.718 position:50% align:center
I'd like you to get in
their way however you can

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.887 position:50% align:center
and stop them from grabbing it.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.097 position:50% align:center
[SIX] Hmph! So I just need
to smash it, right?

00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:06.058 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
No! Think!

00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:09.228 position:50% align:center
If we're going
after this weapon...

00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:11.104 position:50% align:center
...let's take it for ourselves.

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:45.449 position:50% align:center
[GROUP groaning]

00:22:45.532 --> 00:22:47.451 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
Please... Someone...

00:22:47.534 --> 00:22:49.453 position:50% align:center
Get me some hot tea...

00:22:49.536 --> 00:22:54.208 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL] And food...
Mama needs a snack, ASAP.

00:22:54.291 --> 00:22:56.835 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
Well, grab it yourselves...

00:22:56.919 --> 00:22:59.087 position:50% align:center
We finally managed
to defeat those heroes,

00:22:59.171 --> 00:23:03.342 position:50% align:center
but it was totally exhausting...

00:23:03.425 --> 00:23:05.260 position:50% align:center
[GROUP sighs]

00:23:05.344 --> 00:23:09.014 position:50% align:center
[LILITH] Six would get me
tea if he was here...

00:23:09.097 --> 00:23:11.683 position:50% align:center
[LILITH sighs]
Even after spending a month

00:23:11.767 --> 00:23:14.061 position:50% align:center
fighting for his
life in the Sahara,

00:23:14.144 --> 00:23:17.856 position:50% align:center
he would still go and fetch me
whatever I asked for...

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.401 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH] So... you were
using him as an errand boy?

00:23:21.485 --> 00:23:24.655 position:50% align:center
Did you seriously think that one
of us would do that for you...?

00:23:24.738 --> 00:23:28.617 position:50% align:center
I guess Six isn't quite
the bastard I thought he was...

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.410 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
What does his report say?

00:23:30.494 --> 00:23:32.538 position:50% align:center
Is he doing all right?

00:23:32.621 --> 00:23:35.249 position:50% align:center
[BELIAL] I don't know.
I haven't read it yet.

00:23:35.332 --> 00:23:37.209 position:50% align:center
Too tired...

00:23:37.292 --> 00:23:38.877 position:50% align:center
[ASTAROTH]
That's no good...

00:23:38.961 --> 00:23:40.045 position:50% align:center
Ow...

00:23:40.128 --> 00:23:41.797 position:50% align:center
Let's just get some rest...

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.131 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
Agreed...

00:23:43.215 --> 00:23:46.385 position:50% align:center
But don't forget,
when we wake up,

00:23:46.468 --> 00:23:49.721 position:50% align:center
we're gonna party like
there's no tomorrow...
