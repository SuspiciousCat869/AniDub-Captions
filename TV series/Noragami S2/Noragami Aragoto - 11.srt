1
00:00:02,262 --> 00:00:04,865
Kazuma. Is there anything to report?

2
00:00:05,096 --> 00:00:06,873
No activity from the heavens.

3
00:00:07,304 --> 00:00:09,454
We should be the first to arrive on the scene.

4
00:00:10,987 --> 00:00:15,446
Aiha, listen. I know we haven't fought together
much lately, but I'll need your strength today.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,544
I hope I'm not asking too much.

6
00:00:18,014 --> 00:00:20,053
No! You can count on me.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,085
Milady.

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,100
Pardon me, but if Lord Ebisu really is the
conjurer, as the heavens allege him to be...

9
00:00:26,453 --> 00:00:29,485
It's possible his Masked Ones attacked our clan.

10
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:33,043
No, I don't think so. It isn't
the sort of thing he would do.

11
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:39,058
He is unconventional, I'll grant you that. But he
would never disrupt the heavens without good cause.

12
00:00:40,186 --> 00:00:44,970
I have faith in him as a fellow God of
Fortune. I won't let him die needlessly.

13
00:00:45,804 --> 00:00:46,996
Let's keep moving.

14
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:48,558
Yes, my lady!

15
00:00:53,924 --> 00:00:54,878
A Vent?

16
00:02:34,358 --> 00:02:36,786
A Vent? Now what's going on?

17
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:42,641
It's been a while, but if I remember
right... Don't Vents open into the underworld?

18
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:47,875
Let's go get a closer look. This
could be our chance to find a way in.

19
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:55,088
Yato. Please be all right.

20
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,566
Okay, listen, when we get there...

21
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:05,521
Where is she?

22
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:13,219
I... I can't move. I'm being restrained.

23
00:03:13,344 --> 00:03:20,775
Oh, my. What a surprise, meeting you
here. But maybe we've come on similar errands.

24
00:03:21,025 --> 00:03:23,803
Do you have business to settle with Yato as well?

25
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,472
Kugaha! What's he doing here?

26
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:30,507
You see, I owe him for this.

27
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:37,086
Do you know how annoying it is to live with only
one hand? The simplest tasks become so difficult.

28
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:41,130
I mean to change that, and your hand will do nicely.

29
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:43,941
Yato!

30
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:44,939
Hiyori!

31
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:48,306
You stay the hell away from her!

32
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,052
Kugaha! Restraint!

33
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,667
Hm...

34
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:00,708
It didn't work.

35
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:02,225
Of course it didn't work.

36
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:04,274
I am not Kuga anymore.

37
00:04:04,626 --> 00:04:07,071
An invocation requires your target's name.

38
00:04:07,738 --> 00:04:12,575
So it's fairly easy to determine
who has the upper hand here, Yukine.

39
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:14,793
What do we do now?

40
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:16,381
You just stay back!

41
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:20,900
Wait, what?

42
00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:25,976
Hear the shock in her voice? She's
surprised a Blessed Vessel could be so weak.

43
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:32,039
Say what you want. You're just a
backstabbing Nora. Whose dog are you this time?

44
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:39,515
Listen to the feisty little boy! You put on a good show,
but I bet you're panicking because you don't know my name.

45
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:42,690
I've heard it all before.

46
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:49,067
Gods and other Regalia are constantly insulting us Noras.
But do you even know the real reason why they do it?

47
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:52,751
Because we Noras are so powerful.

48
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:59,333
To use an invocation against someone, you must
first know their name. But Noras have multiple names.

49
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:06,281
You are now experiencing how unsettling, even
terrifying, that fact can be to those who aren't like us.

50
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:12,799
That's why everyone despises us. Because
they hate uncertainty and fear the unknown.

51
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:17,293
Because they cannot name you, they despise you?

52
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:20,750
Don't listen to him. He's messing with your head!

53
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,044
Understand now, Blessed Vessel?

54
00:05:24,142 --> 00:05:29,343
Others like you may enjoy fame and the worship
of many believers, but they amount to nothing.

55
00:05:29,557 --> 00:05:36,399
Not even Kazuma can equal my power. Truth
is, the strong are strong, blessed or not.

56
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:39,078
Look at little Hiiro. She's a perfect example.

57
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,474
Who is Hiiro?

58
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:45,939
You know, the one Yato always goes back
to. Little lady Hiiro, dressed in white.

59
00:05:47,121 --> 00:05:47,854
Nora?

60
00:05:48,235 --> 00:05:50,150
You mean you didn't even know her name?

61
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:53,527
Did your master keep it a secret from you? How sad.

62
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:58,199
And if he took her with him into the underworld,
he must trust her a lot more than you, huh?

63
00:05:59,135 --> 00:05:59,929
Shut up!

64
00:05:59,954 --> 00:06:00,811
Yukine!

65
00:06:00,836 --> 00:06:02,996
Really? Let's see what you've got!

66
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:06,818
Nope! Not good enough!

67
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:11,834
No way! He's overpowering me! But I'm a Blessed Vessel!

68
00:06:15,212 --> 00:06:17,513
Pathetic. Just pathetic.

69
00:06:20,002 --> 00:06:21,738
Hurry! Let's get out of here!

70
00:06:28,316 --> 00:06:30,097
You can't beat a Nora!

71
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:36,983
Don't let him get to you, okay? You
have to remember! You're a Blessed Vessel.

72
00:06:37,008 --> 00:06:38,311
Yeah, I know that!

73
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:40,620
You're the one Yato made his exemplar.

74
00:06:40,645 --> 00:06:44,024
I know! I know! But still...

75
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:46,957
He took her! Why not take me, damn it?

76
00:06:47,753 --> 00:06:49,293
Don't think like that.

77
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:52,978
Come on, let's play some more! I'm still having fun!

78
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:58,524
You know how hard I've worked trying
to get stronger. It's all been for him.

79
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:02,489
I wanted to make sure Nora
never became his exemplar instead.

80
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:03,901
Now this!

81
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:07,675
There's no use running away, kids!

82
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:16,519
He chose Nora.

83
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:21,533
Look, you should know, Yato told me something once.

84
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:25,180
And I knew he meant it. Listen.

85
00:07:25,716 --> 00:07:28,871
He told me he'd always wanted to find someone like you.

86
00:07:29,786 --> 00:07:31,281
Thank you, Yukine.

87
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:38,041
As long as I've lived, you're the first Regalia to
change for me. I'm so gonna brag to everybody about this.

88
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:41,181
Don't you get it? You're Yato's one special person.

89
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,750
His... one special person?

90
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:45,810
It's the truth! Yukine...

91
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:49,316
I found you!

92
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:53,187
You have to listen to me! Have faith in Yato!

93
00:07:56,063 --> 00:07:57,055
Borderline!

94
00:07:57,087 --> 00:07:58,104
Borderline!

95
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:17,455
Wow! Amazing! You did it. You beat him!

96
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:21,649
Let's go, Hiyori. Let's find Yato.

97
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:34,608
Damn it.

98
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:37,404
Hold on! Stay strong, Yato.

99
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:48,009
I did it. I actually did it! I managed to save Ebisu!

100
00:08:48,352 --> 00:08:51,869
And I didn't do it for my old
man. I did it because I wanted to.

101
00:08:53,174 --> 00:08:58,288
Don't you dare die, Ebisu! If you give
up now, I'll kick the crap outta you.

102
00:08:58,691 --> 00:09:00,521
Hear me? That's a promise!

103
00:09:09,104 --> 00:09:10,142
Is this right?

104
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:13,928
Do all of these names belong to me? So many.

105
00:09:14,302 --> 00:09:17,120
If you include the local and historical variants.

106
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:19,861
I'm almost like a Nora then.

107
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:25,819
And it looks like the name Ebisu has many
different meanings. Including "drowned corpse."

108
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,624
With all these possibilities, who am I, really?

109
00:09:30,587 --> 00:09:37,363
One story claims that you are Master Hiruko,
the first child of Lord Izanagi and Lady Izanami.

110
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,322
Hiruko.

111
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:39,597
Yes, that's right.

112
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:45,300
Though, I now call you Lord Ebisu because it is
the name you are most widely known by these days.

113
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,795
I see.

114
00:09:47,826 --> 00:09:49,965
I wonder why my parents didn't want me.

115
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:52,849
Ebisu. Ebisu!

116
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:55,129
Come to your senses!

117
00:09:57,124 --> 00:09:57,995
He's awake!

118
00:09:58,066 --> 00:09:59,114
Are you all right?

119
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,219
Bishamon.

120
00:10:02,358 --> 00:10:07,075
Thank goodness. With the way you were
lying there, I thought you had been executed!

121
00:10:07,655 --> 00:10:09,164
Can you stand, Lord Ebisu?

122
00:10:09,749 --> 00:10:12,194
Lady Bishamon! Kazuma!

123
00:10:13,108 --> 00:10:16,968
You two! Why are you here? I told you to stay away!

124
00:10:17,969 --> 00:10:19,429
Who is that man?

125
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:20,763
Lord Ebisu.

126
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:26,069
Be careful! You're still weak.

127
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:31,432
The Yato god. He didn't make it out.

128
00:10:32,502 --> 00:10:34,507
He's still in the underworld.

129
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,674
The Yato god is still in the underworld.

130
00:10:42,217 --> 00:10:43,406
You must hurry.

131
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:46,925
I don't understand. What would he be doing there?

132
00:10:47,624 --> 00:10:56,101
He came to the underworld for me. To bring me back.
I-If we don't help him, he'll be Izanami's forever.

133
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:59,665
Hold on! Why would Yato go save you?

134
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:01,792
None of this makes any sense.

135
00:11:02,553 --> 00:11:05,469
Bishamon, please help him. For...

136
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:08,478
Did he die?

137
00:11:08,845 --> 00:11:10,486
He's passed out, that's all.

138
00:11:13,787 --> 00:11:14,733
Over there!

139
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:38,684
I've got you! I've got you! Now, come to me,
my dear. My beautiful, wonderful, darling, Yato!

140
00:11:44,474 --> 00:11:48,471
No!

141
00:11:49,194 --> 00:11:51,562
Where are you?

142
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:06,478
Will you be all right? Here, hold on.

143
00:12:09,657 --> 00:12:12,858
Let me wrap this up for you. There, all better.

144
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:15,861
You'll be fine now. Right?

145
00:12:18,108 --> 00:12:19,206
Yeah, sure.

146
00:12:25,326 --> 00:12:27,405
I don't know how you're so calm.

147
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:31,671
We're gonna die down here if we don't
find a Vent. You realize that, don't you?

148
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:36,494
Yes. But as long as I'm with you, I don't mind.

149
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:49,471
Hiiro's always been different from other people. It's
like she's totally fearless. Nothing seems to faze her.

150
00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:54,857
And as a Regalia, she's never once tainted me.

151
00:12:56,483 --> 00:12:57,352
Maybe...

152
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:01,086
Maybe I could stay with her.

153
00:13:05,775 --> 00:13:06,552
Hiki.

154
00:13:13,196 --> 00:13:14,689
What are you planning to do?

155
00:13:15,768 --> 00:13:18,017
I'm gonna find a Vent, if it kills me.

156
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,679
I will get back to them, whatever it takes!

157
00:13:22,688 --> 00:13:25,207
Even though you might already be long forgotten?

158
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,790
I have to get out of here.

159
00:13:29,237 --> 00:13:31,373
And cut ties with the old man.

160
00:13:31,731 --> 00:13:33,302
I have to get back to them!

161
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:34,216
Yato!

162
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:36,807
Found you!

163
00:13:40,064 --> 00:13:42,012
You're mine now!

164
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,027
Yato!

165
00:13:44,215 --> 00:13:47,349
Come to me, my darling. Come.

166
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:51,155
Please, Lady Bishamon!

167
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:53,371
How can we get into the underworld?

168
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:56,287
The entrance is sealed. Now so's the Vent.

169
00:13:56,342 --> 00:13:58,544
It doesn't matter. You can't go.

170
00:14:01,045 --> 00:14:02,881
It's Kofuku and Daikoku.

171
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,098
I'm glad you're here.

172
00:14:05,518 --> 00:14:09,078
That's right! Help us! You can open up a Vent.

173
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:12,343
You absolutely cannot go into the underworld.

174
00:14:12,469 --> 00:14:15,211
It's no place for humans. You'll never leave alive.

175
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,488
Lady Bishamon, I beg you.

176
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,735
Please take me into the underworld!

177
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:24,571
Do what?

178
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:29,949
You must let me do this. I have to save him.

179
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:32,539
I'm prepared to risk my name for my master.

180
00:14:41,816 --> 00:14:42,582
Yukki.

181
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:43,448
Hm?

182
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:49,923
If you're that determined, there's only one option.
You must enter the underworld as someone else's Regalia.

183
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:53,014
Are you willing to become a Nora?

184
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,399
He can't do that!

185
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,644
There is no need for you to sully
your name, Blessed Vessel of Yato.

186
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:04,807
You can leave this to me. I'll bring back your master.

187
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,989
Are you sure?

188
00:15:06,961 --> 00:15:07,696
Kura.

189
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:11,469
Stay and look after Ebisu.

190
00:15:11,804 --> 00:15:13,082
Yes, my lady.

191
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:18,049
It makes no difference where he
hides. The heavens will find him.

192
00:15:18,566 --> 00:15:21,560
Hopefully, he will recover enough
to explain what he's been up to.

193
00:15:22,477 --> 00:15:24,580
We must clear him of these charges.

194
00:15:25,103 --> 00:15:26,893
Now, let's hurry. Choki!

195
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:27,496
Right!

196
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:36,791
Bisha, please save him.

197
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:38,618
Please get our Yatty back.

198
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:40,295
I will.

199
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,034
Kokki.

200
00:15:44,368 --> 00:15:45,945
Don't do anything reckless.

201
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:48,296
We want all of you back here in one piece!

202
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:56,893
O band of fiends treading upon sacred
land! With the Kokki, I pierce you. Bore!

203
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:01,849
Let's go!

204
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:02,944
Right!

205
00:16:06,727 --> 00:16:09,468
Lady Kofuku, stand back where it's safer.

206
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,916
Those fools! I'm surprised they even survived down here.

207
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:22,525
Something just flew up my skirt. Ew!

208
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,540
Stop it! We need to stay calm.

209
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,972
Why do you suppose Yato entered the underworld?

210
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:33,286
Ebisu claims Yato went there to save him. I
don't know what his true goal might have been.

211
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,785
But there's one thing I'm certain of.

212
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:43,046
The Yato god has people waiting for
him. So we must make sure he returns.

213
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:58,306
Scouting the area. Follow this
waterway. There's a cave at the end of it.

214
00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:00,777
And Yato? Can you determine his location?

215
00:17:01,816 --> 00:17:03,439
Look at the ground, my lady.

216
00:17:04,972 --> 00:17:05,258
Hm?

217
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,588
Do you see a thread-like substance?
It stretches down toward the cave.

218
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,405
It's not thread, it's hair!

219
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:17,913
I think we can assume it belongs to her.

220
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:26,957
Whoa. What happened? I did try to hold back a little,
but even so, no Vent of mine should close up so quickly.

221
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:31,759
That last Vent seemed to close out
of nowhere, too. What's going on here?

222
00:17:32,234 --> 00:17:34,181
Is she sealing up the underworld?

223
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:45,185
Are you ready to give up and stay
here with me? My sweet. My Yato.

224
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,065
Huh?

225
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,848
You're Izanami, the queen of the underworld?

226
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:03,206
Who are you?

227
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:10,173
One of the Seven Gods of Fortune.
Bishamonten. I seek the Yato god.

228
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:11,580
Will you turn him over?

229
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,421
If not, we fight. No holding back!

230
00:18:14,483 --> 00:18:18,358
Yeah, you know who you're up against?
A war god with a Blessed Vessel!

231
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:21,077
Bishamon? You came?

232
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:22,656
She's caught him.

233
00:18:25,402 --> 00:18:27,791
There's no way he'll be able to escape on his own.

234
00:18:29,282 --> 00:18:32,752
Listen, everyone. Don't even
think about trying to defeat her.

235
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:35,479
If we're not careful, we'll be stuck here forever.

236
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:39,466
The underworld is Izanami's realm.

237
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:43,915
We're here for the Yato god.
When we have him, we leave at once.

238
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:44,725
Right!

239
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:50,406
How dare you! I was having a
lovely tea party with my friend.

240
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:53,370
You interrupted us!

241
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,801
Impressive. It's no wonder
she's known as the supreme war god.

242
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,213
Still...

243
00:19:07,777 --> 00:19:12,844
Nothing happened? But how is that possible?
A blow that strong and it did nothing?

244
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,768
We're in big trouble!

245
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:18,692
Everyone focus! We all need to work together now!

246
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:19,755
Right!

247
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:23,385
Fools! You shouldn't have come.

248
00:19:23,634 --> 00:19:28,121
Hurry! Get outta here! If you're
looking for Ebisu, he left. I helped him.

249
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,329
He should be safe.

250
00:19:29,354 --> 00:19:32,546
Be quiet! You suicidal maniac!

251
00:19:32,853 --> 00:19:34,588
Don't you want to be rescued?

252
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,685
Rescued? What are you...?

253
00:19:39,382 --> 00:19:48,412
Yato god. I have hated you to the core of my being. I
loathed you, and I loathed myself for being saved by you.

254
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:55,880
But whatever I've said before, you weren't
to blame for the deaths of the Ma and Ha clans.

255
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:58,795
I have actually known that all along.

256
00:20:00,063 --> 00:20:01,877
Their deaths were my fault.

257
00:20:04,025 --> 00:20:08,346
Yato god! I hated you because it
was all I could do to keep going!

258
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,417
In spite of that, you've saved me twice.

259
00:20:13,854 --> 00:20:19,360
Are you telling me you came all this way
to say "thank you"? You're freakin' crazy!

260
00:20:20,405 --> 00:20:26,962
You can say whatever you want about me, but
I always pay my debts. That is why I am here!

261
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:39,734
You famous gods are only so brave
and daring because you can reincarnate!

262
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:48,105
Do not think me so complacent! I don't
wish to die. I'll fight to remain who I am!

263
00:20:48,858 --> 00:20:49,786
Veena.

264
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:57,488
Yato god, hear me well! Your friends
await you outside. Yukine and Hiyori Iki.

265
00:20:59,022 --> 00:21:02,644
That's right! So don't you give up!

266
00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:06,473
They're waiting...

267
00:21:08,486 --> 00:21:11,954
Hiyori and Yukine. They're waiting for me!

268
00:21:20,566 --> 00:21:22,324
My lady, let's try again.

269
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:26,861
Bore!

270
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:33,858
It's no use! The Vent is just closing right back up.

271
00:21:33,883 --> 00:21:35,995
Damn it! They won't have a way out!

272
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:38,044
Please, Milady.

273
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:42,168
Yato.

274
00:21:42,983 --> 00:21:43,829
Bore!

275
00:21:52,406 --> 00:21:53,302
Yato.

276
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:56,827
A Blessed Vessel and a human girl.

277
00:21:57,918 --> 00:22:03,515
I see. They are his purpose.
They are why he keeps fighting.

278
00:22:05,347 --> 00:22:06,265
He's awoken!

279
00:22:07,846 --> 00:22:09,722
Ebi! Are you okay?

280
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:17,212
You can help Yato. If you wish to bring
him back from the underworld, there's a way.

281
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:23,870
However, not just anyone will do. It requires a human.

282
00:23:55,818 --> 00:23:56,735
Hm.

283
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,093
What's wrong, Kazuma?

284
00:23:58,118 --> 00:24:02,091
I can't decide if your bath should be 105 or 106 degrees.

285
00:24:02,116 --> 00:24:05,944
On the next Noragami Aragoto: "Your Voice Calls Out."

286
00:24:05,969 --> 00:24:06,896
What do you think?

287
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:09,396
Honestly? I don't much care either way.
