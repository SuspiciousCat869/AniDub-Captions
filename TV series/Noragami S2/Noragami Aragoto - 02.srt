1
00:00:02,508 --> 00:00:06,500
Hm. Yes. This one absorbs water the best.

2
00:00:06,883 --> 00:00:08,127
Hope you don't mind, tree.

3
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:13,508
Your sap is what I need.

4
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:15,297
For making pills, there's none better.

5
00:00:17,424 --> 00:00:20,061
So. We meet again, Kugaha.

6
00:00:21,341 --> 00:00:23,096
Ah. Hello, Norry.

7
00:00:23,183 --> 00:00:26,299
Don't call me by that name. I don't like it.

8
00:00:26,383 --> 00:00:28,592
Really? What should I call you instead, then?

9
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,610
There are plenty of options.

10
00:00:34,997 --> 00:00:36,818
You have quite a sense of humor.

11
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:40,797
By the way, that Yato fellow. I paid him a visit.

12
00:00:41,382 --> 00:00:43,561
And? Your conclusion?

13
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:46,598
I think he'll be useful.

14
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,901
What's going on? Those two usually don't act so serious.

15
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,750
Yato, I need to talk to you.

16
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:28,063
Oh, yeah? About what?

17
00:02:30,388 --> 00:02:34,577
Oh, no! Are they breaking up?
Has Yukki finally had it with Yatty?

18
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:37,799
Try not to cry for him. Yato deserves this.

19
00:02:37,883 --> 00:02:40,014
I have no doubt he brought it on himself.

20
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:41,303
I...

21
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:42,929
Go on.

22
00:02:43,691 --> 00:02:45,599
I... I think

23
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,143
I think I made a new friend!

24
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:54,091
Aw! How sweet!

25
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,081
Oh? Good for him. That's wonderful!

26
00:03:02,112 --> 00:03:04,328
Is this his first friend as a Regalia?

27
00:03:04,508 --> 00:03:06,025
Are they about the same age?

28
00:03:06,257 --> 00:03:08,424
I don't know how thrilled I am about this.

29
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,530
The kid is just too easily distracted.

30
00:03:10,862 --> 00:03:14,674
I'm relieved to see that Yukine is
thriving, even with a subpar master.

31
00:03:15,627 --> 00:03:18,498
Maybe he looks to Yato as an example of what not to do.

32
00:03:19,863 --> 00:03:21,216
Well, good for Yukine.

33
00:03:21,558 --> 00:03:23,299
Who does this friend of his serve?

34
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:24,758
Oh. Good question.

35
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:26,505
As on the ball as ever, I see.

36
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:28,924
Do you always have to insult me, Tomone?

37
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,392
You know it's Mayu now!

38
00:03:30,552 --> 00:03:33,249
And I'm not insulting you, just stating the truth.

39
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:36,951
Anyhow. What an excellent development.

40
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,504
Yukine had a rough time of it at first.
He seemed like a rather troubled young man.

41
00:03:42,298 --> 00:03:45,867
No kidding. He's got father issues of his own.

42
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:48,020
His own issues?

43
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:53,716
Rend!

44
00:03:57,991 --> 00:04:00,486
Great job! It only took one hit!

45
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:02,123
Revert, Yuki.

46
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:05,309
She's right, that was a good job.

47
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:06,390
I can tell you're really

48
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:09,174
Hey! Listen to me when I'm praising you!

49
00:04:09,258 --> 00:04:10,799
Sorry! I'll listen later!

50
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:11,853
Where are you going?

51
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:13,508
To see my friend!

52
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:15,883
Don't forget about your homework, Yukine.

53
00:04:15,962 --> 00:04:17,633
I'll do that later, too.

54
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,682
That punk. Ditching his master.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,301
Aw, just let him go.

56
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:24,258
You finished your subcontract work for Lord Tenjin.

57
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:26,008
Don't call it that, okay?

58
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:27,466
We helped him. Helped him.

59
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:28,648
Sure, sure!

60
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,700
Just look at him. He's so happy lately.

61
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:35,210
Suzuha!

62
00:04:35,724 --> 00:04:37,660
Hey! How are you?

63
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:40,799
Sorry I'm so late.

64
00:04:40,883 --> 00:04:43,361
Don't worry about it. You're the one helping me out.

65
00:04:43,753 --> 00:04:46,424
How 'bout I get you my master's autograph as a thank you?

66
00:04:46,508 --> 00:04:48,330
Nah! That's okay!

67
00:04:48,577 --> 00:04:50,724
What's your master's name again? Lord Yato?

68
00:04:50,878 --> 00:04:54,358
I'll have her make it out:
"To Yato and Yukine, with love!"

69
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,591
Uh, no, seriously!

70
00:04:55,626 --> 00:04:56,154
I'm good.

71
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:57,379
Aw! Don't be like that!

72
00:04:58,503 --> 00:05:01,904
If he'd ever heard of Yato,
he wouldn't be suggesting that.

73
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:05,150
Wow. Your master gave you all of this?

74
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:07,549
Sure. All the fertilizer and seedlings I want.

75
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:09,685
Man! You've really got it good, you know that?

76
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:12,049
My stupid master never gives me stuff.

77
00:05:12,141 --> 00:05:14,314
He actually stole money from me once!

78
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:16,971
A real jerk move, but I got back at 'im!

79
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,895
You guys are close, huh?

80
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:20,315
How do you figure that?

81
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:23,528
My master is totally amazing, but she's got lots of us.

82
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,382
Including her super-talented go-to team.

83
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:30,456
Kuraha, the divine beast. Akiha, the knife.

84
00:05:30,674 --> 00:05:33,413
Karuha and Kazuha, the handguns.

85
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:37,483
Yugiha, the great sword. Kinuha, the whip.

86
00:05:37,658 --> 00:05:39,863
And Tsuguha, in charge of defense.

87
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,401
Jeez, that's a lot.

88
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,193
Of course, there's also the Blessed Vessel and exemplar.

89
00:05:44,308 --> 00:05:46,288
Kazuma holds them all together.

90
00:05:48,122 --> 00:05:49,549
Blessed Vessel, huh?

91
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:53,306
They're all elite soldiers ready to
rush into battle at a moment's notice.

92
00:05:53,504 --> 00:05:58,179
Together, they're the ultimate team of
Regalia for the ultimate god of war, Bishamon!

93
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:04,647
They're the top, but the master is
still really nice to all the rest of us.

94
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:07,391
Even with so many, she treats us like family.

95
00:06:08,006 --> 00:06:11,002
That's the sort of god she is. Powerful and kind.

96
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:13,549
Sounds like a great master.

97
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:15,299
I can tell you really respect her.

98
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:16,359
Of course I do!

99
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:23,216
But, considering how many Regalia she
has, I haven't been called up in years.

100
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:23,851
Oh.

101
00:06:24,938 --> 00:06:27,515
Hey, I know! You wanna see something cool?

102
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:29,727
It's huge!

103
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:35,891
This cherry tree was uprooted during a typhoon,
and it got sick. I've been taking care of it.

104
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:40,924
The hollow's finally growing roots again. See?

105
00:06:41,008 --> 00:06:43,155
That is cool! You did this yourself?

106
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:45,549
I did have a little advice from an expert.

107
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:48,723
This is a pretty big tree, too. It must've been tough.

108
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,734
I guess. A friend and I made a promise, though.

109
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:54,596
That we'd see its blossoms together.

110
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:57,186
Oh. Another Regalia?

111
00:06:57,852 --> 00:06:59,174
No, actually.

112
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:01,973
She was a living person, but she could see me.

113
00:07:04,352 --> 00:07:06,204
How long ago was this?

114
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,960
It's been about 30 years now.

115
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:14,330
The flowers around here are so big and pretty!

116
00:07:14,591 --> 00:07:16,924
Are you the one who takes care of them, mister?

117
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,127
These are sunflowers.

118
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,997
And those are morning glories.

119
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,743
Not bad! You know your flowers, kid.

120
00:07:24,822 --> 00:07:26,841
Don't call me kid! I'm Tomoko!

121
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:30,205
Okay, Tomoko. What's this red one here?

122
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,330
A doodle-doo!

123
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:35,449
I don't think so. I'm pretty sure
these flowers are called hollyhocks.

124
00:07:35,965 --> 00:07:41,242
Cock-a-doodle-doo! Cock-a-doodle-doo!

125
00:07:42,987 --> 00:07:45,585
The flower garden here is always so pretty!

126
00:07:46,016 --> 00:07:48,271
Are you the one who looks after them, mister?

127
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:50,216
Hello, Tomoko!

128
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:50,834
Huh?

129
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:53,878
How do you know my name? Have I met you before?

130
00:07:56,082 --> 00:07:58,557
These flowers are so beautiful every year!

131
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:00,519
So, is this your garden?

132
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,735
Tomoko's grandmother lived nearby. So
she came to visit every summer vacation.

133
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:14,084
A butterbur cup, and a thistle basket!

134
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:16,694
You're really good at remembering flower names.

135
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:19,788
Is there anything else you remember?

136
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,924
Doodle-doo!

137
00:08:23,193 --> 00:08:25,101
But she could never remember me.

138
00:08:26,655 --> 00:08:28,843
She only ever came to visit during the summer.

139
00:08:29,337 --> 00:08:32,882
But one time, she said she wanted
to see the cherry blossoms with me.

140
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:35,552
So we carved a promise into the tree.

141
00:08:36,947 --> 00:08:38,433
I haven't seen her since.

142
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,749
That's how it goes.

143
00:08:43,184 --> 00:08:45,250
The living forget us so quickly.

144
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:49,196
But, I'm hoping, at least, she remembers this cherry tree.

145
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:51,546
That would be enough for me.

146
00:09:02,062 --> 00:09:04,276
What are you doing coming in through the window?

147
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:07,549
Well, if I came in through the
door, Daikoku would make me do chores.

148
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:10,258
Then do some! Don't you owe them that much?

149
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,622
Forget that for now.

150
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:13,411
Did anything happen with you today?

151
00:09:13,627 --> 00:09:15,692
I've had a pain here for hours.

152
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:18,203
It's none of your business.

153
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,245
Please don't give me that. Just talk to me.

154
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,365
I don't think either of us want a
repeat of what happened last time.

155
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,448
Fine. It's about Hiyori.

156
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:30,378
Hm?

157
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:32,827
She's a living person.

158
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:36,131
When she gets older, will she forget us?

159
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,674
You falling for her?

160
00:09:39,758 --> 00:09:42,964
Shut up! It's not like that.

161
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,617
I didn't think much about her at first.

162
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:49,153
She was just someone who seemed handy to have around.

163
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:50,555
But...

164
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,424
What are you waiting for?

165
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,924
Then I can't be friends with you anymore!

166
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:59,386
I'm so relieved! I'm so glad you're both okay!

167
00:09:59,554 --> 00:10:00,988
She's more than that.

168
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,467
She always tries so hard to help us.

169
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,002
But, it seems like a waste of her time.

170
00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:10,434
What do I matter? I'm already dead.

171
00:10:10,974 --> 00:10:12,729
I might as well never existed.

172
00:10:13,394 --> 00:10:15,997
Why do so much to help somebody like me?

173
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:23,184
I mean, really. Why bother? What's the point, anyway?

174
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,579
She's gonna keep getting older, isn't she?

175
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,167
She'll go off to school, get a job.

176
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:31,008
Someday, she'll get married.

177
00:10:31,091 --> 00:10:33,748
She'll keep changing, and I'll always be the same.

178
00:10:34,362 --> 00:10:35,742
That's fine, really.

179
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:37,849
I knew it would be like that.

180
00:10:38,406 --> 00:10:41,357
I was hoping that we would stay friends.

181
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:48,764
But... But what if she forgets us,
and doesn't even remember who we are?

182
00:10:54,984 --> 00:10:56,694
Sorry. Does it hurt?

183
00:10:57,719 --> 00:11:00,812
Eh, don't worry. It's better not to hold it all in.

184
00:11:00,946 --> 00:11:02,670
You just cry all you need to.

185
00:11:03,987 --> 00:11:06,446
Seems like being around her might be hard for you.

186
00:11:08,124 --> 00:11:09,263
You gonna quit studying?

187
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:13,410
No, I'm not. I don't want to quit.

188
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:16,298
Even though this might be my cherry tree.

189
00:11:16,922 --> 00:11:18,139
Your cherry tree?

190
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,165
It's hard to explain.

191
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:25,538
By the way, Suzuha's having a blossom viewing
party soon, and he invited me to go to it.

192
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:28,902
Suzuha? That's your friend?

193
00:11:29,328 --> 00:11:32,407
Uh-huh. He's one of Bishamon's Regalia.

194
00:11:40,632 --> 00:11:42,595
It's taken root beautifully.

195
00:11:43,008 --> 00:11:43,797
Hi, Doctor.

196
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:46,593
It's going to bloom just fine this year.

197
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:48,467
Thanks to all your hard work.

198
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,762
Well, thank you. But, I just did what you told me to do.

199
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:56,109
So, all sad and alone again this year?

200
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:56,865
Wha...?

201
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,498
How long are you going to keep this up?

202
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:02,817
For decades? For centuries?

203
00:12:03,008 --> 00:12:05,144
I mean, surely it's obvious by now.

204
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:07,960
She forgot you a long time ago.

205
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:11,347
And she isn't the only one, is she?

206
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:16,292
How long has it been since Lady Bishamon
called your name? Years now, right?

207
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:18,905
Even your master has forgotten you.

208
00:12:19,334 --> 00:12:20,985
That must be pretty depressing.

209
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:23,732
You're totally alone in the world.

210
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:28,111
There's nothing for you here. Why stay?

211
00:12:53,498 --> 00:12:55,144
A name has disappeared.

212
00:12:55,805 --> 00:12:59,455
That would only happen if one of my Regalia died.

213
00:13:00,168 --> 00:13:01,425
But how?

214
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:08,549
It's unwrapped. I wonder what Suzuha was thinking.

215
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:12,009
You can't just leave it exposed.
He knows better than that.

216
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:13,431
Jeez.

217
00:13:13,557 --> 00:13:15,476
Hold on a sec. I'll help you.

218
00:13:16,017 --> 00:13:17,379
I hope he shows up.

219
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:21,111
You even made food for us. I wonder why he's not here yet.

220
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:22,565
Suzuha...

221
00:13:22,657 --> 00:13:26,047
So he's one of Lady Bishamon's Regalia, right?

222
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,216
And that's not a problem?

223
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:29,591
It's really no big deal.

224
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:31,875
He's actually never even heard of Yato.

225
00:13:31,964 --> 00:13:35,008
And I was told I should just
"run along now and play nice."

226
00:13:35,095 --> 00:13:36,748
Like I'm a five-year-old or something.

227
00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:39,841
Now I get it.

228
00:13:39,924 --> 00:13:42,746
He's a lot more worried about Yukine than he lets on.

229
00:13:43,236 --> 00:13:45,299
Which explains all these texts.

230
00:13:45,383 --> 00:13:48,396
We're gonna have a blossom-viewing
party in the spring when it blooms.

231
00:13:48,644 --> 00:13:49,958
You can come if you want.

232
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:51,548
Really? I'd like to.

233
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:54,929
You might forget. It's not for a little while.

234
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,647
Don't say that. I won't forget.

235
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:01,412
Yato still hasn't fixed my body.

236
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,304
And I've got a ton of stuff left to teach you.

237
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:06,235
Keep studying with me, okay?

238
00:14:18,444 --> 00:14:20,883
You hungry? Should we eat now?

239
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:23,008
That sounds good. Just give me a minute, okay?

240
00:14:23,091 --> 00:14:23,509
Hm?

241
00:14:23,927 --> 00:14:27,341
"If you have some leftovers, don't be greedy.

242
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:31,416
"Remember gods gotta eat, too." And send!

243
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:34,341
Quit being a dirty sneak!

244
00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:38,659
You wanna say something? Say it to my face!

245
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:41,216
Was that a tracksuit I saw?

246
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:41,795
Hmph.

247
00:14:42,312 --> 00:14:43,924
Did he follow us here or something?

248
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,144
Oh, who knows?

249
00:14:45,756 --> 00:14:50,534
Never mind that idiot, Yukine.
I'm hungry. Let's eat our lunch.

250
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:55,008
Suzuha told me he's been taking
care of that cherry tree all this time.

251
00:14:55,724 --> 00:14:56,634
Wow.

252
00:14:57,153 --> 00:14:59,674
It means a lot to him. That's why I don't get it.

253
00:15:00,148 --> 00:15:01,568
He should be here now.

254
00:15:13,472 --> 00:15:15,976
The flowers. Was it Suzuha?

255
00:15:18,686 --> 00:15:21,799
This is bad. Suzuha hasn't come back.

256
00:15:21,883 --> 00:15:22,883
Don't cry about it.

257
00:15:22,966 --> 00:15:24,549
You know crying makes the master hurt.

258
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,071
Do you think a Phantom got him?

259
00:15:26,747 --> 00:15:27,883
Can you help me?

260
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:31,027
Of course, my lady.

261
00:15:33,028 --> 00:15:35,989
The three of you spend a lot
of time with Suzuha, don't you?

262
00:15:36,155 --> 00:15:37,750
Do you know where he might be?

263
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,582
No, I'm sorry.

264
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,181
Everything's just fine, my lady.
There's nothing to worry about.

265
00:15:45,455 --> 00:15:46,730
Okay, thanks.

266
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:51,304
Tsuguha? What happened to your hair?

267
00:15:51,896 --> 00:15:53,458
Nothing, my lady.

268
00:15:53,483 --> 00:15:55,674
Please, you seem shaken. Has something happened?

269
00:15:55,758 --> 00:15:57,716
No, of course not! I'm just being silly.

270
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,558
Getting upset over a bad haircut!

271
00:15:59,846 --> 00:16:02,478
I hope it didn't affect your health at all.

272
00:16:03,056 --> 00:16:05,725
Well, I'm all better. I should get going.

273
00:16:18,925 --> 00:16:20,742
She's taking more medication.

274
00:16:21,054 --> 00:16:23,949
She seems so melancholy and run down lately.

275
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:32,484
Veena.

276
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,016
Why are we gathering so late at night?

277
00:16:44,206 --> 00:16:47,023
It looks as though every Regalia's been summoned.

278
00:16:47,794 --> 00:16:49,199
Ah. What's going on here?

279
00:16:49,516 --> 00:16:50,834
Is this what I think it is?

280
00:16:52,324 --> 00:16:54,434
We are holding an ablution tonight.

281
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,056
Know that I do this on my own authority, as your exemplar.

282
00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:01,953
Our master has no knowledge of it.

283
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:06,073
The Lady Bishamon has been blighted.

284
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:11,241
Which means one of us has been
corrupted, and thus, brought her harm.

285
00:17:12,373 --> 00:17:16,857
A Phantom must have manifested on the
body of the one responsible for the blight.

286
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:20,222
I ask you to show yourself.

287
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:27,049
All right.

288
00:17:27,252 --> 00:17:29,116
Then we'll have to inspect everyone.

289
00:17:29,952 --> 00:17:32,954
Please cooperate. For our lady's sake.

290
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:35,565
Dr. Kuga, if you will?

291
00:17:40,012 --> 00:17:41,660
All clear. Next.

292
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:48,198
All clear.

293
00:17:50,127 --> 00:17:51,133
You're clear, Aiha.

294
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:53,694
You're clear, too.

295
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:56,156
Well, I examined everyone.

296
00:17:56,812 --> 00:17:59,029
Not a Regalia among us seems to be tainted.

297
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,015
Are you satisfied, then? Are we done?

298
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,158
Actually. There's still one left.

299
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,825
You haven't been checked.

300
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:10,035
Ah. Of course. You're right.

301
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:12,321
Well, that's easy enough to remedy.

302
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:18,191
Uh...

303
00:18:20,478 --> 00:18:21,819
There! Feast your eyes!

304
00:18:21,914 --> 00:18:23,526
Dr. Kugaha! There are ladies present!

305
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,133
Pristine, isn't it?

306
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:26,355
Kinuha! Stop staring! Cover your eyes!

307
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:29,341
But then who has blighted her?

308
00:18:29,366 --> 00:18:30,257
I don't know.

309
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,546
But I can't believe you suspected us.

310
00:18:32,952 --> 00:18:38,603
I'll agree that she has seemed exhausted lately,
and no one can blame you for being concerned.

311
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:42,450
But don't forget your responsibilities
as our master's exemplar, Kazuma.

312
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:46,472
We can't afford to have you
distracted or suspicious of us.

313
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:51,698
When we see your confidence
begin to waver, it shakes us all.

314
00:18:53,187 --> 00:18:54,532
What's going on here?

315
00:18:54,757 --> 00:18:56,105
My Lady Bishamon!

316
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,368
Oh, err, we were just

317
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:03,498
The blight is gone. But how?

318
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:09,969
Wait. So he had it wrong the whole time?

319
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:15,592
I'm glad Lady Bishamon is okay, but I
can't believe Kazuma had so little trust in us.

320
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,053
I knew it.

321
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:26,704
It's not much, but it's stormy here.

322
00:19:27,104 --> 00:19:29,557
So, what happened? If it's what I suspect...

323
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:38,145
You really reek of dog. Did you kill him?

324
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:43,130
It isn't good to be so suspicious
and mistrustful all the time.

325
00:19:43,604 --> 00:19:45,419
Such traits can prove fatal.

326
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:48,991
Especially for denizens of the Far Shore, like us.

327
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,376
Wouldn't you agree?

328
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,001
Who are you?

329
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:54,932
Oh, nobody special.

330
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:58,085
Just someone who wanted to meet the great Yato in person.

331
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,001
Not gonna give me a name?

332
00:20:00,746 --> 00:20:03,075
What for? I'm just an ordinary Regalia.

333
00:20:03,297 --> 00:20:04,760
Do you really need my name?

334
00:20:05,373 --> 00:20:07,056
I'll ask a different question.

335
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,366
Why don't you tell me whose pet you are.

336
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,790
There's some real fire in you, isn't there?

337
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:16,660
That said, Lord Yato.

338
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:22,134
It doesn't matter how many petty
wishes you grant. You're a nobody.

339
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,399
No one will ever remember you.

340
00:20:24,715 --> 00:20:27,738
I bet you must live in constant fear.

341
00:20:28,084 --> 00:20:30,056
Without a Regalia, what are you?

342
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:33,092
Just a pathetic excuse for a god!

343
00:20:44,197 --> 00:20:47,535
Did your master teach you to greet
an unarmed person with a Borderline?

344
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:50,219
That's really horrible manners, you know.

345
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:58,216
You don't have a single shrine, but you're that powerful?

346
00:20:58,545 --> 00:21:02,471
You must have a particularly strong tie to the Near Shore.

347
00:21:08,318 --> 00:21:10,633
Bonds with the Near Shore can be fleeting.

348
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:13,579
Also remarkably fragile, as I'm sure you're aware.

349
00:21:14,012 --> 00:21:18,032
Ephemeral. I think perhaps that's
the best way to describe it, don't you?

350
00:21:18,806 --> 00:21:21,045
I hope we'll meet again sometime, Lord Yato.

351
00:21:21,273 --> 00:21:25,481
And please, until we do, try not to fade away, all right?

352
00:21:26,136 --> 00:21:29,483
That's no problem! I'm not gonna disappear!

353
00:21:29,718 --> 00:21:36,263
Not as long as there's someone out
there who still... remembers who I am.

354
00:21:42,905 --> 00:21:45,633
Well, it looks like somebody taught you a lesson.

355
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:48,049
Oh, yes.

356
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:50,306
I think Yato's exactly what I've been looking for.

357
00:21:51,354 --> 00:21:54,030
Everything is falling into place perfectly.

358
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:58,659
The Regalias' bonds are already
unraveling and growing hollow.

359
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:02,589
Many are ready to fall with only the slightest of nudges.

360
00:22:03,347 --> 00:22:06,574
Bishamon is known for being a violent god of war.

361
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:10,976
Unfortunately, she is no longer
living up to her reputation.

362
00:22:11,312 --> 00:22:14,415
Like it or not, you're going to help me, Yato god.

363
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,063
Oh, really? It's happening?

364
00:22:17,361 --> 00:22:21,349
It is. The end is near for Bishamon.

365
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:22,805
Very near, indeed.

366
00:23:55,337 --> 00:23:57,883
Can you tell me how to solve this equation, Mayu?

367
00:23:57,966 --> 00:24:00,883
Of course I can! I do serve the god of learning, you know!

368
00:24:00,966 --> 00:24:02,174
Great, thank you!

369
00:24:02,258 --> 00:24:04,633
I think I'll call you Lady Mayu from now on!

370
00:24:04,716 --> 00:24:07,091
On the next Noragami Aragoto: "False Bond."

371
00:24:07,174 --> 00:24:09,701
You've never once called me Lord Yato!
