1
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:05,274
Ah!

2
00:00:08,206 --> 00:00:09,384
Stop.

3
00:00:10,962 --> 00:00:14,879
Stop. Please don't kill them.

4
00:00:14,962 --> 00:00:16,212
My lady! Help!

5
00:00:16,295 --> 00:00:17,670
Please, my lady!

6
00:00:17,754 --> 00:00:19,129
Lady Bishamoan!

7
00:00:19,212 --> 00:00:20,564
No!

8
00:00:39,803 --> 00:00:40,826
Yato.

9
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,504
Hello there, and thank you for calling!

10
00:02:16,587 --> 00:02:20,746
Fast and affordable, Delivery God Yato at your service!

11
00:02:21,504 --> 00:02:23,428
Damn. It keeps slipping.

12
00:02:23,837 --> 00:02:27,170
Yes, of course! I'd be more than happy to accept the job!

13
00:02:27,254 --> 00:02:29,504
I can't do these handwritten fliers, Yato...

14
00:02:29,587 --> 00:02:30,462
Right!

15
00:02:32,212 --> 00:02:34,041
Put down the pen. We've got work!

16
00:02:43,603 --> 00:02:44,438
There!

17
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,462
Hiyori! Breakfast is ready!

18
00:02:46,545 --> 00:02:47,482
I'm coming!

19
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,169
Good morning, Mom. Good morning, Dad. Did you sleep well?

20
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,256
Not too bad.

21
00:02:52,335 --> 00:02:54,212
Yes, thank you, dear. Now, come eat.

22
00:02:54,295 --> 00:02:56,712
I opened that jam we got as a year-end gift.

23
00:02:56,795 --> 00:02:57,611
Oh, yummy!

24
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,254
I hear that you did well on your practice exam.

25
00:03:01,096 --> 00:03:03,295
The actual exam is what matters, though.

26
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:05,219
You wouldn't wanna be held back a grade!

27
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:07,203
See you later!

28
00:03:07,405 --> 00:03:08,803
There's no need to run!

29
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:10,282
Hello there, Hiyori!

30
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:12,129
Oh, good morning, Miss Sasaki.

31
00:03:12,283 --> 00:03:13,339
Have a good day!

32
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:17,985
Morning! Staying warm?

33
00:03:18,184 --> 00:03:21,045
I'm trying, Ami. Hey, where's Yama?

34
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:22,962
She headed in early, the poor thing.

35
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:25,337
Sounds like she bombed the practice exam.

36
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,291
Oh, really?

37
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:28,007
Hey, Yama!

38
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:29,545
Yori! Perfect timing!

39
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:30,531
Why's that?

40
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:31,976
Do you know the answer to this one?

41
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:33,780
Oh, this is a hard one.

42
00:03:34,254 --> 00:03:36,485
Let's see. If I remember right...

43
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:39,420
Thank you. With your help, maybe I'll actually pass.

44
00:03:39,504 --> 00:03:41,379
You can teach me everything I need to know.

45
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:42,182
My secret weapon!

46
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:46,295
Be careful, though. Trying to learn too
much, too quickly, can backfire on you.

47
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:47,712
Yeah, you're right.

48
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:51,758
With my luck I'd cram all night only to
fall asleep during the exam the next day!

49
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:52,837
Uh, Hiyori?

50
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,335
Huh?

51
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,903
Ah-ha! Hiyori's patented Insta-Snooze trick!

52
00:03:58,295 --> 00:04:01,545
Man, I really hope she doesn't do this during the test.

53
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:03,170
Rise and shine, Hiyori!

54
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:05,544
Great. Looks like my soul slipped out again.

55
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,051
Oh, well. What do you say we go for a walk?

56
00:04:25,027 --> 00:04:27,889
Smells nice. Is that...?

57
00:04:33,402 --> 00:04:36,379
Have you prepared yourself? Because the time has come.

58
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:39,509
Here we go! Almost there! And...

59
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:40,989
Clean baby!

60
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,379
Oh, wow. You mean you actually know how to change diapers?

61
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:47,200
That was nothing compared to changing a cloth diaper.

62
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:50,254
Are you that surprised, though? I've
been around for a long time, you know.

63
00:04:50,337 --> 00:04:51,905
Who'd let you near their baby?

64
00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:53,795
Hey guys! Can I come in?

65
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:55,004
Hiyori!

66
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,862
I'm not interrupting, am I?

67
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:58,972
You sure slip out of your body a lot.

68
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:01,459
How'd you know where to find us?

69
00:05:02,697 --> 00:05:04,545
You doing some Delivery God work?

70
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:07,781
Yeah. Yato the babysitter god, at your service.

71
00:05:08,504 --> 00:05:11,787
I guess his parents are sleep
deprived because he cries all the time.

72
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:15,620
Really? He's not crying now. He seems perfectly happy.

73
00:05:15,887 --> 00:05:17,474
For the moment, sure.

74
00:05:18,087 --> 00:05:19,550
Where's his mom, anyway?

75
00:05:20,013 --> 00:05:21,703
Snoring it up in the other room.

76
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,811
Can't blame her. She hasn't gotten any sleep in a week.

77
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:28,295
Hey, he's laughing!

78
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:30,965
He's looking your direction. I guess he can see you.

79
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,494
Actually, it's pretty normal for animals and young
children to perceive those of us from the Far Shore.

80
00:05:38,996 --> 00:05:40,515
His skin's so soft.

81
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:44,303
He likes you. I think he's asking you to pick him up.

82
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:44,942
Huh?

83
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,795
Uh... Oh! He's heavy! And why's he squirming? It's freaky!

84
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,629
Here. Put your left hand on his back.

85
00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:55,129
Support his head and neck with your whole
arm, and put your right hand underneath.

86
00:05:55,212 --> 00:05:56,906
O-O-Okay. Like this?

87
00:06:02,293 --> 00:06:04,822
What did I do wrong? Why is he crying?

88
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:27,629
We have company!

89
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:28,553
A Phantom?

90
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:36,848
Let's go! Jungle Savate!

91
00:06:38,754 --> 00:06:41,504
Nice one! Hiyori, keep an eye on the kid for me.

92
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,504
Huh?

93
00:06:42,587 --> 00:06:43,591
Come, Sekki!

94
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,496
Ready, Yukine?

95
00:06:51,587 --> 00:06:52,557
What? No!

96
00:06:58,368 --> 00:06:59,962
You're sharper than I realized!

97
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:02,595
Wait a second! The room's too cramped.

98
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,424
Don't forget, there's a baby in here!

99
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,721
I commend you for being concerned.

100
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:11,216
We must take care not to cause
undue harm to those of this world.

101
00:07:11,335 --> 00:07:12,597
You'll need to hold back.

102
00:07:12,988 --> 00:07:14,433
Great. How do I do that?

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,459
Let's review, shall we?

104
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:18,629
You draw a Borderline.

105
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:21,582
A line between what gets killed and what survives.

106
00:07:22,397 --> 00:07:25,604
What, or who, I kill is up to you. Understand?

107
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:29,529
Yeah, I think so.

108
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,982
This Phantom is acting really weird!

109
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,115
It's... healing itself?

110
00:07:40,988 --> 00:07:42,337
The kid's doing it.

111
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:43,376
But how?

112
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:46,004
The mirror. This Phantom is just an image.

113
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:49,478
One created by the kid himself. See what he's doing?

114
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,533
He probably wanted somebody to play with.

115
00:07:52,668 --> 00:07:55,565
So he kept reaching out to his
own reflection in the mirror.

116
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:00,641
The longing and vulnerability that
poured out of him summoned a Phantom.

117
00:08:02,226 --> 00:08:08,097
Unless we do something to stop it, it will
eventually possess his mother, stealing her humanity.

118
00:08:08,273 --> 00:08:09,719
That's awful!

119
00:08:10,882 --> 00:08:15,136
I have to say, this thought energy
seems unusually strong for a baby.

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,744
Okay, then. What do we do?

121
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:21,383
We slay the real one... The one in the mirror.

122
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:25,170
Keep the baby there, Hiyori.
He needs to see his reflection.

123
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,250
'Kay. Got it.

124
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:35,588
This is the land of the Rising Sun.

125
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:37,945
Your desecrations shall not be allowed.

126
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:41,026
Hear me. I am the god, Yato.

127
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:45,573
I now lay thee waste with the
Sekki, and expel thy vast defilement!

128
00:08:45,788 --> 00:08:47,640
I cleanse thee!

129
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:49,525
Rend!

130
00:09:00,797 --> 00:09:02,720
That was incredible, Yukine!

131
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,109
That's my Regalia for ya!

132
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,233
See, I knew you could do it.

133
00:09:09,587 --> 00:09:11,093
He should be safe now.

134
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,151
Well, that's a relief.

135
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,558
But... What do we do about all this?

136
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:18,254
We scram, obviously.

137
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:19,410
Huh?!

138
00:09:19,628 --> 00:09:20,751
That's horrible Yato!

139
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:21,212
I can't believe you!

140
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:24,882
Especially when you're supposed to
be setting a good example for Yukine.

141
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,202
A mask?

142
00:09:31,552 --> 00:09:33,553
You called for me, Lady Bishamoan?

143
00:09:34,163 --> 00:09:36,598
Yes I did, Kazuma. Please, come in.

144
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,512
How may I help?

145
00:09:40,716 --> 00:09:43,333
How much time do we have remaining until our next patrol?

146
00:09:44,058 --> 00:09:46,606
It's today. We have it planned for the Fiendish Hour.

147
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:49,187
I see. It's almost time then.

148
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:51,307
Is something troubling you?

149
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:55,645
Well, as a matter of fact, I
had an old nightmare this morning.

150
00:09:56,116 --> 00:09:59,249
Clashing with Yato again after
all these years may be to blame.

151
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:01,974
I'm sorry to hear it. Are you all right?

152
00:10:02,473 --> 00:10:04,004
Yes, I'm quite fine.

153
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:06,670
However, I'll need you to locate him again for me.

154
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,780
I must know if we've overlooked anything.

155
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:13,743
Right. Shall I inform the curer, to be safe?

156
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:14,825
Yes.

157
00:10:16,795 --> 00:10:18,045
What? No way!

158
00:10:18,104 --> 00:10:19,120
It's true.

159
00:10:19,216 --> 00:10:22,170
But... I'm sure you cleaned up in the end though, right?

160
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,045
Of course! I insisted. We couldn't leave it like that!

161
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:27,129
You can guess who she made do all the cleaning!

162
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:28,244
Must've been terrible.

163
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:32,295
Show some respect for the working class!

164
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:33,879
You can start by feeding me.

165
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:35,754
I think I'll have grilled eel today.

166
00:10:35,837 --> 00:10:37,513
You don't place orders.

167
00:10:37,712 --> 00:10:40,212
You'll take whatever I give you, and you'll like it!

168
00:10:40,295 --> 00:10:42,879
Ah! I think you punctured a lung!

169
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:45,212
Here, Yukine. You'll need to do this over.

170
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:48,170
And check your work using a dictionary this time, okay?

171
00:10:48,254 --> 00:10:50,133
Uh... Okay.

172
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:52,587
You're such a strict teacher!

173
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,793
Really? Am I?

174
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:56,920
How's he doing, anyway? Does Yukine have some book smarts?

175
00:10:57,004 --> 00:11:00,295
It kinda varies. He's better at some subjects than others.

176
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:02,332
Overall, I'd say he's an eighth grader.

177
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:06,039
Wait! Eighth grade is only one below me!

178
00:11:06,469 --> 00:11:08,707
Oh, jeez. What about that time...?

179
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,087
It's been a while since I slept with someone...

180
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,522
Uh-oh! Maybe he thought I meant slept, slept with someone!

181
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:17,337
What? Is something the matter?

182
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,670
Oh, no. Nothing! Everything's fine.

183
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:22,087
It's just dandy. Nothing's wrong at all!

184
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:26,139
Heh. You try to act mature, but
you're still young in so many ways.

185
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:29,632
Good thing I'm here. Somebody has to look out for you two.

186
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:31,837
You should be thankful.

187
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,373
I may not be a big deal now, but just you wait!

188
00:11:34,464 --> 00:11:37,462
Before much longer, the whole world will know my name!

189
00:11:37,537 --> 00:11:40,409
Yeah! I'll have my own shrine and everything!

190
00:11:42,886 --> 00:11:46,075
Yeah, I dunno. You've been saying
that for over a century now, Yatty.

191
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,920
You're skeptical. I get that.

192
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:51,198
But it's different this time. 'Cause now, I have this!

193
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:54,202
I give. What's it do?

194
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:57,420
A miraculous lucky cat made of magic gemstone!

195
00:11:57,504 --> 00:12:00,840
Its beckoning power is guaranteed
to draw people to the bearer.

196
00:12:01,048 --> 00:12:06,340
It was given to me by one Master Ishizaki,
a fortuneteller who once appeared on TV.

197
00:12:07,337 --> 00:12:09,512
The bottom says it's "made of plastic."

198
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:10,208
Huh?

199
00:12:10,954 --> 00:12:12,462
And it's not beckoning.

200
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:14,879
Look at the paws. It's doing a "hurrah" pose.

201
00:12:14,922 --> 00:12:15,618
What?

202
00:12:15,683 --> 00:12:17,664
Talk about a gullible consumer.

203
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,286
How much did that fortuneteller charge you?

204
00:12:20,472 --> 00:12:21,587
Two hundred thousand.

205
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,820
Wha...?!

206
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,778
How could you blow that much money?

207
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:26,420
That kind of cash...

208
00:12:26,504 --> 00:12:28,212
Wait! Please! I bought it for us!

209
00:12:28,295 --> 00:12:29,504
If my luck improves, so does yours!

210
00:12:29,587 --> 00:12:32,515
Poor Yukki. It must be rough being Yatty's Regalia.

211
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:33,623
Yup.

212
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:36,418
My spleen! You got my spleen...

213
00:12:36,497 --> 00:12:39,550
Aren't you supposed to be putting
your money towards a shrine, Yato?

214
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:42,587
Anyone need the Delivery God?

215
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,863
God-like powers, at your service!

216
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:45,975
Ah, jeeze.

217
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,841
Any job... mildew scrubbing,
diaper changing, even Phantom slaying.

218
00:12:48,897 --> 00:12:50,699
Any job at all, just five yen!

219
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,407
Yato. Look.

220
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:53,993
Huh?

221
00:12:56,545 --> 00:12:57,886
There's a Storm brewing.

222
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:01,645
Hey! What was that for?

223
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:08,446
Hey, that's Bishamon. Right?

224
00:13:09,152 --> 00:13:11,519
Whew. That was a close one.

225
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:14,786
We would be in for a world of hurt if she saw us.

226
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,136
Let's just go this way.

227
00:13:16,554 --> 00:13:18,918
So, I've kinda been wondering.

228
00:13:19,117 --> 00:13:21,284
How long do we have to keep avoiding her?

229
00:13:21,724 --> 00:13:22,273
Huh?

230
00:13:22,407 --> 00:13:25,318
I mean, I owe Kazuma for helping me with the ablution.

231
00:13:25,716 --> 00:13:28,045
I'd like to talk to him and,
you know, maybe say thank you.

232
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:28,818
Yukine.

233
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:32,667
You will stay away from Bishamon.

234
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:42,745
Help me! Someone please help!

235
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,523
A spirit! It's being eaten by Phantoms.

236
00:13:50,843 --> 00:13:52,447
Kuraha. Let's go!

237
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:54,079
Please wait a moment.

238
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:55,985
What is it now?

239
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:58,360
You mean to save another spirit?

240
00:13:58,487 --> 00:13:59,693
Of course I do.

241
00:13:59,891 --> 00:14:01,899
We failed to save her life before.

242
00:14:02,163 --> 00:14:04,878
If I fail her again, what kind of god am I?

243
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,338
Best to target the wings.

244
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:11,360
Gaiki!

245
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,132
Fire!

246
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:15,376
Jinki!

247
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,031
Atop northwest building. Distance: 31!

248
00:14:22,552 --> 00:14:23,433
Suki!

249
00:14:25,635 --> 00:14:26,545
Do it now!

250
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:27,542
Saiki!

251
00:14:28,765 --> 00:14:31,057
This is the land of the Rising Sun.

252
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:33,709
Your desecrations shall not be allowed.

253
00:14:33,861 --> 00:14:35,982
Hear me, I am the god, Bishamon.

254
00:14:36,105 --> 00:14:40,787
I now lay thee waste with the
Saiki, and expel thy vast defilement!

255
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:41,986
I cleanse thee!

256
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:43,692
Ruin!

257
00:14:49,683 --> 00:14:50,818
Revert, Yugi.

258
00:14:52,986 --> 00:14:55,417
She and Kazuma are such a perfect team!

259
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:59,566
Another stellar performance from the mightiest war god.

260
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:01,660
Shuki.

261
00:15:04,205 --> 00:15:05,443
This will hurt a bit.

262
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:08,585
Okay, let's make this quick.

263
00:15:11,336 --> 00:15:15,240
Adhesion between the left biceps,
brachii, and both shoulder blades.

264
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:17,709
Try to avoid tendon damage.

265
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:24,503
Endure.

266
00:15:24,712 --> 00:15:27,800
There is only one way to remove
phantom blight from a spirit.

267
00:15:27,957 --> 00:15:29,301
And that's to cut it out.

268
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:32,809
There. That should be all of it.

269
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,879
Spirit, you are lost and adrift.

270
00:15:42,962 --> 00:15:45,370
You have nowhere to go and nowhere to return to.

271
00:15:45,552 --> 00:15:47,420
Thus, I grant you a place to belong.

272
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:49,764
My name is Bishamon.

273
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,928
Bearing two names, you shall remain here.

274
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,845
With these names, I make thee my servant.

275
00:15:56,423 --> 00:16:01,250
With these names, I use my life to make
thee a Regalia, fit to be wielded by a god.

276
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,087
Thou art Mine!

277
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,644
As Regalia, Ryoki! Come, Ryoki!

278
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:22,682
I don't understand. Why is she a broken mirror?

279
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:27,720
Once it has been torn, the unfortunate
spirit cannot become a proper Regalia.

280
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:28,751
Oh.

281
00:16:30,387 --> 00:16:33,208
That's part of the reason she
goes out of her way to save them.

282
00:16:34,158 --> 00:16:36,708
Wow. She's such a kind god.

283
00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:41,038
Look out, my lady!

284
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,628
Whenever you're ready.

285
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,254
I'm so sick of Yato's crap.

286
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:57,629
Always giving orders without bothering
to listen to me or ask how I feel. Ugh.

287
00:16:57,712 --> 00:16:58,962
No way! Are you serious?

288
00:16:59,045 --> 00:16:59,512
Yeah!

289
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,552
Come by my place if you don't believe me.

290
00:17:01,797 --> 00:17:02,690
Okay, I will!

291
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:04,867
I'm telling you, man, this game is killer.

292
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:11,931
Hey.

293
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,587
Hey. Don't ignore me, kid.

294
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,000
Huh?

295
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,386
Find some place else to sit. You're smashing the flowers.

296
00:17:19,879 --> 00:17:24,189
Huh? U-Uh? Hold on a second. Are you talking to me?

297
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,791
Who else would I be talking to?

298
00:17:25,982 --> 00:17:27,462
But, that means you can see me, though.

299
00:17:27,544 --> 00:17:29,122
How is that even possible?

300
00:17:29,773 --> 00:17:31,795
You're a Regalia, like me, aren't you?

301
00:17:31,863 --> 00:17:32,435
Oh.

302
00:17:36,197 --> 00:17:37,347
Small world, huh?

303
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,359
Revert, Mine.

304
00:17:42,545 --> 00:17:43,868
W-Where are we?

305
00:17:44,077 --> 00:17:45,860
You're in Takamagahara.

306
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,854
This is Lady Bishamon's manor.

307
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:50,701
And as of today, this is where you live, as well.

308
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:51,736
Huh?

309
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:55,545
You are part of the family now. Welcome home.

310
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,291
From this day forward, Mineha, you're one of us.

311
00:18:01,437 --> 00:18:03,714
I expect everyone to treat her warmly.

312
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,987
Yes, Lady Bishamon!

313
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:12,920
Perhaps we ought to have somebody give
you a little tour of the manor. Anybody?

314
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:14,279
Sure! I'll do it.

315
00:18:14,563 --> 00:18:15,476
Tsuguha.

316
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:19,702
I'm still new enough that getting the
chance to explore the manor is fun for me.

317
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:21,613
I see. Well, thank you.

318
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,696
Let's go!

319
00:18:26,932 --> 00:18:27,943
Are you all right?

320
00:18:28,078 --> 00:18:30,047
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

321
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,254
This is all part of being a master.

322
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,126
Regalia are former humans.

323
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:38,664
Although their flesh is gone, their spirits remain.

324
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:43,734
Fear, suspicion, envy, resentment.

325
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:45,927
They feel all these things.

326
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:51,013
And the pain of a Regalia with a
clouded mind is also borne by its master.

327
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:52,782
You mean you've been stung?

328
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:56,189
I believe I told you not to worry about me, didn't I?

329
00:18:56,305 --> 00:18:58,081
Let me worry a little, at least.

330
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:01,485
You have so many Regalia... maybe it's time to slow down.

331
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:04,879
With each new weapon you take on,
you endanger your health that much more.

332
00:19:04,904 --> 00:19:05,969
Anyway, moving on.

333
00:19:06,202 --> 00:19:07,857
What news is there on Yato?

334
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:08,339
Uh.

335
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:10,262
Have you found him?

336
00:19:11,087 --> 00:19:12,476
No, not yet.

337
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:14,807
He's a god of calamity.

338
00:19:15,428 --> 00:19:17,023
I can't let him live.

339
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:19,920
Yuck.

340
00:19:20,004 --> 00:19:22,659
It's very bitter. You should take it more slowly.

341
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,650
Enter.

342
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:32,429
Yes, Kugaha?

343
00:19:33,124 --> 00:19:35,188
I've readied your ritual bath, my lady.

344
00:19:35,595 --> 00:19:36,800
I appreciate it.

345
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:39,096
If you will excuse me, then.

346
00:19:45,545 --> 00:19:47,369
You're looking quite pale today.

347
00:19:48,134 --> 00:19:50,106
Shall I prepare a medicinal bath?

348
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:51,133
Please.

349
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,341
Lady Bishamon.

350
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:54,563
What is it?

351
00:19:55,302 --> 00:19:58,534
I've heard a rumor that I find rather troubling.

352
00:19:58,895 --> 00:20:04,648
Some time back, Kazuma left the manor following a
meeting without informing anyone he was doing so.

353
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:06,935
Perhaps you recall the occasion?

354
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,041
Yes. I do remember that happening.

355
00:20:10,699 --> 00:20:13,700
The rumor I spoke of concerns where he went that day.

356
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:17,909
An ablution ritual.

357
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:21,515
That was apparently held by the calamity god, Yato.

358
00:20:24,385 --> 00:20:25,582
Absurd.

359
00:20:25,871 --> 00:20:29,648
Yes, of course it is. What a ridiculous idea.

360
00:20:31,087 --> 00:20:34,171
Uh-huh. Yeah, sure. Okay!

361
00:20:34,457 --> 00:20:38,360
I'll let him know for you. Hey, Yatty!

362
00:20:38,876 --> 00:20:40,170
That was Yukki calling.

363
00:20:40,254 --> 00:20:41,962
He says he'll be back a little late.

364
00:20:42,045 --> 00:20:42,679
Huh?

365
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:45,545
That darn kid is always goin' off some place.

366
00:20:45,629 --> 00:20:47,587
And it's not very long before dark, either.

367
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,356
Yato.

368
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:52,420
Could you do me a favor and give
this homework to Yukine for me?

369
00:20:52,504 --> 00:20:55,087
I've labeled a few assignments he still needs to do.

370
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,837
Sure, but does that mean you're leaving?

371
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,795
Yes. I need to get home.

372
00:20:58,879 --> 00:21:00,993
I've still got some prep to do for tomorrow.

373
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,686
So, uh, Hiyori.

374
00:21:03,771 --> 00:21:07,107
Have you seen those new
Four-Cheese Melty Buns by any chance?

375
00:21:07,186 --> 00:21:09,337
They sure look tasty, don't they?

376
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:09,971
Huh?

377
00:21:09,995 --> 00:21:10,545
Mm-mm!

378
00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:13,420
They're the kind of thing you have
to try before they're gone forever.

379
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:15,164
You know what I'm talking about!

380
00:21:16,129 --> 00:21:18,337
Yeah. I'll look into it for you.

381
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,376
Cheese bun, score!

382
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:23,098
You haven't forgotten what you're
supposed to be doing for me, have you?

383
00:21:23,254 --> 00:21:23,587
Huh?

384
00:21:23,698 --> 00:21:26,420
I hired you to fix that little issue I'm having.

385
00:21:26,504 --> 00:21:28,629
You know, how my soul slips out of my body!

386
00:21:28,712 --> 00:21:30,212
You said you'd take care of it, remember?

387
00:21:30,295 --> 00:21:32,135
You even took my five-yen coin!

388
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:35,045
Oh, yeah. I'm on it! Totally! No worries.

389
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:37,113
You made me a promise, Yato!

390
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:39,045
You'd better find a way to fix me.

391
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:40,879
I'm sticking with you till you do.

392
00:21:41,912 --> 00:21:43,957
Well, see you tomorrow!

393
00:21:44,705 --> 00:21:45,840
Tomorrow, then.

394
00:21:48,712 --> 00:21:50,045
Your name's cool. I like it.

395
00:21:50,129 --> 00:21:51,170
Yeah? Thanks.

396
00:21:51,254 --> 00:21:53,847
So, whose Regalia are you, anyway?

397
00:21:54,254 --> 00:21:56,384
His name's Yato. He wears a tracksuit.

398
00:21:56,526 --> 00:21:58,342
Yato, huh? Never heard of him.

399
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,743
He's such a minor god, he might as well not exist.

400
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:02,879
And you?

401
00:22:02,962 --> 00:22:03,373
Me?

402
00:22:03,582 --> 00:22:06,629
Not bragging or anything, but my god is totally major.

403
00:22:06,806 --> 00:22:07,406
Yeah?

404
00:22:07,488 --> 00:22:09,681
I serve one of the Seven Gods of Fortune.

405
00:22:10,187 --> 00:22:12,167
I'm Lady Bishamon's Regalia!

406
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:12,997
Ah...

407
00:22:14,962 --> 00:22:16,879
Wow. Seriously?

408
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:17,974
Seriously!

409
00:23:55,421 --> 00:23:57,504
Ya-ho! It's me, Yato!

410
00:23:57,587 --> 00:24:00,712
A soon-to-be major god and a snappy high school senior!

411
00:24:00,782 --> 00:24:02,295
You? In high school?

412
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:04,302
The tracksuit won't be weird if I'm a student.

413
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,420
On the next Noragami Aragoto:

414
00:24:06,504 --> 00:24:07,629
"One of Her Memories."

415
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,873
That's not the only weird thing about you, y'know.
