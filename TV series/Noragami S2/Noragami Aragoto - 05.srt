1
00:00:02,095 --> 00:00:04,262
Ready. Go!

2
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:07,486
Ready... Go!

3
00:00:10,345 --> 00:00:12,095
No use. It won't work.

4
00:00:15,887 --> 00:00:17,298
Easy. Are you okay?

5
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:20,925
Yeah. I'm just a little tired.

6
00:00:24,262 --> 00:00:26,131
Her Cord is starting to fade.

7
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:29,386
Being here in her ethereal form is dangerous.

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,839
If we don't lift the Scourge
soon, her physical body will die.

9
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:36,893
This is my fault.

10
00:00:37,218 --> 00:00:39,492
I played right into Kugaha's hands.

11
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:43,084
Before long, he'll have won.

12
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:45,172
Please, Veena.

13
00:02:20,512 --> 00:02:23,053
Tch! Nice try! Sekki!

14
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:24,819
Now!

15
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:27,857
Confine!

16
00:02:31,054 --> 00:02:32,339
You're finished.

17
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:34,616
Come, Saiki!

18
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,141
No.

19
00:02:54,595 --> 00:02:56,621
Yukine!

20
00:03:04,304 --> 00:03:07,394
Hard to believe he sacrificed himself to protect you.

21
00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:12,921
Maybe now you understand the agony of losing a Regalia.

22
00:03:14,804 --> 00:03:17,007
I'll put you out of your misery.

23
00:03:17,494 --> 00:03:19,492
Yukine! Yukine!

24
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:24,783
His name. It's still there!

25
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:27,998
Sekki!

26
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:44,054
That light. What is this?

27
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,130
Impossible...

28
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,351
This is what happened with Kazuma.

29
00:03:57,595 --> 00:04:00,616
He wasn't much as a new Regalia. Just a small nail.

30
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:06,643
But rarely, very rarely, a Regalia will transform.

31
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:13,930
It happens only with the most sincere
and loyal of them. The Blessed Vessels!

32
00:04:15,677 --> 00:04:18,815
Wow. That was pretty amazing. Are you okay?

33
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:21,857
I'm not sure how, but I think I am.

34
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,175
Everything happened so fast. I guess I got carried away.

35
00:04:25,804 --> 00:04:28,515
Before I knew it, I'd turned into two blades.

36
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:30,360
Thank you, Yukine.

37
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,398
Huh?

38
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,777
As long as I've lived, you're
the first Regalia to change for me.

39
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:38,845
I'm so gonna brag to everybody about this.

40
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:41,262
Brag? You mean, about me?

41
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:46,721
A god of calamity with a Blessed Vessel?

42
00:04:54,102 --> 00:04:55,612
Her sword didn't break me!

43
00:04:55,944 --> 00:04:58,054
Yeah! You're awesome, kid!

44
00:05:00,054 --> 00:05:02,387
What do you say? You ready to get Hiyori back?

45
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,521
Let's do it!

46
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:10,920
My lady!

47
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,572
Heh. I didn't expect that brat to
evolve at the last second. This is perfect.

48
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,070
Stop! You let go of me!

49
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:21,060
That medicine should be wearing off.

50
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:46,429
What's happened to her? Don't tell me

51
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,798
I can't believe it. Our lady's been corrupted!

52
00:05:50,304 --> 00:05:53,244
No, this can't be happening!

53
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,178
Tch! Not again!

54
00:05:58,845 --> 00:06:01,304
I don't think so! You're staying right where you are.

55
00:06:01,387 --> 00:06:02,673
No, stay back!

56
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:04,765
I don't want you blighted, too!

57
00:06:05,595 --> 00:06:07,762
Are you really surprised you've been tainted?

58
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:11,278
You did arm a Regalia. And kidnap an innocent!

59
00:06:11,732 --> 00:06:13,762
Let's end this! Give Hiyori back now!

60
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:16,054
We would never do the things you're suggesting!

61
00:06:16,137 --> 00:06:18,137
Then how do you explain the blight?

62
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:23,470
She got like this because one of you tainted her.

63
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:24,265
Badly.

64
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,615
Yes. He's right. But who is it?

65
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:31,083
Time for another round of the blame game.

66
00:06:32,054 --> 00:06:33,975
I think you know how it's played.

67
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,053
Kinki!

68
00:06:41,887 --> 00:06:43,872
Milady, I'll take you away from here!

69
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:46,878
Attack him.

70
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:47,778
Huh?

71
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,054
If we want to save everyone, we have to kill Yato!

72
00:06:54,137 --> 00:06:55,762
That's one crazy chick.

73
00:06:57,888 --> 00:07:00,012
Have you seen the shape Bishamon's in?

74
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,363
It's only a matter of time
now until Yato finishes her off.

75
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:08,292
And while he's at it, maybe he can get
rid of her whole entourage for me, too.

76
00:07:08,821 --> 00:07:10,804
What an idiot Kazuma is.

77
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:13,068
Honestly, he's as blind as they get.

78
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,320
He couldn't see that something had to be done.

79
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:18,894
Fortunately, I was willing to step in.

80
00:07:19,595 --> 00:07:25,264
Soon, Bishamon will be reincarnated,
and then I'll be the exemplar.

81
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:28,679
Why? Why would you do this to her?

82
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:30,011
It's simple.

83
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:33,304
Our master's a failure.

84
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:34,684
Her time is up.

85
00:07:37,272 --> 00:07:41,478
Like an idiot, she insists on
helping every pathetic spirit.

86
00:07:41,597 --> 00:07:44,887
And then pats herself on the
back for being so kind and motherly.

87
00:07:45,762 --> 00:07:46,310
My Lady!

88
00:07:46,429 --> 00:07:52,012
She's ended up with a pile of junk Regalia,
all pretending to be one big, happy family.

89
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:53,929
That's the mighty Bishamon?

90
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,656
She's not my master, I'll tell you that.

91
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,429
Now, stop crying.

92
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:04,873
There's no need for you to suffer on
behalf of a wretch like her. I told you.

93
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:07,755
Be patient until after the reincarnation.

94
00:08:09,887 --> 00:08:12,722
The next Bishamon won't scorn you like this one has.

95
00:08:13,804 --> 00:08:17,645
And as the new exemplar, I'll have
the power to absolve you of guilt.

96
00:08:33,795 --> 00:08:35,544
Hey! No! Wait!

97
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,917
I'm not gonna let you hurt Yato!

98
00:08:42,095 --> 00:08:43,206
That's my boy!

99
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:53,429
Milady! Your blight is worsening!

100
00:08:53,512 --> 00:08:55,270
I'm begging you, please stop!

101
00:08:58,262 --> 00:08:59,262
Where is Kazuma?

102
00:08:59,345 --> 00:09:01,512
He's the one we really need right now.

103
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:07,054
Aki! Okinu! Take everyone inside.

104
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:09,137
We can't lose ourselves in this chaos.

105
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:12,212
Have anyone who can do so draw a borderline.

106
00:09:12,425 --> 00:09:13,179
Right! Yes, sir!

107
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:15,252
Come on, everybody! This way!

108
00:09:16,012 --> 00:09:17,804
There has to be something else I can do.

109
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:20,406
How do I make sure we all live through this?

110
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,387
Someone help.

111
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,535
I'm burning up.

112
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,831
Please. Please, my lady!

113
00:09:34,262 --> 00:09:37,321
We can't endure this pain. Just release us.

114
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,512
Please do it. Release me!

115
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,990
Even corrupted, you can still fight?

116
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:51,726
You may be crazy, but you're damn tough.

117
00:09:53,014 --> 00:09:54,220
Come, Jinki!

118
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,101
Okinu!

119
00:10:13,637 --> 00:10:15,429
You're beyond saving now.

120
00:10:15,512 --> 00:10:16,666
Run!

121
00:10:17,637 --> 00:10:19,660
Everyone into the hall! Hurry!

122
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:25,639
Oh, it's you, Doctor!

123
00:10:26,565 --> 00:10:28,749
Don't look like that. It's your lucky day.

124
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,095
You second-string Regalia are finally going to be useful.

125
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:35,924
Doctor. Why?

126
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,614
Now we're almost there.

127
00:10:56,544 --> 00:10:57,387
Damn it!

128
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:15,779
Aiha?

129
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,968
Please. Please forgive me.

130
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:23,806
I'm... I'm so sorry.

131
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:31,303
I'm the one who tainted our master!

132
00:11:32,512 --> 00:11:34,987
You have to stop Dr. Kuga!

133
00:11:36,138 --> 00:11:38,704
If you don't, everyone's going to die.

134
00:11:39,387 --> 00:11:40,963
What? Everybody?

135
00:11:41,554 --> 00:11:42,354
Kazuma!

136
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,981
What she says is true. Our master has been corrupted!

137
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,171
No one knows what to do.

138
00:11:49,262 --> 00:11:51,520
All hell broke loose after Yato showed up.

139
00:11:51,865 --> 00:11:54,659
If we don't act quickly, I don't know what could happen.

140
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,133
I'm coming, Veena. Aiha, we'll talk later.

141
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:00,470
All right, let's go.

142
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:01,554
Please, get on.

143
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,961
Me, too! You said Yato's here.

144
00:12:05,702 --> 00:12:08,012
You need to return to your body at once!

145
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:10,889
The Scourge is gone, but you're
still in critical condition.

146
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:15,054
Please, Kazuma. Do this for me. Take me with you!

147
00:12:15,226 --> 00:12:19,212
No! You're being foolish. I will not let you die this way!

148
00:12:19,304 --> 00:12:20,804
Now, return immediately!

149
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:22,878
No! You have to take me!

150
00:12:24,262 --> 00:12:26,064
I'm the one who can stop Yato.

151
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:33,595
I knew it. He's doing this to force a reincarnation.

152
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,863
So it would seem.

153
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:40,216
Apparently, he used some sort of medicine to
conceal the blight until the opportune moment.

154
00:12:41,123 --> 00:12:44,466
I apologize. You were right to be suspicious.

155
00:12:44,887 --> 00:12:46,304
What a fool I was.

156
00:12:46,387 --> 00:12:49,189
I blindly trusted him because he was our master's curer.

157
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:52,385
I was an idiot not to see through his ruse.

158
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:55,587
Choosing trust is usually the best course.

159
00:12:55,971 --> 00:12:58,715
We Regalia cannot afford to mistrust one another.

160
00:12:59,137 --> 00:13:01,637
Such discord is toxic to our master.

161
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,076
In extreme cases, it can even be fatal.

162
00:13:05,245 --> 00:13:07,487
No matter what, we must continue to smile.

163
00:13:07,794 --> 00:13:09,012
For our Lady's sake.

164
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:11,929
That's what I've always taught our family.

165
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:15,222
Always. But now we have disgraced her.

166
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:16,944
Once again.

167
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:20,512
Umm. Are you sure that really helps?

168
00:13:20,595 --> 00:13:22,142
Seems like it must be tough.

169
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,786
It sounds like Bishamon handles
things a lot differently than Yato.

170
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,762
He has no trouble complaining whenever he's in pain.

171
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:34,327
And Yukine's not usually shy
about sharing his feelings, either.

172
00:13:34,762 --> 00:13:38,619
That can lead to a whole lot of
bickering, but I like that about them.

173
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,071
It's sweet. You can tell they're
actually close to each other.

174
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,303
More family than friends.

175
00:13:46,345 --> 00:13:50,845
But Bishamon and her Regalia are
quietly suffering to keep up appearances.

176
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:53,155
Isn't that sort of hard on everyone?

177
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,262
A Phantom!

178
00:13:58,345 --> 00:13:59,856
What's it doing here?

179
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:04,554
Masked Ones are a far cry from ordinary Phantoms.

180
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:07,434
Your Borderlines won't last a second against one.

181
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:13,679
A hearty appetite!

182
00:14:13,762 --> 00:14:18,368
I wonder how much agony Bishamon
is in after losing so many Regalia.

183
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,142
More to go! So many more!

184
00:14:22,554 --> 00:14:25,179
Find the rest of the survivors, my Phantom friend.

185
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:27,369
Hunt them down and kill them all!

186
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:31,734
It's headed this way.

187
00:14:32,345 --> 00:14:33,673
We should get out of here.

188
00:14:34,262 --> 00:14:37,461
What are you waiting for? We need to go now!

189
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,595
Why bother?

190
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,341
Huh?

191
00:14:42,095 --> 00:14:44,027
More names have disappeared.

192
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:46,451
My Regalia are dying.

193
00:14:50,137 --> 00:14:53,412
This can't be happening. Not again.

194
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:56,429
My lady! Help!

195
00:14:56,512 --> 00:14:58,029
Please, my lady!

196
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:00,379
They're dying again!

197
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:07,980
He's taking them from me again.

198
00:15:09,804 --> 00:15:12,758
Damn you!

199
00:15:19,776 --> 00:15:22,842
She's using her Regalia even after being corrupted?

200
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:25,929
What the hell is she thinking?

201
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:27,887
You're better off just cutting it down.

202
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:30,503
Yato?

203
00:15:31,345 --> 00:15:34,769
Once a bond has come unraveled, there's no mending it.

204
00:15:37,256 --> 00:15:40,679
Careful not to become entangled,
or it will choke you as a Scourge.

205
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:41,825
Yato, look out!

206
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,457
You're better off just cutting it down.

207
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,671
Yato!

208
00:15:55,217 --> 00:15:57,779
Hey. I know that voice.

209
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:02,577
Yato! Stop fighting her!

210
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:06,389
Veena! It's worse than I thought.

211
00:16:07,388 --> 00:16:11,887
It's really her. Hiyori's
okay! Look, Yato, do you see her?

212
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,034
Hiyori's here! She's fine!

213
00:16:15,762 --> 00:16:17,486
Bishamon's not who you want!

214
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,142
You were tricked. She's not the one who kidnapped me!

215
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:21,951
It was our curer.

216
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,121
Kugaha wanted you to kill Veena.

217
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,508
If you did, she would reincarnate. That's what he's after.

218
00:16:28,262 --> 00:16:30,554
So you can stop fighting now, okay?

219
00:16:30,637 --> 00:16:33,245
I'm sorry, Veena! I should have realized it sooner.

220
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:37,762
Veena!

221
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:41,131
Sorry, Hiyori. The fight's not over.

222
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:48,294
Give them back. Give me my children back!

223
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:51,342
So I'm still the bad guy here, is that it?

224
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:54,579
I get it. That's what kept you going all this time.

225
00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:56,871
That unjustified hatred.

226
00:16:57,637 --> 00:16:59,220
Whatever. That's fine.

227
00:16:59,304 --> 00:17:01,233
I'm just a filthy Nora-keeper.

228
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:04,262
So let me do what I do best.

229
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:07,680
Your Regalia clearly need killing. I'll do the honors.

230
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,049
Yato!

231
00:17:14,674 --> 00:17:17,167
What do we do? We can't just stand here.

232
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:19,311
Kazuma!

233
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:24,784
Now, then.

234
00:17:25,387 --> 00:17:27,911
If you'll excuse me, I have another appointment.

235
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:30,778
Your dear master is about to die.

236
00:17:31,095 --> 00:17:33,844
And that is something I would like to see.

237
00:17:39,554 --> 00:17:40,545
Milady!

238
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:46,387
Yato!

239
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,765
No, stay back!

240
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:52,720
Pretty soon, she's gonna take us down with her.

241
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:54,095
We have to kill her.

242
00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:56,346
Don't worry.

243
00:17:57,262 --> 00:18:00,777
She'll be reborn, and you won't really
be the one doing the killing, anyway.

244
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,229
This one's all on me.

245
00:18:05,856 --> 00:18:08,974
It's okay, kid. Killing a god's no big deal.

246
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,321
Veena. Listen to me.

247
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:06,920
There's something... I've never told you.

248
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:10,506
The Ma Clan's death wasn't Yato's fault.

249
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:12,819
It was mine.

250
00:19:14,512 --> 00:19:16,038
I asked him to do it.

251
00:19:18,804 --> 00:19:22,428
I betrayed them. They died and I survived.

252
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:25,355
I wanted so badly to tell you the truth.

253
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:30,343
I can't protect you, master.

254
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,679
I'm just a little nail.

255
00:19:32,762 --> 00:19:36,121
Please, you must find other Regalia to serve you.

256
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:38,263
Better ones.

257
00:19:38,356 --> 00:19:40,539
No. I never wanna go through that again.

258
00:19:41,317 --> 00:19:43,152
I don't need any other Regalia!

259
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,626
All I need is you!

260
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:50,710
In the end, I wasn't able to say it.

261
00:19:52,637 --> 00:19:55,022
Nor could I stop you from hating Yato.

262
00:19:57,512 --> 00:19:59,106
You needed that hatred.

263
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:01,534
It's what gave you new strength.

264
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:06,260
So you see, I'm a coward!

265
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,731
I only wanted to be with you.

266
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:16,147
Your words that day were bitter, but
they filled me with joy. I reveled in it.

267
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:20,162
And now, I've made you weep yet again.

268
00:20:20,675 --> 00:20:24,336
Blessed Vessel? That isn't a title I deserve.

269
00:20:24,872 --> 00:20:26,717
I've failed you in every way.

270
00:20:28,418 --> 00:20:29,822
Just look at us now.

271
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:32,430
This is where my guidance has led us.

272
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:37,147
I've put you through such anguish.

273
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:40,454
I don't deserve your forgiveness, but I am sorry.

274
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,383
Oh, Milady.

275
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,389
So much pain.

276
00:21:32,012 --> 00:21:39,110
She must have been holding this in for
years, for centuries. She's sobbing like a child.

277
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,338
It's done, Bishamon. Time to end this.

278
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,442
You have to let your Regalia go.

279
00:21:50,688 --> 00:21:51,411
Yugi.

280
00:21:53,304 --> 00:22:01,368
Kinu. Tsugu. Kazu. Karu. Kura.

281
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,524
Kazuma. I'm sorry. So sorry.

282
00:22:09,554 --> 00:22:11,137
It's happened again.

283
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,720
How many members of my family are dead?

284
00:22:13,804 --> 00:22:16,012
I don't know if I can bear this!

285
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:17,128
I don't get it.

286
00:22:17,324 --> 00:22:19,387
Yato hasn't killed anybody tonight.

287
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,083
So who did kill them?

288
00:22:22,595 --> 00:22:24,762
The mastermind of this little scheme.

289
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,929
I can't believe you're a Blessed Vessel
now! Let's have a party to celebrate.

290
00:23:59,012 --> 00:24:02,220
We'll dress all in white, buy a huge
cake, and throw rice at each other!

291
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:05,002
Uh, no. You're thinking of a wedding!

292
00:24:05,137 --> 00:24:06,679
On the next Noragami Aragoto:

293
00:24:06,762 --> 00:24:07,887
"What Must be Done."

294
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,762
I'm not marrying you, dude!
