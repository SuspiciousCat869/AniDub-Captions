1
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:33,676
It's happened again.

2
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:36,945
How many members of my family are dead?

3
00:01:37,334 --> 00:01:39,293
I don't know if I can bear this!

4
00:01:39,376 --> 00:01:42,709
I don't get it. Yato hasn't killed anybody tonight.

5
00:01:42,793 --> 00:01:44,188
So who did kill them?

6
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:47,797
The mastermind of this little scheme.

7
00:01:48,293 --> 00:01:48,823
Huh?

8
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:52,534
A Regalia who conspired against his own master.

9
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,430
We know you're there. No reason
to keep lurking in the shadows.

10
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:06,192
Aww, poor things!

11
00:02:06,512 --> 00:02:08,467
They're barely clinging to life.

12
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:10,369
You should put them out of their misery.

13
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:13,347
Eh? Go on, Lord Yato.

14
00:02:14,418 --> 00:02:17,038
Doctor... Kuga...?

15
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:20,293
Kuga, huh? So that's your name.

16
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:21,984
Thought I'd be seeing you again.

17
00:02:22,418 --> 00:02:24,695
Quite an elaborate plan you cooked up.

18
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:27,601
This would've happened eventually, one way or the other.

19
00:02:27,874 --> 00:02:31,565
Bishamon hounding you all the
time has to have gotten old by now.

20
00:02:32,376 --> 00:02:34,495
Here's your chance to be free of her.

21
00:02:35,214 --> 00:02:37,751
I don't understand why you would hesitate.

22
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:40,501
Haven't you already massacred a clan of Regalia?

23
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:41,784
What's one more?

24
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:44,710
It was you? Why?

25
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:47,334
You're still a little out of it, aren't you?

26
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:49,479
Maybe I should explain what's happening.

27
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:55,219
The fact of the matter is you caused this. You.

28
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:58,878
By needlessly granting names to Regalia after Regalia.

29
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:02,338
You're a failure as both master and god.

30
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:06,698
Knowing that, do you truly
believe you can continue as you are?

31
00:03:08,092 --> 00:03:13,751
The name Bishamon is supposed to belong to
the noblest, fiercest, and mightiest god of war.

32
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:19,038
A model of godhood who uses only the
finest Regalia to expel evil from the world.

33
00:03:19,814 --> 00:03:21,670
But instead, we have you.

34
00:03:21,841 --> 00:03:27,027
A god who strokes her own ego by
granting names to worthless, broken souls,

35
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:30,662
and is then forced to drug herself
so that she can endure their pain.

36
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:35,788
A god obsessed with a personal grudge,
dragged her Regalia into it, and then shamefully,

37
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:37,959
disgracefully, was corrupted.

38
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:43,246
Takamagahara has been desecrated by
your defilement. You've become detestable.

39
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:44,484
Evil.

40
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:47,168
Look at what you've done tonight.

41
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:49,440
You destroyed your own Blessed Vessel.

42
00:03:49,675 --> 00:03:52,338
No one will ever willingly follow you again.

43
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:58,889
I can see your tears, but tell me
this, Lady Bishamon: For whom do you weep?

44
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,123
Do you weep for yourself?

45
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:03,803
If so, you're utterly despicable.

46
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:08,927
However, if it is for the sake of
your Regalia that you shed those tears,

47
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:11,527
then I don't need to tell you what must be done.

48
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:13,311
You already know.

49
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:17,989
You filthy, traitorous snake.

50
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:21,293
You're actually asking our master to die?

51
00:04:21,376 --> 00:04:22,749
To end her own life?

52
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,099
Of course I am.

53
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,946
I'm hurt that you would call me a traitor, though.

54
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:32,243
Through it all, I have only ever
had Bishamon's best interest in mind.

55
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,435
Our master deserves the chance to be born anew.

56
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,549
And the proper guidance that I will provide.

57
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:49,504
Yeah?

58
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,439
You know what I think you're really saying?

59
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,777
"Look at me. Pay more attention to me, Mommy!"

60
00:04:58,084 --> 00:04:59,388
That's what I'm hearing.

61
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:00,409
What?

62
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:03,975
If you want your master's approval, then do your job well.

63
00:05:04,197 --> 00:05:07,655
If you wanna oppose your master,
then take it up with your exemplar.

64
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:12,582
People distinguish between right and
wrong, but those concepts don't apply to gods.

65
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:14,391
And do you know why that is?

66
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:17,882
Because every action that a god takes is the right one.

67
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:23,700
You know what it's like, you forcing her reincarnation?

68
00:05:23,793 --> 00:05:26,738
It's like a spoiled kid trying to kill his parents.

69
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:30,025
You are something less than human.

70
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,495
You'll pay for what you've done, Kugaha.

71
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:34,573
I promise that.

72
00:05:35,374 --> 00:05:37,491
Come forth, Goki!

73
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,693
A mask? What is this?

74
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:02,924
I brought you here to help me.

75
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:06,439
If you're not going to kill her, then I will kill you.

76
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:08,668
I'll end your very existence.

77
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,081
We should get out of here.

78
00:06:13,254 --> 00:06:14,768
What are you waiting for?

79
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:18,376
If we can get to the master's
purifying spring, I think we'll be safe.

80
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,939
Why bother?

81
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:22,418
You saw what happened.

82
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:26,779
All my friends are dead. Our master's gonna die, too.

83
00:06:27,314 --> 00:06:30,543
I don't wanna live anymore, either. What's the point?

84
00:06:30,626 --> 00:06:32,369
What do you mean, "What's the point?"

85
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:36,468
Our master saved us. We owe
it to her to survive if we can.

86
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:40,269
She gave us names. She carried our pain.

87
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:42,928
She made this place a home for us.

88
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:46,362
It won't ever feel like home here again.

89
00:06:48,395 --> 00:06:51,565
You're saying that because you
can't see past your grief right now.

90
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:54,088
You're sad because so many people are dead.

91
00:06:54,632 --> 00:06:56,334
I know. I feel the same.

92
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:59,194
But us dying too won't help, Fumiha.

93
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:04,884
That's the name our master gave you, isn't it?

94
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:07,833
Let's go, Fumiha. Let's try.

95
00:07:12,374 --> 00:07:15,707
Let's go, Fumiha. Let's try.

96
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:19,793
Let's go. Let's go, Fumiha.

97
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:20,959
Let's die.

98
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:23,531
Die.

99
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:25,376
Now or never! Are you with me?

100
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:26,251
Yeah!

101
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:27,918
Die!

102
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,487
Get back, Hiyori.

103
00:07:36,713 --> 00:07:39,709
You didn't get what you want, so
now you're throwin' a tantrum, huh?

104
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,358
Shut up!

105
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,876
You wouldn't understand my reasons.

106
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,584
Not a nobody like you, Yato god!

107
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:56,582
Are you okay?

108
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:02,258
Ha, ha! Look at you, bested by a measly Phantom.

109
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:05,692
You are a poor, pitiful excuse for a god.

110
00:08:06,214 --> 00:08:09,209
Blinded to your duty by your devotion to people.

111
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:10,501
You're a useless fool!

112
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:12,489
Just who the hell do you think you are?

113
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:19,084
It's over!

114
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:22,932
I thought you would be a useful
tool, but obviously, I was wrong.

115
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:26,459
You're finished now, lowly god of calamity!

116
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:38,992
A lowly god, am I? Right.

117
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:41,914
You know, I used to hear that all the time.

118
00:08:42,871 --> 00:08:44,293
Yukine, now!

119
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:45,088
I'm ready!

120
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,001
O' masked one who seeks to scourge.

121
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:54,724
Your desecrations shall not be allowed!

122
00:08:54,918 --> 00:08:57,793
Hear me. I am the god, Yato.

123
00:08:57,876 --> 00:08:59,918
I now lay thee waste with the Sekki,

124
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:04,063
and expel thy vast defilement. I cleanse thee!

125
00:09:06,736 --> 00:09:07,715
Rend!

126
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:22,498
Yes, you were very wrong about me.

127
00:09:23,418 --> 00:09:26,037
I'm nobody's puppet. Certainly not yours.

128
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:35,246
What are you doing, Bishamon?

129
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:42,304
I won't let you touch him, Yato.

130
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:45,891
He is family. Just as all my Regalia are.

131
00:09:48,168 --> 00:09:49,296
You're serious.

132
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:51,243
Tell me, Kugaha.

133
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:55,083
Do you remember the day I named you?

134
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,990
I do. Quite well.

135
00:09:59,501 --> 00:10:01,234
It was cold. Snowing.

136
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:04,923
I found you along the wharf. You had nowhere to go.

137
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:08,933
You soon proved your skill at concocting remedies.

138
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,725
And you were happy to share your knowledge with others.

139
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:14,491
You became a close adviser to Kazuma.

140
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:19,376
And in your capacity as our curer,
you competently looked after my health.

141
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:25,065
Your ministrations often helped me to forget my pain.

142
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:28,334
But that was wrong of me.

143
00:10:28,418 --> 00:10:29,982
I shouldn't have forgotten it.

144
00:10:30,626 --> 00:10:32,524
The root of my pain was your own.

145
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,781
How could I lose sight of that?

146
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:37,488
I am truly sorry.

147
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:40,007
What? I don't want your apology!

148
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:42,657
This is disgraceful! Bishamon.

149
00:10:43,084 --> 00:10:45,402
I swear on your name.

150
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:47,918
I've never once tainted you. Not ever!

151
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:50,547
He's really trying to play innocent, after all he's done?

152
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,348
Except he isn't lying. She
would have been stung if he was.

153
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:57,549
You seem to be telling the truth.

154
00:10:57,743 --> 00:11:02,583
You truly believed that, by forcing me to
reincarnate, you would be doing the just thing.

155
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:07,211
In which case, you've acted righteously.

156
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,735
Yes! Exactly!

157
00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:12,743
I've done nothing wrong! My actions were just!

158
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:18,001
Lady Bishamon! Please, we need you inside!

159
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:20,310
A masked Phantom is attacking everybody!

160
00:11:22,126 --> 00:11:23,686
You know who brought it here.

161
00:11:24,213 --> 00:11:30,017
Him. "Just actions?" He called a freakin'
Phantom here and you're gonna let him live?

162
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:32,171
Truly?

163
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:38,803
I feel an ache in my heart.

164
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:41,376
Is this your pain, Kugaha?

165
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:43,048
Enough. Out of my way!

166
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:45,865
What you asked before.

167
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:49,300
If I could really continue on like this.

168
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,447
To be honest, I'm not sure.

169
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:57,411
But for now at least, I will do what must be done. Rokki!

170
00:12:00,743 --> 00:12:03,716
I'd forgotten. You're a balance scale.

171
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:04,943
Please don't!

172
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,709
I apologize for putting you to so little use.

173
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,916
Wait! No! Don't do this!

174
00:12:10,418 --> 00:12:13,959
It was for you! Everything I have done has been for you!

175
00:12:14,043 --> 00:12:16,668
It's over now. Rokki! I release you!

176
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:20,793
Stop! No!

177
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,684
Lady Bishamon!

178
00:12:33,334 --> 00:12:35,418
After all that, you let him go.

179
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:36,833
It was my decision.

180
00:12:37,543 --> 00:12:39,149
Now go. Do as you wish.

181
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:42,293
Akiha. Look after the others.

182
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:43,169
I will.

183
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,043
You're just gonna run away?

184
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:50,008
I am not.

185
00:12:57,836 --> 00:13:00,014
Please, Yato. Let's leave.

186
00:13:00,584 --> 00:13:03,126
Not yet. There's still a Masked One here to deal with.

187
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:04,190
Let her go.

188
00:13:04,793 --> 00:13:06,722
She needs to do it herself.

189
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,668
Hiyori! Are you okay?

190
00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:19,539
Yeah.

191
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:23,228
Damn, Kazuma. He must've told Hiyori.

192
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:26,746
Hey! Bishamon!

193
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:29,796
You shouldn't feel bad about this, okay? Not at all.

194
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:31,543
Listen to me.

195
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:33,483
No matter what anyone might say,

196
00:13:34,126 --> 00:13:35,954
what you're going in there to do

197
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:37,761
is right!

198
00:13:40,783 --> 00:13:42,709
Everyone stay calm.

199
00:13:42,793 --> 00:13:45,084
The monster shouldn't be able to reach us here.

200
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:53,134
Die.

201
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:58,270
Die. Die. Die. Die. Die.

202
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,221
You see, it's all right. We'll be safe here.

203
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:10,834
Impossible!

204
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:13,459
It shouldn't be able to walk
through the water in this spring.

205
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:16,085
Come, Ruki!

206
00:14:22,543 --> 00:14:23,863
I hoped you'd come!

207
00:14:24,336 --> 00:14:25,632
I'm sorry I'm late.

208
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:28,420
I hate to ask this of you.

209
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,740
I know it isn't a pleasant task.

210
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:31,887
Please!

211
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:36,737
If a rusted swordstick like me can be of
use, I'm happy to help any way I can, my lady.

212
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,528
Those who the monster has eaten are gone forever.

213
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,709
I would never forgive myself if I let
these youngsters suffer the same fate as them.

214
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:46,539
Thank you.

215
00:14:47,007 --> 00:14:48,668
Help, my lady!

216
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:49,861
It hurts!

217
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:51,293
My lady!

218
00:14:51,376 --> 00:14:53,045
Please help us!

219
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:54,918
I hurt with you.

220
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:57,415
The root of my pain is your own.

221
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,168
I make you this promise:

222
00:15:05,148 --> 00:15:07,918
I will end your suffering!

223
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:15,095
My comrades. I'm sorry.

224
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,251
Once again, I've lost my way.

225
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:21,816
My mistake has hurt you all.

226
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:24,154
I failed as your exemplar.

227
00:15:25,043 --> 00:15:28,605
I failed to protect her, just like before.

228
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:30,168
Who was it?

229
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:31,209
Who tainted her?

230
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:32,626
For all we know, it was you!

231
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:34,001
Excuse me?

232
00:15:57,182 --> 00:16:01,972
Go, Kazuma. Stay away. It will spread.

233
00:16:03,793 --> 00:16:07,336
This is our fault. We've betrayed you, Master.

234
00:16:08,687 --> 00:16:10,002
What can we do?

235
00:16:11,251 --> 00:16:13,061
How can we ever atone for this?

236
00:16:14,688 --> 00:16:15,894
Promise me.

237
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:19,157
If this is the end for me...

238
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:22,925
If I die, will you be my Regalia again when I am reborn?

239
00:16:31,084 --> 00:16:32,418
I won't let you die.

240
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,866
I will protect you. No matter what it takes!

241
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:39,937
No matter what I must become.

242
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,192
Whatever happens, I will keep you safe.

243
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,174
I swear it! I swear it!

244
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,747
It is we who make mistakes.

245
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:10,656
That is a human failing.

246
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:17,586
Veena. Whatever you do, it is always right.

247
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,885
Please... my... lady!

248
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:35,797
I'm sorry.

249
00:17:38,716 --> 00:17:42,349
I'm sorry, but I will do what must be done!

250
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:45,955
Now, it's over!

251
00:18:05,893 --> 00:18:07,581
Goodbye, my children.

252
00:18:09,918 --> 00:18:11,567
I'm so sorry.

253
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:23,208
You're awake.

254
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:27,498
How long has it been?

255
00:18:27,964 --> 00:18:30,812
It seems like your health is greatly improved, Master.

256
00:18:32,168 --> 00:18:36,770
You haven't called me "Master" in a long
time. Were you dreaming of the old days?

257
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:44,485
You're right, though. I am feeling better.

258
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:50,822
Aiha successfully underwent an
ablution to remove the blight.

259
00:18:52,209 --> 00:18:55,185
The other Regalia have labored untiringly.

260
00:18:56,113 --> 00:18:58,824
It is true that we've lost many of our kin.

261
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:02,877
But many are still alive, and they are thriving.

262
00:19:05,681 --> 00:19:06,920
They're working hard.

263
00:19:07,094 --> 00:19:09,325
Starting over from scratch together.

264
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:11,621
It makes me happy to see.

265
00:19:13,793 --> 00:19:14,600
Master.

266
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:15,689
Mm?

267
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:19,126
I must ask you to release me.

268
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:21,918
I've disgraced you twice now.

269
00:19:22,001 --> 00:19:23,971
I don't deserve to be your Regalia.

270
00:19:25,793 --> 00:19:28,315
Like the old woman said when I transformed.

271
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:32,148
I only end up hurting you.

272
00:19:34,584 --> 00:19:36,455
Yes, but I don't mind.

273
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:40,834
Any of you could hurt me, sooner or later.

274
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:42,457
It's part of being master.

275
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:46,294
You are all so kind.

276
00:19:47,043 --> 00:19:49,615
When you hurt me, you feel hurt in turn.

277
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:53,074
That's why I've always tried to hide my pain.

278
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,970
I worried that complaining about it would
only increase the guilt you already felt.

279
00:19:59,922 --> 00:20:04,451
I need to change that, but
honestly, I don't know where to start.

280
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,829
This is how I've always done things.

281
00:20:07,918 --> 00:20:11,461
I need you. Be my guide, Kazuma.

282
00:20:12,028 --> 00:20:14,264
I'll lose my way again. I know I will.

283
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:16,543
You're allowed to make mistakes.

284
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:17,990
Can't you accept that?

285
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,155
My lady...

286
00:20:22,316 --> 00:20:25,203
We brought it, my lady. Sorry it took so long.

287
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:29,283
Oh! Kazuma's awake! That's wonderful.

288
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:31,393
I should let everyone know.

289
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:35,084
He looks so different without his glasses, doesn't he?

290
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,168
Oh, yeah! Ten years younger at least.

291
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:39,001
What if he wore pink glasses?

292
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:40,293
I don't think so!

293
00:20:40,376 --> 00:20:44,407
Hey, we started an exchange diary that
we take turns writing notes in. Here, see?

294
00:20:44,751 --> 00:20:46,755
I think you should write something in it, too.

295
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,660
Eh-hem. Don't laugh, all right?

296
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:55,622
It's just an idea I had.

297
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:57,930
To get to know you all better.

298
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:06,834
Tsuguha! Why'd you write that?
What's wrong with my romance stories?

299
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:09,126
Like I said in the diary, they're obnoxious.

300
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:10,293
I just tell it like it is.

301
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:12,126
They're not obnoxious!

302
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:15,208
You know what's worse? The awful pun someone attempted.

303
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:17,834
That's not an appropriate response, Master.

304
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:19,482
What? Really? It isn't?

305
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:21,961
Huh?

306
00:21:24,273 --> 00:21:26,218
No, it most definitely is not.

307
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:34,273
There, you see? I'm simply lost without my guide.

308
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:39,574
Kazuma. I hereby lift your exile.

309
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,634
Come back. Say you'll be my exemplar again.

310
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:52,800
I will.

311
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,209
Kugaha turned out to be a failure.

312
00:23:34,293 --> 00:23:35,131
What a shame.

313
00:23:35,418 --> 00:23:37,168
All he could manage was a jingle.

314
00:23:37,256 --> 00:23:38,960
Never any real music.

315
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:48,386
I'm to bring Yato here?

316
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:54,239
Yes. I'll do that, Father.

317
00:23:55,876 --> 00:23:57,751
An exchange diary, huh?

318
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:59,334
I wonder what I should write.

319
00:23:59,418 --> 00:24:03,043
Let's see, "Dearest Veena"... No, I can't say that!

320
00:24:03,126 --> 00:24:05,044
On the next Noragami Aragoto:

321
00:24:05,293 --> 00:24:06,543
"How to Worship a God."

322
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:08,334
Tsuguha! How long've you been there?

323
00:24:08,418 --> 00:24:09,685
The whole time.
