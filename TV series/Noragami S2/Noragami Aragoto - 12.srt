1
00:00:01,698 --> 00:00:04,190
It was always odd how often he reincarnated,

2
00:00:04,215 --> 00:00:06,168
but this is simply shocking!

3
00:00:06,193 --> 00:00:09,097
To think that Ebisu is the
conjurer that they've been hunting.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,196
I hear that he controls some formidable Phantoms.

5
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:15,787
And did you know that most of
his Regalia were actually Noras?

6
00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:20,546
A God of Fortune, a Nora-keeping
conjurer? It's practically unthinkable!

7
00:00:20,665 --> 00:00:23,026
I wonder why he would ever do something like this.

8
00:00:23,138 --> 00:00:26,457
That is entirely irrelevant. Taboos are taboos.

9
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:31,296
The heavens' disorder begets humans'
disorder. Time is of the essence.

10
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:37,063
Ebisu has been revealed as a Phantom conjurer
and devotee. So, we set forth to slay him.

11
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,241
Quick! Now's your best chance!

12
00:02:23,556 --> 00:02:24,223
Aiha!

13
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:27,978
Oh, no!

14
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:35,874
Hey! You okay?

15
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:41,005
Stay very still, Veena. She'll take your head off.

16
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:42,680
So I assumed.

17
00:02:46,113 --> 00:02:49,074
Oh, look! This is pretty!

18
00:02:50,613 --> 00:02:53,143
Give him back! Right now!

19
00:02:53,168 --> 00:02:56,405
What excellent luck! It's nearly dinner time.

20
00:02:56,776 --> 00:03:00,137
Come, everyone. We'll have a feast tonight.

21
00:03:00,462 --> 00:03:04,324
Look at this scrumptious dish. Plenty for all, ladies!

22
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,762
Ooh, yes please!

23
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,639
That does look delicious!

24
00:03:08,703 --> 00:03:12,437
Come, come. Eat as much as you'd like.

25
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:17,108
What are you doing? Stop! Get away from me!

26
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:21,780
No! Veena!

27
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:22,437
Get off!

28
00:03:22,462 --> 00:03:23,141
Stop!

29
00:03:23,688 --> 00:03:26,236
Damn it! Can't get out!

30
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:29,013
Struggling against it will only hurt you more.

31
00:03:29,102 --> 00:03:32,849
I've had enough of this! Lemme go, you old hag!

32
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:39,774
Kunimi. Are you all right?

33
00:03:40,197 --> 00:03:44,298
I'll live, but just barely.
If it wasn't for the Yato god...

34
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:49,953
I hope he'll be okay. Lady Bishamon
just went into the underworld to save him.

35
00:03:51,257 --> 00:03:52,368
That's something.

36
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:56,079
Though I don't think even she is a match for Izanami.

37
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,630
But hold on. Didn't you just say
there was a way we could bring him back?

38
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:02,277
What were you talking about?

39
00:04:03,103 --> 00:04:07,186
It's a method known as a Soul Call. I don't understand.

40
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:12,942
You peer into the very depths of the underworld and
call out someone's name to fasten them to the Near Shore.

41
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:18,188
I believe that's the only way left
to bring him back from Izanami's realm.

42
00:04:18,827 --> 00:04:22,684
So we just gotta call his name?
You really think that will do it?

43
00:04:23,198 --> 00:04:28,193
If it doesn't, nothing will. But it must
come from a Near Shore being with ties to him.

44
00:04:28,898 --> 00:04:33,114
Gods and the deceased are
unable to do it. Only a human can.

45
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:33,964
You.

46
00:04:34,736 --> 00:04:38,511
To be honest, I've never heard of this
technique being used on a god before.

47
00:04:39,102 --> 00:04:42,008
But we've no other choice. It's worth a try.

48
00:04:45,144 --> 00:04:46,703
Good luck. Be careful.

49
00:04:52,686 --> 00:04:55,204
Yato!

50
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,366
Go on!

51
00:04:58,104 --> 00:05:05,549
Go on! You only have to take one little bite of the
food of the underworld. Then you can stay with me forever!

52
00:05:05,574 --> 00:05:09,943
Won't that be nice? Go on. Have some!

53
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,480
Hold on. Stay strong!

54
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:25,466
I'm going to try and rip her hair off.

55
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:31,719
Soon. Almost there.

56
00:05:32,503 --> 00:05:33,879
My lady!

57
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:57,718
Lady Izanami. I'm sorry to interrupt your banquet, but
it's time for us to leave. The Yato god's coming with me.

58
00:05:57,743 --> 00:05:59,078
Bishamonten!

59
00:06:03,832 --> 00:06:07,326
She disappeared. Wait, could that have been...?

60
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:09,885
A Soul Call.

61
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:15,572
It was a Soul Call? So... I can get
outta here if someone calls my name?

62
00:06:15,937 --> 00:06:17,430
Yes, it would seem so.

63
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,595
Yato! Yato!

64
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,247
Milady! Were you harmed in any way?

65
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:29,274
Wha... What just happened to me down there?

66
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:32,810
Yato! Yato!

67
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,045
Why? He's not coming.

68
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,095
Hey! Look out!

69
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:46,682
I don't get it! It worked on Lady Bishamon but
not him? What's wrong? Why can't we Soul Call Yato?

70
00:06:47,078 --> 00:06:48,636
That was a Soul Call?

71
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:53,767
Well, let's think. Is it
possible that's not his true name?

72
00:06:55,476 --> 00:07:00,043
So he borrowed one? Like in the same way
that my lady goes by Ebisu Kofuku you mean?

73
00:07:00,075 --> 00:07:01,641
That is a possibility.

74
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:05,512
I do it to obscure my identity as a god of poverty.

75
00:07:06,371 --> 00:07:08,674
So then, who is Yato?

76
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:13,573
Damn! Using an alternate name?
He's never talked about that!

77
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:18,638
That's why it didn't work. You must call
his true name to bring him back successfully.

78
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:20,891
Any idea what it could be?

79
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:22,234
No.

80
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:23,655
Kazuma?

81
00:07:24,049 --> 00:07:26,655
I can't think of anything. I'm very sorry.

82
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:31,610
If we don't do something swiftly,
Yato will be trapped forever.

83
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:40,658
What is that?

84
00:07:42,472 --> 00:07:43,670
No, it can't be.

85
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:53,275
The heavens' Punishers!

86
00:07:56,636 --> 00:08:01,641
All they have to do is call my name?
Great! Any minute, we'll be outta here!

87
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,501
Will we?

88
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:07,172
Do they know your real name? Did you ever tell them?

89
00:08:08,574 --> 00:08:11,569
Yato, my dear!

90
00:08:13,054 --> 00:08:15,533
Aren't you getting hungry yet?

91
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:20,002
She's right. I never told them anything.

92
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:22,647
I couldn't bring myself to.

93
00:08:24,977 --> 00:08:27,732
I knew if I told them, they'd hate me.

94
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:30,338
They'd abandon me for sure.

95
00:08:31,197 --> 00:08:35,439
So I stayed silent. I revealed nothing about my past.

96
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,627
And that means... They don't know my real name.

97
00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:44,178
They can't call me back. I'm trapped.

98
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:56,939
So it's all over. If the heavens have
chosen to reject me, then I'm finished.

99
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:02,040
Who are they? The heavens' Punishers?

100
00:09:02,143 --> 00:09:04,114
It looks like they're all gods.

101
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:06,713
The bastards are hiding their faces.

102
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:12,733
I guess they don't want anybody knowing the
identity of Lord Ebisu's killers. That's disgusting.

103
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:17,103
Ebisu! You've already returned from the underworld, I see.

104
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:18,325
A Vent!

105
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,779
You've opened a Vent into the
underworld? What exactly are you planning?

106
00:09:24,946 --> 00:09:27,264
Look! It's releasing Phantoms!

107
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:28,439
We must seal it!

108
00:09:28,464 --> 00:09:29,162
No!

109
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,236
We'll never get Yato out!

110
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,769
Wait, everyone!

111
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:37,385
I implore you to give Ebisu a
chance to explain what he has done.

112
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:42,257
Bishamonten. Why are you interfering with our task?

113
00:09:42,352 --> 00:09:46,379
Is it not natural for me to stand
in support of a fellow God of Fortune?

114
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:51,408
I had hoped we might hear Ebisu's reasons
before resorting to senseless murder.

115
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:57,795
We are standing in front of a Vent that
he opened. We have no need of explanations.

116
00:09:58,302 --> 00:10:01,528
Say what you will, but he has done no wrong!

117
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:03,301
Bishamon, wait.

118
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,662
I have complete faith in him.

119
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:16,077
The heavens' decree is not a matter for debate. If
you insist on protecting him, you do so at your own risk.

120
00:10:18,238 --> 00:10:23,278
Conjurer Ebisu! You have violated a
taboo and caused disorder in the heavens.

121
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,334
You are to be cleansed and kept in the Shrine of Passing!

122
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:36,869
Once, I would have given in. But... I
am no longer so accepting of my own death.

123
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,252
How can you be ready to give up so easily?

124
00:10:39,285 --> 00:10:42,556
Isn't there someone you'll miss? Or
maybe something you wanna do again?

125
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:46,649
I've finally realized that there are
some things I'm willing to fight for.

126
00:10:48,532 --> 00:10:53,584
My name will endure past my death. For that
reason, I have long taken my lives for granted.

127
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:57,356
But I'm not ready to give this one up yet.

128
00:11:03,285 --> 00:11:04,412
Fire!

129
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,863
Defend me, Senki!

130
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,959
Yes!

131
00:11:12,654 --> 00:11:15,595
There's the proof! He does employ Phantoms!

132
00:11:15,628 --> 00:11:18,926
You've shown yourself for what you are, conjurer!

133
00:11:25,573 --> 00:11:27,299
Come, Uki! Come, Tekki!

134
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:33,782
Quickly! Shuki! Sakki! Gaki!

135
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,004
Kinki!

136
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:50,594
The Vent!

137
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:51,755
Kofuku!

138
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:52,707
Kokki!

139
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:56,490
Let's give this one everything we've got!

140
00:11:57,388 --> 00:11:58,165
Yeah!

141
00:11:58,339 --> 00:11:59,464
Bore!

142
00:12:04,554 --> 00:12:09,811
It's no good. It's still closing! Please!
You need to call Yatty's real name and quickly!

143
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:11,872
She can't call it if we don't know it!

144
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:12,616
Yato!

145
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:13,405
Whoa, hey!

146
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:17,622
Yato! Please, you have to come back!

147
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:18,887
Borderline!

148
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:21,578
Come on! You'll get shot, Hiyori!

149
00:12:21,777 --> 00:12:27,609
Yato! Yato!

150
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:46,120
Yato! Yato! Yato!

151
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:48,133
That obviously isn't his name!

152
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:49,471
It has to be!

153
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:58,086
Remember? That shrine I made Yato... He was so happy
when he got it. He said it was what he always wanted.

154
00:12:58,173 --> 00:13:07,173
I carved his name on it. How could that name be the wrong
one? He was so happy, he cried. I did carve "Yato," right?

155
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,495
Yaboku!

156
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:32,006
That light! What's happening?

157
00:14:05,182 --> 00:14:07,556
You... called me.

158
00:14:09,257 --> 00:14:10,167
I did.

159
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,452
It really worked! You're here.

160
00:14:20,857 --> 00:14:24,377
I'm here. Thanks to you.

161
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:32,807
Alone again. Will no one ever stay with me?

162
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,811
He summoned something from the underworld!

163
00:14:39,836 --> 00:14:41,501
Dispatch it quickly!

164
00:14:46,617 --> 00:14:47,833
Are you okay?

165
00:14:48,462 --> 00:14:49,653
I think so.

166
00:14:50,744 --> 00:14:52,854
You came all this way to look for me?

167
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:06,046
Ebisu! You're in bad shape. You and the others fall
back. You don't stand a chance against the Punishers.

168
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,360
I can still fight.

169
00:15:07,385 --> 00:15:09,173
Get moving. I'll hold them off.

170
00:15:09,227 --> 00:15:12,755
You shall not escape. Come, Oki!

171
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:20,652
That's Kiun, Takemikazuchi's Regalia.

172
00:15:20,732 --> 00:15:24,832
Young Master! Kiun is also known as
the Thunder Blade, and for good reason.

173
00:15:25,015 --> 00:15:27,381
Your Phantoms won't be able to stand before him.

174
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:50,911
What's with them? They're pissed.

175
00:15:51,093 --> 00:15:53,666
I'm sorry for this. Are you okay?

176
00:15:55,634 --> 00:15:57,059
You're still alive!

177
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,444
How did you do that?

178
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:09,097
Ebisu, just go!

179
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:12,721
Thanks, my friend.

180
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,203
Running will do no good.

181
00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:27,791
Where'd everyone go?

182
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:29,332
Into the forest.

183
00:16:29,357 --> 00:16:36,125
All right. Kazuma. Push Kinuha's Borderlines
to maximum power. We're going to take out Kiun.

184
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:39,781
What? We can't take him out!

185
00:16:40,336 --> 00:16:41,384
Are you certain?

186
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,337
Kazuma?

187
00:16:42,745 --> 00:16:47,359
Yes, I am. Demonstrate your dominance, my Blessed Vessel.

188
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,099
Yes.

189
00:16:52,796 --> 00:16:57,546
You may be a Blessed Vessel, but I
am not threatened by a mere earring.

190
00:17:08,739 --> 00:17:09,972
We really hit him!

191
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,597
Not enough. I need to reach further than that.

192
00:17:15,422 --> 00:17:22,238
I must exceed his Borderlines and strike deeper.
I must believe that I am the dominant Regalia here.

193
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:26,758
And seize control!

194
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:37,659
A frightening display. That is what true power looks like.

195
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,687
Bishamonten and her Blessed Vessel.

196
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,185
Is it bad?

197
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:53,668
Yato!

198
00:17:54,852 --> 00:17:55,905
Yeah, Yukine?

199
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,147
Who the hell is Yaboku?

200
00:17:58,904 --> 00:18:01,486
And since when is "Yato" not your real name, huh?

201
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:04,530
How could you have lied to us this whole time?

202
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:06,808
It's complicated.

203
00:18:07,189 --> 00:18:08,841
Can we do this later?

204
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,062
I have to know. Why'd you go into the
underworld without saying a single word to us?

205
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,748
You just disappeared one day and
went and got yourself beaten to death!

206
00:18:17,773 --> 00:18:22,390
With all we've been though, you still
don't trust me. You're an idiot, you know that?

207
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,297
And a terrible master.

208
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:27,466
Okay, that's enough. Listen to me, I...

209
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:35,028
No. Let go of me! You'll get blighted, too!

210
00:18:35,805 --> 00:18:36,561
Yato.

211
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:37,355
Stop...

212
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,200
I know I haven't always been the
best Regalia, but, but I made an oath.

213
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:47,930
In case you've forgotten, I swore
I would risk my name to protect you!

214
00:18:48,904 --> 00:18:50,068
I haven't forgotten.

215
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,387
You're his Blessed Vessel.

216
00:18:54,212 --> 00:18:57,296
You guys, what's happening?

217
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:03,666
Is that what I think?

218
00:19:08,442 --> 00:19:10,133
A Pacification Ring!

219
00:19:25,883 --> 00:19:29,789
There you are. The next one won't miss, Ebisu.

220
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:40,871
How pure is the brightness of thy soul. How
pure the brightness of thy heart. How pure it is.

221
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:46,545
In the name of Takagi-no-kami,
we wield the heavenly wax-tree bow.

222
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:50,359
Incredible. I can't believe they're
actually using a Pacification Ring!

223
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:52,417
I've never heard of that before.

224
00:19:52,911 --> 00:19:57,638
It's something used to quell the
enemies of the heavens. A very ancient art.

225
00:19:58,146 --> 00:20:00,394
One hit from that thing and we're all dead.

226
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:03,691
I can't believe how far they're willing to take this.

227
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:08,576
This is insane! There's no reason for
them to drag the mortal world into it.

228
00:20:13,727 --> 00:20:14,750
Sekki!

229
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,252
What are you doing?

230
00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:23,441
You're the one they're going to all this trouble for.

231
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:28,214
The thing is, you made a wish
and I haven't granted it yet.

232
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,088
Another meal at the Olive Tavern, remember?

233
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:39,408
You're kidding! But you're not in any condition to be...

234
00:20:39,453 --> 00:20:41,710
I refuse to let them have their way!

235
00:20:42,698 --> 00:20:45,424
I know that I can trust you. Now, let's go!

236
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:55,250
Should thou be of pure heart, god Ebisu.
Should thou be pure of soul, the arrow shall miss.

237
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,397
Should thou be dark of heart,
the arrow shall tear thee asunder.

238
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:03,971
Farewell, Ebisu.

239
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:11,906
Look out! It's coming!

240
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:23,986
Rend!

241
00:21:42,224 --> 00:21:44,550
He cut through it? Impossible!

242
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:59,025
That was incredible! Yato god! He truly
is fearless. And so is his Blessed Vessel.

243
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:08,388
Veena, look!

244
00:22:09,499 --> 00:22:11,167
No! Run, Ebisu!

245
00:23:55,074 --> 00:23:58,226
Today, we'll teach you how to
make fluffy-fluff accessories.

246
00:23:58,251 --> 00:23:59,869
First, get some cotton fabric.

247
00:23:59,894 --> 00:24:01,736
Then you just take it and rip it up.

248
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:04,827
On the next Noragami Aragoto:
"The God of Fortune's Message."

249
00:24:04,852 --> 00:24:06,404
Here. You take it, Yato. You're not gonna wear it?

250
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:09,515
But it's so stylish! Come on!
