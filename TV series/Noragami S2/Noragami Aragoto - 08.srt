1
00:00:00,841 --> 00:00:03,944
It seems that Regalia are
limited in their use of Masked Ones.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,050
They do not have the power to turn Phantoms into puppets.

3
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,018
Only a name-bestowing god is able to do that.

4
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:13,498
Have you captured a Phantom?

5
00:00:14,365 --> 00:00:15,246
Yes.

6
00:00:15,287 --> 00:00:17,614
Good. Then let's begin at once.

7
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:28,617
My Earthly name is Ebisu. Bearing a posthumous name,
I don this mask, and proclaim myself a spirit vessel!

8
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:33,886
Ye names that assemble cannot defy me.
You are bound and beholden to my every order!

9
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:39,479
Submit yourself to me, and
obey the mask! Yield now, Ryoki!

10
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,793
What're you doin'? Who the hell do you think you are?

11
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:17,091
The guys who're gonna take you down, that's who!

12
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:18,167
Ah, kiss my ass!

13
00:02:18,524 --> 00:02:19,903
Like hell I will!

14
00:02:19,928 --> 00:02:21,888
We're gonna kill you!

15
00:02:21,913 --> 00:02:23,932
All right, that's enough!

16
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:32,527
This is the land of the Rising Sun. Your desecrations
shall not be allowed. Hear me. I am the god, Yato.

17
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:39,884
I now lay thee waste with the Sekki, and
expel thy vast defilement! I cleanse thee!

18
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:41,273
Rend!

19
00:02:45,777 --> 00:02:46,636
Uh...?

20
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:52,506
And thus, it's done, boys. May our fates intertwine.

21
00:02:56,543 --> 00:03:02,338
Make way! Hiyori is coming through! Yeah, that's
right, I'm talkin' to you, shorty! Outta the way!

22
00:03:02,363 --> 00:03:07,389
Look out, there's some gum there, watch your
step. Dandelion fuzz incoming! Quick, cover your ears!

23
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,624
Enough! Can't I walk to school in peace?

24
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:15,438
Sorry about that, Hiyori. He's
been a little overexcited lately.

25
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:19,380
'Course I have! See! Get a load of this, yo!

26
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:20,941
Resident registration card?

27
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:26,568
That's right! Takamagahara has officially
recognized this lil' beauty as my shrine!

28
00:03:26,593 --> 00:03:29,256
Seriously? They actually approved that thing?

29
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:30,216
Well, of course they did!

30
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:32,061
Come on, guys, please! Have a heart!

31
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:36,753
I visited the office every day right
before closing time until they finally caved!

32
00:03:36,778 --> 00:03:38,947
Man, talk about lax!

33
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,894
I guess government officials are the same everywhere.

34
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,986
Does this new status come with any perks?

35
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:50,996
It sure does. I can attend things called Colloquies
now. I'm licensed to sell official merchandise.

36
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:53,803
And I even have my very own holy book and song.

37
00:03:53,828 --> 00:03:55,362
Which you wrote yourself!

38
00:03:55,387 --> 00:03:57,510
It doesn't seem much different than before to me.

39
00:03:57,535 --> 00:04:02,985
Oh, but wait! I saved the best perk for last!
Tad-ah! My own plot of land in Takamagahara!

40
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,266
It's tiny!

41
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:07,212
You know what this means, don't you?
We'll always have somewhere to sleep.

42
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:09,459
Yeah, I think I'll stick with Kofuku's place.

43
00:04:09,484 --> 00:04:13,511
And now that we've got a shrine, we can
visit the Heavenly Realm whenever we want to!

44
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:14,392
Not bad!

45
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:15,809
That is pretty cool!

46
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:20,297
And all of it's thanks to you. Really.
I'm glad you didn't give up on me.

47
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:22,481
Sure. You're welcome.

48
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:28,518
Hello there! Nice to meet you, I'm
Yato! I just moved into the neighborhood.

49
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:34,104
I have some young Regalia, and they need their sleep.
I hope you boys don't make too much noise after dark.

50
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:36,647
Nope! Quiet as mice, don't you worry.

51
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:39,218
You didn't hear it from me, but apparently...

52
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:42,022
Oh, my! Positively appalling!

53
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:43,089
Really!

54
00:04:45,638 --> 00:04:48,553
Guess what, guess what! Yama's got a crush on someone!

55
00:04:48,578 --> 00:04:51,414
Say it a little louder. I don't
think the whole school heard you!

56
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:53,200
Geez, Ami! Tell me more! What's he like?

57
00:04:53,225 --> 00:04:56,289
I don't really know much about him
except that he's in a higher grade than us.

58
00:04:56,314 --> 00:04:59,661
Oh-ho! An older man, huh? What else? What else?

59
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:04,899
He transferred here last spring. And his voice!
He sounds just like the Hundred Archfiends' singer!

60
00:05:04,924 --> 00:05:06,721
Hey, Iki!

61
00:05:07,258 --> 00:05:13,512
Hi, Manabu! How've you been doing? Getting
along any better with your classmates these days?

62
00:05:13,537 --> 00:05:19,368
A little bit. At least, I'm not getting bullied
anymore. But still, I'm basically invisible to everybody.

63
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:22,533
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. School can be rough, huh?

64
00:05:22,602 --> 00:05:24,016
Nah, it's no big deal.

65
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:30,111
When I do get down though, I remember what you
said: "Find one special person and you're set," right?

66
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:32,072
Did I say that?

67
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:35,052
Yeah. You gave me a lot of really good advice.

68
00:05:35,696 --> 00:05:40,621
Use this, sweetie. But remember, if you're gonna
fight rough, then your opponent should be armed, too.

69
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:44,997
Wha...? I never said anything
like that! No way! You mean Yato.

70
00:05:45,022 --> 00:05:47,031
It was him who gave you advice.

71
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:47,816
Yato?

72
00:05:47,841 --> 00:05:53,357
Yeah, you know, the guy in the tracksuit. He and Yukine
were in the girls' bathroom, so I beat them up, remember?

73
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,359
No idea. Sorry.

74
00:05:56,535 --> 00:06:00,158
Well, a-anyway. You were really
there for me when I needed it.

75
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:05,228
And... there's something I've been wanting to
tell you since then. I don't know how to say this.

76
00:06:05,307 --> 00:06:09,586
The thing is, I... I... Like... Like...

77
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:12,961
I like your shoes! They're really nice! Bye!

78
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,498
Why doesn't he remember Yato?

79
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:23,919
Excuse me, my lady. You have a visitor.

80
00:06:24,212 --> 00:06:24,991
Yukine?

81
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:28,605
Hello, Lady Bishamon. I'm sorry to bother you.

82
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,577
What do you want? Are you alone?

83
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:39,299
Um, yes. I've come to say hello for my loser of a master.
We've just been granted land in Takamagahara, you see.

84
00:06:39,324 --> 00:06:41,102
Here? The Yato god?

85
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:42,383
Yes...?

86
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:46,059
A-Actually. That's not all.

87
00:06:46,084 --> 00:06:48,738
I have a personal request. For Kazuma.

88
00:06:49,198 --> 00:06:49,692
Uh...

89
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:57,144
Could you teach me how to use invocations? Say yes.
I'm Yato's exemplar. I wanna keep getting stronger.

90
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:58,734
Please help me do that!

91
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:01,156
Well, I...

92
00:07:04,854 --> 00:07:06,789
Yes. I would be happy to.

93
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:10,148
All right! I'll work really hard, I swear!

94
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:13,462
Please don't let them live nearby.

95
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:18,071
You're awfully quiet. Whatcha lookin' at, Yori?

96
00:07:18,532 --> 00:07:21,100
Yato's been acting really weird lately.

97
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:24,998
If we're not together, he sends me a
text like every five minutes. Look at this!

98
00:07:25,023 --> 00:07:26,761
Whoa! There're hundreds!

99
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:28,869
And this isn't even the half of it.

100
00:07:29,118 --> 00:07:31,101
Looks like a good parade. We should go.

101
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:35,945
They've got a couple's room here. What
do you think, huh? A gondola ride, ooh!

102
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:38,123
I was just callin' to say hi!

103
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:43,739
That kind of behavior's only
natural. You are Yatty's first.

104
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:46,406
That may not be the best way to put it, Kofuku.

105
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,333
There aren't many people out
there who even know Yatty exists.

106
00:07:49,358 --> 00:07:54,846
And nobody was ever so determined to stick with
him before you came along. Honestly, I'm relieved.

107
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:57,068
This means he can lead another long life.

108
00:07:57,093 --> 00:07:57,752
What?

109
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:03,116
Yatty has always had a hard time attracting
long-term believers and dedicated Regalia.

110
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,811
He's had to survive within
people's broken, scattered memories.

111
00:08:07,057 --> 00:08:10,004
I can only imagine how difficult that must have been.

112
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:16,854
Famous gods like me and the Seven Gods of Fortune
are lucky. We don't have to worry about that stuff.

113
00:08:17,132 --> 00:08:20,042
It's totally different for unknown gods like Yatty.

114
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:23,863
Once they've been forgotten, they vanish from existence.

115
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,277
Like forever?

116
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:35,491
Yeah. A god is born from the wishes people make, you
know. When those wishes stop coming, he loses his purpose.

117
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:39,360
He vanishes for good. No reincarnation or anything.

118
00:08:40,915 --> 00:08:46,571
That's why this is so great. 'Cause Yatty has someone
to remember him. A believer he can really count on.

119
00:08:47,382 --> 00:08:49,088
I get his reaction now.

120
00:08:51,608 --> 00:08:54,561
Wait! What if I do forget him? Will he vanish?

121
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:57,399
No, no. I wouldn't worry about it too much.

122
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,349
After all, he's survived this long, hasn't he?

123
00:09:00,953 --> 00:09:04,011
I'm guessing he's got some other believers out there.

124
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:11,731
I've always wondered that about Yato. How
could such an unknown god endure for centuries?

125
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:13,427
He should've vanished long ago.

126
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,836
Bit of a mystery, really.

127
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:21,883
Now, in order for an invocation to
work, it needs to be tied to a name.

128
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:25,478
Which leads us to Rule Number
One: Know the name of your target.

129
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:29,443
But your name's right on your hand where
anyone can see it. Isn't that sorta risky?

130
00:09:29,498 --> 00:09:34,854
Yes. Rule Number Two: Invocations
won't work on those of greater status.

131
00:09:35,515 --> 00:09:40,502
To use an invocation is to impose
submission. It's actually a terrible act.

132
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,649
As such, it could even harm your own master.

133
00:09:44,038 --> 00:09:46,254
So think carefully before using one.

134
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:47,645
Right.

135
00:09:48,845 --> 00:09:53,969
When you act, do so with confidence. You're a
Blessed Vessel. Make sure your opponent knows that.

136
00:09:54,455 --> 00:09:55,631
What do you mean?

137
00:09:55,837 --> 00:10:00,650
How should I put it? Always treat
your opponent with... contempt, I guess.

138
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:01,634
Uh...

139
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,799
And Rule Three: There is no such thing as practice.

140
00:10:17,244 --> 00:10:17,957
Restraint!

141
00:10:18,915 --> 00:10:24,457
Too slow! You need to draw more quickly.
Till you're called or it wears off, you're stuck.

142
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,067
Uh... Huh?

143
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,491
Just keeping score. Now, let's go again. Yukine.

144
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:34,258
Dammit!

145
00:10:34,762 --> 00:10:35,580
Restraint!

146
00:10:36,534 --> 00:10:37,774
Too slow! Again!

147
00:10:37,956 --> 00:10:38,201
Again?

148
00:10:38,226 --> 00:10:39,092
Restraint!

149
00:10:39,117 --> 00:10:39,244
Borderline!

150
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,982
Restraint!

151
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:45,473
That's hilarious!

152
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:49,526
Kazuma needs to find a new way of
keeping score. I don't like this one!

153
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:51,854
Ah! Don't take pictures!

154
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,323
You did your best. That's what matters.

155
00:10:55,293 --> 00:10:58,986
Oh, come on. Don't cry. How
'bout I take you to Capypa Land?

156
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:00,440
Hell no, you freak!

157
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:04,328
Aww! But I wanna go to Capypa Land! I wanna! I wanna!

158
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:07,336
You don't need to drag me along
with you. Just go by yourself!

159
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:10,585
No way! I can't go on all the rides all alone!

160
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,316
Shut up!

161
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:11,590
Please!

162
00:11:11,615 --> 00:11:13,660
I wanna see the Capypas! You kown that.

163
00:11:13,787 --> 00:11:15,233
It'll be fun, I swear!

164
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,421
But seriously, I think the three of us should go.

165
00:11:18,485 --> 00:11:23,044
You, me, and Hiyori. We all gotta go to
Capypa Land and get our picture together!

166
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,911
I don't think I've ever seen you look so happy before.

167
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,380
You are unusually chipper.

168
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:28,948
Well, whaddya expect?

169
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:32,379
My centuries-long dream has finally come true.

170
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:34,938
I have a shrine of my own.

171
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:40,841
I was told I didn't need one. I
almost gave up hope entirely after that.

172
00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:44,924
If only my kid self could see me now. He'd be so happy.

173
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:48,578
Hold on, you were actually a kid once? I don't buy it!

174
00:11:48,603 --> 00:11:49,229
Aw!

175
00:11:50,004 --> 00:11:54,424
Yato as a kid... Who would have
said something like that to him?

176
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,381
Hey!

177
00:11:56,691 --> 00:12:00,694
Easy, there. He must be real
drunk. He never talks about his past.

178
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:04,120
All right. I should get going.

179
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:05,662
Hold on. I'll walk you.

180
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:07,536
Have a good night, Yori!

181
00:12:08,163 --> 00:12:09,809
I'm happy! So very happy...

182
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,142
Yeah, yeah.

183
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:15,992
I'm on my own two feet now, and it's all thanks to Hiyori.

184
00:12:16,388 --> 00:12:21,299
On your own two feet? Not if you're relying
on a schoolgirl all the time, you're not.

185
00:12:21,556 --> 00:12:27,633
I've decided. I'm gonna make Hiyori the
happiest girl in the world. You just watch me!

186
00:12:29,735 --> 00:12:32,342
I don't know if you meant that the way it sounded.

187
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,212
It's totally different for unknown gods like Yatty.

188
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:42,685
Once forgotten, they vanish from existence.

189
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:46,466
If only my kid self could see me now. He'd be so happy

190
00:12:47,872 --> 00:12:53,341
Yato... I wonder. What kind of life have you lived?

191
00:13:11,854 --> 00:13:14,903
I wasn't sure you would actually come, but you did.

192
00:13:15,237 --> 00:13:17,778
I came because we need to talk, Hiiro.

193
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,322
Do you know how nice it is to hear you say my name?

194
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,523
I've decided I want to end things with you.

195
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:26,644
And why's that?

196
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:29,519
Because I've got my own shrine now.

197
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:32,905
And there's Yukine. He's become a solid Regalia.

198
00:13:33,836 --> 00:13:35,805
I don't want to betray those things.

199
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,831
And that's why you've decided to release me?

200
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,174
Is that so bad?

201
00:13:40,563 --> 00:13:44,265
You have plenty of other
masters. You don't need me anymore.

202
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:47,118
Tell me, who made me a Nora, Yato?

203
00:13:48,607 --> 00:13:52,100
You're horrible. We've been together all this time.

204
00:13:53,086 --> 00:13:56,511
And now you're just going to
abandon me without a second thought?

205
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:01,888
Come! Hiki!

206
00:14:07,028 --> 00:14:07,845
A mask!

207
00:14:10,277 --> 00:14:11,156
Not you again...

208
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:14,859
Come. You should join us.

209
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:22,544
I think that will do for now.

210
00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:32,483
You know you won't be able to fight off so many Phantoms
without a Regalia. Aw, so weak and sad. Poor little Yato.

211
00:14:32,508 --> 00:14:40,292
You can't exist without a lifeline. Now be a good boy
and do what Father says. Things will be easier that way.

212
00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:52,702
Hey, sorry to bother you. But has Yato come back yet?

213
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:53,582
Sure hasn't.

214
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:57,214
He's been gone for an entire week
now. Something must have happened to him!

215
00:14:57,239 --> 00:15:01,601
You know what he's like. There's no way he could
stay silent this long unless there was a reason!

216
00:15:01,626 --> 00:15:03,374
See, that's where you're wrong.

217
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:07,555
It's not really that unusual.
Yatty goes into hiding sometimes.

218
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:10,777
His Regalia used to show up here a lot, looking for him.

219
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:18,332
Still not back? That's my master for ya. Well,
anyway, see ya, I'm gonna go meet up with Kazuma.

220
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,799
Training's a good way to start the morning.

221
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:26,070
You're working so hard to improve your
skills. In the meantime, what's Yato doing?

222
00:15:26,095 --> 00:15:28,985
How should I know? He's probably with Nora.

223
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,578
He seems upset.

224
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,508
I'm afraid Yato hasn't been by here.

225
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:37,629
Oh, okay.

226
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:39,003
Just a moment.

227
00:15:39,028 --> 00:15:39,481
Uh?

228
00:15:39,786 --> 00:15:42,296
It's fine for you to be concerned about Yato, Hiyori.

229
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:46,432
Understandable, even. But please try to
keep your devotion in check, won't you?

230
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,424
Are you attending school?

231
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,708
You aren't spending more time with gods and
Regalia than with your friends and family, are you?

232
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:55,875
Uh... No, not at all.

233
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:02,304
Really? And what about your hobbies? Are
you engaged in ordinary teenage pursuits?

234
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:04,466
Do you even have a boyfriend, young lady?

235
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:06,349
Lord, that's quite rude.

236
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,985
Go forth and enjoy your adolescence!

237
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,946
Um, okay.

238
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:16,416
I can't believe Yato! He hasn't
even told Yukine what he's up to!

239
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:22,009
Well, he better not blame me if everyone
forgets him! Not that that's likely to...

240
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:29,358
Manabu forgot. Could that happen to me, too?

241
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:33,927
No! I won't forget! There's no way!

242
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:37,589
I hope that doesn't turn out to be a lie.

243
00:16:39,656 --> 00:16:42,483
Whoa! Are you okay?

244
00:16:43,985 --> 00:16:46,901
That's dangerous. Better watch your step.

245
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:53,852
Hey! Thanks for catching me!

246
00:16:57,055 --> 00:17:03,165
My daughter was murdered. But they won't seek capital
punishment because it was the killer's first crime.

247
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:13,080
I saw him in the courtroom. He was smiling. Please!
My sweet daughter deserves justice! Will you avenge her?

248
00:17:13,105 --> 00:17:17,314
I've heard that you do that
sort of thing. Say yes! Please!

249
00:17:19,286 --> 00:17:22,653
Keep it. For what I'm asking...

250
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,480
This will be plenty.

251
00:17:31,575 --> 00:17:35,970
So what's the plan? Cut him up on the inside?

252
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,030
Huh?

253
00:17:46,193 --> 00:17:48,038
Come, Hiki.

254
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:53,717
Who... Who are you? Stop!

255
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:05,803
I just received a call from the prison
officials. He died from "undetermined causes."

256
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:11,992
Now my daughter can rest in peace.
Thank you, sir. Thank you so much!

257
00:18:12,046 --> 00:18:17,516
See? People appreciate this type of
job a lot more than cleaning bathrooms.

258
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:22,205
The Yato god could never perform such
great deeds with Yukine as his Regalia.

259
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:25,685
You didn't actually think you
could stand on your own two feet?

260
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:29,576
I don't know what that girl may
have told you, but it was nonsense.

261
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:36,851
Nothing's changed, can't you see that? It's been
this way forever. Everyone has always abandoned you.

262
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:43,548
You're a god of calamity. Hiyori and Yukine
will never really accept that aspect of you.

263
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:50,984
We do. You see, we understand what you
are. We'll never betray you. Or stray from you.

264
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,438
Because we love you, Yato.

265
00:18:54,248 --> 00:18:58,164
Well, what happened this time? I've never
known a god whose health was so fragile.

266
00:18:58,189 --> 00:18:58,799
Easy.

267
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,804
Lord Okuninushi, Lady Bishamoan. We are most honored.

268
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:07,526
We're the two pillars of the Gods of Fortune, so
it'd be nice if you would quit slackin' off, Ebisu!

269
00:19:07,756 --> 00:19:09,392
A little quieter, please.

270
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:15,392
Shut up. I'm tired of visiting your sick ass. Get better
and come to my Hawaiian shrine so we can catch some waves.

271
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:17,473
I'd rather go fishing.

272
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,691
No problem, I've got a boat. We'll
go catch some mahi-mahi or somethin'.

273
00:19:22,055 --> 00:19:25,273
What happened? Were you
blighted? Did you hold an ablution?

274
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:27,228
I'm tired now.

275
00:19:30,843 --> 00:19:36,706
Pardon me, Lord Okuninushi, Lady Bishamon.
I truly hate to ask this, but perhaps...

276
00:19:36,731 --> 00:19:42,738
Yeah, all right, we get it. We'll
come back later. Don't let him die.

277
00:19:44,698 --> 00:19:47,578
I don't trust those fools any
further than I can throw 'em.

278
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:50,905
How many more times are his
Regalia gonna pull this kinda crap?

279
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:53,996
Ebisu does reincarnate with disturbing frequency.

280
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,650
I know! Do those bastards even
care about their master at all?

281
00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:01,955
Why does he bother to keep them around?

282
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:08,940
Lord Ebisu.

283
00:20:09,456 --> 00:20:10,424
Where have they gone?

284
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:12,992
Your visitors have left, my lord.

285
00:20:13,063 --> 00:20:17,688
Turn away anybody else who comes by as
well. I need to be alone for a while, thank you.

286
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:19,674
No one shall disturb you.

287
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:30,327
What a shame. It seems I'm not very compatible with Ryoki.
All the Phantoms I turn into puppets eventually taint me.

288
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,005
I must rectify that.

289
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,362
Yes, who's there? I asked that I be undisturbed.

290
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,110
Ah, so it's you.

291
00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:45,700
Really?

292
00:20:47,391 --> 00:20:49,237
You've found the Locution Brushes?

293
00:20:50,271 --> 00:20:52,962
Uh! Wait! Stop! I'll turn myself in!

294
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:10,846
Look at the irises blooming!
It's that time of year already?

295
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:13,293
Tell me, Hiiro.

296
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:14,381
Hm?

297
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:20,053
How much longer are you gonna
make me do this? I've had enough.

298
00:21:22,644 --> 00:21:26,466
How long have I been here? Has it been a month now?

299
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:32,710
Hiyori! Has it been too long? Has she forgotten me?

300
00:21:35,046 --> 00:21:35,586
What is it?

301
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:37,373
I need to go back right now.

302
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:39,382
Back to Hiyori!

303
00:21:40,595 --> 00:21:41,776
Damn it!

304
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:46,924
Stay back!

305
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:50,027
Lord Yato. Please try to calm yourself.

306
00:21:50,052 --> 00:21:51,345
Let me out!

307
00:21:53,017 --> 00:21:56,040
Let me go! I want outta here, now!

308
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:59,884
Stay the hell out of my way!

309
00:22:02,198 --> 00:22:09,177
There you are, Father. Yato's saying that he wants to
leave. I don't understand. He's never said that before.

310
00:22:09,852 --> 00:22:12,441
Really? Are you sure, Father?

311
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:18,829
Yato. We have a job for you. He says
you're free to do as you wish once it's done.

312
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:23,062
We need to travel to the underworld
and rescue a conjurer there.

313
00:22:23,126 --> 00:22:24,390
The underworld?

314
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,920
The Hundred Archfiends rock!

315
00:23:56,945 --> 00:23:58,731
No! Zenny's is way cooler!

316
00:23:58,756 --> 00:24:00,955
Tie-breaker. We'll text Hiyori and ask her!

317
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,433
On the next Noragami Aragoto:
"The Sound of a Thread Snapping."

318
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:07,272
Well? She says "victory is decided with fists."

319
00:24:07,297 --> 00:24:09,343
Ugh! Martial arts fans!
