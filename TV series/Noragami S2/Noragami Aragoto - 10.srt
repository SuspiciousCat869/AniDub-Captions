1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,732
I'm sure you already studied
basic factorization in junior high.

2
00:00:04,278 --> 00:00:06,273
Good news: The method remains the same.

3
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:11,927
Think of the process as splitting an expression
into smaller, more manageable expressions.

4
00:00:13,729 --> 00:00:15,368
No way. Seriously?

5
00:00:17,312 --> 00:00:21,724
Things went pretty well at Capypa Land, so I
invited her to a Hundred Archfiends concert.

6
00:00:23,397 --> 00:00:24,463
Wait, Hiyori!

7
00:02:24,235 --> 00:02:26,238
Hiyori! It's been awhile!

8
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:29,529
Oh, you've switched uniforms.

9
00:02:29,764 --> 00:02:31,477
Is it that time of year already?

10
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:32,762
Uh...

11
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:35,863
It's easy to lose track of that stuff in Takamagahara.

12
00:02:36,097 --> 00:02:40,029
Anyway, I've been really busy
studying invocations with Kazuma.

13
00:02:40,316 --> 00:02:43,905
So I haven't exactly had time to
finish the homework you assigned me.

14
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:46,692
I'm so sorry! You understand, right?

15
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:49,302
Maybe I could get an extension?

16
00:02:50,113 --> 00:02:52,267
I, uh...

17
00:02:53,762 --> 00:02:58,336
Wait, that says Yuki... Yukine.

18
00:02:58,482 --> 00:03:00,526
Yep. That is my name.

19
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:01,904
Yukine!

20
00:03:01,988 --> 00:03:02,992
Whoa, hey!

21
00:03:03,154 --> 00:03:06,381
This smell, this nice smell.

22
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:08,803
I remember everything!

23
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:12,985
Yukine, Yato, the promise I made!

24
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:16,975
I can't believe I almost forgot all of it!

25
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:19,613
Hey! What's up with you?

26
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,821
Geez! You're an idiot! What were you
thinking? Don't ever do that again, Hiyori!

27
00:03:27,904 --> 00:03:29,863
'Kay. Sorry.

28
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:35,488
So, anyway. What's Yato been up to these days?

29
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:36,843
How should I know?

30
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:39,451
It's been more than a month
now since I heard from the guy.

31
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:42,071
I wouldn't waste my time worrying. What a big jerk.

32
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:44,437
Gone a whole month?

33
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:47,946
My lady hasn't come back yet either.

34
00:03:48,236 --> 00:03:49,529
Hi, Daikoku.

35
00:03:49,613 --> 00:03:51,988
Oh, hey, Hiyori. Long time no see, huh?

36
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,380
She still isn't back? Hasn't it been awhile?

37
00:03:54,531 --> 00:03:55,358
Yeah.

38
00:03:55,571 --> 00:03:58,843
I haven't heard from her since I
was sent home from the latest Colloquy.

39
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:00,654
It's weird, too.

40
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:02,902
They usually can't stand the sight of her there.

41
00:04:03,187 --> 00:04:04,516
I don't like this.

42
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:07,238
I know. Kazuma feels the same way.

43
00:04:07,501 --> 00:04:10,022
He says it's strange there've been all these meetings.

44
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:14,563
There are so many entries in my date book about them.

45
00:04:15,854 --> 00:04:17,811
And then they just suddenly stopped.

46
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:24,043
I hope everything... What're you doing?

47
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:25,571
I'm gonna go out and look for Yato.

48
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,090
Wait, you're gonna do what?

49
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:28,937
Hold on! Hiyori!

50
00:04:31,993 --> 00:04:34,159
I almost forgot him once before.

51
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:36,827
But I was so stupid and cocky this time.

52
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:39,160
Yato!

53
00:04:39,263 --> 00:04:42,835
Idiot! I was so sure I would never forget.

54
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:45,291
Like I was different or special somehow.

55
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:48,488
Because our ties hadn't been cut.

56
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:52,592
But I'm not an exception at all!

57
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:56,888
It's totally different for unknown gods like Yatty.

58
00:04:57,243 --> 00:05:00,312
Once they've been forgotten, they vanish from existence.

59
00:05:00,493 --> 00:05:04,063
Yato!

60
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,925
I don't even know where to look.

61
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:16,021
Because, the truth is, I don't know Yato at all.

62
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:20,534
Stay with me! Stay!

63
00:05:20,618 --> 00:05:22,995
Damn it! What are these creepy things?

64
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:26,219
They must be Izanami's Beldams. They're under her control.

65
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,775
Don't let them catch you, understand?

66
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:30,687
You'll be trapped here forever.

67
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,254
Yuki! Hold them off.

68
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:36,693
Sir.

69
00:05:38,701 --> 00:05:39,993
That was incredible.

70
00:05:40,076 --> 00:05:41,368
The brush really does work.

71
00:05:41,451 --> 00:05:43,743
It allowed me to summon a Phantom using only a name.

72
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:46,992
That's enough "ooh-ing" and
"ah-ing"! We need to get away from them!

73
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:49,578
How do we even get outta here?

74
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:51,368
It's almost labyrinthine, isn't it?

75
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,909
I think it's more than that.

76
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:55,268
It's like the whole place is expanding.

77
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:57,269
Why are you running away?

78
00:05:57,826 --> 00:06:00,307
We'll be good friends if you'll stay with me.

79
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:06,253
Hey! Earlier, when we first tried
to leave, you called her "Mother."

80
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:08,990
If you're her son, can't you do something?

81
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:14,512
I wanted to discover more about my own
origins, so I consulted the old literature.

82
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:17,002
One story says that she abandoned me.

83
00:06:17,734 --> 00:06:19,967
If that's true, then she clearly didn't want me.

84
00:06:20,326 --> 00:06:23,143
So I don't know how our
relationship will make any difference.

85
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:26,826
It's got me!

86
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:30,205
They can't be cut!

87
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:32,866
Just let go, damn it!

88
00:06:38,243 --> 00:06:39,406
Young Master...!

89
00:06:41,493 --> 00:06:42,909
Tatsumi! Utami!

90
00:06:42,993 --> 00:06:44,159
Ooh, I want it!

91
00:06:44,243 --> 00:06:45,159
No, he's mine!

92
00:06:45,243 --> 00:06:46,515
I saw him first!

93
00:06:47,284 --> 00:06:48,199
Come on!

94
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:58,628
Hiiro. How could you?

95
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:02,231
He got away, didn't he? You should be thankful.

96
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:05,951
Now we can fulfill Father's request.

97
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:08,409
You're the conjurer we were sent to rescue.

98
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:11,967
I have to get Ebisu out at all costs.

99
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:15,102
Why do you want him so badly, old man?

100
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:16,868
What's your game?

101
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:17,985
Yato god.

102
00:07:19,118 --> 00:07:21,899
I should be all right now. Let's go.

103
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:25,361
All the previous Ebisus died for this.

104
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:29,778
I must leave here with the Locution Brush.

105
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,574
Why are you so obsessed with it?

106
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,098
Your other incarnations are dead.

107
00:07:35,326 --> 00:07:36,451
Their work can die with them.

108
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:38,428
This is what I am meant to do!

109
00:07:42,493 --> 00:07:44,368
It's my purpose.

110
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:46,113
Is that something you can understand?

111
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:52,709
The world is filled with senseless
violence and unnecessary pain.

112
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,002
That's why we gods are so important.

113
00:07:55,914 --> 00:07:57,443
But with this Locution Brush,

114
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:02,291
I'll be able to restrain Phantoms and prevent
at least some of the misfortune they cause.

115
00:08:02,618 --> 00:08:06,125
I can use it to make the world a
better, less painful place to live.

116
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:09,572
Does that answer your question?

117
00:08:15,826 --> 00:08:17,784
All this, for humanity's sake?

118
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:20,919
I didn't think guys like that actually existed.

119
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:24,290
Where are you?

120
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:26,567
Where did my friends go?

121
00:08:28,951 --> 00:08:31,932
This whole time I assumed he was doing it for power.

122
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:36,328
Such a fierce will. I'll never have that.

123
00:08:37,368 --> 00:08:40,159
You're a god of calamity. Don't you see?

124
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:42,617
This is the sort of work you should be doing.

125
00:08:42,993 --> 00:08:44,326
Thank you...

126
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:46,609
People appreciate this type of job a lot more.

127
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:53,181
Well done. Very well done, Yato.

128
00:09:00,784 --> 00:09:03,120
Found you!

129
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:08,278
I've always done everything I was told to do.

130
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:10,228
It just seemed easier that way.

131
00:09:12,076 --> 00:09:13,609
But that's gonna change.

132
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:16,504
I wanna be someone people respect.

133
00:09:18,493 --> 00:09:20,894
Someone who she can be proud to have in her life!

134
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:30,185
Kunimi! Go! Take Ebisu and get outta here!

135
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:34,623
What? Wait. You can't kill Izanami.

136
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,113
Don't have to kill her.

137
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:40,955
I just have to hold her off. That much I can do.

138
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,044
Yato-no-Kami.

139
00:09:47,743 --> 00:09:50,731
His name is similar, but he can't be our Yato.

140
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:53,671
He has a shrine and even appears in stories.

141
00:09:56,611 --> 00:09:59,042
It looks like Ebisu has multiple names.

142
00:10:01,354 --> 00:10:05,225
And Bishamonten also goes by Vaisravana?

143
00:10:05,826 --> 00:10:07,568
Huh. Strange.

144
00:10:07,701 --> 00:10:10,184
I wonder if Yato has another name, too.

145
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:14,013
There are so many gods described in these books,

146
00:10:14,284 --> 00:10:16,993
but I can't find anything that even mentions him.

147
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,111
There's nothing online, either.

148
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:22,079
All I can see are his social network pages.

149
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:25,417
I know! I'll ask Mayu.

150
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:28,220
The heavens are in disorder?

151
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:31,963
Yes. I just returned from Lord Ebisu's estate.

152
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:38,368
They have the whole area cordoned off,
and I was even threatened by armed Sentinels.

153
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,534
Wait, what's a sentinel?

154
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:43,805
They're the Regalia that serve the heavens.

155
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:47,491
But Sentinels aren't usually armed.
Something really big must be going on.

156
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:49,034
We were there recently.

157
00:10:49,118 --> 00:10:51,568
So I know Lord Ebisu has been corrupted.

158
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:53,779
It's likely he'll perish again.

159
00:10:55,326 --> 00:10:59,782
The heavens have always tolerated his
excessive corruptions and reincarnations.

160
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:04,028
But not this time. For some reason, this is different.

161
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:05,354
Yeah, no doubt.

162
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:09,701
Hm. I was hoping to ask for your help, Tsuyu.

163
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:14,040
You can find out what's happening in Takamagahara,

164
00:11:14,902 --> 00:11:16,736
and with more certainty than I can.

165
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,756
Will you please consider helping us?

166
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:20,587
No, Sir Kazuma.

167
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:23,932
I cannot afford to jeopardize my lord's standing.

168
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:27,368
We should wait to receive word before doing anything.

169
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:29,846
Or do you mean to antagonize the heavens?

170
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:36,244
They have the Gods of Fortune.
They're likely being questioned.

171
00:11:37,502 --> 00:11:39,463
Perhaps even being tortured.

172
00:11:43,826 --> 00:11:47,016
I understand. I know how it is to fear for one's master.

173
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,287
Very well.

174
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:56,838
What? What's this?

175
00:11:57,326 --> 00:11:59,498
Tsuyu is speaking with the trees.

176
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:03,576
She isn't a Regalia, you know.
She's the spirit of a plum tree.

177
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:09,751
It is said that, long ago, she traveled
all the way to Dazaifu to be with Lord Tenjin.

178
00:12:10,326 --> 00:12:14,062
She's been his companion since. For more than 1,000 years.

179
00:12:14,743 --> 00:12:17,926
Her affection for him is deep,
and it will not ever wither.

180
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:23,058
Conjurer. Masks. Phantoms.

181
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,229
Echoes of discord among the gods.

182
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:29,687
The heavens are searching for Lord Ebisu and his exemplar.

183
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:31,825
Really?

184
00:12:33,714 --> 00:12:36,326
There is a peach tree located near the Verge.

185
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:39,210
It saw Lord Ebisu head into the underworld.

186
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:40,951
The underworld?

187
00:12:41,034 --> 00:12:42,368
What could possibly send him there?

188
00:12:42,451 --> 00:12:43,995
He had pursuers.

189
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:49,393
A young male god with a lean frame and
a short girl in white wearing a crown.

190
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:50,585
That's...

191
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,990
Nora. It must be, right?

192
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,510
That sounds like Yato and Nora.

193
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:04,665
Oshi!

194
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:08,141
Just how long you gonna keep
us locked up in this damn place?

195
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:11,848
We have just discovered that
Lord Ebisu is, indeed, the conjurer.

196
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:13,971
An edict has been issued for his death.

197
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:15,951
Punishment for disrupting the heavens.

198
00:13:16,034 --> 00:13:16,618
What?

199
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:20,582
How are you so sure it's him?

200
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:25,302
We conducted a search of his residence
and found a large number of masks there.

201
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:29,258
He also had many Phantoms in his care, evidently.

202
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:34,618
Furthermore, we discovered that most of
his Regalia are actually Noras. Disgraceful.

203
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:35,650
But what of Ebisu?

204
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:39,826
Lord Ebisu appears to have ventured into the underworld.

205
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:42,368
Likely to procure more Phantoms, we suspect.

206
00:13:42,451 --> 00:13:44,784
That sounds like a bunch of crap. I don't believe it.

207
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:46,534
It is fact, I assure you.

208
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,034
Lord Ebisu is guilty.

209
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,826
His Regalia confessed everything after being interrogated.

210
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:53,651
Interrogated? What did you do?

211
00:13:54,743 --> 00:13:56,076
That's none of your concern.

212
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,409
The heavens now intend to call upon the gods.

213
00:13:58,493 --> 00:14:00,659
Lord Ebisu's behavior must be punished.

214
00:14:00,743 --> 00:14:01,598
By death?

215
00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:04,172
Why go straight to capital punishment?

216
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:06,964
It won't be easy to help him now.

217
00:14:07,118 --> 00:14:10,864
Not with the edict in place. It's over. He'll die.

218
00:14:11,368 --> 00:14:12,826
I'm not givin' in that easily.

219
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:13,738
Huh?

220
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:16,721
I won't argue with you about your damn edict.

221
00:14:17,076 --> 00:14:20,201
But if anybody is gonna kill him, it's gonna be me.

222
00:14:20,284 --> 00:14:21,301
Okuninushi?

223
00:14:23,618 --> 00:14:25,153
I'm afraid that won't do.

224
00:14:26,368 --> 00:14:29,076
You will remain here until the situation is resolved.

225
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,243
This way we can assure your innocence.

226
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:33,493
You must see that cooperation is in your best interest.

227
00:14:33,576 --> 00:14:34,949
Outta my way.

228
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:39,378
Go on. You heard me, now, move.

229
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:46,861
I'm bein' nice and respectful to you at the moment.
But remember, I have gone to war with the heavens before.

230
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:49,576
They called me the Bear!

231
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:52,392
The Spider! Everyone feared me!

232
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:55,326
Do something! You have to stop him!

233
00:14:57,784 --> 00:15:00,408
Is this what you want? Another fight?

234
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,951
A god without a Regalia is helpless.

235
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:04,890
Restraint!

236
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:09,576
Forgive my tardiness. Are you well, my lady?

237
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,929
Kazuma! I'm glad to see you!

238
00:15:14,576 --> 00:15:16,651
I wouldn't expect reinforcements.

239
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:19,474
They seem a bit under the weather.

240
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:24,005
A god without a Regalia is helpless, you say?

241
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:26,175
That's a dangerous thing to assert.

242
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:28,368
Really, High Sentinel Oshi.

243
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:34,243
I may be willing to forget you said it.

244
00:15:34,326 --> 00:15:36,347
Assuming that you withdraw now.

245
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:40,515
I believe she gets the point, Kazuma.

246
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:43,618
Benzaiten. Can you handle things here without me?

247
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:44,329
Go!

248
00:15:44,502 --> 00:15:47,784
While Fukurokuju sacrifices himself to Okuninushi!

249
00:15:47,868 --> 00:15:50,034
We may become the Six Gods of Fortune.

250
00:15:50,118 --> 00:15:51,859
Wait! I didn't agree to this!

251
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:56,289
We need to get to Ebisu quickly. Choki!

252
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:08,778
Let's see.

253
00:16:09,076 --> 00:16:11,168
The Underworld Entrance is that way.

254
00:16:12,116 --> 00:16:15,704
It's 20 minutes on foot. You up for a walk?

255
00:16:16,284 --> 00:16:18,743
The entrance to the underworld is a tourist spot.

256
00:16:18,826 --> 00:16:20,254
Pretty crazy, huh?

257
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:26,523
You're being really quiet. You still upset?

258
00:16:30,118 --> 00:16:32,240
Yato passed through here, I'm sure.

259
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:36,526
The others said there was no guarantee
it was him, but I think it must have been.

260
00:16:36,657 --> 00:16:38,519
Besides, it's our only lead.

261
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:41,491
Something's going on with him, and I wanna know what.

262
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:43,562
I want to hear it from him.

263
00:16:48,118 --> 00:16:51,095
Like I said before, I really
don't think you should come with me.

264
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:54,254
You can be majorly stubborn sometimes, you know that?

265
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:59,499
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

266
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,060
You're letting me come?

267
00:17:01,091 --> 00:17:04,341
Yes. But don't do anything dangerous, you got it?

268
00:17:05,118 --> 00:17:07,076
You're really important to Yato.

269
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,368
To both of us, honestly. No matter what.

270
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:12,355
I swear I'm gonna keep you safe.

271
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,909
Would you like some tea?

272
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:18,309
Something to eat?

273
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:22,109
Come. We'll have a nice chat.

274
00:17:22,493 --> 00:17:24,701
We need to split apart and purge the Beldams.

275
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:26,826
But what about Izanami?

276
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:29,883
I don't need to kill her. Just
be sure you maintain your blade!

277
00:17:30,576 --> 00:17:31,820
All right. I will.

278
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:38,059
We need to buy him enough time
to get outta here with that brush!

279
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,721
Young Master, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

280
00:17:45,076 --> 00:17:49,269
I'm fine, I think. But you must be in pain, too, though.

281
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,801
I'm little more than an encumbrance now.

282
00:17:53,576 --> 00:17:55,779
I owe the Yato god a great debt for this.

283
00:17:56,303 --> 00:17:58,474
You'll help me remember that, won't you?

284
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:04,723
Wha...? What's this smell? Salty, like blood.

285
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:08,888
No. Not blood. It's the sea!

286
00:18:10,784 --> 00:18:14,034
We're nearly outside. Iwami will be waiting for us.

287
00:18:23,326 --> 00:18:26,736
Oh, dear. It seems all the exits are sealed.

288
00:18:26,951 --> 00:18:30,222
Come, let's return to Lady Izanami now.

289
00:18:31,868 --> 00:18:34,293
I can't fight so many. This is the end.

290
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:42,159
The new young master certainly loves playing by the water.

291
00:18:42,243 --> 00:18:44,489
What little boy doesn't love fishing?

292
00:18:44,784 --> 00:18:48,916
I only hope he'll live long enough that we
won't need to call him the young master anymore.

293
00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:50,225
Hm?

294
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:51,763
True.

295
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:54,076
He reincarnates so frequently compared to other gods.

296
00:18:54,137 --> 00:18:55,232
I wonder why.

297
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,784
What's reincarnate?

298
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:58,623
To go away and then come back.

299
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:00,192
I don't understand.

300
00:19:00,576 --> 00:19:02,514
It's what happens when a god dies.

301
00:19:03,534 --> 00:19:05,368
It's okay, don't worry.

302
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:08,201
You are a very famous god, Lord Ebisu.

303
00:19:08,284 --> 00:19:11,493
A god like you will always be reborn after he dies.

304
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:13,908
See? There's no reason to be scared.

305
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:20,219
Young Master.

306
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,993
Borderline!

307
00:19:24,326 --> 00:19:25,201
It won't open.

308
00:19:25,284 --> 00:19:27,572
I don't get it. This should be the entrance. Damn it!

309
00:19:28,826 --> 00:19:29,868
Borderline! Borderline!

310
00:19:29,892 --> 00:19:30,326
Yato...

311
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:33,686
It's over. I've caught you.

312
00:19:33,993 --> 00:19:36,318
There's no escaping, precious one.

313
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,762
You fool.

314
00:19:38,951 --> 00:19:41,305
Didn't I warn you not to let her catch you?

315
00:19:42,826 --> 00:19:45,193
Now, then. Have a little taste.

316
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:48,016
This is it. I'm dead.

317
00:19:48,993 --> 00:19:50,200
Lady Izanami!

318
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:56,151
Please, release him. Take me.
I'll remain here with you instead.

319
00:19:58,354 --> 00:20:00,418
You will? That's wonderful!

320
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,298
Hey, what are you doing? Ebisu!

321
00:20:03,323 --> 00:20:06,426
Yato god. Take the Locution Brush.

322
00:20:07,826 --> 00:20:09,360
I know that I can trust you.

323
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:11,883
Just make sure Iwami gets this, all right?

324
00:20:12,317 --> 00:20:12,822
Huh?

325
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:15,539
Kunimi is in dire straits as well.

326
00:20:15,718 --> 00:20:18,156
I'd appreciate it if you'd take him with you.

327
00:20:19,076 --> 00:20:20,076
Wait, what about you?

328
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,189
I imagine I'll die before long.

329
00:20:23,462 --> 00:20:27,223
It's okay. I'll simply be born again, as I always am.

330
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:28,434
So, please.

331
00:20:29,178 --> 00:20:30,784
I don't accept that.

332
00:20:30,868 --> 00:20:33,034
All of this will be completely pointless if you die!

333
00:20:33,118 --> 00:20:35,076
I wanna help you. Do you understand?

334
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:37,463
And not because someone told me to!

335
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:39,713
Why do you wanna die so badly?

336
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:45,484
I don't actively want to die, but since I
just reincarnate, what does it matter if I do?

337
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:47,368
What about you as an individual?

338
00:20:47,451 --> 00:20:49,508
Is dying here really what you want?

339
00:20:49,993 --> 00:20:52,079
Is it really what this you wants?

340
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:55,152
This me? What do you mean?

341
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:57,833
Isn't there anyone you'll miss?

342
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,835
Someone you wanna see again? Something you wanna do again?

343
00:21:02,326 --> 00:21:04,023
Something I want to do again.

344
00:21:05,868 --> 00:21:06,954
I'm not sure.

345
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:10,243
I suppose I'd like to eat
another meal at the Olive Tavern.

346
00:21:10,326 --> 00:21:11,534
That'll do.

347
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:14,558
You have made a wish,and it has been heard loud and clear.

348
00:21:14,665 --> 00:21:16,453
You can pay me five yen later.

349
00:21:20,743 --> 00:21:22,347
Curse you!

350
00:21:22,868 --> 00:21:25,743
We can't escape her. We're trapped.

351
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,451
The exits have all been sealed.

352
00:21:27,534 --> 00:21:29,819
Don't you wanna master controlling Phantoms?

353
00:21:30,034 --> 00:21:32,479
How can you be ready to give up so easily?

354
00:21:34,951 --> 00:21:36,752
If there's no exit, make one.

355
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:39,088
Drill yourself a hole outta here!

356
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:43,283
That's completely crazy.

357
00:21:44,284 --> 00:21:46,518
Don't blame me for whatever comes next.

358
00:21:47,243 --> 00:21:51,784
Uki! Tekki! Shuki! Sakki! Gaki! Senki!

359
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,424
Go open a Vent, now!

360
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:56,201
As you wish!

361
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,289
Damn, he actually opened a Vent. Ha!

362
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:09,865
I'm burning up. I can't breathe.

363
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,331
Ebisu!

364
00:22:14,743 --> 00:22:15,788
Yato god?

365
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:57,284
Meow! Meow!

366
00:23:57,368 --> 00:23:59,701
Um, what are you doing, Yukine?

367
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:01,368
Practicing cat language.

368
00:24:01,451 --> 00:24:04,159
I'm gonna ask Yato if I can have a pet cat someday.

369
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:07,493
On the next Noragami Aragoto: "Revival."

370
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:09,784
Meow. Mew-meow!
