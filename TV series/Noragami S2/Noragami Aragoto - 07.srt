1
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:12,792
Welcome home!

2
00:00:15,278 --> 00:00:17,607
You made it! Oh, I'm so happy!

3
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:19,725
I thought you were goners for sure!

4
00:00:22,153 --> 00:00:24,875
And the rest? Lady Bishamon and the others?

5
00:00:25,224 --> 00:00:28,504
They're safe, too. They got some things out in the open.

6
00:00:29,073 --> 00:00:31,529
Hopefully, that means she'll stop hounding me.

7
00:00:32,176 --> 00:00:33,620
None of this has been easy.

8
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:39,275
But, personally, I couldn't be
happier. No more crazy war god on my tail!

9
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:44,095
And even better than that... I've
finally got myself a Blessed Vessel.

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,372
Wha?

11
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:46,134
Really?

12
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:46,452
Seriously?

13
00:00:46,477 --> 00:00:47,118
No way!

14
00:00:47,143 --> 00:00:48,467
For that wretch?

15
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:52,378
No one has ever deserved it less!

16
00:00:52,403 --> 00:00:54,499
That kid's too good for you, Yato.

17
00:00:55,354 --> 00:00:56,756
A Blessed Vessel?

18
00:00:57,303 --> 00:01:01,451
It's something pretty rare. Yukki
risked his name to protect his master.

19
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:06,035
Just like what Kazu did for
Bisha. They're very special Regalia.

20
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:15,457
So, you've finally found the one
for you. That must make you happy.

21
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,634
Kinda.

22
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:23,194
All right! We're celebratin'
tonight! Let's go prep for a party!

23
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:23,869
Woo-hoo!

24
00:01:23,894 --> 00:01:28,438
That reminds me... Uh-oh! Oh,
no! My advancement exam is today!

25
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,498
I'm sorry! I really have to go!

26
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,716
If you'd wait a moment please, Hiyori.

27
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:34,072
Yes, what is it?

28
00:01:35,424 --> 00:01:36,432
Well, Yato?

29
00:01:36,928 --> 00:01:40,758
About our agreement. I trust you remember.

30
00:03:11,631 --> 00:03:14,315
Please, Tenjin. Just take us up there.

31
00:03:15,284 --> 00:03:17,009
This is for Hiyori.

32
00:03:17,571 --> 00:03:23,347
I'll agree to help you on two conditions.
First, no one is to know I was involved in any way.

33
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:24,508
As for the second...

34
00:03:25,198 --> 00:03:27,072
I assume you know.

35
00:03:27,656 --> 00:03:32,313
Now that you've returned safely, you are
to sever your ties with her once and for all.

36
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:36,578
No...

37
00:03:37,636 --> 00:03:39,548
You actually agreed to that?

38
00:03:39,943 --> 00:03:44,291
It's become painfully obvious that Yato's
involved you too much with the Far Shore.

39
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:48,728
That entanglement has repeatedly
placed you in unnecessary danger.

40
00:03:48,943 --> 00:03:49,984
Lord Tenjin, I don't think...

41
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:51,865
You are not yet one of the dead.

42
00:03:52,845 --> 00:03:57,353
You must send her back where she belongs
now, Yato. It is the right thing to do.

43
00:03:57,963 --> 00:03:59,294
You know it is.

44
00:04:01,236 --> 00:04:02,264
Sekki.

45
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:11,153
You're going to cut our ties? Are you sure, Yato?

46
00:04:11,436 --> 00:04:16,724
I'll forget you, though. It'll be like we
never even met. And you're okay with that?

47
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:25,924
Well, I'm not. Don't do it. You
can't! It's not fair! Please! Yato!

48
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:28,530
I'm not ready to lose you yet!

49
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:44,814
I gotta say. These uniforms are a
whole lot cuter than our old ones were.

50
00:04:45,003 --> 00:04:49,970
Yeah! I wasn't sure I liked them that much
at first, but I think they're growing on me.

51
00:04:49,995 --> 00:04:54,118
You know, Hiyori, for a little while there
it looked like you weren't even gonna graduate.

52
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,017
You only barely woke up in time to take the exam.

53
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:02,035
What about you? You were wide
awake, and you still almost failed.

54
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:03,922
Yeah, I don't wanna talk about it, thanks.

55
00:05:03,947 --> 00:05:04,826
Heh.

56
00:05:05,647 --> 00:05:07,370
So, what club are you gonna join?

57
00:05:07,395 --> 00:05:09,253
I still haven't decided.

58
00:05:09,278 --> 00:05:12,573
Tennis or basketball... Or a Culture Club, maybe.

59
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:14,131
What do you think?

60
00:05:14,156 --> 00:05:15,923
Hm. I'm not really sure.

61
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,730
What'll she join? The Yato Club, of course!

62
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:20,986
What's up, Hiyori?

63
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,340
Join now and guess what? You can
get your very own fluffy-fluff scarf!

64
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:30,370
Hey, where's the fire?

65
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:32,695
Maybe she's joining the Track Club.

66
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,384
Yato Club! Yato Club! Yato Club, Yo!

67
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,015
There it is!

68
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,206
Her first Insta-Snooze in this grade!

69
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:45,628
Yo! Where you goin'? The Yato Club is looking for you!

70
00:05:45,653 --> 00:05:47,736
Will you please stop following me?

71
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:50,049
Come on, you idiot! What are we doing?

72
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:53,270
Yato Club! Yato Club! Yato Club!

73
00:05:53,295 --> 00:05:53,983
Leave me alone!

74
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:55,226
Listen to her!

75
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:58,979
If I had to guess, I'd say...
they haven't severed their ties.

76
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:03,745
Yato's hopeless. Honestly, Mayu,
I don't know why I even bother.

77
00:06:04,178 --> 00:06:06,384
What does he intend to do now?

78
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,485
My lord.

79
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:08,108
Huh?

80
00:06:08,595 --> 00:06:10,863
It's time. We must be on our way soon.

81
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:15,410
Lady Bishamon.

82
00:06:15,688 --> 00:06:19,620
God of war though you may be,
your recent actions are unacceptable.

83
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:25,371
This isn't the Month of Gods! To
have a Colloquy now? It's unheard of!

84
00:06:25,741 --> 00:06:30,847
Your corruption and its aftermath have caused
a tumult. You have shaken the very heavens.

85
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,331
How do you explain your behavior?

86
00:06:34,049 --> 00:06:38,060
The Yato god's attack was
unexpected. I admit, I responded poorly.

87
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:40,736
Do you mean the snake god? Yato-no-kami?

88
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:45,611
Certainly not! I've no part in this.
A charlatan must be using my name!

89
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:48,521
Indeed, you're right. It was not you I meant.

90
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:51,121
I speak of a nameless god without a shrine.

91
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:57,320
Oh, yes. There are some like that. Wretches
who seek to benefit from others' status.

92
00:06:57,345 --> 00:07:02,237
True. As a matter of fact, I believe a
god of poverty is using Lord Ebisu's name.

93
00:07:02,473 --> 00:07:06,978
What I would like to know is how a shrine-less
one was able to ascend here in the first place.

94
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:13,815
Never mind this nameless god. He's of
no concern. The Masked Ones are, however.

95
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:21,463
Masked Ones... Phantoms employed using Scourges.
Never before has one appeared here in Takamagahara.

96
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:25,445
What of this Kugaha who brought
them? Why did you decide to release him?

97
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,612
Indeed.

98
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:31,372
From him, we could have learned about
the conjurer who created the Masked Ones.

99
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:33,407
Perhaps I acted hastily.

100
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,344
However, you may be interested to know that I have
since learned he was not bound by the name "Kuga."

101
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,172
I presume he was the conjurer's Nora.

102
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:46,319
A Nora, you say?

103
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:51,660
You believe someone here granted
him a name. Is that your accusation?

104
00:07:51,778 --> 00:07:55,872
Nothing like that! It isn't my
intention to accuse anyone of anything.

105
00:07:56,555 --> 00:08:01,242
What troubles me is this conjurer's
ingenuity and ability to deceive the gods!

106
00:08:02,638 --> 00:08:07,066
This incident has unsettled both Heaven
and Earth. There will be consequences.

107
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:09,235
Phantom numbers will increase.

108
00:08:09,664 --> 00:08:15,690
You are to carefully observe every Phantom's behavior. I
expect timely reports regarding any Masked Ones you find.

109
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:18,472
I will issue a search notice for this Kugaha.

110
00:08:20,843 --> 00:08:22,722
The Colloquy is adjourned.

111
00:08:24,868 --> 00:08:26,493
So, she really was corrupted?

112
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:30,164
And he's still her exemplar? Even after failing her twice?

113
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,698
I'm finished. Finally.

114
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,661
You must be exhausted.

115
00:08:36,187 --> 00:08:37,773
I admit, it is fatiguing.

116
00:08:38,244 --> 00:08:43,511
I know I am at fault for what happened. But
as a god, I cannot afford to bow down to others.

117
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,464
I understand their displeasure, though.

118
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:54,371
There's no trace of Kugaha. No one knows
where he is. If he truly is a Nora, as we suspect,

119
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:56,857
he may already have returned to another master.

120
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,235
Most likely the one who created the masks.

121
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:04,024
Naming and employing Phantoms...
Who would do such a thing?

122
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:08,486
It's essentially like asking to
be corrupted. That's inconceivable.

123
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:09,439
Truly.

124
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:12,275
How could such a god continue to exist?

125
00:09:12,683 --> 00:09:17,466
Unless... the one responsible is
already something that shouldn't exist.

126
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:18,813
Bishamon!

127
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:19,261
Hm?

128
00:09:19,286 --> 00:09:21,241
Good to see ya! How's it goin'?

129
00:09:21,322 --> 00:09:23,887
Okuninushi! Everyone!

130
00:09:24,678 --> 00:09:27,501
Oh! All Seven Gods of Fortune!

131
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:29,165
Those grouchy bastards.

132
00:09:29,345 --> 00:09:34,845
Glad that's over. Thought those geezers would
never leave you alone! My ears need a break after that.

133
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:36,263
Yours, too, Inaba?

134
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:38,640
Everyone can hear you.

135
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,586
Let 'em listen! Anyway, forget all that.

136
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:46,916
Since we've got the whole gang together again, I'm
throwin' a party at my shrine in Hawaii! Wanna come?

137
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:48,902
Where's Ebisu?

138
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:53,630
He was just here a second ago. Anybody know where he went?

139
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:57,951
Ah, go figure. I don't know what
that guy's up to half the time, anyway.

140
00:09:57,976 --> 00:10:02,591
Well, drop by if you can. You know where
we'll be. It's gonna be awesome! Aloha!

141
00:10:02,616 --> 00:10:04,484
A party. Will you go?

142
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:06,412
No. I'll pass.

143
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,765
It's a pleasure to meet you.

144
00:10:10,737 --> 00:10:16,090
I'm Ebisu, of the Seven Gods of Fortune. I'm here
today because I have heard some stories about you.

145
00:10:16,694 --> 00:10:18,354
I have a proposition to make.

146
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:19,467
Iwami.

147
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:20,586
Sir.

148
00:10:22,761 --> 00:10:24,980
I would like to purchase your Blessed Vessel.

149
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,118
Is it insufficient?

150
00:10:28,636 --> 00:10:31,034
I can bring you another briefcase, master.

151
00:10:34,442 --> 00:10:35,036
Boss!

152
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:39,653
Wake up, Yato god. I want Yukine.
I am willing to pay any price.

153
00:10:39,678 --> 00:10:41,903
Uh... Any price at all?

154
00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:45,355
You're not really gonna sell
me! Even you wouldn't do that!

155
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,321
Yukine. If you do join me,
I'll pay you one million a month.

156
00:10:49,962 --> 00:10:50,647
Ow.

157
00:10:50,872 --> 00:10:54,629
I know that sting! You're feeling greedy,
aren't ya? Don't you try to hide it from me!

158
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,763
Maybe it was just a static shock.

159
00:10:56,788 --> 00:11:01,360
You are behaving distastefully, Sir Yukine.
You should not be so easily swayed by money.

160
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:03,569
It's unbecoming of an exemplar.

161
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:07,768
An exemplar? Who? Wait, me?

162
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:09,015
That's correct.

163
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,202
You are Lord Yato's unique, irreplaceable Regalia.

164
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:18,071
And that makes you the same as an
exemplar. An exemplar leads the way.

165
00:11:18,147 --> 00:11:20,595
He serves his god as a guide of virtue.

166
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:23,507
In short, he is a half-god.

167
00:11:23,904 --> 00:11:28,048
Lose your way, and your master will
surely perish. You must be steadfast.

168
00:11:28,107 --> 00:11:30,438
Indeed. Your position is vital.

169
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:32,964
It is you who protects Lord Yato's name.

170
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,247
Perhaps you could see about acquiring
the services of a different exemplar.

171
00:11:38,487 --> 00:11:40,624
Or perhaps we could share Yukine.

172
00:11:41,095 --> 00:11:43,252
I would welcome his talent, even as a Nora.

173
00:11:43,576 --> 00:11:44,556
Uh...

174
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,209
It's rather sad. A god residing in another's abode.
And surely a Blessed Vessel deserves better than that.

175
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,661
Have you no shrine of your own, Yato god?

176
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:07,859
Enough! I'm not joining the Yato Club!

177
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,401
Um, where did all of that come from?

178
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:13,755
Oh, you mean the money?

179
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:16,845
Don't tell me...?

180
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,580
What do you take me for? That stone-faced
creep, Ebisu, randomly showed up here.

181
00:12:21,678 --> 00:12:27,030
He wanted to buy Yukine from me. Told me to
take the money and build a shrine. Real nice guy.

182
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:29,033
How could you do that to him?

183
00:12:29,155 --> 00:12:32,274
I didn't sell Yukine! Have some faith in me, will ya?

184
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:36,064
I don't need somebody else's help to build my shrine.

185
00:12:37,154 --> 00:12:41,855
But, you know, it's possible Yukine
will decide he'd rather go with Ebisu.

186
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:47,805
It's a confusing time. Kid's all mixed up inside.

187
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:57,861
So, I learned something from Lord Ebisu today.

188
00:12:57,886 --> 00:12:59,993
Yeah? What was it?

189
00:13:00,094 --> 00:13:03,887
Apparently... I'm Yato's exemplar. Crazy, huh?

190
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:06,136
Not that crazy. I'm one, too.

191
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:08,495
What? You are?

192
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,407
Uh-huh.

193
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:15,563
But I thought exemplars were like, you know, leaders
and stuff. Really respectable, upstanding Regalia...

194
00:13:15,612 --> 00:13:16,722
Unlike me?

195
00:13:17,702 --> 00:13:21,837
It's true that an exemplar sets the standard
for righteousness when there are lots of Regalia.

196
00:13:21,862 --> 00:13:24,214
but I'm Kofuku's only one.

197
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:26,866
Just like you're Yato's only Regalia.

198
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,543
Right. His only one.

199
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:38,678
And remember, Kofuku's a god of poverty
who spreads disaster. She isn't helpless.

200
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:44,678
She doesn't need much protecting, so she says. My lady
is always telling me I shouldn't risk my name for her.

201
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:50,430
All I need to do is raise her when she
reincarnates. That's my duty as her exemplar.

202
00:13:51,138 --> 00:13:58,271
It's how I protect her. Now, Lord Ebisu relies on his
exemplar, Iwami, to see that his wishes are passed on.

203
00:13:58,561 --> 00:14:02,587
His reincarnations and Regalia
changes tend to be pretty intense.

204
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:06,853
And then there's Kazuma. You know
how devoted he is to Lady Bishamon.

205
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:12,629
Exemplars all have their own way of protecting
their masters. And none of them are wrong.

206
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:17,737
Question is, how do you want to protect Yato?

207
00:14:28,392 --> 00:14:31,018
So, um. What are you gonna do with the money?

208
00:14:31,043 --> 00:14:33,975
I'm gonna give it all back! What else would I do?

209
00:14:36,818 --> 00:14:42,303
Hello and thank you for calling! Fast, affordable,
and reliable. Delivery God Yato at your service!

210
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,290
So, how can I help you?

211
00:14:44,345 --> 00:14:47,093
S-Sorry, I, um...

212
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,537
Uh...

213
00:14:49,562 --> 00:14:54,830
Hey, um. I'm pretty sure this is a job offer,
but it sounds kinda dirty, if you know what I mean.

214
00:14:55,737 --> 00:15:00,345
You can't afford to be picky about work! You slacker!

215
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,761
Oh please, God! Don't hurt us!
Please, God. Please, God. Please, God.

216
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:06,764
What the...?

217
00:15:10,928 --> 00:15:14,177
The client's grandmother was
the victim of a bank transfer scam.

218
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:17,011
Wouldn't she be better off just going to the police?

219
00:15:17,095 --> 00:15:19,692
She doesn't wanna make a big deal of it, apparently.

220
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:25,609
Hey. Five yen isn't a lot of money. You
ever think about raising your rate a little bit?

221
00:15:25,728 --> 00:15:30,361
What, and stop getting clients altogether?
Forget that! I'm trying to get my name out there.

222
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:33,156
I want people who believe in me. Not money.

223
00:15:34,246 --> 00:15:36,012
A little money wouldn't hurt, though.

224
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:40,442
You, too? Typical! My Regalia are
always quitting because of money.

225
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:45,066
I don't get it. Humans seem to
be incurably fixated on the stuff.

226
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:49,095
Why should you be any different?
Go join Ebisu for all I care!

227
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,609
Oh! Now I see! With Regalia always leaving, you
don't have much choice. You have to turn to Nora.

228
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:59,274
Makes perfect sense. That's
why you haven't gotten rid of her.

229
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:03,125
You need her as your fallback. That's kinda sad, actually.

230
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:15,823
Here we go. That's the post office box the
old woman sent the money to. He's our man.

231
00:16:17,882 --> 00:16:18,651
Sekki.

232
00:16:21,743 --> 00:16:22,561
Sekki!

233
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,066
Man, old people are such suckers!

234
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:31,887
Uh. I'm not seeing a Phantom, here.

235
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,686
Yep! There it is. The size of a flea!

236
00:16:38,678 --> 00:16:40,236
We'll cut only the Phantom.

237
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,181
No good. It's too small for me to cut.

238
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,610
In that case...

239
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,480
Wait!

240
00:16:55,303 --> 00:16:57,762
Geezer. More. More.

241
00:16:58,657 --> 00:16:59,820
What was that?

242
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:01,993
I think that Phantom's got a thing for money.

243
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:03,834
Money, huh?

244
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:09,336
Yato! You've gotta revert me! Hurry!

245
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:09,954
Huh?

246
00:17:09,979 --> 00:17:12,763
Just do it! And you keep chasing the Phantom.

247
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:19,334
Back already? Is Yatty with you?

248
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:23,756
Hey, what are you doing up here?

249
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:25,602
Acting like an exemplar should.

250
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,771
Huh?

251
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,622
I can't let myself become fixated on money.

252
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:34,420
I need to remember I've got a job
to do. I can't put my desires first.

253
00:17:35,464 --> 00:17:37,027
Wait, I'm coming, too!

254
00:17:39,636 --> 00:17:40,728
So easy!

255
00:17:40,753 --> 00:17:44,486
Want more. Not enough.

256
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,678
Want a lot more.

257
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:52,551
Look! Money! It's raining money!

258
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:01,570
What the hell are you doing with my money?

259
00:18:01,841 --> 00:18:03,698
He's got a plan, right?

260
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:05,954
Money! My sweet money!

261
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,693
I don't know much about it yet, but I'd guess
an exemplar isn't supposed to give into greed.

262
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,031
How do you want to protect Yato?

263
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,165
Who will be your exemplar? If
the choice is between me, and her...

264
00:18:25,636 --> 00:18:26,868
... then it should be me.

265
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:35,581
Wow, kid, you've really changed.

266
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:40,942
Woo-hoo! Money-money-money! Gimme more!

267
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:44,301
More! More! More!

268
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:46,501
More!

269
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:48,080
More!

270
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:49,106
That's a big one!

271
00:18:49,131 --> 00:18:51,934
All right! The Phantom took the bait. Let's go!

272
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:55,028
Dude! You're still stuffing your pockets?

273
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:59,682
"Who needs money?" You act all high and mighty,
but you were gonna sell me! C'mon, admit it, you were!

274
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:03,026
I'd never sell you, I swear! I do want money, though!

275
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:04,225
So the truth comes out, huh?

276
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,858
I need money for a shrine!

277
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:08,349
Why are you so obsessed with having a shrine?

278
00:19:11,678 --> 00:19:14,330
As your exemplar, I feel I should make a suggestion.

279
00:19:15,178 --> 00:19:16,945
Throw the money away, Yato.

280
00:19:20,595 --> 00:19:22,419
Sekki! Let's go!

281
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:23,038
Yeah!

282
00:19:23,895 --> 00:19:25,613
Want more!

283
00:19:27,635 --> 00:19:28,290
Ha!

284
00:19:28,598 --> 00:19:33,519
More money! Want more money!

285
00:19:34,345 --> 00:19:42,101
This is the land of the Rising Sun. Your desecrations
shall not be allowed. Hear me. I am the god, Yato.

286
00:19:42,126 --> 00:19:49,845
I now lay thee waste with the Sekki, and
expel thy vast defilement! I cleanse thee!

287
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,204
Rend!

288
00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:52,714
More money!

289
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:08,641
A bank transfer scam? How awful! Be careful,
Hiyori. You never know who you can trust these days.

290
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:09,752
Yeah.

291
00:20:10,237 --> 00:20:13,803
Money is nice, but as they say, it can't buy happiness.

292
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:18,134
Ah. I need to go take a look in my brother's room.

293
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:23,554
Well done! I hear you turned
down Ebi's offer. I'm proud of you.

294
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,985
This kid's really startin' to grow up on us.

295
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,836
Way to go, Yukine!

296
00:20:28,723 --> 00:20:30,695
So... where's Yato?

297
00:20:34,195 --> 00:20:38,903
He really wanted a shrine. He's pretty bummed
out about it. This is some hardcore pouting.

298
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:41,802
You know he's really upset when he refuses to eat.

299
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:47,300
Yato, is a shrine really that important?

300
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:53,521
Yeah, it is. If you don't have one, it's
like no one cares about you or anything you do.

301
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,777
All right, then.

302
00:20:59,938 --> 00:21:02,260
Here. This is for you.

303
00:21:03,477 --> 00:21:04,236
Whoa.

304
00:21:04,344 --> 00:21:05,486
A mini shrine?

305
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:06,861
You made it, Yori?

306
00:21:06,886 --> 00:21:07,844
That's right!

307
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:13,930
I used my brother's materials. I actually had a
lot of fun doing it. I was up working all night.

308
00:21:14,184 --> 00:21:15,225
Wow!

309
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,504
Hey, this is awesome! You finally got yourself a shrine.

310
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:20,231
I hope it'll cheer you up.

311
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,483
He-He's crying?

312
00:21:28,116 --> 00:21:30,599
Why are you so obsessed with having a shrine?

313
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,474
It's my dream, okay?

314
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:41,062
I've always wanted one. Ever since I was
little. But no one would ever build one for me.

315
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:48,618
Humans may not think much about it, but
being given a shrine is a very big honor for us.

316
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:53,233
Because there're people who believe
in us. People who appreciate us.

317
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:56,658
For a god, not much matters more than that.

318
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:09,758
Hey, man, watch the snot! Tissues! We need tissues!
Aw, geez! You're gonna get snot all over your new shrine!

319
00:22:19,886 --> 00:22:23,695
So, the Yato god can't be persuaded
to let go of his Blessed Vessel. Hmph.

320
00:23:55,237 --> 00:23:57,618
Ebisu! Join me for a drink tonight!

321
00:23:57,643 --> 00:24:00,286
Very well. What time would
you like to meet for this drink?

322
00:24:00,311 --> 00:24:01,674
You know, whenever.

323
00:24:01,699 --> 00:24:07,666
On the next Noragami Aragoto: "God of Calamity." And how
big is this drink? If there are two of us, it must be...

324
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:09,691
I don't think you get the concept.
