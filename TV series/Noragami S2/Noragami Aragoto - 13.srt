1
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:28,408
Excuse me, Mr. Yato, the light is green.

2
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,818
Will we be there soon?

3
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:46,673
Hey, it looks like your shoelace is untied.

4
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:51,070
I've tried very hard, but it's
difficult for me to tie them.

5
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:10,598
Welcome! Come in, have a seat!

6
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:18,282
Anything in here sound good to you, Ebisu?

7
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:56,402
Well, Yato made it back. Finally.

8
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,748
Yeah.

9
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,167
It was nice of Lady Bishamon to give him a
room to recover in. Though I'm kind of surprised.

10
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:04,424
Yeah.

11
00:03:05,572 --> 00:03:07,655
And Kofuku gave him all those snacks.

12
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:10,011
He'll be well fed while he heals, at least.

13
00:03:10,614 --> 00:03:11,366
Yeah.

14
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:15,541
I just hope he'll be okay. You know?

15
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:18,784
Me, too.

16
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:23,409
But, I wish I could help somehow.

17
00:03:26,822 --> 00:03:27,446
Huh?

18
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,755
Yukine!

19
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:39,278
What is it? Is something wrong?

20
00:03:41,197 --> 00:03:42,642
Have you seen Yato recently?

21
00:03:43,447 --> 00:03:46,101
Ebisu came to visit Yato, but now they're gone.

22
00:03:46,447 --> 00:03:48,714
The room is empty, and we have no sign of them.

23
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,317
And, my room had been ransacked.

24
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,512
That was them!

25
00:04:03,447 --> 00:04:05,116
So this is the Olive Tavern?

26
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:07,638
Feel free to order whatever you want.

27
00:04:07,884 --> 00:04:10,693
I mean it, go nuts. It's Kazuma's treat today.

28
00:04:11,364 --> 00:04:13,348
Well, dear, what can I get for you?

29
00:04:13,957 --> 00:04:15,401
Looks like they have a kids' meal.

30
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:17,989
How's that sound? Even comes with a toy.

31
00:04:18,072 --> 00:04:19,037
No, thank you.

32
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,456
I'd like a simmered Hamburg steak.

33
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:23,326
Well, what do ya know?

34
00:04:23,655 --> 00:04:25,530
I had a feeling that's what you'd ask for.

35
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:28,584
You look just like another
gentleman who gets that all the time!

36
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:31,932
He must be your daddy! Like father, like son, eh?

37
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:48,632
Rend!

38
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,033
He cut through it? Impossible!

39
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,849
That was incredible! Yato god!

40
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:21,147
He truly is fearless. And so is his Blessed Vessel.

41
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,485
Damn monkey suit.

42
00:05:24,645 --> 00:05:26,619
How does Kazuma stand this thing?

43
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:28,357
Feels like I'm suffocating.

44
00:05:28,905 --> 00:05:32,574
If you don't mind me asking, sir, is
there a particular reason you brought me here?

45
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:37,777
Because it was Ebisu's wish.

46
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:39,707
You mean my last self?

47
00:05:40,124 --> 00:05:42,338
Were you friends with my previous incarnation?

48
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:46,233
Your last self, huh?

49
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,043
Veena, look!

50
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,615
No! Run, Ebisu!

51
00:06:07,072 --> 00:06:08,886
You really did reincarnate.

52
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,614
Yes. From what I've been told, plenty of gods
reincarnate, though none do it as frequently as I do.

53
00:06:14,697 --> 00:06:15,822
The previous Ebisus

54
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:18,361
I don't care about previous Ebisus.

55
00:06:19,114 --> 00:06:22,653
Far as I'm concerned, there's
only one, and he's gone for good now.

56
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:27,989
Well, all righty! Here we are!

57
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:30,280
Good choice! That looks tasty.

58
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:31,753
Thank you for this food.

59
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,905
It's really yummy!

60
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:44,121
Oh, yeah? How yummy?

61
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:45,953
Does it bring back memories?

62
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:49,501
Hey! I'm talking to you, kid. Well?

63
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,166
Geez.

64
00:06:59,906 --> 00:07:01,531
This really is incredible.

65
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,537
I have never tasted anything so delicious before!

66
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:10,324
That's not exactly true. From what you had told
me, it sounded like you seriously liked the food here.

67
00:07:10,572 --> 00:07:12,182
Well, this me likes it, too.

68
00:07:13,697 --> 00:07:15,998
Reincarnation doesn't change everything, huh?

69
00:07:16,614 --> 00:07:19,079
You're still as clumsy as ever, that's for sure.

70
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:24,332
So, kid. You really don't remember anything?

71
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:25,222
Nothing.

72
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:27,757
Not the fight we had in the underworld?

73
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,575
Or our mad dash to escape Izanami?

74
00:07:31,822 --> 00:07:34,236
No, but did I really fight you, Mr. Yato?

75
00:07:37,354 --> 00:07:39,764
I guess memories aren't passed down at all, huh?

76
00:07:43,327 --> 00:07:44,418
I don't know.

77
00:07:45,655 --> 00:07:47,432
I was just suddenly here.

78
00:07:48,564 --> 00:07:54,951
From the shrine I could see the beautiful sea and a
quiet, peaceful town full of people who were hard at work.

79
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,193
I fell in love with this incredible world at first sight.

80
00:08:00,322 --> 00:08:03,453
I knew right away that I wanted
to make the people here happy.

81
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:07,515
A strong desire to make everybody happy.

82
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:10,743
That must be the natural instinct of the Ebisu god.

83
00:08:10,905 --> 00:08:13,436
What do you mean? Aren't all gods like that?

84
00:08:15,655 --> 00:08:17,575
Wow, good question.

85
00:08:17,905 --> 00:08:20,916
So you're a war god, aren't
you Mr. Yato? What's that like?

86
00:08:21,036 --> 00:08:23,033
I bet you must be a really good fighter.

87
00:08:23,362 --> 00:08:26,405
Yeah, I am. Seems to be all I'm good at.

88
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:30,543
That's so cool! I'm really
clumsy. I bet I'd be bad at fighting.

89
00:08:30,822 --> 00:08:32,887
Did I at least do okay in the underworld?

90
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:37,239
Remember? You said that you and I fought one time.

91
00:08:37,322 --> 00:08:39,448
Fighting a war god, I can't believe it!

92
00:08:39,676 --> 00:08:42,292
And what about my Regalia? Was I good friends with them?

93
00:08:42,947 --> 00:08:45,214
Was I the kind of god that made people happy?

94
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:49,354
I hope so! But maybe I wasn't.

95
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,076
Everyone says the heavens executed me.

96
00:08:56,072 --> 00:08:59,579
So, I guess I must've been a
pretty bad guy if that happened.

97
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:01,637
That isn't true!

98
00:09:02,662 --> 00:09:04,205
You were a righteous man!

99
00:09:04,989 --> 00:09:09,574
You were willing to sacrifice your life
for the sakes of others! And your strength...

100
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:13,701
It was unbelievable. I don't even begin to compare to you!

101
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:15,253
But still, you...

102
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,990
Revert, Kuni!

103
00:09:41,697 --> 00:09:42,635
Ebisu!

104
00:09:48,405 --> 00:09:50,039
Hang in there. Okay?

105
00:09:50,405 --> 00:09:52,390
Come on! Ebisu!

106
00:09:53,374 --> 00:09:55,601
Farewell, Conjurer Ebisu.

107
00:09:56,072 --> 00:10:01,211
Hopefully your new overseer will ensure that
you behave with more discretion in your next life.

108
00:10:02,114 --> 00:10:04,082
May you now decease without worry.

109
00:10:09,697 --> 00:10:11,895
Don't you die! Ya hear?

110
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:14,364
Don't you dare die on me, Ebisu!

111
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:25,655
It's all right.

112
00:10:25,739 --> 00:10:28,155
You are very famous, Lord Ebisu.

113
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:30,864
A god like you will always be reborn.

114
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:33,582
See? There's no reason to be scared.

115
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:36,497
Don't worry. It's okay to die.

116
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:40,572
Ebisu! Come on, stay strong, man!

117
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:44,807
What about you as an individual.

118
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,771
Is dying here really what you want?

119
00:10:51,822 --> 00:10:53,434
What this you wants?

120
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:02,280
Ya-Yato god.

121
00:11:02,364 --> 00:11:06,452
I consider myself lucky to have met you.

122
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:11,484
Ebisu. I'm the lucky one.

123
00:11:12,947 --> 00:11:16,170
No, please! I don't want to die!

124
00:11:27,697 --> 00:11:33,103
But you did. And I couldn't stop it. I'm sorry!

125
00:11:34,114 --> 00:11:37,072
Uh, but, Mr. Yato, what happened wasn't your fault.

126
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,031
Please.

127
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:42,099
Let me apologize.

128
00:11:59,072 --> 00:12:01,796
As you may know, the heavens issued an official sanction.

129
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:05,975
Along with my reincarnation,
my exemplar Iwami was expelled.

130
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:10,236
In exchange, they were willing to
leave the rest of the Mi Clan unpunished.

131
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,614
So I thought about it.

132
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:15,459
And have I decided to make Kunimi my new overseer.

133
00:12:17,197 --> 00:12:19,614
I don't want anything bad to happen to Iwami.

134
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,453
He's been with me for a long time.

135
00:12:21,989 --> 00:12:24,864
Thanks to all your help, the heavens
haven't been able to find him yet.

136
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:27,056
I would like to keep it that way, if possible.

137
00:12:27,322 --> 00:12:32,745
In order to do so, I think it would be best for
him to remain here. If that's acceptable to you.

138
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:33,980
It is.

139
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:36,276
Thank you so much, Ms. Crazy Chick!

140
00:12:37,864 --> 00:12:41,041
That name. Where did you hear it, Ebisu?

141
00:12:42,114 --> 00:12:44,489
Oh, is it wrong? I learned it from Mr. Yato.

142
00:12:44,572 --> 00:12:47,166
I thought it was weird, but he said it was your real name.

143
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:48,337
Did he?

144
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:51,498
You must be curious.

145
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:53,561
Allow me to recount the facts for you.

146
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,739
The young master entered Izanami's realm in
order to find an underworld Locution Brush.

147
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,177
What does such a thing do?

148
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,845
It gives one the ability to name and employ Phantoms.

149
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,822
Over many incarnations, he
studied methods of controlling them.

150
00:13:09,992 --> 00:13:12,351
He was very thorough and dedicated to his work.

151
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:17,621
But he was never able to achieve satisfactory results.

152
00:13:19,306 --> 00:13:21,905
So that's why he was gettin' so sick all the time.

153
00:13:21,989 --> 00:13:24,697
And this Locution Brush. Does he have it now?

154
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,650
Actually, it's gone missing.

155
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:28,847
I am certain he brought it back with him, though.

156
00:13:31,072 --> 00:13:34,418
To be honest, if I had my way, it would stay missing.

157
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,455
I hope he never touches that damn thing again.

158
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:42,126
Look, what I don't get, is why he was so
obsessed with using Phantoms in the first place.

159
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:46,958
As you are all aware, the young
master is a god of commerce.

160
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:53,512
But inevitably, his incarnations realize that
wealth alone is not enough to bring people happiness,

161
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:58,863
and so he eventually becomes obsessed with
conjurers and the power to control Phantoms.

162
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:04,933
He convinces himself that he can curb disaster
and use Phantoms for the benefit of humanity.

163
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:07,597
This is news to us.

164
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,718
All this time, and we had no idea what he was up to.

165
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:13,685
He only wanted to help people.

166
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,489
Could we have prevented his death?

167
00:14:16,572 --> 00:14:19,473
Things could have turned out
quite differently had we known more.

168
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:21,709
Yeah, maybe.

169
00:14:22,974 --> 00:14:27,554
I'm sure the desire to help humanity will be
passed on to the newest young master as well.

170
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:37,438
Yato's at it again, sponging off us
and actin' like he owns the place. Tch.

171
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,530
He just sits around all damn day.

172
00:14:39,614 --> 00:14:41,238
We're not running a charity here.

173
00:14:41,487 --> 00:14:44,627
Would it kill him to wash dishes or fold laundry sometime?

174
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,989
If he did some chores, it might
help him work up an appetite.

175
00:14:48,072 --> 00:14:51,370
We make him all that food and it
just goes to waste while he pines away.

176
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:55,489
These complaints, coming from you?

177
00:14:55,572 --> 00:15:00,288
The man who swept the attic every day Yatty was
gone so it would be ready for him when he came back?

178
00:15:01,486 --> 00:15:04,903
Admit it, you big softy. You missed him. Right?

179
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:10,570
I understand. I want him to get better, too.

180
00:15:12,822 --> 00:15:15,399
He'll have help. He's got Yukine and Hiyori.

181
00:15:15,947 --> 00:15:17,502
You're right, he does.

182
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:19,926
I'm sure the three of them will be fine.

183
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,605
Yukine. Come with me.

184
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:42,088
I recognize that smell.

185
00:15:50,665 --> 00:15:53,595
Well, out with it. If you've gotta talk, then talk.

186
00:15:55,697 --> 00:15:56,834
Okay then.

187
00:15:57,989 --> 00:16:03,269
From the time I was little, I used
Nora to kill people. So many people.

188
00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:05,476
That's in the past.

189
00:16:06,114 --> 00:16:11,405
No, I kill people. It's what I've
always done whenever I was told to.

190
00:16:11,489 --> 00:16:12,812
Even just recently.

191
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,706
Disgusting, huh? But I really want it to stop.

192
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,041
I don't want that to be me anymore.

193
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,864
You have the determination that marks a good god.

194
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,383
The kind of god that can make people happy.

195
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:36,698
I keep asking myself: "What can I do?

196
00:16:37,405 --> 00:16:39,005
How can I be like Ebisu?"

197
00:16:58,447 --> 00:16:59,471
Nora.

198
00:17:00,072 --> 00:17:03,966
You're terrible, Yato. Leaving me behind like that.

199
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:06,924
But I suppose I can forgive you.

200
00:17:07,114 --> 00:17:09,074
You completed your task, after all.

201
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,686
You rescued Ebisu from the
underworld like you were told to.

202
00:17:14,072 --> 00:17:15,334
Tell me something.

203
00:17:16,572 --> 00:17:17,734
Was it a set-up?

204
00:17:18,072 --> 00:17:20,306
Was Ebisu killed in place of my old man?

205
00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:23,924
Are you only now figuring that out?

206
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:28,136
The heavens were relentlessly
investigating their conjurer.

207
00:17:28,287 --> 00:17:30,258
Someone needed to take the fall.

208
00:17:30,655 --> 00:17:36,405
Ebisu happened to share an interest in
controlling Phantoms, so he was the perfect choice.

209
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:41,800
All it took was one tiny little nudge from
Father, and the heavens sprang into action.

210
00:17:41,989 --> 00:17:44,655
They got their conjurer, and he got to live.

211
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:46,360
A happy ending for all!

212
00:17:48,682 --> 00:17:50,889
Now, come. Let's go home, Yato.

213
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:53,474
Father will be so proud of you.

214
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,816
Like hell he's going with you!

215
00:17:56,364 --> 00:18:01,468
Are you still here? I don't see why.
This doesn't concern weaklings like you.

216
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,955
Say. Do you know the sounds a human body makes as it dies?

217
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,155
Do you know the color blood turns when it dries?

218
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:13,982
The smell of flesh as it grows colder and harder?

219
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:16,841
The feel of bones as they're crunched beneath a blade?

220
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,370
Don't you see? You don't have
what it takes to carry Yato's burden.

221
00:18:23,322 --> 00:18:24,487
Y'know something?

222
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,457
This is how you've always been.

223
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:29,279
You never change.

224
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,027
You always smile just like that.

225
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:35,694
No matter who weeps or who dies.

226
00:18:36,572 --> 00:18:37,812
But I've changed.

227
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:39,910
I can't smile with you anymore.

228
00:18:40,947 --> 00:18:41,706
Hiki.

229
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,800
I have a new purpose now.

230
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:49,718
Thanks for everything, Hiiro.

231
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,015
You can't be serious.

232
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,287
We've always been together. We belong together.

233
00:18:58,739 --> 00:18:59,918
Yaboku!

234
00:19:04,804 --> 00:19:07,604
Not anymore. I am Yato now.

235
00:19:07,864 --> 00:19:12,723
We're done, Hiki. I hereby... release you!

236
00:19:31,322 --> 00:19:34,286
A new purpose? What is it?

237
00:19:36,322 --> 00:19:37,093
Yukine.

238
00:19:39,072 --> 00:19:41,627
I meant it. I wanna change.

239
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,468
I wanna be a different god, one who makes people happy.

240
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,477
But killing is the only thing I'm any good at.

241
00:19:50,074 --> 00:19:54,297
Tell me, what can I do? Be my guide! I need you!

242
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:02,252
Well, I don't think you need
to do anything different, really.

243
00:20:03,447 --> 00:20:07,295
If all you can do is kill,
slay disaster before it strikes.

244
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,881
I'm here for you. I am your exemplar.

245
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,273
I won't let you become a murderer again.

246
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:20,722
It's Hiyori.

247
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,780
I wish for Yato to succeed.

248
00:20:23,864 --> 00:20:25,697
May he become what he wants to be.

249
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,837
Yato, you chose Yukine.

250
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:36,978
And, Yukine, you chose Yato.

251
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:40,432
So I'm sure my wish will come true.

252
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:44,581
And if you're not... I have enough faith for all of us!

253
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:47,731
Yato!

254
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,655
That Storm's huge!

255
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:54,938
Come, Sekki!

256
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,819
By killing Phantoms, you can save the
people who would become their victims.

257
00:21:06,072 --> 00:21:08,523
And you can keep others from going astray.

258
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,614
I'm certain of it.

259
00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:15,925
So, Yato, your job is to find disaster and slay it!

260
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:19,322
This is the land of the Rising Sun.

261
00:21:19,614 --> 00:21:22,289
Your desecrations shall not be allowed.

262
00:21:22,655 --> 00:21:25,019
Hear me. I am the god, Yato.

263
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,553
I now lay thee waste with the Sekki,

264
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,197
and expel thy vast defilement!

265
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,135
I cleanse thee!

266
00:21:33,572 --> 00:21:34,708
Rend!

267
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,447
I never knew you had such a way with words, kid.

268
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:13,280
Oh, shut up. Just do your job right, okay?

269
00:23:13,364 --> 00:23:15,239
Sure thing, O' Wise Exemplar!

270
00:23:15,322 --> 00:23:16,849
I don't need your attitude!

271
00:23:19,864 --> 00:23:21,247
I'm back, Father.

272
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:24,883
So, that weakling actually released you, Mizuchi.

273
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:29,114
Looks like he's hit his rebellious stage.

274
00:23:29,197 --> 00:23:31,213
Well, isn't that just adorable?

275
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:33,868
Fujisaki, you ready?

276
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:35,094
Yeah!

277
00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:37,904
What was so interesting?

278
00:23:38,572 --> 00:23:39,157
Hm?

279
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,924
Nothing, really.
