1
00:00:07,489 --> 00:00:08,512
Where are we?

2
00:00:08,932 --> 00:00:12,818
I wish I knew. We were knocked
out. I didn't see how we got here.

3
00:00:12,843 --> 00:00:16,389
And we're trapped. The door's
been scourged from the outside.

4
00:00:16,763 --> 00:00:18,647
This sounds like a classic kidnapping!

5
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:19,917
Uh, yes.

6
00:00:19,994 --> 00:00:22,572
I've been trying to free us, but nothing's worked.

7
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:32,426
The kidnappers made one serious oversight. Those
fools. They should have known better than to kidnap me!

8
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:37,145
Let's go! Jungle Savate!

9
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:45,311
Are... you okay?

10
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:48,643
And I've got my advancement exam tomorrow!

11
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:53,951
I'm sorry. You should never have been dragged into this.

12
00:00:54,098 --> 00:00:57,579
It's okay... Really.

13
00:00:58,213 --> 00:01:02,060
I hope Yato's all right, though.
He was in pretty bad shape.

14
00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:05,468
Knowing him, he'll go and push himself too hard.

15
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,988
At this point, you should really
be more concerned about yourself.

16
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:09,918
Hm?

17
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:13,767
This is serious. We're both sealed off from the outside.

18
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:18,211
You can't remain this way for too long... or you'll die.

19
00:02:50,874 --> 00:02:53,414
What happened? Did she faint again?

20
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:57,765
Try to stay calm, dear. She isn't
hurt anywhere. She's just asleep.

21
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,445
But look at her!

22
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,820
She's probably worn out from studying.
Why don't you stay here with her?

23
00:03:04,797 --> 00:03:09,834
She's breathing shallower than I'd like.
To be safe, let's prep an oxygen ventilator.

24
00:03:11,182 --> 00:03:16,062
God, I beg you, let her be okay. Let her come back to us.

25
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:31,625
I'm really going to die here? No. I can't.

26
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:34,702
It's my fault. I should have prevented this.

27
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:41,572
But still. What happened there? Kugaha
clearly had his sights set on you. But, why?

28
00:03:42,748 --> 00:03:47,825
Plus, my invocation had no effect on him. I
shackled him with the "Kuga" name, and yet...

29
00:03:48,844 --> 00:03:50,964
Shackled him with a name?

30
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:51,853
Yes.

31
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:57,557
For Regalia, a name is a bestowment
and a scourge from the god we call master.

32
00:03:57,983 --> 00:04:02,186
Both things at once, in simpler
terms, it's a gift and a curse.

33
00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:05,580
Even for you? Your name... is a curse?

34
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:06,246
Yes.

35
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:11,853
Names dwell within those to whom they
refer. Invocations are based on that fact.

36
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:16,394
Yet, when I invoked his name, Kugaha remained unaffected.

37
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:19,376
Could it be? Is he...?

38
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:20,409
Eh?

39
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,477
No. I can't know that. All that's
certain is that he's betrayed Veena.

40
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:33,473
Using their names to employ Phantoms and scourged weapons,
Kugaha and Aiha have defiled their god-given gifts!

41
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:39,035
How could they? Names are so precious to us!

42
00:04:39,682 --> 00:04:43,841
Kazu-ma. Why are you the only
one whose name ends differently?

43
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:51,389
Kugaha, Aiha, Suzuha... Their names all
end in "ha." Why does yours end in "ma"?

44
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:59,596
It's something a lot of the gods do. They'll add
a common character to all their Regalia's names.

45
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,539
For some, it's like a brand of sorts. For
others, it is a way to foster a familial bond.

46
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:10,601
Veena currently unifies her
Regalia under the "Ha" Clan name.

47
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,984
"Currently"?

48
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,709
Yes. The previous clan shared the "Ma" name.

49
00:05:16,932 --> 00:05:21,254
I'm the sole survivor of that
clan. The "ma" in Kazuma is a relic.

50
00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:24,258
What? What happened to all the rest?

51
00:05:24,732 --> 00:05:26,125
They were annihilated.

52
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,945
Yato slaughtered the entire clan.

53
00:05:32,877 --> 00:05:41,030
Yato. If you want Kazuma, you can have him. Go ahead
and make him a Nora. May he betray you as he did me.

54
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:47,902
When next we meet, I will eradicate your name.
Not even a shred of a memory will remain of you.

55
00:05:49,403 --> 00:05:55,092
What? Bishamon took Hiyori? But, why?
That's crazy! What would Bishamon want with her?

56
00:05:56,527 --> 00:05:58,817
How could you let this happen, Yato?

57
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,857
It's my fault.

58
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:08,423
Never mind that. Let's go kick some ass.

59
00:06:10,194 --> 00:06:10,926
Yeah!

60
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,095
Wha... Hey!

61
00:06:13,675 --> 00:06:19,162
Hold on! You're not planning to assault Bishamon's
headquarters by yourselves, are you? That's crazy!

62
00:06:19,299 --> 00:06:23,064
You've been smart enough to stay
away from her. Don't change that now!

63
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:29,673
You know what happens to anyone who messes with that
chick! How do you even plan to get to Takamagahara, huh?

64
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:31,566
Do you hear me?

65
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:35,198
Yato was very thorough.

66
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,082
The destruction was total. We lost our family.

67
00:06:40,552 --> 00:06:43,016
Only Veena and I survived the massacre.

68
00:06:44,427 --> 00:06:48,435
She wept for their loss, and
fell gravely ill for a long time.

69
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:55,306
Eventually, her sorrow changed into hatred
for Yato and she obtained a new Regalia.

70
00:06:55,635 --> 00:07:01,511
Then another and another. She gave them
the "Ha" name. They're her family now.

71
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:09,177
So great is her guilt for the "Ma" Clan's death, she
now makes any spirit she comes across into a Regalia.

72
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:16,171
Among all the gods in existence, only a very
few are capable of shouldering so many of us.

73
00:07:17,457 --> 00:07:23,439
It takes immense strength and determination
to endure the pain of bearing even one Regalia.

74
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:26,881
That is what makes her the mightiest god of war.

75
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,971
And probably the one with the kindest heart, as well.

76
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:34,937
I do like that about her, but it also makes me worry.

77
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:39,179
I can't help but fear that, someday,
her kindness might be her undoing.

78
00:07:40,265 --> 00:07:42,841
We can't allow a repeat of that tragedy.

79
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,687
But she's now beset by poor health and her
Regalia's betrayal. It's almost like before!

80
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,932
If nothing changes, then soon, Veena will...

81
00:07:56,093 --> 00:08:00,751
Wait. Is that what Kugaha is after? Succession?

82
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:07,984
I don't understand! Did the plan change at some
point? I thought we were just capturing the girl.

83
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:09,552
Why'd we take Kazuma, too?

84
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:11,990
Because, he is a traitor to his kin.

85
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,932
Besides, he might be able to tell us Lady
Bishamon's weaknesses. And that could be very helpful.

86
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,436
What?! You're not making any sense!

87
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:25,346
There, do you see? Using that
staff made a bunch more grow!

88
00:08:26,103 --> 00:08:28,803
I can't go anywhere like this! People will see them!

89
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:33,268
You know, you're as gullible as you are pretty.

90
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:38,568
You're my creature now. If you want
this to stay secret, you'll do as I say.

91
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:44,675
Now, you could have an ablution done. Of course, if you
did that, there's no doubt you would be exiled for good.

92
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:50,609
Lady Bishamon will be replaced soon enough.
Until then, just take some more of these.

93
00:08:52,524 --> 00:08:53,605
Todays' dose.

94
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,218
What? Something's going to happen to our master?

95
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:57,634
You catch on quickly.

96
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:03,967
Yes, a successor is going to take her
place. But first, she's going to have to die.

97
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:11,472
Gods are born from wishes. Because of that,
gods with a name are immortal, in a sense.

98
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:14,281
A god's death won't change people's faith.

99
00:09:14,647 --> 00:09:20,601
The name of Bishamon will remain. And if
people still pray to it, a new god will be born.

100
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:24,424
There will be a new Bishamon.

101
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:27,635
The time is ripe for a successor.

102
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:31,468
And when our new master arrives.

103
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:35,251
I'll be standing by to take
Kazuma's place as exemplar

104
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:39,588
with the absolute power of a
mighty war god at my fingertips.

105
00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:41,317
That's horrible.

106
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:45,463
But Bishamon's so powerful, how can he possibly kill her?

107
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:52,281
If you don't return, Yato will think Veena abducted
you. He'll come to your rescue, and he'll be very angry.

108
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:52,787
Huh?

109
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:56,784
Yes. Kugaha can't do it himself.

110
00:09:57,259 --> 00:09:59,294
He plans to have Yato kill her.

111
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:02,458
No! That's absolutely unforgivable! I won't...

112
00:10:04,432 --> 00:10:08,536
Stop talking. Unless becoming a
monster is what you actually want.

113
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:13,526
Damn it! Where is Kazuma, now that we actually need him?

114
00:10:14,637 --> 00:10:17,757
You'll have to use me to stop Yato. C'mon, let's go!

115
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:19,880
Kofuku!

116
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:25,615
If we did that, the Storm we'd cause would
be huge. Do you know how many people would die?

117
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,332
But what should we do?

118
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:29,517
Those two may well kill each other.

119
00:10:29,698 --> 00:10:34,908
Bishamon would be reborn right away,
but Yato's got no name, and there's Yukine!

120
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,125
Let's make a bet!

121
00:10:36,624 --> 00:10:40,555
The odds against Yatty winning
are ten to one. So I'll bet on Bisha!

122
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,010
Gambling? Now isn't the time for...

123
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:50,953
That's right. Think about it for a second! I'm the god
of poverty. If I bet money on Bisha, then she should lose.

124
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:53,424
Which means Yatty should win, right?

125
00:10:56,066 --> 00:10:59,495
Certainly not! You know that I don't have a shrine.

126
00:10:59,874 --> 00:11:02,641
Without one, I can't get to Takamagahara on my own.

127
00:11:03,182 --> 00:11:05,851
Please, Tenjin. Just take us up there.

128
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:07,932
For Hiyori.

129
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:15,234
This sort of thing is exactly the reason you
shouldn't be keeping her tied to the Far Shore.

130
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:22,976
I'll agree to help you on two conditions.
First, no one is to know I was involved in any way.

131
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:27,257
As for the second... I assume you know.

132
00:11:28,957 --> 00:11:29,727
Yeah.

133
00:11:30,765 --> 00:11:33,072
Yato. Yukine.

134
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:43,606
It seems strange. Bishamon has always been such a noble
god. Not the sort who would stoop to kidnapping a girl.

135
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,346
What is it? Are you worried?

136
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:52,902
Well, a little. He is obstinate, though.
Once he gets going, not much can stop him.

137
00:11:52,927 --> 00:11:59,115
They'll be just fine. I'm sure. Still,
this is going to be one stormy night.

138
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:01,755
It certainly will be.

139
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:08,452
And the plum blossoms are in full bloom.
I do hope they survive the disturbance.

140
00:12:14,173 --> 00:12:15,528
Let's go, Sekki!

141
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,050
What's that?

142
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:34,533
Intruder at the front gate!

143
00:12:34,558 --> 00:12:35,139
Run!

144
00:12:35,164 --> 00:12:37,073
All non-weapons, get inside!

145
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:37,871
Who goes there?

146
00:12:37,896 --> 00:12:39,355
Alert the master!

147
00:12:42,098 --> 00:12:47,741
I never expected you to come to me.
I've been wanting to see you, Yato.

148
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:49,822
It looks like you got your wish.

149
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:52,594
Not yet, but soon enough.

150
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,056
Gaiki! Suki!

151
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,396
I want you at maximum firepower!

152
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:09,636
Feel that? Those two Regalia seem extra
powerful! They're way beyond normal handguns.

153
00:13:10,635 --> 00:13:13,917
With Kazuma gone, there's nobody
to keep this crazy woman in check!

154
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:16,906
But that doesn't matter if she can't hit us!

155
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:24,882
I'm her exemplar! I should have seen this coming.
He's set two gods against each other. It's unthinkable!

156
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:32,773
Don't do it, Veena! You can't face
Yato! You're playing into Kugaha's hands!

157
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:34,924
I'm glad you came, Yato god.

158
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:40,604
I've sickened Bishamon for you. I think
you'll find her much weaker than you expected.

159
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:48,576
Considering how graciously I've prepared everything, I
think it's only fair you do your part and kill Bishamon!

160
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:53,382
This is awful!

161
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:54,900
There you are!

162
00:13:56,909 --> 00:14:02,948
Oh, awesome! I'm glad you're already standing
by! This is a big one! We're up against Lord Yato.

163
00:14:03,115 --> 00:14:08,303
You're more experienced, so we're holding you
in reserve. If I go down, it'll all be up to you.

164
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,682
Milady, I'm coming!

165
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:14,457
Come! Kinki! Shoki! Jinki! Shuki!

166
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,495
What the hell? Why'd you go dull all of a sudden?

167
00:14:35,588 --> 00:14:37,519
Sorry, I can't help it.

168
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:43,535
Her whip, her lion, her outfit... They're
all Regalia like me. How can I kill them?

169
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:47,724
They don't share your reservations,
you know. They're trying to kill us.

170
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:50,057
Yeah, I know that, but still.

171
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,948
Maybe if I put it another way.

172
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,554
Protect me!

173
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:56,810
We came here to get Hiyori back!

174
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:00,878
All right.

175
00:15:01,137 --> 00:15:02,340
Let's go!

176
00:15:03,038 --> 00:15:04,240
Suki! Gaiki!

177
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,594
Don't flinch! Blast him and his Regalia to bits for me!

178
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,489
Karuha!

179
00:15:16,738 --> 00:15:18,539
Tell me where Hiyori is!

180
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:20,834
What? How should I know?

181
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:27,004
That's one tough Garment for how
little it covers. Don't play dumb, coward!

182
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:29,416
You dragged an innocent person into this!

183
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:34,629
You act so righteous. You, who
slaughtered my entire family!

184
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:38,688
Tell me! Why did you kill them, Yato?

185
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,596
What I'm wondering is why I just didn't kill you, too!

186
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:45,745
Why would he do something like that?

187
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,937
Because of me.

188
00:15:48,103 --> 00:15:48,643
Huh?

189
00:15:49,092 --> 00:15:50,685
Because I asked him to do it.

190
00:15:51,787 --> 00:15:54,822
I asked Yato to murder my clan.

191
00:15:57,855 --> 00:16:02,539
As is natural for a war god,
Veena has always kept many Regalia.

192
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:04,282
Now. Come, Choki.

193
00:16:04,307 --> 00:16:05,716
Uh. Yes, Lady.

194
00:16:08,058 --> 00:16:11,142
As a fledgling Regalia, I was just a simple nail.

195
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:14,648
I wonder what that portends,
his impaling our master's body.

196
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,673
This isn't an ill omen of things to come, I hope.

197
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:24,458
Don't judge too swiftly. It could be a sign that he
will always serve me soundly. Let's go easy on him.

198
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:27,080
We have all the time in the world, after all.

199
00:16:27,723 --> 00:16:30,576
I will serve you soundly. I'll make you proud.

200
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:36,789
She won me over easily with her kindness. I
was determined to live up to her expectations.

201
00:16:37,848 --> 00:16:39,865
Borderline! Borderline!

202
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:44,311
Pathetic! Keep going like that, and
you'll never be any use to the master.

203
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:47,147
Borderline!

204
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,557
And then, one day.

205
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:53,885
This is terrible! Our master has been befouled!

206
00:16:55,006 --> 00:16:58,823
Who is responsible? You'll pay
dearly for this when I find out!

207
00:16:58,848 --> 00:17:00,109
How can this be happening?

208
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:03,990
There must be something we can do!
What will happen to us if she dies?

209
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:07,490
Nothing good. I'm sure our clan
will be banished after her succession.

210
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:11,110
Are there any other gods willing
to accept Regalia such as us?

211
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:15,931
Step forward this instant! Or I shall
have a god of calamity strike you down!

212
00:17:15,975 --> 00:17:17,529
God of calamity.

213
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:19,587
I'd heard rumors of him.

214
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:26,665
Of a god who reveled in atrocities,
wielded a Nora, and slaughtered all he saw.

215
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:31,329
If the guilty one will not confess, we
will have to hold an ablution for you all!

216
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:34,785
But we could never determine who was responsible.

217
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:41,014
The ablution rituals changed
nothing. Veena's condition worsened.

218
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,906
Whoever it is should confess!

219
00:17:44,651 --> 00:17:46,266
Shut up. I bet it's you.

220
00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:48,665
It's not me. It's her!

221
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:50,285
How dare you!

222
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:54,710
Suspicion and distrust built
among the ranks of the Regalia.

223
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:55,189
I will find the person...

224
00:17:55,214 --> 00:17:56,103
Until...

225
00:18:01,236 --> 00:18:05,722
Powerless to do anything, I had
no choice but to seek outside help.

226
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:11,394
I hoped this god of calamity
would grant the most taboo of wishes.

227
00:18:19,475 --> 00:18:24,559
The Ma Clan, Regalia of Bishamon, have
become corrupted. They cannot be saved!

228
00:18:25,013 --> 00:18:26,458
I beg you to kill them!

229
00:18:27,577 --> 00:18:32,306
I've made sure she's well drugged. And
Aiha's transgressions must be affecting her.

230
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:35,691
After everything I've done, she can still fight?

231
00:18:38,976 --> 00:18:43,794
Behold and tremble, for the
war god, Bishamon, is among us.

232
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:50,683
You stubborn louse. Aki, Koora,
Kinu. Keep your eyes on Yato!

233
00:18:52,993 --> 00:18:56,481
Why did she revert her weapons?
Is that a good idea, my lady?

234
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,827
Can't handle that much weight?

235
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,291
Somebody's corrupted you again, haven't they? Aww.

236
00:19:05,807 --> 00:19:07,740
My Regalia are loyal.

237
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:10,885
There are no traitors!

238
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:19,098
Now this is betrayal on a grand scale. Did you hear
him, Yato? This boy is begging us to kill his comrades.

239
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:20,769
What payment can you offer?

240
00:19:20,924 --> 00:19:23,128
I... I don't have anything.

241
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,212
You have your name. Do you want to be a Nora?

242
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:28,555
Kazuma!

243
00:19:30,951 --> 00:19:34,770
My name was given to me by my master. It belongs to her.

244
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:43,174
I have come here ready to die. We have disgraced our lady.
The "Ma" name will be forsaken, never to be called again.

245
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,890
But I don't care!

246
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:51,953
I will give my name back to her. If
it will save her, I'll do it gladly!

247
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:55,815
Take me there.

248
00:19:57,475 --> 00:19:59,017
You can repay me later.

249
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:07,447
The Regalia have become a giant
Phantom. That's the end for Bishamon.

250
00:20:07,657 --> 00:20:10,958
She'll die now and be replaced. It's for the best.

251
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:19,087
No! There she is! In its mouth. She hasn't
been absorbed yet. I beg you. Please save her!

252
00:20:20,223 --> 00:20:20,978
Hiki.

253
00:20:34,243 --> 00:20:35,111
My lady.

254
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,168
Please help me!

255
00:20:41,465 --> 00:20:48,765
Stop! Please! Don't kill them! Have
mercy! O' fierce deity. Take pity!

256
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,207
Don't kill my little ones, please!

257
00:20:51,678 --> 00:20:57,530
They're innocents. Gentle children,
all of them. I beg you! Don't kill them!

258
00:20:57,555 --> 00:20:58,603
My lady! Help!

259
00:20:58,628 --> 00:21:00,011
Please, my lady!

260
00:21:00,036 --> 00:21:02,710
Lady Bishamon!

261
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:16,242
How dare you? How dare you?

262
00:21:16,854 --> 00:21:22,647
Somehow, Veena survived that day.
However, her hatred for Yato endured.

263
00:21:24,062 --> 00:21:26,310
I'm sorry for burdening you with all this.

264
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:32,067
That's what you meant before. You told
me once... that you owed him a great deal.

265
00:21:34,007 --> 00:21:36,761
There's a way to stop them. There must be, right?

266
00:21:37,118 --> 00:21:41,465
If they keep fighting like this,
there'll be no undoing what happens.

267
00:21:47,332 --> 00:21:50,096
Tch! Nice try! Sekki!

268
00:21:51,094 --> 00:21:51,877
Now!

269
00:21:53,322 --> 00:21:54,376
Confine!

270
00:21:57,851 --> 00:21:59,068
You're finished.

271
00:21:59,978 --> 00:22:01,761
Come, Saiki!

272
00:22:11,174 --> 00:22:11,757
No...

273
00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:23,443
Yukine!

274
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:58,120
What was Yato like back when you met him, Kazuma?

275
00:23:58,154 --> 00:23:59,209
He was cool.

276
00:23:59,234 --> 00:24:02,609
"Cool"? The guy with the
tracksuit and "fluffy-fluff" scarf?

277
00:24:02,634 --> 00:24:08,112
On the next Noragami Aragoto: "Divine Acclamation,
Imprecation." Cool in a scary sort of way.

278
00:24:08,137 --> 00:24:09,912
He was cool. Wow.
