1
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,791
The entrance to the underworld.

2
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:07,215
And it's open, so he must already be inside.

3
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:08,112
Hey.

4
00:00:08,659 --> 00:00:11,179
Are you sure we'll be able to get back out once we go in?

5
00:00:11,423 --> 00:00:13,923
Entering the underworld is like jumping into a vent.

6
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:17,018
It's basically asking to get eaten by Phantoms.

7
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:19,631
Phantoms are the least of our worries.

8
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:23,225
Or have you forgotten? This is where Izanami dwells.

9
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:25,506
She's very different from other gods, right?

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,038
Deathless as she is.

11
00:00:27,298 --> 00:00:29,673
The eternal queen of the underworld.

12
00:00:29,756 --> 00:00:33,061
As long as life and death exist, she lives.

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,622
If she catches you, there's no escape.

14
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:38,814
You'll be stuck in the underworld for eternity.

15
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:42,664
Frightening, isn't it? But don't worry.

16
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:45,548
You've got me by your side. I'll protect you.

17
00:00:46,298 --> 00:00:50,655
And if I rescue this conjurer, you'll
give me my freedom, as promised, right?

18
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,648
Hiki.

19
00:00:57,548 --> 00:01:00,006
I can act as a protective barrier as well.

20
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,973
Don't tell me that precious
Blessed Vessel of yours can do this.

21
00:01:04,756 --> 00:01:05,594
Let's go.

22
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:41,173
Hey there, ladies! Have I got a sweet deal for you!

23
00:02:41,264 --> 00:02:41,931
I'll pass.

24
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:43,571
Hear me out, okay?

25
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,881
My uncle gave me a bunch of free tickets to Capypa Land,

26
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:50,285
and I was thinking it would be the
perfect chance to hang out with you-know-who.

27
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:52,006
Who are you talking about?

28
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,173
Oh! You mean that guy you like.

29
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:55,173
Who else?

30
00:02:55,256 --> 00:02:56,673
The joys of adolescence.

31
00:02:56,756 --> 00:02:58,256
So, I need you guys to come, too.

32
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,423
What do ya say?

33
00:02:59,506 --> 00:03:01,173
You want us with you on your date?

34
00:03:01,256 --> 00:03:03,423
Actually, it's gonna be more of a triple date.

35
00:03:03,506 --> 00:03:04,631
A triple date?

36
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:06,298
Yeah, he's bringing some friends with him.

37
00:03:06,365 --> 00:03:09,115
So that's where you two come in. Pretty please?

38
00:03:09,215 --> 00:03:10,715
Mm...

39
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:12,798
What is it about Capypa Land?

40
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:15,840
Aw! But I wanna go! I wanna go to Capypa Land!

41
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,583
I wanna! I wanna! I wanna! I wanna!

42
00:03:17,715 --> 00:03:20,506
I couldn't say anything then,
but I actually wanna go, too.

43
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,900
Are you in, Hiyori?

44
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,090
Uh... I don't think I can.

45
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:25,881
I made plans to go with someone else.

46
00:03:25,965 --> 00:03:26,756
With who?

47
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,965
Uh, with...

48
00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:30,298
Great, then it's decided!

49
00:03:30,381 --> 00:03:31,506
We're going next Sunday.

50
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:32,264
Huh?

51
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,881
Okay, fine. Count me in.

52
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:35,923
Youthful escapades, here we come!

53
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:38,798
But I don't wanna go on a date with
someone I've never even met before.

54
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:40,423
Don't worry! We'll be there, too.

55
00:03:40,506 --> 00:03:41,548
It'll be fine.

56
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:44,756
Hey, Hiyori! Have you seen Yato late...

57
00:03:45,798 --> 00:03:46,943
What is it, my lord?

58
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,131
Just let her go. She'll be much better off this way.

59
00:03:50,374 --> 00:03:52,465
Well. I should be leaving for the Colloquy.

60
00:03:52,548 --> 00:03:54,400
I'll see you when I return.

61
00:03:58,384 --> 00:04:01,018
I dunno if I'm up for a date this weekend.

62
00:04:04,783 --> 00:04:07,090
Wasting my time with another damn Colloquy!

63
00:04:07,173 --> 00:04:08,482
Didn't we just have one?

64
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,340
I'm a busy god, ya know?

65
00:04:10,423 --> 00:04:12,298
I gotta take my wittle Inaba for a wabbit walk!

66
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:17,406
Nushi! I missed you so much!

67
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:19,631
It's Lady Ebisu Kofuku!

68
00:04:19,715 --> 00:04:21,465
The infamous god of poverty?

69
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:22,646
He's done for.

70
00:04:23,215 --> 00:04:24,046
Kofuku!

71
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,673
Her enthusiasm can get the best of her.

72
00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:27,798
As her exemplar, you should train her better!

73
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:31,006
And what the hell're you thinking,
using our names without permission, huh?

74
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,722
Ebisu and I'll sue the pants off you, just wait!

75
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:36,512
Aw, now I wanna kiss you even more!

76
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:37,965
Such a big, burly god.

77
00:04:38,048 --> 00:04:40,163
And he's afraid of little Lady Kofuku.

78
00:04:40,506 --> 00:04:42,923
Poor Okuninushi's always been like that.

79
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:44,423
Very superstitious.

80
00:04:44,506 --> 00:04:47,030
Hi, Bisha. Hi, Kazu. How're you doin'?

81
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:48,965
We're fine. But I'm surprised.

82
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:50,423
It's rare to see you here.

83
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:53,423
Yeah, it is. Hey, have you seen Yatty by any chance?

84
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:54,310
Yato?

85
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:55,680
That's right.

86
00:04:55,794 --> 00:05:00,864
Since he's become a resident of Takamagahara,
he should've received today's summons.

87
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:03,715
Exactly. That's what we were hoping for, anyway.

88
00:05:03,798 --> 00:05:05,173
Has something happened?

89
00:05:05,256 --> 00:05:07,256
Seem's Yatty's done a disappearing act.

90
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,673
He's been in the Lower Realm for a whole month now.

91
00:05:09,886 --> 00:05:12,645
A month? But what about Yukine?

92
00:05:13,048 --> 00:05:16,865
It's strange. Yatty was so happy
he'd finally become an official god.

93
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:19,423
He was even excited about the Colloquies.

94
00:05:19,506 --> 00:05:22,299
That's why we're here. Maybe he came, too, you know?

95
00:05:28,922 --> 00:05:31,590
Careful not to make eye contact. They'll spot you.

96
00:05:31,673 --> 00:05:32,639
Yeah, I know.

97
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:35,924
Do you see that water? Bathe in it.

98
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,298
Gross!

99
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:42,604
Endure the stench. It'll keep the
nasty Phantoms from picking up your scent.

100
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:45,756
This brings back memories, doesn't it?

101
00:05:45,832 --> 00:05:48,123
Of all the time we spent together.

102
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:51,348
All the things we did. We were unstoppable.

103
00:05:51,423 --> 00:05:53,608
Together, there was nothing we feared.

104
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,491
Well, you remember.

105
00:05:56,634 --> 00:05:59,113
How many days have passed on the outside?

106
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:03,601
I've heard time flows differently
here, just like in Takamagahara.

107
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,995
Could they have forgotten me already?

108
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,278
Yato.

109
00:06:11,198 --> 00:06:13,471
A mask. Is the conjurer here?

110
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:19,146
Ebisu?

111
00:06:20,094 --> 00:06:22,515
I've gathered you all here with good reason.

112
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:26,114
There has been an important
development regarding the conjurer.

113
00:06:27,316 --> 00:06:29,548
Have you learned the conjurer's identity?

114
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:30,702
Who is it?

115
00:06:30,965 --> 00:06:34,673
To change a Phantom into a
puppet, it must be granted a name.

116
00:06:34,756 --> 00:06:36,131
Giving names to those?

117
00:06:36,215 --> 00:06:37,340
What a terrible thought!

118
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:39,465
It would mean instant corruption!

119
00:06:39,548 --> 00:06:41,072
Quiet, all of you!

120
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:44,950
As you've said, this conjurer must endure a great deal.

121
00:06:45,223 --> 00:06:49,549
Which indicates a god, a highly revered one, at that.

122
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,715
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

123
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:56,631
The Seven Gods of Fortune?

124
00:06:56,715 --> 00:06:58,381
No! You're wrong. It isn't us!

125
00:06:58,465 --> 00:07:01,131
What's more, how could you expose us like this?

126
00:07:01,215 --> 00:07:03,715
Anonymity is guaranteed at a Colloquy!

127
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,673
Uh-huh!

128
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:05,615
Fear not.

129
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:12,506
I am not implying that any of you is the
conjurer, but why are there only six of you here?

130
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:16,347
We've received a written tip, in fact.

131
00:07:16,923 --> 00:07:18,506
It reads as follows:

132
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,881
"I have witnessed someone
naming Phantoms in the Lower Realm.

133
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:25,019
The granter's name is Ebisu."

134
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,621
Liar!

135
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,048
Whoever wrote that phony tip is full of it!

136
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:30,238
Therefore.

137
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:33,631
Ebisu and Iwami, his overseer, are under arrest.

138
00:07:33,715 --> 00:07:35,548
Ridiculous! He's on his deathbed!

139
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:36,965
Leave him alone. He would never...

140
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:39,798
His residence is to be cordoned off and searched at once.

141
00:07:39,881 --> 00:07:42,862
Furthermore, all his Regalia are to be interrogated.

142
00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:44,256
Unbelievable!

143
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:49,246
Given this matter's sensitivity, we kindly ask
that the rest of the Gods of Fortune remain here.

144
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:50,402
That will be all.

145
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,381
What are you doing here, Yato god?

146
00:07:53,465 --> 00:07:54,590
Just what I was wondering.

147
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:56,537
What brings you to the underworld?

148
00:07:57,381 --> 00:07:58,923
Is that Yukine you wield?

149
00:07:59,006 --> 00:08:01,090
No. This is Hiiro.

150
00:08:03,881 --> 00:08:05,048
What a relief.

151
00:08:05,122 --> 00:08:07,066
I was hoping we'd catch up to you.

152
00:08:08,006 --> 00:08:09,881
Now we can fulfill Father's request.

153
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:12,274
You're the conjurer we were sent to rescue.

154
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:15,548
Hold on. The old man's connected to Ebisu?

155
00:08:15,631 --> 00:08:17,673
What old man? I'm lost.

156
00:08:17,756 --> 00:08:20,215
I'm afraid I don't know what
the two of you are talking about.

157
00:08:20,298 --> 00:08:23,279
Is this "old man" you speak of your father, Yato god?

158
00:08:24,127 --> 00:08:28,275
Hm. Your refusal to answer only makes me more curious.

159
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:32,241
And when I'm curious about something,
I can be very difficult to deter.

160
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:35,665
Regrettably, I don't have time to spend on this now.

161
00:08:36,006 --> 00:08:37,498
Ah. I know.

162
00:08:37,673 --> 00:08:39,570
We can talk further on the outside.

163
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:42,215
When would be a good time for you?

164
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:43,506
You're missing the point.

165
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,370
I came down here to rescue you.

166
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:47,631
You came all this way to rescue me?

167
00:08:47,715 --> 00:08:48,965
Well that's very kind of you.

168
00:08:49,057 --> 00:08:51,215
All right. I've had about enough of this cesspool.

169
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:52,406
Let's get outta here.

170
00:08:53,006 --> 00:08:54,548
Hey, where the hell are you going?

171
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:56,121
I can't leave just yet.

172
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,332
The Phantoms have increased in number.

173
00:08:58,423 --> 00:08:59,923
Don't make eye contact!

174
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,173
Oh, look at that.

175
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:03,131
There appears to be one heading right for you.

176
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:05,429
Hiki!

177
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,756
Oh, here's another one.

178
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,965
Stop looking at them, will you?

179
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,010
Hey! There's one behind you!

180
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:21,881
My, that was excellent work.

181
00:09:21,974 --> 00:09:24,341
I can see that you'll come in very handy down here.

182
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,466
I'm terribly uncoordinated, you see.

183
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:28,840
In fact, I can't even tie my own shoes.

184
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:31,090
Tell me, are you any good with a bow knot?

185
00:09:31,173 --> 00:09:33,715
Well. I'm better with bondage knots.

186
00:09:33,798 --> 00:09:35,215
Oh? That's very impressive.

187
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:36,590
Are you for real?

188
00:09:36,673 --> 00:09:38,945
I'm entirely reliant upon my Regalia.

189
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:41,756
How rude. I should have introduced them by now.

190
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:45,115
Please forgive me. Kuni. Tatsu. Uta.

191
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:48,465
You brought your Regalia with you?

192
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:49,215
I'm Kunimi.

193
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:49,965
I'm Tatsumi.

194
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:50,974
I'm Utami.

195
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:54,604
Incidentally, Kunimi ties the
best bow knot you'll ever see.

196
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,590
Next time, let's give these "bondage knots" a try.

197
00:09:57,673 --> 00:09:58,715
Of course, Young Master.

198
00:09:58,806 --> 00:09:59,923
What's with you people?

199
00:10:00,006 --> 00:10:01,575
It seems the path splits here.

200
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:04,209
This guy's gonna make my head explode.

201
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,298
Young Master!

202
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:10,750
What is it? What's wrong?

203
00:10:11,215 --> 00:10:13,409
Whoa, hold on! Are you blighted?

204
00:10:13,806 --> 00:10:15,277
It's nothing to worry about.

205
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:19,411
Guessing it was your conjured Phantoms that did this.

206
00:10:19,707 --> 00:10:22,896
Unfortunately, my invocations are still far from perfect.

207
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:26,637
For now, I merely control
Phantoms using masks I've collected.

208
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:29,905
This system does have its merits, however.

209
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:36,703
It may sound odd, but there is a certain satisfaction
in naming and employing a Phantom as one would a Regalia.

210
00:10:37,316 --> 00:10:39,954
Although, I must admit that it has been far from easy.

211
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,433
I am tainted by each failure, you see.

212
00:10:43,881 --> 00:10:46,207
Masked Ones demand even greater strength.

213
00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:48,457
They're far beyond me at present.

214
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:50,673
Not for much longer, though.

215
00:10:50,756 --> 00:10:52,756
Soon I will have the necessary power.

216
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,125
You're in bad shape.

217
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:55,923
We need to get you out of here soon.

218
00:10:56,006 --> 00:10:56,737
No, thank you.

219
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,840
These Phantoms are nothing. Not compared to what's ahead.

220
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:01,668
You don't wanna go any further, trust me.

221
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:03,181
Why, because of Izanami?

222
00:11:06,256 --> 00:11:07,881
She's the reason I'm here.

223
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:10,656
I came to see Izanami and get a Locution Brush.

224
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,806
Now if you don't mind, let's be on our way.

225
00:11:20,903 --> 00:11:21,921
Where are we?

226
00:11:25,048 --> 00:11:27,342
I haven't had guests in ages!

227
00:11:27,673 --> 00:11:28,741
Wha...? Hiyori?

228
00:11:32,756 --> 00:11:34,465
Well? Come in, come in!

229
00:11:34,548 --> 00:11:36,549
No! It can't be her.

230
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,750
The woman from the Olive Tavern?

231
00:11:39,262 --> 00:11:40,631
Make yourselves comfortable!

232
00:11:40,715 --> 00:11:41,798
What, are you blind?

233
00:11:41,896 --> 00:11:43,886
That is clearly a high school girl!

234
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,843
High school girl? You're crazy.

235
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:48,780
Hey, I see the way you're looking at her, you old pervert!

236
00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:51,840
The woman from the Olive Tavern is
definitely not a high school girl.

237
00:11:51,923 --> 00:11:54,423
No mere teenager can make steaks as good as hers are.

238
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,631
What the hell are you talking about?

239
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,949
Would you care for some refreshments?

240
00:12:00,256 --> 00:12:02,215
Don't eat or drink anything here.

241
00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:04,024
If you do, you'll never leave.

242
00:12:04,606 --> 00:12:06,698
Please have some. There's plenty.

243
00:12:07,173 --> 00:12:09,997
Oh, what's wrong? Do you not like me?

244
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,476
Don't be shy now, of course you do!

245
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,381
You're not alone. Everybody likes me.

246
00:12:16,465 --> 00:12:18,289
Can I tell you a secret, though?

247
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:21,999
I think I like you best of all. Let me show you.

248
00:12:22,782 --> 00:12:23,896
Get away from her!

249
00:12:26,173 --> 00:12:27,798
Ah, I understand now.

250
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,860
She must alter her appearance
based upon the person looking at her.

251
00:12:31,561 --> 00:12:35,669
She dons the guise of someone close to
you to make it easier to trap you down here.

252
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,443
The queen of the underworld. Izanami.

253
00:12:39,965 --> 00:12:43,257
You should know I have no intention
of negotiating fairly with her.

254
00:12:43,548 --> 00:12:44,881
That would be a waste of my time.

255
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:45,584
Huh?

256
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:48,631
Um, hi. I'm Akira Yamashita.

257
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:50,131
It's nice to meet you.

258
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:51,798
I'm Aimi Tabata.

259
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:53,125
And I'm Hiyori Iki.

260
00:12:53,298 --> 00:12:54,215
I'm Seki.

261
00:12:54,298 --> 00:12:55,266
My name's Abe.

262
00:12:55,756 --> 00:12:57,673
This girly version of you is so cute!

263
00:12:57,764 --> 00:13:00,173
So... who is he? Which one of them's your guy?

264
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:01,840
He isn't here yet.

265
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:03,394
Sorry I'm so late.

266
00:13:04,506 --> 00:13:05,665
Hi. I'm Fujisaki.

267
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:08,506
Don't worry about being late.

268
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,756
I'm just glad you could make it.

269
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:11,931
Really, thanks for coming! This'll be so fun!

270
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:13,069
Where would you like to go first?

271
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:14,215
I hate waiting in line.

272
00:13:14,298 --> 00:13:15,756
Let's get some Fast Tickets.

273
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,006
Whoa, what's that you've got?

274
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,340
Limited edition Hundred Archfiends swag!

275
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,965
You've heard of the Hundred Archfiends?

276
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:24,090
Uh, yeah! Hasn't everybody? Hun... dred...

277
00:13:24,173 --> 00:13:24,881
Arch

278
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:25,881
fiends!

279
00:13:25,965 --> 00:13:28,048
Uh... So much for cute and girly!

280
00:13:28,131 --> 00:13:29,715
Any idea what they're talking about?

281
00:13:30,921 --> 00:13:32,965
It's this obscure band nobody's ever heard of.

282
00:13:33,048 --> 00:13:35,301
Plenty of people know who they are!

283
00:13:36,084 --> 00:13:36,840
I'm sorry.

284
00:13:36,923 --> 00:13:38,298
You kinda got dragged along today.

285
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:39,590
Oh, no. I'm sorry!

286
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:42,173
I guess Yama can be kinda flaky sometimes.

287
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:43,216
It's okay.

288
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:45,717
She mentioned you would be coming, too, so...

289
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,915
Well, where should we start?

290
00:13:49,055 --> 00:13:52,100
I'm a little lost. I've never been here before.

291
00:13:53,756 --> 00:13:54,507
Heh.

292
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:59,715
Lady Izanami. I was told that I
could find a Locution Brush here.

293
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,949
One that is able to control Phantoms.

294
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:04,631
I have come to humbly request that you give it to me.

295
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:05,863
How rude.

296
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:08,710
I'm sure you meant to say that you came to see me.

297
00:14:09,256 --> 00:14:12,006
You are the second one to come asking for a brush, though.

298
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:12,836
Huh?

299
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:15,692
These are the objects in question.

300
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:19,675
No way...

301
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,171
Enki.

302
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,881
We would like some tea please, Enki.

303
00:14:26,957 --> 00:14:27,945
Right away.

304
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,678
I created these myself.

305
00:14:31,048 --> 00:14:33,404
I made them because I wanted friends.

306
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:36,604
Friends who wouldn't leave me. You see...

307
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:40,256
Everyone who looks upon my true form leaves.

308
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,442
Always.

309
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,965
You want this badly, don't you?

310
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:46,006
If I give it to you, will you be my friend?

311
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:47,070
Your friend?

312
00:14:48,465 --> 00:14:51,530
Unfortunately, being your friend
is not something that I can do.

313
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:53,959
However...

314
00:14:57,256 --> 00:15:00,923
Yato. Don't fight her. I mean it.

315
00:15:01,006 --> 00:15:03,528
She's on an entirely different level than us.

316
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,739
Not even I am sharp enough to harm her.

317
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:09,131
My offer is a simple one.

318
00:15:09,215 --> 00:15:11,381
I will give you the Locution Brush.

319
00:15:11,465 --> 00:15:14,277
In exchange, one of you will stay here and be my friend.

320
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:16,045
That part is up to you.

321
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,038
You should think hard before deciding.

322
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:21,319
The agreement will be binding.

323
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,912
I'm sorry it worked out this way.

324
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:27,631
Wait, what are you saying?

325
00:15:27,715 --> 00:15:29,673
You're the one who will remain here in the underworld.

326
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:32,416
I came for the brush. I mean to leave with it.

327
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:36,446
I came to save your ass, and
this is how you say "thank you"?

328
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:51,972
Awesome!

329
00:15:52,465 --> 00:15:54,965
I always wanted to get my photo taken with one of those.

330
00:15:55,048 --> 00:15:56,340
I know, me, too!

331
00:15:56,423 --> 00:16:00,844
I wanted to get one with me and, uh, me and...

332
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:07,923
Restraint!

333
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:09,016
Borderline!

334
00:16:11,465 --> 00:16:12,360
Excellent!

335
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:14,131
It's just you!

336
00:16:14,215 --> 00:16:15,610
Hello! Thirsty?

337
00:16:16,465 --> 00:16:18,588
Quit ambushing me like that, will you?

338
00:16:18,715 --> 00:16:20,815
It's my version of a pop quiz.

339
00:16:21,798 --> 00:16:23,423
So the Colloquy's over, then?

340
00:16:23,506 --> 00:16:27,042
No, they sent all the attendants
home early for some reason.

341
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:28,773
That almost never happens.

342
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:32,256
Huh. What about Yato? Was he there?

343
00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:33,048
No.

344
00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:33,987
Okay.

345
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:36,998
So, Yukine. I heard Yato's disappeared.

346
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,287
Is that really true?

347
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,147
Yeah. Apparently, it happens all the time.

348
00:16:42,631 --> 00:16:45,627
He seems a lot calmer than I would expect him to be.

349
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:49,932
I know all too well how a
troubled Regalia can harm its master.

350
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:52,898
He's staying calm for Yato's sake.

351
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,636
You've made great progress.

352
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:56,161
Huh?

353
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,965
Okay, then. Today, we'll practice Restraints.

354
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:00,465
Great! I'm ready!

355
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:09,006
Kunimi is a rare type of Regalia
that can control its master's movements.

356
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,861
Unarmed combat is his specialty.

357
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:15,473
Tatsumi and Utami are very capable, too.

358
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:18,631
I may not be a god of war, but I am a god of fortune.

359
00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:21,548
And as such, I have great confidence in my luck.

360
00:17:25,173 --> 00:17:25,965
Oh.

361
00:17:26,381 --> 00:17:28,173
I hear you reincarnate all the time.

362
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,417
Sounds real lucky.

363
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,881
My Masked Ones come at a prince.

364
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:34,673
They've devoured many of my previous incarnations.

365
00:17:34,756 --> 00:17:37,798
Tch. You talk about reincarnating like it's nothing.

366
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:40,704
Why are so bent on being a conjurer?

367
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,240
Let me ask you.

368
00:17:42,374 --> 00:17:45,344
Why do you exist, Yato god? Why are you still here?

369
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:48,048
I did some research before I came to visit you.

370
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:49,496
I like to be informed.

371
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:54,951
Formally, you're considered a god of war,
but some stories say you're a god of calamity.

372
00:17:55,673 --> 00:17:59,380
Those instances aside, I've only
heard your name in a few oral traditions.

373
00:17:59,756 --> 00:18:01,965
If you're so close to vanishing already, then why...?

374
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,590
Stop talking!

375
00:18:03,673 --> 00:18:06,506
I was born from people's wishes, just like you!

376
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,090
So I don't wanna disappear.

377
00:18:08,165 --> 00:18:09,986
Tell me what's wrong with that, huh?

378
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,449
I wanted to make them happy, that's all. Okay?

379
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:19,965
You're not lookin' so good.

380
00:18:20,048 --> 00:18:22,070
That blight must be pretty painful.

381
00:18:22,923 --> 00:18:23,715
I envy you.

382
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:24,358
Huh?

383
00:18:24,756 --> 00:18:26,006
The way you care about your life.

384
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:29,090
It's not something I've experienced. Such passion.

385
00:18:29,173 --> 00:18:31,423
You have the determination that marks a good god.

386
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:34,051
The kind of god that can make people happy.

387
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,666
Hurry! You can't take much more.

388
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:43,827
It's a mistake to underestimate my men.

389
00:18:45,462 --> 00:18:46,396
Come, Hi...

390
00:18:46,444 --> 00:18:47,402
Come, Toki!

391
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:54,799
That was such an exciting fight.

392
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,166
And it looks like you get to stay and be my friend, Yato!

393
00:19:02,423 --> 00:19:06,048
I have what I came for. Shall we go now, Yato god?

394
00:19:06,131 --> 00:19:07,965
Bastard! You planned this all along?

395
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:11,060
I did tell you I had no intention of negotiating fairly.

396
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:12,474
And you, Hiiro!

397
00:19:14,756 --> 00:19:15,687
What gives?

398
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:17,298
You didn't tell me you served Ebisu, too.

399
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:18,173
Sorry.

400
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:19,548
Small world, isn't it?

401
00:19:19,684 --> 00:19:21,965
Kunimi says I named her five incarnations back.

402
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:23,398
Is that right, Tsutsumi?

403
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:25,289
Yes. It's been awhile.

404
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:27,673
This is sort of an awkward reunion, isn't it?

405
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:30,798
I mean, I know you're a Nora
and all, but this is a lot to take.

406
00:19:30,895 --> 00:19:33,340
It's strange, but I suddenly feel much closer to you.

407
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:34,548
Stop! Ew!

408
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:39,255
You're leaving? You can't do that. You
were supposed to stay and be my friend!

409
00:19:39,506 --> 00:19:40,923
We need to hurry.

410
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:41,828
Hiki!

411
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:46,495
What are you doing? Come on!

412
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:52,308
I'm glad I was able to see you. Goodbye, Mother.

413
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:55,141
Hold on. Mother?

414
00:19:56,766 --> 00:20:00,944
Please don't leave me! I'm so lonely.

415
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:05,240
So very lonely. I won't let you.

416
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,238
You'll stay here with my other friends!

417
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:14,173
I suspect it would be best if we
got out of here as quickly as we can.

418
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:15,099
Uh-huh.

419
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,731
Hiyori and Yukine are out there waiting for me.

420
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,592
I will make it back to them.

421
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:27,481
It's so strange.

422
00:20:27,715 --> 00:20:31,204
I feel like I'm close to remembering
something, but I don't know what it is.

423
00:20:32,256 --> 00:20:34,423
Oh! A Capypa with a crown.

424
00:20:34,498 --> 00:20:36,207
They'll love this little guy!

425
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:38,583
Of course, they won't share, so I'll get two.

426
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:40,758
Or maybe one for all three of us!

427
00:20:41,212 --> 00:20:44,673
Three for you, too? They for your family?

428
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:46,465
No. Actually, they're for...

429
00:20:48,631 --> 00:20:50,923
They're for... Who?

430
00:20:53,006 --> 00:20:56,381
What's going on? Something feels wrong.

431
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:58,423
The parade's starting in a second.

432
00:20:58,506 --> 00:20:59,673
We should get going.

433
00:20:59,756 --> 00:21:01,003
What is it?

434
00:21:01,298 --> 00:21:03,506
I feel like I'm forgetting something.

435
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,701
Something that's really important.

436
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,469
Ready? We...

437
00:21:12,878 --> 00:21:15,402
So many glittering, colorful lights.

438
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:17,904
Fireworks flooding the sky.

439
00:21:18,582 --> 00:21:21,465
A sparkling parade procession illuminating the night.

440
00:21:23,465 --> 00:21:28,741
Even the people's smiles seem to shine
brightly, giving off a rosy, cheerful glow.

441
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:30,526
But to me...

442
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,163
To me it all seems distant and dull.

443
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,419
The light feels so far away.

444
00:21:38,323 --> 00:21:40,279
It seems like someone's missing.

445
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:42,940
Someone who should be next to me, smiling.

446
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,758
Who did I wanna get a picture with?

447
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:50,296
Who did I want to give a present to? Who isn't here?

448
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:54,533
Or am I wrong? Am I imagining things?

449
00:21:57,673 --> 00:21:58,648
You okay?

450
00:22:01,923 --> 00:22:05,119
Why? Why can't I remember?

451
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:08,851
I wanted to come here with him. To get a picture together.

452
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:13,589
I... I wanted to stay by his side, but now...

453
00:23:55,378 --> 00:23:57,381
Oh, dear. I forgot my hand cream.

454
00:23:57,465 --> 00:23:59,715
Hand cream? That's very dainty of you.

455
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:02,694
It's very difficult to count
money with dry fingertips, you know.

456
00:24:03,131 --> 00:24:06,340
On the next Noragami Aragoto: "A Certain Desire."

457
00:24:06,423 --> 00:24:07,840
Yeah, of course I know!

458
00:24:07,923 --> 00:24:09,338
I know all about money!
