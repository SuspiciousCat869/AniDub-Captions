1
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:08,930
Dr. Kuga. I need help. Can I
have a bit more of that medicine?

2
00:00:09,393 --> 00:00:15,869
Hm. This one looks deeper than the last. What
did you do to Tsuguha? Did you lose control again?

3
00:00:15,894 --> 00:00:23,552
You can't blame me! Tsuguha's a glory hog! I fought
honorably as our lady's Divine Garment for a half-century.

4
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,578
Until that four-eyed loser showed up and took my spot!

5
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:31,306
I want to help the master, that's all!

6
00:00:33,187 --> 00:00:34,157
Actually...

7
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:38,994
If you're willing, there is a way you
can help her. Can I count on you, Aiha?

8
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:14,006
Thank you! Have a good day.

9
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:17,704
I better get going. See you guys tomorr...

10
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:21,831
Wait just a second. Why two cheese
buns? You can't be that hungry.

11
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:22,378
Huh?

12
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:26,898
You know, you have been going off
on your own a lot lately. Why is that?

13
00:02:27,138 --> 00:02:28,829
Do you have a boyfriend?

14
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:30,519
Wha...? No, of course not!

15
00:02:30,544 --> 00:02:32,117
Such a vehement denial.

16
00:02:32,142 --> 00:02:34,318
Yep. Suspicious! Very suspicious!

17
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:36,554
Well, you'll have to introduce us to him sometime.

18
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:37,245
Huh?

19
00:02:37,354 --> 00:02:38,585
He'd better be hot!

20
00:02:38,674 --> 00:02:39,348
Wait!

21
00:02:39,373 --> 00:02:42,063
Give your love a smooch for us, okay?

22
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,258
Oh, come on. It's not like that!

23
00:02:49,232 --> 00:02:50,938
I know that smell.

24
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,704
Why are you always following me? Huh? Stalker Boy?

25
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:09,486
I'm not stalking you, I'm watching
you! It's a totally legitimate job duty!

26
00:03:09,511 --> 00:03:11,305
Nothing better to do, huh?

27
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,511
Giving you divine protection
isn't nothing! That's blasphemous!

28
00:03:14,536 --> 00:03:15,805
Here, take it.

29
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:21,097
Make sure you give some to Yukine. You asked
me to get you a Four-Cheese Melty Bun, remember?

30
00:03:27,895 --> 00:03:32,657
I don't know what's got you acting like this
lately, but it's really getting out of hand.

31
00:03:33,168 --> 00:03:34,223
Tell you what.

32
00:03:35,122 --> 00:03:38,456
How about I make it a point to see you every day?

33
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:41,174
Will that make you feel better?

34
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:44,535
Maybe then you can stop sneaking around like a...

35
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:54,497
Hey! Don't get the wrong idea, okay? You just
still haven't done the job I paid you to do! So, I...

36
00:03:56,626 --> 00:04:03,187
Look. Unlike you, I keep my promises.
And I promise. I'm not going to forget you!

37
00:04:13,563 --> 00:04:14,690
Uh...

38
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,817
I hope that doesn't turn out to be a lie.

39
00:04:18,854 --> 00:04:20,384
Huh? What's that?

40
00:04:21,186 --> 00:04:23,132
Your panties were showing just then.

41
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:27,263
Ah!

42
00:04:32,508 --> 00:04:34,025
I owe you an apology.

43
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:37,259
Lady Bishamon has been in poor health recently.

44
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:41,154
And in my desperation, I acted rashly.

45
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:44,194
You haven't heard the latest news, have you?

46
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:44,958
Huh?

47
00:04:45,945 --> 00:04:47,907
It seems Suzuha has died.

48
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:53,411
I also wondered why Lady Bishamon
had been feeling so poorly lately.

49
00:04:53,464 --> 00:04:55,564
I checked to see if a Regalia had gone missing.

50
00:04:56,853 --> 00:05:01,340
Suzuha descended to the Lower Realm
on a daily basis to care for his tree.

51
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:04,797
I can only assume Phantoms in the area preyed on him.

52
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,238
The pain of losing a Regalia
in such a way must be incredible.

53
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:13,433
I doubt it is something that
you or I could ever comprehend.

54
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,454
What torment! For her to suffer alone, and in silence...

55
00:05:22,648 --> 00:05:24,818
That's her way. Always so strong.

56
00:05:26,557 --> 00:05:32,137
Could you stay by our lady's side until I return? I
need to find out more about what happened to Suzuha.

57
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:38,554
My back is completely destroyed again!

58
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,664
Do you wanna move? I'm cleaning, here!

59
00:05:41,484 --> 00:05:44,425
Would it kill you to show your
master respect once in a while?

60
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,429
Yeah, it might.

61
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:48,789
Listen, I was gonna go see Suzuha
after I'm done with these chores.

62
00:05:49,234 --> 00:05:50,432
That's cool, right?

63
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:53,623
No. It's not.

64
00:05:55,118 --> 00:05:56,071
What do you mean?

65
00:05:56,462 --> 00:05:59,392
You had no problem with it the other day. So what changed?

66
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:01,604
Forget Suzuha. You won't be seeing him anymore.

67
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:02,149
Huh?

68
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:06,299
Yeah, you and Bishamon have issues,
but that's got nothing to do with us.

69
00:06:06,497 --> 00:06:08,887
Suzuha's my friend. I don't know what the big deal is...

70
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:09,859
Yukine.

71
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:13,129
Stay away from that cherry tree.

72
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:16,857
Pardon me, Lady Bishamon. I've brought your medicine.

73
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,878
Who...? Oh, Kugaha.

74
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:26,167
I'm a bit dazed. I was dreaming.

75
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:27,543
Oh? Of what?

76
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:32,802
Of a boy who loved to grow
flowers, and the day that I named him.

77
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:39,645
Never mind. I'm rambling. I've been
feeling so very weak and run-down lately.

78
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:41,753
At least I haven't been corrupted, though.

79
00:06:42,658 --> 00:06:46,281
It's too bad Kazuma isn't here.
I know what a help he is to you.

80
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:49,468
Yes. He's very busy these days.

81
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:54,003
He just left for the Lower
Realm. He seemed to be in a hurry.

82
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:56,378
Oh, really? I wonder what he's up to.

83
00:06:56,755 --> 00:06:58,278
You wouldn't happen to know?

84
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:01,550
Well, I don't have any details.

85
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,329
I really shouldn't say.

86
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:04,583
Oh, what is it?

87
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:07,968
I hate to gossip, but, I saw something.

88
00:07:09,455 --> 00:07:12,800
I saw Suzuha and the Yato god's Regalia together.

89
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:19,419
I hope you haven't burned yourself, my
lady! I'll brew some more right away. Excuse me.

90
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:23,837
No, it can't be. Surely.

91
00:07:31,098 --> 00:07:33,919
That did it. I think I finally ditched my stalker.

92
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,084
Whoops! I dropped my snack stick!

93
00:07:36,203 --> 00:07:37,168
Oooh!

94
00:07:37,793 --> 00:07:39,619
That ought to buy me 45 minutes.

95
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,173
Heaven!

96
00:07:41,454 --> 00:07:43,334
Man, what's his problem, anyway?

97
00:07:43,818 --> 00:07:47,163
All I want is to go see my friend. He's such a jerk.

98
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:49,996
I hope Suzuha's around today!

99
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:57,639
Kazuma's here?

100
00:08:03,052 --> 00:08:03,909
Yukine.

101
00:08:05,498 --> 00:08:07,681
Stay away from that cherry tree.

102
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,539
It isn't safe there.

103
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:18,604
Suzuha?

104
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:26,727
Yukine.

105
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:32,470
Nora.

106
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:41,872
Humans carry so many emotions with them,
even in death. Joy. Anger. Heartache. Pleasure.

107
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:46,218
Look. See how easily it unravels?

108
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:50,714
Once a bond has come unraveled, there's no mending it.

109
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:55,338
Careful not to become entangled,
or it will choke you as a Scourge.

110
00:08:56,044 --> 00:09:02,178
You know, Yato. If something holds you
back, you're better off just cutting it down.

111
00:09:05,235 --> 00:09:10,755
It was faint, but I could sense a Storm had
been there. Phantoms really must have attacked him.

112
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:17,843
I was so focused on Veena, I forgot about
everyone else. I failed as their exemplar!

113
00:09:17,868 --> 00:09:19,051
Kazuma! Wait!

114
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:26,576
Oww.

115
00:09:27,236 --> 00:09:27,941
Yukine?

116
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:30,252
Huh? Hey, what happened?

117
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:31,841
What is this? Where am I?

118
00:09:31,897 --> 00:09:33,018
Are you crazy?

119
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:35,130
This is Lady Bishamon's manor!

120
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:36,759
Whoa. Is it, really?

121
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:40,695
Well, that's perfect! Suzuha! I know you're here!

122
00:09:40,773 --> 00:09:41,075
Suzuha!

123
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,910
No! Yukine, stop! Suzuha is...

124
00:09:45,428 --> 00:09:47,208
He's gone. Suzuha is dead.

125
00:09:48,178 --> 00:09:49,868
He's... dead?

126
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:53,635
Never mind that! You need to hide!
If Veena should find you here...

127
00:09:59,076 --> 00:09:59,822
Gaiki!

128
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,628
No! Milady! You mustn't shed blood here! Please.

129
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:11,532
Well, Kazuma. Do you care to explain?
What are you doing with his Regalia?

130
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:13,151
It's complicated.

131
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:16,401
Please, I know you hate Yato,
but I'm a friend of Suzuha's.

132
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:17,639
Suzu...

133
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:23,472
Please, Lady Bishamon, will you tell me how he
died? I want to know what happened to my friend!

134
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:31,555
Yukine. He was attacked.
Phantoms got him in the Lower Realm.

135
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,422
What the hell?

136
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:39,362
I asked you. You're his master, aren't you?

137
00:10:39,698 --> 00:10:44,109
You named him, didn't you?!
Then why couldn't you answer me?

138
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:48,482
I get it! You have so many, what
does one measly Regalia matter, right?

139
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,010
Don't you care that he's dead?

140
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:54,322
It hurt him to be ignored, but I bet you didn't know that!

141
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:58,709
Considering how many Regalia she
has, I haven't been called up in years.

142
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:00,505
But he still smiled.

143
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:03,659
Whatever else he felt, he kept inside.

144
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,750
He smiled so that you wouldn't suffer.

145
00:11:07,385 --> 00:11:09,091
Always. Always.

146
00:11:09,828 --> 00:11:14,757
He always, always, always forced
himself to smile. For decades!

147
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:19,777
Together, they're the ultimate team of
Regalia for the ultimate god of war, Bishamon!

148
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:21,716
Ultimate god, my ass!

149
00:11:22,202 --> 00:11:27,557
You couldn't be bothered to protect
one Regalia, and now he's dead. Some god!

150
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:30,870
Even with so many, she treats us like family.

151
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:33,983
It's just one big, happy family, huh?

152
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,010
Looks like hell to me.

153
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:41,736
Veena!

154
00:11:49,104 --> 00:11:52,537
Stay calm! We all must stay in tune with each other.

155
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:53,622
Is it true?

156
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:56,358
There was a rumor about you.

157
00:11:57,057 --> 00:12:00,035
That you helped with an ablution that saved Yato!

158
00:12:00,297 --> 00:12:03,355
Have you been in contact with him? Tell me!

159
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:06,645
Oh, Veena.

160
00:12:07,472 --> 00:12:10,474
He isn't your mortal enemy! He is your savior!

161
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:11,078
Huh?

162
00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:15,480
You're wrong! He is the monster who slaughtered my family.

163
00:12:16,564 --> 00:12:18,292
How could you do this to me?

164
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:21,437
You... traitor!

165
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:29,432
He drew a line...

166
00:12:30,104 --> 00:12:31,465
...against the master!

167
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:37,591
Choki!

168
00:12:39,031 --> 00:12:43,256
I, the god Bishamon... hereby revoke your...

169
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:56,889
Consider yourself exiled. Be a Nora for all I care.

170
00:13:17,694 --> 00:13:18,709
Help the new girl.

171
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:23,354
It's really sad about Kazuma getting kicked out,
but I guess I don't get why it's that big a deal.

172
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:27,612
I mean, these things happen,
right? Regalia get fired all the time.

173
00:13:27,862 --> 00:13:31,314
It's not like we can't replace
him. He was just a navigator.

174
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,836
No. He's not "just a navigator."

175
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:35,463
What do you mean, Kazuha?

176
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:41,191
You know Karuha and I are the lady's guns. We
may be powerful, but we have a hard time aiming.

177
00:13:41,646 --> 00:13:46,874
Kazuma's the one who helps us hit our targets.
Without him, we'll actually be a lot less accurate.

178
00:13:47,772 --> 00:13:49,645
Whoa! Seriously?

179
00:13:50,694 --> 00:13:52,027
That goes for me, too.

180
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:53,515
Yugiha, no way!

181
00:13:53,854 --> 00:13:59,171
My blade is really sharp. It can cut almost
anything, but I'm terrible at drawing Borderlines.

182
00:13:59,243 --> 00:14:01,546
So, I end up cutting things of the living world, too.

183
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:05,940
It's Kazuma who helps hold me back.
With him gone, it'll be more hit-or-miss.

184
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:11,819
Our awesome war god is starting to sound more like
a plain old god of destruction! What are we gonna do?

185
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:14,218
Calm down, everyone.

186
00:14:14,736 --> 00:14:20,260
There's no point moaning about Kazuma's absence.
We need to stay strong and believe in ourselves.

187
00:14:20,856 --> 00:14:22,205
You might be right.

188
00:14:22,555 --> 00:14:28,359
First, touch base with all the other Regalia. Tell them
not to spend their time dwelling on Kazuma's betrayal.

189
00:14:29,606 --> 00:14:34,689
Lady Bishamon has enough heartache as it is.
I don't want any of us causing her more pain.

190
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:39,972
I'm lost. So, Kazuma was working with
Yato, who killed a bunch of us years ago?

191
00:14:40,306 --> 00:14:44,387
But what exactly happened back
then? Who were the Regalia he killed?

192
00:14:49,893 --> 00:14:53,195
No one really knows the answer
to that. None of us, anyway.

193
00:14:53,562 --> 00:14:57,451
The only ones who were actually there
when it happened were Milady and Kazuma.

194
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,233
They speak of it very rarely. But...

195
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:05,117
He isn't your mortal enemy! He is your savior!

196
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:08,367
What did he mean? How is Yato her savior?

197
00:15:08,962 --> 00:15:10,064
Stop that.

198
00:15:10,106 --> 00:15:10,376
Huh?

199
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:13,332
Kazuma's a traitor and we mustn't pay heed to his words.

200
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:17,090
It's true we have lost our leader.
But our goal remains the same.

201
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,625
We must gather our strength and protect our master.

202
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,494
Yes, Dr. Kuga.

203
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:25,549
That's the only thing we can do now.

204
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:29,868
Oh, good. Another stray to take in.

205
00:15:29,893 --> 00:15:32,994
I'm sorry. I couldn't think of anywhere else to go.

206
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,821
We give Yukine a room to study
in, and this is what happens.

207
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,012
We aren't running a bed and breakfast here, people.

208
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:43,915
What's the harm in letting Yukine's
friends sleep over? Lighten up, Daddy Daikoku!

209
00:15:44,702 --> 00:15:48,737
You call me that again and I will break
your face! This is all your fault, as usual!

210
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,765
None of it would have happened if you
weren't so easily distracted by your stomach!

211
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,506
Eat before it gets cold, Kazu. Go on, take it.

212
00:15:55,531 --> 00:15:57,483
Waste any and I'll kill you!

213
00:15:57,753 --> 00:16:00,065
It smells delicious. You're so kind.

214
00:16:00,536 --> 00:16:03,284
I'm sorry. I've been so worried about Veena.

215
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:05,898
And the Regalia I let die.

216
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:11,127
A Regalia? What, you mean Suzuha?
It isn't like you killed him, though.

217
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:14,186
I didn't protect him. It's close enough.

218
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:19,556
No, it's not. Quit blaming yourself for
everything. That really affects us, you know!

219
00:16:22,145 --> 00:16:23,638
Yukine's hurting,

220
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,534
First, he loses his friend, then he
gets you in trouble with your master.

221
00:16:28,514 --> 00:16:29,845
He's taking it hard.

222
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:35,015
I don't blame him. It's got me feeling like crap, too.

223
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:38,797
Why stay here? There must be safer places for you to go.

224
00:16:39,193 --> 00:16:41,412
Aren't you risking Veena discovering you?

225
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:45,741
Yeah. I guess I am.

226
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,929
No change. He's still crying.

227
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:52,694
How are you holding up, Yato?

228
00:16:53,783 --> 00:16:54,688
I'm okay.

229
00:16:54,995 --> 00:16:59,153
Hey! You're drinking at a time like
this? Don't you care about Yukine?

230
00:16:59,178 --> 00:17:01,543
I am pretty sure they say booze is the best medicine.

231
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:02,792
You've had enough!

232
00:17:03,472 --> 00:17:07,174
Wait, give it back! Please! It
helps me! You don't understand!

233
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,850
Quit pulling on me!

234
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:12,693
Oh, I see. So that's the reason he stays.

235
00:17:14,812 --> 00:17:16,848
Looks like everything worked out.

236
00:17:17,054 --> 00:17:23,560
Yes. Yato's kid Regalia showing up like that was
a nice surprise. He fit into the plan perfectly.

237
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:26,135
Kazuma didn't get his name revoked...

238
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,372
But I would bet Bishamon won't use him again.

239
00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:33,327
So, does that mean it's time?

240
00:17:38,378 --> 00:17:40,442
You look like you're in a lot of pain.

241
00:17:41,164 --> 00:17:47,455
Yeah. Yukine's been depressed since it
happened. He won't even get out of bed.

242
00:17:48,087 --> 00:17:49,378
How is Kazuma?

243
00:17:49,522 --> 00:17:53,843
Fine, I think. He's got something
on his mind, but I don't know what.

244
00:17:54,729 --> 00:17:57,172
Poor guy. I wonder what'll happen to him.

245
00:17:57,601 --> 00:18:01,812
Actually, what about you? Isn't
your big advancement exam tomorrow?

246
00:18:02,052 --> 00:18:05,063
I've got a great idea! You
should pray to me you'll pass it!

247
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:08,993
Well, why not? It's only five yen.

248
00:18:11,354 --> 00:18:13,456
Hey. Need help with something?

249
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:13,910
Hm?

250
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,507
I'm one of Bishamon's Regalia. Aiha.

251
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,953
A scourged staff. Not the kind
of weapon you see every day.

252
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:27,790
Your master gives you some dangerous toys.

253
00:18:27,861 --> 00:18:31,739
Be quiet! You are my master's sworn enemy.

254
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,299
Everything I do here is for her!

255
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:36,576
Get away!

256
00:18:41,718 --> 00:18:43,412
Yato! Are you okay?

257
00:18:43,437 --> 00:18:48,272
Damn you, Bishamon! Sending a Regalia!
Did you lose it after throwing Kazuma out?

258
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:51,865
Let me help you out with this.

259
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:56,868
What the...? Hiyori! Really? Again!

260
00:18:56,893 --> 00:18:59,584
Hey! Stop! This is my fight!

261
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:09,240
There, you see?

262
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:13,133
She's been given a weapon. This
is nothing like fighting a Phantom!

263
00:19:14,331 --> 00:19:15,816
You let me handle this.

264
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:19,442
But you're not feeling so well, and Yukine isn't here.

265
00:19:21,254 --> 00:19:24,494
I can't use my Sekki now.
That's probably why she attacked.

266
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:27,456
Guess I'll ask.

267
00:19:38,668 --> 00:19:39,485
Hey!

268
00:19:41,345 --> 00:19:43,282
You wouldn't kill me! I'm a girl!

269
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:44,705
Like I care.

270
00:19:45,787 --> 00:19:48,582
Women and children are nothing special to a god.

271
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:54,596
Did you wait until I was alone to strike?
Did you think I would be helpless unarmed?

272
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:58,235
And the way you looked at me.
You really hate me, don't you?

273
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:01,343
You've heard all about how I killed your comrades...

274
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:03,137
Stop!

275
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:05,511
Yato! Don't follow...

276
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:11,472
A Phantom?

277
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:14,959
Smells nice.

278
00:20:14,984 --> 00:20:16,915
Great. Just what I need.

279
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:22,601
Smells nice... Smells nice...

280
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:24,202
There are so many of them!

281
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:26,351
Where'd they come from?

282
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:30,347
An ambush! Damn!

283
00:20:38,064 --> 00:20:39,716
All right. That's enough.

284
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:43,895
Hiyori. Hi there.

285
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:46,611
How are you today?

286
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:52,031
Those are Phantoms!

287
00:20:53,738 --> 00:20:55,312
Dr. Kuga! Hurry!

288
00:20:55,493 --> 00:20:59,918
Yes, yes. I'm coming. All this effort
will be for nothing should Yato return.

289
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,110
Kugaha! Aiha!

290
00:21:01,538 --> 00:21:02,379
Restraint!

291
00:21:06,328 --> 00:21:08,629
Ah! I'm glad to see you!

292
00:21:08,654 --> 00:21:09,639
Are you okay?

293
00:21:09,664 --> 00:21:11,602
Yes, but what are you doing here?

294
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:18,664
I still had some questions about Suzuha. So I
came looking for Yato. I never expected to find this!

295
00:21:19,173 --> 00:21:20,532
Where did you get this?

296
00:21:21,206 --> 00:21:23,248
Scourges corrode Regalia!

297
00:21:25,211 --> 00:21:30,170
You've used the names your master gave you to
employ Phantoms and interfere with the living world!

298
00:21:31,537 --> 00:21:38,138
Do you even realize how demeaning this is to our
master? A name is proof of a Regalia's humanity!

299
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,008
No! Restraint!

300
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,733
Kugaha! Restraint!

301
00:21:46,552 --> 00:21:47,791
You can't move!

302
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:49,730
Not when I've restrained your name!

303
00:21:50,271 --> 00:21:56,117
I was disappointed when she didn't get rid of
you entirely, but now I see it's worked in my favor.

304
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,098
Because if you were nameless, you
would be immune to my invocations.

305
00:22:01,498 --> 00:22:05,088
Kazuma. Slumber.

306
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:14,821
What are you going to do about this, Yato?

307
00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:16,454
Hey! Wake up!

308
00:22:16,478 --> 00:22:22,319
The human you cherish so much
has been taken from you by Bishamon.

309
00:23:55,654 --> 00:24:00,696
Organic daikon, dye-free
mouthwash, all-natural shampoo... Huh?

00:24:00,737 --> 00:24:01,891
What are you grinning for, Kofuku?

311
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:07,470
It's so sweet of you to do Kazu's shopping for
him, Daikoku! On the next Noragami Aragoto: "Wish."

312
00:24:07,495 --> 00:24:09,849
That's it! No more freeloaders!
