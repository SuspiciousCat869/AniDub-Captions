1
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,958
[laughing]

2
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:12,333
[MONOKUMA] Hey there,
kids, it's Monokuma!

3
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:13,750
Since your brains
have probably got

4
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,541
the storage capacity of a gnat,

5
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:18,500
I'm here to help make sure
everybody's up to speed!

6
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:22,208
That's right! It's time for
a filler-recap episode!

7
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,333
Kidding! We wouldn't
do that to ya!

8
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:27,000
This'll just be a quick
summary. Promise.

9
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,208
So basically, Naegi
pulled some strings

10
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,416
for the Remnants of Despair and
was brought before the leaders

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,708
of the Future Foundation
to answer for it.

12
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,458
No sooner had they all
gathered to discuss

13
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,416
their questionable
comrade's fate...

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,875
And wham-o!

15
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,500
A brand new Mutual
Killing Game began!

16
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,958
Board members started
droppin' like flies!

17
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:47,500
Some lucky mortician's gonna
make enough mulah to retire on!

18
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,083
In the midst of all this,

19
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,708
Munakata killed Chairman Tengan

20
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:53,583
and underwent a
startling transformation.

21
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:54,833
To make matters worse,

22
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:58,208
Naegi caught wind of
an ominous prophecy.

23
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,833
Before long, Glasses McDorkface,
excuse me, Togami,

24
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:05,916
showed up with reinforcements,
hoping to join in on the fun!

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,416
What now, you ask?
Anyone's guess, really!

26
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,375
So kick back, relax,
and enjoy the carnage!

27
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,125
Whoa! What the hell's goin' on?

28
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,166
Ah!

29
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:33,750
[HAGAKURE]
HQ!

30
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,791
They... They could
survive that, right?

31
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,541
Great, yeah. Earthquake. Sure.

32
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:48,958
[RURUKA groans]

33
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,458
Whatever.

34
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:52,958
The sooner I get outta here,
the sooner it won't matter.

35
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:02,916
[gasps]

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,458
What the shit?

37
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,583
I think we're far enough
from the danger now.

38
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:06,083
So remind me again why we
didn't go through the exit?

39
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,583
I mean it had to have
been a trap, right?

40
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,291
It certainly wasn't a way out.

41
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:15,625
[MITARAI] I had a feeling.
But how can you be so sure?

42
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,166
Well, to be fair, that
passage would've led us

43
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,875
to the building's exterior.

44
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:23,375
Technically. But we
couldn't have escaped.

45
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:26,541
Not with our lives.

46
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,416
We're under the ocean.

47
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,125
[MITARAI]
W-We're what?!

48
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:34,791
[KIRIGIRI] Trust me. This is not
the building we started in.

49
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:38,208
It's a carbon copy.
Identical in every way.

50
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,666
But directly beneath
the original.

51
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,208
[KIRIGIRI]
If you recall,

52
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,250
we were gassed in the conference
room when this began.

53
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,041
In all likelihood we were
moved while unconscious,

54
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,250
and deposited in the
room's underwater duplicate

55
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,500
so no one would suspect a thing.

56
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:58,708
But that's a ridiculous amount
of effort, and for what?

57
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:02,333
It becomes worthwhile
if the aim is to confuse.

58
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,375
Your disbelief is proof
the tactic works.

59
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:12,416
[KIRIGIRI] At first, I had my
doubts it was even possible.

60
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,250
But once we got our
bearings after waking up,

61
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:19,541
I noticed the mark on the door
from earlier had vanished.

62
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,791
Okay, but then why
put us in the ocean?

63
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,958
To keep outsiders from
intervening, I should think.

64
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,125
Yes, of course.

65
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,500
This all points to
the Vice Chairman.

66
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,958
He's been closely involved with
the building's construction

67
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,250
from the ground up.

68
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:39,208
He couldn't have
failed to notice.

69
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:43,875
It's only logical. Everything
about this situation favors him.

70
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:01,583
[USAMI] Switching to...
Elimination Mode!

71
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:13,250
[MUNAKATA] Despair has
taken everything from me.

72
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,708
No one else will suffer.

73
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:20,000
No one else will endure
what I've gone through.

74
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:24,875
Despair... will be eradicated.

75
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,541
[MUNAKATA]
This would appear to be its CPU.

76
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,875
The actions I've
taken are not wrong.

77
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:54,166
In the end, I shall become Hope.

78
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:05,625
Hey, hey. Looks like you got one
of the skeevy little bastards.

79
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,125
[JUZO]
What's the matter? Let's go.

80
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:18,875
[MUNAKATA] To that purpose,
no sacrifice is too dear.

81
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,833
[MITARAI]
I don't know what to say.

82
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,291
Can he really be the mastermind?

83
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,750
[KIRIGIRI] For now, let's just
find Naegi and the others.

84
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:35,333
Uh. Seriously? I, uh, can't
see how he'd help much.

85
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,000
I can understand why
you might think that.

86
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:43,208
Granted, Naegi might not seem
like much a first glance,

87
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,833
but when push comes to shove,

88
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,250
he's the strongest human
being I've ever known.

89
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,958
Bar none.

90
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:54,208
He's optimistic. He always
puts his friends first.

91
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,375
And he couldn't give up
if his life depended on it.

92
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,416
I believe in the man
with all my heart.

93
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,125
See, there was a time when...

94
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,500
...when if he hadn't
been around, I--

95
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,541
Hm?

96
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,500
[ASAHINA chuckles]

97
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,708
[KIRIGIRI clears throat]

98
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,666
[NAEGI]
Wow. Under the sea, huh?

99
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,708
Somebody went to
a lotta trouble.

100
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,041
[KIRIGIRI]
Evidently.

101
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,500
You said Togami was en
route with reinforcements?

102
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,791
[NAEGI]
Mhm.

103
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,000
It's been long enough now

104
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,958
that he should be at
the real HQ as we speak.

105
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:48,333
What if there's traps?
What if Togami's hurt?

106
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,583
Oh, God. It'd be all my fault.

107
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,583
What do you mean?

108
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,666
I was told...

109
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,250
...someone would die,
all because of me.

110
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,291
Don't start down that path.

111
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,833
Why would you think that?
Did Munakata say something?

112
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,791
You know, up until now,

113
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:10,500
I was confident I could be
useful in any situation.

114
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:15,083
Here though, I'm sunk.
There's nothing I can do.

115
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,458
Munakata was right.

116
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:21,250
My words don't carry any
real weight. I'm just--

117
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,166
[KIRIGIRI]
Letting him get to you.

118
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,791
[KIRIGIRI]
Your words lift people up.

119
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:33,041
Give them something
to pin their hopes on.

120
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,458
That's certainly what
they've done for me.

121
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,750
Have faith in yourself, Naegi.

122
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:44,000
We need your words.
We need your optimism.

123
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,291
Your hope is infectious.

124
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:51,083
If ever you lose sight of
yourself, just look to us.

125
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,791
We'll remind you who you are.

126
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,958
It's the least we can do.

127
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:58,916
[ASAHINA chuckles]

128
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,000
Those wounds don't look so hot.

129
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,375
We should find you
a first aid kit.

130
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,333
[JUZO]
Hey, so...

131
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,291
What's on your mind?

132
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:24,166
Well, uh. Kimura's been killed.

133
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:29,041
Izayoi got poisoned, too.
Oh, along with Kizakura.

134
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,041
I-- I just thought
you ought to know.

135
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,583
[MUNAKATA]
Tengan as well.

136
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,000
Uh?

137
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,875
No joke?

138
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,916
I killed him myself.

139
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,083
Right. Sure.

140
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,208
Hey, that's good! This is
what we wanted, isn't it?

141
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,541
Purify the Foundation.

142
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,458
Heh. About damn time.

143
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,000
This baby's in your
hands now, chief.

144
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,125
You've been promoted.

145
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,000
No one in their right
mind's gonna contest it.

146
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:07,166
The revolution's over! And
the spoils of war are all yours!

147
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,541
I'll help, of course.

148
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,875
We're gonna fix the
Future Foundation.

149
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,125
After that, the world!

150
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,291
[MUNAKATA]
The world, you say?

151
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:23,083
Hey, Sakakura. We go back.

152
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,333
You've been at my side
for years, in fact;

153
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,083
since we were students.

154
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,416
Uh, yeah.

155
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,541
We had our share of good times.

156
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:35,416
The two of us, and
Yukizome, of course.

157
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,416
Eyes always on the future.

158
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,250
Three friends intimately bound
