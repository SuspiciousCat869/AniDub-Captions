00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:12,458
[MONAKA] The Junko Enoshima
you worshipped is no more!

2
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:15,041
And why?

3
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:18,041
Because of that poopie-head,
Makoto Naegi!

00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,416
[MONAKA crying]

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,875
[MONAKA]
Despair lost.

6
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,833
Hope mopped the floor
with our collective butts.

7
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:29,041
How sad is that? Like,
really, really, really sad!

8
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:32,333
The worst thing ever!
You don't even know!

9
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:35,541
[wailing]

10
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,166
[MONAKA] Shut up!
You're next on the hit list!

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,250
Hope has its sights trained
and its finger on the trigger!

12
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,458
But take heart,
my beloved Monokumas,

13
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:47,333
it ain't over till
the fat lady screams!

14
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh, yes! Your Monaka
is still here!

15
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,875
And as the heir of big sis
Junko's Despair factor,

16
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,500
I shall continue her legacy!

17
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:01,375
Because a world brimming with
hope is unbelievably drab.

18
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:02,916
Oh, God.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,125
People must come to know the joy
of raw, unmitigated Despair.

20
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:11,416
I, Junko Enoshima the 2nd,
aka Monaka Towa,

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,708
will stem the tide!

22
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,708
Just you wait!

23
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,000
The Future Foundation,

24
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:20,416
all humanity will drown
in a sea of desolation!

25
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,041
[NAGISA]
Yes, that's right.

26
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,916
She's commandeered a building
on the outskirts of town.

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,666
Kind of a lair. Careful.

28
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,666
Apparently the place is guarded
by an army of Monokumas.

29
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,458
I hate to say it,
but our hands are tied.

30
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,583
We don't have the manpower.

31
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:17,208
Unfortunately, getting
in there is up to you.

32
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,791
My apologies.

33
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,208
Stay sharp.

34
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,833
Monaka Towa is setting herself
up to be the next Junko.

35
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:27,166
And she's every bit as
intelligent as Enoshima.

36
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,041
If she's still trying
to plan something,

37
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,583
whatever it is, shut her down.

38
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:36,250
Just... promise me you'll try
not to be so hard on the girl.

39
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,666
She's a friend.
At least, she used to be.

40
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,666
[KOMARU]
I know, Shingetsu. Sorry.

Will you slow down for a second?

I'm a book nerd!
Running isn't my thing! Ugh!

[KOMARU]
My name is Komaru Naegi.

46
00:03:56,666 --> 00:04:01,458
Hope is not my thing.
Neither is Despair.

47
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,875
I'm just a normal high school
girl, like you'd find anywhere.

I survived.

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,958
But got separated
from my family.

Fukawa, my darling.

to describe your beauty.

Oh, stop it.

more beautiful than me.

Perhaps I'm lost in
your eyes, perhaps not.

Perhaps I should put
you in handcuffs.

Please, Master, take me skiing.

Oh. Pay her no mind.

I don't believe I've
ever met someone

118
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,458
whose plainness so
utterly defies explanation.

You're gonna make me blush.

[TOGAMI]
I don't care. Say yes!

00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,791
I'll go lay out fresh clothes
for Madam. Don't mind me, guys.

128
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,708
[AGENT A]
Everything all right, sir?

129
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,458
You seem uncomfortable?

130
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,583
Yes.

131
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,666
I was just struck by
the uncanny sense

132
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,583
that a certain someone
is fantasizing

133
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,791
well beyond the scope
of her station.

134
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,916
I'm fine. Continue the report.

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,250
Sir.

136
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,291
In accordance with
our earlier findings,

137
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,791
none of the other branches are
registering Remnant activity.

138
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:54,125
Nor is the situation in the
facility being broadcast.

139
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,791
If the Remnants
of Despair intend

140
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:59,958
for Foundation brass to kill one
another, as Naegi maintains,

141
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,916
broadcasting it would
be an essential part

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,875
of their broader objective.

143
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,708
And yet, so far,
no other divisions report

144
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:10,958
the slightest indication
of Remnant activity.

145
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,875
This new Killing Game
has to be a means

146
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,791
to a far more nefarious end.

147
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,250
What the devil are
they playing at?

148
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,750
Attention, all agents.

149
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,208
As I speak, the leaders
of the Future Foundation

150
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,083
are under a clear
and present threat.

151
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,875
There is no time to waste.

152
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,875
Let's show the enemy
what we're capable of.

153
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,375
Do not fret.

154
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,916
As long as I draw breath,
this organization will not fall.

155
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,166
This I swear by the dignity
of the Togami name.

156
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,958
[KOMARU] Something tells me
this might be her hideout.

157
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,083
Way to be subtle about it, huh?

158
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,666
I thought the brat was supposed
to be hyper intelligent.

159
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,333
But I'm starting to think
she's an imbecile.

160
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,958
I mean, seriously.
Who does that?

161
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,166
[KOMARU]
Right?

162
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,250
'Kay. Well, we're here so...

163
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:16,083
I cannot fail.
Here goes nothing!

164
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,208
Let's take the slut
down in record time

165
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,375
so I can get back to bumpin'
uglies with Master Sweetcheeks!

166
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:25,458
Mr. Stork, you're about to put
in some serious overtime!

167
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,958
[laughing]

168
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,291
[MONAKA laughing]

169
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,375
[MONAKA]
Oh my God, finally.

170
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,583
Ew! Nobody needs to
see your friendship

171
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,041
hanging out all over the place!

172
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,500
We get it. Together you
can brave anything.

173
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:42,791
Blah, blah, blah.

174
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,083
You're just pooling
your lunch money

175
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,416
to buy last week's
lottery ticket.

176
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,458
Why doesn't anyone understand
how wonderful Despair is?

177
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,833
Are they that blind?

178
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,833
Ugh. It really breaks
my heart, you know?

179
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,833
Like, I'm in tears right now.

180
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,791
[MONAKA cries]

181
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,291
[MONAKA}
It's not fair.

182
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,208
Maybe Despair's not trendy
with Junko out of the picture.

183
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,875
Maybe-- Maybe
Monoka isn't trendy!

184
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,791
Maybe the world doesn't
want me anymore!

185
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,333
Oh, well!

186
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,083
Meh. It's not like I can't blow
this popsicle stand, right?

187
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:14,250
Time for me to leave
the world, or destroy it.

188
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,875
Yep! Those are my options!

189
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,791
And the best part?
It's not a difficult choice.

190
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:25,708
[MONAKA giggling]

191
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,125
I don't even know
how we did that.

192
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,083
I haven't taken out that
many Monokuma's in forever.

193
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,916
I just need a minute here.

194
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,166
Ugh, my breath!

195
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,208
[KOMARU]
Yeah, it stinks.

196
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,625
No, you jerk,
I need to catch it!

197
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,083
[KOMARU]
Uh-huh.

198
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,750
Definitely looks like she's
got something in the works.

199
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,291
[FUKAWA]
Stupid little brat.

200
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,625
She's been so quiet lately I
thought we were done with her.

201
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,875
What on earth is she up to now?

202
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:56,916
[BOTH gasp]

203
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,416
[MONAKA] Hello there, girls!
Welcome to the party!

204
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,875
I'm so glad you made it.
And I sure ain't kitten!

205
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,375
Wh-What are you trying to do?

206
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,125
[chuckles]

207
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,458
Do you think you're dumb?

208
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,625
Consider yourself
painfully average?

209
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,125
Having trouble
deciding what side

210
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,500
of the Hope/Despair
fence you're on?

211
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,750
Well, honey, put all
the mess behind you!

212
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,416
Monaka Towa is here to take Hope

213
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,458
completely and utterly
out of the equation!

214
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,708
Impossible! You're insane!

215
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:33,000
So you're behind what's going
on at Foundation Headquarters?

216
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,000
I, the great Monaka Towa,

217
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,333
true heir to Junko
Enoshima's legacy,

218
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,041
am the only one who could
ever hope to bring Naegi

219
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,125
to the deplorable depths
of deadly Despair!

220
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,458
Ah. Of course.

221
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,500
I thought that hairstyle
looked oddly familiar.

222
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,041
I owe the man a debt.

223
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,791
Because of him, I'm more Junko
Enoshima than the original!

224
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,791
Can you believe it?
She'd be so proud!

225
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,916
You're not gonna lay
a hand on my brother!

226
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,416
[laughs]

227
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,416
Sorry, sweetheart.
Home field advantage!

228
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,458
[FUKAWA]
Look out!

229
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,125
There's even more
here than outside.

230
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:16,416
Oh, God. Just fight
for as long as you can.

231
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,833
Fine. I surrender.

232
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,166
[BOTH]
Huh?

233
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,666
[MONAKA] Did I stutter?
I said I surrender.

234
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,000
Lemme make sure
I get this straight.

235
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,291
You're backing down? That's it?

236
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:48,958
Yup. If we rumble, it's a
forgone conclusion I'd lose.

237
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,291
Hope is just way too
stubborn to die.

238
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,291
Despair can win the battle,
but never the war.

239
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,666
[sighs]

240
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,708
[MONAKA] Don't you see?
I was hoping to defeat you.

241
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,375
Irony.

242
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,208
I'm done. Monoka out.

243
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,416
[BOTH gasp]

244
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:44,375
Uh... What the hell is this?

245
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:48,500
Ugh. My room. What's it
look like? Come on.

246
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,958
[FUKAWA]
Good lord, it's a pigsty!

247
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,875
Damn! And if you're sayin'
that, you know it's bad.

248
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,916
Ha-ha. You're hilarious.

249
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,125
So, uh, what happens now?

250
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,666
I thought you were all about
your wannabe-big sister's legacy

251
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,958
and becoming the Super High
School-Level Despair.

252
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,541
[MONAKA]
Yeah, no.

253
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,291
That was this whole phase I was
going though. I'm over it now.

254
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,208
Let's pretend it never happened.

255
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,458
Well that's good.

256
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,791
But we're still gonna
need some information.

257
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,750
[MONAKA]
Ugh. I don't know anything.

258
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,291
Whoever's behind the Mutual
Killing Game, it's not me.

259
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,875
That tactic is so
cliché nowadays.

260
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,833
Frankly I've got better
things to do with my time.

261
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,291
Huh?

262
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,166
But if you're not the
mastermind, what are you doing?

263
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,916
[MONAKA] Um, I suppose
you can call me a lurker.

264
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,291
Is that a thing?

265
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:36,208
Sadly, yes. She's just
been watching.

266
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,875
[MONAKA] I wanted to see this
Makoto Naegi guy up close,

267
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,083
that's all.

268
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,458
I might've had a little fun with
ketchup for old time's sake.

269
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,291
Heh. Nothing major.

270
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,625
Nothing major?

271
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,458
You murdered Gekkogahara
for crying out loud!

272
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,583
[MONAKA]
Oh, yeah.

273
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,000
Well, apart from that,
nothing major.

274
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,583
Um. What made you this way?

275
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,458
You had to have been
normal once. You're a kid.

276
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,875
How'd you get to be such a lousy
excuse for a human being?

277
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,750
[MONAKA]
There was this person.

278
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,916
Kinda turned me into
an adult way too soon.

279
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,500
[KOMARU]
Wait.

280
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,791
[FUKAWA]
What?

281
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,666
[MONAKA] I used to listen
to him go on and on

282
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,250
about Hope and Despair
and yadda, yadda, yadda.

283
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,375
Not someone I really
wanna end up like.

284
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,833
[FUKAWA, KOMARU]
Uh...

285
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,291
[MONAKA]
So I'm done.

286
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,958
Total indifference is
Monoka's thing now.

287
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,333
Then who's behind this?

288
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,750
Tell us who's attacking
my brother and the others!

289
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,500
Sorry. No idea.

290
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:39,208
'Course there is one
thing I could tell you.

291
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,541
[chuckles]

292
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,458
Makoto Naegi is in for
the shock of his life.

293
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,375
And he doesn't even know
that because of him,

294
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,458
one of the survivors
from big sis' game

295
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,208
is gonna bite the big one!

296
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,416
[gasps]

297
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,833
Uh?

298
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,375
[MONAKA] Monaka knows who,
but she's too lazy to say.

299
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,083
Guess I'm just a lousy
excuse for a human being.

300
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,916
What? No, please!
You have to tell us!

301
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,125
[MONAKA]
Leave me alone. Google it. Jeez.

302
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,458
[KOMARU]
Don't make me hurt you!

303
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,166
Oh, I see how it is.

304
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,791
You want us to believe
you're indifferent,

305
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,291
but you're still on
the side of Despair.

306
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,916
[MONAKA] E for effort,
but I'm not biting.

307
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,833
[SHO] You have the rest of
your life to 'fess up, bitch!

308
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,125
I'm the sort of gal who
reads mystery novels

309
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,000
by skipping to the end!

310
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,625
[MONAKA] You're really worried
about Naegi, aren't you?

311
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:27,833
[SHO]
Hell, no!

312
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,458
I just don't like loose
ends! Now spill it!

313
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,583
[MONAKA] Ugh. You didn't
hear it from me, okay?

314
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,750
The victim will be--

315
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,000
Agh! That does it!
She dies now!

316
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,291
[KOMARU]
No, stop! You can't!

317
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,541
Let go of me, DeKomaru!

318
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,750
We promised not to go too
hard on her! Remember?

319
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,125
[BOTH gasp]

320
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,875
[MONAKA] It's been fun, ladies,
but this is goodbye.

321
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,875
Best of luck!

322
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,416
You're... leaving?

323
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,833
I'm setting a course
for the Final Frontier.

324
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:08,750
Outer Space! Where I'm
never leaving my room! He!

325
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,875
You-You've gotta be kidding!

326
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:27,125
Tramp! We're not done!
You ain't goin' nowhere!

327
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,875
[KOMARU]
Wait! What're you doing?

328
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,416
Tell me! Which of us from
the old gang's gonna die?

329
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,916
[KOMARU]
Touko!

330
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,791
Forget it! She won't talk!

331
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:43,041
If we don't get down now,
we won't be able to!

332
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,791
'S okay. Don't worry about me.
Just get outta here!

333
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,708
[KOMARU]
Screw that!

334
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:51,583
We're in this together!
I'm not leaving you!

335
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:55,291
Let's go. We need
to jump now! C'mon.

336
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,333
You wanna see Togami
again, don't you?

337
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,333
That's a low blow.

338
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,291
Touko, please!

339
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,125
[MONAKA]
Hope. Despair.

340
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,250
Hope. Despair.

341
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,708
You'd think with
only two options

342
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:24,791
it'd be a fairly
straightforward choice, right?

343
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,166
Too complicated!

344
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,875
Monoka is shutting her brain
off permanently! Woohoo!

345
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,916
No more thinking!

346
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,375
There!

347
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,958
Heads up, we're comin' in hot!

348
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,625
[KOMARU]
You all right? Talk to me.

349
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:09,875
[FUKAWA groans]

350
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,916
[FUKAWA] Do I even wanna
know what's going on,

351
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,583
or was that the world
somersaulting?

352
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,583
Ugh. I'm gonna puke.

353
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:20,166
Uh? What? What's with that look?

354
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,291
Sorry, I'm just...
I'm just so--

355
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,791
What would I have done if
something happened to you?

356
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,416
[FUKAWA]
Uh.

357
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,625
Hey, thanks for talking
me down. I needed that.

358
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,125
[KOMARU]
Sure.

359
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,500
[KOMARU]
Unbelievable.

360
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,458
You think she's really
going into space?

361
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,958
[FUKAWA]
Who knows...

362
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,291
Anything's possible.

363
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,541
Shame someone with her
IQ chooses to waste away

364
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,125
in her room though.

365
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,083
I have a feeling
she'll change her mind

366
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,083
once she's grown up a little.

367
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,666
All she needs, really.

368
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,958
Give her a little time to mature
and she'll be back before long.

369
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,875
[FUKAWA]
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

370
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,375
she can stay up there.

371
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,250
So now what?

372
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,500
Kinda strange for
Togami to be late, isn't it?

373
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:14,375
[whirring]

374
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,833
Miss Gekkogahara?

375
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,583
Are you feeling okay?

376
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,208
[USAMI]
Big brother!

377
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,541
Huh?

378
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:26,375
[USAMI]
Makoto? Come in! Are you there?

379
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,958
Listen to me very carefully.

380
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:31,000
The person in front of
you right now isn't real.

381
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,416
Quite a twist, huh?

382
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,708
What is going on?

383
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,041
Hold on a minute,

384
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,833
you never said Gekkogahara
was your little sister!

385
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,250
What? No!
She's not. I-I don't--

386
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,541
[FUKAWA]
I think we're patched in.

387
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,208
Okay. I'll get in touch
with Master Byakuya.

388
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,291
You talk to your brother.
Tell him what she said.

389
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,791
Right.

390
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,166
Nice, we got video.

391
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,958
Hey, big brother!
Can you see me?

392
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:55,750
Hey, Komaru! Lookin'
good there, sis! Ha!

393
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:59,625
Wait a second. Why are you
inside...? What's going on?

394
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,541
So, yeah, um--

395
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,916
We just got some pretty
bad news actually.

396
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,083
Listen to me.

397
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,500
Monaka's not behind this,

398
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,708
but she did tell us someone's
gonna die 'cause of you!

399
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,458
Brace yourself.

400
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,000
She said it'll be somebody
from the first game.

401
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,125
One of the survivors from
Hope's Peak High School

402
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,750
won't make it out
of there alive.

403
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,583
But how could she know that?

404
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,583
It just doesn't make
any sense at all!

405
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,625
[KOMARU] I wish I knew
more, I really do.

406
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,208
All I can say is Monoka told us

407
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,416
like it was something
she knew for a fact.

408
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,833
I-I'm sorry. It might
be a trick, but still!

409
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:37,916
[TOGAMI]
Nonsense!

410
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,083
That's the most preposterous
thing I've ever heard!

411
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,583
One of us killed? Absurd!

412
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,625
Hagakure, Togami, and
Fukawa are all outside,

413
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:51,041
so it's a safe bet she wasn't
talking about one of them.

414
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,583
Somebody's gonna die...

415
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,541
...because of me.

416
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,750
[thud]

417
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:06,875
What?
