1
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:37,208
[TENGAN] Ladies and gentlemen,
Hope's Peak has been liberated.

2
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:40,125
And why are rescue
teams not on the scene?

3
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,458
[OPERATOR A] First responders
just arrived, sir.

4
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:48,666
So... Junko Enoshima.

5
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,083
[YUKIZOME]
I, uh...

6
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,625
I'm sorry. This is my fault.

7
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:58,541
I was sure she wasn't
behind all this.

8
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:03,666
I won't tell you not
to let it sting.

9
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,791
That said, this just goes to
show how formidable she was.

10
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,125
[YUKIZOME]
Kyosuke.

11
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,083
[growls]

12
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,125
[TENGAN]
Finally, the door is open.

13
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,958
[MUNAKATA]
So you, of all people,

14
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,416
figured out who the Attacker is.

15
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,375
Munakata, please.

16
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:00,583
We owe it to her to listen.
Where's the harm in that?

17
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,750
Start talking.

18
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,250
Go on.

19
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,833
Right, yes.

20
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,916
Well, these are all the
notes Kyoko had made

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,708
up to this point, and...

22
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,750
Yeah. There. Have a look.

23
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:27,625
[NAEGI] "The only latent prints
found at any of the crime scenes

24
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,083
have been from the
victims themselves.

25
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,166
Stab wounds are situated in
easily accessible areas

26
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,875
of the body.

27
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,666
In other words..."

28
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,625
Suicide?

29
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:42,083
"...is the only logical
conclusion that fits the facts."

30
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,666
She can't've been serious!

31
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,458
You see? Nobody was
actually murdered.

32
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:50,166
That's insanity! Why would
they've killed themselves?

33
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,875
What could possibly have
pushed them over the edge?

34
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,750
Let me see that for a minute.

35
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,875
[NAEGI] She made a map
of the rooms showing

36
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:04,000
where the victims were found,
where the survivors stayed,

37
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,458
and the monitors.

38
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,208
[ASAHINA] So you think there's
some kind of connection?

39
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,291
[NAEGI]
Uh...

40
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:15,375
Now that you mention it,
there has to be.

41
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:19,875
One was there.
One was there.

42
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:23,458
In fact, I think that's true
of every crime scene.

43
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,166
Yeah, whenever we
found a victim,

44
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,333
there was always a monitor.

45
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:34,333
Of course, that doesn't explain
the role they played.

46
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,833
Hmm...

47
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,875
All right, Munakata.

48
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,625
I have a proposition.

49
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,125
[ASAHINA]
I'd like to go on record

50
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,291
saying this is a terrible idea.

51
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,291
I get what you're doing,

52
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,666
but if you're right,
you're dead!

53
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,458
It'll all be fine, Asahina.

54
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,625
Why else do you think I'd have
Munakata tie me up like this?

55
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,125
Still not the most
foolproof plan.

56
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,416
Hey, guys, we're almost
at the, uh, time limit.

57
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,791
Look, whatever you
expect to get out of this,

58
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,125
just swear to me Kyoko's death
hasn't pushed you past

59
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,833
some kind of breaking
point, okay?

60
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,833
[chuckles]

61
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,166
She'd be pissed at me if it had.

62
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,083
I would never dishonor
her memory like that.

63
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,333
She looked for the truth.

64
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,250
Nothing kept her from searching.

65
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,125
She held out hope
till the bitter end.

66
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,541
After all, if she could do it,

67
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,291
then I'd darn-well
better, right?

68
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,958
And plus...

69
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,083
What?

70
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,750
I made a promise to
my little sister.

71
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,875
I told her I'd come and get
her once this was all over.

72
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,500
[NAEGI]
So, yeah.

73
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,708
I intend to be a survivor.

74
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:19,708
[music plays]

75
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,166
[MUNAKATA]
Suicide.

76
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,791
But if he's just
grasping at straws...

77
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,291
[ASAHINA]
Naegi.

78
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:53,791
[beeping]

79
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,500
[MONOKUMA]
Top o' the morning to ya!

80
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,833
Wakey-wakey, eggs and bakey!

81
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:10,416
Attacker! Come out,
come out wherever you are!

82
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,375
Yep, it's time to work
your bloody magic.

83
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,458
Who shall be the
target for today?

84
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:22,458
Ah! Well bust my buttons,
it's you! "What? There must..."

85
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,000
That's how it's done.

86
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:28,166
The bangles. They wake you up
when you're near a monitor.

87
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,583
What's going on?
What are you planning?

88
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,541
[MONOKUMA] ... what everyone
in your position says.

89
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,791
C'mon. Being the
Attacker ain't that bad.

90
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,916
Get-Get-Get this!
Believe it or not...

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,375
This isn't live.
It's a recording.

92
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:45,166
[MONOKUMA] Hm? Eager to
find out what it is?

93
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,166
Sure you are. That's
what I like about you.

94
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,666
Now, pay close attention.

95
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:02,750
[music playing]

96
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,208
Naegi.

97
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,583
[KIRIGIRI]
You're still alive.

00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,666
Naegi.

[NAEGI gasps]

100
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,666
You're such a liar.

101
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,541
Remember you swore to get me
out alive? What happened there?

102
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,916
[KIRIGIRI]
This is all your fault.

103
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,541
B-But I--!

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,333
I'm sorry. I don't
understand why you're--

105
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,875
Why are you still alive, Naegi?

106
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,458
Yeah, right? You're the
one who deserves to die.

107
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,750
[KIRIGIRI, MAIZONO]
Naegi.

108
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:44,500
It should've been you who
was killed instead of us.

109
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,750
[NAEGI]
But I--

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,958
[NAEGI] I-I just wanted
everyone to be...

[NAEGI]
To be...

112

[NAEGI]
No. Wait. Please!

[screaming]

00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,916
That's the way. Join us, Naegi.

116
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,666
Yes, yes. Join us.

117
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,791
[BOTH]
Do it, Naegi!

118
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:54,458
Sure. On my way.

119
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,500
[thud]

120
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,708
[NAEGI]
Uh...?

121
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:10,500
[JUZO] You're the man who
defeated Junko Enoshima.

122
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,208
If you think I'm gonna
let you kill yourself,

123
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,458
you're dumber than you look!

124
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,333
Hear me, ya little punk?

125
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,500
Not now. Not ever!

126
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,000
How are you even--?

127
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:45,125
You wanna die so bad, allow me.

128
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,583
[clatter]

129
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,333
[JUZO]
Damn it.

130
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,958
[NAEGI]
How-How are you still awake?

131
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:58,875
[NAEGI gasps]

132
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,833
[NAEGI]
You cut off your arm?

133
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,208
That's one way, I guess.

134
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,625
[JUZO] Figured I could make
the scene before it happened.

135
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,875
I could meet whoever's behind

136
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:14,250
this God-forsaken
game face-to-face.

137
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,916
Take the Attacker
and be done with it.

138
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:27,291
[NAEGI] There is no Attacker.
There never was.

139
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,750
Huh?

140
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,125
[NAEGI]
It was suicide.

141
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,083
The victims, they
were all brainwashed

142
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,916
into killing themselves by what
they saw on the monitors.

143
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,583
[NAEGI]
When the time limit was up,

144
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,166
we were all knocked unconscious.

145
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,916
But whoever was closest
to a monitor got woken up

146
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,916
by a special signal
from their bangles.

147
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:01,458
[NAEGI] Awake and alone, they
were subjected to a video.

148
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,208
After that...

149
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,791
Who did this?

150
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:34,333
What sicko piece of shit
thinks this is entertaining?

151
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:37,791
That I don't know.
At least not yet.

152
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:41,041
But they wouldn't even have
to be here for it to work.

153
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,500
What are you tellin' me?

154
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:46,166
They could've set this up?
Controlled it remotely?

155
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,500
Probably.

156
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,958
On the bright side,

157
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:52,416
at least we don't have to
suspect each other anymore.

158
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:59,875
[JUZO chuckling]

159
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,708
What are we supposed to do now?
It's all a shell game.

160
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:07,166
We've been manipulated from
some unknown other place.

161
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,291
Killing each other like
a bunch of animals.

162
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:14,958
Yukizome. Gozu. Kimura.

163
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,708
Some video brainwashed 'em
into taking their own lives?

164
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,083
All the horrible things we've
done to smoke out the killer

165
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,458
and it's been us.

166
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,291
Son of a bitch!

167
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,833
What are you doing?

168
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,583
Let's end this game.

169
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,875
If we destroy all the monitors,
that should do it.

170
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,291
[JUZO]
Heh.

171
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:51,791
You got any idea how many
of those things there are?

172
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,041
[NAEGI]
Uh... But--

173
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,958
[JUZO]
Don't let me stop you.

174
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,458
Just don't expect me
to help either.

175
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:08,833
[JUZO] True story.
I wanted you to die.

176
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,250
Heh. I'd have gladly
done it myself.

177
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,333
See, I'm not a man who
can forgive and forget.

178
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,708
I hated you.

179
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,208
No, from the moment
you walked out

180
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,375
of Hope's Peak High School
alive, I loathed you.

181
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,750
Despised you.

182
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:27,833
So I'm not gonna lie,
when Munakata told you

183
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:32,375
to kill yourself, I thought,
"It's about damn time."

184
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:37,125
But why? I don't...

185
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:42,750
[JUZO] Because... you defeated
Junko Enoshima.

186
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:46,750
Yeah, 's right. Bitch
played me like a fiddle.

187
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,916
I knew she was up to something
and I kept my mouth shut.

188
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,166
I had one job and I botched it.

189
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,875
This is the result.
It's all on me.

190
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,333
I couldn't stop everyone dying.

191
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,916
I couldn't kill you
for Munakata.

192
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,833
And in the end,
he threw me away.

193
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,625
Like an old pair of boots.

194
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,541
[NAEGI]
He was wrong.

195
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,541
It's the game!

196
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,166
The man was fooled
into believing

197
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,250
you'd gone over to the enemy!

198
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,916
[JUZO]
No kidding.

199
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,666
Oh snap! Kyoko's
theory was bang-on!

200
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,208
I don't believe it.

201
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,375
Everyone really was forced
to kill themselves.

202
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,541
[ASAHINA]
Okay, but by who?

203
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,833
[MUNAKATA]
There's only one possibility.

204
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,125
Apart from me, there's
only one human being

205
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,291
capable of altering this
facility's machinery,

206
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,500
who knows it like
the back of his hand.

207
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,333
He warned me.

208
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,875
Told me that in a
manner of speaking

209
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,083
the Attacker was all of us.

210
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,000
I refused to believe him.

211
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,500
He built the Foundation
from the ground up.

212
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,833
In fact, he was the former
principal of Hope's Peak.

213
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,833
Kazuo Tengan.

214
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,875
[ASAHINA]
Oh, that can't be right!

215
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,291
[MUNAKATA] We've established
that those closest to a monitor

216
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:33,625
when the time limit ran out were
compelled to commit suicide.

217
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:34,958
Tengan's Forbidden Action

218
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,625
was answering a
question with a lie.

219
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,458
And since any of us could
potentially become the Attacker,

220
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,291
he told me the truth.

221
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,333
But... Oh my God.

222
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:48,250
Why would Chairman Tengan
want us all to kill each other?

223
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,583
[MUNAKATA]
Is it not perfectly obvious?

224
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,125
Kazuo Tengan...

225
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,291
...was the true
Remnant of Despair.

226
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,083
No way!

227
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,583
That can't be the answer!

228
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,083
He was the Foundation's
leader for God's sake!

229
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,375
How could--? How could
he do such a thing?

230
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:09,000
[MUNAKATA] Who knows?
But he's the only solution.

231
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:14,416
Naegi. Have I told you?

232
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,583
Chisa Yukizome was with
the Remnants as well.

233
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,708
No.

234
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,416
But she was my teacher.

235
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,000
[MUNAKATA]
I know.

236
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:27,000
She was part of an undercover
investigation into Hope's Peak

237
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,916
while you were there.

238
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,916
Everything we could find,
every shred of evidence,

239
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,041
every possible lead pointed
directly at Junko Enoshima.

240
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:43,625
And yet, Yukizome and Sakakura
both insisted on her innocence.

241
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,833
Foolishly, I took
them at their word.

242
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,708
[MUNAKATA]
Worst mistake of my life.

243
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,291
[MUNAKATA
They were my friends,

244
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,916
and Tengan took
advantage of that.

245
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,208
I didn't know.

246
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:21,000
Well damn. Guess I'm a Despair.

247
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,000
Huh. Wish I could
find the humor in--

248
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:35,041
[JUZO] This is what I get for
letting Enoshima off the hook.

249
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,666
[JUZO] Always been
too much of a softie.

250
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,291
'Least that's what
they'll say about me.

251
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,750
Okay, what's happening?

252
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,500
[NAEGI]
Those are the emergency lights.

253
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,958
Naegi, take a look!

254
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,958
I think the monitors
are offline.

255
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,708
The power's been shut off!

256
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,041
[NAEGI]
But by who?

257
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,416
[gasps]

258
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Sakakura!

259
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,041
He must be in
the breaker room!

260
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,958
From there, he can cut off
power to the entire building!

261
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,583
[NAEGI]
You think he'd do that?

262
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,166
I don't like this, guys.

263
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,541
Something tells me we should've
found the breaker room first.

264
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,458
Munakata, please.

265
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,916
He's out there trying
to save you. Go to him.

266
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,791
He's not the enemy!

267
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,333
Even if you're right...

268
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,208
...I ran him through
and left him to die.

269
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,750
He was my... my friend.

270
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,208
Is your friend!

271
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,333
If he didn't believe in you,
he wouldn't be doing this!

272
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,291
Please! You have
to let him know!

273
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,500
Look around you.
The power's been cut off.

274
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,666
He's shutting down
the game. All for you!

275
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,791
I deserve what you
did to me. I get it.

276
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,583
And damn it all,
I want you to live!

277
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:48,250
[beeping]

278
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,416
The arm bangles!

279
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:09,458
Mu... na... ka... ta.

280
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:05,708
Forgive me...

281
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,000
Seems I'm always....

282
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,625
...always too late.

283
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,625
[AGENT E] Do we have confirmed
survivors, or don't we?

284
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,166
[AGENT B] If you can hear me,
try to make a noise!

285
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,583
[AGENT C]
A few are hangin' on!

286
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,458
[AGENT D] I need a
stretcher over here now!

287
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,833
Save the Advance Team, damn it!

288
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,791
Blast! What the holy
hell is going on?

289
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:49,375
So, Mitarai.

290
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,291
The video I saw,

291
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,041
it was able to
brainwash a person

292
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:56,250
into actually
killing themselves.

293
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,208
Think it's fair to assume
that's not something

294
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:00,375
a normal person could make?

295
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:02,791
[MITARAI]
Wait...

296
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:05,208
[NAEGI]
I mean, seriously,

297
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:07,916
I wouldn't even know
where to begin.

298
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,833
You're the former Super High
School-Level Animator.

299
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:12,791
Do you know anything about it?

300
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:20,291
I-I'm sorry.
But it wasn't me.

301
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,208
No, I wasn't accusing you--

302
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,291
Blame Junko Enoshima!

303
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,416
She used my technology!

304
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,333
Junko Enoshima?

305
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,166
[ASAHINA]
What are you talking about?

306
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,458
[phone ringing]

307
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,458
[MITARAI]
It's Tengan.
