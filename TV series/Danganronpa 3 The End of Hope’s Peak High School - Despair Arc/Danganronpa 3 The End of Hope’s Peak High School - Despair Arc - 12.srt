1
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,083
[YUKIZOME]
Pardon me, sir.

2
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:26,666
Hello, Yukizome. Somethin' up?

3
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,500
What'cha got there?

4
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:33,375
[YUKIZOME] The video responsible
for the Biggest, Most Atrocious,

5
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:36,791
Despair-Inducing
Incident in Human History.

6
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:39,416
Brainwashing, yes.

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,666
[YUKIZOME] It just so happens
the technology was developed

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,625
by a former student of mine.

9
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,416
One Ryota Mitarai.

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,041
If we can track him down,

11
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:50,875
he might prove to be a valuable
asset against the enemy.

12
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:54,791
[TENGAN] I see. And have you
watched the video yourself?

13
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,291
No, sir.

14
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:01,916
[TENGAN]
Very well.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,500
Excellent work.
I'll handle it from here.

16
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:08,416
One other thing, sir. This one.

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,708
It's the video that forced all
of the Reserve Students to, uh,

18
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,750
commit mass suicide.

19
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:44,125
[phone ringing]

20
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,791
[MITARAI]
It's Tengan.

21
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,000
[ASAHINA]
But I thought he was dead.

22
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,750
A video file?

23
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,208
[TENGAN]
Hello, Mitarai.

24
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,041
Apologies, but if
you're watching this,

25
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:07,333
it must already be past the
point of no return for me.

26
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,916
I don't expect a young man
like you to understand,

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,208
but there it is.

28
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,541
My time's run out.

29
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,416
Old geezers put
more stock in youth

30
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,416
than I'm sure most
people realize.

31
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,125
Hope means entrusting the future

32
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,041
to those who remain
after we're gone.

33
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,500
To that end,

34
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,083
Hope's Peak High School was
the sum of my life's work.

35
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,750
The students were my children,

36
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,541
the comfort of my
twilight years.

37
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,125
Watching them grow into
positions of leadership,

38
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,333
seeing the brightest among
them take the reins

39
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,958
of the Foundation
with confidence...

40
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,291
...what an
unparalleled privilege.

41
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:42,750
If, however, humanity's vanguard
were to lose its way,

42
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,041
submit to the worst
in themselves,

43
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,333
turn on and massacre
one another,

44
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,541
the pain would be more

45
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,416
than what's left of
the world could bear.

46
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,625
Part of me dies at
the very thought.

47
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:57,625
To imagine the blood spilt,
your faces twisted in agony.

48
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,000
Dear God, can't you picture it?

49
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:03,250
Can't you feel the
abject Despair?

50
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:07,250
Better yet, isn't it wonderful
to see it all come true?

51
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,166
[MITARAI]
I don't believe it.

52
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,583
Tengan really was with
the Remnants of Despair.

53
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,375
[MITARAI yells]

54
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,708
[ASAHINA]
Uh, who cares?

55
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,125
Focus on the important stuff.

56
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,041
Our bangles are
finally shut off.

57
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,250
We're free! We don't have
to kill each other anymore!

58
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,583
Come on, let's
get outta here.

59
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:42,458
[MITARAI] I'm a coward.
I let Despair win.

60
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:46,916
I ran. I should've
stood my ground.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,208
I should've fought.

62
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,500
Mitarai, you--

63
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:57,166
[MITARAI]
No more. I've had enough.

64
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,208
I'm through running.
This time, I do what's right.

65
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,041
You need to know the truth.

66
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,166
I've loved anime as
long as I can remember.

67
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,583
All I ever wanted
was to make one...

68
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:20,333
...one that would fill
people's hearts with Hope.

69
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:26,208
Instead, I had the misfortune
of meeting Junko Enoshima.

70
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:29,083
She used my talents for evil.

71
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:33,625
To control people, drive them
to slaughter each other.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,083
A video of Despair?

73
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:43,000
If I showed it to you, your mind
would warp exactly like hers.

74
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,041
You'd crave Despair like a drug.

75
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:52,041
My friends, who Naegi tried
to save, it happened to them.

76
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,541
This was my fault from
beginning to end.

77
00:04:56,625 --> 00:05:00,333
I was just... too scared
to say anything!

78
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,125
The monitors have been
showing something similar.

79
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,500
I'm positive my tech
was behind it.

80
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,833
Junko just added a new twist.

81
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,083
[MITARAI]
For whatever reason,

82
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:17,250
Tengan acquired the video
and decided to use it.

83
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,666
All he had to do was program
it into the monitors

84
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,208
and watch the Foundation topple.

85
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:26,583
Okay, but what would possess him
to do that in the first place?

86
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:30,000
At some point he must've
seen the original video.

87
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:33,750
There's no point blaming him.
He's a casualty too.

88
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,333
Just another of Junko's victims.

89
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,458
Huh?

90
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,833
I'm putting a stop to this.

91
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,583
Once and for all.

92
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,541
Time I did the right thing.

93
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,750
I have a new video.

94
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,208
This one spreads
Hope like a virus.

95
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,750
I'm not so sure about that.

96
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,125
Don't you get it, Naegi?

97
00:05:56,208 --> 00:06:00,000
I mean, my anime is
what caused all this.

98
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,708
[MITARAI]
It was terrified, paralyzed.

99
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:09,583
But I-- I still couldn't
deny my passion.

100
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,166
I have to bring Hope back.

101
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,916
This video needs to
be seen by everyone.

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,458
All the damage she made my
former classmates cause,

103
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,375
I can reverse!

104
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,458
But can you really
call that Hope?

105
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,000
I get what you're saying,

106
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,833
but at the end of the day,
it's still just brainwashing.

107
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,375
[MITARAI]
I know.

108
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:33,333
I've weighed the pros
and cons. Trust me.

109
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,708
Human beings are weak.

110
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,791
We're infinitely
susceptible to Despair.

111
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:43,375
Little by little,
it starts to define us.

112
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,291
Eventually, it's all we know.

113
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,125
We can't get on top of it.

114
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,541
Yes we can!

115
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,041
If we'd all just work together,

116
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,791
Despair wouldn't have
the final say anymore!

117
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,250
Don't be so stupid!

118
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,833
What?

119
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,500
Why the hell else do you think
the world's like this, Naegi?

120
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,500
Look, not all of us are as
strong as you, okay?!

What're you talking about?

You're the exception to the rule
and you damn well know it.

Hold up a sec!

Let's just slow down and
talk about this, 'kay?

you do to her? Uh?

[MITARAI] I'm sorry.
This'll all be for the best.

Wait, Mitarai!

You don't know
what you're doing!

I am! Thank you!

Can you tell me what
the hell's going on?

Do you know the location
of the other directors?

145
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,375
I need you to look
at something.

146
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,583
Transmit this to all personnel.

147

Listen to me.

148
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:11,041
If anyone doesn't cooperate,
or attempts to intervene...

149
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,166
...eliminate them.

150
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,583
The Hope of the world
depends on it.

151
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,125
[MITARAI] Despair breeds
within the human heart.

152
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,541
It's part of who we are.

153
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:29,416
Therefore, the heart
itself must be altered.

154
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,458
Envy, jealousy, hatred,
sadness, rage.

155
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:38,958
Every negative emotion we're
capable of must be overwritten.

156
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,041
As long as there's
a willing host,

157
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,208
Despair will be the
engine of history.

158
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,583
It's up to me. This ends now.

Asahina, please let go of me!
He's getting away!

00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,666
Hey look! We're saved!

162
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,875

[BOTH yelp]

164
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,875
What on earth is going on?

165
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,125
[MUNAKATA] A video able to
subliminally recondition

166
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,000
the whole human race?

167
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,291
Munakata. Help us, please.

168
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,041
We have to stop him
before this goes too far.

169
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,416
[MUNAKATA]
How ironic.

170
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,208
[NAEGI]
Uh?

171
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:37,083
Tengan aligned himself to
the Remnants of Despair.

172
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,625
Yet ultimately he's the reason

173
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,208
Despair will be
vanquished for good.

174
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,041
Wait a second. This cant' be.

175
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,250
Maybe he wasn't with
the enemy after all.

176
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,416
[ASAHINA]
Huh?

177
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,708
Maybe that's what
Tengan had planned.

178
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,250
Don't you see?

179
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,708
He knew this was the only way
Mitarai would use his video!

180
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,541
[MUNAKATA]
If that is indeed the case,

181
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,041
why would he broadcast
this Killing Game?

182
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,875
It would seem his goal
was spreading Despair

183
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,333
across the world.

184
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,958
Yeah, but that's just
what I'm getting at.

185
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,291
The killings weren't broadcast.

186
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,333
[gasps]

187
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,000
He knew what he was doing.

'Course he did.

189
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,041
Tengan set this whole thing up

190
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,666
just to push Mitarai
over the edge.

191
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,875
That's what threw him off.
It all makes perfect sense.

192
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,541
[MITARAI]
Um, Chairman, sir?

193
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,375
[TENGAN]
Hm?

194
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,916
Sorry. I'm rather late.

195
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,875
[TENGAN]
Wait, Mitarai? You're here?

196
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:41,500
He wasn't invited.
He just showed up.

197
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,250
Mitarai didn't need to be here.

198
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,541
That's the point.

199
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,083
He only needed to know
about the Killing Game.

200
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,541
Tengan never intended for him

201
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,125
to be smack dab in
the middle of it!

202
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,250
Hold on.

203
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,541
Wouldn't the path
of least resistance

204
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,541
have been to steal the video?

[NAEGI]
Not necessarily.

206
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,500
It's not about that.

207
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:04,500
It's about Hope,
about Mitarai's potential.

208
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:08,041
That's it! That's who
the message was for!

209
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,083
Right or wrong,
Tengan was trying to ensure

210
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,958
that Hope would prevail.

211
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,333
By altering what it
means to be human.

212

Reducing us to mindless sheep.

213
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:30,000
Is there no other way to remove
Despair from the equation?

214
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:34,916
Must we be robbed of our
capacity for sadness and pain?

Where would he have access to a
large-scale broadcasting device?

In the annex.

My talents may
seem questionable,

266
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,458
but they've led me to witness

a lot of important
moments firsthand.

Okay, boys n' girls.

Future Foundation Chairman,
Kazuo Tengan!

272
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:28,208
Pretty sneaky, right? Bet ya
didn't see that one comin'!

273
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,500
So Tengan and Munakata
used to be buds,

274
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:35,083
but then Munakata was all,
"I shall eradicate Despair."

275
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,208
And Tengan, 'cause he's
old n' crusty, was like,

276
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,958
"Eradicating Despair
will not create Hope."

277
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,208
Or whatever.
They had a falling out.

278
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,208
Well, that's the
official line anyway.

279
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,208
The real reason was 'cause
Yukizome asked him to

280
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,291
"create a world
without Despair,"

281

or some super cheesy
BS to that effect.

282
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,083
Not really your fault.

Heh. You've been on
Despair's side for a while.

Nice job keeping it on the DL.

285
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,958
Meh. I'm good with blaming
this all on Tengan.

286
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,333
Loopy ol' codger wanted Mitarai

287
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,291
to broadcast the
video of Hope so bad,

288
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,458
he was willing to do
just about anything.

289
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,291
Well, not anything.

290
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,583
He couldn't let go of the whole

291
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,208
"let the boy decide
for himself" gambit.

292
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,958
But seriously,
considering everything

293
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,458
he put Mitarai through,

what else was the poor
kid gonna choose?

Gimme a break! These idiots
never learn, do they?

Crap! Running outta
airtime. Fast-forward!

Hold up. How's that not just
another form of brainwashing?

Excellent question.

304

In any event, he was busted

305
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,875
before ascertaining whether
his version of it worked,

306
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,041
and then brought before
the Future Foundation.

307
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,375
All part of Chairman
Tengan's master plan.

taken it into account,

but whichever way this
goes, they're screwed.

a homicidal whack job.

to a literal pile of rubble,

317
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,166
and for your finale,
tripped the light fantastic

318
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,875
right in front of yo' man
just to make extra sure!

319
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:26,666
Ha! Dirty girl! Go you!

320
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,583
[YUKIZOME] Hope never
really stood a chance.

321
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:34,583
Despair won the war before
the first battle even began.

322
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,958
Faith was shattered.
Love was betrayed.

323
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:41,583
Darkness fell. Light faded.

324
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,375
And now, the future
is yesterday's dream

325
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,166
come home to die.

326
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,041
Aww! The story's already over?

327
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,041
[YUKIZOME]
No.

328
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,125
[ENOSHIMA]
Hm?

329
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,833
Bizarre as it sounds, our Hope
is just getting warmed up.

330
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,833
Lame.

331
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,625
Huh. As if I even care.

332
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,833
Get over yourself,
slut. We're dead!

333
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:48,291
[HAGAKURE] What're you doing?
Leave Naegster alone!

334
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:50,833
Hagakure?

335
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:52,166
[HAGAKURE]
Huh?

336
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,541
Whoa, whoa! Hey, wait!
Don't shoot! We surrender!

337
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:01,791
[TOGAMI] I believe an
explanation is in order.

338
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,500
Beg your pardon.

339
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:10,333
At whom are you pointing
those firearms?

340
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,375
[NAEGI]
Togami?!

341
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:24,375
How disappointing.

342
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:27,833
For someone so famously
lucky, you look like hell.

343
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:36,333
