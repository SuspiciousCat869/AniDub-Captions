[MUNAKATA]
Makoto Naegi.

2
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,291
[MUNAKATA] What lines are
you willing to cross

3
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:20,375
to stand on the side of Hope?

4
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:23,625
How badly do want to
see Despair vanquished?

5
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:28,791
Show us. Do the honorable
thing and commit suicide.

6
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,083
[MONOKUMA]
Rule Number One:

7
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:26,083
The all-important time limit.

8
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,541
When the clock runs out on
those nifty li'l arm bangles,

9
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,958
boys and girls, each
of you will be injected

10
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:34,791
with a powerful dose
of Good Night Irene.

11
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,875
Rule Number Two: The Attacker.

12
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,125
While everyone else
is catchin' dem z's,

13
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:43,708
he or she will be wide-awake
and ready to stir things up.

14
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,166
Once on the prowl,
the Attacker will be given

15
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,708
an interval good for
killing exactly one person.

16
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,708
Yep. 'Case you haven't figured
it out yet, there's a traitor.

17
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:55,541
And if you want the Future
Foundation to have a future,

18
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,000
you're gonna have ta do
somethin' about it!

19
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,375
Heck, why not gang up on
someone you don't like

20
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,208
and pray they're the Attacker?

21
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,875
If nap time comes and goes

22
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,583
and by some miracle
no one's been killed,

23
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,833
you win the game!

24
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,875
Rule Number Three:
Forbidden Actions.

25
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,666
Take another look
at those bangles.

26
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,916
Trust me on this,
you'll be glad ya did.

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,083
Note that each of you
has a specific thing

28
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,083
you're not allowed
to do at any time.

29
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,291
Performing said thing

30
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,125
will trigger a lethal
injection of poison

31
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,875
faster than you can
say "I can't even."

32
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:29,583
For example, let's pretend
I'm forbidden to laugh.

33
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:30,916

[MONOKUMA]
Aye-chi-wawa!

36
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,000
[MONOKUMA] So we all
clear on the rules? Good.

37
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:44,625
Oh, and uh, don't get cute
and try to rip the bangles off.

38
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,916
That's another surefire way
of gettin' yourself poisoned.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,375
Have fun!

40
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,541
Mind those Forbidden Actions
and suss out the Attacker

41
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,000
before you all die one by one!

42
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,791
Wh-What is he
even talking about?

43
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,125
[MONOKUMA]
Silly me.

44
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,166
Something else I
forgot to mention.

45
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,375
The festivities are being
recorded for broadcast

46
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,833
to an adoring public
the world over.

47
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,708
That's right. You meat-bags
are a hot-ticket item.

48
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,458
Oh. Beg your pardon,
did I say meat-bags?

49
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:20,208
I meant survivors. Brilliant
and talented survivors.

50
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,708
So it's exactly like last time.

51
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,750

[USAMI] I demand to know who's
pulling your strings, puppet!

54
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,416
Who the heck is that?

You don't know?

56

She's one of the top developers
for the New World program.

57
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,875
[ASAHINA] Wait. You mean
that's Miss Gekkogahara?

58
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,708
The girl so painfully shy
she only ever talks to people

59
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,875
through her avatar?

60
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,291
Uh, ma'am? I really wouldn't...

61
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,083
[USAMI] I will not sit back and
allow the Future Foundation

62
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,708
to be hacked by
the likes of you!

63
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,958
[MONOKUMA]
Hm? Somebody talkin'?

64
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,625
Don't believe I've
had the pleasure.

65

Oh, honey. We gotta do
somethin' about that getup.

66
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,583
Ta-dah!

67

[USAMI]
What's going on?

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,666
My protocols are
being overridden!

69
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,041
How is this possible?

70

[MONOKUMA]
Can it, cutie pie!

71

Stop whining and
do as big brother says!

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,708
[USAMI] Are you trying to
suggest we're related?

'S like a banquet

Mark my words.

is a fine mess we're in.

Stop. Maybe later.

Hey, look. This is
Monokuma's MO.

93
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,458
He wants to tear us apart.

94
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,333
We have to work together.

95
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,166
I couldn't agree more.

96
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,083
[MUNAKATA] The Future
Foundation will persevere.

97
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:23,041
We will face the enemy as one.

98

Undivided.

Ugh. Out of everyone here,
why did she have to die?

102

completely useless!

I might be able to
get us back online,

105

but it's gonna take a while!

Wow. You'd think we'd
have a better firewall here.

we are more than prepared

Just as I thought.

There's no escaping.

[JUZO]
That settles it.

120
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,833
We have to find out who the
Attacker is and kill them.

Yeah, I don't think so.

Yes, well, apart from Naegi.

129
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,583
The idea of confining
any of us to this room

00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:47,708
[KIRIGIRI]
It was this.

159
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,916
[KIRIGIRI] "Witnessing
violence by participants."

160
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,500
[GOZU]
Juzo, what have you done?

161
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,208
Oh, I get it.

162
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,333
That's gonna be how
they pick us off.

163
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,375
[USAMI]
E-Everyone, keep your heads!

164
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,041
We have the means to prevent
this from happening again.

165
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,625
First, we need to
consult the bangles

166
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,000
and confirm our specific
Forbidden Actions!

167
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,208
If you think I'll share my
Achilles Heel with you people,

168
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,291
you're sorely mistaken!

169
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,541
Some of us clearly
can't be trusted!

170
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,583
Fair point.

171
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,125
That of course,
and for all we know,

172
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,333
revealing our Forbidden
Action may just be

173
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,958
someone's Forbidden Action.

174
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,416
[GOZU]
Yes. But even so--

175
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:33,541
[MUNAKATA] We need to decide
on a course of action.

176
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,583
Evidently there's no
means of putting a stop

177
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,250
to the game itself.

178
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,541
So we'll find the attacker.

179
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,583
No doubt each of us has
already picked out a favorite.

180
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:46,583
And since time is short,
I say we put it to a vote.

181
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:50,416
Everyone, point to the person
you believe to be responsible.

182
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,875
[USAMI] What? W-W-Why
would you suspect me?!

183
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,750
Meh. Call it a hunch.

184
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:03,666
[ASAHINA gasps]

185
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,750
Whoa! Now hold on a second!

186
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:12,791
It's decided. Makoto Naegi.

187
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,500
What lines are you
willing to cross

188
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,916
to stand on the side of Hope?

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,666
How badly do want to
see Despair vanquished?

190
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,541
Show us.

191
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,625
Do the honorable thing
and commit suicide.

192
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,500
[ASAHINA] You expect Naegi to
kill himself? Just like that?

193
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,041
This is insane!

194
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,083
There's not enough evidence
to point the finger at anyone!

195
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,000
I assume you have
an alternative.

196
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,375
Or should we be content to wait
for the Attacker's next move?

197
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,041
[ASAHINA]
Well, no, but--

198
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:50,791
Be fair! What if he's
not the one responsible?

199
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:54,416
Then we keep voting. Sooner
or later we'll get it right.

200
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,541
A desperate measure, perhaps,
but effective nonetheless.

201
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,875
Good for weeding out traitors.

202
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,416
[TENGAN]
Munakata, you can't be serious!

203
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,333
Oh, I'm quite serious, sir.

204
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:08,000
The Remnants of Despair must
be eliminated at any cost.

205
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,625
Naegi understands that.
Better than most, I'd wager.

206
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:16,125
When our backs are against the
wall, cooperation is essential.

207
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,875
You agree, don't you?

208
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,541
Or maybe you're torn.

209
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,250
[NAEGI]
You're asking me to--

210
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,416
[JUZO]
If you won't, then I will!

211
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,708
[GOZU]
That's enough!

212
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:40,375
[GOZU] Hope won't come in
the form of a comrade's death!

213
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,500
[MUNAKATA]
A noble sentiment.

214
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,500
But you seem to have
conveniently forgotten

215
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,416
countless comrades
have already fallen

216
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,333
at the hands of the enemy.

217
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,833
Unless we want their sacrifice
to be meaningless,

218
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,166
we have to fight fire with fire.

219
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,208
Let's go.

00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,083

C'mon! We gotta
get out of here!

224

Wait. They'll rip
each other apart.

225

[ASAHINA] If that's what they
wanna do, more power to 'em!

226

They're not gonna
listen to reason!

227

Right now, we run!

228
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,333
Uh, it's not that simple.

229
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,833
Believe me, I would if I could.

230
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,416
But under the circumstances.

231
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,625
What?

232
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,666
Normally this would be the
other way around, but whatever!

The only thing it

Uh, excuse me, Chairman,
what are you doing?

Isn't this harassment?

00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,958
Not remotely.

block off the entrances.

[GOZU] That does it!
You've gone too far, asshole!

I'd sooner lay down my life.

The Great Gozu knows
the cost of doing right,

252

and he's willing to pay it!

combat Despair? Pathetic.

Why can't you understand?

If just one of their
number is left alive,

back like roaches!

you never gave in to Despair.

Countless lives were
changed because of that.

engine that drives our future.

314
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:15,708
Uh, that's kind of you to
say, but a little overdone.

315
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,333
[GOZU] The Chairman was
thrilled to have you.

316
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:21,791
Said with you on board,
a new era was dawning.

317
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,208
The Future Foundation
would be revolutionized!

318
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,833
So spare me your
slump-shouldered modesty.

319
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,333
People are rooting
for you, jackass!

320
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,208
[NAEGI]
Yes, sir.

321
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,166
[MUNAKATA] I take it you
didn't find the others?

322
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,083
What can I say? They
split up and ran. Cowards.

323
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,916
Here we are at the
threshold of Hell

324
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,333
and all anyone gives a damn
about is saving themselves.

325
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,291
So I assume you gotta plan?

326
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:57,250
The same one as always.
We annihilate the Despairs.

327
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,166
[JUZO]
Then I s'pose I'll protect you.

328
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,875
Nothin' new 'bout that.

329
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,791
[JUZO]
I know what Hope looks like.

330
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,875
As long as you
make it outta this,

331
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,541
the Future Foundation
can rebuild.

332
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,250
Them's the breaks.

333
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,250
Anyone I don't trust
is gonna wind up dead.

334
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:19,791
And I'll be damned if Yukizome's
murder goes un-avenged.

335
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,500
[USAMI] Get ready.
Time is almost up.

336
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:31,208
[GOZU] Good luck, comrades.
Nothing left but to pray.

337
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,791
Naegi, what do we do?
I'm scared.

338
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,833
Something tells me this
will only get worse.

339
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,541
We're gonna be okay.

340
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,458
Super High
School-Level Luck here!

341
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,458
Nothin' to worry about!

342
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,291
'S long as we stick close,
it'll rub off on ya!

343
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,791
It isn't fair.

344
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,916
Look at you. I mean, how do
you always stay so positive?

345
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,458
[music plays]

346
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,583
I appreciate it, Naegi.

347
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,916
Like I even did anything.

348
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,416
Give yourself some credit. Asa--

349
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,833
[MONOKUMA]
Wakey-wakey, Attacker.

350
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:30,791
The killin' clock is tickin'!

351
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:31,958
Time for the hunt!

352
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,583
Get out there and
make some magic!

353
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:38,250
That's it. Low-hangin'
fruit for the pickin'!

354
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,791
Who's the lucky target today?

355
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,250
