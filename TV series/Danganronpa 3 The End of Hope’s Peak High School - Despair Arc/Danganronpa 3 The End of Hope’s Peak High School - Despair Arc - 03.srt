1
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,416
[NAEGI]
Oh, God! Asahina!

2
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,958
[USAMI]
No, no, no!

3
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:24,500
Tell me I'm still asleep
and this is just a nightmare!

4
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,708
[ASAHINA groans]

5
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,083
Ah! What's going on? Blood?

6
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,333
[USAMI] Oh, thank goodness!
You're not dead!

7
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:48,041
But you must be hurt! Do you
feel faint or light-headed?

8
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,291
Is there discomfort?

9
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,916
Quick, find something
to stop the bleeding!

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,458
What the--? Tomato sauce?

11
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,250
[NAEGI]
And a toy knife?

12
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,375
[dripping]

13
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:02,375
[USAMI]
Huh?

14
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,875
[USAMI screams]

15
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,416
[USAMI]
That's not tomato sauce, is it?

16
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,208
The Attacker was
able to get in here?

17
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:16,166
So that could've been any of us.

18
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,541
[NAEGI]
It's happening...

19
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:19,750
Again...

20
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:23,000
How many times do we
have to go through this?

21
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,291
[GOZU]
Incredible.

22
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,750
During School Life
of Mutual Killing,

23
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,041
you never gave in to Despair.

24
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,666
Countless lives were
changed because of that.

25
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,291
So spare me your slump
shouldered modesty.

26
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,666
People are rooting
for you, jackass!

27
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,791
I'm sorry.

28
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,958
Rise and shine, Yoi Yoi.

29
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,250
Here. Say "Ahh."

30
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,916
No. Knock it off.

31
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:21,125
Seems we made it through
the second time limit.

32
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,500
Well, well. I guess
we managed to survive.

33
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,166
Quite a relief, eh?

34
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:35,958
[KIRIGIRI]
Why do I get the feeling

35
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,166
he wasn't too worried about it?

36
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,750
[MUNAKATA]
We're still alive and kicking.

37
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,916
Huh. I had put
the odds at 50-50.

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,541
Hell of a thing to be
cocky about, pal.

39
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,166
Merely being logical.

40
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,708
If I were the Attacker,
I'd kill from the top down.

41
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,166
[JUZO]
Hm.

42
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,500
Makes sense if the goal's
to pick all of us off.

43
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,500
Then again, who knows?

44
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,916
[MUNAKATA] That would be
the best case scenario.

45
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,458
Whatever they're playing at,

46
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:08,208
we can be certain fates far
worse than death are on offer.

47
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,083
[ASAHINA
'Kay.

48
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,791
There we go.

49
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,958
[ASAHINA]
All right, people.

50
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,500
The name of the game is "Survive
and Find the Attacker."

51
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,083
Sure, yeah.

52
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,083
So, Naegi, you holdin' up okay?

53
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,541
Uh. You bet!

54
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,583
The main thing; we have to
prevent any more deaths.

55
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,625
[USAMI] And we do that by
exposing the one responsible!

56
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,375
I'm sure Naegi has a plan.

57
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:43,916
Uhh... Well, uh, we should
start by talking to everybody.

58
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,208
Question is, how?

59
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,291
[USAMI]
Oo! Oo! I know!

60
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,000
We'll hack into the
intercom system

61
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,208
so the whole building
can hear you!

62
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:51,958
[ASAHINA]
Huh?

63
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,833
[NAEGI]
We can do that?

64
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,125
[USAMI] You bet your
sweet tuchus we can!

65
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,791
Monokuma deleted a ton
of data off the server,

66
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,708
but I've been able to
restore bits and pieces.

67
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,000
[ASAHINA]
Let's see.

68
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,500
Huh. Right, okay.

69
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,791
So remind me what kind of
building this is again?

70
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:07,958
[USAMI]
No problem.

71
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,375
It was intended to
function more or less

72
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,458
as an overseas branch
of Hope's Peak,

73
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,791
at least in the beginning.

74
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,208
However after the Biggest,
Most Atrocious,

75
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,083
Despair-Inducing Incident
in Human History,

76
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,583
construction was interrupted,
and for obvious reasons,

77
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,625
the original plan
had to be scrapped.

78
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:26,500
[NAEGI] Exactly. Munakata
repurposed it as a base.

79
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:30,958
And unless I'm wrong: Jackpot.
There's the intercom.

80
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,416
[USAMI]
The monitoring room. Naturally.

81
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:38,291
Let's do it. I can talk
to everyone from there.

82
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,916
No one else dies on my watch.

83
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:56,541
Uh. Mind if I ask you something?

84
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,625
Are you not able to make
a right turn, or--?

85
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,000
[USAMI]
Oh no!

86
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,291
You've discovered my Forbidden
Action! I'm doomed!

87
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,166
Um. Whoa! It's okay.

88
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,916
I was wondering why you did
that whenever we went right.

89
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,625
[USAMI]
Oh! This is awful!

90
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,250
My secrets out in the open!
I-I'm done for!

91
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,250
Finished! Exterminated!
Tripping...

92
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,916
I'd never do that.

93
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,833
There's nothing to
worry about, honest!

94
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,958
[USAMI] R-R-Really? You're not
just saying that to trick me?

95
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,250
You could be saying
that to trick me!

96
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,875
Take a look.

97
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,875
[USAMI] "Forbidden Action:
Running in the hallway."

98
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:32,958
[NAEGI chuckles]

99
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,250
Now we know each
other's big weakness.

100
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,750
That puts us in the same boat.

101
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,666
[USAMI]
Y-Yes, it does! Thank you!

102
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,625
[ASAHINA]
I'll show you mine too!

103
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,500
[NAEGI]
"Be hit with a punch or a kick."

104
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:50,666
[USAMI]
Oh, wow! You've come so close!

105
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,625
Naegi, I'm sorry about earlier.

106
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,625
When we were voting,
I was so scared.

107
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,166
I couldn't even move.

108
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,583
I should've
protected you, but...

109
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:05,125
[NAEGI] No, listen, I get it.
We've seen what can happen.

110
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,666
You gotta be careful.
Don't blame yourself.

111
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,958
I'm fine now!
I'm totally ready for it!

112
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,541
Well now, let's not
do anything crazy.

113
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,500
[USAMI] Hooray! We all know
each other's Forbidden Action!

114
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,125
I feel so much better!

115
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,750
In a way, it's kinda like
we're soul mates now!

116
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,583
[ASAHINA]
Mh-hm!

117
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,166
I don't see why not.

118
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,916
It's kind of a relief having
our secrets out in the open.

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,250
Now we know how to
watch each other's--

120
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,375
[ASAHINA]
Shh!

121
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,208
[ASAHINA]
Get to the monitoring room.

122
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,083
I'll draw them away.
Go while there's still time.

123
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,708
That's too dangerous.
No, I'll lead them off.

124
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,250
Doing what? Power
walking? Come on!

125
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,791
Uhh... But I...

126
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:47,916
Go!

127
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,208
Asahina, wait!

128
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,500
[USAMI]
I'll be her backup!

129
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,875
Don't worry. We've got this!
Soul mates forever!

130
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,541
[SEIKO] Where do you
think you're going?

131
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,375
Good luck, you two. Be safe.

132
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,875
[HAGAKURE]
Hello?!

133
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:29,250
Hey, Naegi! Are you okay?!
Asahina?! Kirigiri?!

134
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,541
[helicopter whirring]

135
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,958
Keep it down! Jeez!

136
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,833
[HAGAKURE] Yeah.
They know what they're doin'.

137
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,375
I shouldn't worry.

138
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,666
[KIRIGIRI] The fewer of us left,
the easier to find the killer.

139
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,333
The rules put them
at a disadvantage.

140
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,791
It's like they have
no intention of winning.

141
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,833
[MITARAI]
Where are you going?

142
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,000
Where I can properly do my job.

143
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,583
I'm a detective, and you can bet
while we were unconscious

144
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,125
someone was being killed.

145
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,625
Yes. But it's not
advisable to go alone.

146
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,416
We should accompany you.

147
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,583
One killer's bad enough.

148
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:17,458
Now Munakata's out for blood.
Why does he want Naegi dead?

149
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,250
Munakata's a man of
singularly strong will,

150
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,250
which breeds Hope.

151
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,208
That said, what he
fails to realize

152
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,583
is strength can just as
easily breed Despair.

153
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,500
[MITARAI grunts]

154
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,083
What's the matter?

155
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,708
The things we do here,

156
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,750
they're being broadcast for
the entire world to see?

157
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,291
Yes.

158
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,250
[MITARAI]
Then, we...

159
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,916
We shouldn't be putting
each other through this!

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,666
I need-- I mean,
we need to pull together!

161
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,541
Okay. Then do me a favor.

162
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,458
Please, if you don't mind,
show me your Forbidden Action.

163
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,666
[gasps]

164
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,166
I can't.

165
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,416
Then I'm in the same
position as you.

166
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,333
So there it is.
That's our reality.

167
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,916
It's hard for people
to pull together

168
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,416
without the luxury of trust.

169
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,000
That's probably what
the Forbidden Actions

170
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,958
are all about in
the first place.

171
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,250
They're a built in method for
turning us against the group.

172
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,291
The objective's to
make us feel isolated.

173
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,708
[microphone hums]

174
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:20,625
[NAEGI] Uh. Um, can you hear me?
This is Makoto Naegi.

175
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,875
Bad news.
The Great Gozu is dead.

176
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:28,708
The Attacker got to him
while we were asleep.

177
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,958
Clearly, whoever it is
has to be stopped.

178
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:36,750
Thing is, while trying to unmask
them, we can't doubt each other.

179
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,208
That's what Monokuma wants.

180
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,291
So let's talk about this.

181
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,208
I know some of you
are utterly convinced

182
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,500
I'm on the side of the Remnants,
and I don't blame you.

183
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,708
Not at all.

184
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,041
My actions have led you
to that conclusion.

185
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:54,375
A while back, as part of
Branch Office Fourteen,

186
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,416
I ran rescue missions.

187
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,958
During this period,

188
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:02,375
I stumbled across fellow alumni,
ex-students of Hope's Peak.

189
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,500
[NAEGI] Instantly I could
tell that they belonged

190
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,083
to the Remnants of Despair.

191
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,166
That they'd killed people.

192
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,375
Driven the world into
darkness and chaos.

193
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,583
But also that they were human.

194
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:27,291
Maybe even, deep down,
as normal as you and me.

195
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,083
They'd fought and laughed
and horsed around.

196
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,833
They had a chance.

197
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:38,625
If they hadn't met Enoshima...
they'd have had a chance.

198
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,583
[NAEGI] There was a way
to save them though.

199
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,125
The New World Program.

200
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,250
[NAEGI]
Virtual rehabilitation.

201
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,750
A cutting edge treatment
for lost souls.

202
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,125
Using it, I could
restore their memories

203
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,166
to a time before Despair.

204
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,708
A time before Junko.

205
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,541
There were complications.

206
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:05,125
Needless to say, things didn't
go as smoothly as I'd hoped.

207
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,958
But despite everything
that happened,

208
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,916
I believed it worked.

209
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:15,500
So there. That's it.
That's my story.

210
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,250
We all have our point of view.

211
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,750
We're all in our
own circumstances.

212
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,583
Even so, if we can
just talk it out,

213
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,125
I'm convinced we can
set aside our fear.

214
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,250
If we expect to get
through this in one piece,

215
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,416
our best hope is each other!

216
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,250
To prove my point.

217
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:38,500
I'm done. I'm turning
my back on the game.

218
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,791
And just so you know,

219
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,583
my Forbidden Action is
running in the hallway.

220
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,958
[NAEGI]
You wanna kill me? That's how.

221
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,500
Think about it.

222
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,500
If I were the Attacker, would
I give you this information?

223
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:59,250
Call it collateral.
Please, just trust me.

224
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,958
Lamest speech I ever
heard in my life.

225
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,875
Really? For my money
I'd call it quite elegant.

226
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,750
Though rather noticeably empty.

227
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,625
His philosophy is superficial.

228
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,916
He speaks of Hope without
having seen true Despair.

229
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,833
To fight darkness, a warrior
must first know it intimately.

230
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,375
He's in the monitoring room.

231
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,708
Stay here. I prefer
to do this alone.

232
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,208
Go for it, big guy.

233
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:32,041
But ya gotta at least let me
take care of his friends.

234

[RURUKA]
Stupid Naegi.

235
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,583
He just doesn't understand
how it's done.

236
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,916
Stand out like a sore thumb,
and you get targeted first.

237
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,166
That's Killing 101.

238
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,291
So should we--?

As if we have the time!

240
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,583
Forget about it.
What else can we do?

241
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,333
We're not in this to
teach anyone a lesson.

242

Our priority is staying alive.

Lucky me. There's someone
by my side I can trust.

There certainly is.

just not me, okay?

So, um, why'd he tell us
his Forbidden Action?

283
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,875
As a testament to his
faith in us. Presumably.

284

All of us? Even Munakata,
who told Naegi to kill himself?

285
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,583
[TENGAN] Makoto's a dyed
in the wool optimist.

286
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,625
He knows who his
enemies are, of course,

287
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,750
but he believes in the power
of civilized discourse.

288
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,583
So he thinks they
can talk it out?

289
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,916
Oh, I'm certain it all sounds
just as insane to him,

290
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,791
and yet, sometimes believing
in your fellow man

291
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,500
calls for exactly that.

292
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,333
Optimism is nothing
if not a leap of faith.

293

[MITARAI] I guess.
Not sure I'll ever know.

Things don't have to be this
way, Munakata. Let's talk.

We're comrades.

There's no reason we shouldn't
be able to hear each other out.

That's what the
Future Foundation is!

We're all supposed to be
on the same side here!

You're impressive.

I saw you on the
broadcast, of course.

And I'll be the first to admit,

312
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,125
watching you hold your
own was inspirational.

313
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,208
Deeply. Yet for
all that heroism,

314
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:16,208
you only won because it
was no more than a game.

315
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,083
What are you saying?

316
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,375
Our lives were on
the line in there!

317
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,250
And the rules were clear.

318
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,916
Oh, I'll grant you the stakes
were definitely high.

319
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,625
But I defy anyone to argue
the guidelines for survival

320
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,083
were vague.

321
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:32,750
Out here, things
aren't so cut and dry.

322
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,750
In the real world,
there are no rules.

323
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:40,166
Platitudes and a positive
outlook aren't worth a damn.

324
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,041
[MUNAKATA]
You don't know true Despair.

325
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,125
You don't know the hell
we've put ourselves through

326
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,375
to keep people alive.

327
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:53,375
The real world is
very violent place.

328
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:59,250
Enough to crush a man's spirit.
Enough to drive him mad.

329
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,250
You and your friends
were hand-picked.

330
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:06,250
Kept alive. Memories wiped.
You had no clue.

331
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,833
So you can talk, sure.

332
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,458
But that is about the
only thing you can do.

333
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,750
That's not fair!
You talk about platitudes,

334
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:14,875
but so what?

335
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,125
Hope has gotta start
somewhere, right?

336
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,833
When the real world gets ugly,
you power through!

337
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,041
You believe and put it in words!

338
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:25,791
It's how Hope spreads!
How you give it to others!

339
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,625
You believe hollow
words are really enough

340
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,083
to make people act?

341
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,750
Absolutely I do!
And people will!

342
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,666
Words are hollow
sometimes, yeah,

343
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,916
but they can always
be filled in!

344
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:41,541
A rare gift indeed, and if
anyone's capable, it's you.

345
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,666
[MUNAKATA]
In fact, I'm sure of it.

346
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,708
Precisely the reason I
can't allow you to escape.

347
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,041
What're you doing?

348
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,333
I'm afraid you're
simply too dangerous.

349
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,875
Your "hollow words" might
spur people forward.

350
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,625
And Heaven only
knows to do what.

351
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,333
Hope! What else?

352
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:05,500
I don't think so.
You're too naïve.

353
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,666
But people might listen.
They'll take your side.

354
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,625
They'll believe the world
can actually be saved

355
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,125
without bloodshed.

356
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:15,125
But the world they're walking
into will be Hell itself.

357
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,083
You'll lead them to Despair!

358
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,000
Believe what you want.

359
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,541
For me, I believe what I say!

360
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,541
Truth can stay a man's hand.

361
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:27,083
Even now you make
me doubt my resolve.

362
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,208
But doubt alone won't stop me.

363
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,250
If there is any truth
in what you believe,

364
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,916
let words do the fighting.

365
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,541
Let's see your rhetoric
stop my blade.

366
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,625
I'm a different sort
of man than you.

367
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,125
I have faith in the
virtue of power.

368
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,791
Hope doesn't belong
to those willing to die.

369
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,208
It belongs to those
willing to kill!

370
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:51,541
And I will kill thousands if
it means I vanquish Despair.

371
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:55,083
That is the strength
of my conviction!

372
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,708
That is the future I envision.

373
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:03,208
Yes! A world without Despair
is a world worth fighting for!

374
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,500
Keep your platitudes.

375
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,250
I embrace the ugliness
of what must be done!

376
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,458
I am the true face of Hope!

377
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,958
[MUNAKATA]
How unfortunate.

378
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,666
Too bad this wasn't
a classroom trial.
