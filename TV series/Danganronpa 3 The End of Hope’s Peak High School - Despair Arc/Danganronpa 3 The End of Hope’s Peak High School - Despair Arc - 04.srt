1
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:14,666
[MONOKUMA] Hey-o, ladies and
germs! Time for a li'l recap!

2
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,291
Here's what's been going on
so far in <i>Danganronpa 3</i> .

3
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,750
Things kicked off with
Makoto Naegi being summoned

4
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,583
to a secret base
owned and operated

5
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,333
by the Future Foundation.

6
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,833
An imposing structure,
I'm sure you'll agree,

7
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:31,708
designed and built by Vice
Chairman Kyosuke Munakata.

8
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,666
Talk about a man obsessed!

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,000
He's absolutely bent on
annihilating despair!

10
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,000
Kind of a badass, really.

11
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:42,250
Anywho, Naegi was
dragged in by the ear.

12
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,125
Seems he had some
'splainin' to do

13
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,875
about allegedly
aiding and abetting

14
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,708
the Remnants of Despair.

15
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,250
Whoa! The Foundation
is under attack!

16
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,250
Uh-oh! Who could
do such a thing?

17
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:58,083
And ta-da! Another game
of Mutual Killing begins!

18
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,583
A murderer is on the loose!

19
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,416
Our contestants
must find the traitor

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,250
hiding among their ranks!

21
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,833
The rules are fairly
straightforward.

22
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,625
Get offed in your sleep:
Game over!

23
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:10,583
Perform the Forbidden Action
specified by your bangle:

24
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:13,083
Game over!

25
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,083
Suspicion is survival.

26
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,916
Don't like the cut of
someone's jib? Moider 'em!

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,875
If the Attacker doesn't strike
in the allotted time, you win!

28
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:25,041
Sadly, three people
are already dead.

29
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,958
Are the rest any closer
to exposing the Attacker?

30
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,291
Only 12 suspects remain.

31
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:33,750
Which of them do you think
has blood on their hands?

32
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,500
[MONOKUMA]
Anything can happen!

33
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:50,458
Who will make it
out of here alive?

34
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:54,958
More importantly, who's going
to be the next to die?

35
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,583
[laughing]

36
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,583
[JUZO]
Hm.

37
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:45,250
[TENGAN] Bit soon to rely on
violence, don't you think?

38
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:51,083
If Naegi's with the Remnants,
his pals must be too.

39
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:54,583
This isn't the sort of thing you
can pull off by your lonesome.

40
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,916
I suggest you step aside.

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,750
And I suggest you try
listening to reason.

42
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,625
Quit acting like your
damn title means a thing.

43
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,625
I take my orders from Munakata,

44
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:09,708
not some decrepit, washed up
old fart, "Mr. Chairman!"

45
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,541
What is he doing?

46
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,916
[MITARAI]
No! Stop it!

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,958
Move it!

48
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,166
[crack]

49
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,416
[KIRIGIRI groans]

50
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:49,041
[snarling]

51
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,041
Hooray! We got her!

52
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:02,791
Or not.

53
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,458
[RURUKA]
She isn't human!

54
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,416
[ASAHINA]
Oh God, what now?

55
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,708
[USAMI]
It-It sounded like an explosion!

56
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,166
We need to find
cover immediately!

57
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,666
Wow, that's some
serious traction.

58
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,166
I mean, uh, wait up!

59
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,791
Hey! Miss Gekkogahara!
Slow down!

60
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,083
What the hell?

61
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,041
[TENGAN]
Heh.

62
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,000
Excellent dodge.

63
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,833
[chuckles]

64
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:49,125
Not such a decrepit, washed-up
old fart after all, am I?

65
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,166
[gasps]

66
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,666
What's the hold up?

67
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,375
You're gonna punch
me, aren'tcha?

68
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,583
Oughtta be short work

69
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,750
for a former Super High
School-Level Boxer.

70
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,333
[chuckles]

71
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,625
[TENGAN groans]

72
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:35,541
[TENGAN]
Gracious. Young people today.

73
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,791
[MITARAI] So, uh, he won't
be able to follow us?

74
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,791
[KIRIGIRI]
Hopefully not.

75
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,833
[ASAHINA]
Kyoko!

76
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,000
[ASAHINA]
Thank goodness you're all right!

77
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:02,125
Thanks. Glad you're
still in one piece.

78
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,166
[ASAHINA]
Hold on, are you hurt?

79
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,166
Oh, it's nothing, really.

80
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,916
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

81
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,041
This... This happens every time.

82
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:19,291
Whenever I try to
help someone...

83
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,500
...I just cause them more pain.

84
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,208
I can't save anything.

85
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:29,458
Why is it so hard for
me to be like Naegi?

86
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,541
[KIRIGIRI]
Why bother to be like him?

87
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,291
I was under the impression
that you're you.

88
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,125
Come on. Hey!

89
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,458
You stepped up for me when push
came to shove, remember?

90
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,041
That pretty much saved my bacon!

91
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:45,625
I second that.
Violence is never the answer!

92
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,083
In a warzone,
it's anything goes!

93
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:55,666
That seems like a bit of
a stretch. Thank you, though.

94
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,625
It's true.

95
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:57,875
It's because you intervened

96
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,333
that we're even standing
here right now.

97
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,083
If you say so.

98
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,250
[microphone hums]

99
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,000
[MUNAKATA]
Attention, Foundation members.

100
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,916
Attention, Foundation members.

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,958
Is that?

102
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,250
That's Munakata.

103
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,666
[MUNAKATA] I have an
important announcement.

104
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,000
Makoto Naegi has been captured.

105
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,708
Is he for real?

106
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:28,250
[MUNAKATA] As I speak, I am
on the verge of executing him.

107
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,416
[USAMI]
What?!

108
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,291
No! This isn't happening!
What do we do?

109
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,125
It's a trap.

110
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,583
A trap?

111
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,083
It's obvious, really.

112
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,791
He's using Naegi to
draw us all in.

113
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,625
Yeah, I get that, but
what do we do about it?

114
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,000
He's going to execute Naegi!

115
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,333
I'll go and talk to him.

116
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,833
Look, if he hasn't killed
him yet, there's a reason.

117
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,791
We still have room to negotiate.

118
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,791
Perhaps I'll be able
to get through to him.

119
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,583
It's not your place.

120
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,750
If he's willing to negotiate,
let me do the talking.

121
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,416
[MUNAKATA]
Good you're awake.

122
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,625
What are you planning
on doing to me?

123
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,583
I plan to use you as bait.

124
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,208
Anyone willing to
attempt a rescue

125
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,500
is obviously not to be trusted.

126
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,666
But you... you don't have
to keep me alive for that.

127
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,541
Well, you're certainly
no less of a threat

128
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,291
for not being the Attacker.

129
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,875
I don't get it.

130
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,333
Think about the game's outcome.

131
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,541
Of all the ways this could end,

132
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,875
what's the most
terrifying possibility?

133
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,250
Everyone getting killed.

134
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,833
All of us being
slaughtered like cattle

135
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,625
till the Foundation is forfeit.

136
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,625
[MUNAKATA]
Wrong.

137
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,666
Indulge me.

138
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,250
Let's assume for the
sake of argument

139
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,458
the attacks stop with my death.

140
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,125
What might you deduce?

141
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,291
Well, I mean... that would
sorta point the finger at you

142
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,958
being the Attacker.

143
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,375
That would be the
sensible conclusion.

144
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:07,208
Then again, there's no way
to be absolutely certain.

145
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,083
[gasps] You've got a point!

146
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,333
There's no rule saying the
Attacker can't just stop

147
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,041
whenever they feel like it!

148
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,791
And if the Attacker sets up
a patsy to take the fall,

149
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,500
it would bring the
game to an end.

150
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:24,208
Ingratiating him or herself to
the surviving Foundation members

151
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,000
would then be child's play.

152
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,458
[NAEGI] The real Attacker
would be held up as a hero.

153
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,416
[MUNAKATA]
Yes.

154
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,750
Held up as a hero

155
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,291
and given control of
the Foundation itself.

156
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,875
If a beacon of Hope like you

157
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,958
happened to be among
the survivors,

158
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:43,458
the enemy's control
will be all but absolute.

159
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,375
People will rally around you.

160
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,375
The Remnants of
Despair know this.

161
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:51,750
They'll use you to
entrench themselves.

162
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,750
Despair will march
across the Earth,

163
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,250
all the while flying
the banner of Hope.

164
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,291
That would be the most
terrifying outcome.

165
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,291
I... I get it.

166
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:04,291
The Attacker would save me
because they need me alive.

167
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,416
I'm the cornerstone
of their whole plan.

168
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,958
So you do think logically.
Encouraging.

169
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,166
Indeed.

170
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,083
You and those who
might try to use you

171
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,833
must be killed to
thwart the enemy.

172
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,875
That can't be the only solution!

173
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:25,208
You'd just end up having
to kill everybody!

174
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:28,750
Do not underestimate
the Future Foundation.

175
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,916
This institution is ironclad.

176
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,708
All men die. But what I have
created here will endure.

177
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:40,166
You're insane.
The game's driven you mad!

178
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,750
[MUNAKATA] Tell me. Was Enoshima
defeated without sacrifice?

179
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,666
The hope you represent
spurs people to act.

180
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,291
And for that, here you are,

181
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,791
like a powder keg waiting
to be ignited by the enemy.

182
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,208
[TENGAN]
Let me do the talking.

183
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,666
It's for the best.

184
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,250
[KIRIGIRI]
Chairman.

185
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,166
Been meaning to have
a little chat with him

186
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,291
for some time now, honestly.

187
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,375
He and I go back aways.

188
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,583
[KIRIGIRI]
But, sir.

189
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,250
Defusing this
situation is my job.

190
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,458
And unless I'm mistaken,

191
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,166
there's another job
to which you're suited.

192
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,625
[KIRIGIRI]
I understand.

193
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,208
Do what you can for Naegi.
Just be careful.

194
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:55,000
[ASAHINA] Um! I volunteer
to go with you, sir!

195
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,541
[USAMI] Me, too! I've already
calculated the safest route!

196
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,250
[TENGAN]
Mh-hm!

197
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,541
Ah, Mister Mitarai?

198
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,083
[MITARAI]
Uh. Yes?

199
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:07,583
If you would, I believe Kirigiri
would appreciate an escort.

200
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,708
She's in no condition
to be alone.

201
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,416
Um. Absolutely!

202
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,000
[chuckles]

203
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:17,250
Very well, then.
Let's see what we can't do.

204
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:25,666
[KIRIGIRI]
It's you.

205
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,916
[KIZAKURA]
Huh?

206
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,583
Ah-ha! Kirigiri. Good to
see you. Come to detect?

207
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,875
[KIRIGIRI]
What are you doing here?

208
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,625
[KIZAKURA]
Meh. Times like these,

209
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:38,375
I figure the safest place to be
is with a world class sleuth.

210
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,625
Oh. Hey, come on now.

211
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,750
[TENGAN] There's nothing like
love to drive a man crazy.

212
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,166
You've been running
yourself ragged

213
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,083
from the moment we
found Yukizome's body.

214
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,208
Chuusen, is it?
He's going old-school.

215
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,291
Asahina, you're up.

216
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,666
Oh, right!

217
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,541
[ASAHINA]
Naegi!

218
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,333
[NAEGI yells]

219
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,458
[USAMI]
Uh, Mr. Chairman?

220
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,500
Don't worry about me.
I can hold my own.

221
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,916
Get the boy somewhere safe.

222
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,625
You got it, sir!

223
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:23,750
[TENGAN]
Naegi.

224
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,208
Yes, Chairman?

225
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,291
For what it's worth,
there's no doubt in my mind

226
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,583
you are the Super High
School-Level Hope.

227
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,708
[growls]

228
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:37,166
Go on. I'm leaving the others
in your capable hands.

229
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,541
Sir, you--

230
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,208
[TENGAN]
Hm.

231
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,625
I'll be fine.

232
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:44,541
Munakata and I are just
having a friendly discussion.

233
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,083
Thank you, Tengan.

234
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,291
[ASAHINA]
Let's go!

235
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,875
[MITARAI] Excuse me.
May I ask you something?

236
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,375
I'm curious.

237
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,958
What would you say
about the kind of person

238
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,291
who comes up with
a game like this?

239
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,291
There's not enough
information to go on yet.

240
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,333
Preconceptions get in
the way of clear thinking.

241
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:14,750
Oh.

242
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,041
What's your opinion?

243
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,583
Mine?

244
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:21,250
Fair question. You must have
a few ideas of your own.

245
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,583
I assume that's why

246
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,916
you're fielding someone
else's take on the matter.

247
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,750
I guess so...

248
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,708
[gasps]

249
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,500
Gotcha, you bastard.

250
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:52,708
Munakata!

251
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,250
Don't get involved.

252
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,333
[JUZO]
Screw that!

253
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,750
I'll handle it.

254
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:57,666
[JUZO]
C'mon!

255
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,916
Wanna help? Follow Naegi!

256
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,250
[JUZO]
Yeah, fine.

257
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,208
Sure about this?

258
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,291
As you wish.
Let's get on with it!

259
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,000
[SOHNOSUKE]
Ruruka.

260
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,125
You go first. Make a run for it.

261
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,958
I'm not leaving you!

262
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,958
[screams]

263
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:46,166
[RURUKA] Stop it. Damn it,
Seiko! What's wrong with you?

264
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,166
We used to be besties!

265
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,375
Don't even go there!

266
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,791
It's way too late for
you to try and play

267
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,291
the nostalgia card, sweetheart.

268
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,208
Last I checked, besties
don't let you get expelled

269
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,541
from Hope's Peak High School!

270
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,708
[growls]

271
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,916
Ruruka, please! Get out of here!

272
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,916
[SEIKO] Leaving him
all alone, are we? Agh!

273
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,166
What're you waiting for?

274
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,250
That's the sort of thing
a traitor does, right?

275
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,750
Don't project your
issues on me!

276
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,500
Quit being self righteous!

277
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,833
We got booted out of
there too, y'know!

278
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,916
And it's probably fair to say
we caught a lot more flack!

279
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,291
[SEIKO]
Oh, boo-hoo.

280
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,083
Traitors!

281
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,166
[SOHNOSUKE]
Are you okay?

282
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,041
[RURUKA]
Mh-hm.

283
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,458
Thanks, Yoi.

284
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,208
[laughs]

285
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,625
[SEIKO]
You can run, but you can't hide!

286
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:48,750
[yells]

287
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,958
[yells]

288
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,416
[TENGAN]
Heh. Surprised?

289
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,083
So steely eyed.

290
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,333
What is it about being young

291
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,875
that makes one so
susceptible to fanaticism?

292
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,250
Really, you're so
deeply cynical,

293
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,416
but at the same time, so naïve.

294
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,416
A very dangerous combination.
It'll cost lives!

295
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,000
[MUNAKATA] A regrettable price
to pay, but necessary!

296
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,000
Despair can only be
annihilated by those

297
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,833
willing to make sacrifices!

298
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,416
Ah, is that a fact?

299
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,791
So then I take it Yukizome
was one of those sacrifices?

300
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:34,833
[growls]

301
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,458
You're even more
confused than I thought.

302
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:04,291
[ASAHINA] I think we're...
far enough that we're safe.

303
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,291
I'm sorry.

304
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,041
[ASAHINA]
Why are you apologizing?

305
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,625
Something wrong?

306
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,625
[USAMI] I'm afraid
someone's following us.

307
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,291
Fear not! I'll put
a stop to them!

308
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,166
Don't try to be a hero!
What'll you do?

309
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,833
And where is this
even coming from?

310
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,416
[USAMI] I think Naegi's positive
outlook might be catching.

311
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,958
I'm infected with Hope!

312
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,708
Uh. Wait! Hold on a second.

313
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,166
[USAMI] One of us has to fight,
and since we can't risk tripping

314
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,083
either of your Forbidden
Actions, it'll have to be me.

315
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:40,666
Have a little faith in your
soul mate. My body is ready!

316
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,375
When this is all over, we are
gonna go eat so many donuts!

317
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,166
And that's a promise.

318
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,166
[USAMI]
I'll be back!

319
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,250
[USAMI]
Fire!

320
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,666
[chuckles]

321
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,958
[MUNAKATA]
Glad you find this amusing.

322
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:44,083
[TENGAN] Given our
current state of affairs,

323
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:48,625
I'd say Lady Luck favored
one of us over the other.

324
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,291
I always thought you
were just some old fool

325
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,625
cowering behind
a veil of ethics.

326
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:58,333
Frightened, leaving me to
shoulder the burden by myself.

327
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:01,250
I've been ready to
kill you for a while.

328
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,208
But...

329
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,875
Do go on.

330
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,500
I've had a change of heart.

331
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,208
I thought you'd lost your
fangs a long time ago,

332
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,250
but evidently that couldn't
be further from the truth.

333
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:17,000
I want to know what's
going on in your head.

334
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,333
[TENGAN]
Hm.

335
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,958
[JUZO]
She's gone completely postal!

336
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,000
[USAMI]
Congrats on surviving that,

337
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,791
but I fear this is the end.

338
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:33,375
Prepare to be obliterated by
my Seven Secret Weapons!

339
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,125
[USAMI]
Behold Secret Weapon Number One!

340
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,416
Or as I like to call it...

341
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,166
[USAMI]
Ow!

342
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:08,166
[MONAKA]
Aw, gimme a break! Come on!

343
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,208
Dang it! Great,
now I have to reboot.

344
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,208
Boo!

345
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,291
[chuckles]

346
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,500
That's super-duper
Despair-inducing.
