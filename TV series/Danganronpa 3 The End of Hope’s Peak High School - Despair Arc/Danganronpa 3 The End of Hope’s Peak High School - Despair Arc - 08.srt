[KIZAKURA] So far so good,
all things considered.

We're the only two
left alive, aren't we?

[KIZAKURA]
Yep.

4
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,000
[KIZAKURA] Y'know,
I used to be teacher, right?

5
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:28,000
So this ain't exactly
my area of expertise.

00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,958
No kidding? Same here.

7
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,375
I was a gym teacher
back in the day.

8
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,375
I'm not surprised.

Heh. You, uh, oughta think
about doing this for a livin'.

[AGENT A]
No thanks.

11
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,666
I'm more cut out for
the educator's life.

12

What about you?

13
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,708
[KIZAKURA]
Eh. I was reasonably terrible.

14

Loved the hell
out of it, though.

you this long to notice?

who the Attacker might be?

It's a work in progress.

[HAGAKURE] Wow.
Thanks for cuttin' me a break.

160
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,583
'Preciate it.

161
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,166
[HAGAKURE groans]

162
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,375
[HAGAKURE] Can't we storm
the place already?

163
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,791
Bet Naegi's coolin' his jets

164
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,125
while we're all out here
bustin' our humps.

165
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,416
[TOGAMI] There's no reason to
assume our friends are cozy.

166
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,083
[HAGAKURE]
I didn't say they were,

167
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,375
but at least they
got each other.

168
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,000
Safety in numbers!

169
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,458
[TOGAMI]
Hmph.

170
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,458
[TOGAMI]
Stay alive, my old comrades.

171
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,541
Don't you dare die before
I can come to the rescue.

172
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,125
Kyoko Kirigiri.

173
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:32,291
I screwed up lettin' you
get away earlier. Not again.

174
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,333
Really?

175
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:39,583
Do yourself a favor.
Have the sense to stay down.

176
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:40,833
Take my word for it.

177
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,958
I'd love nothin' better
than to play possum.

178
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,666
But hell, I'm the oldest
one here by a mile.

179
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,625
Etiquette dictates
I'm responsible

180
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,500
for how we slug this out.

181
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,833
Speaking of which,
I can't help but notice

182
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:56,333
you feel obliged to use a knife,
Mr. Former Boxer.

183
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,250
I think your Forbidden
Action prohibits you

184
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,625
from throwing a punch!

185
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:03,208
Hit one of us and it's
curtains for ya! Maybe.

186
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,250
Doesn't mean I can't
eviscerate you.

187
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,875
[KIZAKURA] Wait, are you
saying I got it right, or--?

188
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,291
How 'bout I tell you
my Forbidden Action?

189
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:14,375
Why not? We'll treat it like
a trust-building exercise.

190
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,791
You can see it, right? Hold on,
she's coming around again.

191
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,333
I'm not allowed to
open my left hand.

192
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,583
Why bother tellin' me this?

193
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,416
You pullin' a fast
one or somethin'?

194
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,250
[KIZAKURA]
Face the facts, big stuff.

195
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,125
Punching is what you do best.

196
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,666
As far as I know, it's the
one thing you're good at.

197
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,000
And I'm all about whatever
levels the playing field.

198
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,000
Must suck for Munakata.

199
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,125
Without Chisa,
all he has to rely on

200
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,875
is a gorilla with roid-rage.

201
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,500
I'm startin' to think no one
actually likes the guy.

202
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,083
Sorry. I'm talkin' about
the Vice Chairman.

203
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:51,208
[JUZO] You are not even worthy
of speaking that man's name.

204
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,458
You can stand there or
do something about it.

205
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,833
Oh, that's right, your track
record's been a joke

206
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:56,583
where that's concerned.

207
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,250
Don't you dare go there!

208
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,833
Yeah, I dropped the ball,

209
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,625
but I'll be damned if I make
the same mistake twice!

210
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,041
I gave Munakata my vow!

211
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,208
[yells]

212
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:12,541
Aah. That one's on me.
I forgot it was there.

213
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,541
Sorry. Stupid traps.

214
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,333
[KIZAKURA sighs]

215
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,250
[KIZAKURA] Feels like today
woulda been a good time

216
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,250
for me to buy a lottery ticket.

217
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,708
Wait, so, you were
trying to lead him

218
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,500
to that exact spot
the whole time?

219
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,875
Let's say, sure.

220
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,041
I suggest we take this
opportunity to tie him up.

221
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,583
I assume you wanna
keep investigating.

222
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,333
Right. Back to it, then.

223
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,208
[chuckles]

224
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:43,958
[KIRIGIRI gasps]

225
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,791

226
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,416

[growls]

228
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,916
[KIRIGIRI]
Kizakura, why?

229
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:40,458
[JIN] Sweetie, stop being
such a wiggle worm. Heh.

230
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,750
Up you go!

231
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,791
Hey, look at me! I'm a birdie!

232
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,250
[JIN]
I know!

233
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,666
[KIZAKURA] Come on, guys.
You want the picture or not?

234
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,625
Stay still.

235
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,041
Perfect.

236
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,875
[KIZAKURA]
Huh.

237
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,750
[KIZAKURA]
What do ya know...

238
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,250
I was a man of my word.

239
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,541
Jin...

240
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,458
[MITARAI]
This was all you, wasn't it?!

241
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,666
You've got something planned!

242
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,250
[RURUKA]
Um, yeah.

243
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,458
The idea is to kill all of you.

244
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,916
Now there's only two people
left to worry about.

245
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,125
This one, I need.

246
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,166
Aw, poor baby. Let's fix you up.

247
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:52,166
Yeah, you love a taste of the
sweet stuff, don't ya, big boy?

248
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:58,125
Of course you do.
Well? Would you like another?

249
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,416
I thought so.

250
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,000
Take care of our
friends, won't you?

251
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,208
Kill them both, and you can
have all the chocolate

252
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,250
your widdle heart desires.

253
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,916
Enough to last you
the rest of your life.

254
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,375
No! You stay away from us!

255
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,916
He's not listening.

256
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,458
His head's too filled with
thoughts of sweet, sweet candy

257
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,333
to give a damn
what anybody says.

258
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,791
Except of course the person
who'll give him his next hit.

259
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,125
[groaning]

260
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,333
[gasps]

261
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,333
[JUZO]
Ow.

262
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,083
Damn you all to hell!

263
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:49,041
You miserable,
conniving pieces of crap!

264
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,583
I'm no one's puppet.

265
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,208
Get ready to join
Izayoi and Kizakura!

266
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,583
Every last one of you bastards!

267
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,250
[KIRIGIRI]
Just a moment.

268
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,583
[JUZO]
Huh?

269
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,750
I understand why you've
been acting so bizarrely.

270
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,083
[JUZO]
What?

271
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:05,291
It wasn't the Attacker who
killed Sohnosuke Izayoi.

272
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,875
It was you.

273
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,666
[yelps]

274
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,125
Yeah?

275
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,333
I don't care who did what to
who, you're all gonna die.

276
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,791
Right here, right now,
by my hands!

277
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,583
You could do that.

278
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,333
You could also use your head.

279
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,166
Why resort to wholesale violence

280
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,916
when solving this particular
murder might actually present us

281
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,375
with a means of escape?

282
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,666
Don't you agree, Andoh?

283
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,916
What're you talking about?

284
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,583
The Attacker's the
one who killed Yoi.

285
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,625
[KIRIGIRI]
Wrong.

286
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,333
The crime scene was
carefully staged

287
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,583
to give us that impression.

288
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:40,708
In reality, he was killed
by his Forbidden Action.

289
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,291
Most traces of the poison's
effects were concealed,

290
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,750
but not all.

291
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:48,041
To a keen observer, his corpse
left no room for doubt.

292
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,041
Don't be ridiculous!
There's a knife in his chest!

293
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,375
[KIRIGIRI]
Put there after he died.

294
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:56,416
Originally, the knife came
from Kimura's body.

295
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,416
Wait, you tellin' me
Kimura's dead?

296
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,958
Yes. Dispatched by a solitary
stab wound to the heart.

297
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,833
We found her body
not far from here.

298
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,791
At this point, the Attacker has
claimed multiple victims,

299
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,541
each killed in the
exact same manner.

300
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,958
However, in Izayoi's case,
the MO deviated.

301
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,416
The stab wound wasn't
in the typical place,

302
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,125
and the body showed
no signs of blood loss.

303
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:24,000
In other words, our friend here
was stabbed after he died.

304
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:27,333
The killer used the knife from
Kimura's body to throw us off.

305
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:31,291
[JUZO] So the Attacker got
Kimura, but not Izayoi.

306
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,791
You're sure of that?

307
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:36,791
Indeed. Absolutely positive.

308
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:40,166
Okay. Then explain.

309
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,625
Izayoi's Forbidden
Action was eating.

310
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,583
If the knife wasn't
responsible, well then,

311
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,666
by deception or
against his will,

312
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,625
he was fed something and
poisoned by his bangle.

313
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,166
And since...

314
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,625
...his saliva tasted sweet,

315
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:59,166
we can deduce from this he ate
one of Andoh's confections.

316
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,000
You licked... saliva?
From a body?

317
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,083
Yes, I did.

318
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,000
A detective does
what's necessary.

319
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,083
He was shrewd.
Not a man to trifle with.

320
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,750
Getting him to eat
must've been difficult.

321
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:16,541
But you, a specialist
who deals in sweets,

322
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,500
with whom he was
exceptionally close...

323
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,833
How can you blame me?

324
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,916
Yoi was on my side!
Why would I have killed him?

325
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,875
The motive is clear.

326
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,166
[gasps]

327
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,625
Just as I thought.

328
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,958
[JUZO]
Wha--? What the--?

329
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,750
[MITARAI] A secret entrance?
But how did you know?

330
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,125
[KIRIGIRI]
The scuff marks on the floor.

331
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:56,750
And one shelf wasn't
flush with the rest.

332
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,000
Put those observations together,

333
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,375
and there's only handful
of possibilities.

334
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,750
[JUZO] So does this mean
we got a way outta here?

335
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,333
Given where it's
situated, I'd say yes.

336
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:11,125
This ought to lead to
the building's exterior.

337
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,833
'Course, that's assuming the
architectural plan makes sense.

338
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,375
Great! So you found a way out!

339
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,791
None of this gives me
a reason to kill him!

340
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,166
Under normal
circumstances, I'd agree.

341
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,041
But the rules of this game
compel us to do certain things

342
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,541
for which there'd
be no rationale

343
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,208
under normal circumstances.

344
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,791
Ruruka Andoh.

345
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,291
Tell us the truth.

346
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,666
Your Forbidden Action

347
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,750
is letting someone leave
the playing field, isn't it?

348
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,500
That's absolutely absurd.

349
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,750
Ah.

350
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,333
So when Izayoi stumbled
upon what appeared to be

351
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,916
an exit in this room,

352
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,708
his attempting to leave didn't
put you in fear of your life?

353
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:49,958
[RURUKA]
No!

354
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,916
You don't know anything!
He'd never betray me!

355
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,625
But you'd betray him.

356
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:58,791
That's it, I'm out. This stupid
game can kiss my ass.

357
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
[RURUKA]
No, stop!

358
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,958
If you leave, I'm a dead woman!

359
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,791
[JUZO] Yeah? I should
give a damn because?

360
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,500
[RURUKA]
Please! I'm begging you! Look...

361
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,291
That did the trick. Let's go.

362
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,083
But wait. The exit.

363
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,875
[RURUKA]
Wait! Wait!

364
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,125
[JUZO]
Let go of me! Now!

365
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,791
[RURUKA]
No! I don't deserve this!

366
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,458
Um.

367
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:30,666
Go on.

368
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,250
I don't understand why
Kizakura saved you.

369
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:38,833
I mean... he sacrificed
himself. For what?

370
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,750
[KIRIGIRI]
I have my suspicions,

371
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:45,375
but at this point,
it's all conjecture.

372
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,333
Wow, you really are cold.

373
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,375
[KIRIGIRI]
I know.

374
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,041
Buddy of mine hates detectives.

375
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,208
[KIRIGIRI]
I have to be.

376
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,125
[KIRIGIRI]
I'm a detective.

377
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:41,375
[AGENT B]
Clear!

378
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,625
[AGENT B]
There's our way in.

379
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,666
[HAGAKURE]
Yeah! We did it!

380
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,750
[HAGAKURA laughs]

381
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,833
Begging your pardon.

382
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,166
I have to ask you
to stay out here.

383
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,708
[HAGAKURE]
Uh?

384
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:00,958
[AGENT B]
All right, take your...

385
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,458
[TOGAMI]
Ugh. The air in this place.

386
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,583
Reminds me of Hope's Peak.

387
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,583
--[AGENT B] Hey! Are you okay?
--Stop! Don't touch anything!

388
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:13,416
You idiot!

389
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,458
[alarm blares]

390
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:24,416
[NAEGI]
Never again.

391
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,375
I'm not letting them
kill anyone else!

392
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,500
What the--?

393
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,875
That felt pretty big!
