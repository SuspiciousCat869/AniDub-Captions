[yelps]

3
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:23,125
What the--?
What made that noise?

4
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,416
[KIRIGIRI]
Yeah, don't help me or anything.

5
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:30,125
How did you get here?
What're you even doing?

6
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,541
Call it a rescue mission.

7
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,791
One I thought would
be fairly obvious.

8
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,291
[chuckles]

9
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:36,541
[NAEGI]
Uh.

10
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,666
Sorry, but uh,

11
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,041
you have a little
something on your head.

12
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,875
You need to eat something.

13
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,833
We'll talk afterward.

14
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:57,375
You're a life saver!

15
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,666
There, see?

16
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,625
And just like that he's
back at full throttle.

17
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,458
Well, I don't know about
all that, but I guess,

18
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:08,250
bein' rescued does kinda put
a little spring in my step.

19
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:11,708
I have to say, optimism
definitely becomes you.

20
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:23,833
[ASAHINA crying]

21
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,416
[NAEGI]
Why?

22
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,083
You could have...

23
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:36,333
Why didn't you say something?!

24
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:42,041
[NAEGI]
Kirigiri...

25
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,791
Kyoko, no!

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,416
Not her.

27
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,208
[microphone hums]

28
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,458
[MUNAKATA]
Makoto Naegi.

29
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,166
[MUNAKATA]
If you're awake,

30
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:09,291
I assume you've discovered what
Kirigiri's Forbidden Action was.

31
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,583
Do you understand now?

32
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,083
Do you see the truth?

33
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:17,375
Your platitudes are useless.

34
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,875
[MUNAKATA]
It's time to cast them aside.

35
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:26,708
Time to settle once and
for all who's Hope is real.

36
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,041
Yours or mine.

37
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,916
Whatever happens next,

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,833
promise not to turn
your back on Hope.

39
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:47,625
I'm on your side.
Don't ever forget that.

40
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:56,291
[ASAHINA crying]

41
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,000
Wait, what're you--?

42
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,500
I'm going to confront Munakata.

43
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:16,083
Once and for all.
This bloodshed has to end.

44
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,000
The man's insane!

45
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:22,333
Do me a favor. I'd like
you to stay with Asahina.

46
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,666
So that's it?
You're walking away?

47
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,708
You're just gonna leave
Kirigiri's body here?

48
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:30,333
I thought the two of you were
supposed to be friends!

49
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,916
She's dead!

50
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,041
How can you brush something
like this off so easily?

51
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,875
I'm not just brushing it off.

52
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,291
I adored her.

53
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:48,166
She saved my life
more than once.

54
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,041
She kept her Forbidden
Action secret

55
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:54,375
so I wouldn't do...
something rash.

56
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,416
She died protecting
me from myself.

57
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:03,125
Kirigiri entrusted me
with her last hope.

58
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:07,791
So I'll fight. I'll push
forward to honor her.

59
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,958
Go for it.

60
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:17,083
I believe in you.
Give it all you've got.

61
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,708
Wait here.

62
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,625
Whatever happens next,

63
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,541
promise not to turn
your back on Hope.

64
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:46,833
Don't you worry. It's what I do.

65
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,625
Blind optimism.

66
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:04,125
[YUKIZOME crying]

67
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:10,291
[YUKIZOME]
I tried... I did.

68
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:14,625
By the time I got here,
they were...

69
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:19,041
Who...? Who would
do such a thing?

70
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:23,208
Why does this keep happening?
When is it going to stop?

71
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,416
Talk to me, Kyosuke.

72
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,000
What can we do to end all this?
How can we annihilate Despair?

73
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,750
[MUNAKATA]
You leave that to me.

74
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,708
[NAEGI]
Perk up. You're far from alone.

75
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:45,208
The Hope you carry was
given to you by everyone.

76
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:49,458
[MUNAKATA] If I must be the last
soul alive on earth, so be it.

77
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,083
Despair shall be vanquished.

78
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:56,083
[NAEGI] That's how it works,
how Hope gets passed on.

79
00:08:56,166 --> 00:09:00,291
[MUNAKATA] Despair infects
and spreads like a virus.

80
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,666
Every potential host must die.

81
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,875
Makoto Naegi, this is
an act of compassion.

82
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:13,208
[NAEGI]
Munakata, one way or another....

83
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,083
[MUNAKATA]
I will save you.

84
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,041
[NAEGI]
...I will stop you.

85
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,791
[MUNAKATA]
So you've come.

86
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,500
[NAEGI]
That's right.

87
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,333
No second guessing. No stalling.

88
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:37,208
[MUNAKATA] I've never had
the luxury of uncertainty.

89
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,875
[NAEGI] There's no point
in us killing each other.

90
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,916
I've come to ask for your help.

91
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,041
We can end this game together.

92
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,208
[MUNAKATA]
Your words carry no weight.

93
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,458
I've told you this.

94
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,791
We're dancing in circles here.

95
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,875
You couldn't be more wrong.

96
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,500
What door could he
possibly want me to choose?

97
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,583
[MITARAI]
How can someone be so strong?

98
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,916
And why am I so weak?

99
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,500
I'm never gonna be worth a damn.

100
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,791
Oh, Kyoko...

101
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,291
[MUNAKATA] Is this where
you'd prefer to end it?

102
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,250
[NAEGI]
So close.

103
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,458
[MUNAKATA]
Hmph.

104
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,708
[MUNAKATA] If you intend to
take your quarry by surprise,

105
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,791
don't leave a trail of blood.

106
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,958
I'm not done.

107
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,041
What? Come on!

108
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,791
Doesn't seem to work.

109
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:47,458
I'd say your notorious lucky
streak has run its course.

110
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,000
[MUNAKATA coughing]

111
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,166
Damn! Where's he gone now?

112
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,375
[yells]

113
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,375
[yells]

114
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,541
[yells]

115
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,166
Damn you, Makoto Naegi.

116
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,708
Why'd you stop?

117
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,916
You can't kill me, can you?

118
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,416
I knew you would be
drawn to this place.

119
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,833
After all, we've
been here before.

120
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,166
The first time,
you let me get away.

121
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,666
And when you cornered me
in the Monitoring room,

122
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,000
you broke the glass to get in.

123
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,125
I found out your
Forbidden Action.

124
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,958
You can't open doors.

125
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,666
That's the reason you
can't kill me right now.

126
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,625
If you did, you'd be
trapped in here.

127
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:40,291
Now then, can we please talk?

128
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,083
[MUNAKATA]
There's no point.

129
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,583
Listen, I'll make
you a deal, all right?

130
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,625
Hear me out and I'll open
the door. I promise.

131
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,333
[MUNAKATA]
Enough! You're the enemy!

132
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,708
No, I'm not! Believe me!

133
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,750
[MUNAKATA] When did Despair
first get its hooks into you?

134
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,916
Was it the Mutual Killing
Game at Hope's Peak

135
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,291
that seduced you into darkness?

136
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,916
[NAEGI]
No.

137
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,166
Listen, I'm not on
the side of Despair!

138
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,916
Don't lie to me.

139
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,250
We shouldn't have been at odds.

140
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:39,208
We can beat this...
Together... As a team.

141
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,041
You keep saying that.

142
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,041
Need I remind you while
you paid lip service

143
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:47,041
to vacuous platitudes,
your friend Kirigiri died!

144
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,541
You still don't get it?

145
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:55,416
Someone you loved gave her life
upholding your naïve ideals!

146
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,125
Despair must die.

147
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,500
Doesn't matter who
the mastermind is.

148
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,958
I will do whatever must
be done to thwart them.

149
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:07,000
No sacrifice is too dear.
No cost too great.

150
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,083
That is true Hope!

151
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,083
That's not true.

152
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,916
That isn't Hope!

153
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,583
Listen to yourself!

154
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:28,583
All you're talking about is
ending Despair, that's it!

155
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:33,333
Even if that's possible,
it's not the same!

156
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:37,125
You've got tunnel vision.
Despair's all you can see.

157
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,583
Where's Hope? It's not even
part of the equation!

158
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,250
Don't turn this around.

159
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,166
Chairman Tengan
told me everything.

160
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,541
This is not the time or place

161
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,250
for a mental sparring
match, Chairman.

162
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,375
Which one of them is
the actual Attacker?

163
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,333
[TENGAN]
As I've said, if you're asking,

164
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:59,083
I have no choice but
to answer honestly.

165
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,833
There's more than one.

166
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:05,000
We're all of us responsible.
The entire Foundation.

167
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,666
In a manner of speaking, every
single member is the Attacker.

168
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,333
[gasps]

169
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:17,541
[TENGAN] Me, Naegi,
Sakakura, even Yukizome.

170
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,625
None of us are exempt.

171
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,416
How does it feel, friend?

172
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,750
Even the love of your
life was tainted.

173
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:29,333
Not one soul is left
uncorrupted by Despair.

174
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,500
Does that change your tactic?

175
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:35,166
Will you still do everything in
your power to annihilate it?

176
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,166
[MUNAKATA]
Is that...? Is that true?

177
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,708
I'm afraid so.

178
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:54,416
[MUNAKATA] In my heart, I know
what Tengan said was true.

179
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,750
All of us are tainted.

180
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,916
In the end, even
Yukizome gave in.

181
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,666
[MUNAKATA] When the
children died, she asked me,

182
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,166
"Who could do such a thing?"

183
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,500
And I was fool.

184
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:24,458
She answered her own
question in a photograph.

185
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,833
She was the one responsible.

186
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:39,541
When did it happen?
When did she first succumb?

187
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,958
I once believed her immune.

188
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,416
[MUNAKATA]
It doesn't matter.

189
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,458
Every trace of
Despair shall burn.

190
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,666
Even the memory of it
will turn to ash.

191
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,416
[NAEGI] Stop talking like that!
She was a person!

192
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,166
She meant something to you.

193
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:05,916
I don't care what she did!
She's worth more!

194
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You know nothing! Nothing!

195
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,583
[MUNAKATA] Nothing!
Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!

196
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,500
Nothing! Nothing!

197
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,291
[NAEGI]
Yes I do!

198
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,000
I know...

199
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:24,458
If Kirigiri had
turned to Despair...

200
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,750
...betrayed every last
one of us...

201
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:32,125
...I know, even if I had
to resort to killing her,

202
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,958
I would always be grateful
for the person she was.

203
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,458
I'd always think
of her as someone

204
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,083
I couldn't possibly
have lived without!

205
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,791
[YUKIZOME]
Kyosuke.

206
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,083
[YUKIZOME]
Say what you will,

207
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:55,625
Hope's Peak High School is
what brought us together.

208
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:59,416
Think about it, I bet we'd never
even have met otherwise.

209
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,583
Chisa...

210
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,458
When? How did it happen?

211
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:31,875
[screaming]

212
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:46,416
[MUNAKATA crying]

213
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,666
I'm sorry, Kyosuke.

214
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,666
[MUNAKATA]
Where did we go wrong?

215
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,125
How could I have known it
would all end up like this?

216
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,291
[door opens]

217
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,750
[ASAHINA]
Naegi!

218
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,000
[ASAHINA]
Oh my God, are you okay?

219
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,000
You're not really
that good at waiting.

220
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,166
[ASAHINA grunts]

221
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,500
The killing is over!
Do you hear me?

222
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,958
I know who the Attacker is.
It's all here.
