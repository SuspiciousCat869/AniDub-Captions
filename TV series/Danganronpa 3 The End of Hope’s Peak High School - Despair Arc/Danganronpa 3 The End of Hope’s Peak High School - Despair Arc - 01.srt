00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:14,583
[MUNAKATA]
Makoto Naegi

2
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,958
of Future Foundation
Branch Office Fourteen.

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,458
Dear boy.
We hereby arrest you...

4
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,125
...for treason.

5
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:45,541
[KIRIGIRI] Not long ago,
mankind was all but destroyed.

6
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:48,583
Driven to the brink by the
Biggest, Most Atrocious,

7
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:54,041
Despair-Inducing Incident
in Human History.

8
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,375
A terrorist group dubbed

9
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,833
the "Super High
School-Level Despairs"

10
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:02,583
launched a series of coordinated
attacks across the globe.

11
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:06,875
They made no declaration.
Issued no demands.

12
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,416
True to its name,

13
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,708
the organization's sole
purpose was to sow Despair.

14
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,083
[KIRIGIRI] But like a
phoenix from the ashes,

15
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,125
humanity's last Hope
rose to fight

16
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:31,333
the Super High
School-Level Despairs.

17
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:34,625
They were called the
Future Foundation.

18
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:37,500
Skilled warriors were
recruited worldwide,

19
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,583
but Foundation members
consisted largely

20
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:43,125
of alumni from Hope's
Peak High School.

21
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:45,750
They fought desperately
against the Despairs,

22
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,500
struggling to keep
darkness at bay.

23
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:10,416
[KIRIGIRI]
The battle raged on and on,

24
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,083
but with the death of Junko
Enoshima, who started it all,

25
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,833
the tide turned
in favor of Hope.

26
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:28,416
[KIRIGIRI] Still, the
Remnants of Despair carry on.

27
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,583
Still the flames of war burn.

28
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,208
Still lives are snuffed out.

29
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,291
[TENGAN]
Well, well.

30
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,916
'S been quite a while since
we've gathered like this.

31
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,166
[GOZU] So, boss, I assume
since we're all here...

32
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,750
You assume correctly.

33
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:59,125
This is in regards to
Makoto Naegi's betrayal.

34
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,458
Ugh.

35
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,416
If the lower echelons
get wind of this,

36
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,333
there'll be hell to pay.

37
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,625
Yeah, but when you
think about it,

38
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,625
isn't that sort of
the entire point?

39
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,208
[RURUKA]
Hmm.

40
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,583
Chairman Tengan, sir, doesn't
this seem just a tad dangerous?

41
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,291
If someone attacked
this place right now,

42
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,916
they could take out
the whole board.

43
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,125
Here. Say "ah."

44
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,333
So good.

45
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,416
[TENGAN] Eh. I don't think
there's any cause to worry.

46
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,666
No, Munakata constructed
this building himself.

47
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,041
We're perfectly safe.

48
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,416
As far as official
maps are concerned,

49
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,166
this little island is only
so much more ocean.

50
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,083
[BANDAI] I'll bet dolphins
and deer live together

51
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,750
inside the pine trees.

52
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,208
[SEIKO]
Do what?

53
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,416
Oh, that's great.
So we're not on the map.

54
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,041
Is that really a
hindrance to people

55
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,625
who almost ended civilization?

56
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,916
[GOZU] The Remnants of Despair
are just that. Remnants.

57
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
They've been quiet lately.

58
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,083
[JUZO]
Are you out of your mind?

59
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,625
There've been 40 attacks
this month alone.

60
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,500
You call that being quiet?

61
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,708
I think somebody's
forgotten how to count.

62
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,625
[GOZU] Compared to when
they were at their peak.

63
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,375
Look, buddy, numbers
aren't the issue here.

64
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,583
The issue is that they're alive
and kickin' in the first place!

65
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,250
That's bad news any
way you slice it!

66
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,708
With respect, Chairman Tengan,

67
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,500
I'm pretty sure I know
what the old you

68
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,750
would've had to say
about all this.

69
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:20,208
Twiddling our thumbs will only
increase the body count.

70
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:23,541
The Remnants of Despair
must be exterminated.

71
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,083
Our solution is clear.

72
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,583
Wipe the bastards
and their allies

73
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,916
off the face of the Earth!

74
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,291
[GOZU]
You know it's not that simple.

75
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,833
[KIZAKURA]
There are budgetary concerns.

76
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,416
[SEIKO]
They have to be dealt with.

77
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,416
If you don't cut off the rotten
bits, the whole thing spoils.

78
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,083
[BANDAI] After all,
a dancing wolf needs sakè.

79
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,208
[RURUKA] What does
anything you say mean?

80
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:47,041
[SEIKO] I've been curious
about that myself.

81
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,291
Just my own personal
expressions, y'know?

82
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,916
They don't mean anything.

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
[RURUKA] Then stop using
them all the time!

84
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:56,458
It's bad enough hearing that
voice coming out of that face.

85
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,875
[SEIKO]
Creepy.

86
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,000
Aww.

87
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,291
[SOHNOSUKE]
Ruruka does have a point.

88
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,333
[BANDAI]
That's so sweet!

89
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,916
[SEIKO]
It wasn't a compliment!

90
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,583
[JUZO] Okay, okay. We're gettin'
off topic. Let's maintain focus.

91
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:10,250
People, please. We can't
hold a conference like this.

92
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,833
[door opens]

93
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:18,958
[MUNAKATA] Ah. So this
is humanity's last Hope.

94
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:23,208
Even as we speak, the Remnants
of Despair are wreaking havoc.

95
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,791
Victim piles upon victim.

96
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,583
There's a time and place
for petty squabbles.

97
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,375
This isn't it.

98
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,458
[GOZU] You're in the presence
of the Chairman.

99
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,583
Restrain yourself.

100
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,083
[sighs]

101
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,000
I remember a time you
wouldn't let a meeting

102
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,708
deteriorate like this.

103
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:47,083
We're here to discuss
Makoto Naegi.

104
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,583
Let's get started. Yukizome?

105
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,208
Okay!

106
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,291
[MUNAKATA]
Are we all seated?

107
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:03,625
Good. Look at the main monitor.

108
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:04,958
These are Remnants of Despair

109
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,750
Makoto Naegi willfully
kept hidden.

110
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,833
[JUZO]
Junko Enoshima's servants.

111
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,625
They brought the
world to its knees.

112
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,625
[SOHNOSUKE] Aiding and
abetting is a serious crime.

113
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,458
[RURUKA]
These are the so-called

114
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,708
"million-class
murderers," correct?

115
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,916
What reason would Naegi have
for helping them evade justice?

116
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,750
[KIZAKURA] I'd like to know
the answer to that myself.

117
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,458
[JUZO] Why didn't we kill 'em
the second we knew

118
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:31,666
who they were?

119
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,541
This whole damn mess
could've been avoided.

120
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:38,500
Perhaps, but this is the young
man who stopped Enoshima.

121
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,250
The Super High
School-Level Hope himself.

122
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,166
It behooves us to talk it out.

123
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,375
[MUNAKATA] If he is in fact
worthy of the name.

124
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,500
[RURUKA] We have to at least
consider the possibility

125
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,916
that Enoshima's defeat
was a red herring.

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,916
For all we know, Naegi was
a mole for the Despairs.

127
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,750
[SOHNOSUKE]
Huh. Good theory.

128
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,083
Appearing to take
down their leader

129
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:00,458
would tend to deflect our
suspicions, wouldn't it?

130
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,625
[SEIKO] In that case,
I regret not having

131
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,375
a truth serum prepared
for the interrogation.

132
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,166
The details aren't clear.

133
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,416
But be that as it may,

134
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,958
we know he rescued
Despairs and deceived us.

135
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,041
[door opens]

136
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,083
[NAEGI]
Didn't meant to be late.

137
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,583
Forgive me.

138
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:24,000
Foundation Branch Fourteen.
Makoto Naegi.

139
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:35,875
[MUNAKATA]
Welcome. Good of you to join us.

140
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,958
Sakakura, place him
under arrest.

141
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,666
Wait a minute!
You can't do that!

142
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,125
You haven't even heard him out!

143
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,375
Asahina, don't.

144
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,416
[ASAHINA]
But...

145
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,875
[MUNAKATA]
Makoto Naegi

146
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:53,041
of Future Foundation
Branch Office Fourteen.

147
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,500
Dear boy. We hereby
arrest you for treason.

148
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,833
[JUZO]
This isn't personal.

149
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,875
It pains me to put
a hero in handcuffs,

150
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,333
but I'm afraid I don't
have much of a choice.

151
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,208
Actually. It was--

152
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,000
[ASAHINA]
Naegi!

153
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,666
Ah, hitting someone who
can't defend himself.

154
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,458
Is that Future Foundation
policy these days?

155
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,875
[JUZO]
Shut your mouth.

156
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,416
How many of our comrades
have you condemned?

157
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,125
He's a traitor. He's got no
right to defend himself!

158
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,500
Naegi, no!

159
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,333
This is outrageous! You should
be ashamed of yours--

160
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,458
[RURUKA]
That was a warning.

161
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,791
Shriek again and the next
one goes between your eyes.

162
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:37,000
[JUZO] Suck it up.
On your feet, you son of bitch.

163
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,208
[GOZU]
That'll be enough.

164
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,250
Get your grubby mitt off of me.

165
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,500
[GOZU] Passing sentence
without trial is lynching.

166
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,916
If you insist on
pursuing this course,

167
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,375
you will answer
to the Great Gozu!

168
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,375
Everyone settle down.

169
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,958
Tch.

170
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,000
Naegi, are you all right?

171
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,166
The defendant is badly wounded

172
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,625
and not in a position
to stand trial.

173
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,458
He needs time to recover.

174
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,916
[JUZO] Screw that.
I barely touched him.

175
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,250
[MUNAKATA]
Sakakura.

176
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,875
We want his testimony
to be reliable.

177
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,958
Let him recoup for now.
Trial suspended.

178
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:20,208
This counsel will reconvene
at a date to be specified.

179
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,541
Take him away.

180
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,583
[YUKIZOME humming]

181
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,791
Yukizome. Wouldn't you
rather take a break?

182
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,583
Call me Chisa.
We're alone, silly.

183
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,875
Go rest. Yukizome.

184
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,166
Okay!

185
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,750
What now?

186
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,791
Kyosuke. C'mon,
you're not tired?

187
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,708
I can't be the only one
who needs a rest.

188
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,208
You're the workaholic
between the two of us.

189
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,208
[gasps]

190
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,041
So that's how it's
gonna be, is it?

191
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,250
[sighs]

192
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,916
Fine. Whatever.

193
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,833
Listen--

194
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,958
Yeah, what?

195
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,875
It's... nothing.

196
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,416
Just go check on Naegi.

197
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,791
Sure. Can do. Bye bye!

198
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,416
Yeah.

199
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,083
[YUKIZOME humming]

200
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,875
[ASAHINA] We can't even
see him? That's ridiculous!

201
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,083
[sighs] It's a sign of
how little they trust us.

202
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,458
I wouldn't be surprised

203
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,541
if I'm suspected of working
in collusion with Naegi

204
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,083
to hide the Remnants.

205
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,333
Sure, but still.

206
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,750
I'm sorry.

207
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,333
You'll be treated as a
co-conspirator too at this rate.

208
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,541
Long as we're in this
boat together, I guess.

209
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,250
It's natural for me
to come under scrutiny.

210
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:53,250
I'm his boss. It's just
part of the bargain.

211
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,916
But I see no point for you
to stick your neck out.

212
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,416
[ASAHINA]
Don't even start with that!

213
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,041
We're in different Branches,
sure, but I can still help!

214
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,458
Some things never change, huh?

215
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,875
[ASAHINA] C'mon, Kyoko!
This is what friends do!

216
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,958
And besides, we've been
through worse, right?

217
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,458
[YUKIZOME]
This'll sting a teensy bit.

218
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,500
[NAEGI grunts]

219
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,791
No big. Hardly felt a thing.

220
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,958
Heh. You're such a boy.

221
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:25,000
So are you some
kinda doctor, or what?

222
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,583
I used to be a teacher
once upon a time.

223
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,333
Heh. Seems like another life.

224
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,916
I taught the people
you protected.

225
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,958
So did you know who you were
putting yourself out there for

226
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:40,291
or was their reputation
a mystery to you?

227
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,541
You had to have known
what they'd done.

228
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:48,041
[NAEGI]
I'm not entirely sure. But--

229
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,000
I mean, they didn't come into
the world the way they are.

230
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,416
They had hopes,

231
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,916
dreams they must've talked
about with their friends.

232
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,333
Hopes, huh?

233
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,333
I'm beginning to see where
your nickname comes from.

234
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:02,083
I, uh... didn't pick it
out for myself, believe me!

235
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:06,541
You and Munakata. He's the
Future Foundation's Hope.

236
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,583
I know.

237
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,125
[YUKIZOME] I don't think
the way you look at things

238
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:14,750
is necessarily wrong, but some
crimes are just too serious.

239
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,125
And which ones would
those be, I wonder.

240
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,583
[YUKIZOME]
Don't be naïve.

241
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,500
You can't kill the Remnants
of Despair with kindness.

242
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,041
The Foundation needs
men like Munakata.

243
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,708
Men who can do
what has to be done.

244
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,375
[NAEGI]
You may be right.

245
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,500
[YUKIZOME]
Hey.

246
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,958
What if two Hopes could
set aside their differences

247
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,125
and meet in the middle?

248
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,166
Think seeing 'em work together

249
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,958
would inspire an
even better Hope?

250
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,583
Well--

251
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,041
Look, I realize he
comes off a little cold.

252
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,500
But give him a chance.
He's a good person.

253
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,583
It'd mean a lot to me if
you could see his side.

254
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:59,708
[KIRIGIRI]
What's the matter?

00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:00,625
[gasps]

256
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,583
Um. Nothing.

257
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,500
I'm here for the big meeting
with Chairman Tengan.

258
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,166
Don't wanna just barge in.

259

[KIRIGIRI]
Excuse me, aren't you--?

260
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,833
Yes. Ryota Mitarai, and you're?

261
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,208
[MITARAI]
What's happening?

262
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,416
Uh-oh!

263
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:24,958
[bang]

264
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,166
[gasps]

265
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,500
[HAGAKURE]
This blows.

266
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,166
I'm s'posed to be
part of the team!

267
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,916
Why do I gotta wait out here?

Fine. Treat me like
an outside cat.

269
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,791
Who needs to sit
through a boring meeting

270
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,416
when you have an ultra
swanky crystal ball?

271
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,250
Let's see. Show me
the future, baby.

272
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,291
What lies in the store
for my pal, Naegi?

273
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,375
[HAGAKURE]
Well there we go.

274
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,250
Huh?

275
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,041
What the hell is that?

00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,083
Okay! Did not see that comin'!

277

[HAGAKURE]
Bogus! Another one?

278
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,375
[yelping]

279
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,416
[HAGAKURE]
Oh no! The entrance!

280
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,291
[YUKIZOME]
What's going on?

281
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:27,250
We're under attack.
Reports are just coming in now.

282
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,416
Specifics, Bandai.
What's the damage like?

283
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,750
Just a sec. Uh--

284
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,083
[YUKIZOME]
Oh my god.

285
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,833
[GOZU] The front entrance
is buried under rubble.

286
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,625
Not just the front
entrance, guys!

287
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,916
The rear entrance, the emergency
exits, elevators on all floors,

288
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,208
every possible way out of this
building has been obliterated!

289
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,333
I told you something
like this would happen!

290
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,875
You all swore no one
knew about this place!

291
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:53,833
[SEIKO] Clearly the enemy
has the inside track.

292
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,000
You led them here, didn't you?

293
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,500
That's not confirmed.

294
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,500
Even so, it's best
if we hold him down.

295
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,750
Done.

296
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,125
[YUKIZOME] Easy, Sakakura!
Don't be so rough!

297
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,250
Huh?

298
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,708
Stay calm.

299
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:13,500
Listen to me,
contact HQ for help.

300
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,250
No one leaves this room.

301
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,916
We'll wait for security.

302
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,208
They're all dead! The guards!
They've all been killed!

303
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,833
They're in the bathroom!

304
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,625
Comms are down too!
I can't reach the outside!

305
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,000
That is not a good sign.

306
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,375
[MITARAI]
Um, Chairman? Sir?

307
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:38,083
Sorry. I'm rather late.

308
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,875
[TENGAN]
Wait. Mitarai? You're here?

309
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,250
What's the situation?

310
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:49,416
It's the exits. Apparently
they've all been blown up.

311
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,958
So we're basically trapped...

312
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,166
Kyoko, what do we do?

313
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,541
[GOZU]
Nobody panic.

314
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,291
This room is full of Future
Foundation leadership,

315
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,541
the best of the best!

316
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,666
Whoever's behind this,
we can hand--

317
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,708
[clatter]

318
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,458
[JUZO]
What the--?

319
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:14,666
[SEIKO] S-Sleeping gas?
Dear god, it's so potent.

320
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,541
[MUNAKATA]
Yukizome?

321
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,833
Try to hold your breath!

322
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,208
[coughing]

323
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,416
Kyo... suke.

324
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,583
[gasps]

325
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,291
[NAEGI]
What is this?

326
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,750
[BANDAI] Ugh.
Divorce papers from an imp.

327
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:05,250
[NAEGI]
A timer? For what?

328
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,583
[MONOKUMA laughs]

329
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,666
[MONOKUMA]
Long time no see, kiddos!

330
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,041
[MONOKUMA laughs]

331
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,458
[ASAHINA]
That laugh!

332
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,208
[MONOKUMA] As long as Despair
keeps the home fires lit.

333
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,791
[MONOKUMA]
Whassup?

334
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:27,750
Your buddy Monokuma will
always come blazin' back!

335
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,833
[NAEGI]
How?

336
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,416
Junko Enoshima is dead!

337
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,500
[JUZO]
Who're you supposed to be?

338
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,708
[MONOKUMA]
Let's get to it. Ahem.

339
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,583
People of the Future Foundation,

340
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,416
I'm a big fan of how you're
trying to save the world.

341
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,208
No, really.
Bang up job, I mean it.

342
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,541
Thanks to you guys,
the Remnants of Despair

343
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,708
have been on a losing streak
of colossal proportions.

344
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:01,000
We're practically on the
verge of total annihilation!

345
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:04,125
But hey, I'm not one
to bear a grudge.

346
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,708
In fact, I'm here to thank you.

347
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,500
By having you all
kill each other!

348
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,500
[laughs]

349
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,625
[ALL gasp]

350
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,666
[laughing]

351
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,416
[MONOKUMA] No worries!
We'll treat it like a game!

352
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,500
You millennials are super into
that kinda stuff, aren'tcha?

353
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,083
Killing each other?

354
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,500
[laughs]

355
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,375
[MONOKUMA] Hey, what can I say?
History repeats itself.

356
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,875
"But Mister Monokuma, sir!

357
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,208
We don't wanna play
the killing people game."

358
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,291
Tough titty!
That's how it works!

359
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,333
We won't do it!

360
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,708
We're not gonna play

361
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,083
and there's not a damn thing
you can do to make us!

362
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,791
We're allies! We're not
gonna kill each other off!

363
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,083
No. Never again.

364
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,333
[MUNAKATA]
Where's Yukizome?

365
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,833
Did anyone see her?

366
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,875
[dripping]

367
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,416
[gasps]

368
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,083
[MONOKUMA]
Oh shoot, that's right.

369
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:07,125
[MONOKUMA]
I shoulda said earlier.

370
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:10,166
But, um, yeah...

371
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,000
The games already started!

372
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:28,000
[MUNAKATA]
Yukizome, tell me...

373
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,708
[MUNAKATA]
Please.

374
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,458
[MUNAKATA]
Am I...? Am I wrong?

375
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,250
[MONOKUMA laughing]

376
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,875
[MONOKUMA]
Look alive, Naegi!

377
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:49,208
'Cause ready or not, son, we're
about to start a killlin' game

378
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,666
that'll determine the
fate of all humanity!

379
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,041
The big daddy,
high-noon showdown

380
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,041
'tween Hope and Despair!

381
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,625
Think I'm exaggerating?

382
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,250
Shows what you know, buckaroo!

383
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:06,541
Gird your loins!
The final battle is nigh!

384
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,958
Every story has an end.

385
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,125
This'll be ours!
