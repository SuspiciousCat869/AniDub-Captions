[sighs]

2
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,500
[HAGAKURE] Alrighty then,
what's the plan now?

3
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:34,166
Duh! Of course.
I'm a fortune teller!

4
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,666
[chanting]

5
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,333
[HAGAKURE]
Ka!

6
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:43,375
[ALL laughing]

7
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,291
[HAGAKURE]
There it is!

8
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,666
Aw, yeah! We all live
happily ever after!

9
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,125
My predictions never fail!

10
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,333
[laughing]

11
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:55,916
I mean, sure, there's a
margin of error, but--

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm always 30% accurate! Heh!

13
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,083
What's the problem?
Saying goodbye that tough?

14
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:13,291
Heh. You're not the
least bit sad to go?

15
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,583
Graduating makes me feel lonely.

16
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,416
[JUZO]
That's a weird way to see it.

17
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,000
'S not like we're
breakin' up the band.

18
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,083
[MUNAKATA]
The future belongs to us.

19
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:25,291
With our skills, the world
is our virtual oyster.

20
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,125
[chuckles]

21
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,041
I'm already the World Champ.

22
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,708
But hangin' with you
guys is way more fun.

23
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,125
Yeah, Munakata.

24
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,083
While it's great you have
such a laser-honed vision

25
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,416
of the future,

26
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,083
someone still has to play
your devil's advocate.

27
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,666
I agree.

28
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,083
Hope's Peak needs an
overhaul in management.

29
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:48,125
Now, while its reputation
needs a bit of mending,

30
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,791
there is still a
great deal of respect

31
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,750
for the school's
core philosophy.

32
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,708
And that won't change.

33
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,291
I'll be establishing
an overseas campus.

34
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,708
When it inevitably succeeds,

35
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,666
I'll take the helm
of the whole school.

36
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,875
Sakakura, after
I've seized power,

37
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,041
you'll be in charge of Security.

38
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,750
Oh, hell yeah!

39
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:11,250
Compared to winnin' this baby
here, that'd be a cakewalk.

40
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,750
Yukizome, I have a role
for you to play as well:

41
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,208
Forging relations.

42
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,208
Okay.

43
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:22,458
This will be how we make a
real difference in the world.

44
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,166
Easy, pal, 's quite a dream.

45
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,208
A dream? No, reality.

46
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,708
With you two by my side,
I'm sure of it.

47
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:36,208
I have a vision.
Together, we have a plan.

48
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,958
Farewell... Chisa.

49
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,583
[gasps]

50
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,916
Oh, God. Oh, God!

51
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,916
Kirigiri.

52
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,958
Kirigiri, wake up!

53
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,083
There is no one
to blame but you.

54
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,000
Makoto Naegi.

55
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,458
What lines are you
willing to cross

56
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,166
to stand on the side of Hope?

57
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,833
How badly do you want to
see Despair vanquished?

58
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,708
Coward. Why did you turn?

59
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,416
That's not what happened.

60
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,541
I only-- I only wanted to help!

61
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,291
Hope cannot be built
on platitudes.

62
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,333
They're not just platitudes!

63
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,250
So terribly naïve.

64
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,750
Did you think this could be
resolved without bloodshed?

65
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,416
Without lives being lost?

66
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,250
Yes, I did! There's no
reason she had to--!

67
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,500
This is not game.

68
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,958
There are no rules for
you to set a course by.

69
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,333
Hollow words are only good
for rallying the rabble

70
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,958
to a lost cause!

71
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,375
That's the nature of reality.

72
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,041
[yells]

73
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:06,166
Naegi! You okay? What is it?

74
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,875
It was just a dream.

75
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,208
Well, that's a relief!

76
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,333
Oh, man! Must've been one
heck of a dream, though!

77
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,083
Scared me there for a sec.

78
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,083
[USAMI] Me, too! The way
you were thrashing around.

79
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,916
Is, uh... Is everybody safe?

80
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,333
[ASAHINA]
You bet'cha!

81
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:23,250
We got Super High School-Level
Good Luck on our side!

82
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,500
Um. Something wrong?

83
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,208
I'm glad the three
of us are okay.

84
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,791
But while we were all asleep,

85
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,958
the Attacker must've
gotten someone.

86
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,125
[USAMI, ASAHINA]
Uh?

87
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,541
Third time. Looks like
we're all still intact.

88

[KIZAKURA yawning]

89
00:07:58,791 --> 00:07:59,833
[KIZAKURA]
Hm?

90
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,666
Oh, hey. You're not
dead. Good on ya.

91
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,958
Uh. Guess not. Thanks.

Is-Is that, um--?

93
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,250
Gozu, yes. The Attacker's
second victim, poor devil.

94
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,208
What a way to go.

95
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,750
Well, what do we do now?

96
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,666
Drink to our continued survival?

97
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,125
Huh?

98
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,833
There's likely a third
victim waiting to be found.

99
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,250
I suggest we go look.

100
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,500
Oh, yeah. Sounds great.

101
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,916
[KIZAKURA]
So why're we doin' this?

102
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,750
To out the Attacker?

103
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,500
Mind you, I'm not
questioning your methods.

104
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:56,625
How many bodies you need
to figure it out, though?

105
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,875
You know what's funny?

106
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,000
I read once detectives
are why murderers exist.

107
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,791
Makes sense in a
warped kinda way.

108
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,333
Barring crimes of passion,
you gotta figure most are in it

109
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,541
to one-up some know-it-all.

110
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,291
Oo. Ha, ha. Eh...

111
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,958
What're you trying to say?

112
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,958
Don't listen to me. I'm kiddin'.

113
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:16,250
Look, a buddy of mine
hates detectives,

114
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,916
like seriously hates 'em.

115
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,666
Probably rubbed off on me.

116
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,958
You have a buddy?

117
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,125
Nobody special.

118
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,875
Not exactly germane
to the story, 'kay?

119
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,708
Humble advice from
a former teacher?

120
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,083
It'd do you good to break outta

121
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,166
that logical mindset
now and again.

122
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,583
I realize the world of human
emotion can get murky,

123
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,333
but still.

124
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,166
[KIRIGIRI exhales]

125
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,333
There you go.
Didn't that feel good?

126
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,291
Sure. Are you following me?

127
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,875
Uh. Do what?

128
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,208
So now I'm following you

129
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,416
if I happen to be walkin'
in the same direction?

130

[KIRIGIRI] Fine. Then I'll
go this way, thank you.

132

[KIRIGIRI] A single knife
wound to the chest.

133
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:22,083
I'm assuming the
Attacker did this.

134
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,333
[KIZAKURA]
Hey!

135
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,500
Well that doesn't look healthy.

W-We found the latest victim.

Huh. I wouldn't be so sure.

...come with me for
just a sec, please?

140

Whatever it is,
we don't have time.

141
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,708
[KIZAKURA sighs]

142
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,125
Uh, yeah.

143
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,916
The clock's not really
on anyone's side here.

144
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,833
This young lady also has a
single knife wound to the chest.

145
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:54,125
Seems to be the
Attacker's preferred MO.

146
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,750
[MITARAI]
U-Uh, I thought only one person

147
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,875
was supposed to be
killed at a time.

148
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,666
This doesn't make any sense!

149

We're all members of
the Future Foundation.

150

Damn shame.

00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,916
Well, blame the traitor.

152

Somebody clearly identifies
more with the Remnants.

153
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:17,833
So spill the beans. You got
yourself a favorite suspect yet?

Please, you gotta help me!

There.

158
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,208

Perfect! Well done!

Whoa!

163
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:47,916
[NAEGI]
Stop!

164
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,041
[NAEGI]
Chairman Tengan...

165
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,833
[NAEGI]
It-It can't be.

166
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,375
[USAMI]
This wasn't the Attacker.

167
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,458
Tengan's wounds indicate
the use of a katana.

168
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:10,041
Munakata must've finally killed
him. I'm so terribly sorry.

169
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,125
Naegi?

170
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:19,083
[NAEGI] I thought if we just
talked it out, we could...

171
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,416
...we could come to
an understanding,

172
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,625
without people dying.

173
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,416
[NAEGI]
I really did.

174
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,041
[giggles]

175
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:38,500
My goodness!
So delectably sweet!

176
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,500
Look at the poor babies.
D'aaww, punkin'.

177
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,500
We need a li'l cheering up, huh?

178
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,375
[NAEGI]
Everything I did...

179
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,000
...there was no point
to any of it.

180
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,458
Hey, c'mon.

181
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,208
[USAMI]
That's not true and you know it!

182
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,666
It's in your nickname
for cryin' out loud!

183
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,416
You of all people know how
infectious hope can be!

184
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,666
Watching you try your very best,

185
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,791
my whole outlook on the
situation has changed!

186
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,541
And as someone who's benefited
from your unflappable attitude,

187
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:12,208
now it's my turn to give back
a smidge of that same Hope!

188
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,583
I'll be the first one to admit

189
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,041
things aren't going
so well right now.

190
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,333
But so what? It'll get
better before the end.

191
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:21,875
I've never been so sure of
anything in my entire life!

192
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:26,250
Me, neither. Everything's
gonna turn out for the best.

193
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,166
[USAMI] Wait. Take a
closer look at the body.

194
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,416
[ASAHINA] "I entrust the Hope
of the world to you."

195
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,041
Whoa. He had to
mean Naegi, right?

196
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,166
That couldn't have
been addressed to me.

197
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,000
Why not?

198
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,750
It's a heavy burden, sure,

199
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,541
but you don't have
to carry it alone.

200
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,291
[USAMI]
I can help, too, you know!

201
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,958
That's what being soul
mates is all about!

202
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,916
You're absolutely right.

203
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,166
I just have to stop
thinking like a lone wolf.

204
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,708
When I fought Junko Enoshima,

205
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,791
it certainly wasn't
a one-man show.

206
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:14,666
Heh. I-I have to remember
I'm not in this alone.

207
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,708
Of course not.

208
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,666
We'll pull through together.
As a team.

209
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,333
Okie dokie.

210
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:24,000
Sounds like he wants the girls
to solve his problems for him.

211
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,958
Frickin' loser.

212
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,333
Ha!

213
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,083
If something that cheesy
an put him back on his feet,

214
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,750
his head must be,
like, totally empty.

215
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,791
To think a whiney li'l tool like
this got the drop on Junko!

216
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,791
Way to set an example, big sis!

217
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,833
[ASAHINA]
All right, thinking caps on.

218
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,375
How do we beat whoever
it is at their own game?

219
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,833
[USAMI] Ideally, we'd find
and put a stop to the Attacker

220
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,666
before he or she strikes again.

221
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,750
Precisely how, I'm not sure.

222
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:48,875
That's an easy one!

223
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,458
Punch their friggin'
lights out! Yeah!

224
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,750
Oh, right,
our Forbidden Actions.

225
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,750
I hate this game so much.

226
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,583
Wait. What did you just say?

227
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,791
[ASAHINA] Oh, um.
I said I hate this game.

228
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,916
I mean, the rules make it
impossible to win.

229
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,083
It's totally rigged.

230
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:12,541
[NAEGI]
The rules... of the game.

231
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,416
Yet for all that heroism,

232
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,166
you only won because it
was no more than a game.

233
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,458
Out here, things
aren't so cut and dry.

234
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,833
In the real world,
there are no rules.

235
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,375
Guys, that's it!

236
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,333
Why are we playing Monokuma's
game in the first place?

237
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,250
It's so simple! We just
need to shut it down!

238
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,708
What're you talking about?

239
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,208
Any of us are free to leave
whenever we feel like it!

240
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,125
Uh, yeah, but correct
me if I'm wrong;

241
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:39,291
I thought we confirmed
all the exits were sealed.

242
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,458
Who cares when we can
just make our own exit?!

243
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,875
We can do it. This isn't
like the last time.

244
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,750
The rules don't say anything
about busting our way out.

245
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,250
A-ha!

246
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,750
There's got to be something
we can use lying around.

247
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,708
All we have to do is
get through the walls!

248
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,916
[USAMI] Or perhaps we
could have someone else

249
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,541
break them down from outside.

250
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,541
[NAEGI]
From outside?

251
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,833
[USAMI]
Heave-ho!

252
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,458
We'll use the Monitoring Room!

253
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:05,916
I'll hack into the comm network

254
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,291
and get us in touch with our
Future Foundation comrades

255
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,333
on the mainland!

256
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,208
They'll have the
resources to help!

257
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,541
[NAEGI]
That's genius!

258
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,041
See what happens when you
think outside the box?

259
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,416
Yeah, we were so caught up
trying to abide by the rules,

260
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,208
it didn't occur to us
to look for loopholes.

261
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,916
Nice work, Miss Gekkogahara!

262
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,875
You're a warrior of Hope!

263
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,875
Thought the jig was up.
Whew. Man.

264
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,708
[USAMI]
Oh, yeah! Darn tootin' I am!

265
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,791
What are we waitin' for?
Let's call for help!

266
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,041
[USAMI]
One moment, please,

267
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,458
while I calculate the
most efficient route!

268
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,625
Right. Let's go!

269
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:48,000
[RURUKA crying]

270
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,333
[RURUKA]
I can't believe Yoi's dead.

271
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,750
You don't understand. What'll
I do on my own? I'm helpless!

272
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,125
I'm sorry.

273
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,250
[RURUKA crying]

274
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,166
Please, oh please, tell me
you're not the ones behind this!

275
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,500
Are you the Attacker?
Am I gonna die?

276
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,416
No! Of course not.

277
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,750
[RURUKA sighs]

278
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,583
I believe you. Look, can
I be a part of your group?

279
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,500
I really can't do anything
on my own. So, you know--

280
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,500
I, uh--

281
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,791
You heard the girl.

282
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,375
[MITARAI] It's not as though
we can just leave her here.

283
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,583
Then we don't have a choice.

284
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,750
Thank you.

285
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:24,916
Of course.

286
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,083
Can we maybe go to
a different room now?

287
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:31,208
I'm sorry. I can't bear to
see him like this anymore.

288
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,833
Don't apologize.
I-I wasn't thinking.

289
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,166
We're staying.

290
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,833
There are several things
I still need to ascertain

291
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,500
before moving on.

292
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,666
I intend to avenge
Izayoi's murder.

293
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,208
Will you help me?

294
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,416
[ASAHINA]
Cool. Are we good?

295
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,750
[USAMI] If I can hook up the
network cable, we're golden.

296
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,875
Now cross your fingers and
let's make some magic happen!

297
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,916
Come on, baby! Make momma proud!

298
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,250
Oh! Yeah!
We have connectivity!

299
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,541
Well that was easy.

300
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,958
[USAMI] Hailing frequencies
are open, Captain.

301
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,583
[NAEGI] Um, hello?
Can anyone hear me? This is--

302
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,458
[VOICE]
Read you loud and clear.

303
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,125
[NAEGI]
Byakuya?

304
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,083
Pleasure to hear from you.

305
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,666
Even if you do appear
a bit harried.

306
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,083
What's wrong?

307
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,708
Ah. Aren't you on trial
or some nonsense?

308
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,916
Things are complicated.

309
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,208
[TOGAMI]
Hm.

310
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,083
I'll need a bit more detail
than that, please.

311
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,833
So, a Mutual Killing game?

312
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,083
Wait, you-you didn't know?

313
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,375
But Monokuma told us
it was being televised,

314
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,750
just like last time.

315
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,750
I assure you, there has
been no such program.

316
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,208
It would be very intensive.

317
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,416
I don't believe the Remnants
have the wherewithal these days.

318
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,041
[gasps]

319
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:02,625
[TOGAMI]
No. Scratch that.

320
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,875
One of my little birds
reported back.

321
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,875
A Future Foundation
peacekeeping squad

322
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,291
is en route to a certain
island as we speak.

323
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,000
But, for some reason,
none of the other branches

324
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,208
have been informed.

325
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,583
Are they headed where
I think they are?

326
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:21,458
Indeed. Jabberwock Island.

327
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:27,166
[NAEGI] But... who would
possibly send them there?

328
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,583
The peacekeeping squad answers
directly to the Vice Chairman.

329
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:34,416
Ergo, we may reasonably deduce
whatever the meeting's outcome.

330
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Kyosuke Munakata means to treat
the inhabitants of said island

331
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,375
as Remnants of Despair.

332
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,708
So everyone here's in danger!

333
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,875
[TOGAMI] I think we may further
postulate a connection

334
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,083
between this operation and
what's happening to you.

335
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,208
As you might imagine,
I don't like this one bit.

336
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,250
I thought it best to deploy
my own forces.

337
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,708
They shall reach
you momentarily.

338
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,958
[NAEGI]
Thank you. Just... be careful.

339
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,166
[TOGAMI]
I'll let Fuwaka into the loop.

340
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,333
Kirigiri is there
with you, correct?

341
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:08,458
Yep! It's time for the 78th
graduating class to reunite!

342
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,750
[NAEGI]
Well, mostly.

343
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,625
There's someone
we're forgetting.

344
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,208
[TOGAMI] I would not
call this a good time.

345
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,166
Honestly, we're just
glad you're coming.

346
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,583
We can hold out.

347
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,833
[TOGAMI] I meant for Monokuma
and "his excellency,"

348
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,250
Vice Chairman Munakata.

349
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,875
You're quick on your
feet, tenacious,

350
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,333
and singularly fortunate.

351
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,875
I'd sooner cavort with sharks

352
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,750
than risk making
an enemy of you.

353
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,916
Good luck.

354
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,916
[USAMI] Your party has
been disconnected.

355
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,250
[ASAHINA]
Hm.

356
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,125
He was so reassuring.
That was nice of him, huh?

357
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,916
Yeah, must be turning
over a new leaf.

358
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,125
The guy still has a way
with words, though!

359
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,833
[ASAHINA, NAEGI laugh]

360
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,416
You heard the man.

361
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,125
The Foundation is in danger.

362
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,083
Round up all present and
fully vetted members!

363
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,416
[AGENTS]
Sir!

364
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,833
[AGENT A] Excuse me,
but why didn't you tell him?

365
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,458
[TOGAMI] What?
About Miaya Gekkogahara?

366
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:08,375
Yes, sir. Naegi told
you she was with them.

367
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:13,666
That she in fact facilitated
the emergency call.

368
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,750
And yet, according to our intel,
Gekkogahara is dead.

369
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,958
[TOGAMI]
I am familiar with the report.

370
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,083
Clearly we're dealing
with an imposter.

371
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,583
Troubling, yes.

372
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,458
But we dare not expose her
while she's so close to them.

373
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,375
Who knows what she might do.

374
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,625
For now, the best course
of action is to let her be

375
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,375
and focus on the mastermind.

376
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,791
You don't think they're
one and the same, sir?

377
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,916
Given the Remnants' weakened
state, that may very well be.

378
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,500
Only one person has the
resources to orchestrate this.

379
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,458
Monaka Towa, who's
currently below the radar

380
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,416
somewhere in Towa City.

381
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,333
I'll wager she's our maestro.

382
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:56,500
Fortunately, we already
have people there.

383
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,708
No! Stop! Leave me alone!

384
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:04,625
Don't come any closer.
No! Please!

385
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,416
Now, now, Touko.

386
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,041
Everyone has to bathe.
You don't wanna stink!

387
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:12,125
[FUKAWA] Wh-What if I do?
Maybe I like how I smell.

388
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,458
[FUKAWA sniffing]

389
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,625
[KOMARU]
Gotcha!

390
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,708
--[KOMARU laughing]
--[FUKAWA squealing]

391
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,791
[KOMARU]
Hey! Quit squirming!

392
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:22,416
Oh! It's Master Byakuya!
Coming, sire!

393
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:26,666
Oh well. So much for
that idea, I guess.

394
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,583
[NAEGI]
We're all in this together.

395
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,916
And that's how we can survive.

396
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,625
With my friend by my side,

397
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,625
however bad things get,

398
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:41,541
we'll move forward
one step at a time.

399
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:51,291
[NAEGI] I may not know
what's waiting for us,

400
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:52,375
but...

401
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,916
[FUKAWA chuckling]

402
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,333
[NAEGI]
...we'll keep going.

403
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,833
Come what may.

404
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,625
[NAEGI]
That's what hope does.

405
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,375
It charges ahead.

406
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,166
[HINATA]
Boring.
