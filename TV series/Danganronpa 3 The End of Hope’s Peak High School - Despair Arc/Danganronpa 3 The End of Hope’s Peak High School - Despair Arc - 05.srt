Wow!

Are you like a genius

Huh?

And what should I call you?

Huh? Finally.

I got snacks with

eat sweets at all?

Mh-hm.

00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,291
Sorry. Sugar's bad for me.

00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:52,125
It causes the medicine I'm on
to have real awful side effects.

That sucks. I love sweets.

to share them with friends.

were friends.

less out of it than I put in.

More of an art project.

Hurts like a bitch, huh?

where you die, Seiko.

Then you tucked your tail
between your legs.

55
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,875
What happened?

56
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:13,875
Is that an actual question or
are you simply being rhetorical?

57

I took a good, hard
look at the impasse

Listen to me.

You've somehow got
it into your head

65
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,333
that annihilating the
Remnants is the same

66
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:35,291
as annihilating Despair.

the end of it, yes?

So about this stuff.

that wholesale slaughter
will give rise to Hope,

00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,458
[SOHNOSUKE] Should I swallow
my pride as a blacksmith?

161
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,041
Uh! Damn it!

162
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,041
Bet they have no idea
I'm runnin' around out here

163
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,750
like a chicken with
its head cut off!

164
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,625
What is goin' on in there?

165
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:13,666
Wh--? What the hell?

166
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,083
[RURUKA] How did I
figure it out, you ask?

167
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,541
Elementary, my dear Watson!

168
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,583
I simply observed your
reaction to the lights.

169
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,916
When you saw them switch on,
your panic was unmistakable.

170
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,375
Oh, and I couldn't
help but notice

171
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,458
you kept avoiding
Yoi like poison.

172
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,083
Plus, why else would you
still be here listening to me?

173
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,375
It all fits. Sorry.

174
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,708
[RURUKA]
You know, I could let you go.

175
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,958
In fact, if you do
exactly as I say,

176
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,916
I might be willing
to bury the hatchet.

177
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,833
Just a nibble.

178
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,458
Yeah, no more polite refusals.

179
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,500
No more "Oh, but I can't."
Eat and you get to live.

180
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,416
[growls]

181
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,500
[SEIKO]
If I eat it, I'll die.

182
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,666
I've told you before.
Countless times.

183
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,125
[RURUKA]
Ugh. I swear.

184
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,416
Fine, whatever.

185
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,875
I'll just have to come up
with something else.

186
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,541
Hmm...

187
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,041
Got it!

188
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,500
Let's talk about Vice
Chairman Munakata.

189
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,125
[gasps]

190
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,583
Swear on your life
you'll kill him

191
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:26,333
and you're off the hook
with me and Sohnosuke.

192
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,958
Deal?

193
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,666
But... I-- You can't.

194
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,000
[RURUKA]
Look, we have nothing to do

195
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,625
with the Remnants
of Despair, okay?

196
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,208
I promise.

197
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,625
We're just of the opinion that
removing him from the equation

198
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,625
is the best way to
resolve this mess.

199
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,916
Self righteous bastard's
running the Foundation

200
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,708
into the ground.

201
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,375
He's gotta be dealt with.

202
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:48,083
I can't do it. I refuse! He--

203
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,500
[SEIKO]
He took me in.

204
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,833
Hope's Peak had thrown me out.
I was as good as dead.

205
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,833
And there he was, like a
guardian angel,

206
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:58,833
offering me a future just when
I thought my story was over.

207
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:12,166
[screaming]

208
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,750
No! Stay back!

209
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:35,333
[RURUKA]
Seiko. You used to be my hero.

210
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,791
It seemed like there was
nothing you couldn't do.

211
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,000
Whenever I needed something...

212
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,833
...all I had to do was ask.

213
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,166
I trusted you.

214
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,750
[SEIKO] I wanted--
I needed a friend. That's it.

215
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,750
Be my friend and I'd follow
you to Hell and back.

216
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,833
I gave you everything,
without question.

217
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,000
[RURUKA] I hate that it's
come to this. I really do.

218
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,958
[SEIKO]
Why did this have to happen?

219
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,125
Where did I go wrong?

220
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:06,833
[RURUKA] I asked for your help
because I believed in you.

221
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,750
[SEIKO]
I gave you whatever you wanted

222
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,541
because I wanted you to like me.

223
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:15,333
[RURUKA] I relied on you so much
because I looked up to you.

224
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,833
I wanted to be you.

225
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,916
[SEIKO]
You looked down your nose at me.

226
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,041
You always did.
I was a tool to you.

227
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,750
[SEIKO yells]

228
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,208
[SEIKO, RURUKA]
What happened?

229
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,625
Why did things
turn out this way?

230
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:30,666
[gasps]

231
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,458
[SEIKO chuckles]

232
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,666
[SEIKO yells]

233
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,208
[tires screching]

234
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,791
[USAMI]
We're back, ladies and germs!

235
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:14,083
Eh, maybe I should.
Just a little.

236
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:18,875
Okie dokie! Let's go! Round Two!

237
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,666
[USAMI] Fair warning, folks,
this is gonna be big!

238
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,083
You probably oughta duck!

239
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:24,708
What?

240
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,333
We gotta get down!

241
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,291
[USAMI]
Fire in the hole!

242
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,958
[USAMI] Boom! Now you
probably oughta run!

243
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,083
I mean, a girl's gotta
keep herself entertained

244
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,666
somehow, right?

245
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,958
Naegi, hop on!

246
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,000
Uh, yeah. Good call.

247
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,208
Wait! Son of a--!

248
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,208
You gotta be
kiddin' me with this.

249
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,791
I'm startin' to severely hate
this guy's lucky streak.

250
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,500
Can't last forever.

251
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,291
Have you learned
anything useful?

252
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,208
Yes. Quite a bit.

253
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,125
Ahh. Well, good for you.

254
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,916
So do we have a plan yet?

255
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,791
I need to locate and
examine Gozu's body.

256
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:13,208
It'll tell me what I need to
know about the Attacker's MO.

257
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,791
Okay.

258
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,666
They said you were cold,
but holy crap.

259
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,750
[MUNAKATA]
Point one:

260
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,958
This base's existence
is virtually unknown.

261
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,041
And point two:

262
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,625
Among those in the loop,

263
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,750
very few possess the means of
cutting us off from the outside.

264
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:37,458
It makes sense if you
look past the why.

265
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:40,000
How is it a man of your
stature comes to align himself

266
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,500
to the Remnants
in the first place?

267
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:46,416
If that's a question,
guess I have to answer.

268
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,083
I'm not on their side.

269
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,083
Though of course, I realize
what it must look like.

270
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,416
A logical conclusion
on your part,

271
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,791
albeit rather simplistic
for a mind so sharp.

272
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,166
This is not the time or place

273
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,625
for a mental sparring
match, Chairman.

274
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,625
Which of them is
the actual Attacker?

275
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,583
[TENGAN]
As I've said, if you're asking,

276
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,958
I have no choice but
to answer honestly.

277
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:13,583
[inaudible]

278
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:29,541
[MUNAKATA]
Is that--? Is that true?

279
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,375
I'm afraid so.

280
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,583
[MUNAKATA]
Hmph.

281
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:50,208
[MUNAKATA chuckles]

282
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,250
[MUNAKATA]
So be it then.

283
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,875
Hardly matters now.

284
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,625
I am beyond second
guessing myself.

285
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,416
Munakata, wait!

286
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:06,083
[MUNAKATA screaming]

287
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,375
You know absolutely
nothing, old man.

288
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:23,625
You don't know me, and you don't
know what I have in store.

289
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,166
Perhaps not.

290
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:31,875
But you, my friend, know nothing
about the nature of Hope.

291
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,208
[SEIKO]
Look at me.

292
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:04,458
What did I do?
How did I screw this up?

293
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:08,958
I'm useless... Useless.

294
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,000
Why the hell couldn't
I do something?

295
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:15,708
Why couldn't I save them?

296
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,125
I wanted to help.

297
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:21,791
That's the reason
behind everything I do.

298
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:35,375
[SEIKO] I just tried to be
a friend. Was that so bad?

Cool! Then that's what
I'm gonna call you!
