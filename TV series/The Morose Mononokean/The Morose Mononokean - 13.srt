1
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,083
[OKINA]
Dear, oh, dear.

2
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:11,125
Dreadfully sorry
for all the trouble.

3
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:11,958
[ABENO]
Not at all.

4
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,416
[YAHIKO]
Haruitsuki!

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,625
[ABENO]
Yeah?

6
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:16,625
My head is still hurting
from Ashiya's shoe.

7
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,416
Why'd he have to throw it at me?

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,666
[ABENO]
Let it go.

9
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,791
He didn't mean to;
he just couldn't see you.

10
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,125
[OKINA]
What?

11
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:28,750
That's odd. His second
sight isn't back yet?

12
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:32,958
Tomori assured him it would
return in a matter of days.

13
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:37,041
It isn't in her nature to have
misled the young man.

14
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,083
I'm certain she told the truth.

15
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,958
Don't concern yourself too much.
Things are bound to work out.

16
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,458
[YAHIKO]
Haruitsuki knows.

17
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:46,458
He went all the way to the
Underworld to ask her in person.

18
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,833
[ABENO] Shut up. I just
happened to be there, okay?

19
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:53,541
[OKINA]
May I ask what Tomori said?

20
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,750
Just what I already suspected.

21
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:59,708
The timeframe varies somewhat
from person to person.

22
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:00,916
If it takes a while, though,

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,416
there might be another
underlying cause.

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,625
[OKINA]
Hm.

25
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,708
[ABENO]
She's a little worried for him.

26
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:10,958
If Ashiya goes much longer
not being able to see <i>yokai</i> ,

27
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,250
he may never get his
second sight back.

28
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:16,500
[OKINA] Any notion of what the
"underlying cause" could be?

29
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,875
[ABENO] Kind of. More of an
educated guess, really.

30
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,833
[OKINA]
Ah. I thought as much.

31
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,333
Certainly explains how
lively things have been

32
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:27,125
around the shrine, huh?

33
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,375
[ABENO] If you'll excuse me,
Okina. I should go.

34
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,666
[OKINA]
Yes, of course. And don't worry.

35
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,708
As you say, it's
bound to work out.

36
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:37,583
I hope so. I'm not sure
what I'll do otherwise.

37
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,250
Yahiko. Ready?

38
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,291
Sure. This should be fun.

39
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,333
Wouldn't hurt if you gave
me a few extra treats

40
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:44,875
for agreeing to help tomorrow.

41
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:46,875
Fine. What do you
have a taste for?

42
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,291
[YAHIKO]
<i>Rakugan</i> and dumplings.

43
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,666
Oh, and steamed buns,
and, um, potato chips.

44
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,291
Oh! And you know what
else would be yummy?

45
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,291
[TEACHER A] For this example, we
can use the following formula.

46
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,666
First let's solve for "x."

47
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,166
[ASHIYA]
He's out again.

48
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,166
[TEACHER A]
Ashiya?

49
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,625
[ASHIYA]
Should I be worried?

50
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:32,875
[TEACHER A]
Ashiya!

51
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,291
Yes, sir?

52
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,333
[TEACHER A] I'd appreciate
it if you paid attention.

53
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,250
Sorry. I just spaced out.

54
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,291
[TEACHER A] Do you need to
go to the nurse's office?

55
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,916
Uh. No, sir!
I'm perfectly fine.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,250
[CLASSMATE A] Uh-oh! The kid
from the nurse's office is back!

57
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,791
[CLASSMATES laughing]

58
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,708
[TEACHER A] All right, people.
That's enough. Settle down.

59
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,375
[FUSSHI]
Our club's out today

60
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,291
so we're stopping by
the convenience store.

61
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,875
You got anything going on?

62
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:57,750
I can come.

63
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,333
I'm gettin' myself a croquette.

64
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,416
Now that you mention it,

65
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,041
I think I'm gonna grab
myself one too.

66
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,250
Hey there, Zenko,
how's it goin'?

67
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,625
Hanae.

68
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,583
Can you talk for a second?

69
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,000
[ASHIYA]
Sorry. You guys go on ahead.

70
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,708
Sure.

71
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:16,708
[ASHIYA]
Yahiko?

72
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,291
[ZENKO]
Yeah, he just took off.

73
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,750
He said Abeno needed his
help on a job yesterday

74
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,666
and I haven't seen or
heard from him since.

75
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,833
[ASHIYA] Is he trying to
be the new assistant?

76
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,166
[ZENKO]
Dunno.

77
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,208
But to be honest, it isn't
all that unusual for him

78
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,583
to disappear for a couple
of days now and then.

79
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,416
[ASHIYA]
I hope Fuzzy's okay.

80
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,791
It's just, he and Yahiko
aren't exactly best pals.

81
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,833
Fuzzy's scared of him.

82
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:42,041
Anyway, no point fretting about
it, right? Not much I can do.

83
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,791
[ASHIYA chuckles]

84
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,125
What is it?

85
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,833
[ZENKO] Nothing. You still
can't see 'em, can you?

86
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,416
It's been so long I'm
wondering if I ever will.

87
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,541
I hate to say it, but maybe
it's time to give up.

88
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,416
[ZENKO]
Oh, that's right!

89
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,291
Before he left, Yahiko said
something about he and Abeno

90
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,416
going to a mountain shrine.

91
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,000
He did, huh?

92
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,583
[ASHIYA]
What for?

93
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,625
[ASHIYA] Get a grip. No use
dwelling on what you can't do.

94
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,125
Move on. Forget about it.

95
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,000
[ANTS chattering]

96
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,333
[ASHIYA]
Huh?

97
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:27,291
Nice try. Why'd I come here?
Way to take my own advice.

98
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,750
[sighs]

99
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,583
[BIG BOSS SCREE]
Ki, ki, ki.

100
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:40,208
[ASHIYA] I can tell myself
to forget all I want.

101
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,708
[ASHIYA] It's not like
turning off a light.

102
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,291
[ASHIYA]
I need time.

103
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:52,541
[sighs]

104
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,916
Snap out of it and
focus already.

105
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,833
[ASHIYA] I wonder... are
Jomatsu and the princess okay?

106
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,291
[rustling]

107
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,000
[sighs]

108
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,875
Just my imagination.

109
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,291
[ASHIYA] Kinda hard to
shake the routine, I guess.

110
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,166
I'm still hyper-alert.

111
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,791
[ASHIYA]
Okay! Time to hit the books!

112
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,166
[ASHIYA] What could it be?
The job they're on.

113
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,458
Must be a big one
if Yahiko's along.

114
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,375
[ASHIYA] Ugh. What the
heck is wrong with me?

115
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,625
The more I try to push it out
of my mind, the more I worry!

116
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:45,750
Uh, am I crazy, or did
something just brush by?

117
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:51,291
[laughs]

118
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,541
What is my problem?

119
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,416
Why would I laugh out
loud for no reason?

120
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,166
It was almost like...

121
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,791
Please tell me I've only
lost my second sight

122
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,833
and not my mind!

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,375
[ASHIYA] This is it.
What did I expect to find?

124
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:12,666
This is stupid. Coming here
wasn't gonna change anything.

125
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,875
[ASHIYA]
Abeno? Yahiko?

126
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,958
I wouldn't know if he
was here, would I?

127
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:22,166
Hey, Abeno! Hello?

128
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,791
Come on, Ashiya,
get it together.

129
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,625
You know they're okay.
You're overthinking this.

130
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,250
Why would they be in danger?

131
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,291
I mean, after all:
Abeno is a pro.

132
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:36,250
I'll have a look around
just in case, but that's it.

133
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,791
[rustling]

134
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:41,833
[ASHIYA]
Hm?

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,625
Whoa there! Is that a <i>yokai</i> ?

136
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,583
Is my sight back? Have I
returned to normal or what?

137
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,708
Am I ready to go back to work?

138
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,958
[ASHIYA]
This leaf, is it...?

139
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:00,208
Is that you, Okina?

140
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,833
Hang on a minute!
Did Abeno come by here?

141
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,250
He probably had a fox with him.

142
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,208
Are they inside?

143
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:14,791
Excuse me. Is anybody in there?

144
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:18,791
Doesn't look like it.
Okina, where'd you go?

145
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:22,708
[ASHIYA]
That's...

146
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,125
I knew it looked familiar.

147
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:30,250
I'd recognize the
Mononokean's crest anywhere.

148
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,291
[gasps]

149
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,250
Got some dirt in my eye.

150
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,458
Uh, okay.

151
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:58,375
Hey, Okina. Is that you?

152
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:01,250
Huh? Wait, seriously?

153
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,583
All right, then.

154
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,458
But you, uh, you are
a <i>yokai</i> , right?

155
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,208
Terribly sorry: I can't
see you at the moment.

156
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:11,458
Bear with me, please. I don't
know what you look like, so...

00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,416
Calm down.
Nothing to be scared of.

158
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,541
He's a <i>yokai</i> . You've got this.

159
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,583
So, d'you, uh,
d'you invite me here

160
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:18,791
for something in particular?

161
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,625
I'm guessing you must
need an exorcism.

162
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:27,000
Oh, I, uh... I'm sorry?
I thought you...

163
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:27,833
Then why...?

164
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:28,458
[rustling]

165
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,166
[gasps]

166
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,375
[yelps]

167
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,791
[scuttling]

168
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,250
[squelching]

169
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,375
[clattering]

170
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,833
I'm surrounded. Welp.

171
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,708
Now I'm scared. What do I do?

172
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,208
[ASHIYA]
Ugh. I hate this.

173
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:54,000
It feels like... I dunno... like
I'm in a real-live horror movie.

174
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,916
Working for the Mononokean
desensitized me.

175
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,875
After a while, I let my
guard down around <i>yokai</i> .

176
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,375
Now that I can't see them?

177
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,416
Makes perfect sense Abeno
wouldn't want me around.

178
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,541
He had to draw
the line somewhere.

179
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,833
This freaked out,
I'm a liability.

180
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:12,875
Still, though, he could've been
nicer about it. I'm on his side.

181
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,166
I just... I just lashed out
at being called dead weight.

182
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,833
Look at me. What am I doing?

183
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:24,750
I'm petrified.

184
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,125
What if this thing's
not even a <i>yokai</i> ?

185
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,625
There's no way to tell.

186
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,333
Stop it. You're only
making this worse.

187
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,666
Pull yourself together.
I mean it!

188
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,291
You're useless enough
without being scared!

189
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,791
[ASHIYA]
I can't see them.

190
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:46,625
I can't hear them,
but they're definitely here.

191
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,458
What the--? What was that?

192
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:54,916
[ASHIYA] I think I can actually
feel them, staring at me.

193
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,458
That's weird. It's
not hostile, though.

194
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,625
Except, how can I be sure?

195
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:04,666
If I can't see them how can
I read their intentions?

196
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,333
I don't know. I swear
I feel kindness.

197
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,208
As if they're all... smiling.

198
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:13,125
[thud]

199
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,375
[gasps]

200
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:26,000
[ASHIYA screams]

201
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,166
[YAHIKO]
Come on, don't throw it away!

202
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,833
[ABENO]
Where'd you get a skull?

203
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,333
[YAHIKO] I found it in the
mountains! Neat, huh?

204
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,125
[ABENO]
Get rid of it.

205
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,666
[YAHIKO]
Aww!

206
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,083
Look at that. How long
you s'pose he'll be out?

207
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,833
Ki. Who'd have thought
the boy would faint?

208
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:44,041
[NOBOU] Perhaps we should splash
some cold water on his face?

209
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,666
Huh, I'm not sure what
we should do honestly.

210
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,916
Princess Anmo?

211
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,541
Again?!

212
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,208
[MITSUCHIGURA]
I say wake him.

213
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,833
Would you care to do
the honors for us?

214
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,000
[ASHIYA]
Fuzzy.

215
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,583
[ABENO]
Will you get up?

216
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:13,666
[ASHIYA gasps]

217
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,916
It's Big Boss Scree!
And Mitsuchigura and Manjirou!

218
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,750
And Spiny! And Nobu!
And Princess Anmo!

219
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,333
I don't believe it!

220
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, hey, Abeno. How're you?

221
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,333
[BIG BOSS SCREE]
Ki, ki, ki.

222
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,708
He gathered us here to help

223
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,416
restore your ability
to see <i>yokai</i> .

224
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,958
He gathered you?

225
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,291
[NOBOU] But of course! That's
what friends do, is it not?

226
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,875
He summoned us
and we came running

227
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,666
without a second thought.

228
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,916
[ASHIYA]
You... helped me?

229
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Don't get the wrong
idea, hot shot.

230
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,375
I was already in
the neighborhood

231
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,250
and thought I'd come
along for the ride.

232
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,666
Uh, I had a gift to drop
off at the Mononokean.

233
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,041
[laughs]

234
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,791
[MITSUCHIGURA]
You seem a lot better now!

235
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,541
[laughing]

236
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,416
Fuzzy! I thought I'd
never see you again!

237
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,958
I missed you so much,
and here you are!

238
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,333
Took you long enough
to acknowledge him.

239
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,666
[YAHIKO]
Wow! That was fun!

240
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,166
[OKINA chuckles]

241
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,833
You were just about to start
bawling like a little baby!

242
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,083
Huh?

243
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,708
Wait, so you were the
one holding the skull?

244
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,500
It's not cool to scare people!

245
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,166
Me scaring you is what brought
you back to normal, jerk!

246
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,041
Oh, and you're welcome,
by the way!

247
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,541
[ASHIYA]
What?

248
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,458
[ABENO] I might've told him
to lay it on a little thick.

249
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,791
Um, alrighty, then.

250
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,125
Not to be rude, but what
in the world is going on?

251
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,458
Gimme a break.

252
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,083
You've got your sight back,
what does it matter?

253
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:36,583
Don't get me wrong, I'm
ecstatic, it's just, y'know...

254
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,708
I'm just curious what
everyone's doing here.

255
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,583
What's different?
Why can I see them now?

256
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,083
Explain it to me! Please!

257
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,333
Shut up. You're so annoying!

258
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,458
[ABENO sighs]

259
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,333
It's not rocket science, okay?

260
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,875
Think back to what triggered
your ability in the first place.

261
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,625
[ASHIYA]
Okay.

262
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,041
The first <i>yokai</i> I saw was Fuzzy.

263
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,916
He was just lying
on the sidewalk.

264
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,458
[ABENO] Okay, and what was
going through your head?

265
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,333
[ASHIYA]
I don't remember.

266
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:06,000
No, wait, I was thinking about
what high school would be like.

267
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,625
Yeah, I figured it had to
be something lame as hell.

268
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,750
[ASHIYA]
Hey! It wasn't lame!

269
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,375
Look, thing is:
The catalyst wasn't you, okay?

270
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,291
It was you encountering Fuzzy.

271
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,333
Fuzzy granted me second sight?

272
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,666
Not quite, no.

273
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,666
The way you reacted to him
awoke a predisposition.

274
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,291
Essentially you
two "resonated."

275
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,666
You mean, like empathy?

276
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,166
I knew I had to do something
that would take you back,

277
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,291
put you in a receptive
state of mind.

278
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,625
Didn't take much.

279
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,458
[ABENO] Besides, I had help.

280
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,625
These <i>yokai</i> all have a special
place for you in their hearts.

281
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,666
[MITSUCHIGURA] Each and every
one of us stood by your side

282
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,250
throughout this whole ordeal,

283
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,541
praying for your
vision to return.

284
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,125
Wait, so, everything
these past few days...?

285
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,791
Happened for a reason.

286
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,666
Even without second sight,
you could tell they were there.

287
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,500
Your weird devotion to them
meant you only needed a jolt.

288
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,458
You don't have to
say it like that.

289
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,541
If I'm weird, what're you?

290
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,166
[ABENO]
Sorry for all the trouble.

291
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,083
Thank you very much.

292
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:08,041
[ABENO] What're you
waiting for? Say thanks.

293
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,458
They came all the way from
the Underworld for you.

294
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,041
Show some gratitude.

295
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,458
Aw, you guys!
I really owe you one!

296
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,791
[BIG BOSS SCREE]
Ki, ki, ki. Our pleasure.

297
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,250
[MANJIRO]
Yeah, whatever.

298
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,750
See you around, kid.

299
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,000
[ASHIYA]
Definitely.

300
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,083
Come pay us a visit in
the Underworld someday.

301
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,666
[ASHIYA]
Of course!

302
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,166
[NOBOU] The bonds of friendship
we've forged here are eternal.

303
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,083
[ASHIYA]
Yeah, they are. You're right.

304
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,875
Thank you. Thank you all.

305
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:33,875
[MITSUCHIGURA]
Of course.

306
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,125
Though when all
is said and done,

307
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,708
we're not the ones you
ought to be thanking.

308
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,916
Abeno, my friend,
if you would be so kind...

309
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,166
[ABENO]
Sure.

310
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,458
[ASHIYA chuckles]

311
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:58,791
[ASHIYA] Well, that's it.
We've sent them on their way.

312
00:15:58,875 --> 00:15:59,583
[ASHIYA gasps]

313
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,833
Wait a minute, I-- Abeno!

314
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,166
[ABENO]
Hm?

315
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh no. I'm pretty sure
my vision went up a level!

316
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,458
I can't just see <i>yokai</i> .
I can see ghosts!

317
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,041
[ABENO]
What?

318
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,833
[ASHIYA] I saw a hand reach out
and grab me through the wall!

319
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,833
It nearly ripped my sweater!

320
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,750
[ABENO]
Oh. That.

321
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,791
[ABENO]
Another gig? What the--?

322
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,291
[ASHIYA screams]

323
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,458
[ABENO]
Huh? Ashiya?

324
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,791
[ABENO] So, yeah, your vision
wasn't totally back yet.

325
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,791
The hand you saw was mine.

326
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,958
Ugh! Well it scared
the crap out of me!

327
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,416
[OKINA] I took it upon myself
to call on Abeno here

328
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,208
because you appeared
to be looking for him.

329
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,208
Forgive me for startling you.

330
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,958
On that subject, why did you
come here? Nobody asked you to.

331
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,250
Well, you just, um,

332
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,541
you weren't in class
and I thought maybe...

333
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,375
Look, I was worried, all right?

334
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,541
I know what you're gonna say.

335
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,500
"Use your head. What
good could you've done me?"

336
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,833
[OKINA]
All the same,

337
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,625
we're pleased your ability
to see us has returned.

338
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,416
Don't you agree, Abeno?

339
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,625
Yes.

340
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,041
[YAHIKO] Would've been
awful if it hadn't!

341
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,791
Especially after going
to all the trouble

342
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,458
of getting everyone from
the Underworld to--

343
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:13,250
[ABENO] Shut up.
Throw away that damn skull.

344
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,458
[YAHIKO]
Haruitsuki, what was that for?

345
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,750
[ABENO]
Just do as I say.

346
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,708
[YAHIKO]
But I wanna show it to Zenko!

347
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,708
[ABENO] You don't just bring
a skull into a temple.

348
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,958
[YAHIKO] Why not?
I'll put it back afterwards!

349
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,500
[ASHIYA]
What?

350
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,833
[YAHIKO]
Haruitsuki.

351
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,500
You arranged this whole thing!
It was your idea!

352
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,458
You even went to the Underworld
just to bring them all here!

353
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,958
And you wanted me
to think I was fired!

354
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,166
Thanks a lot, Okina.

355
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,750
[OKINA chuckles]

356
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,291
I'm really sorry.

357
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,750
If I'd had any idea I wouldn't
have thrown my shoe at you.

358
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,208
Hope it didn't
clock ya too hard.

359
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,000
[YAHIKO]
I'm the one you hit!

360
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,333
[ASHIYA]
Seriously?

361
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,416
Uh-huh. Stupid thing got
me right on the forehead.

362
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,000
[ASHIYA]
You were on the roof? My bad!

363
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,166
The price of forgiveness
is ten dumplings.

364
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,708
[ASHIYA]
Um, glazed or red bean?

365
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,000
Better do both kinds.

366
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,625
[ABENO]
I'll take care of it.

367
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,166
It really oughta be me.

368
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,958
I'll go to the convenience
store tomorrow.

369
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,250
[ABENO]
Ashiya.

370
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,416
[ASHIYA]
Yeah?

371
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,833
[ABENO] Sorry for being so rude
to you through all this.

372
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:08,958
Forgive me.

373
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,125
If you would like to,

374
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,458
I'd be happy to have
you back on the job.

375
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,500
Are you willing to come
work for me again?

376
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,333
I could use the help.

377
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,833
[ASHIYA]
Huh?!

378
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,541
Why are you bowing?!
It's awkward!

379
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,500
What? It's customary,
you idiot. So?

380
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,291
[ASHIYA]
Huh? Oh.

381
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,583
Yes!

382
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:29,833
Absolutely.

383
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,375
Uh, I mean, I promise
to do my absolute best!

384
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,208
You won't be disappointed!

385
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,666
[ABENO]
Now it's awkward.

386
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,375
[ASHIYA laughing]

387
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,333
Don't do that,
Fuzzy. It tickles!

388
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,375
[ABENO]
Your absolute best, huh?

389
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,833
[ASHIYA]
Stop!

390
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,125
[ABENO]
What a terrifying prospect.

391
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,833
[ASHIYA] Huh? Really?
Fuzzy never left my side?

392
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,083
[ABENO]
Come rain or shine.

393
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,625
I let him be, to avoid
the separation anxiety.

394
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,750
[ASHIYA] I'm sorry
I didn't see you, buddy.

395
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,625
It must've been lonely.

396
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,625
What'cha tryin' to say?

397
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,041
[ABENO] Don't use speech
bubbles to be cute.

398
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,500
[ASHIYA "I guess I'll
play ball with you."

399
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,208
[ASHIYA]
Not a problem, li'l guy!

400
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,166
Thanks for translating.
Didn't know you could do that.

401
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,375
[ASHIYA]
C'mon, let's go!

402
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,000
[ABENO]
Guessing?

403
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,583
You're both <i>yokai</i> .
It wasn't a shot in the dark.

404
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,916
[ASHIYA]
All right, you ready?

405
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,875
Heads up!

406
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,250
Nice catch!

407
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,083
[ABENO]
You know,

408
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,791
I used to not be tall
enough to ring this bell.

409
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,458
I was determined to
make it ring, though.

410
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:53,916
I had Aoi lift me up
so I could reach.

411
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,625
Must make you uneasy
the master's human now.

412
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,958
Especially since my
assistant is, too, right?

413
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:02,666
[gasps]

414
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,166
[ABENO] It's hard for people
and <i>yokai</i> to coexist.

415
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,333
Lot of variables have to
be in perfect balance.

416
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:15,083
Humans have their strengths,
but we're still mortal.

417
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,791
Before you know it,
we're out of the picture.

418
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,791
[ABENO]
He'll realize that eventually.

419
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,375
[ABENO] What's your take?
Is he worth it?

420
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,166
<i>Yokai</i> employees have
a longer shelf life.

421
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,208
If you want me to
reconsider, I will.

422
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,625
Diplomatic.

423
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:05,041
[ABENO]
Me, too. I guess.

424
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,041
We're out of the
woods for now, sure.

425
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:11,125
But I'm thinking about all
the <i>yokai</i> willing to help us.

426
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,500
And the fact it only
took one to fix him.

427
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,875
Seems a little worrisome,
is all. Think about it.

428
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:22,000
How attached does the hairball
have to be to manage that?

429
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,416
What do you mean?

430
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,458
[ABENO]
Yeah. I know.

431
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,500
Come on, Fuzzy, you gotta
throw it back, all right?

432
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,833
[ASHIYA laughs]

433
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,250
Aw, buddy.

434
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,916
[ASHIYA laughing]

435
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,625
[FUZZY]
Thank you.

436
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,083
[ASHIYA]
You are so freakin' adorable!

437
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,666
[ASHIYA laughing]

438
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,416
[ASHIYA]
Uhh...

439
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,708
Abeno!

440
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,041
[ABENO]
Huh?

441
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,666
[ASHIYA] Um, can Fuzzy
stay at my house tonight?

442
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,541
[ABENO]
What?

443
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:09,333
[ABENO sighs]

444
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:10,916
[ABENO]
Yeah. Sure.
