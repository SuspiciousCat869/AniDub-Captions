00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:17,916
[ABENO sighs]

2
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,500
[ASHIYA] That sigh means
I'm about to get a lecture.

3
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:24,666
I know he said keep
a low profile, but still.

4
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,750
Telling her was
the right thing to do.

5
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,416
He has to agree
with me on that.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,500
[ASHIYA]
Here it comes.

7
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:37,333
"You can't follow orders!
You're like a child!"

8
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,041
That's what he'll say.

9
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,208
[gulps]

10
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,458
[ASHIYA]
Oh, man.

11
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,000
He's about to explode with rage.

12
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,750
Back away slowly.

13
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,291
[ABENO]
Nice work. Thank you.

14
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:34,041
[ASHIYA]
Uh...?

15
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,125
[coughing]

16
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,583
What's wrong?

17
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:38,791
[ASHIYA]
Seriously?!

18
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,333
Yes. What the hell's
gotten into you?

19
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:41,458
What did that mean?

20
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,291
You actually said "thank you."

21
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,916
Yes. What do you mean,
"What did it mean?"

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,875
You found the ring. Nice going.

23
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,208
Calm down.

24
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,041
You earned your keep today.

25
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,833
If I'd been working on my own,
there wouldn't have been

26
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,625
a happily ever after.

27
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,875
Seemed appropriate
to say "thank you."

28
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,666
I don't know about you, but
I'm marking this one down

29
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,041
as "achievement unlocked." 

30
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,250
[ASHIYA]
"Achievement?"

31
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,916
I kinda feel like maybe
you're praising me.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,750
Uh-oh. You must
not be feeling well.

33
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:09,833
Are you dying?

34
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,208
[ABENO]
No. And unless you want to be,

35
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,041
take the damn compliment.

36
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,083
[ASHIYA] Ah. There's
the Abeno I'm used to.

37
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,125
[ABENO]
You're a jackass.

38
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:21,750
[ASHIYA laughing]

39
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,625
What? Knock if off already.
You're creeping me out.

40
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,208
[ASHIYA]
Sorry.

41
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,166
It's just, you've never actually
given me a compliment before.

42
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,250
I'm not sure I know
how to handle it.

43
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,791
[laughing]

44
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,291
[ASHIYA]
I've got the giggles!

45
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,250
[laughing]
Totally involuntary, I swear!

46
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,000
[ASHIYA laughing]

47
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,291
Huh? What is it?

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,791
--[slapping noise]
--[ASHIYA] Ow!

49
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,041
[ABENO]
There, problem solved.

50
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,958
[ASHIYA]
You slapped me in the face!

51
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,125
[ABENO] You're not
giggling anymore, are you?

52
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,458
[ASHIYA]
Well, no, but...!

53
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,125
So tired.

54
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:01,166
[ASHIYA] Exorcist stuff for
days on end without a break.

55
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,583
Homework.
Help around the shop.

56
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,250
I can't keep this up
for much longer.

57
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,666
[ZENKO]
Hanae.

58
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,833
[ASHIYA] If I don't watch it,
they'll start calling me

59
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,958
"that kid from the
nurse's office" again.

60
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,000
[ZENKO]
Hanae.

61
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,458
[ASHIYA]
Uh-huh?

62
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,208
Must be hearing things.

63
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,125
Good morning.

64
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,625
Zenko, what--?

65
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,708
Volume.

66
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,125
My bad. Sorry.

67
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,291
Oh, that's right.

68
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,333
I forgot you and I
go to the same school.

69
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,000
How'd you know I was in
this particular class, though?

70
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,916
I just asked
around some, is all.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,625
You have a reputation.

72
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,833
Guy next to me called you "that
kid from the nurse's office."

73
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,666
Goodie. It's made it
to the other classes.

74
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,750
Listen.

75
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,625
Thanks for helping
the other day.

76
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,333
I meant to say it then,
but I didn't get the chance.

77
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,125
It's okay. No thanks needed.

78
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,250
I helped 'cause I wanted to.

79
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,333
Wait, so that's it?

80
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,208
I mean, is that the whole reason
you bothered to track me down?

81
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,291
Uh... Well, yeah.

82
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,375
For starters, I guess. Hey.

83
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,416
Hey.

84
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,875
Aren't you that little girl?

85
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,083
The one who lives
in the Seiryuji temple?

86
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,208
You were the kimono guy
hiding in our closet, right?

87
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,250
Name's Abeno. Pleasure.

88
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,083
Oh, I'm Zenko Fujiwara.

89
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,666
Nice to meet you.

90
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,666
--She's a high school student?
--He's a high school student?

91
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,916
I'm glad that I ran
into both of you today.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,750
There's something
I wanted to ask about.

93
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,583
Do you know what this is?

94
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,666
A tattoo?

95
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,500
[ZENKO]
No.

96
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,791
Looks like a bite mark.

97
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:37,750
Does it hurt?

98
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,166
[ZENKO]
Not really.

99
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,250
But you can see it? It's there?

100
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:47,416
I showed a few other people,
but they couldn't see a thing.

101
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,375
Doctor had a look at it, too.

102
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,958
Told me I was fine,
and that it was all in my head.

103
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,916
But if Abeno and I can see
it, then clearly that means...

104
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:04,208
[ABENO] Zenko, look out
the window for a second.

105
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,666
Notice anything strange?

106
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:07,958
[ASHIYA]
Sure do.

107
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,250
[ZENKO]
Hanae.

108
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,541
Is that one of the <i>yokai</i>
you were telling me about

109
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,416
the other day?

110
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,958
You can see it too?

111
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,750
[ZENKO]
Not just that one.

112
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,458
Since the dog bit me,
I've seen them everywhere.

113
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,541
The dog?

114
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,416
[ZENKO]
That might not be the best word.

115
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,875
I'm not totally sure.

116
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,416
The bite came out of nowhere.

117
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,041
Could've very well been
a <i>yokai</i> in dog form.

118
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,458
Did you happen to get a look?

119
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,791
Afterwards.

120
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,291
There was, like,
smoke all around.

121
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,958
The ears were huge.

122
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,708
Now that I think about it,
it was more of a...

123
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,916
Fox, maybe?

124
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,625
[FOX]
Oopsie!

125
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,916
Rude! Didn't see that coming.

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,375
What's the big idea?

127
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,208
That's what I was gonna ask you.

128
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,750
Who in the hell are you?

129
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:58,958
[ABENO]
Impossible...

130
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,125
I didn't sense him
until he touched me.

131
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,500
[ASHIYA] Why is Abeno
all freaked out?

132
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,875
That can't be a good omen.

133
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,000
[ABENO] I've never met a
<i>yokai</i> in the mundane world

134
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,375
so in control of its own power.

135
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,041
How long since one was reported?

136
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,583
A hundred years?

137
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,833
I guess monsters do still exist.

138
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,833
[FOX]
Hello, there.

139
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,333
In case you were wondering...

140
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,708
I bit the girl.

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,625
Haruitsuki!

142
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:25,875
Don't be that way!

143
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,750
You haven't forgotten about me.

144
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,666
I'm guessing there some kind
of history between you two?

145
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,041
Is he one of your clients?

146
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,208
You do business with
a lot of these things.

147
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,250
If he were a client,
I'd remember.

148
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,208
[FOX] Meh. Kind of
makes sense you don't.

149
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,750
You were just a widdle-biddy
thing back then.

150
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,250
And I look a lot
different than I used to.

151
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,916
Sounds like I was right.

152
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,500
Well, it's fine.

153
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,083
You not remembering
won't hurt anything.

154
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:53,333
Heh. After all, I've only
come here to play with you.

155
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,250
Things are just so terribly
boring these days.

156
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,958
You don't mind playing
with me for a while,

157
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,166
do you, old friend?

158
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,583
Is he serious?

159
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,458
Then again...

160
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,958
It's not like you can turn
down my invitation, now, is it?

161
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,333
[ZENKO gasps]

[ASHIYA]
Zenko!

163
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,250
[FOX] Between letting your
friend's arm waste away

164
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,833
and indulging a simple request,
it seems pretty obvious to me

165
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,416
which option you'll go with.

166
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,000
Now... What do ya say?

167
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:25,041
Lets play some hide-and-seek
like in the old days, huh?

168
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,916
It's gonna be loads of fun!

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,791
Do it and I'll remove the mark.

170
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,166
That's all you want?

171
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,083
[FOX]
Yep! Easy peasy.

172
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,333
You know the rules?

173
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,791
Really?

174
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,208
Don't tell me this is the
first time you've heard of it!

175
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,500
Ugh. If you're a noob,
you can move along.

176
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,916
I only want people who
know hide-and-seek.

177
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,625
I know how to play
hide-and-seek!

178
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:47,958
Give me some credit!

179
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,875
I killed it in middle school!

180
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,208
[ZENKO]
Middle school?

181
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,375
[ABENO]
In other words, last year.

182
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,416
Oh, good.

183
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,208
So you do know
how the game works.

184
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,500
Excellent. Great.

185
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll hide.
You three are "it." Ready?

186
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,583
Hang on.

187
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,500
The three of us can't just drop
everything to play with you.

188
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:10,375
Why not? How come?

189
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,625
[whining]

190
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,750
No fair! I wanna play!

191
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,583
C'mon! No, no, no, no, no!
Either we do hide--

192
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,958
Zenko, please.

193
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,458
If we don't do
what the fox wants,

194
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,416
you may be stuck
with that mark forever.

195
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,666
Oh, well.

196
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,875
[FOX] Come on! I'm bored!
Just play with me!

197
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,000
[ASHIYA] Wow. He's throwing
a straight-up tantrum.

198
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,375
We can't play now.

199
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,583
[FOX]
How come?

200
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,666
We're in school.
We have classes to get to.

201
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,708
So what?

202
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,375
Who cares about school?
Let's play!

203
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,875
[ZENKO]
Sorry.

204
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,833
If you wanna play with us,
it'll have to wait till later.

205
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,583
For now just go to my family's
temple and be patient.

206
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,500
When school gets out,
hide-and-seek it is.

207
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,583
[FOX sighs]

208
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:47,875
'Kay, fine.

209
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,083
He's cool with that?

210
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,291
[ZENKO]
Good boy.

211
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,333
Yeah, yeah.

212
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,041
Just be there after
school gets out.

213
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,125
[ABENO]
Wait.

214
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,083
I don't think
I caught your name.

215
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,750
Sorry if I don't recognize you.

216
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,458
If you told me
your name, though...

217
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,625
[FOX] Better if you try to
remember on you own, Haruitsuki.

218
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:11,875
[ASHIYA]
He's gone.

219
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:18,208
I wish I knew what he
was getting out of all this.

220
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,750
Doesn't seem to me
like the Underworld

221
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,500
is on his list of priorities.

222
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,833
Yeah, it's weird.

223
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,500
Maybe he just really loves
playing hide-and-seek.

224
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,833
One thing's for sure...

225
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,500
Our priority is getting that
mark removed pronto.

226
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,916
You're right.

227
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,541
So we'll go to my place
after school's out. And play.

228
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,833
[phone ringing]

Dark. Deserted.

00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,041
Creepy statues.

Answer your phone, Abeno!

233
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,166
Ugh. Of all the days
for this to happen.

234
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,416
Okay.

235
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,208
So, any volunteers to
help me organize files

236
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,500
after class today?

237

[STUDENTS groan]

238
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,208
[HOMEROOM TEACHER 1A]
Great. Perfect.

239
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,541
Ashiya it is.

240
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,708
Me?

241
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,166
Since you were out
the first week of class,

242
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,875
this will be an opportunity
to catch up on everything

243
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,208
you missed back then.

244
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,916
[ASHIYA] That'd be great,
sir, except that, um,

245
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,458
well, I kind of
already have plans.

246
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,333
Uh, right, Abeno?

247
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,375
Huh? You don't need
to be there, actually.

248
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,333
I'll just take the hairball
with me. It's fine.

249
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,875
[ASHIYA]
Huh?

250
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,041
[ASHIYA] Like I'm gonna
let you do this on your own.

251
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,375
If you haven't figured it
out yet, I'm a worrier.

252
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,458
It's so late, are they still
playing hide-and-seek,

253
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,583
or is everything cool?

254
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,750
Might help if you picked up!

255
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,416
Should'a thought to ask
Zenko for her number.

Hey, Abeno!

You guys still playing
hide-and-seek, or what?

00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:44,916
I'm here!

260
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,541
[ASHIYA] Am I crazy, or did
something hit me in the back

261
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,541
just now?

262
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,291
Where is everybody?

Nothing lying around
that could'a done it.

If it was a <i>yokai</i> ,
I'd have seen them.

00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,458
Is this place haunted?

poked my back!

Oh my god, it's a ghost!

Oh, thank goodness.

[ASHIYA]
Um... Okay.

279
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,208
We're playing hide-and-seek
in a graveyard.

280
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,083
Lot of places to hide.

281
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,583
Isn't it bad luck?

282
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,166
Wow. It's so dark
I can't see where it ends.

283
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,708
Abeno was walking around
this section a little while ago,

284
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:40,791
I think.

285
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,166
[ASHIYA]
There he is.

286
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,708
[ABENO]
Found you.

287
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:52,833
Hey.

[FOX]
Aw! You're too good at this.

289
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,875
Did that headstone just talk?

290
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,333
Abeno!

291
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,333
Nice job, Haruitsuki.

292
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,750
You found me!

293
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,375
Next time I'll find an
even better place to hide.

294
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,625
[ASHIYA]
Wait, did...?

295
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,791
Did the fox change
himself into a headstone?

296
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,958
Oh, hi. Did you just get here?

297
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,333
You're late.

298
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,458
Yeah, I know.

299
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,208
Looks like I missed
a pretty fun game.

300
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,708
Oh, well.

301
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,750
Whaddya say you go on and remove
the mark from Zenko's arm?

302
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,458
[FOX]
Again!

303
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,750
Just one more round!

304
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,083
What's he doing?
Where did he go?

305
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,541
We were supposed to have a deal!

306
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,833
I thought you played with him!

307
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,125
I suck at this.

308
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,541
Fuzzy found him twice.

309
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,291
Abeno twenty times now.

310
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,708
Yeah?

311
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,875
Whenever we find him, he
always insists on going again.

312
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,333
Why else do you think
Abeno looks like somebody's

313
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,666
run him over?

314
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,791
[ABENO sighs]
"One more round," huh?

315
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,291
You know, I thought
he looked a little tired.

316
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,083
Well, you can take
a break now, Abeno!

317
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,958
The hide-and-seek
champion has arrived!

I was gonna ask.

any bells yet, or...?

320

No, not really.

321
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:00,625
I've figured out
a few things, though.

322
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,375
He's able to transform himself
into a variety of shapes,

323
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,750
like the headstone.

324
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,125
He's good a concealing
his presence, too.

325
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,416
Bizarre.

326
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,083
[ABENO] Oh, and like
someone else we know,

327
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,833
he behaves like a five-year-old.

328
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,916
[ASHIYA] Could you please stop
glaring at me like that?

329
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,166
[ABENO]
Whatever.

330
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,541
Just keep playing until
the fox is satisfied.

331
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,208
Oh-ho! Don't you worry, boss!

332
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,541
When I'm done, he'll be
sick of hide-and-seek!

333
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,083
You're really raring
to go, aren't you?

334
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,208
[ASHIYA]
So what's the trick?

335
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,000
How have you been able
to lock onto him

336
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,958
when he's not in his fox form?

337
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,666
I just wander around.

338
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,541
When I'm getting warmer, I can
feel it in the back of my mind.

339
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:34,958
All right!

340
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,291
Easy enough.

341
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,875
Just wander around.

342
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,916
[ASHIYA]
Um, anybody care to join me?

343
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,291
You're choking me.

344
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,166
Ugh. Getting anything?

345
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,041
[ASHIYA]
Not yet, but I'm looking.

346
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,250
[FOX]
Again!

347
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:58,750
[ZENKO]
Oh, come on.

348
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,791
We were just over there.

349
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,458
[ASHIYA] I didn't feel
anything different.

350
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,833
Hey, Abeno!

351
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,583
We're not picking up on him,
even when we're close!

352
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:09,916
[ABENO]
What?

353
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,208
I can't hear you!

354
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,958
[ASHIYA] I said we're
not picking up on him

355
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,791
even when we're close!

356
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,791
[ABENO]
'Cause you're not focusing!

357
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,708
So we have to focus now?

358
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:22,583
I guess, but what are
we supposed to focus on?

359
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,250
It's like Zen meditation.

360
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,375
If we just clear our
minds, concentrate,

361
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,541
and sharpen our senses, then...

362
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,041
...we should be all set.

363
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,041
Yeah. Good plan.

364
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,458
Whoa! I felt something!

365
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,958
Like I was being drawn in.

366
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,750
What do you see?

367
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,333
Nothing, but I think I might
know where he's hiding.

368
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,291
This path will take
us straight to him.

369
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,625
I assume I'm leading?

370
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:55,583
We have to hurry!

371
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:56,708
[ZENKO]
Don't push.

372
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,708
It's okay.
Let me just try it again.

373
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:09,708
Heads up.

374
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,291
[ASHIYA]
What are you doing?

375
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,625
[ABENO]
Shh!

376
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,708
All right, here's the thing.

377
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,250
He's disguised himself
as a grave marker again.

378
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,416
If we want this to end,
we're gonna have to catch him.

379
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,916
Yeah, I guess so.

380
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,166
But isn't he gonna
throw a tantrum?

381
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,333
[ABENO] We're not making
any headway like this.

382
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,458
Maybe <i>yoko</i> 'll listen to reason.

383
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:32,916
Well, hey.

384
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,250
At least knowing his name
gives us something to go on!

385
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,125
[ABENO]
Huh?

386
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,791
You called him "Yoko" just now.

387
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,833
Oh, uh... That's
not his actual name.

388
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,541
<i>Yoko</i> is really just another
way of saying a "fox <i>yokai</i> ."

389
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,458
Ah. That's news to me.

390
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,250
That's something
you should know.

391
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,916
How has a servant
of the Mononokean

392
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,500
never heard of a <i>yoko</i> ?

393
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,458
Mononokean?

394
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,166
[ASHIYA]
"Servant?"

395
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,250
[ABENO sighs]

396
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,875
Anyway...
If we're gonna catch him,

397
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,041
we have to be sneaky
about it, all right?

398
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,500
Last thing we want is for
him to see what we're up to.

399
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,541
So, to be on the safe side,

400
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,041
you, Zenko, and Fuzzy
hide somewhere nearby.

401
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,250
Sounds good.

402
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,041
Have you got a better idea?

403
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,333
Not really.

404
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,083
This just seems...

405
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,125
I dunno.

406
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,958
Sorry if I'm wrong.

407
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,375
'Bout what?

408
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,458
[ASHIYA]
Well...

409
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,000
[ASHIYA]
Found you. Game over.

410
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,166
Um... What're you talking about?

411
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,458
Ha! I knew it!

412
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,541
No way he'd be so calm!

413
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,375
I don't know if
I'm the best judge.

414
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:46,500
I've only met the guy twice.

415
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,958
You're a moron.

416
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:48,666
[ASHIYA]
Wait...

417
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,208
Now he's acting normal.

418
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,000
Okay.

419
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,333
Fine. You got me.

420
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,208
Abeno?

421
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,500
Dang it.

422
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,875
I was so sure you
wouldn't figure it out, too.

423
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,125
I thought shape-shifting
into Haruitsuki

424
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,958
for a round or two would be a
good way to keep things fresh.

425
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,375
So much for that.

426
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,958
Well, let's go again!

427
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,500
[ASHIYA]
Time out!

428
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,083
We can't keep doing this!

429
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,208
Abeno!

430
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,000
I caught the <i>yoko</i> !

431
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,708
[ABENO] I can't make out
what you're saying.

432
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,708
[ASHIYA] Can you just
come over here, please?

433
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,666
Argh! What's your problem?

434
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,416
Look, I'll keep playing
hide-and-seek with you,

435
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,125
but first you've got to erase
the mark you put on Zenko!

436
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,291
[ZENKO]
Wow.

437
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,208
How'd you figure out
it wasn't Abeno?

438
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,416
I would've never known.

439
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,708
I dunno.

440
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,375
Guess something just
seemed a little off to me.

441
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,375
My transformation
was a dead-ringer!

442
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,166
It wasn't about how you looked.

443
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,666
You called me a servant.

444
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,583
Abeno always says "employee."

445
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,500
While we're at it, he also
doesn't call Fuzzy "Fuzzy."

446
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,833
Ever.

447
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:49,958
[ZENKO]
What does he call him?

448
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,750
[ASHIYA]
Hairball.

449
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:52,833
[ABENO]
Guys.

450
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,833
What the hell's
going on over here--?

451
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:58,833
What?

452
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,625
What am I holding in my arms?

453
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:01,666
The hairball.

454
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,708
All right, then.

455
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,000
He's the real thing.

456
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,166
See?

457
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,750
[FOX] You won't be
able to tell next time!

458
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:07,666
Huh?

459
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,291
Aw! Haruitsuki!

460
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,541
Ashiya said he wouldn't
play with me anymore!

461
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,666
That's not true!

462
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,750
You're lying!
That's not what I said!

463
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,708
I told you I'd keep playing
after you remove Zenko's mark!

464
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,541
You say that, but once
I do, you'll just run off!

465
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,916
You'll have to play with me
for three whole days first!

466
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,291
Three days? In a row?

467
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,208
We're gonna be stuck
playing hide-and-seek with him

468
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,625
for the rest of our lives.

469
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,500
[ABENO]
Three days...

470
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,625
Wait a minute...

471
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:31,666
That's it!

472
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,791
[VOICE]
Hey. I know you.

473
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,625
You're the kid from
the Mononokean.

474
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,500
Do you wanna play?

475
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,416
[FOX yelling]

476
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,791
[ASHIYA]
That's not how it works!

477
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,791
No! We're playing!
We're playing! We're playing!

478
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,708
I don't have a choice.
We have to go to school!

479
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:47,833
School's dumb!

480
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,416
Play, or her mark
stays there forever!

481
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
[ABENO]
Yahiko?

482
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,875
Of course!

483
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,125
You're Yahiko!

484
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,875
Haruitsuki.

485
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,250
I thought you forgot.

486
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,166
You do remember my name!

487
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,291
--[ASHIYA] What the...?
--[ZENKO] Hanae!

488
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,250
[ASHIYA]
No! He's trying to hide again!

489
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,583
[YAHIKO]
Not this time.

490
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:12,791
Ooh!

491
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,500
Walking on all fours
really wears you out.

492
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,166
Sure took you long enough
to remember who I am.

493
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,500
What did you expect?

494
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,833
This is my first time ever
seeing you in fox form.

495
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,500
I guess we both look
pretty different now, huh?

496
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,666
You've gotten so tall.

497
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,791
How long has it been?
About thirty years?

498
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,250
Thirty years?

499
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,041
I hadn't even been
born thirty years ago.

500
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,666
It's only been eight years.

501
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,750
Right around the time that
I first became an employee

502
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,291
of the Mononokean.

503
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:42,000
[ASHIYA] Abeno starting doing
exorcisms eight years ago?

504
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,500
How old would he
have been back then?

505
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,875
Seven?

506
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,500
[ASHIYA] You've been working
since you were seven?

507
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,583
What kind of debt
are you paying off?

508
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,750
I didn't start the way you did.

509
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,958
Who was the master of the
Mononokean back in those days?

510
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:58,041
If I remember correctly,
it was Aoi, isn't that so?

511
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,250
Aoi?

512
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,500
Look at'cha now.

513
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,958
Who'd've ever thought
you'd be the master?

514
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:09,083
Lots of rumors floating around
about how that happened.

515
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,958
Eight years, huh?

516
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,750
How things have changed.

517
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,791
I didn't think the
master ever would.

518
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,625
Yahiko...

519
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,875
[ZENKO gasps]

520
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,000
It hurts.

521
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:22,875
Zenko!

522
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,041
Stop! Now!

523
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:27,583
[FOX] Oh, Haruitsuki.
The things I hear.

524
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,208
[ABENO]
Please.

525
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,208
[ASHIYA]
Oh, no.

526
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:48,166
This is what it feels like
to be possessed.

527
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,375
Like I said... Heh.

528
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:54,166
Lots of rumors floating
around about you.

529
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,208
Is it true that you wanted
to succeed Aoi so badly...

530
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,166
...you killed for the job?

531
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:34,875
[ASHIYA]
So I was right.

532
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:37,166
You and the fox
do know each other.

533
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,041
[ABENO]
Yeah.

534
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,125
[ASHIYA]
Cool.

535
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,583
What about dogs
and monkeys and stuff?

536
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,125
You friends with
anything like that?

537
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,083
[ABENO]
Shut up.

538
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,458
I'm not Doctor Doolittle.
