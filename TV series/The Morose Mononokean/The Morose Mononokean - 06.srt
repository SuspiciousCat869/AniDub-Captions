You're concerned, sure,

00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:10,916
but logically, the odds
of it happening again--

[ABENO]
Legislator...

4
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:14,375
Don't go there.

5
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:16,000
Move it! You're in the way!

6
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,041
Bye. Good to
see you, Legislator.

7
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,291
[ASHIYA] Hey. You seem
pretty mad all of a sudden.

8
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,291
What's wrong?

9
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,291
Was it something I said to him?

10
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,750
You're an idiot,
but he pisses me off!

11
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,916
[ABENO] There are several
reasons for us being late

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,583
besides seeing that guy.

13
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,625
I am so sorry.

14
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,583
I probably broke
every single one of 'em.

15
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,791
"Probably"? Try "definitely."

16
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,000
You're like a walking
magnet that can only attract

17
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,625
pains in the ass.

18
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,791
[ASHIYA] I really didn't
mean to do anything wrong.

19
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:34,833
[bell ringing]

20
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,708
It was scary.

21
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,375
But I'm fully aware
that I brought on

22
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,625
all the trouble myself.

23
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:51,500
And anyway, some pretty
cool things happened too.

24
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:54,416
I really enjoyed
meeting Koura and Shizuku.

25
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,750
The legislator allowed me
to be an official employee.

26
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,875
And Fuzzy's back with me!

27
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,958
You said it would
be a good experience,

28
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,000
and I learned so
much down there.

[bell ringing]

30
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,875
You're thanking me?

[ABENO sighs]

32
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:19,750
I'm beat.

33
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,125
So, as you know,

34
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,083
my daughter is going
to be five years old soon.

35
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,583
And it's...

36
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,291
[STUDENTS] Come on, do you
always have to talk about her

37
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,708
during class?!

[HOMEROOM TEACHER 1A]
...drew an amazing picture...

39
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,375
[ASHIYA] We're looking
for a ring this time?

40
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,875
An odd thing
for a <i>yokai</i> to lose.

41
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,750
It's just a regular
wedding ring.

42
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:39,541
[ASHIYA]
Then what's the deal?

43
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,583
[bell rings]

44
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:42,958
[ASHIYA]
An old woman?

45
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,750
Since her husband passed away,

46
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,041
she's been wearing both
hers and his wedding bands

47
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,958
as a kind of a remembrance.

48
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,458
Unfortunately, while she
was out on a walk one day,

49
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,083
hers dropped off her finger.

50
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:57,208
[ASHIYA] I bet that's
gonna be tough to find.

51
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,708
His ring's possessed.

52
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,416
The <i>yokai</i> who's attached
to it is who hired us.

53
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,125
Our job's to find it
and give it back to the lady.

He wants to move on
to the Underworld,

but this happens first.

It's a pretty
straightforward gig.

[ASHIYA]
Three times?

59
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,416
More eyes looking means
we have a greater chance

60
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,750
of finding the thing
and getting it over with.

61
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,750
The usual place
and time, right?

62
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,333
I'm sure it hasn't changed.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,958

it to the next class!

Hey, Teacher?

[HOMEROOM TEACHER 1A]
Yes, what is it?

I would just really like
to get out of here soon

and go to the store.

stop babbling now?

he actually said it!

Oh. I suppose I let the time

get away from me.

All right, then,

he was gonna ramble

on and on like that.

I just wanted to get
out and go to the store.

Ashiya was all pale and looked
like he was about to die,

he was about to rip

if he wanted to go
to the store with me.

We got here as soon as we could.

if you hung back inside.

this is our fourth meeting

somewhere around here?

130

[ABENO] Yeah, but we've
been looking for a while.

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,958
[ASHIYA] The current may
have washed it away.

times we come here,

we find that ring, ya hear?

Yeah.

139
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,416
That should be pretty obvious.

And there's no reason you
need to be twisting my arm

141

over it now.

take through to the end.

and that's a promise.

[MANJIRO]
Hm...

148
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,291
[ABENO]
That's a bold claim.

149
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,708
Ever since I was a little kid,

150
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,625
I've been good at finding
metal things like earrings

151
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,583
and scissors and stuff,
so a ring should be easy.

152
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,625
Yeah? Weirdly specific talent.

153
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,541
What if I find
it before you do?

154
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,583
Will you give me a bonus?

155
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,250
[ABENO] Yo, Hairball,
look on the shore, would ya?

156
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,708
There's no sense in
pushing yourself too hard.

157
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,250
[ASHIYA]
Okay!

158
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,375
I feel like it's this way!

with your hands?

00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,250
This is serious!

162
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,916
[ASHIYA]
Trust me. I know what I'm doing.

163
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,958
[MANJIRO]
Hmph.

164
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,041
[MANJIRO]
You punks sure talk a big game,

165
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,458
so you'd better make
good on finding it!

166
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,541
[ABENO]
I know. We discussed this!

167
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,791
[ABENO]
Where is it?

168
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:48,166
[MANJIRO coughing]

169
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,166
Hey, Manjiro.

170
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,083
Just let us handle
this part of it.

171
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,375
You need to get out of here.

172
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,958
Go back over to
the old lady's place

173
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,833
and near her husband's ring.

174
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,791
You're not supposed to stay
away from it for very long.

175
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,208
And you can't hide
the fact that spending

176
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,666
this much time
in the mundane world

177
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,708
is affecting your body.

178
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,708
I mean, look how
big you've gotten.

179
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,875
[MANJIRO] Hmph! I know
what's happening to me, son!

180
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,666
Hey! Come on!

181
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,916
Just to be clear...

182
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,958
Whether I've found
the ring or not,

183
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:21,291
if I think you're in danger,
make no mistake, Manjiro.

184
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,708
I will exorcise you by force.

185
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:24,958
[ASHIYA]
Hey, Abeno!

186
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,000
[ASHIYA laughing]

187
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,666
[ASHIYA]
Is this it?

188
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,750
You guys! Look, look!

189
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,625
This has gotta be the ring!

190
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,875
[ABENO] Did he really
just use his instincts?

191
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,958
[ASHIYA] I told you I was a
natural at finding metals,

192
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,041
didn't I?

193
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,833
[MANJIRO]
Hey! Let me get a look at that!

194
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:43,916
[ASHIYA]
Here.

195
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,208
[MANJIRO]
Well, I'll be!

196
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,250
That really is
her ring, all right.

197
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,541
Thanks, kiddo!

198
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:54,458
Let's put that little beauty
back on her finger, pronto!

199
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:58,375
[MANJIRO laughing]

200
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,333
So what's the plan now?

201
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,875
How are we gonna make sure
the old lady gets this thing?

202
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,750
What do you mean, how?

203
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,208
We go track her down
and then give it to her.

204
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,875
"Hey, lady, we got
your ring"? Yeah?

205
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,291
Look. Make whatever point
you're trying to make.

206
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,416
If two dudes walked up
and gave you something

207
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,833
they couldn't know
you were looking for,

208
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,541
wouldn't that freak
you out a bit?

209
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,583
He may have a point.

210
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,208
You reckon it would scare her?

211
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,041
May be.

212
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,708
She would probably just assume
the two of us stole it from her.

213
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,416
You see, all that I'm saying

214
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,750
is that we need
some plan of action.

215
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,083
[ASHIYA] What's a good,
non-scary way to return it?

216
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,250
[ABENO] I say we just
drop it off in her mailbox.

217
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,166
Surely we can think of
something better than that.

218
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,458
[ABENO]
Wait...

219
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,583
Why do you care so much
about how we do this?

220
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,916
Because of him.

221
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,166
Once she has it back,

222
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,250
Manjiro's gonna go on
to the Underworld.

223
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,250
Isn't he?

224
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,416
Uh-huh.

225
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,833
That means this is
gonna be the last time

226
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,583
he'll ever see the old woman.

227
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,583
It was obviously important
to him to make sure

228
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,125
she had it before he left.

229
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,916
And he went so far
as to hire us,

230
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,125
and even searched
around for it himself.

231
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,041
So instead of dropping it off,

232
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,958
it would make it more special
if we told her a bit about him.

233
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:19,916
Right?

234
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,583
[ABENO]
Tell her?

235
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,250
I think it would
be nice if we honored

236
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,500
his commitment to her,

237
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,041
and I'm pretty sure
that it would make her

238
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,791
feel really good as well.

239
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,625
[MANJIRO] So...
Do you have a plan for that?

240
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,208
Uh, not quite yet, per se.

241
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,166
Maybe... we could try--

242
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,583
We really don't need
to go out of our way.

243
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,875
Oh, sorry.

244
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,416
Am I getting ahead
of myself here?

245
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,875
Listen.

246
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,875
I understand the sentiment
behind what you're thinking.

247
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,791
But generally,
people don't like to know

248
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,833
when <i>yokai</i> are
involved in things.

249
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:55,125
Remember, most people can't
see or hear them at all.

250
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,375
So they usually get
pretty creeped out.

251
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,708
Or sometimes worse.

252
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,541
Least that's what happens almost
every time in my experience.

253
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,958
Worst-case scenario...

254
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,291
[ABENO]
The old lady gets a bad vibe

255
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,208
and doesn't want
to take the ring back.

256
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,333
The best course of
action is almost always

257
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:18,250
to finish the job with
minimal human interaction.

258
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,708
[ASHIYA] So it wasn't that he
didn't ever think to plan ahead

259
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,666
about how to return it.

260
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,500
But after giving
it consideration,

261
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,708
based on what
has happened before,

262
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,625
his plan was
"don't get involved."

263
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,916
[ASHIYA]
Sorry, Manjiro.

264
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,541
The last thing I'd
want is for something

265
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,500
to potentially
screw up the job.

266
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,791
I think we're gonna have to
take Abeno's advice on this one.

267
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,291
I got your hopes up
only to disappoint you.

268
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,375
Sorry.

269
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,375
Hey!

270
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,208
--Get your head up, boy!
--[ASHIYA yells]

271
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,250
[ASHIYA groaning]
Jeez! I said I was sorry!

272
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,708
[ABENO]
Please don't beat the help.

273
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,750
[MANJIRO] I swear I didn't
mean to smack you that hard.

274
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,375
I just got a
little carried away,

275
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,666
so I'm the only one
who should be sorry.

276
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,250
You've got absolutely no
reason to be bowing your head

277
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,208
in shame, youngin'.

278
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,833
I appreciate you wanting
to tell her about me.

279
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,041
But we gotta remember
what the job is.

280
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,833
And that's getting
the ring back to her,

281
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,750
not telling stories
about <i>yokai</i> .

282
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,916
So let's have the plan be
to get that done on the sly.

283
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,083
'Cause at the end of the day,

284
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,375
all I want is that
ring on her finger.

285
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,666
Yeah, okay.

286
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,916
Fuzzy?

287
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,416
Uh... What's the deal?

288
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,625
Seems like the fluffy
one thinks we should go

289
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,500
with Abeno's plan and
just drop the ring off.

290
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,583
So, we're all
in agreement, then.

291
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,125
Let's go.

292
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,083
Well, Manjiro.
Please lead the way.

293
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:47,958
[MANJIRO]
Sure.

294
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,666
It's not that far from here.

295
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,791
Put the ring in the mailbox
and she should find it

296
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,750
before too long.

297
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,041
[ASHIYA] Not telling her
is the best way, I suppose.

298
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:00,250
I mean... It makes a
lot of sense, but...

299
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,916
[ABENO]
Come on.

300
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,083
[ASHIYA]
Okay.

301
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,916
[ASHIYA] I can't stop wondering
if there's another way

302
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,166
we could do this
so she'll know the story.

303
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,916
This is the place, guys.

304
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,208
Would've been quicker
with the Mononokean.

305
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,000
I can't believe that
you were making the trek

306
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,500
all the way to the
creek from here.

307
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,666
Shoo, I would've at
least taken a bike.

308
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,458
[MANJIRO] That's way easier
when you have legs.

309
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,041
[ASHIYA]
It looks like it's closed now,

310
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,791
but what kind of shop was this?

311
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,791
[MANJIRO]
Hm... An eel shop.

312
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,208
[ABENO, ASHIYA]
Ah.

313
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,041
[ABENO]
Is this her mailbox?

314
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,583
[MANJIRO]
No, she doesn't use this one.

315
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,916
Come around back.

316
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,291
[ASHIYA]
Is she not home?

317
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,708
[MANJIRO] Well, the lights are
on, so she's probably inside.

318
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,083
This box, here.

319
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,291
[ASHIYA] Just put it
in there and it's over?

320
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,916
There's so much
I want to tell her;

321
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,625
the story is really endearing.

322
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,541
People can't see <i>yokai</i> .

323
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:25,666
So the <i>yokai</i> are stuck on like,
an emotional one-way street.

324
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,375
They can care, but no one
even knows they exist.

325
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,333
If people could see them,

326
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,833
so much more about life
would open up to them.

327
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,166
[ASHIYA]
"If people could see them".

328
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,833
Well, what about me? I can.

329
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,125
Just do it!

330
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,250
Hold on. Who are you?

331
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,416
Oh, crap!

332
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,000
Damn it! What the hell
is wrong with you?

333
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,458
Young man!

334
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,708
What are you sneaking
around my house for?

335
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,166
Well, ma'am...

336
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,500
[ABENO]
Idiot.

337
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,083
"Well" what?

338
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,083
You're trying to put
something in my mailbox!

339
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,000
[ASHIYA] Yes ma'am,
but I can explain!

340
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,791
Huh? That's my wedding ring!

341
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,166
What on earth are
you doing with it?

342
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,208
[ASHIYA]
Um...

343
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,541
You don't have to explain.

344
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:20,708
[ASHIYA]
Come on.

345
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,208
[ABENO]
Stop right there, man!

346
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,958
Just finish it.

347
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:31,041
Shake her hand off and
put the ring in the mailbox.

348
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,958
It's not like you won't be
able to get away from her.

349
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,958
You remember?

350
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,708
What I said about people?
This is why.

351
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,250
I remember.

352
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,208
But we're people too.

353
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,958
[ASHIYA] And we can see and
hear more than everybody else.

354
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,958
We know things that regular
folks could only dream of.

355
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,125
Whether or not they understand.

356
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,583
If we just avoid
them all the time

357
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,708
and don't tell
them anything,

358
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,375
they will never understand!

359
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,000
Do you get it?

360
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,375
That's why I'm not
running away from this.

361
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,166
At least I'll tell her who
sent us here before I do.

362
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,541
[ASHIYA]
Oh, no!

363
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,291
I completely pissed him off!

364
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,208
How could I have been so stupid?

365
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,541
He told me exactly why
he wanted to do it his way,

366
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,041
and I screwed it all up!

367
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,791
[OLD WOMAN]
All this stuff about "people."

368
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,958
"Seeing" this, "hearing" that.

369
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,708
Is this some kind
of religious talk?

370
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,291
No, not exactly. I'm sorry.

371
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,250
I'm just panicking right now and
have no idea what I'm saying.

372
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,125
Slow down.
Just pump your brakes, kid.

373
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,291
Like I said, I do
appreciate the thought.

374
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:45,166
But we need to wrap
this thing up real quick like.

375
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,083
So just put the dang
ring in the box!

376
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,166
[ABENO]
Manjiro.

377
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,708
Someone named Manjiro.

378
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,291
He's why we're here.

379
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,625
He wanted us to give
that ring back to you.

380
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,791
[OLD WOMAN]
Manjiro?

381
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,375
Yes. He said it was important.

382
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,666
And that it had a lot of
sentimental value for you.

383
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,458
Sorry, but I can't
explain it any further.

384
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,791
I know how it looks, so I
understand if you don't believe

385
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,250
a word I said.

386
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,708
But please, whatever happens,

387
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,958
I hope you hang on to the ring.

388
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,083
[OLD WOMAN]
My word.

389
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,875
[ABENO]
Yeah, I knew it.

390
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:30,250
I was sure it was gonna
go down like this, but still.

391
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,833
[ASHIYA]
What am I doing?

392
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,458
This is why they
wanted to stay out of it.

393
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,250
If she doesn't take the ring,

394
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,125
the whole job is for nothing.

395
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,291
Look. All we wanted--

396
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,375
[ABENO]
Ashiya!

397
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,958
Don't say anything.

398
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,916
[ASHIYA]
It's all my fault.

399
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,583
I should've listened to them.

400
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,416
I shouldn't have questioned it.

401
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,166
I should've just left it
up to the experts.

402
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,958
I'm still so new at this.

403
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,416
I screwed everything up.

404
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,833
[OLD WOMAN]
I see.

405
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,291
[OLD WOMAN]
Well, I'll be.

406
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,791
Manjiro asked you
to do it, did he?

407
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:14,125
[OLD WOMAN laughing]

408
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,833
Something funny?

409
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,458
I guess Manjiro's ghost
is getting young men

410
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,500
to do favors for him now.

411
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,583
Wait...

412
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,750
Hold on, do you
actually know Manjiro?

413
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,166
Yes, you could say that.

414
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,958
You see, boys,
Manjiro is my late husband.

415
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,000
What?!

416
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,625
He passed away a long time ago.

417
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:38,500
Maybe his ghost came around
because I lost the ring.

418
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,958
And he went and got
the two of you involved.

419
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,833
That's just like him.

420
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:46,291
I was so scared that
I'd lost it forever.

421
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,416
This makes me so happy.

422
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,583
Young man.

423
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:51,708
Yes, ma'am?

424
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,125
Thank you, son.

425
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,125
This was such a nice gesture.

426
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,458
I wish more youngsters
were like you.

427
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,791
[ABENO]
This is a surprise.

428
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,291
She understands.

429
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,583
Thank you.

430
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:05,916
It was my pleasure.

431
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,375
I'm glad you're reunited.

432
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,583
No need for you to bow to me.

433
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,208
If you would,
please hold out your hand.

434
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,250
[OLD WOMAN]
Hm?

435
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,208
[OLD WOMAN laughs]

436
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,125
[ASHIYA]
Hey, Manjiro.

437
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,833
See that smile?

438
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,208
Sweet Manjiro.

439
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,500
Thank you. So much.

440
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,208
[MANJIRO]
Sure!

441
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,416
[ASHIYA gasps]

442
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,250
[MANJIRO, OLD WOMAN
laughing]

443
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,375
[ABENO]
When did I stop telling people

444
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,333
about <i>yokai</i> and how
they're involved in our lives?

445
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,083
[ASHIYA] If we just avoid
them all the time

446
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,458
and don't tell them anything,
they will never understand!

447
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,666
[ABENO] I think I'd given up
on hoping they'd understand

448
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,125
a long time ago.

449
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:05,333
And once I gave up,
I just closed my eyes

450
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,791
and refused to see
things any other way.

451
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,208
But...

452
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,416
Even if they can't
literally see them,

453
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,000
it doesn't mean
they don't feel them.

454
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,625
You should come in.

455
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,666
I was about to go
and get dinner started.

456
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,916
Consider it payment
for finding my ring.

457
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,250
You don't need
to give us anything.

458
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,416
[OLD WOMAN]
Don't be shy.

459
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,333
[MANJIRO]
Stay for dinner; it's worth it.

460
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:29,833
[ASHIYA]
Okay, then, it's a deal.

461
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,625
This is definitely more
involved than I wanted to get.

462
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,375
Come on. Let's get goi--

463
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,666
[VOICE]
I found you.

464
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,041
[OLD WOMAN] How does
some eel sound to you boys?

465
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:44,875
[ABENO]
Ashiya.

466
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,125
What's up?

467
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,458
Just now...

468
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,500
Did you happen
to notice anything?

469
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,250
No, I really didn't.

470
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,875
Is there something wrong?

471
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,000
It's fine.

472
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,833
Forget about it.

473
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,041
[ABENO] I thought I sensed
a strange presence.

474
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,625
Was it my imagination?

475
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,125
[ASHIYA]
Now that you mention it,

476
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,416
