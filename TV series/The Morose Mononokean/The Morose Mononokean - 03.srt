Wake up!

00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,583
What's going on? Talk to me!

4
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:20,958
You all right?

5
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:32,083
You're sleeping? Seriously?

6
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,166
What is wrong with you? Get up!

[ABENO]
Mononokean. Never mind.

10
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:51,000
Come, Momomokean. Here.

11
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,375
[ASHIYA]
That's not how--

[ABENO groans]

13
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,000
So it'll appear even if
you say the words wrong?

14
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,708
Yeah, where do
you live again?

15
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:40,875
My mom's place.

16
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,625
A flower shop in Suzaku
called Hana Ashi.

17
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,416
[ABENO]
You heard him. Let's go.

18
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,875
Front door'll do.

19
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,166
I'm gonna guess
you're sleep-talking.

Huh? What the--?

23
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,875
Hang on. This is our door.

How is it even doing that?

[ABENO]
Special hanging scroll.

[ABENO]
Yes.

It's, uh...

This tearoom's
actually a <i>yokai</i> .

Oh, nice to meet you.

[ABENO]
Great. You've met.

37
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,166
Now leave. Get some rest.

We've got work tomorrow.

[ASHIYA] "Did Itsuki open two
portals to the Underworld?"

Well, yeah: one for Boss Scree
and one for his children.

42
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,166
[ASHIYA] Now that
I think about it, though...

43
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,666
Didn't he tell me he could
only open it twice a day?

44
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,000
Something else he said.

45
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:59,250
[ASHIYA] Did a, uh, <i>yokai</i> used
to be the master of this place?

46
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,083
How'd Abeno get to be in charge?

47

[ABENO]
Ashiya!

48
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,666
[ASHIYA]
Yes, sir?

49
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,916
Quit talking
and get out of here.

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,375
I won't ask again.

51
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,458
[ASHIYA]
Um, right, then.

52
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,750
See you in the morning.

Finally.

--[ASHIYA yelps]

[ASHIYA'S MOM]
How do you feel?

57
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,041
I worry that you're not getting
enough sleep, sweetheart.

58
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,166
Why exactly were you
at school so late?

59
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,750
[ASHIYA]
Uh, no reason.

00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:37,208
[ASHIYA]
Just exorcising some <i>yokai</i> .

61
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:41,500
I know I've gotta pay
off my debt, but still.

62
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,166
I'm not sure how long
I can stand doing this.

63
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,125
[ASHIYA'S MOM] Is high school
really that tough?

64
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,083
[ASHIYA] Well, at least the
fuzz ball and Boss Scree

65
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,666
seemed happy.

66
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,125
It's not easy, but at the
end of the day, worth it.

67
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,125
Mama's little workhorse.

00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,458
[FEMALE STUDENT 3A]
See you tomorrow.

[HOMEROOM TEACHER 1A]
Uh-huh.

70
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,708
Don't forget your homework.

71
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,958

Oh, hello.

00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,541
I'm Saga. This here is Fusshi.

00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,208
How you doin'?

76
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,708
Nice to meet ya.
What can I do for ya?

77
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,291
Wow, do you always
talk so politely?

78
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,875
We thought you could
maybe use some notes

79
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,791
from the days you were out.

80
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,000
Have at 'em, dude.

81
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,083
Just, uh, ignore
the crappy handwriting.

So cool of you!

Uh... No prob.

00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,666
So, uh, where do you live?

85
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,916
In Suzaku.

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,208
Same direction
as us, then. Cool.

87
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,625
We should walk home together.

I'm finally making friends!

This is what the high school
experience is all about!

[FUSSHI]
Let's see what they have.

92
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,500
[FUSSHI]
You forget something?

93
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,000
No, I just thought, uh...

94
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,000
You know, actually I did.

00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,750
We can walk
together tomorrow!

00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,208
What a weird guy.

99
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,250
You can't just pop up
whenever you feel like it!

100
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,000
You could've told me you
weren't gonna be in class,

101
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,208
by the way!

102
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,375
Keep it down!
In case you haven't noticed,

103
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,666
we have a guest.

Sorry.

This is Mitsuchigura.

He's seeking our help.

[MITSUCHIGURA] Thank you
for agreeing to meet with me.

The pleasure's ours.

[ASHIYA crying]

112
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,083
You've, um, barely
made it through

113
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,250
the first couple of pages,
ya big wuss.

114
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,458
[ASHIYA] Leave me alone!
I know where this is going.

115
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,541
Well, as this demonstrates,
he's your man.

116
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,708
[MITSUCHIGURA]
Indeed.

117
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,458
Would you please
tell me what's happening?

118
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,750
[MITSUCHIGURA] Alas, I am
unable to express emotions

119
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,250
on my own, you see.

120
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,583
However, when I wear
the appropriate mask,

121
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,000
the corresponding emotion...

122
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,208
...comes shining through.

123
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,625
[ASHIYA]
Whoa! You're crying!

124
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,416
[MITSUCHIGURA]
That was my crying mask.

125
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,250
This is my rage mask.

126
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,250
What are you looking at,
you little punk?

127
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,000
[ASHIYA] Okay! We get it!
Please take it off!

128
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,166
[MITSUCHIGURA] Master Abeno
was good enough to exorcise me

129
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,666
once upon a time.

130
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,250
Unfortunately, I dropped one
of my masks in the process.

131
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,958
It's of the utmost
importance that I retrieve it.

132
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,583
Naturally, the person
I had in mind

133
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,458
for such an errand was you.

134
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,250
[MITSUCHIGURA] The mask at issue
is my laughing mask.

135
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,250
I fear the unfortunate soul
to whom it is now attached

136
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,333
will die doing just that.

137
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,916
Sounds like it
might be a problem.

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,166
[MITSUCHIGURA] The only way
to remove my laughing mask

139
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,166
is to show it a face
besmirched with tears.

140
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,125
Do what?

141
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,291
You have a gift.

Hey! Come on!

143
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,666
You don't have
to say it like that!

144
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,166
Go do your job.

145
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,250
Find the man who's possessed
by the laughing mask

146
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,500
and cry for him.

147
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,375
[ASHIYA]
A temple?

Uh... Wait, you're not coming?

149
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,916
It's a mask. You'll be fine.

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,500
I mean, a five-year-old
could do it.

151
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,125
Don't be such a baby.

152
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,416
My mom sent me on
errands when I was four!

153

[ABENO]
And your point is...?

154
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,125
[ASHIYA] It's a mask, and I'm
not a baby, so it'll be fine.

155
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,208
Just stay right there!

00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,416
He'll never let you
live it down.

162
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,708
--[ZENKO] Hey!
--[ASHIYA] Yeah?

163
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,458
[ZENKO]
What do you think you're doing?

164
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,416
[ASHIYA gasps]
It's a <i>yokai</i> !

165
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,666
[ZENKO]
Excuse me?

166
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,875
[ASHIYA]
Oh. It's a girl.

167
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,750
What were you doing
in our storage shed?

168
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:52,916
Are you a thief?

169
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,666
Uh, no. I'm just
looking for something.

170
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,791
[ZENKO]
In our shed?

171
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,708
It's a mask of a laughing face.

172
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,333
You seen it by any chance?

173
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,500
I clean this place
every single day.

174
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,250
Never seen any kind of mask.

175
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,583
Why would it be here?

176
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:06,791
Well, you see...

177
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,208
[ASHIYA]
I forgot to ask.

178
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,125
Lying will only
make things worse.

179
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,708
But if you tell me the truth,
I might go easy on you.

180
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,666
[ASHIYA] Is she trying
to strong-arm me?

181
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,750
[ZENKO'S DAD laughing]

182
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,791
That's Dad. Guess he's awake.

183
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,166
[ASHIYA]
Dad?

184
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,708
[ZENKO]
He's still laughing?

185
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:28,458
It doesn't make any sense; he's
always been such a sourpuss.

186
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,166
[ASHIYA]
Bingo.

187
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,208
Wait, so... my dad's
possessed by a <i>yokai</i> ?

188
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,500
Mm-hmm. And that's exactly
why I have to see him.

189
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,041
I was raised right next door
to a graveyard, you know.

190
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,750
If <i>yokai</i> were real,
I'd have seen one by now.

191
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,208
I'm fifteen years old.

192
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,666
I don't believe in that crap.

193
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,125
Whoa! You're fifteen?

194
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,458
But, you're so,
like, iddy biddy.

195
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,458
No way!

196
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:57,833
For the record,
a grade school kid

197
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,250
wouldn't buy your crap either.

198
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,208
A five-year-old could
see through this act.

199
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,708
[ASHIYA]
Déjà vu!

200
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,833
If you don't leave,
I'm calling the police.

201
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:05,958
[ASHIYA]
Okay, okay!

202
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,291
Forget about the <i>yokai</i> !

203
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,416
You don't have to believe me!
It's fine! Just...

204
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,541
Just believe me when I
tell you all I'm really trying

205
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,416
to do here is help your dad!

206
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,083
So, don't believe you,
but believe you.

207
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,833
Sounds like a real
win-win situation to me.

208
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,666
[ASHIYA] Uh, let me
put it another way.

209
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,375
You don't have to "believe" me;
just take my word for it.

210
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,125
Wait. Dang it,
why is this so hard?

211
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,375
[ZENKO]
What's your name?

212
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,333
Mine's Zenko Fujiwara.

213
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:35,041
[ASHIYA] Oh. I'm, uh...
Hanae Ashiya.

214
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,333
[ZENKO]
Hanae?

215
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,708
That's a cute name
for a boy. Huh.

216
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,416
[ASHIYA]
Uh...

217
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,583
[ZENKO]
All right, Hanae.

218
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,833
Follow me.

219
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,958
Hold on, so you think
I'm telling the truth?

220
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,666
More or less.

221
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,750
I think you think
you're telling the truth.

222
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,583
Which means you're
probably nuts.

223
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:56,041
But for the sake of argument,
let's assume <i>yokai</i> are real.

224
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,041
[ZENKO]
Besides...

225
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,708
If you can help my dad,
I'll go along with whatever.

226
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,583
Thanks, Zenko.

227
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,500
I promise this is all real.

228
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,250
I'm not crazy, and I
haven't told a single lie.

229
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,125
[ZENKO'S DAD laughing]

230
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,458
Hey, Dad.

231
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,833
There's someone here
who'd like to meet with you.

232
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,791
[ZENKO'S DAD laughing]

233
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,458
[ZENKO'S DAD]
Wh-Who is it?

234
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,541
Do I know you?

235
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,666
[ASHIYA]
That mark.

236
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,666
It's the same one the <i>yokai</i> had.

237
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,791
He's definitely possessed
by the mask.

238
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:30,916
[ZENKO'S DAD]
I'll kill you.

239
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,541
[laughing]
You're a dead man!

240
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,166
[laughing continues]

241
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,416
[ZENKO'S DAD] She's not old
enough to have a boyfriend!

242
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,958
What? I'm not! I swear!

243
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,000
Calm down. It's not like that.

244
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,708
This guy says he can help you.

245
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,166
[ZENKO'S DAD]
Oh, yeah?

246
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,625
It's kind of hard to
explain, but yes, sir.

247
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,333
If you'd allow me to, I'd be
more than happy to help.

248
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,458
[ZENKO'S DAD]
So you can... [laughing]

249
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,666
You can make it stop?
[laughing]

250
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,291
Yes, I think.

251
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,791
Then do something!

252
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,708
I can't chant my sutras.

253
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,458
[ZENKO]
Hanae?

254
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,791
[ZENKO]
You meant it, right?

255
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,750
You can really fix this?

256
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,375
Make my dad how he used to be?

257
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,375
[laughing continues]

258
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,041
[ASHIYA] She's tough as
nails on the outside,

259
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:21,416
but on the inside,
she's falling apart.

260
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,708
Poor thing.

261
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,125
I had no idea.

262
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:26,666
Uh...

263
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,625
My bad! Sorry!
Ha. Whoops!

264
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,458
How dare you lay a
hand on my little girl?

265
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,208
It was an accident!

266
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,083
Hey, hold on.
He quit laughing for a sec.

267
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,166
[ZENKO]
Daddy.

268
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,041
[ASHIYA] This is worse
than I thought.

269
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,708
This is probably
a dumb question,

270
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,208
but what's with the book?

271
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,291
[ASHIYA] Oh, uh, let's just
say it's guaranteed to work.

272
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,875
Yeah? [knuckles crack]

273
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:50,833
[ASHIYA]
I'm not kidding!

274
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,666
Look! I swear on my life!

275
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,791
[MITSUCHIGURA]
I take it Ashiya has not been

276
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,541
in your employ for long.

277
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,375
[ABENO] My apologies for
having to deal with him.

278
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,333
[MITSUCHIGURA]
No apologies necessary.

279
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,083
Experience will do him good.

280
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,166
Forgive me for saying so.

281
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,125
But you seem more concerned
about his errand than I am.

282
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,458
[clears throat]

283
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,375
[ABENO] Well, to be fair,
following instructions

284
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,916
hasn't shown itself
to be his strong suit.

285
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,250
This one shouldn't
be too hard, though.

286
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,041
I hope.

287
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,416
[ZENKO'S DAD laughing]

288
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,250
[ASHIYA]
It's not working!

289
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,250
I'm too self-conscious to cry!

290
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,500
[laughing continues]

291
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,125
[ZENKO'S DAD] I have
absolutely no intention

292
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,625
of letting you take
my place, young lady.

293
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,750
[ZENKO]
What do you mean?

294
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,750
Who else is gonna
run the temple?

295
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,916
You don't trust me
to do a good job?

296
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,125
[ZENKO'S DAD]
That has nothing to do with it.

297
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:52,166
I am not leaving this
temple to my daughter.

298
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,458
[ZENKO]
Seriously?

299
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,041
I don't believe this.

300
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,000
He doesn't want me
to because I'm a girl.

301
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
[ZENKO'S DAD]
Sit down!

302
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,250
I'm not finished talking!

303
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,000
This isn't what I--

304
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,458
[ZENKO]
I get it, okay?

305
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,333
I'm not succeeding you.

306
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,958
Conversation's over.

307
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,750
[ASHIYA]
Patrasche crept closer yet,

308
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,708
and laid his head upon
the young boy's breast.

309
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:20,166
The great tears stood
in his brown, sad eyes...

310
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,250
[ZENKO]
Is that a spell?

311
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,541
[ASHIYA]
What's wrong with me?

312
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,583
I should be a blubbering
mess by now.

313
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,208
Maybe it's time to go back
and tell Abeno I can't.

314
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,083
Dang it!

315
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,541
I'm screwed. Serves me right.

316
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,083
Why did I give him attitude?

317
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,208
[ZENKO]
Are you okay?

318
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,708
I'm having a little trouble.

319
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,500
Just give me some time.

320
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,833
[ZENKO] Why don't you
take a break and help me

321
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,041
clean up the yard?

322
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,750
It'll be dark
before you know it.

323
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,583
I wanna finish up while
we still have enough light.

324
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,791
You comfortable with
pulling weeds 'n stuff?

325
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,083
[ASHIYA]
Sure. No prob.

326
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,083
[ASHIYA]
A break, huh?

327
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,791
Might be good for charging
up the ol' tear glands.

328
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,083
[ASHIYA] Do you clean this
whole place every day?

329
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,041
[ZENKO]
Mm-hmm.

330
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,916
[ASHIYA]
All by yourself?

331
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,291
Yeah, well, you know.

332
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,583
It's a labor of love.

333
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,708
[ZENKO] This is where
I've spent my whole life.

334
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,208
Lotta memories for me here.

335
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,375
[ZENKO'S DAD]
I have absolutely no intention

336
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,375
of letting you take
my place, young lady.

337
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,083
These weeds are
out of control.

338
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,000
Hang on! Those are daffodils!

339
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,541
[ZENKO]
These? Really?

340
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,041
Does that mean I shouldn'tve
been pulling them up?

341
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,250
[ASHIYA]
Stop what you're doing!

342
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,750
We're replanting them right now!

343
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,291
How could you do this?

344
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,791
Your hands'll get dirty.

345
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,625
Let me give you
one of my gloves.

346
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:37,833
It's okay. Really.

347
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,083
I'm used to it.

348
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,041
This soil is so dry.

349
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,875
We'll need to water
before we call it a day.

350
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,708
[ZENKO] You know
a lot about gardening.

351
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,708
Well, my mom is
a florist, after all.

352
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:53,000
You gonna go into that line
of work too one day, or what?

353
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,666
That was the plan
before things changed.

354
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,916
I'm the only son,
so I always assumed

355
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,875
it was my duty to carry
on the family business.

356
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,666
But then, mom told me
I didn't have to;

357
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,625
said she preferred I didn't.

358
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,666
She said running a flower shop
had been her dream, not mine.

359
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,041
That I should do what I want.

360
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,333
Crazy, huh?

361
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,166
My mom thinks it's better
for people to follow

362
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,625
what they're passionate about.

363
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,500
[ZENKO] Well, I actually
wanted to run the temple

364
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:20,833
when I got older,

365
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:24,000
but Dad made it clear that
he won't let it happen.

366
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,375
And I know it's not
because he cares

367
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,000
what my dreams are.

368
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,500
He's too old-fashioned.

369
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,333
Only sees that I'm a girl.

370
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,250
Zenko...

371
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,541
Are you sure that's his reason?

372
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,000
What else could it be?

373
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,541
He said he wouldn't leave
the temple to his daughter!

374
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,541
Seems pretty obvious
to me what he meant!

375
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,708
Uh, sorry! I didn't--

376
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,375
I just, um, thought maybe
he didn't want you to feel

377
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,791
an obligation to choose the
same path as him, that's all.

378
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,500
[ZENKO]
Could that be true?

379
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,958
Did it have nothing to do
with me being a girl?

380
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,500
[ASHIYA]
To be perfectly honest,

381
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,125
I was relieved when Mom said
I didn't have to be a florist,

382
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,625
ya know?

383
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,750
Basically meant I could choose
whatever path I wanted to.

384
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,875
[ZENKO]
Whatever path I wanted.

385
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,625
So Dad just--

386
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,833
He didn't want me to feel
pressured into following

387
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,541
in his footsteps.

388
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,208
I think all that yard work
might've actually

389
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,583
done the trick.

390
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,458
I ought to be able to cry now.

391
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,125
Uh, what did I say?

392
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:28,875
I don't know.

393
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:29,916
Are you okay?

394
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,375
Why are you crying?

395
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,541
What's wrong?

396
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,625
[ZENKO]
Why am I crying?

397
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,958
'Cause I'm happy? No.

398
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,541
'Cause I'm sad? No.

399
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,750
'Cause I'm mad at myself
for not giving Dad

400
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,083
the benefit of the doubt.

401
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:51,625
[crying]

402
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,750
[ASHIYA]
No, no, no!

403
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,333
Whatever I said, I'm sorry!

404
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,458
I take it back!
I didn't mean it!

405
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,500
[ZENKO'S DAD laughing]
Zenko...

406
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:09,125
[ZENKO'S DAD]
Why is my little girl crying?!

407
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,916
[groaning]

408
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,583
[ZENKO]
Daddy!

409
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,875
[ASHIYA]
That's the laughing mask!

410
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:23,083
Of course!
He saw Zenko's tears!

411
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,250
[ZENKO]
Help him!

412
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,541
[ASHIYA]
Okay...

413
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,666
What'd you do?

414
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:36,958
Huh...

415
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,000
I got it!

416
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,083
[ZENKO]
Got what?

417
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,666
I stopped laughing.

418
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,250
Score!

419
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,166
Now all I have to do is
give it back to the <i>yokai</i> !

420
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,333
I asked you a question, you
little pencil-necked candy ass!

421
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,541
Why was she crying?

422
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,625
Wait!

423
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,208
It's not what you think,
Father! I swear!

424
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,458
Father?

425
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,750
All right, that does it!

426
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,291
No, Dad! Don't hit him!

427
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,750
[ABENO] You'll have to
excuse my employee.

428
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,291
Please, sir, can you find it
in your heart to let this slide?

429
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,125
I'll put his feet
to the fire later.

430
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,250
Who the hell are you?

431
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,416
Abeno, what are you doing here?

432
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,958
I would've been better
off sending a five-year-old.

433
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,125
Moron.

434
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,666
We witnessed every
stage of this debacle.

435
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,833
[MITSUCHIGURA]
Many thanks.

436
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:18,916
[ASHIYA]
Really?

437
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,333
[ZENKO'S DAD] What were you
doing in my closet?

438
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,416
[ABENO]
Hey.

439
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:25,583
Let's go.

440
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,583
[ASHIYA]
Yes, sir!

441
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,666
Uh-oh. That can't
be a good look.

442
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,750
[ASHIYA] Let me just
grab my shoes first.

443
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,041
[ABENO] Relying on him is more
exhausting than doing it myself.

444
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:41,125
[ZENKO] Excuse me, but,
um, who are you guys?

445
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,416
[ABENO]
Who do you think?

446
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,375
Next time, maybe take
people at their word.

447
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:49,833
As farfetched as it may
seem, <i>yokai</i> really do exist.

448
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,583
When you're ready to believe,

449
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,791
I might just be persuaded to
tell you who we are one day.

450
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,541
Ready to go, sir!

451
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,750
[ABENO]
Finally.

452
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh, wait.
I need the book, and my bag.

453
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:02,875
[ABENO]
Hurry up.

454
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:03,958
[ASHIYA]
Right!

455
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:06,916
[ZENKO'S DAD]
Where are you going?

456
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,166
You can't live in my closet!

457
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,083
[ASHIYA]
Zenko.

458
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,500
Sorry I made you cry.

459
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,000
But you were great!

460
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,458
Thanks for all the help!

461
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,041
[ZENKO]
What did I do?

462
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,041
[ZENKO'S DAD]
You hear me?

463
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,333
Get out of there!

464
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,000
What? They disappeared.

465
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,375
[ZENKO]
Hey, Dad?

466
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,708
Can I ask you a question?

467
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:31,625
Do you secretly
wish I was a boy?

468
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,041
The hell would I?

469
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,125
[ZENKO]
Never mind.

470
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,625
[giggling]

471
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,625
[ZENKO]
<i>Yokai</i> , I'm not sure about,

472
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,333
but I definitely
believe in Hanae.

473
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,500
Hope he knows how grateful
I am for what he did.

474
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,958
[ZENKO] I'd sure like to
see him again someday.

475
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,083
[ZENKO'S DAD]
What?!

476
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,875
[MITSUCHIGURA] Payment for
services rendered, good sir.

477
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,833
[ABENO]
Very much appreciated.

478
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,291
Mononokean.
Our guest is leaving.

479
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,875
[bell rings]

480
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,958
[ASHIYA]
"Opening." What's that say?

481
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,083
[ABENO]
"Nijiriguchi." 

482
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,958
[ASHIYA]
Oh. That thing.

483
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,750
[ABENO]
Go on. Open it.

484
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,125
Uh, sure!

485
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,958
My legs fell asleep.

486
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:20,583
[MITSUCHIGURA] I'd never tire of
observing your behavior, Ashiya.

487
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,083
[ABENO]
I've had my fill.

488
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,666
[MITSUCHIGURA]
And yet, curiously,

489
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,166
I note that your expression
appears to have softened

490
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,291
since last we met.

491
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,458
My jaw's just
weary of clenching.

492
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,250
Honestly, I've been
a study in tension

493
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,833
from the moment he showed up.

494
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:37,000
[MITSUCHIGURA] Change for the
better is often nerve-wracking.

495
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,375
I feel certain Ashiya
will prove himself

496
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:40,708
a diligent worker.

497
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,125
[ABENO]
Let's hope so.

498
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,416
Don't fall in.

499
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,041
That's the Underworld.

500
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,541
No kidding?

501
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,666
[MITSUCHIGURA] Human beings
such as him are invaluable.

502
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,958
All the more reason
to proceed with caution.

503
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,541
Ashiya is dangerous.

504
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,458
Don't I know it.

505
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,250
I'll keep your words in mind.

506
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,625
[ASHIYA]
Hey, Abeno?

507
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,708
I've been meaning
to ask for a while,

508
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,666
and I guess now's
as good a time as any.

509
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,708
[ABENO]
What?

510
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,125
[ASHIYA]
Well...

511
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:45,041
Exactly when did the Mononokean
learn to use emoticons?

512
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,083
[ABENO]
Shut up.
