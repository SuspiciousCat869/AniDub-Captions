1
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:12,875
[YAHIKO]
This is so fun!

2
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:14,166
Let's play some more!

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,500
We can just keep on
playing all day and night!

4
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,583
Right, Haruitsuki?

5
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,666
Hey, Yahiko.

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,958
Yeah? What is it?

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,791
[ABENO] Wouldn't you rather go
to the Underworld instead?

8
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,375
There would be a whole lot
more people to play with there.

9
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:33,916
You'd be happier.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,083
You could play as
much as you wanted.

11
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,916
[YAHIKO] Are you saying that
you want me to go away?

12
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,208
Well?

13
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,666
Do you not want to
play with me anymore?

14
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,125
I still do.

15
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:02,625
That's great!

16
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:05,583
Then let's keep on playing
and playing forever!

17
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,125
We'll play hide and seek!

18
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,541
Is it true that you wanted
to succeed Aoi so badly...

19
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,375
...you killed for the job?

20
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,833
Hey. Zenko.

21
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,000
Are you okay?

22
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,666
[ASHIYA]
This is a lot like how I felt

23
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,458
when I was being possessed.

24
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:58,125
[YAHIKO] You didn't want
to be the servant anymore.

25
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,458
No. You wanted to be
the master of it all.

26
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:05,125
You wanted the fear
and respect of the <i>yokai</i> .

27
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,666
And you wanted all the
money that came with it.

28
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,041
[ABENO]
Are you jealous?

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,291
[ABENO]
It's true.

30
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,166
The master of the Mononokean
isn't like anyone else.

31
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,083
And there are a lot of <i>yokai</i>
who would give anything

32
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,083
to have the status and power
that this position holds.

33
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,541
Sure.

34
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,333
But if you ask me,
as far as I'm concerned,

35
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,541
those things are
more of a burden.

36
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,833
Besides.

37
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:36,125
I killed Aoi to become
the new master, right?

38
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,958
To satisfy my greed.

39
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,166
[ABENO] So that's
what they say about me.

40
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,083
[YAHIKO grunts]

41
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:53,250
If Aoi had ever heard
a rumor like that one,

42
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,625
they'd have died
from laughter instead.

43
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,291
Listen to me.

44
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,875
I didn't kill the old master.

45
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:01,958
Got it?

46
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,833
I wouldn't have ever
wished for them to go away.

47
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,000
Never for a damned second.

48
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,750
Zenko! Thank goodness!

49
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,166
You're back. And you're alive!

50
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,833
I am. Was I dead?

51
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,708
[ASHIYA]
Uh... You're alive now!

52
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,791
Haruitsuki. You know...

53
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,333
When I first started
hearing those rumors,

54
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,125
I didn't really believe
that they were true.

55
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,958
Not until I saw you again.

56
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,125
Oh, yeah?

57
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,250
Well, you had just
gotten so much taller,

58
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,208
and you were way more mature
than you were the last time.

59
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,416
It looked like you'd become a
different person altogether.

60
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,958
I wasn't sure if
you were still you.

61
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,458
So I felt like I had to make
completely sure for myself.

62
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,916
But after playing around
with you again today,

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,333
I found out you're the same
Haruitsuki I knew back then.

64
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,666
There's no doubt about it.

65
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,000
All those rumors aren't true.

66
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,166
Okay.

67
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,750
But what did you
plan on doing to me

68
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,208
if you found out
that they were true?

69
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,291
Huh...

70
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,291
I guess it would
depend on how I felt.

71
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,125
[ASHIYA]
Zenko, can you stand up?

72
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes.

73
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,750
And what about your left arm?

74
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:17,791
Does it still hurt?

75
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:18,833
[ZENKO]
Mm-hmm.

76
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,291
Yahiko.

77
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,708
Yes? What?

78
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,333
[ABENO] Over the years,
I've gotten used to dealing

79
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,000
with <i>yokai</i> like you.

80
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,375
So I'll get over this
pretty quickly.

81
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,333
But I'm weird like that.

82
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,708
What do you mean?

83
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,500
[ABENO]
She won't.

84
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,916
You're gonna remove
that thing from her arm.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,791
But it'll take a hell
of a lot more than that

86
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,041
to make it up to her.

87
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,333
Oh, wow. It disappeared.

88
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,541
Just gone.

89
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,958
Not even a trace.

90
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,375
That's great!

91
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,000
Go on.

92
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,416
[YAHIKO]
Yes. Okay.

93
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,875
I'm doing it.

94
00:05:55,958 --> 00:06:00,083
[YAHIKO]
Uh... Miss? Miss Zenko.

95
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,458
I'm very sorry for all
the trouble I put you through,

96
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:07,041
and for the bite and stuff,
and I take full responsibility.

97
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:10,250
I'll never do
anything like it again.

98
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,166
Not to you, or to anybody else.

99
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,875
[YAHIKO] If it would
make you feel any better,

100
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,958
you can uh...

101
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,416
Boil me in a pot. Uh...

102
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,875
It's "roast me alive
or whatever you please!"

103
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,333
So start the whole thing over.

104
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,250
Please don't. It's okay.

105
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,791
She said that
everything is okay again!

106
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,458
You weren't sincere at all.

107
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,583
Do it over!

108
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,500
You sure are scarier
than you used to be.

109
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,291
I'm very sorry...

110
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,666
No, that's enough.

111
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,791
You don't have to apologize.

112
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,916
But I would appreciate a favor.

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,458
What is it?

114
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,625
For one month,

115
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,500
I'll need you to help
around the temple.

116
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,291
I'd help you take care of it?

117
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,208
[ZENKO]
Mm-hmm.

118
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,833
Hold on a sec, Zenko!

119
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,625
Do you really want Yahiko to
hang around for that long?

120
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,166
Yeah. Can I not?

121
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,166
Well, uh...

122
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,416
It's not really
that you "can't."

123
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,541
Yahiko.

124
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,666
Yeah?

125
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,666
Do you remember eight years ago?

126
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,666
I told you the
Underworld has more people

127
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,916
for you to play with.

128
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,375
Consider that.

129
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,875
And tell me what you wanna do.

130
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,916
[YAHIKO] Are you saying that
you want me to go away?

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,208
You're probably mad
that I doubted you.

132
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,958
So, do you not want
to play anymore?

133
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,458
I'll play longer.

134
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,416
That's great to hear!

135
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,833
In that case, instead of
going to the Underworld.

136
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,166
I'll help around the
temple for a whole year!

137
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,416
Whoa! Is that
even allowed, Abeno?

138
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,416
I'd only said a month, but can
he really stay an entire year?

139
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,625
[ABENO]
Just behave yourself.

140
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:50,750
[YAHIKO]
I will!

141
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,375
[ASHIYA sighs] Well, that was
interesting and everything,

142
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,333
but I'm glad it's over.

143
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,625
Hey. This is
where I met Fuzzy.

144
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,666
It was right in this
very same spot.

145
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,666
What the--?

146
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,083
A bird?

147
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,375
No. Doesn't look right.

148
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,583
Is it real?

149
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,750
[ASHIYA] Wait.
This is way too familiar.

150
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:16,875
Same spot.

151
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,708
Weird looking thing
on the ground.

152
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,708
[ASHIYA]
I knew it!

153
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:24,750
Hang on.

154
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,625
You made eye contact.

155
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,000
So you can see me.

156
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,000
[ASHIYA]
I stepped on another <i>yokai</i> ?

157
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,416
Hey, you!

158
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,833
[ASHIYA gasps]

159
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,291
Tell me.

160
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,500
Do you happen to know where
I can find the Mononokean?

161
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,583
[ASHIYA]
Huh?

162
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,041
The princess and I
need to go there!

163
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,958
[ASHIYA]
He's looking for the Mononokean?

164
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,416
We need to be
exorcised or we...

165
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,875
Hey, are you okay?

166
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,416
I... need... water.

167
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,583
Princess!

168
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,458
[ASHIYA gasps]
I'm awake! I'm awake!

169
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,500
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,833
I guess I dozed off.

171
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,875
[JOMATSU]
Hold on. Where am I?

172
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,416
[gasps]

173
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
A human?

174
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,208
Why did you bring me here?

175
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,333
Did you forget?

176
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,625
I picked you up
after you'd collapsed.

177
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:14,708
You're human.

178
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,208
But you can still
see and hear me!

179
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,041
Just who are you, anyway?

180
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,166
My name's Ashiya,
and I work part-time

181
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,333
for the Mononokean.

182
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,041
Wait, you actually
work for the Mononokean?

183
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,166
I need your help!

184
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,333
You gotta take me
there right now!

185
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,125
Please. Water.

186
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,500
[ASHIYA]
Is tea okay?

187
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,708
[JOMATSU]
Oh, yeah! Some more?

188
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,791
You must be really thirsty.

189
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,750
That's like your
fifth cup of tea.

190
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,708
I nearly died out there today.

191
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,000
But what an incredible
stroke of luck to be saved

192
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,000
by a real employee
of the Mononokean.

193
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,166
My name's Jomatsu, by the way.

194
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,416
Right before you lost
consciousness earlier,

195
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,833
you had mentioned something
about a princess.

196
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,833
I was referring to Princess
Anmo, the fairest of all.

197
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,041
Is that so?

198
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,458
Her beauty is beyond compare.

199
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,916
Long before I began to serve
her, many other <i>yokai</i> adored her

200
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,875
and dubbed her a princess.

201
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,208
But...

202
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,458
Her only flaw is she
falls in love too easily.

203
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:17,000
And always with those who
dwell in the mundane world.

204
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,708
She's been beguiled
by five humans,

205
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,875
fallen for fifteen birds,
seduced by four bears,

206
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,416
three tanuki,
two flying squirrels,

207
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,916
and too many cats
and dogs to count.

208
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,666
And pined away for a jet.

209
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,416
She's not very picky.

210
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,541
It does sound like she
falls in love very easily.

211
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,833
The worst part about
it is the aftermath.

212
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,625
Since creatures of the
mundane world can't see her,

213
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,958
the love is
tragically unrequited.

214
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:43,291
She's constantly
getting her heart broken.

215
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:46,083
And each time she feels
those pangs of torment,

216
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,041
she encloses herself
in an egg-shaped shell

217
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,958
and wallows in her solitude.

218
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,833
She hides inside an egg?

219
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,208
[JOMATSU]
Yes.

220
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:56,375
Normally she emerges after
a few days spent inside.

221
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,666
But it has been over
a month this time!

222
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,125
And what's more,

223
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,791
the shell continues to
grow larger by the day!

224
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,333
It's growing?

225
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,000
[JOMATSU] I just don't have
the strength to move it around

226
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,708
by myself anymore.

227
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,166
I'm completely useless to her!

228
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,541
[crying]

229
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,583
Please, Ashiya!

230
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,083
You must take me
to the Mononokean!

231
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,750
I'm sorry, but I'm actually
not able to just go there.

232
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:21,958
And why's that?

233
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,458
Well, Abeno.

234
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,541
The master of the Mononokean
has to summon it somewhere.

235
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,583
I can probably get
in touch with him.

236
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,208
But you should take
it easy for the night.

237
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,166
Very well.

238
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,500
But you must contact
him immediately!

239
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,791
This instant!

240
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,375
[ASHIYA] I wonder if
he'll pick up his phone.

241
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,750
[JOMATSU]
Keep calling him!

242
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,416
[ASHIYA]
I can't make him answer.

243
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:45,916
Hey.

244
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,958
You know you've got
something on your head?

245
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,208
Yeah, and I must've called
you like a million times

246
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,750
about it last night.

247
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,083
Why didn't you answer?

248
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,208
Are you the Master
of the Mononokean?

249
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,041
Yes. And who are you?

250
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,500
I'm Jomatsu.

251
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,333
He's been looking for you
so you can exorcise him.

252
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,458
If you can wait until I'm
finished with today's job,

253
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,833
I can help you out.

254
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:06,708
Or next week?

255
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:07,916
I can't wait that long!

256
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,291
We have a job today?

257
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,000
It's just a consultation
with a new client.

258
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,791
I don't think it'll go too late.

259
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,208
I'll be done by evening.

260
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,833
[ASHIYA]
He's working on our next job?

261
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,083
I see.

262
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,791
Evening, you say.

263
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,708
My poor princess.

264
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,083
[ASHIYA]
Oh, hey, Jomatsu.

265
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,291
What do you think of this?

266
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,791
We go over to where
Princess Anmo is,

267
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,958
and wait by her side
until he shows up.

268
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,125
Yeah! That's a great idea!

269
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,458
Let's go!

270
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,375
[ABENO]
Ashiya.

271
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,541
[ASHIYA]
Eh?

272
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,041
Are you sure?

273
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,625
You can handle that alone?

274
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:42,083
[ASHIYA]
He definitely isn't into it.

275
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,708
Let's get moving!

276
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,375
We're coming, Princess!

277
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,666
[ASHIYA]
Hold on, Jomatsu!

278
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,333
I can't fly! Come back!

279
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,375
Aww...

280
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,458
So... What should I do?

281
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,166
He's gone.

282
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,458
[ABENO]
It's not my problem.

283
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:58,625
Figure it out.

284
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,708
[ASHIYA panting]

285
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:06,833
[ASHIYA]
Jomatsu!

286
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:07,916
Wait up!

287
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,500
[JOMATSU]
You're way too slow!

288
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,333
I can't help you and
the princess if you keep

289
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,583
flying away!

290
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,541
[JOMATSU]
You can if you hurry!

291
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,250
[ASHIYA]
Give me a break!

292
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,625
If she hears that we
can go to the Underworld,

293
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,666
that might give the
princess enough initiative

294
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,583
to finally come
out of her shell.

295
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,000
It seems like an eternity
since I've seen her.

296
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,750
[ASHIYA] So he's been
waiting on her for a month,

297
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,541
but can't give me five minutes?

298
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,083
[ASHIYA coughs]

299
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,541
What? Something wrong?

300
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,375
No, it's fine!
Nothing to worry about!

301
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,541
[JOMATSU sighs]

302
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,416
Didn't sound like
things are fine.

303
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,583
What is it?

304
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,541
I really wasn't going
to ask, but uh...

305
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,083
Well, out with it!

306
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,541
Okay, the only thing is

307
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,208
that it's kind of a
personal question.

308
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,250
Are you in love
with the princess?

309
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,125
A very personal question!

310
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,333
And totally off base,
I might add!

311
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,708
I'm merely concerned
about her well-being.

312
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:58,791
I understand.

313
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,625
Must've gotten the wrong idea.

314
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,333
[JOMATSU]
Let's go!

315
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,791
[ASHIYA]
He's crazy for her.

316
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:09,833
[JOMATSU]
Princess! Princess! Princess!

317
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,291
That's strange.

318
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,416
I could've sworn that I left
her right under this tree.

319
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,875
What does the egg look like?

320
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,375
[JOMATSU] It's a little
bit bigger than me,

321
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,791
and completely
covered in stripes.

322
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,916
That means I gotta be careful.

323
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,750
I'd hate to step
on it and--[grunts]

324
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,791
No! Didn't hurt at all!

325
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,541
[JOMATSU]
Now what did you do to yourself?

326
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,458
My shin.
I hit it on a rock.

327
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,416
[JOMATSU]
A rock?

328
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,666
Are you positive?

329
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,208
[ASHIYA]
Could this be her egg?

330
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,458
[JOMATSU gasps]

331
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,916
Yes! This is it!

332
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,583
But the fact that it's grown so
much larger since the last time

333
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,791
I saw it completely
boggles my mind.

334
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:47,708
No kidding.

335
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:48,875
The thing's gigantic!

336
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:49,833
[JOMATSU]
Princess!

337
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,125
I've come to your aid!

338
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,541
I was able to locate
the Mononokean!

339
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,791
We can go to the Underworld!

340
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,041
Can she hear me?

341
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,166
In any case,
she's not coming out.

342
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,208
But I'm pretty sure the egg
will fit through the portal

343
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,416
to the Underworld, at least.

344
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,875
[ASHIYA grunts]

345
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,541
That is really heavy.

346
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,958
Man. It's gonna
be a real problem

347
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,958
trying to get it anywhere
with just us.

348
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,333
I'm afraid so.

349
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,625
Hold on.

350
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,041
Hey, Jomatsu?

351
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,041
Huh?

352
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,333
What do you say
we break it open?

353
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,458
Break it?

354
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,708
Well, the shell is
just crumbling away

355
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,250
like it's made out of sand.

356
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,541
So if we hit it with a rock,
we could get through it.

357
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,708
No, that would be
way too dangerous!

358
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:32,958
Oh, really?

359
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,250
Would it release some
poison gas or something?

360
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,458
I simply cannot risk
a shard breaking off

361
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,041
and hurting the princess!

362
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,208
Besides, she might come out
and peck us if we do that.

363
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,166
[ASHIYA] This guy's
speaking from experience.

364
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,791
Princess, I won't
let this guy hurt you!

365
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,416
I swore to protect
you with my life

366
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,916
if that's what I have to do.

367
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Hey, can she hear us?

368
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,458
I mean, you've been
in this situation before.

369
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,958
So what happened then?

370
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,458
Let's see.

371
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,458
Well, in the past, sometimes
the princess would answer me

372
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,666
through the shell.

373
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,666
Then that should make
things really easy.

374
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,541
Um, hello?

375
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,333
I'm sorry to bother
you, Princess.

376
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,250
But I work for the Mononokean.

377
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,166
I know this is
a difficult time,

378
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,750
but I can't send you
to the Underworld

379
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,666
while you're inside your egg.

380
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,208
So if you could come out,
that would help us out a lot.

381
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,041
[knocking]

382
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,750
Hey, can you hear me
in there, Princess?

383
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,000
[JOMATSU] You're gonna break
it if you're not careful!

384
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,000
I think she's ignoring me.

385
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,083
[JOMATSU]
I suppose it can't be helped.

386
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,000
I'll just have to give up
going to the Underworld

387
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,125
and wait for her to
come out when she's ready.

388
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,416
Are you sure?

389
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,458
[JOMATSU]
Yes.

390
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,333
[ASHIYA] I know it's
not what you want.

391
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,166
But...

392
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,291
Ashiya, wait a sec.

393
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,208
[ASHIYA]
It's the only option we have.

394
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,583
No, don't!

395
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,791
This just means that you
won't have to wait for her.

396
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,333
[JOMATSU]
What?!

397
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,708
That is completely out of the
question! I won't allow it!

398
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,583
You can't keep letting her
get away with this behavior!

399
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,708
Sometimes you just have
to be cruel to be kind!

400
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:02,875
[JOMATSU]
What's gotten into you?

401
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:03,916
Put that down!

402
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,333
[ASHIYA]
Get out of the way, Jomatsu!

403
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,750
I don't want you getting hurt!

404
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:07,958
[JOMATSU]
Don't be ridiculous!

405
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,541
I said it's too dangerous!

406
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,833
[ASHIYA] Unless we do something
now, this is never gonna end!

407
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,583
[JOMATSU]
I can wait as long as I have to!

408
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,833
[ASHIYA]
Well, I have a job to do,

409
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,666
and it's not just
you I have to please!

410
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,375
I can't make Abeno angry again!

411
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,666
[JOMATSU]
If you hurt the princess,

412
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,458
you're gonna make me angry,
and I'll hurt you!

413
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,791
[ASHIYA]
Get out of the way, Jomatsu!

Hello, there.

Nice to meet you, Princess.

Jomatsu's fine. So don't worry.

[PRINCESS ANMO chirps]

426
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,833
Did she really just go back in?

427
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,458
[JOMATSU]
Are you kidding me?!

428
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,083
You mean you went
through that whole routine

429
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,375
with your horrible acting

430
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,458
because you thought
you could trick her?

431
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,916
[ASHIYA]
I knew it was risky.

432
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,166
But I didn't want you to
have to wait any longer.

433
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,291
Princess Amno?

434
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,000
I know you can hear me.

435
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,250
Please listen.

436
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,708
You came out because
you were worried

437
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,333
about Jomatsu, right?

438
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,125
Honestly, I'm
worried about him too.

439
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,625
He works so hard.

440
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,958
I didn't want him to collapse
on the sidewalk again.

441
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,791
Slow down!
Don't tell lies about me!

442
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,125
I don't want the princess
getting the wrong idea.

443

[PRINCESS ANMO chirping]

444
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,250
Well, uh...

445
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,541
The princess. What did she say?

446
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,666
She asked me,

447
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,458
"Did you truly push yourself
to the brink over me? Why?"

448
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,958
[ASHIYA]
Because you love her, obviously.

449
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,333
This is it.

450
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,875
Your chance to tell her
how you feel about her.

451
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,041
[JOMATSU gasps]

452
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,833
My chance? That's absurd!

453
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,125
And how would that be?

454
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,666
Don't play dumb.

455
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,291
You're gonna blow it if
you act like you don't care.

456
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,083
The whole reason she asked you

457
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,666
is because she thinks she
already knows the answer.

458
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,666
So tell her.

459
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,875
[JOMATSU]
You think so?

460

[PRINCESS ANMO chirps]

461
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:15,125
Princess, I...
It's all because...

462
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:18,208
Well... I did it because...

463
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,583
Honestly...

464
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:23,000
Because... I love it.

465
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,500
I love flying through
the sky with you

466
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,750
more than anything.

467
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,250
It's what makes every
single day worth living!

468
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,916
[JOMATSU] The joy that I
feel when we're in the air...

469
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,083
It's worth it!

470
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,166
That's what makes
the wait bearable!

471
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,458
So even after we
go to the Underworld,

472
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,333
all I want more than anything
that I've ever wanted

473
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,583
is just the chance
to be by your side.

00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,208
My dear princess.

475
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,791
Forever might not
be long enough for me!

Oh...!

didn't hold back on that one!

483
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,708
[PRINCESS ANMO chirping]

484
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,833
Oh. Is that true?

485
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,666
I had no idea you
felt the same way!

486
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,208
[ASHIYA]
Steam?

487
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,583
Hey... Ashiya,
if you can... Water.

488
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:20,916
Please, more water.

489
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,875
All I have is Oolong tea.

490
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:23,958
[ABENO]
Ashiya.

491
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,916
[ASHIYA]
Whoa! You're here already?

492
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,041
If you want me to leave,
that can easily be arranged.

493
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,291
No! This is perfect timing!

494
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,083
[ABENO]
There's another one?

495
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,208
I'd like you to
meet Princess Anmo.

496
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,041
So she was inside the egg?

497
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,416
We were finally able to
convince her to come out.

498
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,958
All that's left is to send
them to the Underworld.

499
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,333
[ABENO] That's the smug look of
a guy who finally figured out

500
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:50,000
how to solve a
problem by himself.

501
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,208
You fool.

502
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,583
[ASHIYA]
Huh?

503
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:53,791
[PRINCESS ANMO chirps]

504
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:56,958
Princess?

505
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:05,500
[PRINCESS ANMO chirping]

506
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,500
[ASHIYA] She looks way
too happy up there.

507
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,000
What's going on here?

508
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,791
Didn't you and the princess just
confess your undying love

509
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,500
for one another?

510
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,875
Well...

511
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,666
Specifically, what she told
me was that she loved

512
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,458
flying with me more
than anything else, too.

513
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,750
Yeah?

514
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,500
[JOMATSU] She also said
she'd try not to hide

515
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,250
in her shell anymore.

516
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,083
That wasn't actually
the issue here!

517
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,666
Do neither of you get it?

518
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,250
This was about more
than flying together!

519
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,166
Come on!

520
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,458
So... what's wrong?

521
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,791
Don't act like you
don't know what's going on!

522
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,625
You're caught up in this
bizarre love triangle now, too!

523
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,125
I've only been here a
couple of minutes, ya know.

524
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,041
I was trying to get
them an Underworld

525
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,291
honeymoon and storybook ending!

526
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,583
And then you showed up
at the absolute worst time!

527
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:50,666
[ABENO]
What?!

528
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,708
[ABENO] Everything about
today totally sucks.

529
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,000
This stupid job.

530
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:00,208
And the next one
is gonna be even worse.

531
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,041
[ASHIYA]
He's so loud and childish.

532
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,750
And I thought he was honest,
but it's more like precocious.

533
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,625
[ABENO]
What is it now?

534
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,333
Reflecting on your own flaws?

535
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:41,625
[ASHIYA]
It's not me!

536
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,125
I'm talking about Yahiko!

537
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,541
[ABENO] Well, I couldn't
tell the difference.

538
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,000
[ASHIYA]
What do you mean by that?
