1
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:09,125
[SHIZUKU]
Okay, if it's not there,

2
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:11,916
it should definitely
be over here.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,166
[ABENO]
You didn't throw it away?

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,500
[SHIZUKU]
No!

5
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:17,000
C'mon, an inventory list?
Not in a million years!

6
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,041
Probably.

7
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,041
Probably?

8
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,500
If I end up losing
one of Koura's

9
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,083
precious inventory lists,

10
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,250
who knows what she's
gonna do to punish me!

11
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:27,250
I bet I'll end up getting
mixed in with the ingredients!

12
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:30,083
Don't worry.
It'll turn up eventually.

13
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,291
Uh... Wait.

14
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,958
Something jog your memory?

15
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:34,916
Oh, uh...

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,916
No, but did Ashiya go somewhere?

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,208
He was just in here
a minute ago.

18
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,125
Shizuku, dear?

19
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,291
[SHIZUKU]
Yes, ma'am?

20
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,333
I believe that you're
looking for this?

21
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,500
[SHIZUKU]
Oh, thank goodness!

22
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,625
It was hiding in the kitchen.

23
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:50,625
Itsuki?

24
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,291
Something the matter?

25
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:55,583
[ABENO] Forgive me, but I
can't leave the five-year-old

26
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,125
to his own devices.

27
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,708
[SHIZUKU]
Aw, you're taking off?

28
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,000
Sorry, shouldn't be too long.

29
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,458
Ashiya's an idiot.

30
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,583
Wait, seriously?

31
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:39,875
But, Fuzzy...

32
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,541
What are you even doing here?

33
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,541
[CAPY]
Damn vermin.

34
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,291
You in cahoots with this thief?

35
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,750
He's got absolutely
nothing to do with this!

36
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,500
[CAPY] Well, 'less he wants
to see his buddy get hurt,

37
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:53,875
he'd best behave.

38
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,000
You're on thin ice as it is.

39
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,000
[ASHIYA]
It's okay. I'll be fine.

40
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,500
Go. Run!

41
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,125
[CAPY growling]

42
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,500
Fuzzy! No!

43
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,916
[CAPY]
Ugh! Get off of me!

44
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:13,875
[ASHIYA]
Fuzzy!

45
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,666
[CAPY]
Stay right there, ya punk!

46
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,083
[ASHIYA]
Stop it! Let go!

47
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,625
[CAPY] Hardly seems worth
the trouble now, huh?

48
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:31,708
[ASHIYA]
No.

49
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,166
[CAPY]
What the--?

50
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,625
What are you doing?

51
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,625
[ASHIYA]
It's not.

52
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,625
I understand why you're upset.

53
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,458
But you ignored me.

54
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,833
Nothing I had
to say got through.

55
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:52,041
All you did was run your big
fat mouth without listening.

56
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,333
You even had the nerve
to pull a knife on me.

57
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,958
You took your anger
out on someone

58
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,000
who was trying to help.

59
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,541
Your actions were indefensible.

60
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,958
You realize that, surely.

61
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,458
[ASHIYA yells]

62
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:15,625
[ABENO]
A... shi... ya....

63
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:17,750
Uh-oh.

64
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,541
Um, hey there, Abeno.

65
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:20,791
Imbecile.

66
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,041
You wandered from the
shop without my leave.

67
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,375
What's going on?

68
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,833
Better yet, what the hell
have you gotten into?

69
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:27,875
Well, I--!

70
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,708
[ASHIYA]
He's really scary right now.

71
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:30,916
I'm a dead man.

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,291
[ABENO] Ah, perhaps
you imagined I'd smile

73
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,500
and greet you with open arms;
chalk it down to inexperience?

74
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,791
Am I a babysitter?

75
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,916
[CAPY] Wait, what was he
babbling about earlier?

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,500
Something about working for
the Mononokean, right?

77
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,375
If that's true, then...

78
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,958
Oh, no!

79
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,583
This angry guy must be...

80
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,125
Calm down, Itsuki!

81
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,666
You can't just start a fight
in the middle of the street

82
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,333
like some kinda thug; you're
the master of the Mononokean!

83
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,208
[ABENO]
Back off!

84
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,500
Let go of me, Shizuku!

85
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,958
Wait, did...

86
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,166
Did she just call him the
"master of the Mononokean?"

87
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,666
I think so, yeah.

88
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,458
What the heck is going on?

89
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,166
Why are you talking
to this <i>yokai</i> ?

90
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,625
And why the hell is
he on the ground?

91
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,125
You've got the wrong idea!
I'm the victim here!

92
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,666
Fuzzy! He's been hurt!

93
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,833
Hey! Don't walk
away from me!

94
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,041
[ASHIYA]
It's okay.

95
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,416
Don't try to move.

96
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,583
Let me see.

97
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,416
That's the <i>yokai</i>
from the other day.

98
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,625
Looks like he's been
hurt pretty badly.

99
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,750
What exactly went down here?

100
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,875
[CAPY]
Uh... Nothing!

101
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,208
It was--!

102
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,125
Can you stand up?

103
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,333
Please, sir.

104
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,916
Whatever mischief my
employee's gotten into

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,083
at your expense,
let me put it right.

106
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,208
Hey!

107
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,333
I didn't do anything wrong!

108
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,083
You're a child!
Shut your mouth!

109
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,125
[CAPY]
Uh, are...

110
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,625
Are you really who
they say you are?

111
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,666
The rumored second master?

112
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,791
Yes.

113
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,583
[CAPY]
I don't believe it!

114
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,500
The man who killed
his predecessor,

115
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,875
standing right in front of me!

116
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,625
[ABENO]
A word of advice.

117
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:06,791
Take the rumors you hear
about me with a grain of salt.

118
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,416
I am simply the current master.

119
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,083
Now, then.

120
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,791
Since my employee
is directly involved

121
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,750
in whatever mishap's
befallen you, I'm responsible.

122
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,666
I'm sorry, but as
there's been violence,

123
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,958
I have to report this
to the authorities.

124
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:25,458
See, at the end of the day it's
a clear violation of the rules.

125
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:28,541
With any luck, you'll
get off with a fine, but...

126
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,583
[CAPY]
Wait!

127
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,208
I had nothing to do with this!

128
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,250
I'm just--

129
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,083
I'm just an innocent bystander!

130
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,666
Hey! What are you talking about?

131
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,416
--That's a lie!
--[CAPY] Terribly sorry!

132
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,000
I really must be going!

133
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,541
Whoa! Stop! Get back here!

134
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,458
Ashiya! It can wait!

135
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,875
Right now our priority is
getting back to the Kiyakudo

136
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,291
and treating him!

137
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,625
[ASHIYA]
Yeah, right.

138
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,208
[KOURA] They're certainly
taking their time, aren't they?

139
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,583
What's taking so long?

140
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,666
Surely they've found
Ashiya by now.

141
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,583
[phone ringing]

142
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,666
Huh? Oh, a tadpole line.

143
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,791
Koura here. To whom
am I speaking, please?

144
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,041
[LEGISLATOR]
So formal.

145
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,083
It's just me.

146
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,250
Oh, my! Legislator!

147
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,000
[LEGISLATOR chuckles]
C'mon. Don't do that.

148
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,958
Calling me by my
job title is so cold.

149
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,541
Makes me think you
have ulterior motives.

150
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,666
You know perfectly well
I always have ulterior motives.

151
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,458
The vocal cords
producing that voice

152
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,958
would make an absolutely
splendid medicine.

153
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,500
[LEGISLATOR] I'm sure they
would. Is Shizuku here?

154
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,500
Sorry. Not at
the moment, I'm afraid.

155
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,000
She's out with Itsuki.

156
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,541
[LEGISLATOR]
Itsuki?

157
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,791
He's in the Underworld
right now?

158
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,291
[KOURA] Good help is
so hard to find these days.

159
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,000
Literally in this case,
it seems.

160
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,541
His new whipping boy's
gone missing,

161
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,708
so they're out trying
to rein the lad in.

162
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,333
[LEGISLATOR]
Whipping boy?

163
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,500
What do you mean?

164
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,250
His new employee,
or have you not heard?

165
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,250
[LEGISLATOR]
Ah. I see.

166
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,666
Itsuki's supposed to run
all new hires by me first.

167
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,458
Seems our friend's not
a stickler for protocol.

168
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,500
Do me a favor.

169
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes, darling?

170
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,500
[LEGISLATOR] Would you mind
giving him a message for me?

171
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,333
It'd be my pleasure.

172
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,041
Go for it, love.

173
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,958
[LEGISLATOR] The new boy
has to meet with my approval.

174
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,416
That's the way it's always been,

175
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,041
that's the way
it always will be.

176
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,500
I have the final say.

177
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,541
And rules are rules.

178
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,000
Tell Itsuki to bring him
to me without delay.

179
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,083
Thank you.

180
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,291
[ABENO]
I can see your predicament.

181
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,333
Sorry.

182
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,333
It all just
happened so quickly.

183
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,375
[door opens]

184
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,250
Here we are.
All patched up now.

185
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,000
[ASHIYA]
Fuzzy!

186
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,666
So then, he's gonna
be all right, yeah?

187
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,041
Yeah! It's not nearly
as bad as it looks.

188
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,666
With a little rest he should
be as good as new in no time!

189
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,916
That's great news!

190
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,958
You two are a couple
of miracle workers!

191
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:00,833
Okay, then.

192
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,375
Well, I guess he just
let everybody know

193
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,333
who his favorite is.

194
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,208
Wow. He's such a love bug.

195
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,208
[ASHIYA]
Go on, Abeno.

196
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,583
You can pet him, too,
if you want.

197
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,708
That's not why I'm...!

198
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:13,875
Oh, forget it.

199
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,000
Does his contact not
affect you anymore?

200
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,125
[ASHIYA]
Whoa. I don't feel like crap!

201
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,333
Oh, my goodness.
I almost forgot.

202
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:26,041
The Legislator asked me to pass
on a message to you and Shizuku.

203
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,875
The Legislator?

204
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,625
Great. Just what I need.

205
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,250
[SHIZUKU] What does
my brother want this time?

206
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,333
Well, for you,
he says he misses you

207
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,333
and would like a
visit sometime soon.

208
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,000
That poor fellow's
very lonesome.

209
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,083
[SHIZUKU] I was just
over there yesterday!

210
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,333
[ASHIYA]
Okay.

211
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,916
[KOURA]
And for Itsuki...

212
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,916
He expects you to bring
your new employee by

213
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,916
for his approval
as soon as possible.

214
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,916
Something about rules.

215
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,458
He didn't seem too
happy about having to ask.

216
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,875
I wouldn't wait.

217
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,750
What?! You've gotta
be kidding, right?

218
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,625
He's the one who
made it legal for masters

219
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,916
to choose their employees
in the first place!

220
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,208
I'm sorry, darling.

221
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,833
But it's no use
complaining to me.

222
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,875
I just don't understand
why he would change his tune

223
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:08,875
all of a sudden.

224
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,333
Well, my dear.

225
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,416
I can't say for sure,

226
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,166
but perhaps it's
because you neglected

227
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,875
to tell him you hired someone.

228
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,833
He did seem rather sulky.

229
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,750
Course he did.

230
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:20,791
Fine.

231
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,791
We have no choice but to go.

232
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,166
[ASHIYA]
Go where, exactly?

233
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,958
Newt Lake. That's where
the Legislator dwells.

234
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,041
All righty, then. Who's he?

235
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,416
And should I be worried?

236
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,416
Worried? Come on!
We're talking about my brother!

237
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,416
[ABENO] He's my superior.
There, I said it.

238
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Seriously?

239
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,041
It's the way of things.

240
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,375
He's one of three
influential figures here.

241
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,208
They essentially
manage the Underworld.

242
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,125
[ASHIYA]
And we're going to see him?

243
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,250
Well that settles it.

244
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,541
What?

245
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,958
I'll give you the medicine
we've made thus far

246
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,916
so you don't go away
empty-handed.

247
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,083
That'd be great.

248
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,375
Oh, hey, and would
you mind throwing in

249
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,541
some of that healing
salve while you're at it?

250
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,041
What would you need it for?

251
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,833
To take care of the hairball.

252
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,041
[ASHIYA]
Really?

253
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,500
Does that mean we're
taking him back with us

254
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,833
to the Mononokean?

255
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,083
Of course.
Somebody has to look after him.

256
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,458
And by somebody,
naturally, I mean you.

257
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,416
[ASHIYA]
Don't worry! I'm all over it!

258
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,875
Aw.

259
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,291
[ABENO]
He really likes you.

260
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,666
Li'l guy must feel super safe
to fall asleep on you like that.

261
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,458
[KOURA]
Here's the medicine.

262
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,291
I'll have the rest made
the next time you visit.

263
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,250
Thank you again.

264
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,083
[ASHIYA] Whatever it is,
that stuff must be important.

265
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,333
Well, good luck
with the Legislator.

266
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,916
See you again real soon!

267
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,375
Sure!

268
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,000
Thanks a lot for
patching up Fuzzy.

269
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,625
[ABENO]
Aside from the Legislator,

270
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,041
there's the Justice
and the Executive.

271
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,958
They're the three big shots
I mentioned earlier.

272
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,625
True to his name, the Legislator
has the power to set rules.

273
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,791
Anyone who breaks
those rules is punished.

274
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,750
[ASHIYA]
Punished in the Underworld?

275
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,541
Sounds terrifying.

276
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,416
It is, or at least
I suppose it would be

277
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,791
if I weren't exempt.

278
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,875
According to the rules, the
master of the Mononokean

279
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,291
is permitted to
act independently.

280
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,625
[ASHIYA] Wait, so they
just let you run around

281
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,083
and do whatever you want?

282
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,333
How does that work?

283
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,208
[ABENO] Shut up,
I'm not a wild animal.

284
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,916
Besides, I'm not above the law.

285
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,958
There is one rule
I have to follow.

286
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,500
Wow. Just one?

287
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,958
[ABENO]
Yes.

288
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,500
"The master must obey any
rule directly imposed on him

289
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,333
by the Legislator."

290
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,291
If I run afoul of that,
I lose my job.

291
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,333
End of story.

292
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,083
[ASHIYA]
Makes sense, I guess.

293
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,250
[ASHIYA]
How much farther?

294
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,000
And shouldn't there be
a path or something?

295
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,750
We're just wading through grass!

296
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,916
How do you know
we're not totally lost?

297
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,125
Quit whining.

298
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,583
We're taking a shortcut.

299
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,750
Stop acting like a baby.

300
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,416
Newt Lake is just up ahead.

301
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,125
And that's where
the Legislator is, right?

302
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,541
You said something about
him "dwelling" there.

303
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,791
Yes.

304
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,958
So what kind of
<i>yokai</i> we dealing with?

305
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,166
He's not dangerous or anything?

306
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,000
[ABENO]
Hmm... Not exactly, no.

307
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,083
Then again, he gambles.
And he's a full-blown

308
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,333
unapologetically
alcoholic pervert.

309
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,250
So a real pillar of society.

310
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,000
Doesn't seem like the kinda guy
I'd want making the rules.

311
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,458
He loves his sister.

312
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,041
[ASHIYA]
Um, let me get this straight:

313
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,708
He's the guy who gets
to decide whether or not

314
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,750
I'm worthy of being
your employee?

315
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,416
[ABENO]
Unfortunately, yes.

316
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,250
[ASHIYA] If he fires me, I'm
gonna have to rethink my life.

317
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,291
[ABENO]
Do what?

318
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,583
Hey, perk up.

319
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,333
I'm not just gonna
let him fire you.

320
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,333
[ASHIYA]
So, like...

321
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,875
You being all mean
is just an act?

322
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,416
You actually like
having me around?

323
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,208
Slow down.
Don't read into things.

324
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,666
You have a debt to pay off.

325
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,083
[ASHIYA]
Oh. Right.

326
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We're here.

327
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,041
[ASHIYA]
Whoa.

328
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,666
This is Newt Lake?

329
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,375
So, you wanted to see me?

330
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,833
[LEGISLATOR]
Itsuki. Glad you could make it.

331
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,625
Finally. I assume this
boy is the new hire?

332
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:03,291
Well, it's my pleasure to
welcome you to Newt Lake.

333
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,416
[ASHIYA]
Not what I was expecting.

334
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,875
What's the matter, Fuzzy?

335
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,916
[LEGISLATOR] This is what I get
for putting my faith in you.

336
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,291
I realize vetting isn't easy.

337
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,291
But picking someone so weak?

338
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,666
For crying out loud,
one look is all you need.

339
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,666
Consider another line of work.

340
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,208
No offense, but you just
don't have what it takes.

341
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,375
Come on!

342
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,250
You can't just spout
off crap like that!

343
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,416
[LEGISLATOR]
He can't handle the job.

344
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,833
You expect me to candy-coat it?

345
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,833
Moot point either way.

346
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,875
Humans aren't suited
to the life.

347
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,000
[ASHIYA]
He knows I'm human?

348
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,000
[LEGISLATOR]
Am I wrong?

349
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,250
[ASHIYA]
I'm not what I look like!

350
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,791
I'm a <i>yokai</i> !
Really! Um, yeah.

351
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,583
A special humanoid <i>yokai</i> !

352
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,375
[ABENO]
Worst liar ever.

353
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,958
[ASHIYA]
Back me up, please!

354
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,333
Whatever. Fine.

355
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,375
He's a human being.
Are you happy?

356
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,541
What's the deal, Abeno?!

357
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,375
I thought we weren't
supposed to give it away!

358
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,666
Do they know
you're human, too?

359
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,000
Should we let them in
on that little secret?

360
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,208
Keep it down, moron!

361
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,333
[ASHIYA]
I know what this is!

362
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,833
You're abandoning me
to save yourself!

363
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,083
[ABENO]
Will you please shut up?

364
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,541
You're throwing
me under the bus!

365
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:20,750
I'm not an idiot!

366
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,541
Jerk face! Traitor!

367
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,583
Con artist! Petty tyrant!

368
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,750
Knock it off!

369
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,291
One more word out
of you and that's it!

370
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,541
[laughing]

371
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,791
Besties, huh?

372
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,166
[ASHIYA, ABENO]
Stay out of this!

373
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:41,166
Your name wouldn't be
Ashiya, by any chance?

374
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,666
Um... Yes, it is.

375
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,125
[ASHIYA]
Wait...

376
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,000
Why is this familiar?

377
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,250
Just so you know,

378
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,083
I had my own reasons
for hiring him.

379
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,166
And besides, you think
I'd take someone on

380
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,875
who couldn't handle it?

381
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:59,458
If I didn't have full confidence
in him, he wouldn't be here.

382
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,750
[ASHIYA]
Confidence?

383
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,208
Does he really mean that?

384
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,583
Sure, he's a failure
who makes my job harder

385
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,500
more often than not,
and he's supremely irritating.

386
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,541
[ASHIYA]
Thanks for lifting me up.

387
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,958
And if you make a rule
saying I have to fire him,

388
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,666
I won't disobey protocol.

389
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,875
I'm not the type of guy
who likes to rock the boat.

390
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,791
That being said, however...

391
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,916
As long as it's not
an official rule,

392
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,708
then I'm not going to fire him.

393
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,291
Well... Itsuki
has spoken his mind.

394
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,750
What's your opinion
on the matter?

395
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,625
Can a human being do the job?

396
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,875
Can you give yourself
mind, body, and soul

397
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,500
to the service of <i>yokai</i> ?

398
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,083
[ASHIYA]
Mind, body, and soul?

399
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,416
Seems like kind of a tall order.

400
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,166
All for <i>yokai</i> ?

401
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,625
[ASHIYA]
Am I willing to do it?

402
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,000
Serve them?

403
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,916
[ASHIYA]
You're right, Legislator.

404
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm human; there's no
getting around that fact.

405
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,333
But what you're asking
makes no sense!

406
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,208
You might as well tell me
that I need to give myself

407
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,750
to humankind.

408
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,416
I wouldn't know what you were
talking about then, either!

409
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,333
Really?

410
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,791
Well? Think about it!

411
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,916
What if you were asked to
devote yourself to humans?

412
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,541
It's a nice concept,
but what does it mean? Right?

413
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,875
Same thing applies if we're
talking about serving <i>yokai</i> ,

414
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,041
doesn't it?

415
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,541
Would you stop?
He's speaking in metaphor.

416
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,458
[LEGISLATOR]
No, no. He has a point.

417
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,375
Why would he consider
serving <i>yokai</i> ?

418
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,541
Clearly the greater good
in regard to his own kind

419
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,166
is beyond him.

420
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,625
Hang on a second.
It's not beyond me.

421
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,333
Just something, I haven't,
um, really considered

422
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,250
the scale of before, you know?

423
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,875
I wanted to help
the <i>yokai</i> I've met

424
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:43,041
through the Mononokean, on an
individual basis, at least.

425
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,083
But I dunno.

426
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,500
Maybe that means
I have the aptitude

427
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,375
for helping all of them.

428
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,041
How could we ever be sure
if you make him fire me?

429
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,291
Now, Itsuki.

430
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,791
Since Ashiya is human,

431
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,375
I assume you plan on returning
to the mundane world?

432
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,708
[ABENO]
Yeah.

433
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:00,916
[LEGISLATOR] And of course
you're opening a portal

434
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,333
to do so?

435
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,416
[ABENO] "One may only pass
between the mundane world

436
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,708
and the Underworld using
Underworld portals."

437
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,208
You instated the rule
yourself, I believe.

438
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,458
Right, and it's about
time I instated another,

439
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,791
don't you think?

440
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,166
So, "the master and his
employees are free to pass

441
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,083
between the Underworld
and the mundane world

442
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,583
using the Mononokean." 

443
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,083
There you have it.
Your well-being is important.

444
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:25,041
No use wasting energy
opening portals for Ashiya.

445
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,666
[ASHIYA]
So does that mean...?

446
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,000
[LEGISLATOR] Congratulations
on your new employee.

447
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,208
Nicely done.

448
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,791
Well, that's a relief!

449
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,875
I thought I'd be put to death
if you found out the truth!

450
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:34,958
[LEGISLATOR]
Excuse me?

451
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,208
Don't be such an idiot.

452
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,166
It's okay if the
Legislator knows.

453
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,500
Oh, gee! Thanks a lot!

454
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,583
Would've been nice if
I'd known that earlier!

455
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:42,833
I tried to say something,

456
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,708
but you were too busy
calling me names.

457
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,958
The Justice, the
Executive, and I know.

458
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,833
Matter of fact,
even Koura's in on it.

459
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,625
Itsuki being a human
isn't any shock to us.

460
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,083
[ASHIYA]
Even Koura knows about it?

461
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,416
Well, what about Shizuku?

462
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,791
[ABENO]
I haven't told her.

463
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,208
[LEGISLATOR]
The fewer <i>yokai</i> in on it,

464
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,416
the better for
everyone, I think.

465
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,958
We don't want it generally
known, understand?

466
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,458
Things could get
rather complicated.

467
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,958
See to it Itsuki's
secret is safe.

468
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,000
Sure.

469
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,583
Fuzzy?

470
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,416
[ABENO]
What's wrong, hairball?

471
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,875
[LEGISLATOR]
Charming nicknames.

472
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,625
You know, I'm rather curious
about our friend here.

473
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:21,666
Fuzzy, huh?

474
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,750
I can't help but wonder
who you are.

475
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,125
Oh, uh...

476
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,250
Well he sort of got
hurt on account of us.

477
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,833
So we're taking care of the
li'l guy until he gets better.

478
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,250
So hyper.

479
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,250
[ASHIYA gasps]

480
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,166
Fuzzy, no! I'm so sorry!
Are you okay?

481
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,375
[ABENO] Uh, he's
usually better behaved.

482
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,958
No harm done, really.

483
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,291
He just wanted to request
something while you were here.

484
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,750
Seems he's somewhat
keen on the idea

485
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,375
of coming to
work for you, too.

486
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,833
Uh... Is that okay?

487
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,875
I have no problem with it.

488
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:55,625
Hired.

489
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,000
That was easy!

490
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,458
Whoa, whoa! I'll hire my own
employees, thank you!

491
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,416
[ASHIYA]
Um... Abeno.

492
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,041
What? I'm doing
you a favor.

493
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,375
Having an actual <i>yokai</i>
around might come in handy.

494
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm instating a new rule: Itsuki
has to hire Fuzzy immediately.

495
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,875
Now it's law. So there.

496
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:14,916
But...

497
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,000
Fine. Whatever.

498
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,791
Welcome to the family, Fuzzy!

499
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:20,958
Are you excited?

500
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,166
Go ahead, both of you.

501
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,666
Okay.

502
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,416
It was a pleasure meeting you.

503
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,833
Feel free to come and
pay me a visit any time.

504
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,458
I'd love to share a bottle
of saké with you.

505
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,791
I'm too young
to drink, actually.

506
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,375
[LEGISLATOR]
Oh, that's right.

507
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,333
The mundane world has that whole
thing about underage drinking.

508
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,583
I can have some tea.

509
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:46,916
[ABENO]
Don't take him up on it.

510
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,750
Trust me: he'll talk your
ear off for hours.

511
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,625
[ASHIYA]
Go on, Fuzzy. After you.

512
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,708
[LEGISLATOR]
Itsuki.

513
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,291
[ABENO]
What?

514
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,291
Sorry for hiring the hairball.

515
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,125
I suppose I could've at least
discussed it with you first.

516
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah.

517
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,416
No, really.

518
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,750
I think I understand now.

519
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,291
You rejected all the <i>yokai</i> I
recommended for employment,

520
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,708
so I thought you simply
weren't interested.

521
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,541
You had me convinced
you wanted to go it alone

522
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,083
without having to bother
with employees at all.

523
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,541
Silly me.

524
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,541
The truth is you just
didn't want a <i>yokai</i> .

525
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,708
Well, humans aren't particularly
susceptible to parasite shrubs,

526
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,291
so I guess it makes sense.

527
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,166
Abeno? You're coming, right?

528
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,833
Want me to leave the door open?

529
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,583
[ABENO]
Give me a second.

530
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,791
[LEGISLATOR]
Not to get personal,

531
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,250
but aren't you being
just a smidge uptight?

532
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,000
You're concerned, sure.

533
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,000
But logically, the odds
of it happening again--

534
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,083
[ABENO]
Legislator...

535
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,583
Don't go there.

536
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,541
Move it!
You're in the way!

537
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,666
[ASHIYA] Hey! Why are you
so angry all of a sudden?

538
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,583
Bye! Good to
see you, Legislator.

539
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,333
[LEGISLATOR] Consummately
civilized even when he's angry.

540
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,000
Oh, Abeno.

541
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,458
Such a terrifying
master you are.

542
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,291
[ASHIYA]
Hey, you know what?

543
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,916
Since Fuzzy's with us, we're
now the Mononokean Trio!

544
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,416
[ABENO] Ashiya, call us that
again and I'll punch you.

545
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,041
[ASHIYA laughs]
Come on, it's great!

546
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,916
The Mononokean Trio!

547
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,166
[ABENO]
I warned you.
