1
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:12,166
[OKINA] So then,
you've made up your mind?

2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,125
[TOMORI]
Yes.

3
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:14,291
[OKINA]
Very well.

4
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,875
I shall go to the
Mononokean at once.

5
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:19,375
[TOMORI]
Thank you so much.

6
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:22,041
I only wish I could go myself.

7
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,666
[OKINA] It's been given me to
understand the Mononokean

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,875
has a new employee.

9
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:30,291
I look forward to having a face
to go along with the rumor.

10
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,041
[TOMORI]
Do be careful on your way.

11
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,541
An unmistakable smell.

12
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,875
Rain is coming. Count on it.

13
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,833
[OKINA] I certainly know better
than to doubt your nose.

14
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,291
Ah! Fuzzy!

15
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:22,083
I'm so glad you're
back to normal!

16
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,958
[ZENKO] Does he always
cry when he's happy?

17
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,750
[ABENO]
Ugh. Get a hold of yourself!

18
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:26,875
Have some self-respect!

19
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,583
I can't help it
if I get emotional!

20
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,250
Just let me express myself!

21
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,666
If Fuzzy's back to normal,

22
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,166
then must be the
same for Yahiko.

23
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,416
[footsteps]

24
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,833
[ZENKO]
Hey, Dad.

25
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,291
[ASHIYA]
This isn't good.

26
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,083
[ZENKO'S DAD]
Yeah, so, uh...

27
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,166
You kids have any
idea how late it is?

28
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,125
What're you doing
in place like this?

29
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:52,875
If it's abandoned, there's a
probably a damn good reason!

30
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,666
He is pissed.

31
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,000
What do we say?

32
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,083
I dunno!

33
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,291
--[loud crack]
--[ZENKO'S DAD groans]

34
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,916
Hold on to Fuzzy for a second.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,958
What's wrong?

36
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,416
[ZENKO'S DAD]
I threw out my back!

37
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,625
--[loud crack]
--[groans]

38
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,250
It was fine when
I left the temple.

39
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,250
What is it?

40
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,625
[ABENO]
Fun's over Yahiko.

41
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:14,791
No fair!

42
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,416
You saw where I was!

43
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,333
How the--?

44
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,291
Are you doing
this to my dad?

45
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,416
[YAHIKO]
Hey, Haruitsuki!

46
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,458
I can shape-shift!

47
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,583
I'm back to my old self!

48
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,958
We can play hide-and-seek again!

49
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,125
[ASHIYA]
Oh, that's right.

50
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,166
You were super gigantic
earlier. I forgot.

51
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,083
What?!

52
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,166
You're such a jerk, Ashiya!

53
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,541
Yeah, yeah. My bad.

54
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:35,875
Hey, let's get you off of there.

55
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:36,875
No!

56
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:37,875
Excuse me?

57
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,166
I don't think so!

58
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,583
If you want me to force
you, have it your way!

59
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,708
I want Haruitsuki to carry me!

60
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:44,625
Let go!

61
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,333
[ASHIYA]
You're being a brat!

62
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,875
Who the hell you talkin' to?

63
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,416
[ASHIYA]
Crap!

64
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,750
Help me out here?

65
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:53,791
No way.

66
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,583
[ZENKO'S DAD]
My back pain's gone.

67
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,666
What the--?

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,666
Well, you see, sir,
I'm kind of an introvert,

69
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,333
so I talk to myself a lot.

70
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,500
That's it. Sure. I was just
thinking out loud...

71
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:05,625
[ZENKO'S DAD]
Wait a minute.

72
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:06,958
When I couldn't stop laughing,

73
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,250
this kid showed up out
of the blue and fixed it.

74
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,291
It's something
I do all the time.

75
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,333
[ZENKO'S DAD]
Straight answer.

76
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,833
Did you just heal my back?

77
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:13,875
What?

78
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,291
How are you with
high blood pressure?

79
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,708
Can you cure that, too?

80
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,083
You might wanna see
a doctor about that one.

81
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:22,083
A-ha! So you did fix
my back! I knew it!

82
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:25,708
We should probably step in
and help him at some point.

83
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,041
[ASHIYA]
What do I do?

84
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,375
If I tell him it was a <i>yokai</i> ,

85
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,916
he'll think I'm
screwing with him!

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,750
Dad, leave him alone.

87
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:32,666
[ZENKO'S DAD]
Huh?

88
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,291
[ZENKO]
Hanae can see spirits.

89
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,041
There was a ghost on your back.

90
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,625
He saw it and figured he'd
take care of it for you.

91
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:40,750
A ghost?!

92
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,500
No kidding?

93
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,291
You saw it on my back?

94
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,500
Wha...

95
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,375
What was it doing there
in the first place?

96
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,750
Oh. I, uh...

97
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,416
I don't know, but it was there.

98
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,750
[ZENKO'S DAD gasps]

99
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,333
Dad can't see spirits,
but he's a total believer.

100
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,791
Mom used to say the idea
scared him half to death.

101
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,083
Poor guy can't even sit
through a horror movie.

102
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,458
Makes you wonder
why he became a monk.

103
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,958
[ZENKO'S DAD]
That's it!

104
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,041
Come and work for me
at the temple!

105
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,375
[ASHIYA]
What?

106
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,333
Folks come in off the street
requesting exorcisms

107
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,416
all the time!

108
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,416
I need you!

109
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,458
Actually, sir, uh...
Hey! Abeno!

110
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,958
You can hear him, can't you?

111
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,083
[ABENO]
Yep.

112
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,375
C'mon, Ashida. Please?

113
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,541
[ASHIYA]
It's Ashiya.

114
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:20,416
Zenko.

115
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,083
Did something good happen?

116
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,250
What's going on?

117
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,916
Seems kind of weird,
don't you think?

118
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,083
Mm-hmm.

119
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,375
It's a little weird.

120
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,500
But it is pretty good.

121
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,333
Dad doesn't wanna kill Hanae.

122
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,833
In fact, he's practically
gushing over him.

123
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,000
Anyway...

124
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,750
What the hell were
you doing with Zenko?

125
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,708
Not what it looks like!

126
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:43,541
Is he...?

127
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,750
Mm-hmm.

128
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:47,791
Uh-oh.

129
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,000
[ABENO]
We should get going.

130
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,291
And Yahiko?
I'm not playing with you.

131
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,875
[YAHIKO]
Aww!

132
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,333
Doesn't look like it's
gonna let up any time soon.

133
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,958
[ABENO] Least we got back
before it started pouring.

134
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,166
Lucky us.

135
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,041
That old man didn't
wanna let you leave.

136
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,458
[ASHIYA]
Don't put that on me!

137
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,625
I didn't know it
was supposed to rain.

138
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,916
Incidentally, I didn't
bring an umbrella.

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,291
Can the Mononokean
give me a lift?

140
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,416
[bell ringing]

141
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,500
[ASHIYA]
Little steep, don't you think?

142
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,375
[ASHIYA chuckles]

143
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,666
[ABENO]
A guest?

144
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,416
No one made an
appointment today.

145
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,458
[ASHIYA]
Be right there!

146
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,958
Welcome!

147
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,125
[OKINA]
Hello.

148
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,875
[OKINA] Raining rather
a lot this evening

149
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,416
in the mundane world, isn't it?

150
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,833
[ABENO]
It's Okina.

151
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,416
[ASHIYA]
Boss. Do we have any towels?

152
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,625
Maybe some hot tea?

153
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,458
[OKINA gulping]

154
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,458
[OKINA]
Sorry to drop in like this.

155
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,708
It's fine.

156
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,666
[OKINA] And apologies
for being so drenched.

157
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,416
I fell into a puddle
on the way here.

158
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,583
[laughs] The skies won't clear
for a few hours, I'm told.

159
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:00,625
You don't say.

160
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,041
[OKINA]
Excuse me, young sir,

161
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,666
but are you the new employee?

162
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,916
Oh, yes.

163
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,166
My name's Ashiya.

164
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,416
[OKINA]
Nice to meet you.

165
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,250
My name is Inogaratake
Yuuhi Takino Okinakami.

166
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,083
Wait... "Kami"?

167
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,583
Are you a god?

168
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:15,833
[OKINA laughs]

169
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,000
Gracious, no.
Just an old <i>yokai</i> .

170
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,666
Humans tend to
inflate my status.

171
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,958
Call me Okina, please.

172
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,000
[bell ringing]

173
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,500
So, have you always lived
in the mundane world?

174
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,625
[OKINA laughs]

175
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, I'm fond enough of it

176
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,791
that I selfishly
requested to stay.

177
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,208
Which brings me to the purpose

178
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,208
of my unannounced visit
this evening, Abeno.

179
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:45,250
A <i>yokai</i> in need of your help is
waiting for us near the shrine.

180
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,666
I assume there's a reason
you didn't bring them?

181
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,333
Why'd you leave them behind?

182
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,791
[OKINA] I'm afraid the poor
dear doesn't have the use

183
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,500
of her eyes.

184
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,458
Whoa.

185
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,041
I don't understand.

186
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,791
What exactly are you getting at?

187
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,250
[OKINA] Sight comes to
her only through vision

188
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,541
of human beings
able to see <i>yokai</i> .

189
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,750
On loan, so to speak.

190
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,458
She needs to borrow the
sight of someone like you.

191
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:15,375
[OKINA laughs] It sounds
a lot graver than it is.

192
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,041
She's not asking much.

193
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,791
Just to be exorcised
and sent to the Underworld.

194
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,375
Forgive my indiscretion.

195
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,125
[OKINA] Besides,
it's not a painful process.

196
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,958
The person who grants
their vision to her

197
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,041
has it back in a matter of days.

198
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:31,708
[ABENO]
Very well.

199
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,416
I humbly accept your request.

200
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,750
[OKINA]
We'd be grateful if you wait

201
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,791
until after the skies clear.

202
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,916
For the time being,
might I impose on you

203
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,333
for another cup of tea?

204
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,958
[ABENO]
It would be my pleasure.

205
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,708
Stay as long as you wish.

206
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,166
[OKINA laughs]
How kind.

207
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,750
I believe I'll make
myself at home, then.

208
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:51,875
Thank you.

209
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,583
[TOMORI]
What's that I hear?

210
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,125
Footsteps. Okina.

211
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,625
He brings two others.

212
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:06,958
[OKINA]
Thank you for waiting.

213
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,208
You must be Master Abeno
of the Mononokean.

214
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,416
Indeed I am,
and you must be Tomori,

215
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,375
am I right?

216
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,833
Yes.

217
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,583
I appreciate your assistance
more than you could know.

218
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,083
Happy to be of help.

219
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,000
Am I mistaken, or did I hear
another set of footsteps?

220
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,708
[OKINA] That would be
his employee, Ashiya.

221
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,250
[TOMORI] Yes, of course.
Good to meet you.

222
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,291
It's good to meet
you, too, ma'am.

223
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,583
[TOMORI] I'm grateful the
two of you could come.

224
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,750
Excuse me if I
cut right to the chase,

225
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,625
but I'm afraid this area's
not quite big enough

226
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,375
for me to open a portal.

227
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,208
Would it be possible for
us to take this business

228
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,666
somewhere else, perhaps?

229
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,083
If need be.

230
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,500
Here, I'll help lead you.

231
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,041
[TOMORI gasps]
A human?

232
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,625
You're gifted with the
ability to see <i>yokai</i> .

233
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,125
It's been ages.

234
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,083
I can't remember the
last time I encountered

235
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,291
one of you here in
the mundane world.

236
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,500
Uh... Um...

237
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,625
Do you mind if I ask how long
you've been without sight?

238
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:03,916
[TOMORI]
I don't know.

239
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,916
Quite some time, surely.

240
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,083
I'm embarrassed to admit it's
been so long I can't remember.

241
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,625
Yet...

242
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,166
I remember all the things I've
seen in the mundane world.

243
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,458
Its beauty is unsurpassed.

244
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,041
I could exist for
millennia and not forget.

245
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,333
If only I could stay here.

246
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,666
Alas, it's become too difficult.

247
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,708
Shame, but I must go back.

248
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,250
I hope returning
to the Underworld

249
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,125
will restore my sight.

250
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,416
I miss being able
to take everything in.

251
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,250
[ASHIYA]
Why is he glaring at me?

252
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,000
[ASHIYA]
Uh, Tomori?

253
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,166
Sorry to keep
getting all personal.

254
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,000
But don't hold back on me, 'kay?

255
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,458
Would you like to see
the mundane world again?

256
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,583
Before you leave?

257
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,125
You misunderstood!

258
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,791
That isn't what I was trying
to imply in the least!

259
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:54,833
I'm sorry.

260
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,250
Please don't worry about me.

261
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,208
[ASHIYA]
No, it's fine!

262
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,666
You don't have to be sorry!

263
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,208
I just knew if didn't
put it out there,

264
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,250
I'd kick myself for not asking!

265
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,125
Kick yourself?

266
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,791
I thought maybe you
really wanted to see

267
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,916
this world again before you
go and just couldn't ask.

268
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,041
I had to be sure, y'know?

269
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:14,125
I'd have regretted not offering.

270
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,625
Besides, and I don't mean
this to sound patronizing

271
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,375
or anything.

272
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,708
But I thought if all it cost
me was not seeing <i>yokai</i>

273
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,000
for a few days...

274
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:22,875
Well...

275
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,166
It's not too big a deal. Right?

276
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,791
[ASHIYA]
He didn't shoot it down.

277
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,166
That's a good sign.

278
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,083
[TOMORI sighs]

279
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,250
To be completely honest,

280
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:42,583
I would love to look upon this
world one last time before I go.

281
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,750
If you would be so kind,
May I borrow your sight?

282
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,416
[TOMORI] Ashiya.
Close your eyes for me.

283
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,458
Sure.

284
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:29,041
Hey, where'd they go?

285
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,625
Oh. That's right.

286
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,208
That was the condition,
wasn't it?

287
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,541
What about her?

288
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,541
Can Tomori see the world?

289
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,583
Yes. You should go home.

290
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,125
[ASHIYA]
What? But...

291
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:46,083
If you can't see <i>yokai</i> ,
you'll only get in my way.

292
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,500
[ASHIYA] You don't have
to say it like that!

293
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,458
I'm doing my job!

294
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,750
What would you have
done without your--?

295
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:51,875
[ABENO]
Watch where you step.

296
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm sorry, Fuzzy!

297
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,458
When you can see <i>yokai</i> again,
I'll put you back to work.

298
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,333
Till then, go home.

299
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,083
[ASHIYA]
Fine. I'll get out of your hair.

300
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,375
[OKINA]
Tomori, can you see?

301
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:21,916
Yes!

302
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,625
The sky, the clouds,
the flowers.

303
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,833
All of it's so breathtaking!

304
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,416
I'm overwhelmed!

305
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,750
Please, Abeno.

306
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,166
Give Ashiya my heartfelt thanks.

307
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,333
I'm so very grateful.

308
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:44,750
Tell him I departed for the
Underworld free of regrets.

309
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:45,875
Won't you?

310
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,166
Yes.

311
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:52,916
[ASHIYA]
I'm home.

312
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
How was your day?

313
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,750
Sweetie? What's wrong?

314
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:58,666
Nothing.

315
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,125
[ASHIYA'S MOM]
Hmm... Okay.

316
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,125
He looks like he
lost his best friend.

317
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,625
[ASHIYA] It's rough not
being able to see Fuzzy

318
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,291
and the Mononokean.

319
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,250
Oh, well.

320
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,875
It's only for a few days.

321
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,708
I'll power through.

322
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,916
[ASHIYA'S MOM]
Purple coneflowers.

323
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,458
Aren't they gorgeous?

324
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,625
They say
"I will heal your pain."

325
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,625
What're you
talking about, Mom?

326
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,291
I'm not in any kind of pain.

327
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,833
You do seem a bit better.

328
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,500
Best be goin'. See you later.

329
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,208
Have fun at school!

330
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,125
[ASHIYA'S MOM]
That's a relief.

331
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,958
It's finally been three days.

332
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,541
Man, talk about
feeling like forever!

333
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,416
Woo-hoo!

334
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,041
Can't wait to cuddle with Fuzzy!

335
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:03,666
[ASHIYA]
Seriously?

336
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,208
I don't think you've ever
gotten here earlier than me.

337
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,916
I'm surprised you're awake.

338
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,791
So. It's been three days,
which means my second sight

339
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,125
should be back to normal!

340
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,375
Yeah, well it's not.

341
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,541
[ASHIYA]
Uh...

342
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,250
What is that supposed to mean?

343
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,250
Is Fuzzy here?

344
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,416
Yes. He just jumped on you.

345
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,000
Where is he?

346
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,291
I can't see him!

347
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,416
Why can't I see him?

348
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,666
Guess it's gonna take
longer than we thought.

349
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,625
Fuzzy. I'm sorry.

350
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,708
[ASHIYA]
Two days later.

351
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:44,666
Your left!

352
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,250
Nice try, but he's sitting
smack dab on top

353
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,250
of your head.

354
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,333
[ASHIYA]
Ah!

355
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,166
He was supposed
to be in your hand!

356
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,000
No fair! You tricked me!

357
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,791
You wouldn't have fallen for it
if you could actually see him.

358
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,666
We're done for the day,
so go home.

359
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,458
[ASHIYA]
I don't understand.

360
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,375
It's been five whole days now.

361
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,666
Why can't I see him yet?

362
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,583
Okina and Tomori didn't seem
the type to pull one over on me.

363
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,708
So you can't see 'em
and you can't hear 'em.

364
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,291
That's great.

365
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,166
Hear them?

366
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,708
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

367
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,208
[ASHIYA]
What am I gonna do?

368
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,750
This sucks!

369
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,791
How much longer do I have to
wait till I can see Fuzzy again?

370
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:25,500
Damn! There has to be some
way to restore my sight!

371
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,041
Ashiya.

372
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,375
Yeah?

373
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,500
That's enough.

374
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,333
Wait... What do you mean?

375
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,500
[ABENO]
It's time for you to quit.

376
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,625
Look, I'm willing to keep
you on until I can find

377
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,041
your replacement.

378
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,375
It's just...

379
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,625
I don't have anything you
can help with right now.

380
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,333
Guys in my position can't
afford to get sentimental

381
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,875
or complacent.

382
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,916
Truth is, I'm bad
enough tolerating people

383
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,500
who are useful to me,
let alone dead weight.

384
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,041
Am I really useless?

385
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:08,291
It's been five days. That's all.

386
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,833
And already he's...

387
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,083
[ASHIYA] So you're letting
me go, is that it?

388
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,041
[ASHIYA]
I get it, okay?

389
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,458
I can't see <i>yokai</i> .

390
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,250
I don't blame you for
wanting to find someone else.

391
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,833
There's not much I
can do for you like this.

392
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,208
Still, though.

393
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,333
"Dead weight?"
Where the hell do you get off?

394
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,000
I didn't come to you
looking for a job.

395
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,916
I came to you for help.

396
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,250
Next thing I know, boom.

397
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,291
Suddenly I have to work off
a massive debt, or else.

398
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:49,166
Being able to see <i>yokai</i>
terrified me at first,

399
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,833
but I've changed.

400
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:54,458
When by ability returns,
we'll pick up where we left off!

401
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,583
That's a promise.

402
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,125
Before this is all over, you'll
be on your hands and knees

403
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,791
begging me to come back!

404
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,291
You're gonna have
to work really hard

405
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,750
to make that happen.

406
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,750
Wouldn't hold my
breath if I were you.

407
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,875
[ZENKO]
What happened to your face?

408
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,000
Stupid Ashiya
hit me with his shoe!

409
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,375
I hate him! He's a meanie!

410
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,083
[ZENKO]
That doesn't sound like him.

411
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,916
So, what did you
end up buying?

412
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,750
Lemon drops and a croquette.

413
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,000
And some coffee.

414
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,916
Aw, man. I should've
gotten a croquette.

415
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,916
[FUSSHI] What's up?
You're not gonna get anything?

416
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,375
No appetite.

417
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,458
[FUSSHI]
You seem a little tired.

418
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:48,750
Do you need a pick-me-up?

419
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,250
How about some coffee?

420
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,500
Here, take mine.

421
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,000
That's so nice of you.

422
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,125
Thanks a lot.

423
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,708
[SAGA]
You should take a look at this.

424
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:56,833
[ASHIYA]
Oh, yeah?

425
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,458
[ASHIYA]
Wanted ads?

426
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,833
Figured you could use it
to find yourself a job.

427
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,333
But I haven't been
fired from my old one.

428
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,666
Not yet.

429
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,583
Let's face it, man,
it's only a matter of time.

430
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,666
Well that all depends on me.

431
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,000
Why get a job when
you could join a club?

432
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,166
What kind of club?

433
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,541
Photography's been really cool.

434
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,291
[ASHIYA]
Before I started high school,

435
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,625
that's exactly the sort
of thing I saw myself doing.

436
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,833
Then Abeno started eating
up all of my free time.

437
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,291
[SAGA]
I'm thinking nature stuff.

438
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,875
[ASHIYA] Now, though...
What's stopping me?

439
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,708
[SAGA]
Really? Let's do it!

440
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,125
[TEACHER 11A] Solving for a
system of linear inequalities

441
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:37,583
requires finding values for
each of the variables...

442
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,958
[ASHIYA]
Did Abeno take the day off?

443
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,958
Maybe he's on a job.

444
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,250
Good for him.

445
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,208
Not that I care
one way or the other.

446
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,291
Please. Who am I kidding?

447
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,791
This is torture.

448
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:53,041
Feels like I've been
left out in the cold.

449
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm not ready to let go yet.

450
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,458
[bell ringing]

451
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,416
Why wouldn't I be?

452
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,250
Right. I'm off.

453

Hey.

Hey, there!

He's here! It's Itsuki!

00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,500
Ah, darling!

458
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,666
You're back sooner
than expected.

[KOURA]
Don't worry.

460
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,208
We took care to
whip up some extra

461
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,458
so there won't be
a repeat of last time.

462
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,500
Appreciate it.

463
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,958
That's right,
I haven't told you.

464
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,041
The screeching <i>yokai</i> 's
doing better.

465
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,208
That's good to hear.

466
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,625
I think he really
misses you and Ashiya.

467
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:41,958
Ah.

468
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,583
Speaking of Ashiya,
why isn't he with you today?

469
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,750
Oh, yeah. Y'know, I was just
thinking it seemed a little

470
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,458
on the quiet side.

471
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,125
Afraid I had to
leave him behind.

472
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,458
That's too bad.
Is he feeling okay?

473
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:54,916
I wanted to say hi.

474
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,416
Yes, quite a shame.

Such a lovely pair
of ears that boy has.

Well, not as lovely as mine,

483
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,333
Nah.

484
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,916
I just thought I'd
drop by and say hello.

485
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,416
Kind of curious to see
what he's up to these days.

486
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,166
Good seeing you, ladies.

487
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,250
[SHIZUKU]
Aw! You're leaving already?

488
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,125
Sorry. Wish I could stay.

489
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,375
We'll visit longer
next time, I promise.

490
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,583
Of course.

491
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,958
Pleasure as always.

492
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,416
Darken our door
whenever you wish.

493
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,750
And bring dear
Ashiya along, won't you?

494
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,750
Hard to believe he's going
to see the Legislator

495
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,583
of his own free will.

496
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,250
Huh. Very odd.
Very odd indeed.

497
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,416
It's been a while. Or has it?

498
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:34,541
[ASHIYA]
Hey, Zenko?

499
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,250
Question: How d'you get Yahiko
to help around the temple?

500
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,083
[ZENKO] I brush his hair,
give him treats,

501
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,750
take him for walks
when he gets bored.

502
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:41,833
Stuff like that.

503
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,750
When he feels like it,
he pitches in.

504
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:46,500
[ASHIYA] So he's less of a
helper and more of a pet.
