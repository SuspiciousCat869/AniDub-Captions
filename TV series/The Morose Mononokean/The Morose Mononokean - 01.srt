This is it.

00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,708
Today's the day.

3
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,666
I'm actually gonna make it.

4
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:35,083
Come on. You've got this.

5
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:40,583
[ASHIYA sighs]

6
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:44,166
[ASHIYA] Okay, on second
thought, maybe not.

7
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,125
Get it together, man.
<i>Yokai</i> aren't real.

8
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:50,958
Just a story made up
for kids. Right?

9
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,458
At least that's what
I used to tell myself.

10
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,208
[ASHIYA]
Several days ago...

11
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,958
[ASHIYA'S MOM] Hanae, sweetie,
can you do me a favor?

12
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,250
[ASHIYA]
What is it?

13
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,000
Do you mind stopping by
the store and picking up

14
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,666
a few things for dinner tonight?

15
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,958
Yeah, sure.

16
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,125
[ASHIYA'S MOM]
Thanks.

17
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:39,166
Back-to-school season's
got me super busy.

18
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,541
Voilà!

19
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,125
These are for you.
For being such a good son.

20
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,250
Let's call it a
"proud mother's bouquet."

21
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,833
[ASHIYA] Do you have to express
everything with flowers?

22
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:52,375
[ASHIYA] Bell peppers.
Eggs. Baby carrots.

23
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,916
Cool, that's everything
on the list.

Just a stuffed animal.

26
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,541
Some kid must've dropped it.

27
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,625
Now you'll be easier
for your owner to find,

28
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,333
and no one else'll step on ya.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,500
I did a good deed!

30
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,625
Am I ready for high school
or am I ready for high school?

Get offa me!

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,458
What is this thing?

38
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,500
[ASHIYA]
I'm home.

39
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:48,583
How did it go?

40
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,291
I thought you'd be back before--

41
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,916
Honey, you look awful.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,083
Is everything all right?

43
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,833
Not by a long shot.

44
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,416
I can't get whatever
this is off of me.

45
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,916
[ASHIYA'S MOM]
What are you talking about?

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,958
This thing. It's stuck.

47
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,416
Hm? Do you mean your hood?

48
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,083
[ASHIYA'S MOM]
Crocuses.

49
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,250
In the language of flowers,
they say, "I believe you,

50
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,916
but I'm a bit concerned."

51

[ASHIYA]
She can't see it?

52
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,791
[ASHIYA]
What's wrong with me?

53
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:21,500
I have a headache,
I'm nauseous, crazy tired,

54
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:25,666
so off-balance it's all I can
do to walk in a straight line.

55
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,833
And as far as I can tell,

56
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,750
I'm the only one that
can see this thing.

57
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,333
Almost there.

58
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,666
Just a little farther.

Wait, am I...
in the nurse's office?

Oh. Yes, you collapsed at
the front gate this morning.

65
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,666
What? I should get to class!

00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,666
Now, now.
Don't get all worked up.

[ASHIYA] Way to start
things off on the right foot.

70
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,375
I spent my first day of
high school unconscious.

71
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,291
To make matters worse,
I still feel like crap.

Clearly, the common
denominator here...

73

...is this stupid fuzz ball!

My whole high school experience
has been in the nurse's office!

bigger by the day.

I can't tell if this is
real, but you never know.

Odds are I'm walking into
someone's idea of a joke.

I'll end up a laughingstock.

But if there's even
a remote possibility

00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,291
of shaking this thing...

128

waiting outside?

take a seat over there.

totally shrank!

I don't have all day.

Take off your shoes.

00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,291
Right!

159
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,500
[ASHIYA] Has the nurse's office
always been next to a tearoom?

Here you go.

00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,541
So, like, are you a...?

162
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,583
Indeed.

163
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,416
I am the master
of this Mononokean.

164
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,166
Haruitski Abeno.

165
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,291
So, when will you
be able to start?

166
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,250
[ASHIYA]
Huh?

167
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,875
[sighs]

168
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,458
Guess you'll have to do.

169
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,958
A bit scrawnier than I'd like,

170
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,916
but the only one
who answered my ad.

171
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,375
Actually, though...

172
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,916
I'm not here looking for work.

173
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,708
I was hoping you
could help me out.

174
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,583
Wait. You need my help?

175
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,541
This weird fuzzy thing's
latched on to my back;

176
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,375
it's caused me
nothing but problems!

177
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,833
I saw your post and thought
maybe you could do an exorcism!

178
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,208
That is, if this is for real.

179
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,416
I mean, that is the kind
of thing you do, right?

180
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,250
[ABENO]
Of course. Consider it done.

181
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,875
Oh, that'd be awesome!
I've been living a nightmare!

182
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,750
Wow. You actually
thought I was serious.

183
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,791
Get out and stop
wasting my time.

184
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,166
Huh?!

185
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,125
Hold on a minute!

186
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,500
Will you let go of me?

187
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,958
There's gotta be
something you can do!

188
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,416
C'mon, I'm begging!

189
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,208
I only let you in
here because I thought

190
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,541
you were looking for work!

191
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,000
If it's an exorcism
you're after,

192
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm afraid you'll just
have to wait your turn!

193
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,208
How long are we talking about?

194
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,583
You have other
customers or something?

195
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,250
About ten days.

196
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,041
Ten days?

197
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,583
If that's not good enough
for you, do something

198
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,500
about it yourself.

199
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,625
[ASHIYA]
No, no. It's fine. I'll wait.

200
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,583
[ASHIYA] Will I even
be alive in ten days?

201
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,125
Very well.

202
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,416
Tell me who you are and I can
put you on the waiting list.

203
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,708
[ASHIYA]
Hanae Ashiya.

204
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,833
That's your name?

205
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,625
[ABENO]
Ashiya? Really?

206
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,458
There some kind of problem?

207
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,833
What's the big deal?

208
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,625
[ABENO]
Fine.

209
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,291
I'll do the exorcism now.

210
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,291
You mean I won't have to wait?

211
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,041
I changed my mind.

212
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,000
Now, step outside, please.

213
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,916
I'll be right behind you.

214
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,125
Yeah. Sure thing.

215
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,750
There's no door.

216
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:19,708
[ABENO]
Look down.

217
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,083
It's at your feet.

218
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,666
[ASHIYA]
Really? Uh...

219
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,416
Could someone tell me what's
going on here, please?

220
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,083
[ASHIYA]
What the--?

221
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,750
How am I on the roof?!

222
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,166
[ABENO]
Keep your voice down.

223
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,416
It's annoying.

224
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,625
But the nurse's office
is on the first floor,

225
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,375
and now we're way up here.

226
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,666
I don't know about you,
but my head's spinning.

227
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,291
[gasping]

228
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,083
It's getting... bigger!

229
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,083
Yes it is.

230
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,833
[ASHIYA]
I can't take this anymore!

231
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,791
Please, you've got to make
it go away, Abeno!

232
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,291
I'll be a dead man
in a matter of hours

233
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,666
if this giant marshmallow
sticks around much longer!

234
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,958
You're not helping.

235
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,458
Stop kicking it and shut up.

236
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,375
[ASHIYA yells]

237
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,166
[ASHIYA coughing]

238
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,875
[ASHIYA]
What's that about?

239
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,666
Why does he look so grim
all of a sudden?

240
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,458
Is that some sort
of exorcism tool?

241
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,500
Maybe...

242
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,291
...a deadly spell?

243
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,333
Oh, man.

244
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,291
Inflating one of these is
always harder than you think.

245
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,125
[ASHIYA]
Are you kidding?!

246
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,791
What's a beach ball got to do
with exorcising this thing?

247
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,750
What are talking about?
I'm playing.

248
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,583
[growling]

249
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,500
[ASHIYA] Now you're
just messing with me!

250
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,416
[ASHIYA]
That's it! I'm done!

251
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,958
If you don't want to help, fine,
but you don't have to be a jerk!

252
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,458
Just so you know,

253
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,333
kicking a guy while he's down
isn't a nice thing to do!

254
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,833
Super not cool!

255
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,250
I knew it.

256
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,750
You're exactly like the others.

257
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:58,875
What?

258
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,083
[ABENO]
Look, man.

259
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,250
Just so you know...

260
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,500
It's no skin off
my nose if you die.

261
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,958
I don't do this for people.
