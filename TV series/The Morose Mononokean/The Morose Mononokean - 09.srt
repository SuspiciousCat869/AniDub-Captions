1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,916
When you say "next job,"

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,750
you mean you found us another
client while I was gone?

3
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:17,875
That's what you were doing
when I was with Jomatsu.

4
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:18,875
You, uh...

5
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,125
You only talked
with them, right?

6
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:22,166
Yeah.

7
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:28,041
[ASHIYA] So, then, we're
gonna exorcise a <i>yokai</i> today.

8
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,625
Wonder how it'll go.

9
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,375
[ABENO]
Wait here, I need to change.

10
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:34,416
[ASHIYA]
Sure.

11
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:39,125
[ASHIYA] Is it me, or does
he seem kinda depressed?

12
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,166
[bell ringing]

13
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,916
[ASHIYA] Hm... Your guess
is as good as mine.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,458
I haven't heard any details.

15
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,166
[ASHIYA]
Definitely news to me if it is.

16
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,125
[ASHIYA]
Whoa.

17
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:58,000
We've worked with
people before, indirectly.

18
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:01,333
But this'd be the first
time one's come to us.

19
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:02,375
Huh.

20
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,500
[ASHIYA]
It's like a freakin' palace!

21
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,166
[GIRL]
Glad you could make it!

22
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,875
Wait... There's two of you?

23
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,500
This is my assistant.

24
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,291
My name's Ashiya.
Very nice to meet you.

25
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,416
Cool. Whatev. Follow me.

26
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,458
[ASHIYA]
Uh...

27
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,416
[GIRL] Sorry I couldn't give
you the deets when we talked.

28
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,166
Of all the days for my mom
to come home early, right?

29
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,750
It's okay.

30
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,000
[ASHIYA]
This is our client?

31
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,541
[GIRL] The room we need
you to exorcise is up here.

32
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,125
My room, actually.

33
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,666
[ABENO] That's where
the phenomena appear

34
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,333
to be concentrated?

35
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:14,833
[GIRL]
Like crazy.

36
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,041
[ASHIYA] I wonder what
could be going on in there.

37
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,250
And these would be what?

38
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,625
[ASHIYA] I'm guessing
this must be the place.

39
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,958
[GIRL] I made my own
sealing talismans.

40
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,208
There's a cool website
that shows you how.

41
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,416
I don't think they're
working, though.

42
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,125
[ABENO]
Yeah. No.

43
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,750
[GIRL]
Hey!

44
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,333
I put a lot of work into those!

45
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,541
[ABENO]
Ah, so that's it.

46
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,458
[ASHIYA]
What?

47
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,750
[GIRL]
It's a ghost, isn't it!

48
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,916
Can you see it?
What's it like?

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,375
[ABENO]
I wasn't holding my breath,

50
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,583
but there is
something in there.

51
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,750
[ASHIYA]
Okay.

52
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,166
You gonna give us more?

53
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,791
[ABENO]
Look sharp, hairball.

54
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,583
Uh... Me, too?

55
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,208
[ABENO sighs]

56
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,916
Keep her busy.
Don't let her come in.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,958
[ASHIYA]
Sure.

58
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,500
[GIRL] What are you doing?
I wanna see!

59
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,041
Hey, listen, um...

60
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:10,416
We'd greatly appreciate it
if you stayed out here.

61
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,458
You guys think I'll
get in the way, don't ya.

62
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,541
No, no.

63
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,916
It's just that
exorcisms require focus.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,916
Plus, it could be dangerous.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,916
Aww! I wanted to see up close!

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,250
Hold on, you're getting
a kick outta this?

67
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,708
Uh, okay, then.

68
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,541
What'd you say your name was?

69
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:29,625
[ASHIYA]
Ashiya.

70
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,291
Fine, Ashiya.
How's an exorcism work?

71
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:35,583
[ASHIYA] Well, um, it
various from case to case.

72
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,791
So, can you, like,
see dead people?

73
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:38,958
Are they creepy?

74
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,333
Like, do they talk to you?

75
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,708
[ASHIYA]
Uh...

76
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,833
What's the scariest case
you've ever been called on?

77
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,208
Please tell me an evil
spirit was involved!

78
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,291
I track down paranormal
hot spots through this app

79
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,125
on my phone. It's awesome.

80
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,375
You probably use it, too.

81
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,750
[ASHIYA]
Can you stop right there?

82
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,041
Um, what kind of
activity's been going on?

83
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,208
Parts of the room will start
shaking like an earthquake

84
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,500
or something.

85
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,166
I swear it's not me.

86
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,541
Ooh! Know what I think?

87
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,708
I think it's a poltergeist!

88
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,500
A-A poltergeist?

89
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,083
When'd you first notice it?

90
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,333
Wait, your boss
didn't tell you?

91
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,666
Well...

92
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,916
[GIRL sighs]

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,458
Why do I have to stay
here with the lackey?

94
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,000
What do you think's
going on in there?

95
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,750
Can I just take a peek? Please?

96
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:24,000
[ASHIYA] This is what it's
like working for a human, huh?

97
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,000
Guess I can see why
Abeno was so depressed.

98
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,500
Anyway...

99
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,333
What kind of <i>yokai</i> are
we dealing with here?

100
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,125
[WOMAN]
Who are you?

101
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,000
[GIRL]
Oh, Mom! You're home!

102
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,375
It's okay:
he's just an exorcist.

103
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,458
[ASHIYA]
Hello.

104
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,291
[ASHIYA]
Is she mad?

105
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,458
She's glaring at me hardcore.

106
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,375
I can't believe you'd
go behind my back

107
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,000
and hire one after
I told you not to!

108
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,458
If I wanna pay for an
exorcist with my own allowance,

109
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:52,416
what's the big deal?

110
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,791
Don't take that tone!

111
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,000
I won't have you throwing
away good money!

112
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,833
I'm not throwing
away good money.

113
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,875
These guys are totally
legit, I promise!

114
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,041
It's all a bunch of nonsense!

115
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,041
[ASHIYA]
Uh-oh.

116
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,000
They're making a scene.
Not good.

117
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,541
[WOMAN]
It's all in your head!

118
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,041
Sorry. I need to ask
you both to calm down.

119
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,500
Very well.

120
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,291
No point arguing
about superstition

121
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,750
here in the hallway.

122
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,083
I'm having my daughter put
on some tea so we can talk.

123
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,250
Oh. Thank you.

124
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,916
She didn't have to, though.

125
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,750
[ASHIYA] I hope Abeno and
Fuzzy are okay up there.

126
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:32,541
[WOMAN]
So...

127
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,916
Uh... Yes, ma'am?

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,833
I assume you're
a high school student?

129
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,791
I'm in my first year,
as a matter of fact.

130
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,250
And the boy in my
daughter's room right now,

131
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,916
the one from the other day.

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,125
He's your age?

133
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,250
Yes, we sit next to
each other in class.

134
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,333
Technically.

135
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,000
And you expect me to
believe that you're exorcists?

136
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,500
Do you buy this
claptrap yourselves,

137
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,458
or are you just hoping I do?

138
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,500
Um...

139
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,791
[ASHIYA] I see.
Explains the look on her face.

140
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,166
She thinks we're full of it.

141
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,875
I don't pretend
to be a scientist,

142
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,833
but this all seems
rather dubious.

143
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,791
From what I understand,
you people think you have

144
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,250
a sixth sense or
something along those lines.

145
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,416
Well, that's one way
of putting it, I guess.

146
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,166
I'm not an exorcist though,
I'm just his assistant.

147
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,416
All I do is help.

148
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,125
But you're familiar
with how exorcisms

149
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,666
are purported to work.

150
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,916
[ASHIYA] I'm not a fan of where
this conversation is headed.

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,041
Excuse me.

152
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,583
Speaking of being his assistant,

153
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,125
I should get back up
there and do my job.

154
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,750
You're trying to duck out
because you know

155
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,125
what I'm about to ask.

156
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,041
Whatever gave you that idea?

157
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,083
[WOMAN]
Explain the process to me.

158
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,916
[ASHIYA]
Not sure I can.

159
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,208
Maybe, if I try to spell it
out for her step by step.

[ASHIYA] You know what,
let me run that by you again.

Abeno is able to open up
portals to the Underworld,

164
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,166
then he sends <i>yokai</i> through.

165
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,916
Not everyone can do that.
The ability is unique to him.

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,166
If you can't see <i>yokai</i> ,
you can't see the portals.

No.

some kind of hallucination.

Okay. I've covered everything;
what else is there?

Oh, well. I tried.

getting out of this?

It made me feel sicker than
I've ever been in my life.

320
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,166
And I was terrified.

321
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,041
It's hard for me to
remember a worse time.

322
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,125
But now we're pretty
much best buddies.

323
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,583
Yeah, bet you didn't
see that coming, did ya?

324
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,625
How did it happen?

325
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,708
You'd think it's 'cause
I can see <i>yokai</i> .

326
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:03,791
But actually, it's 'cause I
learned why he latched on to me.

327
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:07,333
I didn't realize it at the
time, but Fuzzy was lonesome.

328
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,666
When I first saw him,
I was scared.

329
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,166
But since then,
I've met a whole lot of <i>yokai</i> .

330
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,833
Now, seeing one
doesn't even faze me.

331
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,708
Abeno and I are human.

332
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,375
You're frightened.
I don't blame you.

333
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,166
I'd feel the same in your shoes.

334
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,916
This is all new.

335
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,333
You don't know what's up.

336
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,833
[YOKAI growling]

337
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,875
[ABENO]
Things got quiet.

338
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,583
[ASHIYA]
All right, boss.

339
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,833
Um, he's better now.

340
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,833
[chuckles] The two of 'em
seem to get along well.

341
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,833
Yeah. Take care, my friend.

342
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,333
Goodbye, Spikey.

343
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,583
Nice to meet ya.

344
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,541
[ABENO]
Again, ma'am.

345
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,250
I sincerely apologize
for the inconvenience.

346
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,708
[WOMAN]
It's okay.

347
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,458
Your daughter paid me a fee.

348
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,625
I'd like to give
it back, if I could.

349
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,875
Your fee isn't
the issue, young man.

350
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,083
As far as I'm concerned,
you can keep it.

351
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,500
I may not understand exactly
what you did in there,

352
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,500
but it seemed to work,
so there's that.

353
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,375
Now leave and never come
near my daughter again!

354
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,041
Yeah. I know how I look.

355
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,583
Just ignore me.
I'm not mad at you.

356
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,875
Or you, Fuzzy.

357
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,375
We help them and this
is how she treats us?

358
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,750
Where does she get off
talking down to us like that?

359
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:34,208
Yeah, I get she's a skeptic, but
she doesn't have to be so rude!

360
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,500
[ABENO sighs]

361
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,125
Listen to me.

362
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,166
Being treated like a con artist
comes with the territory.

363
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,208
What are you saying?

364
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,750
This is an everyday thing?

365
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,750
Afraid so.

366
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,541
What do you expect of
people that can't see them?

367
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,541
Think you'd be patient with
someone trying to sell you

368
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,250
on invisible monsters?

369
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,208
[ASHIYA] So we just
stand there and take it?

370
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:56,833
But that's not fair.

371
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,208
How can you be
so chill about this?

372
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,750
Someone's rude to you
and you just ignore it?

373
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,125
I'm a lot less "chill"
about it than you think.

374
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,666
[ABENO]
What do you want?

375
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,416
Should I waste my time
worrying about what they say?

376
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,208
What? You want something?

377
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,875
There's no way you're
shrugging it off.

378
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,125
It has to get to you.

379
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,916
[ABENO]
What're you talking about?

380
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,666
The daughter thought
we were a trip.

381
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,250
The mother thought we
were a couple of frauds.

382
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,541
You can't just walk
away from that, right?

383
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:33,916
It's gotta sting a little.

384
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,541
Make you feel like an outcast.

385
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,125
[ABENO] Why is he such
a pain in the ass today?

386
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,375
Ashiya, stand up.

387
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:47,875
[ABENO]
Look, it's okay.

388
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,416
I've made my peace with it.

389
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,875
I'm in this to serve <i>yokai</i> .

390
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,708
Period.

391
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,708
Helping them is
good enough for me.

392
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,041
[ASHIYA]
He means it.

393
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,750
When I was in the Underworld,

394
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:10,500
the Legislator asked if I could
give myself mind, body, and soul

395
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,208
to serve <i>yokai</i> .

396
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,958
I didn't have an answer for him.

397
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:18,875
But for Abeno, the
answer's clear as day.

398
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,791
He couldn't care less
what people think.

399
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,000
We're in the same business.

400
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:28,041
But even so,
in situations like this,

401
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,208
when you get right down to it,

402
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,958
Abeno and I are complete
and total opposites.

403
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,083
[ASHIYA]
Heads up! Here it comes!

404
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,916
[ASHIYA]
That woman got under my skin.

405
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,958
I'm still kinda ticked.

406
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,541
Doesn't bother me as much when
I'm playing with Fuzzy, though.

407
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,458
[ASHIYA] Maybe this is what it
feels like to be in it for them.

408
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,750
How Abeno copes.

409
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,958
[ASHIYA laughs]

410
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,750
[MITSUCHIGURA] All the more
reason to proceed with caution.

411
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,958
Ashiya is dangerous.

412
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,791
[ABENO]
Yeah. He might be right.

413
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,833
Not because Ashiya's afraid,

414
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,541
but because he's letting
himself get too attached.

415
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,541
[phone ringing]

416
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:24,500
[ASHIYA]
Sorry, Fuzzy.

417
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,625
Give me a sec.

418
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,250
Hey, what's up?

419
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,250
Sure, I can talk.

420
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,958
What's going on?

421
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,916
Yeah, he's here.

422
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,916
We're still at school, actually.

423
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,125
No, nothing today.

424
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah. Uh-huh.

425
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,958
Yahiko's in trouble?

426
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:49,000
Right. Got it. Hold on.

427
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,083
Hey, boss.

428
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,333
Zenko's got a problem.

429
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,875
Wants to know if we can
come to the temple ASAP.

430
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,625
Tell her yes.

431
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,125
[ABENO] Yahiko insist on
being difficult, or what?

432
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,291
[ASHIYA]
I dunno.

433
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,708
That's not what it
sounded like to me.

434
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,125
[doorbell rings]

435
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,916
[ANNOUNCER] Lovely weather
across the country today.

Unfortunately,
clouds are moving in.

437
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,458
We've got rain in
the forecast tonight,

438
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,083
starting around 8 PM
for the northern districts,

Some areas can expect
to see up to three inches..

441

You're those two clowns
from the other day.

442
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,791
[ASHIYA]
Is this how we die?

443
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,250
I'm glad they made
it here quickly.

444
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,750
[NOBUO]
Thank you!

445
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,208
I've had so much fun!

446
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:51,708
I can't begin to tell you
how marvelous it's been!

447
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:55,666
Nothing compares to
the happiness I felt!

448
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,916
Thank you.

449
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,333
Thank you!

450
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,166
[ASHIYA]
Abeno! I did it!

451
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,375
I taught myself how to write
your name in calligraphy!

452
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,291
[ABENO]
Good for you.

453
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,541
[ASHIYA]
Aren't you impressed?

454
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,625
My handwriting's better
than the Mononokean's!

455
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:41,916
[ABENO] Tell you what:
next to my name,

456
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,375
write "wants to bash
my skull in with a rock."

457
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:46,250
[ASHIYA]
Wait, what for?
