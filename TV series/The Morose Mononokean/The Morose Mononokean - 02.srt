1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,625
[FEMALE STUDENT 2A]
Sit with me at lunch?

2
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:11,750
[FEMALE STUDENT 2B]
Sure!

3
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:15,291
[ASHIYA] Can't believe he
slept all the way through

4
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:16,875
fourth period.

5
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:18,833
Oh, hey. You're awake.

6
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,041
It's lunchtime.

7
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,875
Don't try to play it all cool!

8
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,458
You knew were we classmates
and didn't say squat!

9
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,666
Yeah? So?

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,708
[ASHIYA]
You might've clued me in.

11
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:29,750
Huh?

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,041
Is that a <i>yokai</i> ?

13
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:38,250
'Kay. So I'm guessing I
can see all of them now.

14
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,625
You gonna exorcise
it now or later?

15
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,666
Not unless someone hires me to.

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,000
Wouldn't stay in
business very long

17
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,250
if I ran around
doing it for free.

18
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,833
Yeah, but I thought
you said <i>yokai</i> belong

19
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:48,750
in the Underworld.

20
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,166
We can't just leave him here.

21
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,833
He'll wander the earth forever.

22
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,000
It isn't right to
turn a blind eye.

23
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,375
[gasps]

24
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,708
I hired you to
make life easier.

25
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,041
That means you ignore
any <i>yokai</i> you come across

26
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:03,083
unless I expressly
say otherwise, got it?

27
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,458
Right. Moving on.

28
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:07,375
Go buy me some tea
and cod roe rice balls.

29
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,208
[ASHIYA]
So I'm his errand boy?

30
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,041
[ASHIYA] Why can't he
get his own lunch?

31
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,750
Whatever. If it
pays off my debt, fine.

32
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,458
[ASHIYA]
Ugh. No...

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,791
Aw, man. Should've gone
to the convenience store.

34
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,041
[FEMALE STUDENT 2C gasps]

35
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,916
You all right?
Is something the matter?

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,916
My leg just went numb.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,291
It won't move.

38
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,000
[FEMALE STUDENT 2E]
Should we get the nurse?

39
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,208
[FEMALE STUDENT 2D]
You roll your ankle?

40
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,291
[FEMALE STUDENT 2C]
No. But it hurts.

41
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,750
[ABENO] Ignore any <i>yokai</i>
you come across.

42
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,125
[MALE STUDENT 2A]
She okay?

43
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,666
[FEMALE STUDENT 2D]
No. She can't move her leg.

44
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,500
[MALE STUDENT 2B] Whoa!
We should call an ambulance!

45
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,666
[ASHIYA]
Dang it.

46
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,125
I can't ignore this!

47
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,166
What the--?

48
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,791
I can move it.

49
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,041
How did you--?

50
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,250
You should be good
from here on out, I think.

51
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,541
But stop by the nurse's
just in case.

52
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,500
[FEMALE STUDENT 2C]
Uh...

53
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,791
Sure thing, thanks.

54
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,166
[MALE STUDENT 2A]
What happened?

55
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,958
This guy fixed her leg using
nothing but his hand!

56
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,833
Seriously? He's a healer!

57
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,166
Wow!

58
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,416
Someone in our school has
magical healing powers!

59
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,250
[ASHIYA] I want nothing
to do with <i>yokai</i> ,

60
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,875
but how am I supposed to
pretend they're not around?

61
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,541
[ASHIYA]
Why do I have the chills?

62
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,375
I know this feeling.

63
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,500
It's like when the
fuzz ball latched onto me.

64
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:10,208
Except this is way
more... terrifying.

65
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,791
[ANT screams]

66
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,291
The heck is that noise?!

67
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,916
[screaming continues]

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,791
[ASHIYA] Am I the only
one who hears it?

69
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,333
[ANTS chittering]

70
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,583
[ABENO]
By all means, take your time.

71
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,666
[ASHIYA screams]

72
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,708
[FEMALE STUDENT 2I]
What's up with him?

73
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:33,875
[FEMALE STUDENT 2H]
No idea.

74
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,375
That's loud. Jeez.

75
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,250
Abeno.

76
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,833
[ASHIYA whimpering]

77
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,000
[ASHIYA]
Please! You have to help me!

78
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,125
What did I tell you
not ten minutes ago?!

79
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,750
What the hell are you doing?!

80
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,208
Remember when I said I
hired you to make life easier?

81
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,916
[ASHIYA]
I know! I'm sorry!

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,291
Unbelievable!

83
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,875
Of all the things to get
yourself possessed by...

84
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,166
Excuse us, ladies.

85
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,416
[FEMALE STUDENT 2I]
Oh, but...

86
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,041
Mononokean, come!

87
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,666
[rattling noise]

88
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,333
[ASHIYA gasps]

89
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,875
[ASHIYA]
What the--? Knock it off!

90
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,625
You're choking me!

91
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:22,791
[ABENO]
Son of a--

92
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,625
Deal with it!

93
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,000
Hey! Listen!

94
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,750
I need you to get your
fingertips inside the door!

95
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,250
Wait, seriously?

96
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,500
That's it?

97
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,750
[ANTS chittering]

98
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,958
[grunting]

99
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,125
[ANTS chittering]

100
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,166
[ASHIYA]
It worked!

101
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,083
Go in. While you can.

102
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,333
It's the tearoom.

103
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,958
The same one from yesterday!

104
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,458
[ANTS chittering]

105
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:55,750
Oh. All right.

106
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,000
[ABENO]
Door's closing.

107
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,291
Move it or lose it.

108
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:03,958
That was a close one.

109
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,083
You're not out of
the woods yet, genius.

110
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,791
The second you set foot
outside this room,

111
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,333
they'll dog-pile you again.

112
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,916
Aw, c'mon!

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,250
But I was finally getting to be
a normal high school student!

114
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,833
[ABENO]
Take off your shoes.

115
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,000
[ASHIYA]
Hang on...

116
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,458
Summon that sliding door again.

117
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,458
That'll lead 'em to
the Underworld, won't it?

118
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,916
--Not possible.
--[ASHIYA] How come?

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,666
Well, not that it's
any of your business,

120
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,833
but I'm only able to open
the door to the Underworld

121
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,000
twice a day.

122
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,125
So there's nothing we can do?

123
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,208
[ABENO]
What do you want from me?

124
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,375
They're a swarm.

125
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,583
It'd take days to
exorcise all of them.

126
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,875
I only have so much strength.

127
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,833
[ASHIYA] Those things are gonna
chase me the rest of my life?

128
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,458
[ABENO]
Calm down.

129
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,375
We have options.

130
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,875
So there's hope?

131
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,166
[ABENO] They pack more of
a wallop than you'd expect,

132
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,583
small as they are.

133
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,333
They're young,
but they're strong.

134
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,875
Like worker ants.

135
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,666
[ASHIYA] Does that mean
there's like a "queen ant"

136
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,791
calling the shots?

137
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,333
Exactly.

138
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,458
And they were trying you to
take you to the big boss's nest.

139
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,291
Give it something to feed on.

140
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,375
[ASHIYA]
Feed?

141
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,750
Maybe. Just an educated guess.

142
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,541
I won't know what
the boss <i>yokai</i> wants

143
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,500
till I meet it face-to-face.

144
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,500
I need you to
stay here for now.

145
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,625
If you get eaten, I'll be SOL.

146
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,375
I'm not about to lose
the money you owe me.

147
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,833
[ASHIYA]
Whoa! Wait a minute!

148
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:20,875
[ABENO]
Calm down.

149
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,250
Lunch will have to wait.

150
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,250
No, no!

151
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,541
That isn't it!

152
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,833
You're gonna try to exorcise
the boss <i>yokai</i> all by yourself?

153
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,708
[ABENO] You ever want to leave
this room again, I have to.

154
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,708
[ASHIYA]
I don't think you should.

155
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:36,958
What?

156
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,208
Are you listening to me?
It's your only way out!

157
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,458
[ASHIYA]
But what if you get eaten?

158
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,583
I could never forgive myself
if you died because of me!

159
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,125
I'd have to transfer
to a whole other school!

160
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,416
[ABENO]
He's scared out of his mind.

161
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,083
Well... all things considered,
I can't blame him.

Fine, then. Use me as bait.

[ASHIYA]
I can distract the little ones

we have a lot more in
common than you might think.

191

And besides, this whole

I have a responsibility.

I can't let you

Cursed, the Underworld calls it.

323
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,041
Here, we'd say an
incurable disease.

324
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,208
I've accepted my fate.

325
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:44,500
So long as the little ones
made it to the Underworld.

326
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,458
My only wish was to
see my children thrive

327
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,875
before I withered away.

328
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,166
I am most grateful
for your help.

329
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,125
Now I may die in peace.

330
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,458
[ASHIYA] Do the little ones know
you're not coming with them?

331
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,750
[BIG BOSS SCREE]
No.

332
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,708
I didn't want to
worry them unduly.

333
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,333
[ASHIYA]
Uh-uh.

334
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:08,708
No! You're going!

335
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,833
Even if I have to cut
these roots myself!

336
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,416
What? Ah!

337
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,791
Don't be stupid!
They're not normal roots!

338
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,625
Chop 'em off, they
grow back instantly!

339
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:17,875
Then I'll find another way!

340
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,333
I'm not just gonna stand
there and let him die!

341
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,458
[ABENO] What's gotten
into him all of a sudden?

342
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,000
He was scared out
of his mind before.

343
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,583
You can't abandon your children.

344
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:28,916
[BIG BOSS SCREE]
Ki?

345
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,250
You know they'll
be waiting for you

346
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,583
in the Underworld.

347
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:32,833
For crying out loud,

348
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,833
you didn't even give them
a proper goodbye!

349
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,958
You wanna leave them
hanging like that?

350
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:41,333
Child, do not speak as
though you understand me.

351
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,750
The little ones were
my reason for living.

352
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,375
I'd tear myself limb from
limb to be with them.

353
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,375
Endure anything without
a second thought.

354
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:55,166
Alas, it is not possible
for me to join them.

355
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,208
I must be content with
seeing them on their way.

356
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,458
Such is my fate.

357
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,583
Though, if I had one more wish,

358
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,458
it would be to be their guardian
until they are big enough

359
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,875
to fend for themselves.

360
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,750
But that hope I must abandon.

361
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,083
But you...

362
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:20,875
[ASHIYA]
Now what?

363
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,458
[ABENO]
If you'd really endure anything,

364
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,291
there might be a way
to get you there.

365
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,208
It's a long shot, though.

366
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:33,791
Whoa. What is that?

367
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,125
Think of it as a pill.

368
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,166
Swallow it and the parasite
shrub will be weakened.

369
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,625
Huh?

370
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,375
Could you maybe have said
something about this before?

371
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,208
The catch is, the
agony it'll cause you

372
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,083
is beyond imagination.

373
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,708
Pain so great, some people
have even died from it.

374
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,583
[ABENO]
Still interested?

375
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,708
[BIG BOSS SCREE]
Ki.

376
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,791
Is it possible?

377
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,541
[BIG BOSS SCREE] I would be with
my children whatever the cost.

378
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,916
Until my body withers to dust.

379
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,750
Mononokean Master Abeno.

380
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:12,833
Please.

381
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,333
Send me to the Underworld!

382
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,875
Sure, if that's
what you really want.

383
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,250
[BIG BOSS SCREE groaning]

384
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:39,416
Ki! Ki! Ki!

385
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,625
[BIG BOSS SCREE]
Ki! It burns!

386
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:56,541
Ki! Ki ki ki ki!

387
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,583
[screaming continues]

388
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,625
He's more manageable
this way, I'll give you that.

389
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,000
Partially due to
the medicine, of course.

390
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,125
But also because the
anxiety that made him grow

391
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,875
so large in the
first place is gone.

392
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,750
Now...

393
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,875
Either he'll wake up
or he won't.

394
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,916
Depends on how strong he is.

395
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,166
Big Boss Scree!

396
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,625
--You're okay! Thank goodness!
--[yelling]

397
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,875
Ashiya! Knock it off!

398
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,875
Oh! I'm sorry!

399
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,166
[ABENO]
He's strong enough to scream.

400
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,500
I'm impressed.

401
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,375
Forgive the inconvenience.

402
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,125
My children are worried.

403
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,541
I should be getting
on my way now.

404
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,583
Can you move on your own, or...?

405
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,458
I'll take a little while,
but I'll be fine.

406
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,625
[ABENO]
They waited.

407
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,041
Been right here
this whole time.

408
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,458
Glad you didn't give up?

409
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,541
[ANTS chittering]

410
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,958
Well, what do you know?

411
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,583
Very glad.

412
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,208
Very glad indeed.

413
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,750
[BIG BOSS SCREE] I cannot
express my gratitude enough.

414
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,625
You are a hero, my friend.

415
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,500
The name Abeno will ring far
and wide in the Underworld!

416
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,958
[ABENO] I hope not!
I'm swamped as it is!

417
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,708
Besides...

418
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,166
I've done absolutely nothing
to earn your gratitude.

419
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,541
At the end of the day all
I did was give you a pill,

420
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,583
but it was your strength
that did the heavy lifting.

421
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,166
I'm the Mononokean Master.

422
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,750
I should've been
able to do more.

423
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,166
Forgive me.

424
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,583
I needed help.

425
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,791
That's what you gave me.

426
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,375
So thank you.

427
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,375
You've done well.

428
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,916
Time to go, little ones.

429
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,708
Let's be on our way.

430
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,333
[ASHIYA]
Wait! I didn't...

431
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,000
I owe you an apology!

432
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,208
[BIG BOSS SCREE]
Hm?

433
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,250
[ASHIYA] It was wrong
of me to talk to you

434
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,500
the way I did.

435
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,541
I shouldn't have
questioned your devotion.

436
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,208
I shouldn't have been so quick
to want to chop off your roots.

437
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,625
[BIG BOSS SCREE]
Hey! That's enough!

438
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,333
Hang on.

439
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,541
You were going on what you knew.
I was way too harsh.

440
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:32,333
I had no right to call you out.

441
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,166
I'm sorry.

442
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,583
[BIG BOSS SCREE]
Ki ki ki.

443
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:41,375
If you hadn't said what you did,
I might not be here.

00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,750
Ki ki ki.

445
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,250
Oh, yeah, right.

446
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,333
There's an apothecary in the
Underworld called Kiyakudo.

447
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,416
The master's a bit
on the eccentric side,

448
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,416
but you should visit
it while you're there.

449
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,458
It's definitely
worth the journey.

450
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,166
[BIG BOSS SCREE]
A recommendation from you

451
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,958
is good enough for me.

00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:01,875
Ki ki ki!

453
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,291
Well, friends.

454
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,375
We must part ways.

Farewell, Abeno!

Farewell.

458
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,041
Glad that's over with.

459
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,500
I feel like all I really did
was sit on the sidelines

460
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,166
and scream my head off.

461
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,125
Shut up, that's not true.

462
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,625
Look, if it hadn't been for you,

463
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,166
he wouldn't have even
asked for my help.

464
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,333
I would've never given
him the pill on my own.

465
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,416
It's because you got him
talking about his children

466
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,458
that I decided to do something.

467
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,375
I'm not the courageous type.

00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,583
I hope I do okay.

No worries.

Gee, thanks!
