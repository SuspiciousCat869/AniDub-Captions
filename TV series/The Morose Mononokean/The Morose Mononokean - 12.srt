1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,000
It's been a while.

2
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,041
Or has it?

3
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:19,083
Rather hard to believe you came
here without being summoned.

4
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,041
This must be
extremely important.

5
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,125
It's just some housekeeping.

6
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:28,583
I thought you should know...
that I released my employee.

7
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,208
[LEGISLATOR]
Hmm...

8
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:04,458
As the master, you are free
to terminate whomever.

9
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:08,041
Just the same as when you made
the choice to hire the boy.

10
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:10,000
[ABENO] But you were
upset that I'd hired him

11
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:14,416
without informing you before,
so I'm keeping you in the loop.

12
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,166
After all, isn't that
what I should be doing?

13
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,250
Should be doing?

14
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,708
Hmm...

15
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,500
Ah, come now.

16
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,125
It's not as though
you're especially known

17
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,208
for your adherence to protocol.

18
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,916
[grumbles]

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,375
Sorry for bothering you.

20
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,583
Can't I hear the
rest of the story?

21
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,291
There has to be more to it.

22
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:39,208
At the very least,
the reason he was let go.

23
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,916
He's lost his ability
to see <i>yokai</i> .

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,541
So say the rumors.

25
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,708
[ABENO]
Yes.

26
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,875
And that's all?

27
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,791
[ABENO]
That's reason enough for me.

28
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,291
If he can't see or hear them,

29
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,250
he can't effectively
help the Mononokean

30
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,000
complete the jobs we take.

31
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,333
We need someone who can.

32
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,250
Yes, but I've also heard

33
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,958
that he temporarily
lent his sight

34
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,833
to a <i>yokai</i> who was in need.

35
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,208
So your decision to fire him
seems a bit rash in my opinion.

36
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,500
What was supposed
to last a few days

37
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,541
has turned into a week now.

38
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,750
The work coming in hasn't slowed
down since that happened.

39
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,875
I simply don't have
the time to wait.

40
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,583
"As long as it's
not an official rule,

41
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,333
I'm not going to fire him."

42
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,458
Does that sound at all familiar?

43
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,333
If I recall, you said that
last time we spoke face to face.

44
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,750
The situation has changed.

45
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:26,916
Itsuki.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,750
Do you regret your decision?

47
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,333
Huh?

48
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,708
Do you regret hiring him?

49
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,166
[gasps]

50
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,125
[LEGISLATOR] Now you can put
all those doubts to rest.

51
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,541
Is that not what
you were thinking?

52
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,583
Not exactly.

53
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,000
He's too emotionally
invested in <i>yokai</i> .

54
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,625
And it got in the
way of his duties.

55
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:49,708
I know from experience the
mistakes that can lead to,

56
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,916
so I took action before
things got worse.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,583
[LEGISLATOR]
So it's in his best interest

58
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:57,583
if he doesn't regain the
ability to perceive <i>yokai</i> .

59
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,208
I understand why
you would relate

60
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,916
the struggle he's going
through to your own.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,375
You don't want him
to have to endure

62
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,083
the hardships
you've gone through.

63
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,708
[grumbles]

64
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,291
Ah.

65
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,875
I honestly had no idea you cared
for your "employee" so deeply.

66
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,583
Eh? Uh?

67
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,916
Cut it out.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,708
I agree that you have
every right to let him go.

69
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,458
But have you even
considered the argument

70
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,000
that he has every right to stay?

71
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,583
How did he take it?

72
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,000
Did he accept your choice
without argument?

73
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,083
Or did he fight back?

74
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,000
[ABENO]
Doesn't matter if he accepts it.

75
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,041
I'm the master and I
did what I had to do.

76
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,375
I have to ask.

77
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,583
Does Ashiya come
from a large family?

78
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,208
Huh?

79
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,708
All he's really said about them
is his mom runs a flower shop,

80
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,083
and that his sister stays
out partying all night.

81
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,125
[LEGISLATOR]
And his father?

82
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,916
Actually, no mention of him.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,333
Are you trying to make a point?

84
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,416
I just find it interesting

85
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,000
that he's a human named Ashiya

86
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,083
who happens to possess
the ability to see <i>yokai</i> .

87
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,000
Did that have nothing
to do with his hiring?

88
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,583
Maybe you should exercise
a little patience with him.

89
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,791
[ABENO] Well, he doesn't
have the ability anymore.

90
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:06,208
And that gets in the way
of exorcising <i>yokai</i> .

91
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,041
It is my decision as the master.

92
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,833
[phone ringing]

93
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:14,875
[LEGISLATOR]
Hm?

94
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:18,833
Hello?

95
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:19,708
[SHIZUKU]
Brother!

96
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,291
Greetings, Shizuku.

97
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,333
Are you calling to tell me
you're coming home?

98
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,375
[SHIZUKU] No! I was trying
to get a hold of Itsuki.

99
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,500
Is he still there?

100
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,125
He is. Want to speak with him?

101
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,375
[ASHIYA] He didn't come
to school again today.

102
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,833
Is he dealing with
a difficult job?

103
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,708
Maybe with a
really scary <i>yokai</i> .

104
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:46,916
Whoa, calm down!

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,125
Uh. Sorry.

106
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,125
So did you remember
to bring your camera?

107
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,291
Yeah, of course.

108
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,250
I found an old one
we had at home.

109
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,875
That should do the trick.

110
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,000
Are you gonna join
the photography club?

111
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,250
I don't know, but I'm gonna
check it out at least.

112
00:05:59,333 --> 00:05:59,916
[SAGA]
Oh, cool.

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,333
[FUSSHI]
Mh-hm.

114
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,291
--[CAT meows]
--[FUSSHI yelps]

115
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,541
Ah, flower pic. I'm glad to
see you're gettin' into it.

116
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:20,750
Yeah, guess I am.

117
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,208
You've got a natural
eye for framing, man.

118
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,750
I think you should take some
more pictures on the way home

119
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:29,250
and see if you find something
you've never noticed before.

120
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,583
[ASHIYA] I've only taken
souvenir pictures,

121
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,333
but I'm really starting
to like photography.

122
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,875
Wish I could get
some pics of <i>yokai</i> .

123
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,083
[sighs]

124
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,125
[ASHIYA yelps]

125
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,541
[ASHIYA]
You startled me.

126
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,208
So what's the deal with
the camera? Photography club?

127
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,291
I wasn't really
thinking about it,

128
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,166
but I could totally
see myself joining.

129
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,375
Why? Did you quit your job?

130
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:14,583
I didn't exactly "quit."
Abeno fired me.

131
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,458
Because you can't see
any <i>yokai</i> anymore?

132
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,916
I see. Yahiko told you about it.

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
[ZENKO]
Mh-hm.

134
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,916
And I thought of
something you could try.

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,208
Well, what's your idea?

136
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,375
I used to not be
able to see them,

137
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,583
but I could after Yahiko bit me.

138
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:35,875
So there's no reason why that
wouldn't work for you, right?

139
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,416
That's a great idea!

140
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,250
Yeah! Let's go back to your
place right now and try it out!

141
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,625
It's just me.

142
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,916
[ASHIYA] I'm staring
to rethink this idea.

143
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,333
Coming home with Zenko
means I have to see her dad.

144
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,500
Zenko. You're awfully
late coming home.

145
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,000
[ASHIYA]
He was waiting on her?!

146
00:07:59,083 --> 00:07:59,666
It's you.

147
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,041
[ASHIYA]
Ah! Sorry!

148
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,583
I have a perfectly good
reason for being here, sir!

149
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,250
[ZENKO'S DAD]
I'm glad to see you again.

150
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,416
Come in, make yourself at home.

151
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,875
Uh, sir. I'm awfully sorry for
coming to your home so late.

152
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,125
[ZENKO'S DAD] I was just
thinking about asking Zenko

153
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,541
to invite you over.

154
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,500
Oh. You were?

155
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,875
I was.

156
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,375
I have been considering
accepting exorcism requests

157
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,416
at the temple.

158
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,458
Huh?

159
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,958
This is no mere coincidence,

160
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,291
you just showing up
when I had that idea.

161
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,083
It's because you're
psychic, aren't you?

162
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,291
Ha! And it seems
you've read my mind.

163
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,083
I didn't! I can't
read anyone's mind.

164
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,958
[ZENKO'S DAD] Now I haven't
gotten any requests yet,

165
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:42,166
but when I do, you'll be the
first one to know, Ashida.

166
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,750
It's Ashiya, sir.

167
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,041
And it wouldn't do you
any good to count on me.

168
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,333
[ZENKO'S DAD]
Oh, right.

169
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,583
See?

170
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,208
I even had some postcards made

171
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,708
so I could start spreading
the word about it.

172
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,125
[ASHIYA] "Parishioners troubled
by hauntings, curses,

173
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,666
and all other manner of
supernatural phenomena,

174
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,166
we are now open
for consultations.

175

This temple is partnered
with a talented psychic."

176

[yelps]

177
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,625
Sorry, but you've got
the wrong idea about me.

178
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:10,333
I'm telling you, I am not
a psychic. I see <i>yokai</i> .

179
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,541
Uh.

180
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,375
[ASHIYA] Actually, I guess I
should say I used to see <i>yokai</i> .

181
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,708
Don't you worry.

182
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,625
I promise I'll pay you
a decent wage for it.

183
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,875
Yeah! That's not the
problem here! My point is--

184
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,166
Hey, Dad?

185
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,208
[ASHIYA] Whew! I'm saved
from this living hell!

186
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,166
Although it's kinda strange
to say that about a priest.

187
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,750
[ZENKO]
That's enough.

188
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,458
Hanae came over here because
we have something to talk about.

189
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,041
And what do you
two have to discuss?

190
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,291
[ASHIYA]
Uh! A priest from hell!

191
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,041
[ZENKO]
C'mon, let's go.

192
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,458
Hey, hold on Masuda!

193
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,833
You better not get any weird
ideas about my daughter!

194
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,125
My name's Ashiya.

195
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,416
And speaking of weird,
that wasn't even close.

196
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,375
If you don't stop being
rude to my friends,

197
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,666
I'm gonna tell Mom about it.

198
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,083
What?! No!

199
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,875
I'm just worried about my
little baby girl, is all!

200
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,166
Don't worry, and I'm not
a baby. Just try to relax.

201
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,375
She's right, there is
nothing to worry about.

202
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,416
If someone hires us
for an exorcism,

203
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,041
I'll have him come
back over to help.

204
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,250
[ZENKO'S DAD]
You will?!

205
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,291
[ASHIYA]
Uh.

206
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,000
'Kay, go ahead and
put out your arm.

207
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,791
Is Yahiko around or something?

208
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,041
[ZENKO]
Mh-hm.

209
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,500
He's right behind me.

210
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,333
Why do I have to help this jerk?

211
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,083
I haven't forgiven him for
hitting me with his shoe.

212
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,750
[ZENKO]
Just bite him would you?

213
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,708
I'll give you more
candy if you do.

214
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,500
Aww!

215
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,000
Okay, ten pieces of Rakugan.

216
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,166
It's a deal.

217
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,083
All right then!
That works for me!

218
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,416
Well, there you go.

219
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,625
The bite. Did it work?

220
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,375
Thanks for trying.

221
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:56,166
I'm sorry.

222
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,291
I thought that would do it.

223
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,125
[SHIZUKU]
Hey! Itsuki!

224
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,000
Something wrong?

225
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,625
I was afraid you'd left already.

226
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,500
I was just on my way out.

227
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,000
What's up? What do
you need from me?

228
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,791
[SHIZUKU]
There's someone at the shop.

229
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,458
He's asking to meet with you.

230
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:25,041
Why would somebody be
asking for me at Kiyakudo?

231
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,958
[SHIZUKU] You'll understand
when you see him.

233
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,583

Ki, ki, ki. Hello, Abeno.

236
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,291
What a nice surprise.

237
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,458
I wanted to thank you
again for your help.

238

I hope that you're
feeling better.

[BIG BOSS SCREE]
Ki, ki.

Thanks to you and
these lovely creatures,

Yes, I'll tell him.

The little ones want
to say thanks as well.

247
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,666
Yes, of course.

248
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,500
Did Ashiya not come
here with you today?

249
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,500
No.

Now isn't that a shame?

We wanted to express our true
appreciation and gratitude

to both of you for
all that you've done.

If it weren't for your help,

255
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:28,375
well, I wouldn't be
here with my children.

256

I owe the both of you my life.

257
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,666
No. It was actually
Ashiya who saved you.

258
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,291
I don't deserve the credit.

I'm so happy that we
could catch you in time.

262
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,500
Big Boss came here right
after you left the shop.

263
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,250
So I called my big brother
as soon as I could.

Not a problem, sir.
You're a regular, after all!

You're so sweet.

Feel free to take the
rest of the day off.

Seriously?

270

[KOURA] You have been working
a lot of overtime lately.

be glad to see you.

Thank you! I'll see
ya later, Itsuki!

Yeah. See ya.

00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,541
Hopefully, you can bring
Ashiya along with you next time.

275
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,666
I'll think about it.

[SHIZUKU laughing]

00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:18,958
Well, Itsuki?

What?

279
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,125
It's just my intuition,

280
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,750
but something happened
with Ashiya, yes?

281
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,208
Huh?

282

I'm joking.

Now I see.

286
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,958
So that's why you sent Shizuku
home all of a sudden, isn't it?

287
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,750
Considering the she
doesn't even know

288
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,083
both you boys are human,

289
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,541
I thought it best to
discuss this without her.

[ABENO sighs]

291
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:47,416
I honestly wasn't trying to
hide this from you, but...

292
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,458
He can't see <i>yokai</i> anymore?

293
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,666
[BIG BOSS SCREE]
Ki, ki.

294
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,458
Isn't there some kind
of pill he can take?

295
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,791
Unfortunately, human
medicine is well beyond

296
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,916
my area of expertise.

297
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,833
I may be wrong, but he couldn't
always see <i>yokai</i> , correct?

298
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,583
He only gained the
ability to see them

299
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,750
after the hairball
possessed him.

300
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,875
But you're right, before that
he couldn't see them at all.

301
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,625
So there was something
that triggered it?

[BIG BOSS SCREE]
Ki, ki.

Why don't you look
for this Tomori

304
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,291
and find out what
she has to say?

305
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,000
That is an excellent idea,

306
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,583
but since she's new
to the Underworld,

307
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,458
she may be hard to find.

be able to find her,

Ashiya's no longer my employee.

313
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,583
That means he has nothing to do
with the Mononokean or <i>yokai</i> .

314
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,500
[BIG BOSS SCREE]

for Tomori myself.

I'm extremely fond

336
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,541
She was exorcised
by the Mononokean

a little over a week ago.

I can introduce you
to her if you'd like.

[ABENO]
My job is to help <i>yokai</i> .

348
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:27,500
Me asking for their help...
is just pathetic.

00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,125
[KOURA]  I'm sorry, love,
but you're wrong.

Although that is your
basic job description,

351
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,625
they specifically asked to help.

352
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:41,583
Because of what you and
Ashiya did for them, right?

353
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,750
But I've already fired Ashiya,

354
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,333
so even if we do find Tomori...

355
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,875
Come now.

356
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,416
Surely you'll agree that this
is an incredible situation.

Does all the screeching mean
they were able to locate her,

or that they weren't?

[NOBOU] They explained the
situation with Ashiya to me.

371
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:31,541
After hearing of his troubles,
I couldn't just stand idly by

and not do everything

Hey!

I heard that Ashiya is
in some kinda trouble!

375
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,125
There's a rumor going around
that he can't see us anymore.

376
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,375
Is that really true?

Yes, that is true.

That's horrible news.

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,250
Because if he hadn't seen
me in the first place,

I may never've been able to

Upon further reflection,

I realize now that my fears
were completely baseless.

387
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:12,500
In fact, we've all come together
due to our shared concern

and admiration for him.

00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:21,208
He may be a human,
but he's beloved by <i>yokai</i> .

00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,166
I wanted to hear some
of your thoughts on this.

400
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,666
In the past, those who
had lent me their vision

401
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,166
had theirs restored in no
more than two or three days.

402
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,083
[ABENO] Yes, that's exactly
what Okina told me.

403
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:04,500
If I knew this would happen,
I would have never accepted

404
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:07,458
Ashiya's generous offer
in the first place.

405
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,416
But I wonder...

406
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,833
Yes, what is it?

407
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,291
There may be another
factor in play.

408
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,916
Some reason why it's taking
so long for him in particular.

409
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,458
Oh yeah? What?

410
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,625
I can sense in him some
extremely powerful feelings

411
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,541
regarding we <i>yokai</i> as a whole.

412
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,791
And because his willingness
to help me was so strong,

413
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,583
it's very possible that
he's still subconsciously

414
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,125
holding on to that feeling.

415
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,750
That he's still willing
his vision away somehow.

416
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,791
That does seem likely.

417
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,166
[TOMORI]
However, I'm beginning to fear

418
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,583
that if Ashiya's condition
persists for much longer,

419
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,791
it may mean that he
will permanently lose

420
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,750
his ability to see
or hear <i>yokai</i> .

421
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,291
[ABENO gasps]

422
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:54,083
I'm very worried
about that, in fact.

423
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,666
[ABENO]
So am I.

424
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,666
Ashiya wasn't able to perceive
<i>yokai</i> until fairly recently,

425
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,416
so maybe he'll lose
it just as quickly.

426
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,208
It just breaks my heart.

427
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,708
And I can't help but feel
responsible for this situation.

428
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:12,416
I didn't consider any long
lasting results it may have.

429
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,208
If it were possible, I would
gladly give him my own eyes

430
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,666
in the hopes it could make up
for my selfishness, truly.

I feel so bad.

00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:30,583

right. Help him see again.

of way you can see again.
