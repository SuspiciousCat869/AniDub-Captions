1
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:11,625
You're those two
clowns from the other day.

2
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:13,750
[ABENO] Sorry if we caused
you any inconvenience.

3
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,166
You've got some kinda nerve.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,041
Anyone who makes my
daughter cry like that

5
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:18,625
oughta have their
face rearranged.

6
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,250
Oh, please don't hurt us!

7
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,583
We're only here because she
called and asked us to come.

8
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:23,750
[ZENKO'S DAD]
She called you?!

9
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,666
I'll delete her
number right now, sir!

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,458
[ZENKO]
You don't have to do that.

11
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:30,333
I really appreciate you
coming on such short notice.

12
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,000
Make yourselves at home.

13
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,583
Forgive the intrusion.

14
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,458
I can't believe you're letting
them back into our home!

15
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:38,875
Listen, Dad.

16
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,875
If you keep insisting on
being rude to my new friends,

17
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,791
Mom is gonna hear
about everything.

18
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,750
[ABENO]
So how is Yahiko?

19
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:49,416
[ZENKO] Well, he's definitely
got a lot of energy.

20
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:55,750
[YAHIKO] Haruitsuki,
will you help me, please?

21
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,333
I got stuck back here, somehow!

22
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,750
[ZENKO] I came home from
school and he was like this.

23
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,541
It is pretty common
for <i>yokai</i> to grow

24
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,666
when they're feeling
upset about something.

25
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,958
I wasn't upset!

26
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,625
I had just eaten some <i>rakugan</i> ,

27
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,208
and then laid down in the
sun to take a nice long nap,

28
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,208
and when I woke up
I was gigantic!

29
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,500
Now I can't get back to normal.

30
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,875
Did you do anything
else before your nap?

31
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,125
Like what?

32
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,541
Scavenge for food?

33
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:53,958
You take that back!

34
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,083
I had <i>rakugan</i> and some potatoes!

35
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:59,041
And I did not "scavenge" for
them, thank you very much!

36
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,250
What potatoes?

37
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,250
[YAHIKO] The potatoes
that I snitched earlier.

38
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,583
You think that sounds better?

39
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,708
It's a whole lot
worse if you ask me!

40
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,375
Yahiko, are these the potatoes
you were talking about?

41
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,375
I almost didn't see Fuzzy there.

42
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,583
It's kinda like he's
semi-transparent.

43
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,708
You can't see him
as well as us?

44
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,458
Well, I can see
Yahiko very clearly.

45
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,791
But Fuzzy's "fuzzy."

46
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,666
They smell like
the same ones to me.

47
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,625
Apparently, my dad ate some
of these for lunch as well.

48
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,291
But he's his usual self.

49
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,708
Whoa.

50
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,541
Honestly, I think the smell
would kill my appetite.

51
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,625
[ASHIYA]
Ugh!

52
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,125
Man, they stink!

53
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,583
That's gotta be one of the
worst things I've ever smelled

54
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,541
in my life!

55
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,833
It's not that bad to me.

56
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,041
Ooh. I love the smell.

57
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,166
Can I have another one?

58
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,416
No, you can't.

59
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,750
[YAHIKO]
Hey, Haruitsuki.

60
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,708
I guess I didn't notice before.

61
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,500
But they smell...

62
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,750
...kinda like <i>yokai</i> to me.

63
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,458
[YAHIKO] It's from the
dirt on the potatoes.

64
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,625
From the dirt?

65
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,833
My mom grew them
herself on a nearby farm

66
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,000
that she shares with one
of our parishioners.

67
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,416
Yeah?

68
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,625
Then we should probably
go there and check things out

69
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,666
for ourselves.

70
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,166
Don't you think?

71
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,000
That's fine, just close the
damn bag already, would ya?

72
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,041
I don't like the idea
of you going anywhere

73
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,291
with these guys.

74
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,500
I'm serious, young lady.
Do you hear me?

75
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,875
Of course I can hear you.

76
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,583
And we're going to the farm.

77
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,458
Ya know, I get
a real strong feeling

78
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,833
that your dad actually hates us.

79
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,875
Well, it would certainly be
a stretch to say he likes us.

80
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:40,458
I'm really sorry
about all of this.

81
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,708
For bothering you with
whatever's going on with Yahiko.

82
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,125
And for my dad being
a total jerk to you.

83
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,958
Look. We understand.

84
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,375
Your dad's just
worried about you

85
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,083
like any regular
dad would be.

86
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,875
And it's only because
he truly loves you.

87
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,250
So let's go.

88
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,041
You're not bothering us.

89
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,208
We wanna help
you out with Yahiko.

90
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,541
He's right.

91
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,958
And I'm sorry that Yahiko
is causing you trouble.

92
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,541
Taking care of it is
my responsibility.

93
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,250
We are all the
same age, right?

94
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,583
Or are you really an adult?

95
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,083
Well, I'm more of
an adult than you.

96
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,625
[ASHIYA] Oh, yeah, you think
I'm like a five-year-old!

97
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,125
[ZENKO]
I'm glad they're here.

98
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,666
Really? Is that so?

99
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,791
That's enough.

100
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,708
'Kay.

101
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,750
[ZENKO] I just hope that Dad
eventually starts warming up

102
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,083
to them someday.

103
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,375
[ASHIYA]
So this is your mom's farm?

104
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,208
[ZENKO]
Mm-hmm.

105
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,833
[ASHIYA]
It's so stinky.

106
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,875
How can any of the neighbors
put up with the stench?

107
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,291
[ABENO] We're probably
the only ones who see

108
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,666
or smell it like this.

109
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,875
[ASHIYA]
Just us?

110
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,625
[gasps]
Which means...

111
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,250
[ABENO]
Yep. I sense a <i>yokai</i> in there.

112
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,166
Then let's go in and find it.

113
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,833
You think your nose
will be able to handle it?

114
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,458
I'm cool.
I'll just hold my breath!

115
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,958
That's not a workable strategy.

116
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,791
It doesn't seem to
bother me as much.

117
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,750
So I guess that means
it's all up to me

118
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,416
to take care of this one.

119
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,125
[ABENO]
Not gonna happen.

120
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:05,875
What's Fuzzy doing?

121
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:06,958
Fuzzy?

122
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,875
[gasps] Fuzzy!

123
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,208
You're getting mud all
over your beautiful fur!

124
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,500
[ASHIYA]
You're covered in it!

125
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,875
This means I'll have
to bathe you later! Aww...

126
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,916
And that's not the only thing.

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,458
I think he's getting bigger.

128
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,166
[ASHIYA yelps]

129
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,583
How did he get so heavy?

130
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,000
He'll crush me!

131
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,541
Looks like it's a
fairly safe assumption

132
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,541
that the mud is what made
Yahiko get so big, too.

133
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,833
How can we make him
cuddle-sized again?

134
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,250
Will you please wait around
here with the hairball?

135
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,291
[ZENKO]
Mm-hmm.

136
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,708
[ABENO]
All right, Ashiya, let's go.

137
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:41,750
Okay.

138
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,958
[ASHIYA coughing]
It stinks! So bad!

139
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,416
Cut it out!

140
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,083
The stench is just so much
worse than it was out there.

141
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,208
[coughing]

142
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,666
[ABENO]
The stench was enough.

143
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,333
Now I have the most annoying
soundtrack to go with it.

144
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,500
[pounding noise]

145
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,416
Do you hear that?

146
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,458
[pounding continues]

147
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,291
[NOBOU yowling]
It hurts!

148
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,791
He's hitting himself?

149
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,500
Hey, stop that!

150
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,458
You'll kill yourself if you
keep bashing your face in

151
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,458
with that rock!

152
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,958
[NOBOU]
A human?

153
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,583
Are you trying to kill yourself?

154
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,500
[NOBOU] Don't jump to
conclusions like that!

155
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,083
You got the wrong idea!

156
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,708
Anyway, that's not a rock!

157
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,708
[ABENO]
It's a potato.

158
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,916
Potatoes again?

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,833
[NOBOU] We are on a
potato farm, you know.

160
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,583
Well, it still
doesn't make sense!

161
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,916
[NOBOU] Oh, dear.
It seems I've been scolded.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,291
But that's quite all right!

163
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,166
It's been so long since
I've spoken a word to anybody!

164
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,416
And my very first time
to speak with a human!

165
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,583
Please allow me
to introduce myself.

166
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,791
My name is Nobou,
at your service.

167
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,625
And who might you gentlemen be?

168
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,750
My name's Abeno.
From the Mononokean.

169
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,166
I'm his assistant, Ashiya.

170
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,458
[NOBOU gasps]
The Mononokean?

171
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,958
So the rumors are true?

172
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,375
Rumors?

173
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,541
[NOBOU] That you're
the <i>yokai</i> kidnappers!

174
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,333
You entice <i>yokai</i>
over and over again

175
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,208
and drag them
to the Underworld!

176
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,333
Not exactly.

177
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,166
We exorcise <i>yokai</i> .

178
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,541
But... You're not
entirely wrong.

179
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,208
It depends on your perspective.

180
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,500
[NOBOU]
So you are kidnappers?

181
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,958
We have never kidnapped anybody!

182
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,416
I hope they're okay in there.

183
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,375
[NOBOU] I see, you just
call it something else,

184
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,166
but it's basically kidnapping.

185
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,291
[ASHIYA] No, it's not
anything like that at all!

186
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,625
[NOBOU] I don't care
what you call it.

187
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,041
I'll go to the Underworld!

188
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,083
As long as you get me out
of this place, I'm happy!

189
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,458
I've been stuck here
as long as I can remember.

190
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,083
No matter what I try,
I can't seem to escape!

191
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,708
I'd do anything if
I could just leave!

192
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:49,583
Oh, dear.

193
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,291
[ASHIYA]
Ugh! It stinks!

194
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,958
[ABENO] Nobou, do you know
what the deal is with this mud?

195
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,416
[NOBOU]
I don't know the reason why,

196
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,250
but it just started welling
up from the ground one day

197
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,458
without any warning.

198
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:59,958
When I try to walk through it.

199
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,583
I grow more and more
depressed and despondent,

200
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,500
and I lose every bit
of energy I have in me.

201
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,166
Eventually, I'm too
tired to even move.

202
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,458
[ASHIYA]
Nobou!

203
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,791
[NOBOU] I become completely
enveloped in smoke

204
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,833
and I'm trapped in
a waking nightmare.

205
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,875
A phantasmagoria.

206
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,833
Next thing,
I find myself back here.

207
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,125
You have visions?

208
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,208
[NOBOU] In order to stop
seeing such things.

209
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,166
I tried to erase my memory
by hitting myself in the head.

210
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,291
That's what you were
doing with the potato?

211
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,416
[NOBOU] I've tried practically
everything by this point,

212
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,000
and I'd given up
all hope of escape.

213
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,666
But if you send me
to the Underworld,

214
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,375
I will finally have the
freedom that I've been

215
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,625
so desperately longing for.

216
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,958
Come, Mononokean!

217
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,750
Send me to the Underworld
as quickly as you can!

218
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:43,166
I can't right now. I'm sorry.

219
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,333
[NOBOU]
Oh, dear.

220
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,916
It's happening again.

221
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,208
We've gotta do something!

222
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,250
The smell is killing me.

223
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,125
I can't stay focused enough
to open up a portal.

224
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,750
[coughing]

225
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,875
So. Our first priority is
getting you out of this field

226
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,166
to somewhere that I can actually
think a little more clearly.

227
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,833
[NOBOU] But I told you
what happens when I walk

228
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,291
through the mud!

229
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,666
Yes, I remember.

230
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,791
[ASHIYA]
Heave-ho.

231
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,541
[ASHIYA] You should be fine if
you're not actually touching it.

232
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,958
[NOBOU laughing]

233
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,791
[ASHIYA]
Okay, here we go!

234
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,083
[NOBOU]
Thank you!

235
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,625
[ASHIYA coughs]

236
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,750
[NOBOU] We're still in
the thick of the smoke.

237
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,916
You're right.

238
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,583
It doesn't make any
kind of sense to me.

239
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,833
[ABENO] I was already having
trouble with the horrible smell.

240
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,500
And now, the smoke
has gotten so dense

241
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,916
I can't see my hand
in front of my face.

242
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,083
[ASHIYA]
Are we lost?

243
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,250
I was using the hairball's
presence to navigate.

244
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,583
But I can't pick it up anymore.

245
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,833
Don't tell me we're
stuck in here now, too!

246
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,666
[ABENO]
There's no other choice.

247
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,125
[ABENO]
All right, Nobou.

248
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,541
Looks like I'm gonna have
to try to exorcise you here.

249
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,791
[NOBOU]
I don't know.

250
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,375
The whole thing is
making me really nervous!

251
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,125
Can you summon a portal?

252
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:58,208
I mean, the smell is even
more pungent right here.

253
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,083
And it would probably be
easier if we were somewhere

254
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,083
with less smoke,
don't you think?

255
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,458
What I really think...

256
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,875
[ASHIYA]
Huh?

257
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,708
[ABENO] ...is you should shut up
for at least 30 seconds.

258
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,916
Okay, sorry.

259
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,291
[ASHIYA]
Thirty seconds.

260
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,000
[coughs]

261
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,750
[ASHIYA]
He's gonna kill me for that!

262
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,750
[ASHIYA] Ah! I didn't
mean to do it, I swear!

263
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,625
Wait... a scarecrow?

264
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,041
[ASHIYA gasps]
Where am I?

265
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,791
[NOBOU] Did you see how hard
I was working, old chum?

266
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,916
I am in rare form today!

267
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
[ASHIYA]
Nobou!

268
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,791
Uh... Did I accidentally
let go of you?

269
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,041
Sorry 'bout that.

270
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,166
[NOBOU] You can tell
me you're impressed.

271
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,125
I can handle the compliment.

272
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,541
[ASHIYA]
Hold on...

273
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,708
[NOBOU]
Yes, I even surprised myself!

274
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,500
[ASHIYA]
Is this the phantasmagoria

275
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:56,958
he was talking about?

276
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,416
[NOBOU]
...can go a long way!

277
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,291
And you're such a good friend.

278
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:03,458
Hey, Nobou, can you
even hear me right now?

279
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,125
[NOBOU]
We make a great team, don't we?

280
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,541
Ready to protect the rice
from scavengers and invaders

281
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,666
without ever tiring
or complaining.

282
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,500
[NOBOU] What came next happened
in the blink of an eye.

283
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,000
I wanted to carry my
friend away from the flames

284
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,791
where he'd be safe.

285
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,875
But I was overwhelmed
by the heat

286
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,166
and utterly frozen by my fear.

287
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,791
Every time I
revisit this memory,

288
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,791
this waking nightmare...

289
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:32,041
It's like I'm right back in the
middle of the fire once again.

290
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,125
It's as if my old
friend is keeping me

291
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,041
from leaving this place.

292
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,333
I imagine it's because he
resents me for my inability

293
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,208
to save him that day.

294
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,958
[ASHIYA]
Nobou...

295
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,416
He's enormous now.

296
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,125
[NOBOU] I foolishly believed
that with your help,

297
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,208
I would finally be able
to escape this place.

298
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,750
That I would stop reliving
my horrible failure

299
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,791
over and over again.

300
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,333
But my friend
put a curse on me.

301
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,666
He couldn't forgive
my lack of action.

302
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,083
I just stood there
while he burned.

303
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,750
So he's bound me
here for all eternity.

304
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,708
[ASHIYA]
You're wrong!

305
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,750
You were trying to save him
the only way you could.

306
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,208
It's not your fault
he didn't make it!

307
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,541
[NOBOU]
That's kind of you.

308
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,041
But I failed him.

309
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:21,000
[ABENO] Well...
I think it was your fault.

310
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,333
Uh, wait. Do you mean that?

311
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,958
Definitely.

312
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,125
I apologize, Nobou.

313
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,041
But due to the state
that you're in right now,

314
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,291
I'm afraid...

315
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,083
...I can't exorcise you.

316
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,541
[NOBOU]
Oh. I see.

317
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,958
I suppose this is my fate.

318
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,791
[ASHIYA] Abeno, you saw what
happened that day, didn't you?

319
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,375
Yes, I did.

320
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,833
Then could you bother telling us
what exactly Nobou did wrong?

321
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,166
I mean, he was in the
worst situation possible!

322
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,583
What could he have
done differently?

323
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,166
[ASHIYA]
Ow!

324
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,208
Ashiya.

325
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,833
What if it had been you instead?

326
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,625
If you had been in
Nobou's place that day,

327
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,291
scared, unable to
help your friend...

328
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,500
Do you think you could claim
you weren't responsible?

329
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,791
Listen up, Nobou.

330
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,541
It's not your old friend
that's binding you here.

331
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,583
If you want my take on it,

332
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,875
you're doing this yourself.

333
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,125
[NOBOU]
I am? What do you mean?

334
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,583
Don't you think it's possible
that you subconsciously

335
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:25,500
created all this mud and
smoke to keep yourself here?

336
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,875
You made it so you
could never run away.

337
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,083
So you couldn't leave
anybody behind again.

338
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,375
[NOBOU]
Oh, dear.

339
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,416
This is embarrassing.

340
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,250
What's happening to me?

341
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,166
Am I really crying?

342
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,958
That's why I can't exorcise you.

343
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,791
Because you don't
really want to leave.

344
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,000
But you can't
stay here anymore.

345
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,500
So you have to make a decision.

346
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:54,833
Do you understand?

347
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:58,166
You have to discover
the resolve inside yourself.

348
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,750
[NOBOU] If I do that,
you think I can leave?

349
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,000
[ABENO] All right, man,
it's time we got back to Zenko

350
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,083
and the hairball.

351
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,916
[ASHIYA]
What about him?

352
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,083
He's gonna have to stay
here until he can leave

353
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,875
on his own.

354
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,583
Don't you understand that
he's not able to do that?

355
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,250
That's the reason why he needed
our help in the first place!

356
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,666
If you can't walk,
drag yourself.

357
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,416
[NOBOU]
Huh?

358
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,666
Just keep moving.

359
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,250
Through all of this smoke.

360
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,500
Don't give up.

361
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,291
It's the only way outta here.

362
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:27,916
[phone chimes]

363
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,125
It's a text from Zenko
asking if we're okay.

364
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,375
She's worried.

365
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,833
[ABENO]
Tell her we're on our way back.

366
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:36,916
[ASHIYA]
Yeah, okay.

367
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,833
[ABENO]
Nobou.

368
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,833
Take all the time you need.

369
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,208
We'll be waiting for you.

370
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,000
[NOBOU] But if the mud
and smoke overtake me again,

371
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:47,208
it could take quite a long time
to get to the edge of the field.

372
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,416
[ABENO, ASHIYA]
We'll wait.

373
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:51,958
[ABENO]
Don't worry.

374
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,750
I promise I won't abandon you.

375
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:55,916
Come on, Ashiya.

376
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,666
[NOBOU]
You're leaving.

377
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,333
Before you go,

378
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,875
you realize you could
be waiting forever.

379
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,125
That I may never make it out.

380
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:10,083
Yet... You're still
willing to wait for me?

381
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,208
We are!

382
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,875
We'll be seeing ya!

383
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,625
[coughs]

384
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:18,958
It's so stinky.

385
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,666
[NOBOU]
My friend...

386
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,083
I shackled myself here
with all this mud and smoke

387
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,416
because I foolishly believed
that by remaining in that day,

388
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,250
I could somehow atone
for what I did.

389
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,416
However...

390
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,541
The time has come for
me to leave, my friend.

391
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:47,666
And once I'm gone,
I can never return.

392
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,333
[NOBOU]
I can't give up.

393
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,833
I must keep moving forward.

394
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,583
They are waiting for me.

395
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,708
I don't want them
to wait forever.

396
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,166
These will be the last
words I speak to you,

397
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,708
old friend.

398
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,250
Therefore I must tell
you what's been weighing

399
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,041
on my conscience
for far too long.

400
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,666
[NOBOU gasps]

401
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:29,125
[NOBOU] My dear friend, if I
had been more strong of heart.

402
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,750
If I had endured the
flames a bit longer.

403
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,291
If I had pulled a bit harder.

404
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,083
So many things I could've
done differently.

405
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,958
Maybe I could've been
able to save you that day.

406
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:43,833
But I did what I did,
and I lost you.

407
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,375
[sobs]

408
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,458
I ran away.

409
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,291
And though I've regretted
my actions these many years,

410
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,291
that is what led me to them.

411
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,875
For the first time,
I'm happy that I chose to run.

412
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,750
Because I feel this way,

413
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:01,291
I don't think I can truly
claim that I am your friend.

414
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,416
How could I be glad
about leaving you behind?

415
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,583
[sobs]

416
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:06,833
But know this.

417
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,875
Before tragedy struck
our field and destroyed

418
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,166
all that we had known,

419
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,416
I spent the happiest
days of my life

420
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,958
working in the hot
sun alongside you.

421
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:18,041
There is no joy that
could ever compare to it.

422
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,958
You gave me a gift for which
I am eternally grateful.

423
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:26,250
Thank you for being there.
Thank you for listening.

424
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,833
Thank you for understanding!

425
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,000
[NOBOU]
Goodbye...

426
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,958
...my dear old friend.

427
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,666
Goodbye.

428
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,750
[ZENKO] Nobou still hasn't
made it out of the farm.

429
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Is Abeno asleep?

430
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,500
[ASHIYA] He doesn't want us
to talk to him so he can focus.

431
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,250
Focus? On what?

432
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,958
On summoning a portal
to the Underworld.

433
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,791
Smell's been getting in the way.

434
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,833
[ZENKO]
A portal to the Underworld?

435
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,958
Do you think you
should head home soon?

436
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,958
I bet your dad's worried sick.

437
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,375
No, it's okay.

438
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,291
He's gonna be super mad
at me, but I don't care.

439
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,875
I'll wait here with you.

440
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,416
[NOBOU]
Abeno! Ashiya!

441
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,250
Nobou!

442
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,000
[laughs] You made it!

443
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,083
[NOBOU grunts]

444
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,083
[NOBOU]
Oh, dear.

445
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,458
Well, that was a
little embarrassing.

446
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:04,166
I want you to know that
I owe my freedom to you.

447
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,500
I was finally able
to leave that place.

448
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,916
Because you said
that you'd wait for me.

449
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,041
[NOBOU crying]

450
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,666
You gave me the
courage to face my fears

451
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,333
and say goodbye
to my old friend!

452
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,250
[ASHIYA] It must have been
more painful for him

453
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,333
than any of us
could've imagined.

454
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,958
But his faith in
the promise we made...

455
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,000
...gave him the
strength to move on.

456
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,916
[ASHIYA] Thank you for
finding your resolve.

457
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,416
And thank you
for believing in yourself.

458
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,458
[NOBOU] No, thank you
for helping me find it

459
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,166
and for waiting for me.

460
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,833
Look at the farm.

461
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,125
[ABENO] Nobou, I'm glad
to see you've made it through.

462
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,916
[NOBOU]
Thank you, Abeno.

463
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,875
[crying]

464
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:59,083
If I may ask this
of you one last time...

465
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:02,583
...will you grant my wish
and send me to the Underworld?

466
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,333
[ABENO]
Of course I will.

467
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,375
[ZENKO] It really is a
portal to the Underworld.

468
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,833
[NOBOU]
My dear friend.

469
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,708
I will cherish the memories
of those wonderful days

470
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,041
we spent together.

471
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,625
I will take that happiness
and pain with me

472
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,458
to the Underworld.

473
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,416
You will be in my
thoughts for all eternity.

474
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:47,208
[NOBOU] Thank you
for bidding me farewell!

475
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,583
Thank you!

476
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:01,250
[NOBOU] Thank you,
my most treasured friend.

477
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:35,708
[ASHIYA] Zenko's dad definitely
has the wrong idea about me.

478
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:36,625
But Abeno...

479
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,333
With his blond hair, good looks,

480
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,416
and those eyes that bore
right through your soul,

481
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,875
he seems way more dangerous.

482
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:42,958
[ABENO]
Now, who's dangerous?

483
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,083
[ASHIYA gasps]
Hold on!

484
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,541
How long have you
been standing there?

485
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:46,666
[ABENO]
Long enough.
