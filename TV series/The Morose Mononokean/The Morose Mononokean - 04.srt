1
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:09,833
[ASHIYA]
This is nice and peaceful.

2
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:13,125
So different from
all the craziness

3
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,625
that's been happening
since I started school.

4
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:17,583
To think if I hadn't
stepped on the fuzz ball,

5
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:20,291
I would've just had a regular
life like everybody else.

6
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,541
[ASHIYA sighs]

7
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,791
What I wouldn't give to pet
that fluffy little ball of floof

8
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,791
just one more time.

9
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,625
The thing was pretty fluffy.

10
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,958
Yeah. Most of the
experience was horrible.

11
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,625
But every time I slept,
he'd curl up

12
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:37,041
in the perfect snuggly
place right next to my head.

13
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,458
He's not a pillow.

14
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,750
Well, if more <i>yokai</i>
were fuzz balls like him,

15
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,958
this job would be a heck of a
lot more enjoyable, you know?

16
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,541
Ya want fuzz balls?

17
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,458
The thought of all those
man-eating <i>yokai</i> out there

18
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:48,958
terrifies me.

19
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,750
But I'll take any fluff job
that comes my way!

20
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,666
Just all fluff all the time.

21
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,375
[ASHIYA] I know what
you're really thinking!

22
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:58,375
It's because I'm a five-year-old
who can't handle anything else!

23
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,791
I'm just useless dead weight,

24
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,625
and every job
I've been on so far,

25
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,708
you've had to come
and bail me out.

26
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,666
I might as well just go.

27
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,333
You're such a sad sack.

28
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,208
Stop whining and
give me your hand.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,041
[ASHIYA]
What's this?

30
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,666
[ABENO] It's your pay
for that last job.

31
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,208
I mean, you could've
done better,

32
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,791
but you did get the mask
back to the client.

33
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,666
But I still owe you like
a million en, don't I?

34
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,291
Then start saving 'em up.

35
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,750
Once we're square,
you can quit

36
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,958
and try living life
like everyone else.

37
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:29,416
Okay.

38
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,791
Hey, tell me something.

39
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,208
Do you think Fuzzy

40
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:36,583
will ever come back
to the mundane world?

41
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,708
This world?

42
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:41,041
I'd love to see him again.

43
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,083
All I can say is
stick to the job,

44
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,958
and that might
happen eventually.

45
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,375
[ASHIYA]
Seriously?

46
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,583
[ABENO] The real question is,
what'll happen first?

47
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,416
Seeing him, or paying me?

48
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,916
[ASHIYA]
Uh...

49
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,500
[ASHIYA]
You're going out?

50
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,541
I'll be gone all day
today and tomorrow.

51
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,083
Just FYI, because I don't want
you getting all annoying

52
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,291
and stuff again.

53
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,083
Mind telling me
where you'll be?

54
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,166
[bell ringing]

55
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,041
Kiyakudo?

56
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,916
Ya don't have to
tell him everything.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,416
Kiyakudo.

58
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,750
Why does that sound
strangely familiar to me?

59
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,833
Oh, I remember!

60
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,666
That's the apothecary you
were telling the big boss about!

61
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,250
Yup. It is.

62
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,625
But I also remember you saying
the shop was in the Underworld.

63
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,125
Oh, no way!

64
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,750
You can actually go
to the Underworld?

65
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,291
[bell ringing]

66
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,958
[ASHIYA]
"You can, too, Hanae."

67
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:02,833
You mean it?

68
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,250
--Slow down!
--[bell ringing]

69
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,041
[ASHIYA] "Wouldn't it be
good for Hanae to see

70
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,041
the Underworld once?"

71
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,916
A field trip sounds amazing!

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,916
What? You realize he's
scared to death of <i>yokai</i> !

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,500
Seems to me that's the last
place that we should send him!

74
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,041
Come on. I'm down.

75
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,291
Yeah?

76
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,333
[bell ringing]

77
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,791
[ABENO]
What?

78
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,250
I know you don't
really wanna go there.

79
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,000
You're just saying that
'cause ya think I'm trying

80
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,333
to test your nerve.

81
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,291
No. That's not it.

82
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,041
To be honest, I'm curious.

83
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,041
Besides, it makes sense.

84
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,083
Because if I'm gonna be
stuck working for you,

85
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:42,041
I should learn as much as I
can about the job and <i>yokai</i> .

86
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,916
I mean that's a
pretty good reason.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,375
Don't you agree?

88
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,375
[ABENO sighs]
Fine.

89
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,000
This Saturday.

90
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,750
We don't have school that day.

91
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,083
So meet me on the
roof at noon sharp.

92
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,125
That's awesome!

93
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,208
[bell ringing]

94
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,500
[ASHIYA]
Thanks!

95
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,333
"Don't let any <i>yokai</i>
eat your eyes or ears"?!

96
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,958
[STUDENT 4A] You guys wanna
go grab a bite on Saturday?

97
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,375
My treat!

98
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,333
--[STUDENT 4B] Aw yeah!
--[STUDENT 4C] I'm there, dude!

99
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,291
[ASHIYA]
It's been a few days.

100
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,833
And every time I've seen Abeno,
he falls asleep immediately.

101
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,625
And then he's gone
before I know it.

102
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,875
I haven't had the
chance to ask him

103
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,625
what the Underworld looks like.

104
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,250
I hope it's not like those
horrible paintings of hell!

105
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,541
--[camera shutter clicks]
--[gasps]

106
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,625
[FUSSHI]
Now there's a look!

107
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,333
[ASHIYA]
You scared me!

108
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,791
So what's with the camera?

109
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,625
I'm in the photography club.

110
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,875
And we're having a contest
coming up real soon.

111
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:38,875
Oh, yeah?

112
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,083
Check out this killer cat pic.

113
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,833
--Sure! I love cats!
--Could be a winner.

114
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,125
[ASHIYA]
Whoa!

115
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,291
Cool, huh?

116
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,958
Yeah, not very friendly.

117
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,916
You gotta go see the nurse!

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,041
Okay, right; where is
her office again, man?

119
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,708
It's straight down the hallway!

120
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,416
There's a bunch of gauze
and ointment and stuff

121
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,041
in the white cabinet
near the door.

122
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,458
[FUSSHI laughs]
Course you'd know.

123
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,416
You're "the kid from
the nurse's office."

124
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,541
That supposed to
be a nickname?

125
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,000
[FUSSHI] But I'm not gonna
sting myself with any medicine.

126
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,875
[ASHIYA]
You have to disinfect it!

127
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,833
[FUSSHI]
Sure thing!

128
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,041
[ASHIYA]
Medicine...

129
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,958
[ASHIYA] I'll bet the reason
Abeno needs to go

130
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,708
is to get more of the stuff
he gave to the Big Boss.

131
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,000
[ASHIYA] Maybe that's a
tool that exorcists need

132
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,875
to have on hand or something.

133
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,875
[ASHIYA]
Hey, I'm here!

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,666
That's not the same
kimono you usually wear.

135
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,750
It is when I visit
the Underworld.

136
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,208
And you'll be wearing this.

137
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,333
Oh, really?

138
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:42,875
No thanks.

139
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,333
[ABENO]
I only had a woman's cloak,

140
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,375
so you're just gonna
have to deal with it.

141
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,000
So long as you wear that thing,

142
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,375
everybody'll know
you work for me.

143
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,833
So if you don't want to be
possessed, you should put it on.

144
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,250
Think I'd rather be possessed.

145
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,500
Put it on!

146
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,958
The Mononokean
wanted you to have this.

147
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,791
[ASHIYA]
It wrote me a personal note?

148
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,375
--[ASHIYA] This a field trip?
--[ABENO] Business trip.

149
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,458
But, the Mononokean
was worried about you.

150
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,250
So if you just
follow the rules,

151
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,166
everything'll be hunky dory.

152
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,666
[ASHIYA]
Great.

153
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,041
Now the Mononokean is treating
me like a little kid, too.

154
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,833
[MITSUCHIGURA] Human beings
such as him are invaluable.

155
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:28,583
All the more reason
to proceed with caution.

156
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,041
I feel stupid.

157
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,916
And please don't tell me
that I look stupid

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,666
in this ridiculous outfit.

159
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,833
And don't you dare
tell me it suits me.

160
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,541
[ABENO]
You look fine.

161
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,083
Oh. Okay. Whatever.

162
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,166
I'm opening the door now.

163
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,916
Mononokean master Haruitsuki.

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,916
Requesting a portal
to the Underworld.

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,375
Grant me entrance.

166
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,583
Hold on...
Can I ask you something?

167
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,958
What?

168
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,458
[ASHIYA] If Mitsuchigura
could enter the Underworld

169
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,375
through the Mononokean's
little door, why can't we?

170
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,500
Only I can cross
worlds through it.

171
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,625
That's 'cause I'm the
master of the Mononokean.

172
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,833
You could argue it's
one of the perks.

173
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,250
But because he came
from the Underworld,

174
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,500
he couldn't come into ours.

175
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,041
That's why he had
to hire us, ya know?

176
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,291
[ASHIYA]
Of course.

177
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,333
[ABENO] And since you
come in from this world,

178
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,041
you can't pass through to there.

179
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,625
[ASHIYA]
Uh, so...

180
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,416
[ABENO] The door to the
Underworld connects it

181
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,750
to this world, making it
possible to pass between them.

182
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,666
That's the only way it works.

183
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,083
Ah. But...

184
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,791
As long as I go
through this way,

185
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,291
everything will be just fine.

186
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:46,208
Yeah, it'll be great for you.

187
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,916
You do realize this
means I'm gonna have to

188
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,541
open this thing twice, right?

189
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,875
We gotta get in, and then
we gotta get back out.

190
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:55,625
Uh... And that's why it's
not so great for you, huh?

191
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,375
I'll be fine, but try to
remember just one more rule.

192
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,583
What is it?

193
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,416
While we're down
in the Underworld,

194
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,750
don't let anyone know
that you're a human.

195
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,208
[ABENO]
All right.

196
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,000
Let's go.

197
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,083
[ASHIYA]
So, uh...

198
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,541
What happens if I let that slip?

199
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,708
Well, they won't give you
a quick and painless death,

200
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,041
that's for sure.

201
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,916
You mean if they find out,
they'll really kill me?

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,791
Ya thinkin' about
hangin' back now?

203
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,208
No! Hey! I wanna go!

204
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,291
[ABENO]
Sure.

205
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,125
[ASHIYA]
I'm scared out of my mind.

206
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,541
But hopefully I'll
see Fuzzy again.

207
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,916
That'll make it better.

208
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,750
[ASHIYA] This creepy place
is the Underworld,

209
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,791
where <i>yokai</i> dwell.

210
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:58,125
I hope Fuzzy didn't
get lost in this place.

211
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,916
What if Big Boss Scree
ran out of steam

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,500
on the way down here?

213
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm starting to feel
super anxious and weird.

214
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,166
Really weak.

215
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,583
And kinda like I could puke.

216
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,583
Is this Underworld sickness?

217
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,041
[ASHIYA]
Well, at least I can still walk.

218
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,333
[ABENO]
Hey.

219
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,291
We're almost to the exit.

220
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,875
Oh. Okay.

221
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:25,875
[ABENO]
Are you sick?

222
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,250
No, man, I feel fine.

223
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,041
[coughs]

224
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,875
You're obviously not fine.

225
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,666
The rules said to
tell me immediately

226
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,333
if you start to feel sick.

227
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm just peachy.

228
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,416
You look like crap!

229
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,083
Underworld sickness can
make you emotionally unstable.

230
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,083
That's why we have
the damn rules!

231
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,375
[ASHIYA growls]

232
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,958
Clean out your ears,
because I said I was fine!

233
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,250
Rule number three
says no quarrelling with you,

234
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,833
so sorry about all that.

235
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,708
Let's head to the exit.

236
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,250
If he thinks he's
fooling me with that,

237
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,833
he's lost his mind.

238
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,833
Whoa. It's so bright.

239
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,083
This... is the Underworld?

240
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,416
[ABENO] Quit staring
and get a move on.

241
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,583
[ASHIYA]
Yeah, okay.

242
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,541
[ASHIYA]
I thought it'd be scary.

243
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,375
But besides the
<i>yokai</i> everywhere,

244
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,541
it's not so different
from our world.

245
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,041
So bright and colorful.

246
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,833
[ASHIYA] Wow, it's nothing
like that tunnel, huh?

247
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,333
And I feel better.

248
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,958
Like, really good.
That was a close one.

249
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,375
I knew you were sick!

250
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,500
Sorry.

251
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,375
[ABENO]
We're here.

252
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,916
This is Kiyakudo.

253
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,875
[KOURA, SHIZUKU]
Welcome to our shop!

254
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,833
Oh. Itsuki!

255
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,458
Good to see you again.

256
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,875
Yeah, likewise.

257
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,333
Looks like you've got a
lot going on here today.

258
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,083
[ASHIYA]
Humans?

259
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,166
Shizuku's gotten better
as passing for a human.

260
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,750
Haven't you, love?

261
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,125
[SHIZUKU laughs]
Yeah!

262
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,791
Keep that praise comin'!

263
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,708
You've still got your
newt's tail, though, huh?

264
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,291
That's her tail?

265
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,791
I don't know why it's so hard to
make this stupid thing go away!

266
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,500
But the tail is a little
reminder of who you truly are,

267
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,958
so I'm rather fond of it.

268
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:29,166
Well, then, I guess I really
don't mind it so much after all.

269
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,166
I see you're still
in love with your master.

270
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,500
Anyway... I'm here
to get the usual.

271
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:39,250
I thought you might need to
replenish soon, but first...

272
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,583
Let me.

273
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,125
But first what?

274
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,333
It's been forever
since I've touched you.

275
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,166
Your aroma is still
so intoxicating.

276
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,291
And these lovely fingers.

277
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,375
Your whole body...

278
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,666
[ASHIYA]
This is getting kinda naughty.

279
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,875
[KOURA]
Those beautiful eyes.

280
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,500
I could make the highest
quality medicine with them.

281
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,250
Quit being so freaky!

282
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,416
Ah! First, I'd need
to dry the eyeballs,

283
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,750
slice them up nice and thin,

284
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,791
and keep them at a rolling
boil for an hour or so.

285
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,916
Ah! The thought
of making medicine

286
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,416
from your exquisite body...

287
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,625
It's almost too much
for me to handle.

288
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,666
[ASHIYA] This has gone
way beyond naughty!

289
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,666
She could make a
much better medicine

290
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,375
from my body if she wanted to.

291
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,416
In fact, I hope his
eyeballs crumble up

292
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,875
and fall out of the sockets.

293
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,500
[ASHIYA]
Whoa, is she jealous?

294
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,958
Tell me, Itsuki.

295
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,666
Who is this boy with you?

296
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,166
[ASHIYA]
You mean me? I'm Ashiya.

297
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,541
He's the newest employee
of the Mononokean.

298
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,000
Your new assistant?

299
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,625
Hi...!

300
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,166
I sincerely hope that we
didn't come across as rude

301
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,333
by not introducing
ourselves sooner.

302
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,416
My name's Koura,

303
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,041
and I am the mistress
of the Kiyakudo.

304
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,166
I'm Shizuku,
her faithful employee.

305
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,500
It's a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

306
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,833
Same here.

307
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,208
It's very nice to meet you both.

308
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,750
Guess they're kinda normal.

309
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,708
Ashiya, you have exquisite ears.

310
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,416
Would you consider selling
them to me as a set?

311
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,791
[ASHIYA] Nevermind,
they may be the scariest <i>yokai</i>

312
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,125
I've met so far!

313
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,916
[KOURA] I'd take whatever
you'd part with,

314
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,625
be it tooth, tongue, finger...

315
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,750
My ears are much
more exquisite than his!

316
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,958
Koura, quit messing around
and make with the pills, okay?

317
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,083
Yes, of course.

318
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,166
I should've mentioned
this sooner.

319
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,250
But sadly I don't have
any at the moment.

320
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,458
Really? But you know
I need them.

321
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,208
I was careless
and gave it all

322
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,166
to another customer
a few days ago.

323
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,625
What? How could you?

324
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,041
[SHIZUKU]
Don't get mad at her, okay?

325
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,958
It's your fault
that we're out of them!

326
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,166
Because you went and
told some random <i>yokai</i>

327
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,458
that you exorcised about
our shop, didn't you?

328
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,833
Some spiky ball-looking guy
that screeched all the time?

329
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,500
Must've been the Big Boss.

330
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,083
I know who you're
talkin' about now.

331
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,250
How awesome!

332
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,708
That means he made it here!

333
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,750
[KOURA] Anyway, this
so-called "Big Boss"

334
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,166
came here to the shop.

335
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,750
He told us he was
one of your friends,

336
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,958
so I gave him the
medicine he asked for.

337
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,250
Naturally...

338
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,000
I ran the order and
put everything

339
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,708
on the Mononokean's tab.

340
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,875
I thought that might happen,
so it's fine with me.

341
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,666
Then I hope it's also
fine that we gave him

342
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,458
your portion of the medicine.

343
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,833
We were worried that
it might make you angry.

344
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,875
But the poor old guy
was in such bad shape

345
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,083
that we really had
no other choice.

346
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,083
I'm not mad at
you ladies at all.

347
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,250
And I do appreciate
the consideration

348
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,416
you showed my client.

349
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,458
But still...

350
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,500
I do need what
I came here to get.

351
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,000
And I need it
as soon as possible.

352
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,708
Of course I'll pay extra
for the rush charge.

353
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:27,875
Please.

354
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,583
[ASHIYA]
He really needs it.

355
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,041
You do know I would
gladly forgo the rush fee

356
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,875
if you'd just hand over
those beautiful eyes to me.

357
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,416
We can't give it
to you just yet,

358
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,416
but it'll be ready
before too long.

359
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,416
I'll go super fast!

360
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,583
You are?

361
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,708
We were just whipping
up a little batch

362
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,166
before you two showed up.

363
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,625
I hope you don't mind
waiting a bit longer.

364
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,833
[ABENO]
It's cool.

365
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,083
Oh! By the way.

366
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,291
Will you please do
me a small favor?

367
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,000
What is it?

368
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,291
I have a request
for the both of you.

369
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,666
Your hands. I need them.

370
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,541
[ASHIYA gasps]
That is definitely not worth it!

371
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,458
[ASHIYA] I got a little
freaked out by that.

372
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,208
She was trying to say that
she needed some help

373
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,791
around the store.

374
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,500
I thought she meant that she was
just gonna chop 'em right off.

375
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,166
Koura knew exactly
what she was saying, man.

376
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,125
She was trying to freak you out.

377
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,583
Well, at least this
will kill some time

378
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,875
while we're waiting around,

379
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,708
and I actually don't mind
helping them out.

380
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,416
[ASHIYA] But their ingredients
are so gross!

381
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,916
Well this doesn't make sense.

382
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,625
Is there something wrong?

383
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:29,791
Kinda.

384
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,666
The inventory list
for this one is missing.

385
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,625
I'm gonna go check
with Shizuku about this.

386
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:34,666
You think you're good in here?

387
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,208
Yeah.

388
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,208
[ABENO]
Ugh.

389
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,333
I hate going into
their workshop.

390
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,916
The screams give me
the heebie-jeebies.

391
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,750
[ASHIYA] If it bothers him,
it must be pretty bad.

392
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,958
I almost can't believe
the kind of crazy stuff

393
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:54,458
they have sitting
around in jars. Huh.

394
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,375
Now which one
has the worms?

395
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,458
Let me see.

396
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,541
A-ha!

397
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,791
Wait a sec...

398
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,083
Is that him?

399
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,458
Fuzzy!

400
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,458
I bet I could catch up
with him if I ran.

401
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,958
But I'm sure that
if I leave the shop,

402
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,833
I'm definitely gonna
get chewed out.

403
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:15,958
Uh-oh.

404
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,791
Blood? Is he hurt?

405
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,375
[ASHIYA] I know I'm
breaking the rules here.

406
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,458
Abeno's gonna be furious.

407
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,791
If there's this much blood,
he must be pretty messed up.

408
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,916
Fuzzy, hold on, please!
Wait up!

409
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:36,875
[ASHIYA]
Gotcha!

410
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,708
Fuzzy! It's me!
Are you okay?

411
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,875
What happened?
You're bleeding like crazy!

412
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,875
The heck?

413
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,666
It's juice? Not blood....

414
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,208
Excuse me. Are you Fuzzy?

415
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,875
[ASHIYA] It's like his
twin or something.

416
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,416
Fuzzy doppelganger?

417
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,125
Uh, hey, fuzz ball!

418
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,833
Do you still want this thing?

419
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,208
I guess he's too
far away to hear me.

420
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,625
Now what am I supposed do?

421
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,458
[CAPY]
Stop!

422
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,041
Get back here!

423
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,583
[CAPY]
Thief!

424
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,583
That was a little weird.

425
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,666
Oh, well.

426
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,791
This has taken up
way too much time.

427
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,250
I better try and get
back to the shop

428
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,791
before he notices I'm gone.

429
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,041
[gasps]

430
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,083
[CAPY]
Caught ya red-handed, ya thief!

431
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,333
A capybara?

432
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,500
And just who are you
calling a thief, anyway?

433
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,958
[CAPY] You thought
you could transform

434
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,666
and get away from me,
but I got news for you.

435
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,375
It ain't happening today.

436
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,875
Wait, why do you think
I stole something from you?

437
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,333
[CAPY] Because you're
holding it, you damn idiot!

438
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,875
What?

439
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,583
[CAPY] You stole that fruit from
my stand, just a minute ago.

440
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:49,750
Oh, this thing?

441
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,583
No!

442
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,708
There was a <i>yokai</i> running
with it and he dropped it.

443
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,583
I just picked it
up off the ground.

444
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,041
[CAPY] I guess I'm just
gonna have to teach you

445
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,000
not to steal from me.

446
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:12,083
And it's gonna
be a painful lesson.

447
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,625
Hold on...

448
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,666
Is that the Mononokean's crest?

449

Uh... Yes, sir, it is.

450
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,250
[MALE YOKAI 4A]
Mononokean?

451
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,000
Wait, you mean the exorcist?

452
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,083
I've never seen one.

453
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:27,125
[ASHIYA]
Is the Mononokean famous here?

454
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,083
[CAPY] How is a guy
like you connected to it?

455
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,083
Well, uh...

456
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,333
I'm a part-time employee.

457
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,875
[CAPY]
A part-timer, eh?

458
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,875
Well, that changes everything.

459
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,625
I reckon a more amicable
solution might suit both of us,

460
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,583
don't you think?

461
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,666
What exactly do
you mean by that?

462
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,916
[CAPY] What I mean is, since
you work for the Mononokean,

463
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,875
you must get paid pretty well.

464
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,416
So give me all your money,
Mr. Knife here goes away,

465
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
and I'll forget this whole
thing ever happened.

466
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,625
What do ya say?

467
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,750
Seems more than fair to me.

468
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,291
All my money?

469
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,916
And I can live?

470
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,666
This is everything I have.

471
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,458
I think it's a
pretty good deal too.

472

--[CAPY] Are you kidding me?
--[ASHIYA] I don't have more!

worth your pitiful spare change!

No, please don't kill me!

475

[MALE YOKAI 4A]
I heard a rumor

476
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,375
that the master of the
Mononokean has been working

477
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,833
all by himself recently.

478
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:23,541
Oh, so you're saying that
there are no employees?

479
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:24,916
[CAPY]
I get it.

480
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,541
You lied about working there
so you could get away!

481
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,875
Nice try, scumbag.

482
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,291
But come to think of it, someone
working for the Mononokean

483
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,500
wouldn't have to steal things!

484
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,500
[ASHIYA] I told you,
I didn't steal anything!

485
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,875
And I really do work
for the Mononokean!

486
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,541
I'm not lying!

487
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,416
[CAPY] You're making it
worse by lying to me, kid.

488
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,291
And that means this punishment
just got way harsher.

489
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:50,916
You'll learn your lesson all
right, and never forget it!

490
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,125
What's wrong with you?

491
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,958
This is just a misunderstanding!

492
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,083
Listen!

493
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,708
[CAPY]
If I cut off that arm,

494
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,125
you'll never steal
with it again!

495
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,708
[ASHIYA]
He actually tried to cut me!

496
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,041
[CAPY]
Don't run!

497
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,166
Hold still, so all I
cut off is your arm!

498
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,125
[ASHIYA yelling]

499
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,750
[CAPY] I don't wanna do this,
but I've got no choice!

500
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,750
If I let you go, it'll
send the wrong message

501
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,750
to the other thieves!

502
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:19,916
Listen up!

503
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,416
Pay attention so you
can see what happens

504
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,000
when ya steal from me!

505
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,250
Ya get cut!

506
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,583
[ASHIYA]
I'm dead!

507
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,958
[YOKAI yell]

508
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,666
[CAPY]
What the hell are you doing?

509
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,166
[CAPY]
Get off me, you little bastard!

510
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,125
[ASHIYA]
Is that the doppelganger?

511
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,083
No, it can't be!

512
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,916
[CAPY]
Let go, damn it!

513
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,375
Wait.

514
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,458
Whoa! Are you the real Fuzzy?

515
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:36,166
[ASHIYA] Oh my gosh, Fuzzy,
I've missed you so much!

516
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,458
[ABENO] Nobody said you could
go walkin' off on your own.

517
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:39,750
[ASHIYA]
Fuzzy!

518
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,166
[ABENO]
Are you even listening to me?

519
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,625
[ASHIYA]
Fuzzy! I'm so happy!

520
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,083
[ABENO]
Nope, not at all.
