00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,000
It's gotten to the Enzymes
that are being optimized

2
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,333
and now it's...

3
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:13,333
[chokes]
[GUYOT] Guyver III?

4
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,291
Then the one that appeared in
block number 7 must be...

5
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,416
[Zerbebuth cries out in pain]

6
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,041
[TETSURO] Guyver?

7
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:28,166
[TETSURO] Sho? Sho!

8
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:42,375
Sh..Sho, it's really
you, isn't it?

9
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:47,958
[TETSURO] But... that isn't
possible! I mean, you were...

10
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,708
[SHO] Tetsuro?

11
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,333
[SHO] Tetsuro?!

12
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,583
Huh?!

13
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:11,458
What's going on here?

14
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,750
I mean, where are we?

15
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,875
[TETSURO] <i>This doesn't</i>
<i>make any sense!</i>

16
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:20,291
Last I remember,
I was fighting Enzyme.

17
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,708
But, it's like my mind went
totally blank after that.

18
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,666
It's really you?
I can't believe this.

19
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,250
You really are Sho, aren't you?

20
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,625
Yeah, at least, last time
I checked I was.

21
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:46,166
I'm so glad you're alive!
Oh! I'm so glad!

22
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,916
I don't care how,
I'm just thankful!

23
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,833
Te..Tetsuro, wait.
What's going on here?

24
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,875
[SHO] I don't understand.

25
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,083
[SOLDIER] It's the Guyver!
Watch out!

26
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,625
[RISKER] It's me, you fools.
Calm down.

27
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,583
[SOLDIER] Inspector Risker...

28
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,458
Excuse me, Sir! We are under
orders from Commander Guyot

29
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,833
to bring the injured Zerbebuth
to the optimization room.

30
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:24,083
[RISKER] You're too late.

31
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,125
[SOLDIER] You mean...
[RISKER] His wounds were fatal.

32
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,708
I put him out of his misery.

33
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,166
It was the last favor I
could do as his friend.

34
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,166
[SOLDIER] Yes, Sir!

35
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:38,041
[RISKER] <i>I'm sure the commander</i>
<i>knows what really happened...</i>

36
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,833
<i>But at this point,</i>
<i>it doesn't matter.</i>

37
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:43,250

<i>unstoppable.</i>

38

<i>that we are virtually immortal.</i>

39
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,666
<i>Right now, my powers surpass</i>
<i>those of hyper-Zoanoids.</i>

40
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,875
<i>No one can defeat me, not</i>
<i>even Commander Guyot himself.</i>

41
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,625
[laughs]

42
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,166
[SHO] I MELTED? Are you serious?

43
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,541
[TETSURO] Uhm, well yeah...

44
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,250
That's what it looked
like at least.

45
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,708
What was it like?
Was it really bad?

46
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,708
[TETSURO] You don't
remember at all?

47
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,083
Well no...
[TETSURO] What about that?

48
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,791
[SHO] Did I do that?

49
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,041
[TETSURO] If you didn't,
I don't know who did.

50
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:24,875
When I came to, I was
standing over there.

51
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,458
I don't know what the
heck's going on anymore.

52
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,333
Did that Zoanoid kill me?

53
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,791
[TETSURO] Let's just
forget about that

54
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,250
and break outta here, okay?

55
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,833
Break out?
[TETSURO] You really are

56
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,375
clueless, aren't you?

57
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,708
This is Chronos Japanese
headquarters.

58
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:38,625
[Sho gasps in shock]

59
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,208
Yeah, they kinda captured me.

60
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,875
No way! Why didn't you
tell me that sooner?!

61
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:44,916
[SOLDIER] Up there!

62
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,750
[TETSURO]
Crap! There they are!

63
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,166
[SHO] Guyver!

64
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,958
[SOLDIER] This is block 9.

65
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,083
Guyver I is escaping with
a prisoner from solitary.

66
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,916
Currently in pursuit, Sir!

67
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,833
[SOLDIER 2] Commander Guyot!

68
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,041
I regret to inform you that
Zerbebuth has...

69
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,916
Yes, I know.
[SOLDIER 2] Sir?

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,750
Be gone.
[SOLDIER] Sir!

71
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,375
[GUYOT] <i>Risker, you bastard...</i>

72
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,000
[SOLDIER 3] This is the
optimizations section.

73
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,333
We've lost sight of Guyver III,

74
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,541
but are currently sending
out a search party.

75
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,541
[GUYOT] Find him!

76
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:24,083
<i>Guyver III... I can't</i>
<i>anticipate his moves.</i>

77
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,250
<i>What's his objective?</i>

78
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,375
Excuse me.
I apologize for being late.

79
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,583
I was told that Guyvers I
and III are in the building?

80
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,541
The Japanese Branch
is a disgrace.

81
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,666
Even if it is the Guyvers
we're dealing with,

82
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,541
I should think that with
all of our resources,

83
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,750
we could avoid such
an absolute disaster.

84
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,458
I always tried to tell Father

85
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,583
something like
this might happen.

86
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,500
Our defenses are rather lacking.

87
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,000
[GUYOT] They're
intolerably lacking.

88
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,000
[TETSURO] Hey!

89
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,875
[SHO] What?!

90
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,375
[SHO] Which way do we go?
Up or down?

91
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,583
Uh, well I was kind of shaken
up when I came here.

92
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,750
I remember being dragged
onto an elevator,

93
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,166
but I don't remember if
it went up or down.

94
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,625
[SHO] You've gotta be kidding!
[SOLDIER 4] I heard voices!

95
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,791
They must be close by!
Search the area thoroughly!

96
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,208
[SHO] Tetsuro!
[TSTSURO] All right, up!

97
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,250
[SHO] Sounds good to me!
Let's go!

98
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,000
[TETSURO] <i>Sho, it really</i>
<i>is you, isn't it?</i>

99
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,708
<i>I don't know what happened, but</i>
<i>somehow, you're still alive.</i>

100
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,708
<i>I'm glad, but...</i>

101
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:56,416
[SHO] Are you all right?
[TETSURO] Uh, yeah...

102
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,791
[SHO] Is something wrong?

103
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:03,458
Oh, uh no, it's nothing.

104
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,125
C'mon, we should hurry.
Let's go.

105
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,541
[SHO] Tetsuro?

106
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,500
What's wrong?
We gotta get moving.

107
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:18,125
[SHO] Please, tell me the truth.
I died back there, didn't I?

108
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,916
I shouldn't be alive.

109
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,541
You said I melted, right?

110
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,000
But does that mean I... I...

111
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:31,000
I see...

112
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:35,458
But then how did I come back?

113
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:39,000
Somehow... I guess the power of
the Guyver resurrected you.

114
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,291
It was... like a miracle!

115
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,625
[SHO] That's pretty unscientific
coming from you, Tetsuro.

116
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,041
There's got to be more to it.

117
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:52,666
Hey... What if you're a clone?
[SHO] A clone?

118
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,708
Yeah, sure!
I bet some of your cells

119
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,333
were left over on
the control metal

120
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:59,500
and the Guyver used its power to
reconstruct you from that.

121
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:00,916
That makes sense, right?

122
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,833
I mean, the Guyver can
regenerate pretty fast

123
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,250
so it makes sense if it did
the same thing to you.

124
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,833
[SHO] A clone...

125
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:10,875
[TETSURO] Uh, well, it's...
just a guess, really.

126
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,125
[SHO] But if you're right...

127
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,916
Does that mean I'm the
same as I was before?

128
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,333
[TETSURO] Well, uh...

129
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,333
[SHO] I don't know a
lot about this stuff,

130
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,541
but aren't clones just...

131
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,791
[SOLDIER 4] There they are!
Right up there!

132
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,291
Sho, as far as I'm concerned,
you're still you.

133
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,916
And that's enough for me.

134
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,458
[SHO] Tetsuro...
[TETSURO] Right now,

135
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,666
let's just get the
hell out of here!

136
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,250
We can't keep Mizuki
and your old man

137
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,750
waiting any longer, right?

138
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,416
[SHO] Right.

139
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,000
[SHO] <i>I bet Dad's worried sick</i>
<i>about me right now.</i>

140
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,541

<i>without telling me.</i>

141

00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,958
<i>Well, I guess he's</i>
<i>at that age now,</i>

<i>I can't help but think</i>
<i>that something bad</i>

146

<i>It's just like my father</i>
<i>used to say.</i>

147
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,250
<i>The more parents are</i>
<i>separated from their kids,</i>

148
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,041
<i>the more they worry.</i>

149
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,666
<i>I'm sure his mother would have</i>
<i>felt the same way right now.</i>

[claxons]
What's going on?

153
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,291
[SOLDIER] No way!

154
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,375
The self-destruct
system's online, Sir!

155
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,291
[GUYOT] What?!

156
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,875
[COMPUTER]
<i>The self-destruct sequence</i>

157
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,500
<i>has now been initiated.</i>

158
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:18,666
<i>T-minus 10 minutes.</i>
<i>Please evacuate immediately.</i>

159
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,125
[GUYOT] What is the
meaning of this?

160
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,458
[SOLDIER] I'm not sure, Sir.

161
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,791
It's the Emergency Biohazard
Response system.

162
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,458
It shouldn't have been so
easy to activate.

163
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,833
[MAKISHIMA]
It would be difficult

164
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,375
for an outsider to
pull this off.

165
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,625
[GUYOT] Are you saying we
were betrayed?

166
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:36,208
Well... I'm simply saying that
it wouldn't be possible

167
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,125
to initiate the
self-destruct system

168
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:41,583
without having considerable
knowledge of the building.

169
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,125
[GUYOT] Well, I can
think of a certain

170
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,625
overly ambitious employee

171
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,333
who acquired too much power
and let it go to his head.

172
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,708
<i>Would he go that far?</i>

173
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,791
[RISKER] <i>Self-destruct?</i>

174
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,875
What was the Commander thinking?
He's out of his mind.

175
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,875
[TETSURO] Don't tell me they're
going to blow up the building

176
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,291
and take everyone down with it!

177
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,041
[SHO] Isn't that a
little drastic?

178
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,916
Well, whatever! Let's hurry!
[SHO] Right!

179
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,875
[SOLDIER] It's no use,
Commander! We can't cancel

180
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,666
the sequence! Orders, Sir?!
[GUYOT] Calm down!

181
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,000
It can be canceled
within the first five

182
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,208
minutes of the countdown.
[SOLDIER] But, Sir!

183
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,416
Let me handle it.

184
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,250
[conintuing claxons]

185
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,875
[MAKISHIMA] Hm? No good.
[SOLDIER] It isn't working?!

186
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,083
The cancellation program's
been deleted.

187
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,000
So, now what?

188
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,583
There's a backup. I might
be able to restore it.

189
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,416
[SOLDIER] There's no time!

190
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
[GUYOT] Enough.
[MAKISHIMA] But, Sir,

191
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,291
at this rate, we'll lose the
entire Japanese Branch.

192
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,250
This place is useless to us.
If it's destroyed,

193
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,291
just make sure our secrets
are buried with it.

194
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,583
You evacuate as well.

195
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,416
Understood, Sir.
As an extra precaution,

196
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,083
I'll do a level five erase
on all network data.

197
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,666
The rest of you accompany the
Commander to the heliport.

198
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,541
See that the others are
evacuating as well.

199
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,958
[SOLDIERS] Sir!

200
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,541
[MAKISHIMA] I'll have Inspector
Risker escort you, Sir.

201
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,583
[GUYOT] Forget about him.
You take care of the rest.

202
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,666
Leave it to me, Sir.

203

[TETSURO] Huh? Whoa! Hold on!

213
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,208
[MAKISHIMA] Was that Guyver I?
Interesting.

214
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:55,083
Well, good luck surviving
this one. [claxons continue]

215
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,625
Good. That should take care
of things here.

216
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:04,208
[RISKER] I see. So you're the
one responsible for this mess.

217
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,916
Wait, we're on the roof?

218
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,500
[TETSURO] It's you!
[SHO] You know him?

219
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,333
Yeah, he's the commander
of Chronos.

220
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,458
[SHO] What?

221
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,791
[MAKISHIMA] If you're trying to
stop the self-destruct sequence,

222
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,291
give up.

223
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,333
Actually, at this point
I don't really care

224
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,083
what happens to the
Japanese Branch.

225
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,208
If there's anything I am
interested in it's you.

226
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,208
It's not every day
that I find someone

227
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,666
with a power that rivals mine.

228
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,458
[MAKISHIMA] I see. So you're
the "overly ambitious employee

229
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,958
who acquired too much power
and let it go to his head."

230
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,833
[RISKER] What?
[MAKISHIMA] Nevermind.

231
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,583
[RISKER] Wait! I want
you to fight me.

232
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:53,916
[MAKISHIMA] Why?

233
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,708
[RISKER] There is no need
for three Guyvers.

234
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,833
One will do. Adapt!

235
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,041
[MAKISHIMA] Well, that's fine
with me, really. [chuckles]

236
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,416
[RISKER] What's so funny?

237
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,250
[MAKISHIMA] Your work hasn't
been too taxing, has it?

238
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,875

00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,083
[SOLDIER] Commander, we're
running out of time!

242
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,791
[TETSURO] Wait!
[SHO] Tetsuro?

243
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,125
There's something I still
need to ask you.

244
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,416
You told me that humans
were created as the basis

245
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,416
for some kind of
living weapon right?

246
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,708
If that's the case, then who
was it that created us?!

247
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,375
Answer me, damn it!

248
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,125
[RISKER] Eat this!

249
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,166
[RISKER] Now I get it. This
newfound power of yours

250
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,125
has expanded your ambitions
as well as your ego.

251
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,250
[MAKISHIMA] Ambitions?

252
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,583
[RISKER] With the
power of the Guyver,

253
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,125
it should be easy for you

254
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,625
to achieve an elite
status at Chronos.

255
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,333
[MAKISHIMA] Is that what
you're fighting for?

256
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:08,708
I'm afraid I don't harbor
such grand ambitions.

257
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,750
[RISKER] What?
[MAKISHIMA] I seek the

258
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,333
Japanese Branch's
destruction, that's all.

259
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,000
For now, at least.

00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,208
No. I can't leave until
I know the truth.

265

[SHO] Tetsuro!

Commander!

267
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:46,458
The Creators. That is the name
we've given them.

268
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,333
Billions of years ago, a highly
intelligent race of beings

269
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,541
descended to Earth from the
far reaches of space.

270
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,625
Their appearance,
culture and home planet

271
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,333
are all a mystery to us.

272
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,750
They left very little behind.
All we know is that

273
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,833
they manipulated life on
Earth for billions of years

274
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:05,208
in an attempt to manufacture a
very specific type of lifeform,

275
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,416
a tool to serve their needs.

276
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,000
They required a creature
with great intelligence.

277
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,833
Something with highly
aggressive instincts

278
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:15,375
 and the adaptability to thrive
in any kind of environment.

279
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,208
They needed a lifeform that
would serve them

280
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,541
as a living weapon.

281
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,333
Something with unparalleled
fighting abilities.

282
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,833
[SHO] You mean?

283
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,333
After much trial and error,
what they ultimately created

284
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,916
was the human race.

285
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,833
Of course, that was only
the beginning.

286
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,791
Humans are simply the basis for
other bioweapons,

287
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,916
including the Zoanoids.

288
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,166
However, the experiment was
left only half-finished.

289
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,625
For reasons unknown
to us, one day,

290
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,708
the Creators suddenly
departed from the planet,

291
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,000
 never to be seen again.

292
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,250
And now... we will finish that
experiment using the knowledge

293
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,291
uncovered from the ruins the
Creators left behind.

294
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,833
We of Chronos will
enable humanity to

295
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:55,041
complete its transformation!
Its evolution!

296
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,666
Humanity shall perfect
its own form!

297
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,041
[MAKISHIMA] And after that, you
intend to take over the world!

298
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:04,333
Just so that elites like you
can rule as gods.

the hell are you?!

301
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,625
[MAKISHIMA] Why don't you
just call me Zeus?

302
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,333
[GUYOT] What do you
mean, "Zeus"?!

303
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,291
[MAKISHIMA] This is the end.

304
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,500
Chronos Japan will be destroyed

305
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,125

Commander, there's no more time!

308
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,041
[MAKISHIMA] Get down.

The metallic orb in your abdomen

311
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,458
is a gravity control device.

312
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:58,208
If you concentrate, you should
be able to levitate.

313
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,208
What do we do?
[SHO] There's not much choice.

314
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,208
[RISKER] Don't you dare
turn your back on me,

315
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,250
you son of a bitch!

316
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,583
[SHO] Guyver II!
[RISKER] Oh, look who it is.

317
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:15,875
You just don't know when
to stay dead, do you?

318
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,541
[RISKER] Well, don't worry,
I'll take care of that.

319
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:22,125
 I'm afraid there's only room
for one Guyver, and that's me.

320
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,541
[SHO] Wait! This place is gonna
self-destruct any minute now!

321
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,541
[RISKER] So what? After all,
there's nothing to fear

322
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,833
when you're immortal!

323
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,875
[RISKER] Let's see if you've
gotten any better

324
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,083
since last time.

325
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,000
Is this supposed to be
some kind of joke?

326
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,083
You're as sloppy as ever, kid!

327
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,541
[Sho grunts in pain]

328
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,958
Sho!
[RISKER] If you stop moving,

329
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,958
you'll leave yourself
open to attack.

330
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,833
[RISKER] Too slow!

00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,708
but I think it's about
time to end this!

334

You won't be coming back again,
Guyver I!

[NARRATOR]
For a fleeting moment,

355
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:33,416
it seemed as if life had
returned to normal for Sho.

356
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,916
Revisiting memories of his
childhood, he is unaware that

357
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,166
Guyot is still alive
and plotting his demise.

358
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,625
As the hyper-Zoanoid Panadyne
engulfs Sho's town in flames,

359
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:48,500
his precious memories and hopes
for peace are reduced to ash.

360
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,708
However, in the
midst of the flames,

361
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:54,541
a mysterious new ally appears
to stand beside the Guyver.

362
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:58,000
Next time:
"Ash and Memories"
