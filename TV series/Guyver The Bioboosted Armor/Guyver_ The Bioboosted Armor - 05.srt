1
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:06,208
[GENZO] No! Stop this!
This is insane! You can do this!

2
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:10,750
Please! I'll do anything!
I'm begging...

3
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,541
[GUYOT] You should be
grateful, Makishima.

4
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,541
I'm giving you a chance to
serve me one last time.

5
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:26,833
As an experimental
anti-Guyver Zoanoid.

6
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:44,041
[RISKER] "Anti-Guyver?" What
a needlessly extravagant title

7
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,291
for a Zoanoid.
Whatever it is,

8
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,291
I'm sure it's no match
for the Guyver.

9
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:53,541
The downfall of Genzo Makishima
coupled with Zerbebuth's defeat

10
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,708
will no doubt make
them reconsider

11
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,000
the value of my Guyver II.

12
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,500
Because in the end,

13
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:03,333
the only worthy match for
the Guyver is another Guyver.

14
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,708
[NEWS REPORTER]
<i>Police and fire teams</i>

15
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,333
<i>have been working around</i>
<i>the clock to determine</i>

16
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,916
<i>the cause of an explosion</i>
<i>that occurred yesterday evening</i>

17
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,791
<i>at Narisawa High School</i>
<i>in Narisawa City</i>

18
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,750
<i>As this could have been a</i>
<i>deliberate criminal act</i>

19
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,833
<i>against the school,</i>
<i>investigators are asking</i>

20
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,458
<i>those who were present if</i>
<i>any suspicious individuals</i>

21
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,041

22
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,041
<i>Fortunately, the explosion</i>
<i>occurred after school hours,</i>

23
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,583
<i>and though the intense blast</i>

24
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,500

25
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,875
<i>there have been no reported</i>
<i>casualties.</i>

26
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,750
[SHO] No casualties? What are
they talking about?!

27
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,208
Maybe you were right and
Chronos really DOES have

28
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,625
some kind of influence
over the police and media.

29
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,916
Maybe, but I think I
was just overreacting.

30
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,416
[SHO] No way. I... I mean...

31
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,541
I mean, Mr. Tanaka and
his partner were murdered!

32
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,666
By Chronos'... Zoanoid!

33
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,791
Hold on, don't get so riled up.

34
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,416
Just calm down and
listen to what...

35
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,958
[SHO] I AM calm!

36
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,625
Forget about the explosion, what
happened to the pool of guts

37
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,750
they should have found
at the school?!

38
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,291
This isn't just an oversight!

39
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,541
They're trying to cover up

40
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,875
the fact that two police
officers were murdered!

41
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,791
Sho!

42
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,958
[TETSURO] I'm sure... no...

43
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,416
Actually, I'm positive that
the police and the media

44
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,125
are reporting everything

45
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,166
they know about what
happened yesterday.

46
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:33,041
Look at this.
It's today's paper.

47
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,208
[SHO] While on patrol,

48
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:37,291
two officers were in
a traffic accident?

49
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:41,250
A collision between a truck and
tanker? This is wrong...

50
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,875
[TETSURO]
There was an accident at school,

51
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,791
the cause of which
is still unknown,

52
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,291
and two police
officers are dead.

53
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,708
The TV and newspapers aren't
lying about that at least.

54
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,458
But now we have to assume that
Chronos is destroying evidence

55
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,250
and working behind the scenes to
make the public think

56
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,250
that the school bombing and the
officers deaths are unrelated.

57
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,875
Yeah, but...

58
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,333
since the Zoanoid showed
up at the school like that,

59
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,750
there might have been someone

60
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,416
who saw it fight
with the Guyver.

61
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,875
[TETSURO] There very well
may be, but...

62
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,583
But...
it's not that simple, Sho.

63
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,791
If someone tried reporting this
to the police or the media,

64
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,666
what do you think would happen?

65
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,708
They'd think they were crazy.

66
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,833
They'd turn them
away at the door.

67
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,416
Or even worse, maybe the
police would pin THEM

68
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,291
as a possible suspect.

69
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,333
To anyone on the outside
who doesn't know

70
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,166
about Zoanoids or the Guyver,

71
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,625
what happened yesterday...
it's nothing.

72
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,666
Little news in a big world.

73
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,916
[SHO] That's terrible...
It's just awful!

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,541
By this time next month, I'm
sure people will have forgotten

75
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,208
that anything happened at all.

76
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,833
Chronos has probably been
operating in the shadows

77
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,416
like this for a long time.

78
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,375
Hey, Sho... I don't really
know how to put this,

79
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,500
but it's not your fault that
Tanaka and his partner died.

80
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,666
Don't be so hard on you--
[SHO] Yeah, I know.

81
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,875
It's... just frustrating when

82
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:07,666
I think that things could
have gone differently.

83
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,166
When I think that...

84
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,541
that this could have happened
to you or even Mizuki...

85
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,416
I'm scared.

86
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,583
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that!

87
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,458
I need to stop stressing
out like that.

88
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,916
Uh, it's okay...

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,666
[SHO] I should walk Mizuki
home from school!

90
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,166
[TETSURO] Walk her home? But
the school's shut down...

91
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,208
[SHO] Right, but the student
council is moving their

92
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,458
documents and stuff out of
the council room today.

93
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,291
So all the members are supposed
to be there. See you later!

94
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,833
Hey, Sho, wait up!

95
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,166
<i>[light grunting]</i>

96
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:53,000

now, we're almost finished!

97
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:56,875
Uh... Right...
[Mizuki] Um, is something wrong?

98
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,875
[SHO] Oh, it's nothing...
but after we're done with this,

99
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,083
let me walk you home.

100
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,791
[MIZUKI] Huh?
[SHO] Tetsuro's gonna

101
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,041
get worried if we keep
him waiting for too long.

102
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,041
[MIZUKI] Listen Sho, I'm sorry,

103
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,166
but I don't think I can
go home with you today.

104
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,625
Huh?

105
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:20,083
[yells]

106
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:24,333
It's just... well, you know,
they're letting us use the rooms

107
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,250
at that other school until
repairs are done here and...

108
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,166
So... I still need to talk to
Makishima about that.

109
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,125
Yeah, but Mizuki, you were doing
that all day yesterday.

110
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,958
If you don't come home,
Tetsuro will get worried.

111
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:39,375
Uh... just tell him I'm busy
and I'll be a little late, okay?

112
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,166
See ya!

113
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,875
But... But wait a minute!

114
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,833
[SHO] Mizuki!

115
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,125
Uh...
[Mizuki] What are you doing?

116
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,833
Um, just hold on a sec...
[Mizuki] Sho, that hurts!

117
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,166
[SHO] Wait, it's not
what you think!

118
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,000
[MIZUKI] Oh yeah? If it's
not what I think,

119
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,708
then what are you trying
to do to me?!

120
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,750
Look, I... I'm sorry. It's just,
I'm worried about you!

on here, Segawa?

123
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,958
Makishima...

124
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,416
I don't mean to intrude on a
private conversation...

125
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,583
and I'm sorry if I'm mistaken...

126
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:14,833
but it seems to me that

127
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,125
Segawa didn't care for
your treatment of her.

128
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,416
I'm sorry about that.
Excuse me...

129

What's wrong?

130
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,375
Mr. Tanaka...

131
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:55,500
[TETSURO] Oh, you're done?
Where's Mizuki?

132
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,375
[SHO] Oh, well, she...

133
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,000
[TETSURO] What happened?

134
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,583
[BURGER EMPLOYEE] Hello!
Welcome to Sandy Burger!

135
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,833
Will your order be for here
or to go, Sir?

136
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,750
[TETSURO] I see. Makishima, huh?

137
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,208
Well, listen...

138
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,875
Look I mean, maybe this is
all for the best, you know?

139
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,708
Our enemies are
after the Guyver,

140
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,416
so it'd probably be better if
I stayed away from Mizuki.

141
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,666
That's just an excuse.

142
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,166
No, I mean, it's just that...

143
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,208
Hey!

144
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,750
Say "ah."

145
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,708
Okay, but no pickles, right?

146
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,708
No pickles. C'mon, say "Ahh".

147
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,666
Ahh...

148
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,291
Aw... Just forget about it.

149
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,083
Hey, let me ask you something...
[TETSURO] Yeah?

150
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,291
[SHO] What kind of guy is
Makishima anyway?

151
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,291
You two were in the same class
up until last year, right?

152
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,166
[TETSURO] Well, let me think.
That's tough.

153
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,458
He's got a pretty bad temper...

154
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,250
and it's hard to figure out
what he's thinking sometimes.

155
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,833
[SHO] I thought someone
said he was adopted?

156
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,750
[TETSURO] Yeah, you didn't know?

157
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:58,458
People have been talking about
it for like three years now.

158
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:02,500
His so-called dad is really his
uncle. Supposedly his real dad

159
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,083
lost a lot of money on some
failed business venture

160
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,416
and was skipping town when
his brother showed up and

161
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,916
took care of his business,
his family and everything.

162
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,125
Excuse me. Please pardon
my tardiness...

163
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,333
Commander-in-Chief Guyot.

164
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,000
[GUYOT] You must be Agito.

165
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,666
Risker told me all about you.

166
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,916
I wanted to ask you inspector,

167
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,125
your work hasn't been
too taxing, has it?

168
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,041
No, on the contrary, I've never
felt better in my life.

169
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,291
I'm pleased to hear
that Inspector.

170
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,750
I've been told that you
attend the same school

171
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,958
as the boy who has the Guyver.

172
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,833
Yes.

173
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,666
[BURGER EMPLOYEE] Hello, and
welcome to Sandy Burger!

174
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,500
Uhm... will your order... be
for uh, for here, or to go?

175
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,291
Takeout.

176
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,916
[NOSKOV] If you don't mind.

177
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,958
[SHO] It's getting dark already.

178
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,250
Do you have any
plans for tonight?

179
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,416
[TETSURO] Let me guess.

180
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,208
Your dad's gonna be
working late again,

181
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,791
so you think it'd
be a good idea if

182
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,958
Mizuki and I spent the night at
your place, right?

183
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,958
[SHO] Well, yeah... I mean,
that'd be nice!

184
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:26,375
Damn. Lost again. You say
"that'd be nice",

185
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:30,000
but the look on your face says
"I'm begging you".

186
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,375
Uh, I mean, really it's
just that I think we...

187
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,208
I hate to break it to you,
but I'm afraid you'll be

188
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,791
spending this Saturday
night with US.

189
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,625
[TETSURO] Who are you?
[SHO] Get outta my burger joint,

190
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:40,708
you Chronos creep!

191
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,708
Oh? So you want to fight
me here do you?

192
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,541
That's fine by me... but let me
warn you... if we face off

193
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,875
in a crowded place like this,
it could get rather messy.

194
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,291
[TETSURO] Sho...

195
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,708
[SHO] <i>What should I do?</i>

196
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,541
<i>If I turn into Guyver</i>
<i>and fight him now,</i>

197
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:01,666
<i>it's going to involve a lot of</i>
<i>innocent people. Still...</i>

198
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,583
I suggest you accept
defeat gracefully and

199
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,125
avoid making a scene.

200
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,458
You can sit there and glare
at me all you want,

201
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,125
but that won't change the fact
that there's nowhere to hide

202
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,000
and no way to escape.

203
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,375
Maybe I can't hide,

204
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,791
but if you think there's
no way to escape...

205
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,875
you're wrong... I won't let you

206
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,833
use innocent people in
your plans! GUYVER!

207
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,708
[TETSURO] Gotta go!

208
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,916
Nice...
[GUY] Huh?

209
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,416
Well, he certainly knows
how to gauge a situation.

210
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,958
I'll give him that, at least.

211
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,375
Myumelzee... I'm sending you
his sonic

212
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,333
signature. Trace it
and capture him.

213
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,041
[NOSKOV] Keep an eye on him,

214
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,416
but don't do anything
until I get there.

215
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,333
[TETSURO] Looks like we...
got away, huh?

216
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,208
[SHO] Yeah.

217
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,166
That was insane! You can't just
transform like that

218
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,875
with all those people around!

219
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,375
[SHO] What would you have done?

220
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,750
I have to protect my friends,
don't I?

221
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,125
Are you saying we should
have given up?

222
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,958
But...

223
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,375
[TETSURO] Well, at least it
worked out in the end.

224
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,583
[SHO] I'm sorry.

225
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,750
[TETSURO] So, what are
you going to do now?

226
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,208
[SHO] I'm worried about Mizuki.

227
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,083
I'm gonna go back to
the school and...

228
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,208
[TETSURO] What's wrong?

229
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,375
[SHO] The air... it's vibrating.

230
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:46,375
[building power surge]

231
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,500
[SHO] Watch out!

232
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,291
[SHO] What the hell?!
[MYUMELZEE] Nice dodge, Guyver.

233
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,791
If that had been a direct hit,

234
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,791
it would have been
all over for you.

235
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,083
[SHO] So you're with
Chronos too.

236
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,958
[NOSKOV] I have to applaud
you for your dramatic escape

237
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,125
from the restaurant earlier.

238
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,083
[MYUMELZEE] However...

239
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,708
I'm afraid all you've done

240
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,166
is fallen right into
the palms of our hands.

241
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,250
Then you must be Zoanoids.
Ah man, this sucks!

242
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,291
We're more than just Zoanoids.
We're completely unlike

243
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,708
anything you've
ever seen before!

244
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:23,750
[growling]

245
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,916
[NOSKOV] I am the
hyper-Zoanoid, Noskov!

246
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,041
[MYUMELZEE] I am the
hyper-Zoanoid, Myumelzee!

247
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,291
See you in Hell, Guyver!

248
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:44,291
[Sho screams in pain]

249
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,875
[TETSURO] <i>No way... What</i>
<i>kind of attack is that?</i>

250
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,833
[SHO] Wh..what the hell was
that? I didn't see a thing.

251
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,333
[MYUMELZEE] Hmph!

252
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:59,583
So you were able to survive our
combined sonic wave, huh?

253
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,458
[NOSKOV]
I should have expected as much.

254
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,416
This is going to be
a real challenge.

255
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,708
One more time, Myumelzee!

256
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,000
[MYUMELZEE] Hey, no problem.

257
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,458
It doesn't matter how
hard his shell is.

258
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:14,291
We keep on pounding, it's gotta
crack sooner or later. Watch!

259
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,583
[Tetsuro coughs]

260
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,875
[NOSKOV] That's enough!
We lost him!

261
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,416
[NOSKOV] Don't get carried away!
You'll just complicate things!

262
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,833
[MYUMELZEE] What do you mean?

263
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,666
I just turned a boring mission
into a fun little game!

264
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,041
[NOSKOV] I can't believe it.

265
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,083
Theoretically, we should be
able to smash anything.

266
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,458
How did he withstand our attack?

267
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,250
[SHO] Sound waves?
[TETSURO] Yeah, you saw those

268
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,625
speaker-looking things
on their shoulders, right?

269
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,125
[TETSURO]
I don't know how they work,

270
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,083
but somehow they emit some kind
of low-frequency vibration

271
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,541
that pulverizes
anything in its path.

272
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,250
[SHO] A sound wave cannon, huh?

273
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,625
So, that's why I couldn't
see their attacks.

274
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,500
But how do I fight a
weapon like that?

275
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,833
Hold on. They still have
limitations.

276
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,208
[TETSURO] Look, no matter
how strong it is,

277
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,291
I think it's safe to assume that
a weapon like that would require

278
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,875
a certain amount of time for its
vibrations to destroy a target.

279
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,916
It's probably no more than
a few seconds though.

280
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,875
You think that's enough time
for you to beat them?

281
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,750
[SHO] Tetsuro!

282
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:22,125
[MYUMELZEE] Playtime is over,
Guyver! Let's go!

283
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,416
[SHO] I think I understand.
Take cover and watch me work.

284
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,708
[TETSURO] Yeah... Right!

285
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,583
[MYUMELZEE] Die!

286
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,750
What are you shooting at?
Your aim sucks!

287
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,291
[SHO] That's what you think.

288
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,458
[MYUMELZEE] What?!
[SHO] Now's my chance!

289
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,291
[MYUMELZEE] Not so fast!

290
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,791
Damn!

291
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,833
[Myumelzee screams in pain]

292
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,958
[NOSKOV] Using our own
attacks against us, huh?

293
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:06,000
Not bad, Guyver... but
if you think you've won,

294
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,083
you've got a lot to learn!

295
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:12,708
Now Guyver, cower in fear
before our true power!

296
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,125
Let's do it, Myumelzee!

297
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,791
[TETSURO] Their horns are
glowing. Watch out, Sho.

298
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,458
We don't know what these
guys are capable of.

299
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,500
[SHO] Give it up! I've already
figured out your attacks!

300
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,291
[Sho gasps in surprise]

301
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:40,625
<i>What's... going on?</i>
<i>I... I can't hear anything!</i>

302
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,458
<i>No, it's not that I</i>
<i>can't hear... I...</i>

303
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,750
<i>it's like all the</i>
<i>sound disappeared.</i>

304
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,750
[Sho screams in pain]

305
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,541
<i>Damn... this is bad.</i>
<i>Without sound,</i>

306
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,833
<i>I can't sense their attacks!</i>

307
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,375
<i>Fighting without sound is like</i>

308
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,708
<i>fighting with my eyes closed!</i>

309
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,166
[NOSKOV]
Sound is composed of waves that

310
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,416
vibrate within the
medium of air.

311
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,750
With this horn I can locate all
available sound waves

312
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,333
and create a completely
opposite waveform

313
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:13,125
which I then emit into the air.

314
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,833
The clashing waveforms
negate each other

315
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:20,875
until both are annihilated and
only a sea of silence remains.

316
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,625
[MYUMELZEE LAUGHS]
Are you surprised, Guyver?

317
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,750
Humans first sense danger
by sound, you know.

318
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,500
Now that we've thrown you
into a void of silence,

319
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,208
you're completely helpless.

320
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,208
I guess you can't hit what
you can't hear, huh?

321
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,875
[Sho screams in pain]

322
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,916
[NOSKOV]
You should have given up

323
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,333
while you still had the chance.

324
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,666
[MYUMELZEE] Consider this
payback for my arm.

325
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,333
I'll make you suffer!

326
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:53,166
I'll make you cry out in agony
as I crush you to pieces!

327
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,250
[Sho screams in pain]

328
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,708
[NOSKOV] Come on, Myumelzee.
Stop screwing around!

329
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,041
[MYUMELZEE] Shut up! I'm gonna
break that bastard's arm!

330
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,916
[Sho screams]

331
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,541
[NOSKOV] H..He reversed
my sonic eraser!

332
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,833
[Myumelzee screams]

333
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,458
[NOSKOV] Myumelzee!

334
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,875
[MIZUKI] Wh... What was that?

335
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,500
Mizuki!
[Sho gasps]

336
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,375
[NOSKOV] I am truly sorry, Sir.

337
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,041
I have failed. Myumelzee is...

338
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,458
[GUYOT] Irrelevant.
Listen carefully.

339
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,166
Somewhere near you there
is a girl named Mizuki.

340
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,166
Take her hostage and
get out of there.

341
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,916
[NOSKOV] Huh? Sir!

342
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You have to get out
of here, Mizuki!

343
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,833
Wh..What are you talking about?

344
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,833
Listen, we don't have
time to argue!

345
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,000
[Noskov grunts in pain]

346
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,791
[Mizuki screams in terror]
[SHO] Mizuki!

347
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,041
[TETSURO] Let my sister go,
you son of a bitch!

348
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:28,000
[SHO] Damn it! Come back here!

349
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,458
[TETSURO] I said let her
go, you bastard!

350
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,416
What part of "let her go"
don't you understand?!

351
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,708
[Tetsuro grunts]

352
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,833
[NOSKOV] I have taken the girl
and retreated as commanded, Sir.

353
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:44,166
Now please... send
reinforcements!

354
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,166
[Noskov cries out in
surprise and pain]

355
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,625
No... it can't be...

356
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,541
[MAKISHIMA] You're not going to
get away with those two.

357
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,375
I'm not letting that rat
have his way.

358
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,541
Now is not the time.

359
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,750
[SHO] Mizuki!

360
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,250
Noskov? But how...

361
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,208
[TETSURO] Sho!

362
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,333
[SHO] Tetsuro! Where's Mizuki?

363
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,500
[MAKISHIMA] Relax.

364
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,041
Your girlfriend is safe.

365
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,916
[SHO] A... Guyver?

366
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,875
[TETSURO] Yeah, he rescued us
from that Zoanoid.

367
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,958
[MAKISHIMA] I'm sure our
paths will cross again.

368
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,666
I look forward to that day...
Guyver I.

369
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:44,000
[SHO] The third Guyver...
who the heck is he?

370
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:50,750
[RISKER] Guyver III...
[GUYOT] Really?

371
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,416
[RISKER] It's finally happened.

372
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,833
All three units
have been unleashed.

373
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,708
[NARRATOR] With nerves
at their breaking point

374
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:33,625
and conflicting feelings
seizing their hearts,

375
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:37,500
Sho and Tetsuro are summoned
to fight once again.

376
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,333
The anti-Guyver Zoanoid
prepares for battle

377
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:45,083
as the emotions of a fallen man
flare into a bitter hatred.

378
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:48,291
One man lashes out at the world
that has betrayed him,

379
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:51,583
as another seeks to bring his
battle to an end.

380
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:54,125
What awaits at the end
of the fight?

381
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:57,708
Next:
"Beyond the Desperate Battle"
