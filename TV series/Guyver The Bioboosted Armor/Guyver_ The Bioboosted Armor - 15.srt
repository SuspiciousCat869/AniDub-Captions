1
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,416
[MIZUKI] Wow! Really? I'll have
to give it a try some time.

2
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,833
Sure! You can borrow mine as
long as you give it back!

3
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:10,000
[TETSURO] Hey, Mizuki.
[MIZUKI] Tetsu!

4
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,833
Sorry I kept you waiting.
Are you ready to go?

5
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,708
I guess this is the first time
in a while

6
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,666
that we've all had dinner
together, huh?

7
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,666
We should give Sho's
dad a call too.

8
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,166
Leave it to me! I'll give
you guys a meal to remember!

9
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,958
Just sit back and relax!

10
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,208
Aw man, it's morning already?

11
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:52,083
You must be beat from keeping
watch all night.

12
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:55,666
I can handle it now, you
need to get some rest.

13
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,958
It's okay. I'm not tired yet.
Besides, I can't transform.

14
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,541
What am I good for if I
don t do this huh?

15
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,416
C'mon, Sho...

16
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,666
Hey, guys! Why dontcha' come on
down and get your breakfast?

17
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,833
[TETSURO] Wow!

18
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,791
I wasn't expecting this much!

19
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,541
[SHIZU] If we hadn t been in
such a rush,

20
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:17,958
I could have brought more.

21
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,000
[TETSURO] What, are you kidding
me? This is fantastic!

22
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:24,166
Well, don't be shy!
Everyone help yourself!

23
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,625
[MAKISHIMA]
Murakami, I have a question.

24
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,666
You mentioned some
secret about the Guyver.

25
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,583
Ya mind elaborating?

26
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,583
I was in Chronos myself for a
while,

27
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:46,208
but there are still a lot
of things I don't know.

28
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:49,000
All right then, if you think
you're ready,

29
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,041
I'll tell you everything I know,

30
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,916
the truth behind the Guyver
units,

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,166
the Creators and the Zoanoids,

32
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,416
including the truth behind
humankind itself.

33
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,250
There was a race of alien
creatures

34
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,041
who came to Earth from far
beyond our galaxy,

35
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,666
 "The Creators".

36
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,666
We know now that
they manipulated

37
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,833
the Earth's ecosystem

38
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,333
over the course of
several billion years

39
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:17,291
in an attempt to give rise to a
very specific kind of life form.

40
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,083
They needed something with
high intelligence,

41
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,916
strong survival instincts

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,291
and the ability to adapt to
any environment.

43
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,416
A fearsome, aggressive life-form
meant to serve as a weapon.

44
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,875
After countless years,

45
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,333
a creature that could serve

46
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:32,208
as a base for that life-form
was created.

47
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,416
And those creatures were us,

48
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,125
all of humankind.

49
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,916
[MIZUKI]
You expect me to buy that?!

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,750
You're telling us that we're
nothing

51
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,125
but a bunch of living weapons

52
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,916
created by some alien race?!
That's what people are?!

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,458
It was difficult for me to
accept as well, but it's true.

54
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:54,875
Now that you mention it,

55
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,875
Guyot talked about the
exact same thing,

56
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,958
that we were all made as the
basis

57
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,333
for a series of bioweapons.

58
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:07,666
It makes sense. After all, human
history is built on conflict.

59
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,875
We seem to have a
powerful inclination

60
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,125
towards war and brutality.

61
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,500
Perhaps we're subconsciously
fulfilling our purpose.

62
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:21,000
[MIZUKI] <i>What's going on here?</i>
<i>It's like they don't even care!</i>

63
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,458
<i>How can they just sit there</i>

64
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,333
<i>and talk about this like</i>
<i>it's nothing?!</i>

65
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,250
<i>It's sick! They've lost</i>
<i>their minds!</i>

66
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:32,333
<i>Or maybe not. Maybe I'm the</i>
<i>one who's losing it.</i>

67
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,833
You see, the Zoanoids are just
normal humans

68
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,041
who have been "optimized"
for combat.

69
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,791
Optimization is the process of

70
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,166
artificially inducing
genetic mutations

71
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,416
in order to create a new form,
or augment a specific ability.

72
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,333
Human attributes allow for the
possibility of transformation

73
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,875
from their default into
a secondary form.

74
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,541
However, all Zoanoids are
subject to

75
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,166
the will of the Zoalords.

76
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,708
Like Guyot and Barcas,

77
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,791
they can command large
numbers of Zoanoids

78
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,000
through
psychic manipulation.

79
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,500
And you have the same powers,
because you were a prototype

80
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,833
for Guyot's Zoalord form.

81
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,166
That's correct. I was able
to use those powers to

82
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,250
destroy the Enzyme IIs,

83
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,166
even if I couldn't break Barcas'
psychic control over them.

84
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,291
Just as Zoanoids are forced to
submit to the Zoalords,

85
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,750
the Zoalords are genetically
programmed to demonstrate

86
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,291
absolute obedience to
the Creators.

87
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,333
But now, it's all history.
In the end,

88
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,208
humans were never
used in combat.

89
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,166
Shortly after completing their
experiment,

90
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,458
the Creators departed
from the Earth.

91
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,125
Perhaps some interstellar war

92
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,833
that they were involved in had
drawn to a close,

93
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,916
or perhaps they were influenced
by some outside force.

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,666
Unfortunately, their intentions
have been buried

95
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,458
beneath the sands of time.

96
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,625
Scarcely had it been created,
when mankind was abandoned

97
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,666
before its true purpose
could be realized.

98
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,333
Left without the guiding
hands of the Creators,

99
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:09,291
optimized Zoanoids crossbred
with normal humans

100
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:13,000
and bit by bit their
legacy faded away.

101
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,875
But there's still a chance that
some of them survived.

102
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,833
The monsters spoken of in
folklore throughout the world

103
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,708
may have been the descendants
of those very Zoanoids.

104
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,625
Then what about the Guyvers?

105
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,416
We already know that they're
organic weapons.

106
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,250
Were they created using
humans as a base too?

107
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,208
[MURAKAMI]
No, they're different.

108
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:38,541
Originally, the Guyvers were
to be used by the Creators.

109
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,125
Creators?!

110
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:43,166
Believe it or not, they were
standard equipment.

111
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,708
As you know, the Guyver unit
fits itself to its host's body,

112
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,333
then optimizes their
conditioning

113
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,708
and enhances their physical
capabilities.

114
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,125
Even if the Creators had been

115
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,125
a group of many different
alien races,

116
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,833
the units would be able to adapt
to each of their needs.

117
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,791
It may be the most versatile
weapon ever created.

118
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,583
And then the Creators
had an idea.

119
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:06,458
What if they equipped a human
being with the Guyver unit?

120
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,833
They were probably interested to
see what would happen

121
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,250
if two different living weapons
were combined.

122
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,208
It was like a game to them.

123
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,708
However, they got far more
than they bargained for.

124
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,041
The bioboosted human,

125
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,500
exhibited power that was
hundreds of times greater

126
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,958
than when the Creators
themselves donned the unit.

127
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:27,125
But what was more terrifying to
them than anything else

128
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,666
was the fact that the Guyver
unit freed its host

129
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,041
from their mental control.

130
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,041
They had accidentally created a
monster

131
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,458
far more powerful
than the Zoanoids

132
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:39,250
that was no longer subject to
its master's commands.

133
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,833
The Creators called it
abnormal, nonstandard,

134
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:48,041
"out of control", or in their
language, "Guyver."

135
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,875
Their curiosity lead them to
discover

136
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,166
something even more terrifying.

137
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,125
If a Zoalord were to equip one
of the Guyver units,

138
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:59,666
it would become a super-being,
with a power far surpassing

139
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,000
that of the Creators'
themselves.

140
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,291
That's incredible...

141
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,416
That may be why the Creators
suddenly abandoned the planet.

142
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,333
They were running away.

143
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,000
Everything else I've told you
is based on information

144
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,125
Professor Yamamura and Chronos
procured from various ruins

145
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,416
throughout the world.

146
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,583
However, the last piece

147
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,708
about Zoalords equipping
the Guyver units

148
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,333
is most likely a secret
even to Chronos.

149
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,791
Other than myself, the one man
who may know is Richard Guyot.

150
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,750
Guyot knows?

151
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,833
Then, that must mean his
goal is to...

152
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:33,375
Right, he wants to have
a Guyver unit of his own.

153
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,958
Then he'll use it to destroy the
other Zoalords.

154
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:39,000
He'll rule this world with the
power of a god.

155
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,041
[SHIRAI] Good news.

156
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,291
I've finished the analysis
and the results indicate

157
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,458
that the unit does possess the
properties you spoke of.

158
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,791
Really? Is that so?

159
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:54,000
Indeed, but I'm afraid I
will require more time

160
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,458
in order to determine how

161
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:59,041
we're going to execute the
specifics of the operation.

162
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,500
Attend to it immediately, and
tell no one of your findings.

163
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,083
[SHIRAI] Of course.

164
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:08,583
Listen, you must ensure that Dr.
Barcas doesn't suspect anything.

165
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,333
[GUYOT] <i>I have a feeling that</i>
<i>old man is</i>

166
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,375
<i>catching onto my plan.</i>

167
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:16,041
<i>I bet he really came to Japan</i>
<i>to keep an eye on me.</i>

168
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,625
<i>If Yamamura knew the secret of</i>
<i>the Guyver units,</i>

169
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,166
<i>then I'm sure the test</i>
<i>subject also knew.</i>

170
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,541
<i>And that s why they targeted</i>
<i>me in the first place.</i>

171
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,416
<i>Murakami knows too much.</i>

172
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,375
<i>If he opens his mouth at</i>
<i>the wrong time,</i>

173
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:32,458
<i>Barcas might learn the truth.</i>
<i>If that happens, I'm finished.</i>

174
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:36,833
<i>Why does this have to happen</i>
<i>now? I'm so close!</i>

175
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,500
<i>Just a little while longer and</i>

176
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,083
<i>I'll be able to separate a</i>
<i>Guyver unit from its host!</i>

177
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,916
<i>It can be done, I'm sure of it!</i>

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,208
<i>But first I have to deal with</i>
<i>him.</i>

179
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,166
<i>He's a threat as</i>
<i>long as he lives.</i>

180
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,958
<i>I have no choice but to take</i>
<i>matters into my own hands</i>

181
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,000
<i>and eliminate</i>
<i>him personally!</i>

182
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:03,958
Mizuki?

183
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,791
[MIZUKI] I just need to take a
little walk, okay?

184
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,000
[TETSURO]
All right, but don't go too far!

185
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,458
[MIZUKI] <i>I can't take this</i>
<i>anymore!</i>

186
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,791
<i>I've had enough of those</i>
<i>crazy stories!</i>

187
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,750
<i>I feel like I'm losing my mind!</i>

188
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,291
<i>How can Tetsuro and Sho keep a</i>
<i>straight face</i>

189
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,791
<i>in a situation like this?!</i>

190
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,750
<i>How can they act like this</i>
<i>is all right?!</i>

191
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,041
<i>It's like they</i>
<i>don't even care!</i>

192
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,500
I can't take it. I just
want to go home.

193
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,083
I want to go home... [sobs]

194
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,708
[MURAKAMI]
Once Guyot discovered the secret

195
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,333
behind the Guyver units,

196
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,791
he feared that the other
Zoaloards would find out too.

197
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,833
So he eliminated every member of
the staff

198
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,375
that was involved in the
study of the units.

199
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,708
However, Professor Yamamura
escaped his notice,

200
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,500
since he was only a private
advisor

201
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,458
for one of the staff members.

202
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,041
He corresponded with the
other researchers,

203
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,541
sSoon discovering that the
"unit" in question

204
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,000
was actually an object that he
had uncovered in the ruins

205
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,958
at Mount Minakami several
years earlier.

206
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,166
If someone were to
obtain the unit,

207
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,208
the professor knew they would
have enough power

208
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,416
to oppose Chronos.

209
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,416
It was the only way to stand
up to their strength.

210
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,833
But the only problem was it
could fall

211
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,375
into the hands of Guyot or
the other Zoalords.

212
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:39,750
I see. That's why the zoalord
test subjects sided

213
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,291
with the professor.

214
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,916
You wanted to finish off Guyot
before he had the chance to

215
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,375
obtain one of the Guyver units.

216
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,166
[MURAKAMI]
But we failed.

217
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,208
The team of Zoalords overpowered
us

218
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,541
before we could put
up much of a fight.

219
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,125
I had the fewest injuries, so
the professor and the others

220
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,791
gave their lives to protect me

221
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,583
while I escaped to
the desert above.

222
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,166
With Chronos
thinking I was dead,

223
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,125
I returned to Japan and used my
connections as a journalist

224
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,083
to track their movements.

225
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,333
I had been searching leads
on the Guyver units

226
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:12,541
when I found that they were
actually right under my nose.

227
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,958
I knew that Guyot would be
coming for the units,

228
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,958
so I had to get to them first.

229
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,583
I would secure all three, then
equip one myself

230
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,250
and launch an attack on Chronos.

231
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:25,250
It was a mission that I alone
had been entrusted with.

232
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:29,500
But then, it all slipped
out of my control.

233
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,250
I'm sure you know how the
rest of the story goes.

234
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,000
By the time I caught up to the
units, it was too late.

235
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,750
All three of them had been
unleashed,

236
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,833
and one of them had
been lost forever.

237
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:46,375
But wait, if all three units
have already found hosts,

238
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,625
then we shouldn't
have to worry about

239
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,666
Guyot getting his hands
on one anymore.

240
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,125
So, in a way, the problem has

241
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,666
already been taken
care of, right?

242
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,666
I wish that were the case.

243
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,333
[TETSURO] What's wrong?

244
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,583
I was just thinking, Mizuki's
been gone a while.

245
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,333
Yeah, I guess she has, huh?

246
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,583
It's no surprise.

247
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,625
All of this has come as quite
a shock to her.

248
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,125
[TETSURO] Yeah, I can't really
blame her for getting upset.

249
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,833
She kinda got hit with a
lot of things at once.

250
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,125
I guess we should have told
her

251
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,750
about all this stuff sooner,
huh? What's up?

252
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,833
I'm going to see if
I can find her.

253
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,000
[MURAKAMI] <i>Sho can be pretty</i>
<i>predictable sometimes.</i>

254
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,416
Murakami...

255
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,875
What's the matter?

256
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,791
It's him!

257
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,875
He's here! Right behind us!

258
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,125
Good morning, gentlemen.

259
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,166
[TETSURO] G..Guyot!

260
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,583
[APTOM] <i>Well, I'll be damned.</i>

261
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,375
<i>The Commander decided to</i>
<i>show up after all.</i>

262
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,041
<i>This is getting very</i>
<i>interesting.</i>

263
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:58,041
So it's you. You're the test
subject that got away.

264
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:02,125
That's right. We meet at
last, Richard Guyot!

265
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:06,375
[BARCAS] Just as I expected.
Good work, Aptom.

266
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,625
For now, I'd like you to stay
hidden and await further orders.

267
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,833
As you wish, Sir. Understood.

268
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,041
[BARCAS] Patience, Richard.

269
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,541
There's no need for you to
get so worked up

270
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,583
over a mere test subject.

271
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,333
If my suspicions are right,

272
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,875
I'm afraid Murakami will be the
least of your worries.

273
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,375
[GUYOT] Arrogant fool!

274
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,208
Do you really think a miserable
little prototype like you

275
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,166
can stand up to the real thing?!

276
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,125
I'll show you the power
of a true Zoalord!

277
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,125
[GUYOT] What's the matter? Lost
your nerve?

278
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,208
You're not giving up
already, are you?

279
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,291
Guyver Bioboost!

280
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,208
[MAKISHIMA] Who said
anything about giving up?

281
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,958
Actually, I'm glad you came!

282
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,041
You saved us the trouble of
going all the way

283
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,458
to Relic's Point to
finish you off.

284
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:05,791
[GUYOT] If nothing else,

285
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,541
it seems that your tongue is
as sharp as ever.

286
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,666
But let's not be too
hasty, Agito.

287
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,416
I brought these two gentlemen to
keep you entertained.

288
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,125
[MAKISHIMA] Enzyme II, huh?

289
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,458
[GUYOT] Listen up, you
contemptuous traitor.

290
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:24,583
I'll personally tear the control
metal from your pathetic carcass

291
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:25,875
after these two finish you off!

292
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,375
[MURAKAMI]
Not gonna happen, Guyot!

293
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,666
I have the powers of a
Zoalord, just like you!

294
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,416
[MURAKAMI]
I'll send you to Hell,

295
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,458
even if I have to drag
you there myself!

296
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:43,458
[SHO] C'mon, she's gotta be
around here somewhere,

297
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,125
doesn t she?

298
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,875
Now where... Hey!

299
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:53,541
What the heck are you doing
all the way out here?

300
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,541
Did you get lost? Everyone's
worried about you.

301
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,083
C'mon, let's go!

302
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:03,041
Go away. I just want to go home!

303
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:07,041
[SHO] Hey, hold on!
Mizuki, wait! Wait!

304
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:10,791
[MIZUKI] I said leave me alone!
I'm going home, all right?!

305
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,875
Hey, what's gotten
into you? What's wrong?

306
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,083
Think about it for
a second, Sho!

307
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,666
Mizuki, I...

308
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,708
[MIZUKI]
I was attacked by monsters,

309
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,875
kidnapped and locked up.

310
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:27,500
I find out you and Makishima are
practically monsters yourselves.

311
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,791
And then you tell me that
humans are nothing

312
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,250
but tools made for
some alien war?!

313
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,416
Enough is enough!

314
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:42,958
Why, Sho? Why is all of this
happening to us, huh?

315
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,625
What did we do to deserve
all this suffering?!

316
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,458
Just a few weeks ago, we were
nothing

317
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:51,166
but normal high school students!

318
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,500
Why did everything have to fall
apart?! It's not fair!

319
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,416
Why?! Tell me why!

320
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:04,708
I want my life back,
like before. [sobs]

321
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,541
[MIZUKI] Sho...

322
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,666
[SHO]
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Mizuki!

323
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,916
It's all my fault for getting
you guys involved in this.

324
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,208
[SHO] I'll do something.

325
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,791
I promise I'll make
it better somehow!

326
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,833
[SHO] Come on, let's get back
to the others, okay?

327
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,166
[MIZUKI] Okay...

328
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,416
[MAKISHIMA] <i>If I could just fire</i>
<i>off my mega-smasher,</i>

329
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,958
<i>I could take them both</i>
<i>out in one shot.</i>

330
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,333
<i>But they're way too fast.</i>
<i>They'd tear me up</i>

331
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,750
<i>while I was charging my</i>
<i>energy.</i>

332
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,791
[Murakami yells]

333
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,833
[GUYOT] Is that the best you can
do? Pathetic!

334
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,750
Here, let me show
you how it's done!

335
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,500
Well? What do you think
of my gravity bullets?

336
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,875
Rather effective, even at
only 20% output.

337
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,666
[MURAKAMI] Damn it...

338
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,083
[GUYOT] Insolence!
[Murakamki screams in pain]

339
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,708
[MAKISHIMA] Murakami!

340
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,333
[Makashima groans in pain]

341
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,041
[MURAKAMI] No!

342
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,166
[GUYOT] Looks like the end of
the road for you.

343
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,916
It was fun, but playtime's over.

344
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,791
Don't despair. Consider it an
honor to die

345
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:56,500
at the hands of a true Zoalord.

346
00:19:56,583 --> 00:20:00,625
[Makashima screams in pain]
[Enzyme II chuckles evilly]

347
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:04,666
[Enzyme II roars in pain]

348
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,291
[GUYOT] Damn, out of time since
I pulled them out

349
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,000
before their optimizations
were complete.

350
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,166
[MURAKAMI] Now!
[Guyot screams in pain]

351
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,916
[MURAKAMI] Makishima, go!

352
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,833
[MAKISHIMA] Right!

353
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,916
[MAKISHIMA]
You're finished, Guyot!

354
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,916
[Guyot screams in denial]

355
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,958
[MURAKAMI] Did you get him?
[MAKISHIMA] I think so.

356
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,291
I was only able to
fire from one side,

357
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,916
but there's no way he could
survive a direct hit like that.

358
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,041
[footsteps]

359
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:11,458
[GUYOT]
You dirty son of a bitch...

360
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,750
[MURAKAMI] How?

361
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:17,875
[GUYOT] Now you've really pissed
me off, you filthy maggots!

362
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,166
Prepare to be annihilated!

363
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,291
I'll send every last one
of you to Hell!

364
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,375
Sho, wait! Isn't that?

365
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,791
[SHO] No! The others are
still up there!

366
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,041
[NARRATOR] A soul gone
mad with bitterness...

367
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:35,416
A wounded heart lamenting a
harsh reality...

368
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,750
He must protect Mizuki.

369
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,166
Pierced by the twisted
arm of a Zoanoid,

370
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,500
traces of kindness flash
through Sho's dying heart.

371
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:47,500
With all of his strength, he
cries "Guyver" once more.

372
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:52,000
As his heart opens to the truth,
his hopes become a reality.

373
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:55,458
Next time: "Arise, Guyver I"
