Your primary objective is to
recover the units at all costs.

And then like, there's the issue

Is there anything else we
need to cover?

It looks a little
scuffed up here...

161
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,875
but it's nothing too serious.

162
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,375
[UNIT COMMANDER] Let
me see. All right, listen.

163
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,791
There are two more units.

164
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,416
We've got to hurry!

165
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,791
What do you think it is?

166
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:24,666
You got me. But you know...
it kinda looks like...

167
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:29,291
Well, kinda like a UFO, right?
A little one, maybe?

168
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:33,875
Hey, Tetsuro, be careful! I
mean, it's glowing, isn't it?

169
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,833
What if it caused that
big explosion?

170
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:40,083
It's fine. It'd be damaged if
it had just gone off.

171
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,791
It just got blown over here.

172
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:49,291
It's lighter than it looks.
Can't be a mecha, right?

173
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:53,416
Come on man, cut it out. What if
the owner comes looking for it? 

174
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,625
So? That doesn't mean we
can't goof around with it

175
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,375
until whoever
it is shows up.

176
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,666
Tetsuro!

177
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,083
[SHO]
Let's just leave it here, okay?

178
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,500
I have a bad feeling about this.

179
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,041
Finders, keepers!

180
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:12,041
I think... I must've pushed
a switch or something.

181
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,375
[building reaction noise]

182
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,958
Sho? What's wrong?!

183
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,083
It's like... it's alive!

184
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:36,750
[Sho screams]

185
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:47,666
[SHO] <i>I can't... breathe.</i>
<i>Something's tearing</i>

186
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,416
<i>into my body...</i>
<i>crawling under my skin...</i>

187
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,458
Sho...

188
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,208
Hey!

189
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:06,083
[SHO] Tetsuro...
help me... please!

190
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,750
[Sho screams]

191
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,166
Sho!

192
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,166
[Tetsuro gasps]

193
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,333
[GREGOLE] What are you
doing here boy?

194
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,541
Wh-Wh-Who are you guys?!

195
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,916
[UNIT COMMANDER]
He's seen you, Gregole.

196
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,125
[GREGOLE] Then we have no
choice. Eliminate him!

197
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,791

[TETSURO] Don't kill me!

201
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,125
[GREGOLE] Huh?
[TETSURO] Huh?

202
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,583
Wh-What the hell is that?

203
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,166
[GREGOLE] Who are you?

[awed gasp]

205
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,833
[GREGOLE] You wanna fight?
I don't know who you are,

206
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,375
but if you're stupid
enough to get in my way,

207
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,375
I'll tear you to pieces!

208
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,875
[GREGOLE]
All right, twerp...

209
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,833
You wanna test your
strength against ME?!

210
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,916

I don't believe it! That scrawny
thing broke his arms?

[Gregole lets out a
death rattle]

218

Retreat! Let's get the
hell out of here!

219

220
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,041
Sho... is that you?

221
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,875
[SHO] Y-Yeah...

222
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:20,875
D-Did I do that?

223
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,250
Look, it's just melting away.

224
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,583
But wait, Sho... What
happened to your body?

225
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,125
[SHO] My body?

226
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,041
[SHO] M-My hand!
What's going on?

227
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,041
[SHO]
Wh-What is that thing?

228
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,875
[SHO] Is that... ME?

229
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,750
Hey, Sho...

230
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:51,083

[NARRATOR] The strange
being that merged with Sho

235
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,833
sunk beneath the water...

236
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:35,458
But that was nothing
but an illusion.

237
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:38,208
A mysterious organization
moves into action

238
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,833
to recover the 2nd
and 3rd units.

239

An abandoned building stands
looming over the bay.

the facade of everyday life

241

begins to emerge
from the shadows,

242
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:52,500
and bears its deadly
fangs at Sho.

of Chronos"
