00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,916
That's odd. What is it?

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,791
[SIN] About six months ago,

3
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,833
a magnetic anomaly was observed
deep within the Rocky Mountains.

4
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,750
The team we sent
out to investigate

5
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,500
discovered this object there.

6
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,916
I appreciate the explanation,
but what is it?

7
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,916
I'm afraid we've been unable to
determine that just yet.

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,458
All we've been able to confirm
through our analysis

9
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,583
is that this object has the
same organic makeup

10
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:35,958
that the Relic did.

11
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,291
Of course, that could mean any
number of things.

12
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,083
But one theory is that
a part of the Relic

13
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,250
became spatially displaced

14
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,416
during the explosion over
Mount Minakami

15
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,875
and the object is a remaining
piece of the Relic.

16
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,541
You think part of the
Relic survived?!

17
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,166
I had the object transported

18
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,708
to the Dead Sea base as
quickly as possible.

19
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:55,208
In addition to helping us with
the optimization process,

20
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,458
I think your analysis of this
would be highly valuable.

Boss, we've found where

the
object is located.

84
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,708
The Dead Sea.

85
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,375
The Dead Sea? So that would mean

86
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,666
it's on the border of Israel
and Jordan then?

87

That's correct.

It was first discovered in the
Rocky Mountains.

According to our reports,

90

it was then taken to a base in

Furthermore, we have recovered
a number of Relic fragments

00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,583
At this point, the only thing I
can tell you about the object

159
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,958
is that it appears to
be organic.

160
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,041
[BARCAS] So this is it?

161
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,875
[RESEARCHER] Its outer surface
is too resilient

162
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,250
for us to penetrate
without damaging it

163
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,333
and something inside is
continuously emitting

164
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,708
a high-level magnetic pulse.

165
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,666
Not only have we been shut out,

166
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,083
but we've also been unable to
examine the interior.

167
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,333
Excuse me, Sir?

168
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,416
Just stand back and watch.

169
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,791
Dr. Barcas has the strongest
psychic power

170
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,500
of all the Zoalords.

171
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,625
If he can't see inside,
then no one can.

172
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,125
[SIN] Well, Doctor?

173
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,291
[BARCAS]
I can't make anything out.

174
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:32,375
Even with <i>my</i> imaging abilities,
I can only get a faint glimpse.

175
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,083
However, I did learn this much:

176
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,708
Whatever is inside
this blasted thing

177
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,791
is undergoing
a metamorphosis.

178
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,708
A metamorphosis?

179
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:44,666
And although faint, I also
sensed a brain-like activity.

180
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,416
What on earth...

181
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,333
Actually, "chrysalis" may be a
more accurate term

182
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,041
than I expected.

183
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,833
Regardless, something about
this thing

184
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,958
just doesn't sit well with me.

185
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,916
It seems to have a very
ominous aura about it.

186
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,083
Tell the researchers that

187
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,625
we'll try to dismantle it
in the morning.

188
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:06,541
I'll see to it personally that
we get to the bottom of this

189
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,583
before it's too late.

190
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,208
[water gurgling]

191
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,291
[SHO] Power...

192
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:28,166
I need power,
a much greater power.

193
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,833
He's too strong.

194
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,791
He's completely different than
anything we've faced before.

195
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:41,041
With the way I am now, I don't
even stand a chance.

196
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,166
With the way I am now, I can't
protect Tetsuro and Mizuki.

197
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,541
I can't protect anyone!

198
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,875
If I want to win,
I need more power.

199
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,541
I need something even stronger
than the Guyver.

200
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,958
[APTOM] Who's there?

201
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,375
Who would be following ME?

202
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,416
Good a place as any, I guess.

203
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,541
So, are you gonna show
yourself now, or what?

204
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,666
[ZX-TOLE] What's the hurry,
Aptom? You scared?

205
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,500
[APTOM] There you are.
[ZX-Tole chuckles]

206
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,583
ZX-Tole!

207
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,958
I see, you know, I thought
I smelled a rat.

208
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,166
So, what do you want with me?

209
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,000
[ZX-TOLE] I want revenge!

210
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,208
You killed my friends and
made off with my leg,

211
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:59,041
you filthy son of a bitch!

212
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,458
You think you've got the
strength to face me?

213
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,416
Oh, I'm strong enough.

214
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,208
I ve been reborn to
take you down!

215
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,083
[APTOM] What?! A new form?

216
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,458
This must be Barcas' work.

217
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,625
[ZX-TOLE]
This is the end, Aptom!

218
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,791
A high frequency blade?!

219
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,333
What was that?
[WOMAN] Some kind of explosion?

220
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,583
[APTOM] I see, so you've
acquired the abilities

221
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,458
of you old teammates, huh?

222
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,333
I guess that means we're even.

223
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,958
[ZX-Tole laughs]

224
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:50,166
[ZX-TOLE] Enough screwing
around. time for you to die!

225
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,875
[APTOM] Not bad, Dr. Barcas.

226
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,916
You may have outdone
yourself this time.

227
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,916
He's as powerful as me.

228
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,833
[PURGSTALL] Yes, make the
arrangements immediately.

229
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,875
I want you to block off
all major roadways,

230
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,208
prohibit everyone in the city
from leaving their homes.

231
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,625
We've no choice, the city is

232
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,250
under martial law.

233
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,541
[sirens blaring]
[TETSURO] Martial law?

234
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:14,041
Once again, the current
situation is extremely dangerous

235
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,416
and the entire city has been
placed on lockdown

236
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,916
until further notice.
[TETSURO] Do you have any idea

237
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,458
what's going on?
[TV] Those in the Shinjuku area

238
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:20,416
Well, they're not saying much,
[TV] should take caution...

239
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,875
but it sounds like some Zoanoids

240
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,083
are fighting it
out or something.

241
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,458
Fighting? That doesn't
make any sense.

242
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,458
Zoanoids are programmed during
optimization

243
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,750
to have complete
loyalty to Chronos.

244
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,958
They couldn't turn on each
other if they wanted to.

245
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,458
But even if they did,

246
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,583
don't you think putting the
whole city under martial law

247
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,458
is a bit of an overreaction?

248
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,333
Now, if there was something else
fighting with the Zoanoids,

249
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,291
that might be a different story.

250
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:49,333
Wait! What if this means
that Sho's come back?!

251
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,083
[MIZUKI] Come on, we've gotta
let Sho know that we're here!

252
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,916
Mizuki, wait!

253
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,541
Hold on, where do you
think you're going?

254
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,375
What d'you mean?

255
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,791
If we don't go look for Sho,

256
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,791
then how will he know where
we're hiding?!

257
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,333
Let's go!

258
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,083
[TETSURO]
Get a hold of yourself.

259
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,166
We don't know if that's Sho
fighting or not.

260
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,958
Yeah, but...

261
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,000
What if he's out there
looking for us?

262
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,875
You're right, let's
check it out.

263
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,666
[NATSUKI] Hey, wait!

264
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,916
It's probably swarming with
Chronos guys out there!

265
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,083
What if you picked up by the
Regulation Bureau?

266
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,958
We'll have to take our chances.

267
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,000
Sorry, Natsuki, thanks
for everything.

268
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,583
[NATSUKI] I said, wait!

269
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:36,958
Okay, you win,

270
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,458
but you have to let me come
along too, all right?

271
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,875
Are you sure?
[NATSUKI] Of course I am.

272
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,833
After all, I know this area a
lot better than you two.

273
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,666
[NATSUKI] This way!

274
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,416
<i>Sho... It has to be Sho, right?</i>

275
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,750
[ZX-TOLE]
Come on Aptom,

276
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,541
I thought you were
"highly evolved"!

277
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,541
The "ultimate battle creature"!

278
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,291
[APTOM] I don't get it!

279
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,916
Even if he's been repotimized

280
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,208
with the powers of all five
hyper-Zoanoids,

281
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,833
he still shouldn't be
this strong.

282
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,750
Eat this!

283
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,458
[ZX-TOLE] You still
don't get it, do you?

284
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,791
Attacks like that have
no effect!

285
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,791
You got more?!

286
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,666
[APTOM] Didn't work?!

287
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,750
[ZX-TOLE] Did you think such a
feeble trick

288
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,583
would work against ME?

289
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:46,208
Tell ya what, let me show
you how it's done!

290
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,666
[APTOM] He's too strong!

291
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:57,791
[Aptom roars in pain]
[ZX-Tole chuckles]

292
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:01,291
[APTOM] [laughs gleefully]
You've gotten sloppy, ZX-Tole!

293
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,416
It's over! Our bodies have
already begun to fuse.

294
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,250
You can't escape by
cutting off a limb this time.

295
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,375
Say hello to your
friends inside!

296
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:14,541
[ZX-Tole laughs]
You talk too much.

297
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,166
You're the one who's
gotten sloppy!

298
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,208
[Aptom screams in intense pain]

299
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,250
[APTOM] That was Derzerb's heat
discharge attack!

300
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,250
But how? I was trying, but I
couldn't absorb his body?

301
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,750
[ZX-TOLE] You look surprised.
Let me explain.

302
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:35,875
I've been given antibodies

303
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,625
designed to repel
your cell invasions.

304
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,000
I also carry a virus that

305
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:43,250
makes you lose control of your
regenerative powers.

306
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,708
[APTOM]
What?! That's impossible!

307
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,958
It's insane enough that you can
acquire so many powers

308
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,875
through optimization alone,

309
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:50,958
but you've also been equipped

310
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,375
with a specialized virus
and antibodies?

311
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,208
There's no way a normal
hyper-Zoanoid

312
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,958
could handle all of that!

313
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,125
[ZX-TOLE] You'll find out soon
enough if I'm bluffing.

314
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,958
But I will tell you one thing:

315
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,541
I'm no longer a hyper-Zoanoid.

316
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,333
Like you, I've become a beast
without a name,

317
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,291
a Lost Number!

318
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,916
I've traded my pride
as a hyper-Zoanoid

319
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,416
for the powers I needed to hunt
down and destroy you!

320
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,041
[APTOM] What? At what price?

321
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,166
[ZX-TOLE]
It was a high price to pay,

322
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,375
but I'll go to any length to
avenge my friends

323
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,208
and the disgrace I've suffered!

324
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,416
[APTOM] Avenge your friends?

325
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,458
[excited and worried crowd]

326
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,041
There they are!

327
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,333
They look really powerful!

328
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,583
It's hard to tell from here,

329
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,541
but it looks like the smaller
one is losing.

330
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,958
You think that could be Sho?

331
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,333
Yes! It has to be him!

332
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,333
Look, he hasn't been using any
of his weapons to fight back!

333
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,708
Because if a Guyver does a big
attack in a city like this,

334
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,125
he'll injure a lot of
innocent people.

335
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:56,208
That's why he won't fight back!
He can't be a Zoanoid!

336
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,416
Only Sho would think like that!

337
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,250
[APTOM] Normally, wounds like
these would have healed by now.

338
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,958
Looks like he was right.

339
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,458
Damn, I'm out of options.

340
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,166
[ZX-TOLE]
You're finished, Aptom.

341
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,916
There's no escape!
Accept your fate!

342
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,333
[Aptom roars in pain]

343
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,583
[sirens wailing]

344
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,458
Sho!

345
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:33,583
SHO!

346
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,291
[a single heartbeat]

347
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,166
[SHO] Mizuki...

348
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:32,166
[NARRATOR] Overcoming countless
hardships,

349
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,125
entrusted with limitless hopes,

350
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:39,041
a young hero's soul gives life
to the vessel of a god.

351
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,375
In order to protect his friends,

352
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:44,833
in order to answer the prayers
of his one true love,

353
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:48,583
he rises once again from
the ashes of despair.

354
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:53,166
Next time, witness the ultimate
power unleashed in:

355
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,750
"Come Forth, Gigantic!"
