00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,166
[TETSURO] Wake up guys!

2
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,333
Sho's missing!

3
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:09,500
[MURAKAMI] Huh? Ah!

4
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,666
I can't find him anywhere!

5
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,416
You're kidding me!

6
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,500
[MIZUKI] What's going on?
[TETSURO] Sho's gone!

7
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:20,958
[TETSURO] Sorry, he must
have snuck out the window

8
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,083
when I dozed off for a second.

9
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,083
[MIZUKI] What?!

10
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:28,083
Grandfather look! Agito left
us this letter.

11
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,333
[MAKISHIMA] <i>I am going to Mount</i>
<i>Minakami with Fukamachi.</i>

13
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,041
[MIZUKI] Well, I m worried.

14
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,333
What were they thinking?!
They'll be killed!

15
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,666
I bet that team of Zoanoids is
waiting to ambush them!

16
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,250
God damn it, Sho. Couldn't
you have at least waited

17
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,083
until your injuries healed?

18
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:47,250
Well, the good news is he has
Makishima to help him out.

19
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,250
If nothing else, at
least he knows his way

20
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,666
around Relic's Point.
[TETSURO] But those Zoanoids...

21
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,375
[MURAKAMI]
All we can do now is have faith

22
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,208
and wait for them to come back.

23

Sho...

26
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,458
Hm? Is there something wrong?

27
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,583
We're not supposed to switch
shifts for another hour or so.

28

Dad, it's me!

I'm here to save you...
One last time.

31
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,625
[FUMIO] Sho!

32
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,291
I'm so glad you're all right,

33
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,541
but you've got to
be more careful!

34
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,041
We'll be just fine.

35
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,291
Makishima knows Relic's Point
like the back of his hand.

(alarm siren goes off)

C'mon, let's go.

38
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,166
Right...

39
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,375
[MAKISHIMA] We'd better hurry.

40
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,250

[MAKISHIMA] Let's do this!

00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,166
[SHO] Right!

00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:33,125
Yeah... What about you though?
You're not hurt, are you?

51
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,458
[SHO] I'm fine. As long
as it's nothing serious,

52
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,333
the Guyver can regenerate
itself pretty fast.

Oh, I see. [groans]

Looks like things are going
just as we planned.

63

Shouldn't you go ahead and
dispatch the five elites?

[BARCAS] Don't worry.
They're already in position.

Watch and learn!

66
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:28,416
They're nothing but insolent
children in monster suits.

67

We've let them run
wild long enough.

It's time to put an end to this.

00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,625
[MAKISHIMA] So you finally came.

Sorry to keep you waiting!

[MAKISHIMA] Where are
the other two vermin?

74
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,833
[ZX-TOLE] Well, let's just
say it was a bad idea

75
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,583
for you to run off and
leave your friends behind.

76

[SHO] You bastard!

77
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,666
[MAKISHIMA]
Listen, Fukamachi,

78
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,583
I'll stay and take
care of these three.

79
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,541
You take your father
and go help the others

80
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,500
before it's too late, all right?

81
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,833
[SHO] All right, good luck.

82
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,166
[MAKISHIMA]
Even on my own,

83
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,625
I'm more than enough
to deal with you.

84
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,500
[ZX-TOLE] What a shame. It looks
like you still don't get it.

You're no match for us!

86
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,541
[MAKISHIMA]
We'll see about that!

87
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:43,625
[TETSURO] Is something wrong?
Hey, Murakami?

[Makashima yells]

93
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,208
[MAKISHIMA] Did I get him?
[ZX-TOLE] Not bad, Guyver.

94
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,208
Looks like you're
in top form today.

95
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,125
[MAKISHIMA] He recovered
even after a direct hit

96
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,791
from my pressure cannon!

97
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,458
It looks like pitting
ZX-Tole against Guyver III

98
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,750
was the right
decision after all.

99
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,875
Bring up the display
of the two Zoanoids

100
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,333
that were sent to their hideout.

101
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,875
[COMPUTER OPERATOR] Sir.

102
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,000
Something's bothers me.

103
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,333
I didn't question your
decision when you suggested

104
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,125
we send Gaster
and Derzerb to deal

105
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,458
with our targets in the woods,

106
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,250
but if our aim is
to capture them,

107
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,541
I fail to see why

108
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,958
normal Zoanoids would
not have sufficed.

109
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,708
Why did you insist on
sending hyper-Zoanoids?

110
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,041
I doubt they'll put
up much of a fight.

111
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,125
[GUYOT]
No, you're probably right.

112
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,375
But for some reason I have a bad
feeling about Mr. Murakami.

113
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,166
Damn it! They just had to wait
until the Guyvers were gone!

114
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,500
[MIZUKI] How did they even
find out about this place?

115
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,000
They must have known
about it all along

116
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,666
and were waiting to
make their move.

117
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,875
It looks like we
underestimated them.

118
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,916
We're in pretty bad shape.

119
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,083
But I'm more worried
about Sho and Makishima.

120
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:30,041
They'll make it back
safely. I'm sure.

121
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,208
Wait a second Murakami,
I'm confused.

122
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,833
How did you know we were
being attacked by Zoanoids?

123
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,666

Sho, do you think you could
let me down for a sec?

I think I need to take
a little break.

[FUMIO]
It seems like only yesterday

131
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,500
when I was carrying
you around on MY back.

132
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,458
Now, all of a sudden I'm the
one getting a ride.

133
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:26,875
It may sound kind of pathetic,
but in a way, I'm glad.

134
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:34,500
[SHO] Dad... Listen, I...
I'm sorry I never told you.

135
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,958
I just... It...

136
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,833
No, it's all right, Son.
I understand.

137
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,000
You didn't say anything

138
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,291
because you were
worried about me, right?

139

[SHO] Dad...

140
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,208
[FUMIO]
I know it must have been tough,

141
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,041
but I'm really proud
of you, you know.

142
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,625
I was too busy to notice,

143
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,833
but all of a sudden
you've really grown up.

144

You're a strong boy, Sho.

145
00:10:56,833 --> 00:11:00,166
And I'm sure you'll grow
into a strong man too.

146

[SHO] Dad! [sobs]

Hey, come on. It's a compliment.
You don't have to cry!

148
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:21,291
Stand up, Sho. You have an
important job to do, right?

149
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,875
Your friends are
counting on you.

150
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:34,166
[FUMIO] It's all right. I guess
you're still a kid after all.

151
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,000
You're still my boy.

152

[SHO] You're right, Dad, my
friends are counting on me.
