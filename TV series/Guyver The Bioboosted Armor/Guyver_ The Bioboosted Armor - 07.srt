1
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,125
<i>Enzyme, you've outlived</i>
<i>your usefulness. Destruct!</i>

00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,500
[Enzyme growls]

3
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,166
[Sho growls]

4
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:18,583
Sho... SHO!

5
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,750
He's dead...

6
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,083
[SOLDIER]
The Guyver and Enzyme

7
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,041
have both been
completely obliterated.

8
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,875
All units will now
return to base.

9
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:37,875
No way... This can't be...

10
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:55,458
[MAKISHIMA] Now all the
pieces are in place.

11
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,333
[traffic noise]

12
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,583
[GUYOT] So this is it?
[SOLDIER] Yes, Sir.

13
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,250
This is the control metal we
removed from Guyver I's head

14
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,333
before it was destroyed.

15
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,708
[GUYOT] It's unfortunate that I
was unable to see it in action

16
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,833
before it met its demise.

17
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,041
At any rate, if we
can unlock the secrets

18
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,333
of the control metal,
then we can proceed

19
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,125
with our plans without
the Guyver's interference.

20
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,416
Now, as for Guyver II...

21
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,708
[Risker gasps quietly]

22
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,375
Since one of our men
EQUIPPED the unit,

23
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:42,791
we were unable to conduct
a proper analysis of it.

24
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,625
[concerned sigh]

25
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:49,625
However, I can still analyze
THIS one as much as I like.

26
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,000
Finally, this will bring
me one step closer

27
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,166
to their knowledge,
to their power.

28
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,750
Hmm?

29
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,041
Are your optimizations
done already?

30
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,333
[ZERBEBUTH] Yeah, the data
from your Guyver II

31
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,000
gave us some insight
into its weaknesses.

32
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,666
So now, they've transformed me

33
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,583
into an even more
powerful hyper-Zoanoid.

34
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:18,000
I've transcended the Guyver.
It's no threat to me at all.

35
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,708
And I owe it all to my
old rival, Risker.

36
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,958
Or perhaps I should say
"former rival."

37
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,708
[struggling sounds]

38
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:28,875
[TETSURO] Let me go!

39
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:32,250
[SOLDIER] Shut up and walk!

40
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,208
[GUYOT] I see. So you're the
highschool student

41
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,375
who was with the boy
commanding Guyver I.

42
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,958
I'm Richard Guyot,
Commander-in-Chief of Chronos.

43
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,958
You son of a bitch!
You killed Sho!

44
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,666
I want my friend back!
You murderer!

45
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,666
[grunts]

46
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,583
There's no need to be so rough.

47
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,375
After all, he IS our
esteemed guest.

48
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,458
Sir!

49
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,791
[groan of pain]

50
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,000
If it's any consolation,

51
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,166
I regret that your friend

52
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,958
had to meet such a
sudden, violent demise.

53
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,291
Unfortunately, Enzyme's
desire for revenge

54
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,333
was way out of my control.

55
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,708
But you know, if this Sho,
or whoever,

56
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,083
had not been SO insistent
on defying us,

57
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,916
we could have resolved things
in a more peaceful manner.

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,500
[TETSURO] You bastard!

59
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:23,125
Just kill me already!
Just like you killed Sho!

60
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,583
[GUYOT] I'm afraid you're too
valuable to dispose of just yet.

61
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,083
You see, I need to ask you about

62
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:31,958
the third Guyver that
rescued you the other day.

63
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:35,291
<i>I get it now.</i>
<i>Since Guyver III rescued us,</i>

64
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,250
<i>he must think I know</i>
<i>its identity.</i>

65
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,375
<i>That's probably why he</i>
<i>hasn't killed me yet.</i>

66
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,208
Screw you!

67
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,416
[GUYOT] Well, it's no matter if
you don't want to talk now.

68
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,916
You and I can have a nice
little chat later.

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,041
And after that's settled...

70
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,833
I've got it, why
don't we have you

71
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,750
become our next
Zoanoid test subject?

72
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,083
[TETSURO] What do you mean?

73
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,625
I want you to see something.

74
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:57,958
[curious sound]

75
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,041
Those... Those are!

76
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,041
[GUYOT]
Those are all Zoanoids

77
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,875
in varying stages
of development.

78
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,666
Unfortunately, more
than half of them

79
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,958
don't make it through their
"optimizations" ...alive.

80
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,791
[scared noises]

81
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,166
The escapee that made
off with the Guyver unit

82
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,666
that you found near your school
was one of our test subjects.

83
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,333
[TETSURO] <i>Holy shit! That means</i>
<i>those things aren't monsters</i>

84
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,541
<i>that take on human form,</i>

85
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,541
<i>but normal people who have</i>
<i>been turned INTO monsters!</i>

86
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,000
[winces in distress]

87
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:37,333
You bastards! Don't you have
any regard for human life?!

88
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,458
Those who cannot
withstand optimization

89
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,458
are defective products.

90
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,791
Such insignificant creatures
have no right to live.

91
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,208
[TETSURO] That's sick!

92
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,416
Why are you making so many
of those monsters?

93
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,166
What the hell are you
trying to accomplish?!

94
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,541
Good question.

95
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,916
Since you're our newest
test subject, I'll tell you.

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,708
At this point, it won't be long

97
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,375
until we begin mass-producing
our creations...

98
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,416
At headquarters, they're using
the data we've acquired here

99
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,833
to develop newer, more powerful
Zoanoids as we speak.

100
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,208
But that's only the beginning.

101
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,958
Once we've produced
enough Zoanoids,

102
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,458
we'll secretly deploy them
to the ends of the Earth,

103
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,041
perfectly disguised
as normal humans.

104
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,958
[roars]

105
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:26,000
Then, after those Zoanoids
have worked their way

106
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,125
into key positions in the
world's governments,

107
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,625
we will put our plan into action

108
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:33,291
and they will reveal their
true forms all at once!

109
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,750
Can you imagine it?
Without warning,

110
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:44,916
the world will be thrown into

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,083
a state of terror as
invincible monsters,

112
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,458
more powerful than any weapon
the world has ever seen,

113
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,166
suddenly appear within
the command centers

114
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,083
of every nation.

115
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,916
In the ensuing chaos,
the world's militaries

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,791
and governments will
beg for our mercy.

117
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,833
Then the world will be ours!

118
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,291
It will be ruled by Chronos!

119
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,708
This global transformation

120
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:10,041
will usher in a new era
for all of mankind!

121
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,000
It is the birth of
a new humanity,

122
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,916
and a great step forward in
the evolution of man!

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,958
Evolution of man?!
A "NEW humanity"?!

124
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:23,583
Correct! They will be the new
rulers of planet Earth!

125
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,416
You mean those monsters?!

126
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,458
Those repulsive killing
machines?!

127
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,541
[GUYOT] Yes!

128
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:33,916
These Zoanoids represent what
mankind should strive to become!

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,625
Why, you ask?

130
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,500
Because humans were
originally developed

131
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,875
as the base material from which
all Zoanoids would be created!

132
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,500
Wait...

133
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:48,791
Zoanoids... are made of people?

134
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:55,916

135

[WOMAN] Hello, Taga residence.

136
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:01,291
Oh, hi, Mizuki!
Hold on a second, okay?

137
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:09,666
Natsuki! You've got a call.
I'll just leave it here.

138
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,666
[NATSUKI] All right!

139
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,041
Hi, this is Natsuki.

140
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:20,875
Oh, hey Mizuki. What's up?

141
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,375
Huh? Tetsuro?

142
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,541
No, I haven't see him today.
Did something happen?

143
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,833
[MIZUKI] Well, he hasn't
come home yet

144
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,416
and when I tried calling
Sho's place

145
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,375
his dad said he
wasn't home either.

146
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,250
Sho too, huh?

147
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,875
Well, they're
probably just hanging

148
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,250
or going to the
movies or something.

149
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,708
It'll be fine. I'm sure it's
nothing to worry about.

150
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,375
Yeah, I guess you're right.

151
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:49,666
Well... Sorry for calling you
so late like this.

152
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:55,041
Yeah. Right. Yeah,
okay, goodnight then.

[pounding continues]

160
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,208
[TETSURO] Damn it...
Isn't anyone there?

161
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:01,125
Open up!

162
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,000
You ain't making a test subject
out of ME, you monsters!

163
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,708
When Sho gets here, he'll...

164
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:22,083
Sho, you'd still be alive right
now if it wasn't for me.

165
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:26,458
Back then... I never should
have picked that thing up.

166
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:32,041
[TETSURO] <i>Sho! Sho, you mind if</i>
<i>I talk to you for a second?</i>

167
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,625
It's lighter than it looks.
Can't be a mecha, right?

168
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:45,875
Come on, man, cut it out.

169
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,166
What if the owner comes
looking for it?

170
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,458
Let's just leave it here, okay?
I have a bad feeling about this.

171

[Sho gasps]

I think... I must've pushed
a switch or something.

[yelps]

175
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:08,250
It's all my fault.
I'm sorry!

176
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,916
I didn't know this
would happen, Sho!

[grunts]

178

00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,791
[SOLDIER 2] What? That's odd.

185
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,000
Come on! Piece of junk!

186
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,625
What's wrong?

187
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,333
Try accessing it again.

188
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,833
Right...

[quiet power hum]

Huh?
[HEINRICK] What's wrong?

191
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,833
The control metal is emitting a
faint electromagnetic pulse.

192
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,083
That's bizarre.

193
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:16,041
It should be completely
inactive at this point.

194

Hey! Look!

[surprised gasp]

196
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:23,250
Heinrick, it looks like it's
trying to activate again!

197
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,375
But how is this...
even possible?!

198
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,166
Something is starting
to ooze out of it!

199
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,625
It looks like it's trying to
form something. My God...

[wriggling noises]

201
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,625
We'd better contact the

00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,125
Right!

Why the alarm?

218
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,375
We suddenly stopped
receiving transmissions

00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,375
from the security camera
in the storage room.

It's the Guyver!
It's launching an attack

235
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,000
in the storage area of
block number 7, Sir!

236
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,333
Just as I thought,  Guyver III
is making its move.

237
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,791
Go take care of him Zerbebuth!
You'd better not lose this time!

Sir.

What a perfect opportunity

240
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,500
to show him what
we're really made of.

241
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,125
If we can capture him now,
we'll have all three units back.

[computer beeping]
Speak!

-[GUYOT] What?!
-It's gotten to the Enyzmes

[chokes]
[GUYOT] Guyver III?

248
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,333
Then the one that appeared in
block number 7 must be...

249
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,458
Block number 5, computer
surveillance restored, Sir.

250

[GUYOT] Guyver I!

from block number 4
to block number 5, Sir.

253
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,041
It's breaking
through the barriers

254
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,625
and continuing its attack.

[MAKISHIMA] If these anti-Guyver
prototypes are allowed to live,

258
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,083
it could prove
troublesome for me later.

tenacious, huh?

fine with me.

264

for what you did to me!

Hah! How do you like that?

00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:56,500
Your puny little megasmasher
has nothing on this!

You can't even touch me.

276
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,416
Those spines
generate a forcefield

277
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,833
that negates the effect
of your pathetic weapons.

278
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,583
I've been redesigned to counter
all of your techniques!

I'm the perfect anti-Guyver
Zoanoid!

See you in Hell, Guyver!

You won't be coming
back this time!

couldn't stop Guyver I!

[ZERBEBUTH] Huh? Risker! Thank
God! You've gotta help me!

00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,458
There's still time! Please!

297
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,000
Take me to the optimization
tank before it's too late!

00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:16,083
I believe you said
I was your rival?

299
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,416
Actually, your "former rival".

300
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,083
[chuckles] That's nothing but a
pathetic self-delusion.

301
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,750
An arrogant little
piece of garbage

302
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,875
like you can't even
BEGIN to rival my power.
