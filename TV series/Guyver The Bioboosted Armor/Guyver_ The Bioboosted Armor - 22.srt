1
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,791
[ODAGIRI] Hurry! It's
only a matter of time

2
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,916
before this level
collapses as well!

3
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,958
[SHO] I prepared some
space inside the Relic

4
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,291
where all of you can stay.

5
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,041
It looks like the
earthquakes are getting worse,

6
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,541
so you'd better hurry!

7
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,333
[SHO] As soon as the
energy is charged,

8
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,333
I'll launch the ship and
take us to the surface!

9
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,375
[SOLDIER] Man, where the hell
are our replacements?

10
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,750
We shoulda been relieved
an hour ago, Thomson.

11
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,166
Yeah, I know, but what if
they had a big accident

12
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,500
down there, or something?

13
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,250
Either way, all we can do
is keep waiting around.

14
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:47,416
I just hope someone gets here
before the storm hits.

15
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,375
Whoa, what was that? Lightning?

16
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,083
This must be Mount Minakami.

17
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,166
Strange, there seems to be a
massive convergence of energy

18
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,625
coming from somewhere
beneath the base.

19
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,291
But there's something else too.

20
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,291
I'm sensing a large scale
distortion in gravity.

21
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,291
Do you think it's him?

22
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,875
There's no doubt. Guyot is
responsible for this.

23
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,916
[Guyot laughs]

24
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,416
[GUYOT] How do you like
that, Archanfel?

25
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,583
This is my ultimate attack!
A 7000 exa-ton quasi-black hole!

26
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,833
What's the matter?

27
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,250
It looks like you're
having trouble

28
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,333
keeping up your force field.

29
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,791
That's what you get for
underestimating my power!

30
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,916
[BARCAS] <i>Archanfel!</i>

31
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,750
Stop it now, Richard!
This is madness!

32
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,541
[GUYOT] So there you are, you
senile old goat.

33
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,958
I was wondering where you were.

34
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,833
You know, you made this all
possible.

35
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:42,041
You made me the most powerful
Zoalord ever known!

36
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,416
You fool! If I had
known you would use it

37
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,208
for your own selfish desires,

38
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,291
I wouldn't have given you
that power at all!

39
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,875
How dare you turn against
Lord Archanfel?!

40
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,666
Do you realize what would happen

41
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,000
if the black hole is allowed to
continue growing like this?

42
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,875
It will cause irrevocable
damage to the entire planet!

43
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,791
[GUYOT]
Ha! Don't lecture me, old man.

44
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,583
I know the power I wield.

45
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,250
[BARCAS] Then why are
you letting this go on?!

46
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,708
Neutralize it!

47
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,333
[GUYOT] Is that all you wanted?

48
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,000
Do it!

49
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,750
[GUYOT]
Shut up and stay out of my way!

50
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,208
I won't be neutralizing
anything!

51
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,958
Quite the contrary,
I'm letting it build!

52
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,916
I will see Archanfel fall,

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,583
no matter how many souls
fall with him!

54
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,958
You imbecile!
If it comes to that,

55
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,041
then the black hole
will consume you!

56
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,666
[GUYOT] So what? [laughs]

57
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,833
If I can't finish him off,
I'm as good as dead!

58
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,916
I might as well take
him with me!

59
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,083
[GUYOT] Begone, Archanfel!

60
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:49,291
Find your fate beyond
the event horizon!

61
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:04,291
[ODAGIRI] Come on! Just a
little bit farther!

62
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,750
Something feels really weird
all of the sudden.

63
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,291
[Mizuki screams]

64
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,166
I'm floating!

65
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,750
Mizuki!

66
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,083
[ODAGIRI] What in the world?

67
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,375
<i>What is this?</i>

68
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,958
What fearsome strength!

69
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,500
I had no idea he could
command such power!

70
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,458
Look! Even the clouds
are being affected!

71
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,625
[PURGSTALL]
Surely, you're mistaken.

72
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,583
This can't be his work!

73
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,291
I had heard rumors that
Guyot was the strongest

74
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,875
of the Zoalords, but
this is beyond belief.

75
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,208
I know that he can
control gravity,

76
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,333
but is it really possible
for him to affect it

77
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,958
on such a large scale?

78
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,083
I'm afraid so.

79
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,083
If he calls on
the forbidden power,

80
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,958
there's no limit to
what he can do.

81
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,208
[PURGSTALL] Forbidden power? You
mean the quasi-black hole?

82
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,916
Guyot, you're a fool!

83
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,250
If you keep this up, you're
going to kill us all.

84
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,916
Who could you possibly be facing

85
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,458
that would force you to
unleash such power?

86
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,041
[SIN] No, it couldn't be...

87
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,208
[GUYOT] This is the end!

88
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:44,125
Begone, Archanfel!

89
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,125
[ARCHANFEL] No!

90
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:09,458
[Archanfel screams]

91
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,458
Archanfel, no!

92
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,583
[GUYOT] I did it... [laughs]

93
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,791
I actually did it!

94
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,666
[BARCAS] I can't believe it!

95
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,333
[GUYOT] Help me out, old man.

96
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,875
The black hole's grown
beyond my control.

97
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:27,250
It's going to take both of
us to neutralize it.

98
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,083
[BARCAS] <i>He expects my help</i>
<i>after what he's done?!</i>

99
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,875
[GUYOT]
Do it! Unless you'd rather die.

100
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,875
[GUYOT] Ready?

101
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,708
[BARCAS] Yes.

102
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,458
[GUYOT] Fire!

103
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,666
It's no use! It's grown too
large for us to control!

104
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,708
[GUYOT] Bah! Try it again!

105
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:23,083
[GUYOT] FIRE!

106
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,916
Vanish, damn you!

107
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,291
[MURAKAMI]
<i>It must have been Guyot,</i>

108
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,416
<i>but where did he get</i>
<i>power like that?</i>

109
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,583
It's gone now.

110
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,541
[BARCAS] <i>I can't believe it.</i>

111
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:33,791
<i>Even with its size, he was able</i>
<i>to banish the black hole.</i>

112
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:43,041
[Guyot laughs]

113
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,125
I won! I did it!

114
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:50,083
I, Richard Guyot, have
defeated Archanfel!

115
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,791
No one can stop me now! No one!

116
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:57,750
[Guyot continues to laughs]

117
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,750
[BARCAS] <i>Unbelievable!</i>

118
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,583
[TETSURO] I don't understand.
What just happened?

119
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,291
[ODAGIRI] I'm not sure,

120
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,583
but I know we can't afford to
be standing about! Let's go!

121
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,500
[EVERYONE] Right!

122
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,333
Everyone, watch out!

123
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,708
Oh man, now what's going on?

124
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,625
He's come for us.

125
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,875
It's Guyot!

126
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:07,875
[GUYOT] You?! What the hell do
you think you're doing here?

127
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,333
I see, so they've been
hiding you, huh?

128
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:18,041
That explains why I haven't
been able to track you down.

129
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:22,416
You've been right under my
nose the entire time.

130
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
[laughs]

131
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,833
<i>Damn! We were so close!</i>

132
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,000
Doctor, stand back.

133
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,291
I'll try to hold him off
as long as I can.

134
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,625
In the meantime, try to get
everyone inside the Relic.

135
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,208
[ODAGIRI]
Murakami, are you sure?

136
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,125
[MURAKAMI] I'm fine, just take
care of the others.

137
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,791
You can't!

138
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,708
Don't do it, Murakami! I mean...

139
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,208
Your body won't be able
to handle it.

140
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,666
[MURAKAMI] Is it still possible
for me to transform?

141
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,666
[ODAGIRI] I imagine you
could do it once more,

142
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,916
but your lifespan will be
drastically reduced

143
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,958
in the process.

144
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,958
One more time, huh?

145
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,875
Hey, thanks for everything.

146
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,708
You take good care of
Sho, all right?

147
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:12,791
Mizuki...

148
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,000
[MURAKAMI] What's wrong Guyot?

149
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,458
You don't look so
hot. Outta gas?

150
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,166
[GUYOT]
Shut up, bastard prototype!

151
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,041
Spare me the bravado!

152
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,000
I don't know what's
going on up there,

153
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,916
but it looks like it's taken
quite a toll on you.

154
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,291
I have a feeling
you're not so tough

155
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,416
now that you've used up
your gravity spheres.

156
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,916
I bet I could take you down
without even breakin' a sweat!

157
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,500
Come on! I think it's about
time we settle the score,

158
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,875
once and for all!

159
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,875
[GUYOT] Enough!

160
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,708
[MAKISHIMA]
Stand back, Murakami.

161
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,541
Let me handle this one.
You take care of the others.

162
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,625
Master Agito!

163
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,208
[ODAGIRI] Makishima...

164
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,291
[MAKISHIMA] If you want to talk
about settling scores,

165
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,666
I think it's high time we took
care of a few of our own.

166
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,833
Isn't that right, Guyot?

167
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,958
[GUYOT] You're here too?

168
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,041
I see, it's only natural.

169
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:08,625
[Guyot begins to laugh]

170
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,125
[MAKISHIMA]
Did I miss something funny,

171
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,250
or are you just happy to see me?

172
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,833
[GUYOT] Oh, I'm happy all right.

173
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:18,166
[Guyot continues to laugh]

174
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:26,083
In fact, I don't think I've
ever been happier!

175
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,750
And it's all thanks
to you, Agito!

176
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:33,041
Come to me now, Unit Remover!

177
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,791
[SHIRAI] The Remover's
activating on its own!

178
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,958
[Guyot laughs]

179
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,333
[SHO] No, it can't be!

180
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,458
What is that?

181
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,833
It looks like it
might be that thing

182
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,541
that was missing from the ship!

183
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:15,583
[Guyot continues to laugh]

184
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,625
Guyot's charging it with
his life force.

185
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,166
It could be some kind of weapon!

186
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,541
Don't let your guard
down, Makishima.

187
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,083
It looks like he
might be getting ready

188
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,916
to fire off a shot.

189
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,625
[MAKISHIMA] Then, I guess I'll
just have to hack his arm off

190
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,208
before he can attack!

191
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,500
[SHO] Makishima, no! Stay back!

192
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,833
[Makishima lets out
a battle cry]

193
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,125
[MURAKAMI] Makishima!

194
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:08,625
[GUYOT] Damn it, didn't have
a sufficient charge.

195
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:12,333
Master Agito...
What's going on, Doctor?

196
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,250
I'm not sure, but that device

197
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,750
seems to have the power to
unequip the Guyver armor.

198
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,000
[SHO]
Unfortunately, it's something

199
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,083
much more dangerous than that.

200
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,625
[MIZUKI] Sho?

201
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,416
[SHO] It's called a Remover.

202
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,250
I learned about it from the
Relic's main computer.

203
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,500
It deletes the user data stored
in the control metal's memory.

204
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,458
So, it doesn't just
unequip the Guyver,

205
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,833
it completely separates it
from its host.

206
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,375
[MAKISHIMA] What?!

207
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,750
[SHO] You have to avoid that
thing at all costs, Makishima!

208
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,833
If you suffer a direct hit,

209
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,166
your control metal
will shut down

210
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,000
and the Guyver will return
to its original state,

211
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,541
like it was before you
initialized it.

212
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,208
[MURAKAMI]
<i>Now it all makes sense.</i>

213
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,000
<i>Thats why Guyot stayed</i>
<i>in Japan,</i>

214
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,291
<i>even after all the units</i>
<i>were released.</i>

215
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:54,291
<i>He was waiting for a chance to</i>
<i>get his hands on that thing.</i>

216
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,583
[MURAKAMI] Listen, I'll
try to hold him back.

217
00:16:58,666 --> 00:16:59,833
Use this as a chance to

218
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,916
get yourself and the
others inside the Relic.

219
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,333
[MAKISHIMA]
Can you handle this alone?

220
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,916
You're going to get
yourself killed!

221
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,625
Just do as I say, all right? We
have two priorities right now.

222
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,500
The first is to get everyone
inside the Relic

223
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,666
so we can bring down the base
and get the hell out of here.

224
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,125
The second...

225
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,500
is to prevent Guyot from

226
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,375
getting his hands on
the bioboosted armor,

227
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,250
no matter what the cost!
[MAKISHIMA] I understand...

228
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,166
Even if you have to
leave me behind,

229
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,041
move out as soon as the
Relic is charged.

230
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,208
I'll try to meet up
with you later.

231
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,125
[GUYOT] Sorry to keep you
waiting so long,

232
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:33,041
but thanks for giving me time
to get a re-charge!

233
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
This is it, Agito!

234
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,250
You've decieved me for
the last time!

235
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,333
Let's see how tough you are

236
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,666
after I've taken
your Guyver unit!

237
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,333
[MURAKMAI] You haven't won yet!

238
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:49,791
[GUYOT] You just don't know
when to die, do you?

239
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,500
Guyot, I'll stop you from
taking his Guyver

240
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,541
even if it costs me my life!
[GUYOT] Oh?

241
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,333
Theriomorph!

242
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,125
I... I can't transform!

243
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,708
Oh, Murakami...

244
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,750
[GUYOT]
You miserable little worm!

245
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,458
A guinea pig like you

246
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:14,458
has no right to stand
before a perfect specimen!

247
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:18,000
[MIZUKI] Murakami!

248
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,958
[GUYOT]
Your dummy crystal is resonating

249
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,833
at the same frequency
as my Zoacrystal.

250
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,166
I can paralyze you at
my every whim,

251
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,666
and you can't even raise
a finger to stop me!

252
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,791
No! Stop!

253
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,458
[Murakami screams in pain]

254
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:42,083
[GUYOT] I've seen about all
I can stomach of you.

255
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:45,083
These should finish you
off for good!

256
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,833
[MURAKAMI] Gravity bullets?!

257
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,833
He still has enough strength
to use those?!

258
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,041
[GUYOT] Time to die!

259
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,041
[MAKISHIMA] Odagiri! Doctor!

260
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,291
[cries of concern]

261
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,916
[SHO] You bastard!
What have you done?!

262
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:14,250
[GUYOT] You're just delaying the
inevitable, you useless maggot.

263
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:18,416
But that's fine with me. I'll
kill you all if I have to!

264
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:25,291
So you can still stand.
Tough bastard.

265
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,375
This isn't over...

266
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:34,375
I'll kill you, Guyot!
I swear it! Theriomoprh!

267
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,000
[MIZUKI] <i>This is it...</i>

268
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,833
<i>This the end, his final</i>
<i>transformation.</i>

269
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:04,208
[GUYOT] I don't understand.
You were finished!

270
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,041
How did you ever
overcome the effects

271
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,333
of the crystal's resonance?

272
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,250
Damn it! Why won't you die?!

273
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,666
[MURAKAMI]
I can't let it end here!

274
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,000
No matter how powerful you are,

275
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,708
I will find the strength
to oppose you!

276
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,583
I have got protect those

277
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,958
who will carry on this
fight after I'm gone!

278
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,583
Doctor...
[MIZUKI] What should we do now?

279
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,666
[ODAGIRI] Hurry, please.
You have to get

280
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,166
everyone inside the Relic.
[MAKISHIMA] But I...

281
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,625
It's all right, you have to
leave me and Murakami behind.

282
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,833
Murakami is willing to give up
everything to save you.

283
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,833
His sacrifice mustn't
be in vain.

284
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,125
[GUYOT] You bastard!

285
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,500
<i>They're going inside the Relic!</i>

286
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,750
<i>What the hell's going on here?</i>

287
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,916
[MURAKAMI] It has begun.

288
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:15,333
[SHO] All right, energy
replenishment is complete.

289
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,166
Activate thrusters!

290
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,875
[GUYOT] The Relic, it's moving!

291
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,458
[SHO] Get ready! I'm taking
the ship to the surface!

292
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,125
[GUYOT] <i>I can't believe it!</i>

293
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,916
<i>Those bastards actually found a</i>
<i>way to launch the Relic.</i>

294
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,833
[MURAKAMI] Guyot!

295
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,083
[Guyot yells in surprise]

296
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,750
[Murakami lets out a battle cry]

297
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,916
[NARRATOR]
The long-dormant spacecraft

298
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,708
soars into the sky
above Mount Minakami,

299
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:37,541
bringing down Relic's Point
as it rises.

300
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,750
The Guyver I becomes the target
of the Unit Remover,

301
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:44,250
as he risks his life to
protect Murakami.

302
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:47,291
Meanwhile, the Twelve Zoalords
spring into action

303
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:49,708
and launch an attack
of their own.

304
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:53,916
Next time:
"Ray of Annihilation"
