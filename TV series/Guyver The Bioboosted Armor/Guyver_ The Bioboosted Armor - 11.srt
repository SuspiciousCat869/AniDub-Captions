1
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,916
[SHO] Hello? Dad?

2
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,583
I can't hear you.
Is something wrong?

3
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,666
[FUMIO] Wait,
what are you doing?

4
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,541
No, stop!

5
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,333
Take them away.

6
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,500
[GUYOT'S VOICE] <i>Dyme!</i>
<i>Release them, immediately!</i>

7
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,958
[DYME] Commander Guyot?

8
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,375
[GUYOT'S VOICE] <i>Release them!</i>

9
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,458
[APTOM] Now die!

10
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:23,625
What?!

11
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,833
[APTOM] Damn it!
[GUYOT] <i>We have secured</i>

12
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,541
<i>Fumio Fukamachi</i> and
the Segawa siblings.

13
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:36,125
<i>The operation is a success.</i>
<i>Withdraw immediately.</i>

14
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,333
[APTOM] But, Commander!
I can't turn my back now,

15
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,416
after he's slaughtered my...

16
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,916
[GUYOT] <i>I said withdraw!</i>

17
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:43,833
[SHO] Damn it!

18
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,958
Dad...
Tetsuro...

19
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,583
Mizuki...

20
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:52,583
Now they're all gonna die!
This is all my fault!

21
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,291
If I had known it would
turn out like this,

22
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,666
I wouldn't have
taken it this far!

23
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,166
I should have given up!

24
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,000
After all this, is that
really how you feel?

25
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,958
Come on, Sho.

26
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,041
Stand up.

27
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:10,958
[SHO] Who are you?
How do you know my name?

28
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,458
[SHO] Masaki Murakami...

29
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,625
I used to be a freelance
journalist.

30
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:25,833
I got involved with Chronos

31
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,250
when I was covering a
story a while back.

32
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,666
Really? It sounds to me like
you're lucky to still be alive.

33
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:36,541
I know how you feel, having
your family taken hostage.

34
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:40,000
However, if they got their hands
on the Guyver units,

35
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,750
it wouldn't just be your friends
and family who would suffer.

36
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,083
I'm afraid the whole of humanity

37
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,958
would be at the
mercy of Chronos.

38
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah, but, the question is,
what am I supposed to do now?

39
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,250
I don't even have a single clue

40
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,875
where the three of them
were taken off to.

41
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:56,708
[MURAKAMI] That's easy. I think
I know where we can find them.

42
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,833
Without their Japanese Branch,
Chronos is out of options.

43
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,916
Only Mount Minakami remains.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,375
Mount Minakami?
[MURAKAMI] That's right.

45
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,833
[SHO] So you think we'll
find my friends there?

46
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,791
S'what I think.

47
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,083
[SHO] <i>Who is this guy</i>

48
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,375
<i>and why does he know so</i>
<i>much about Chronos?</i>

49
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,833
<i>I don't have much of a choice,</i>

50
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,833
<i>but I hope I can trust</i>
<i>you, Murakami.</i>

51
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,833
[threatening music building]

52
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,791
We should be there in
about an hour.

53
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,833
Try to keep an eye out for
the exit, all right?

54
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,041
So then... what happens
when we get there?

55
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,958
I mean, what's at the mountain?

56
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,625
A place called Relic's Point.

57
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:14,708
What does that mean?
What's Relic's Point?

58
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:18,083
An ancient ruin buried
inside the mountains.

59
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,583
The last Chronos base
left in Japan.

60
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,000
A hidden base?

61
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,291
[TETSURO] How did they hide
such a huge structure

62
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,750
inside the mountain?!

63
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,375
[MURAKAMI] There's a
whole ton of legends

64
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,250
surrounding this place.

65
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,166
For example,
some people say that

66
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,416
the legendary cave of "Awa
no Iwato" is hidden inside.

67
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,833
Other people believe that
it's a man-made mountain

68
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,250
constructed in ancient times.

69
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,416
Scholars claim that
the entire structure

70
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,458
is the world's largest
unfinished pyramid.

71
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,875
It was before your time,

72
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,541
but do you know of the
Takeshiro chain of earthquakes?

73
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:04,541
[SHO] Unh-uh.

74
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,166
[MURAKAMI] They
happened in 1965.

75
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,166
In the area surrounding
Mount Minakami,

76
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,708
there was a series of
apparent earthquakes.

77
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,708
The mountain itself was at the
epicenter of the quakes.

78
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,000
We can only assume that Chronos
went to investigate the area

79
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,750
and happened upon
the ancient ruins

80
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,416
lying dormant deep
within the mountain.

81
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,375
The ruins inside were
still functional

82
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,208
and now Chronos is
using them as a base.

83
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,333
This is nuts!

84
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:50,625
There's so many! Way more than
before! I don't believe it!

85
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,708
Hey, move it.

86
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,291
[TETSURO] <i>There must be</i>
<i>something really big</i>

87
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,125
<i>going down here.</i>

88
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:02,500
Murakami, what kind of things
are they doing there?

89
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,750
Mostly bioweapons research.

90
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,041
It's a huge production facility

91
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,416
supposedly built
by the Creators.

92
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,833
Most complete ruins
they left behind.

93
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,666
The whole place had gone
completely untouched for ages.

94
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,791
A living relic from
ancient times.

95
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,041
The Creators' ruins?

96
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,875
But most importantly,
it's the place

97
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,791
where the three Guyver units
were first discovered.

98
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,125
So they were uncovered when
Chronos investigated the ruins?

99
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:34,041
Then that means Relic's Point
is where it all began.

100
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,000
[SHO] <i>Dad's diary...</i>

101
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:42,833
[GUARD] Get in.

102
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,458
Hurry up! Move!

103
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,458
Steady, Sir!
[MIZUKI] Mr. Fukamachi!

104
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,166
Hey, don't be so rough!

105
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,666
[FUMIO] Why is this
happening to us?

106
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,875
It's my fault.

107
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,041
I'm the one who started
all this mess, Sir.

108
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,666
I don't understand.
Tetsuro, please...

109
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,625
Would you mind telling me what
the heck's going on here?

110
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,875
[TETSURO] Sure.

111
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,666
[FUMIO'S VOICE] It was my turn
to make breakfast this morning.

112
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,291
I ate it together with Sho.
So go the lives of us two men...

113
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,500
Things don't change much,

114
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,958
but isn't that what
happiness is all about?

115
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,375
I got up and had last
night's leftovers.

116
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,416
Sho forgot it was his
turn to make breakfast,

117
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,666
which is unusual for him.

118
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,250
He had a slight fever, so he
stayed home from school.

119
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,416
I was a little concerned.

120
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,500
I can tell there's something
he wants to talk about,

121
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,083
but I'm ashamed to admit that

122
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,375
I can't find a single word to
say to him at a time like this.

123
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,750
Sho has seemed unusually
depressed for the past few days,

124
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,125
and I'm starting to get
really worried.

125
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,583
It may be that he's just
not feeling well,

126
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,083
but I'm afraid he might
be going through

127
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:11,375
a more serious problem
that he's not telling me about.

128
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,416
I've wondered if it's
my place as his father

129
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,208
to demand some kind of answer,

130
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:19,166
but I think it's better
just to trust him.

131
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,166
I'm sure he'll open up and
talk to me some day.

132
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,083
I just have to be patient.

133
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,291
Sho's a strong boy.

134
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,000
For all of his life
he's kept all of his

135
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:33,375
sad and painful feelings
bottled up inside,

136
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,541
silently enduring them
all alone.

137
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,500
Of course, it's frustrating
for me to know this,

138
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,416
because I want to be able to
comfort him so much.

139
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,958
[SHO] <i>Dad...</i>
<i>I swear I'm gonna save you!</i>

140
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,291
[computer beeping]

141
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:07,750
[MURAKAMI] Sho, look.
It's Mount Minakami.

142
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,750
So that's it.
Now I understand.

143
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,250
Poor Sho.

144
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,708
I'm really sorry, Sir.

145
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,375
If I hadn't taken him
to the woods that day,

146
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,416
none of this would
have happened!

147
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,208
[FUMIO] No, thank you for
staying with him, Tetsuro.

148
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,541
This must have been horrible
for the both of you.

149
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:33,083
I'm the one who's sorry.
I couldn't do anything to help.

150
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,500
Don't say that!

151
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,708
There's no way you could have
known what was going on!

152
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:41,583
It's my fault too for ignoring
Sho's problems for so long.

153
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,833
That's not true. I'm
sure Sho's just happy to

154
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,208
have you guys as
friends these days.

155
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,583
[TETSURO] Thank you...

156
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:51,500
I just wish I could have
done something for him.

157
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,416
Sho's been fighting for us
all this time, hasn't he?

158
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,041
[TETSURO] Yeah.

159
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,208
[FUMIO] In any case,

160
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,250
I'm just glad the two of
you are all right.

161
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,375
Don't worry about Sho.

162
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,541
I'm sure he'll figure
something out.

163
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,625
Even though we've
all been captured

164
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,291
and locked up in
a place like this,

165
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,666
I feel like there's got to be
something I can do for Sho.

166
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,958
I am his father.

167
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,000
[car door closing]

168
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,416
They're somewhere
in that mountain.

169
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,166
And once we make it in,
we can rescue them, right?

170
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,166
I'll get them out of there.

171
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,791
We're going back together,
no matter what it takes.

172
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,333
Sir!

173
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,833
At ease, You're relieved.
Go take a break.

174
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,291
But, Sir...

175
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,916
It's all right. Go on, I'll take
care of everything here.

176
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,166
Sir!

177
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,250
Makishima?!
[TETSURO] Makishima!

178
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,166
What the hell is going on here?!

179
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,916
Makishima, explain?

180
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I didn't want all of you
to get dragged into this.

181
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:14,916
But I'm afraid I no longer have
the luxury to make that call.

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,250
That's bullshit!

183
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,291
We weren't just "dragged in",
we were kidnapped!

184
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,125
Get a grip, Segawa!
[TETSURO] How the hell

185
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,291
am I supposed to "get a grip"?

186
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,375
[MAKISHIMA] Listen!
Listen.

187
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,958
My real motive here is
the downfall of Chronos.

188
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:33,666
What? The downfall of Chronos?

189
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,250
[TETSURO] Do you really expect
me to believe that crap?!

190
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,541
Hold on. I'll prove it
to you right now.

191
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,416
Bioboost!

192
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,833
What? You're Guyver III?!

193
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,166
[MAKISHIMA] Stand back.

194
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,958
[P.A.] The Guyver has appeared
in D Block on the second level!

195
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,250
All combat-ready Zoanoids
move to D Block immediately!

196
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,500
[MAKISHIMA] They're sending in
Zoanoids. We have to hurry.

197
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,833
[Makishima attacks]

198
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:17,041
[GUYOT] I'm ready for you
this time, Guyver III.

199
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,000
[evil laughter]

200
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,375
[MAKISHIMA] This way. Hurry!

201
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,958
[MAKISHIMA] <i>It would be easier</i>
<i>for me to escape on my own,</i>

202
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,791
<i>but the problem is,</i>
<i>if I leave them here,</i>

203
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,333
<i>I won't be able to</i>
<i>manipulate the Guyver I,</i>

204
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:44,125
<i>and he may prove useful to me.</i>

205
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,041
Guyot, Sir.
I've located the targets.

206
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,333
They're on
the fourth level.

207
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,583
It appears that they've just
breached the outermost zone.

208
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,250
[GUYOT] I see. He's
trying to use Terminal 2

209
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,500
to get back to town.

210
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,416
He must take me for
a fool if he thinks

211
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,750
I'm going to let him escape
on the transport line.

212
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,958
I want you to cut all power
going to Level 4 immediately!

213
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,000
[MAKISHIMA] Wait, stay here.

214
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,000
[Zoanoids growling &amp; hissing]

215
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,250
[MAKISHIMA] Damn it!
It's just one after another.

216
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,208
[power building]

217
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,125
[sudden heartbeat]
[Sho gasps]

218
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,916
What's wrong?
[SHO] It's the Guyver III.

219
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's close. I can feel it.

220
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,166
[BARCAS] Damn it, Richard.

221
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,958
Can't you even take care
of one little boy?

222
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,083
Do you need me here
to hold your hand?

223
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,875
But then again, I guess
I'd be disappointed too

224
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:45,958
if I had to come all the
way to Japan for nothing.

225
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:49,416
Well, I guess you're up next.

226
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,083
[MAKISHIMA] Well, now at
least they won't be able

227
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,291
to pursue us for a while.

228
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,375
Unfortunately, I don't think

229
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,000
we'll be able to
use the terminal.

230
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,458
Almost. He's definitely close.

231
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,916
That's unexpected.

232
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,416
Something must be going
on at Relic's Point.

233
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,500
[TETSURO] Hey, Makishima,

234
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,375
I'm guessing we're still pretty
far underground, right?

235
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,166
What the heck are you
planning to do now?

236
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,666
[MAKISHIMA] Don't worry, Segawa.

237
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,333
Once I find the right place to
break through the ceiling,

238
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,000
we'll come out on the surface.

239
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,333
Makishima?
[MAKISHIMA] Hm?

240
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:42,375
Are you sure...
you're not taking this too far?

241
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,875
I mean, it might have
been a little rash

242
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,291
to rescue us like that.

243
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,250
[MAKISHIMA] I don't think
it's a problem.

244
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,958
I had planned to make a move
sooner or later, regardless.

245
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,958
Guyot's pretext for calling
me to Relics' Point

246
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,708
was to have me transformed
into a hyper-Zoanoid

247
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:01,166
in order to fill a role as one
of Chronos' leaders.

248
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,541
Naturally, they would have had
to examine my body first,

249
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,708
and then they would have
discovered that I was a Guyver.

250
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,083
Taking that into consideration,

251
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,416
I'd say that now is as
good a time as ever to act.

252
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,625
Hold on, I've got a question.
If you knew Sho was the Guyver,

253
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,958
why did you keep your identity
hidden from us all this time?

254
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,208
If our goals are the same,

255
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,291
it would've been better
to be on close terms,

256
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,416
in case we had to join forces,
like we're doin' now.

257
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,125
Wouldn't you think?

258
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,333
[MAKISHIMA] As you
know, I've been dealing

259
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,083
with a rather
complicated situation.

260
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,000
It was necessary to
avoid doing anything

261
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,750
that would arouse any suspicion.

262
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,250
And, knowing you were

263
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,500
under their surveillance all
this time, meeting with you

264
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,875
and talking about the
Guyver wasn't possible.

265
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,250
After all, to
deceive one's enemy,

266
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,125
you must first appear
as an ally, right?

267
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,250
I get it. But why
should I believe

268
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,750
you're giving us
the whole story?

269
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:52,541
Tetsu, stop!
[TETSURO] "Tetsu"?

270
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,708
What happened to "big brother"
or just plain old "Tetsuro"?

271
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,666
[MAKISHIMA]
Don't take another step.

272
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,125
[TETSURO] What's wrong?

273
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,416
[MAKISHIMA] Five, huh?

274
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,166
Stop sneaking around like rats
and show yourselves!

275
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,250
[ZX-TOLE] Well done, Guyver III.

276
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,666
End of the road, pardner.

277
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,708
I'm afraid this tunnel's
gonna be your tomb!

278
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,416
[MAKISHIMA]
Spare me the bravado.

279
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,833
Just hurry up and transform
so we can get this over with.

280
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,750
[Zx-Tole chuckles]
[transformation growls]

281
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,083
Zoanoids!
[Zx-Tole laughs &amp; transforms]

282
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,708
[MAKISHIMA]
You're underestimating me.

283
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,583
No matter how big you talk,

284
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:46,333
five Zoanoids aren't enough to
defeat a Guyver with my power!

285
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,375
[DERZERB] [chuckles]
Come on, is that all you've got?

286
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,500
[MAKISHIMA] What?!

287
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:03,000
Makishima!
[TETSURO] Mizuki!

288
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,041
[MAKISHIMA] Proud of your
brute strength, are you?

289
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,541
Well, in that case...

290
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:13,750
[Derzerb laughs derisively]

291
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,125
[MAKISHIMA]
He absorbed my beam?!

292
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,083
[Derzerb roars &amp; growls]

293
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,625
[MAKISHIMA]
They're all so much stronger!

294
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,000
[GASTER] Fire!

295
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,000
You're finished!

296
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,083
Makishima!

297
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,541
[MAKISHIMA] Bastard...

298
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,291
I'd like to see you
try that again!

299
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,416
[GASTER] That's it!

300
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,041
[Makishima grunts &amp; screams]

301
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,958
Makishima!

302
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,625
[MAKISHIMA] He can make his
projectiles change course?

303
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,500
[Zoanoids chuckling]

304
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,291
[THANCRUS]
Now do you understand?

305
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:13,791
Don't mistake us for
ordinary Zoanoids.

306
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,583
[MAKISHIMA] Hyper-Zoanoids...

307
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,791
[ELEGNE] We've been optimized

308
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,791
with the latest
technology available.

309
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:24,291
We outfight anything produced
at the Japanese Branch.

310
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,250
[MAKISHIMA]
A team of Zoanoid elites, huh?

311
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,875
[GUYOT] This is as far as
you go, Guyver III.

312
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:32,250
Or perhaps I should
call you Zeus?

313
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,083
[MAKISHIMA] <i>Guyot!</i>
[GUYOT] I was foolish.

314
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,875
I should have realized
who you were the moment

315
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:40,333
you uttered that name
back at the Japanese Branch.

316
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,041
[GUYOT] You bastard!
Who the hell are you?!

317
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,916
[MAKISHIMA] Why don't you
just call me Zeus?

318
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,250
Zeus, son of Chronos
in Greek mythology,

319
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,875
after hiding for many years,

320
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,583
killed his father
to exact revenge

321
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,375
and usurp his throne
as king of the gods.

322
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,458
In our case, that
means a defiant child

323
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,666
raised by our organization,

324
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,416
fueled by hatred and holding
a high enough position to plot

325
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,083
the downfall of Chronos
from the inside out.

326
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:10,541
That's none other than you!
Agito Makishima!

327
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,791
Only my closest aide
would be so familiar

328
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:13,958
with the Japanese Branch

329
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,000
to come and go as he saw fit.

330
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,875
Indeed, it's no wonder
that the Guyver III

331
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,583
would suddenly appear
wherever I went.

332
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:21,458
[MAKISHIMA]
If you knew that much,

333
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,291
then why did you summon me here?

334
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,791
Look what happened
to Relic's Point.

335
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,416
It could have ended up
like the Japanese Branch.

336
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,250
[GUYOT] I may have let you
go too far but...

337
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:35,208
[BARCAS] It's still much less
risky than letting you run wild.

338
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:39,250
[laughing] You sound surprised.

339
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,666
Allow me to introduce you
to a colleague of mine.

340
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,750
Like myself, he is one of the
twelve directors of Chronos.

341
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,166
He is also the
greatest scientist

342
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,000
that the world has ever known...

343
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,291
Dr. Hamilcar Barcas!

344
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,625
[MAKISHIMA]
Barcas?! What is he doing here?

345
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,666
Guyver though you may be,
there is still a human body

346
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,041
that constitutes the
core of your being.

347
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,750
You should know that
its supply of energy

348
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,958
is not without its limits!

349
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,916
That foolish little
rampage of yours

350
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,833
has left your body
completely exhausted!

351
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,708
[BARCAS] I myself have
optimized these hyper-Zoanoids

352
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,708
to be the best of the best!

353
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,000
You were never a match for them.

354
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,750
Not at your strongest,
and certainly not now!

355
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,041
[MAKISHIMA] Take this!

356
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,750
[BARCAS]
<i>Now, Zx-Tole, don't hold back.</i>

357
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,000
<i>Show him your true power!</i>

358
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,916
[ZX-TOLE] As you command, Sir.

359
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,458
[sounds of roof collapsing]

360
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:45,375
[ZX-TOLE] What?

361
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,708
Sho!

362
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:31,041
[NARRATOR] After the two
Guyvers endure a brutal attack

363
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,333
from the hyper-Zoanoid forces,

364
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:36,625
Sho's father once again
falls into enemy hands.

365
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,583
Struggling to find refuge,

366
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:41,958
Sho and his friends meet two of
Makishima's loyal servants.

367
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:45,125
In a quiet haven in the
woods, the tale of his past

368
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:48,125
is recounted with
bitterness and sorrow.

369
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:49,500
Longing for their dreams,

370
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:52,666
the two Guyvers depart
for battle once again.

371
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,125
Next time:
"To Each His Own Resolution"
