1
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:01,500
[SHO] All right, energy
replenishment is complete.

2
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:05,708
Activate thrusters!

3
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,958
Get ready! I'm taking
the ship to the surface!

4
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,791
[Guyot yells in surprise]

5
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,333
[Murakami lets out a battle cry]

6
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,000
[Guyot screams in pain]

7
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,500
[Guyot screams as he falls]

8
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,000
[MURAKAMI] It's over...

9
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,833
<i>This is the end, Murakami.</i>

10
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,333
<i>But it's a new</i>
<i>beginning as well.</i>

11
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:06,041
<i>I'm glad we could see this day.</i>

12
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,291
Doctor...

13
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,041
Doctor!

14
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,833
<i>Doctor Odagiri...</i>

15
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:39,250
[Murakami sobs quitely]

16
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:57,875
[APTOM] Sounds like things are
starting to get ugly down there.

17
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,500
What the hell is that thing?

18
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,958
[Aptom yells in alarm
then grunts in pain]

19
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:17,125
Is that the Creator's ship?!
There's no way!

20
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:20,083
How did they get that
thing moving again?

21
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,000
Damn it...

22
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,083
Those energy waves it's putting
out are acting like a barrier.

23
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,458
Well, I guess this is it.

24
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,250
My only choice now is
to get out of here.

25
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,250
So long, Relic's Point.
It's been fun.

26
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,333
[people fleeing in panic]

27
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,875
Commander Guyot!

28
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:54,833
H..Help me!
[strangled noise]

29
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,208
[CONTROL] Research and
development has been destroyed!

30
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,458
No response from the executive
sectors either!

31
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,166
[SOLDIER] Where's the Doctor?

32
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,833
Shouldn't we have received
orders from him by now?

33
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,583
[CONTROL]
We can't wait for orders.

34
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,250
We gotta get the hell out of
here before we're all killed!

35
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,541
[soldiers screaming]

36
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,416
The gravity disturbance has
scarcely been resolved,

37
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,458
and then all hell breaks loose!

38
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,458
[SIN] <i>I'm getting a tremendous</i>
<i>biometric response.</i>

39
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,625
<i>A massive power is rising up</i>
<i>from the ground.</i>

40
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,333
<i>No, it can't be...</i>

41
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,041
[BARCAS] The Relic has awakened.

42
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,541
After millennia of lying
in dormancy,

43
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,791
it has sprung to life once more.

44
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,166
I'm glad youre here!

45
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,541
[PURGSTALL] It's good to see
you well, Doctor Barcas.

46
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,250
 We were concerned.

47
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:50,541
Doctor, what do you mean,
the Relic has awoken?

48
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,416
It's regained the powers that

49
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,041
the Creators
wielded so long ago.

50
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,791
Soon it will take to
the heavens.

51
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,875
As it climbs higher and higher,

52
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,958
it will tear down everything
that stands in its path.

53
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,833
But... but how?!

54
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,916
Who's responsible for this?

55
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,583
I've been wondering that myself.

56
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,541
At first, I thought that
Richard might have activated it

57
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,375
when he fell to
the bottom floor,

58
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,625
but now I'm starting to think
that other things were at play.

59
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,416
Guyot?

60
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,666
[PURGSTALL] Surely not! This is
beyond Guyot's power.

61
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,333
[SIN]
True, but I can think of someone

62
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,000
who IS strong enough
to launch the Relic.

63
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,875
[CAERLEON] Archanfel!

64
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,500
Doctor Barcas, do you think
Archanfel is here as well?

65
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,625
[Archanfel struggles
and screams]

66
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,833
I encountered him shortly before
escaping Relic's Point.

67
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,708
He launched the ship!

68
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,541
[BARCAS] I wish that were so...

69
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:07,083
[SHO] Here, Murakami,
come inside with everyone else.

70
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,250
<i>Such a powerful presence...</i>

71
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,458
<i>I've never felt anything</i>
<i>like this before.</i>

72
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,041
<i>It must be a Zoalord.</i>

73
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,666
<i>No, the Council of Twelve...</i>

74
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,041
[SHO] Hey, Murakami, is
something wrong?

75
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,083
It's dangerous out there!
You gotta come inside!

76
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,333
[MURAKAMI] Right...

77
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,833
[Murakami gasps in surprise]

78
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,958
[GUYOT] Don't look so surprised!

79
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:47,041
You didn't really think you
could beat me that easily.

80
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:51,500
[MURAKAMI] Guyot?!
[Guyot laughs]

81
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,291
[MURAKAMI] Damn it, I thought
I finished him off!

82
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,666
[GUYOT] You did a good job of
disabling my right arm,

83
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:03,750
but I still have the
Guyver Remover.

84
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,625
It's all right!

85
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:09,125
I only need ONE arm to repay you
for last time, guinea pig!

86
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,875
[Murakami groans in pain]

87
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,083
Murakami!

88
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,291
[GUYOT] What's wrong, prototype?

89
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,750
Where's all that bravado?

90
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,291
How many times do I
have to tell you?

91
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:34,291
A piece of garbage like you is
no match for a true Zoalord!

92
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,416
Murakami!

93
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,291
Let him go!

94
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,208
[GUYOT] Oh, you think you can
just swallow me up, do you?

95
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,833
[MURAKAMI] Don't do it, Sho.
It's too risky.

96
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,250
You can't let him inside
the Relic,

97
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,916
not as long as he has
the Remover.

98
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:03,041
[GUYOT]
Sho? Ah, now I understand.

99
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,458
So, the Guyver I is piloting
the Relic after all.

100
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,291
Excellent!
[Murakami groans in pain]

101
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,500
[Guyot laughs as Murakami
continues to groan]

102
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,583
Stop it!

103
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,333
[GUYOT] You hear that Guyver I?

104
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,208
Your friend is dying.

105
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:29,958
You'd better move it,
or he's as good as dead!

106
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,000
[MURAKAMI] Sho, please don't
worry about me.

107
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:36,500
Either way, I...
[screams in pain]

108
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,458
NO!

109
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:42,541
[MURAKAMI] Either way, my
life cannot be saved.

110
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,708
What do you mean?!

111
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,833
[MURAKAMI] Is it still possible
for me to transform?

112
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,000
[ODAGIRI] I imagine you could
do it once more,

113
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,208
but your lifespan will
be drastically reduced

114
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,583
in the process.

115
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,458
One more time, huh?
I think that should be enough.

116
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:06,500
I appreciate it, Doctor.
[loud crash in the hallway]

117
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,291
[ODAGIRI]
I didn't know you were there.

118
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,583
[MURAKAMI] Could you keep this a
secret from everyone else?

119
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,708
[MIZUKI] But...

120
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:17,000
[MURAKAMI]
Please, especially from Sho.

121

122

<i>sacrifice yourself,</i>

123
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,708
<i>just so we could escape.</i>

124
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,500
Mizuki, did you...

125
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,750
did you already know?

126
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,291
[GUYOT]
I'm getting tired of waiting.

127
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,125
Get out here, Guyver!
He's running out of time.

128
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,791
[MURAKAMI] Don't do it!

129
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:52,916
Don't listen to him!
[screams in pain]

130
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,416
STOP IT!

[5PURGSTALL] The Relic!

00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:35,333
[SIN] After all these years,
it's risen at last.

136
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,541
[GUYOT] So, you finally decided
to come, Guyver I.

137
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,916
[MURAKAMI] Sho, why?!

138
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,791
I told you to stay inside!

139
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,875
[SHO] All right, Guyot,
keep your promise.

140
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,708
Let Murakami go.

141
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,875
[GUYOT]
Well, I suppose he's outlived

142
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,291
his usefulness to me anyway.

143
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:23,333
See if you have any use
for his corpse.

144
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,666
Night-night, guinea pig!

145
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,000

Listen, everyone,
I need your help.

153

We're going to attack the Relic.

Attack the Relic?!

155
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:16,125
But, Barcas, why?
I don't understand.

156
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,500
[BARCAS] I trust you all saw
that flash, just now?

157
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,750
That was a Guyver's
mega-smasher.

I'm afraid the Relic has fallen

00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,708
But still, this is too much!

160
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,666
The relic is the greatest legacy
of the Creators.

161
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,458
We can't...

162
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,875
And what if they manage
to escape with it?

163
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,750
What do you think will
happen then?

164
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,875
Can you even imagine what the
consequences might be

165
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,250
if they obtain the technology
hidden on that ship?

166
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,125
Yes, you're right.

167
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:47,291
[BARCAS] We must destroy it,
while we still have the chance!

168
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:55,500
[SHO] Hang in there, Murakami!
Don't die! Please!

169
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:04,750
[MURAKAMI] I'm counting on you,
Sho, and the others.

170
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,541
You're mankind's last hope.

171
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,833
It's up to you.

172
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,166
Carry on my will...

173
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,958
the will of Doctor Odagiri...

174
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:19,208
and Doctor Yamamura.

175
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,166
Listen to me, Sho.

176
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,833
Please, don't let our
sacrifices...

177
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:30,000
be all in vain.

178
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:50,208
[SHO] Murakami? [sobs]

179
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,250
Guyot...

180
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,833
[GUYOT] [laughs]
That Guyver unit is a weapon,

181
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,541
not a toy for a little
brat like you!

182
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:35,833
Now, at long last, it will
belong to a more worthy master!

183
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,750
Guyot, you'll pay for this!

184
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,208
[Guyot laughs]
[MAKISHIMA] Fukamachi!

185
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,208
[SHO] I'll make you suffer for
what you did to him!

186
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,375
[MAKISHIMA]
Fukamachi, use your mega smasher

187
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,083
before he can fire the Remover!

188
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,416
[GUYOT] I don't think so, boy!

189
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,791
[SHO] DIE, you bastard!

190
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,291
[GUYOT]
The whole Council! Dammit!

191
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,166
What's going on out there, Sho?

192
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,708
[SHO] Who's attacking us?

193
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,125
[MAKISHIMA] It must be the
Council of Zoalords.

194
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,000
[SHO] What are they doing here?

195
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,625
[GUYOT] There's no way
I can take on the Guyvers

196
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,000
<i>and</i> the Council.

197
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,583
I'm at a clear disadvantage.

198
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,791
[SHO] Guyot, get back here!

199
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,625
[MAKISHIMA] Fukamachi!

200
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,875
[Makishima screams in pain]

201
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,208
[SHO] Makishima!

202
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,750
[MAKISHIMA] Forget about me!

203
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,875
Don't let Guyot get away!

204
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,541
[GUYOT] Well, as long as
I have the Remover,

205
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,375
I'll have as many
chances as I need

206
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,166
to recover one of
the Guyver units.

207
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,916
What the hell is that?

208
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,458
[ARCHANFEL]
Not so fast, Richard.

209
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,916
Where do you think
you're going?

210
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,166
[GUYOT] But I thought you...

211
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,333
Well...
[PURGSTALL] It's Archanfel!

212
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,208
He must have come here to
take back the Relic!

213
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:56,083
[BARCAS] <i>He returned from beyond</i>
<i>the event horizon.</i>

214
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:59,000
<i>Even death bows to</i>
<i>his strength.</i>

215
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:10,000
[ARCHANFEL] I will have your
Zoacrystal back now.

216
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,333
[GUYOT] No, stop! NO!

217
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,333
[ARCHANFEL] And the Remover...

218
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,958
[Guyot gasps in sudden pain]
[Archanfel yelps in surprise]

219
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,791
[MAKISHIMA] Fukamachi, use
your smasher! Hurry!

220
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,500
[SHO] A..All right!

221
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,666
[ARCHANFEL] So, these are the
little bioboosted insects

222
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,916
that have given Chronos
so much trouble.

223
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,833
[SHO] Who the hell is he?

224
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,541
[MAKISHIMA] I don't know.
I'm just sure he's our enemy,

225
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,625
and a very dangerous
one at that.

226
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,750
[MAKISHIMA] FIRE!

227
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:15,458
SHO!

228
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,375
It's over.

229
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,041
The Relic's been destroyed.

230
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:25,916
<i>The final legacy of the</i>
<i>Creators has been put to rest,</i>

231
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,041
<i>lost in the folds of time.</i>

232
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,041
[ARCHANFEL] Another earthquake?

233
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,625
Magma...

234
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What a disaster...

235
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,583
The Remover is no more.

236
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,291
[NARRATOR]
In a world under Chronos' rule,

237
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:34,666
there is a deceptive
feeling of peace.

238
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,250
Hidden in a tiny corner of
this bizarre reality,

239
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,041
Mizuki and her friends hold
fast to the belief

240
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:44,458
that Sho has somehow survived
his last battle.

241
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:47,583
As an unbearable melancholy
creeps into their minds,

242
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:51,041
desperate hearts call out
to lost comrades.

243
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:54,791
Next time:
"In a Conquered Town"
