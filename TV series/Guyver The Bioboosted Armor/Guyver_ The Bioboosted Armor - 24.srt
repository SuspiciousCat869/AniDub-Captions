00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,250
[PARLIAMENT MEMBER]
This system of taxation,

2
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,125
is absolutely unjust!

3
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,916
There is no way that this will
approved by the public!

4
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,666
That's why I motion that this
bill be rejected immediately.

5
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,375
I would like to hear your
thoughts on the issue,

6
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:18,750
Mr. Prime Minister.

7
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,750
[PRIME MINISTER]
Well, the government's stance

8
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,833
regarding this matter is that...

9
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:26,416
That we believe the public will
in fact endorse this... [chokes]

10
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,375
[PARLIAMENT MEMBER] Mr. Prime
Minister, are you all right?

11
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,875
[Prime Minister growls
as he transforms]

12
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,041
What is this, a horror movie?

13
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,375
It just looked like a
debate a minute ago.

14
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,458
[PRESIDENT] What do you mean
"virtually annihilated"?

15
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,666
We're the strongest
nation in the world!

16
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,250
None of this makes any sense!

17
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,916
I don't even know what
we're dealing with!

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,833
Where did these
things come from?

19
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,208
Where the hell have they been
hiding all this time, Billy?!

20
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,875
Do you really want me to
tell you, Mr. President?

21
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,291
[Billy laughs as he transforms]

22
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,166
Yeah, I guess,
if you don't mind.

23
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,458
[BILLY] We have been
beside you all along.

24
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,791
For many years now, we've been
waiting for this day to come.

25
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,125
The operation was an
overwhelming success,

26
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,875
Lord Archanfel.

27
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,291
From this day forth,

28
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,500
the planet Earth will bow to the
will of Chronos!

29
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,958
[crowd cheering as music plays]

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,625
[NEWSCASTER]
Good afternoon, everyone.

31
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:00,208
Today marks the anniversary of
Chronos' rise to power.

32
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,583
One year ago on this day,

33
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:05,000
Chronos took control of every
nation in the world.

34
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,083
After becoming the first

35
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,791
all-encompassing
military organization

36
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,666
in the history of the planet,

37
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,625
Chronos implemented radical
changes

38
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,458
to all the world governments.

39
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,208
National borders were dissolved,

40
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,583
and as a result

41
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,208
international disputes were
virtually eliminated.

42
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:22,208
And thanks to the application of
Chronos' advanced technologies,

43
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,750
there have been rapid
advancements in medical science

44
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:28,416
as well as a dramatic reduction
in world-wide pollution.

45
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,458
However, Chronos has focused
most of its attention

46
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,000
on the global evolution
of the human race,

47
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,291
otherwise known as
"Zoanoid Optimization".

48
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,750
Of course, Chronos insists that

49
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,500
optimization is strictly
non-compulsory,

50
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,166
and any decision to undergo
the process

51
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,083
is up to the individual.

52
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,041
Although optimization rates are
still relatively low,

53
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,791
thanks to its numerous
advantages,

54
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,833
the numbers of those undergoing
the process

55
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,333
are rapidly increasing.

56
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,083
[chuckles] That looks heavy.
Lemme give you a hand.

57
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,500
Thanks, but no thanks.

58
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,208
C'mon, don't be like that, doll!

59
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,916
Where's your place?
Is it close to here?

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,708
You sure got a lotta
groceries there.

61
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,833
You must have a pretty
big family, huh?

62
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,750
No need to be scared,
I won't bite.

63
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,166
It just looked like you needed
help,

64
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,916
and I've got some
power to spare.

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,958
[NATSUKI]
You're a Zoanoid right?

66
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,791
Unless you're hopped up on
steroids,

67
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,583
I'd say you're
probably a Gregole.

68
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,708
Huh? How'd you know?

69
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,125
If you think you can pick
me up

70
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,625
just cause you've
been optimized,

71
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,333
you've got another think coming.

72
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,958
Well, there you go, another
week's worth of groceries.

73
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,625
[YOHEI]
Thanks for all the hard work.

74
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,625
[MIZUKI] I'm sorry, Natsuki.
I hate to be such a pain.

75
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,916
I know it must be a nuisance to
carry all those heavy groceries.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,208
[NATSUKI] Don't worry, it's
nothing!

77
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,041
You're the ones who have it bad,

78
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:59,083
being shut up in this little
apartment for a whole year.

79
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,916
If I had known it would
be this long,

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,666
I would have gotten my uncle to
rent you guys a nicer place.

81
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,791
At the time, we just wanted
to find a good hiding spot.

82
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,416
Hey, if you hadn't given us a
place to stay,

83
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,958
I don't think we would have
lasted very long.

84
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,416
She's right, you know.

85
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,916
We were lucky to survive the
attack at Mount Minakami,

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,250
but we'd be as good as dead
if Chronos found us now.

87
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,916
These days, safety has to take
priority over comfort.

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,208
Especially since Master Agito
and Sho are gone.

89
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,958
Gone? Don't make it sound like
they're dead or something.

90
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,708
They're both still alive.

91
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,208
If we believe that, we
can keep fighting.

92
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,875
Tetsuro...

93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Oh, Mizuki, I went by
your house,

94
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,375
and it looks like
your parents aren't

95
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,875
under
surveillance anymore.

96
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,083
Huh? For real?

97
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,125
Since you haven't been
seen in so long,

98
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,583
I guess Chronos finally decided

99
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,541
that you died back
at Mount Minakami.

100
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,791
Well, that's one good thing that
came from all this mess, right?

101
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,916
But wait, that means...

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,625
our parents probably think
we're dead too.

103
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:07,208
Yeah, I'm sure Chronos
made up some story.

104
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,791
I see...

105
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,750
[TETSURO] It's better that way.

106
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,583
If everyone thinks we're dead,

107
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,208
then that means they won't have
a reason to pester Mom and Dad.

108
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,291
But if they aren't under
surveillance anymore,

109
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,875
then why couldn't we could
sneak over

110
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,625
and let them know that
we're still alive!

111
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,208
You know how Mom is, she's
probably going out of her mind,

112
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,041
thinking that we're both dead!

113
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,625
Forget it!

114
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,416
Have you already forgotten what
happened to Sho's dad?

115
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,083
If we mess up and blow our
cover at a time like this,

116
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,250
then this whole year will
have been for nothing!

117
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,208
Now, hold on a second, Tetsuro.

118
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:43,125
How dare you talk to your
sister like that?

119
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,333
You think you're all grown up

120
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,583
just cause you have that
nasty stubble?

121
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:50,208
You don't understand, Natsuki.
Chronos is too powerful.

122
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:53,416
Just looking online, you can
see how bad it's gotten.

123
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,083
It's not just that they've
taken over the world,

124
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:59,041
it's that they're starting to
change the way people think.

125
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,875
It makes me sick knowing
that more people are

126
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,500
going in for Zoanoid
optimizations every day.

127
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,500
[NATSUKI]
Yeah, but only complete morons!

128
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,875
That may be true,

129
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,750
but there's a lot of stupid
people in this world.

130
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,333
Anyway, the point is, until Sho
and Makishima come back,

131
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,375
all we can do is sit
tight and wait.

132
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,291
You can't boss everyone around.
I know you're upset,

133
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,250
but consider Mizuki too.

134
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:21,041
I think all this mess is
starting to get to your head.

135
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,083
[NATSUKI] Tetsuro?!

136
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,958
[MIZUKI] Natsuki...

137
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,958
I'm leaving.

138
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,916
Please, don't be mad.

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,125
[NATSUKI] It's all right. Next
time,

140
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,541
I'm only bringing food that
Tetsuro hates.

141
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,000
We really appreciate this,
you know.

142
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,583
Don't worry, we'll see Mom and
Dad again,

143
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,750
just wait a little longer.

144
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,625
Sho and Makishima will
be back soon.

145
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,875
Right...

146
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,875
<i>But it's been a year already.</i>

147
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,750
<i>Is Sho really...</i>

148
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,916
[TETSURO] Mizuki, be careful.

149
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,666
Sorry.

150
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:40,208
<i>Shizu's always so calm</i>
<i>and composed.</i>

151
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,250
<i>I bet the thought of Makishima</i>
<i>being dead</i>

152
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,333
<i>never even crossed her mind.</i>

153
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,625

155

00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,583
<i>If I was stuck like that, I'd</i>
<i>probably go crazy too.</i>

158
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,875
Fukamachi, if you are still
alive, come back soon.

159
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,958
That helicopter must be for
the Zoalords.

160
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,708
They've been keeping
busy these days.

161
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,500
[PURGSTALL] Good to see you!

162
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,250
[SIN] I suppose it's been
a while, hasn't it, Purgstall?

163
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,458
Well, we've been so busy
after the Relic crashed.

164
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,083
[SIN] You seem to be taking
good care of Japan.

165
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,500
[PURGSTALL] Thank you. But what
about you?

166
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,458
How are things in the Dead Sea?

167
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,458
Actually, I came here to talk to
Dr. Barcus about that.

168
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,541
Do you know where
he is right now?

169
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,750
[SIN] I feel like I haven't seen
you in ages, Dr. Barcas.

170
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,083
Well, Sin, hello.

171
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,666
[SIN] It's sudden, but I need
you to come out to the Dead Sea

172
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,916
as soon as possible.

173
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,500
[BARCAS] Yes, I know,

174
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:23,791
but I'm afraid I'll have to keep
you waiting just a bit longer.

175
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,750
I understand that
you're busy, Doctor,

176
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,083
but I'm sure you're well aware

177
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,333
of the importance
of this project.

178
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,083
The chemical components in the
Dead Sea

179
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,625
have already mutated into
their second phase.

180
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:34,791
In a short while,

181
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,416
all the necessary conditions
will be met

182
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,666
and we can begin the
process in full.

183
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,708
In the history of Chronos,

184
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:41,916
we have never conducted an
optimization

185
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,083
even close to this magnitude.

186
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,208
Doctor, we can't do this without
your assistance.

187
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:51,750
I'm sorry, Sin, but I can't
afford to leave right now.

188
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,083
I have my own project to finish.

189
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,916
What is that?

190
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,041
[BARCAS] Just a little longer
and you can see for yourself.

191
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,791
Yohei, could you keep it down?

192
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,291
You're driving me crazy with
all that banging!

193
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:57,208
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
bother you, Tetsuro.

194
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,375
Tetsuro, that's no way
to talk to Yohei!

195
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,208
He's just trying to help us
out, you know.

196
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,416
You don't have to be so rude!

197
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,791
[TETSURO] I need to concentrate,
all right?!

198
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,375
I don't see what the big deal
is,

199
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,208
you can always mess around
on the computer later!

200
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,333
You think I'm just messing
around, huh?!

201
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,583
[YOHEI] It's all right,
I'm not in any hurry.

202
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,750
I'll just finish later.

203
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,291
You need to learn to stand
up for yourself

204
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,708
once in a while, Yohei.

205
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,250
Tetsuro isn't your boss!

206
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,250
You don't have to put up with
him treating you like that!

207
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,083
Well, yes, I suppose
you're right.

208
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,083
[MIZUKI]
<i>I can't take this anymore.</i>

209
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,750
[SHIZU] It's finally done!

210
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,791
I'm sure Agito will love it!

211
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,166
Shizu!

212
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:09,083
All this time, I never
knew you were...

213
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,916
Where's Master Agito?

214
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,916
Shizu, you know he's
been missing.

215
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,791
Master Agito...
Master Agito, he...

216
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,500
Shizu!

217
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,208
Agito, no!

218
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,791
No!

219
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,041
Come on, get a hold of yourself!

220
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,583
[TETSURO] It's all right,
just calm down!

221
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,750
[SHIZU] No! No, it's...

222
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,500
[TETSURO] Don't worry, Shizu,
Makishima's still alive!

223
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,041
He's coming back, I promise!

224
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:50,291
Tetsuro, stop it! Please, just
stop. There's no more hope!

225
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,708
Do you really believe they
survived that explosion?

226
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,791
Is that what you think?!

227
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,916
Do you really believe that
they're coming back?!

228
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,875
After all this time?!

229
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,291
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have said that, should I?

230
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,208
Tetsuro...

231
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,958
I'm sorry, but I think
he's right.

232
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,208
Mizuki, you can't give up after
all we've been through.

233
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,708
If we don't believe in Sho,
then who will?

234
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,750
But it's been a whole year.

235
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:28,000
A whole year's gone by and we
haven't heard a thing.

236
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,833
Just believe.

237
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,375
That's not fair, Tetsuro.

238
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,041
You can't say that when
don't believe it yourself!

239
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,125
It's over! Sho is dead
now, all right?!

240
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,791
[TETSURO] Stop it!

241
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,791
[glass breaking]

242
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,833
Mizuki!

243
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,375
Mizuki, what the...

244
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,875
Mizuki, wait!

245
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,875
[NATSUKI] What's going on?

246
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,250
<i>It's all over.</i>
<i>Sho's not coming back.</i>

247
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,000
<i>I'll never see him again!</i>

248
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,375
[MIZUKI]
That's not fair, Tetsuro.

249
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,333
You can't say that when don't
believe it yourself!

250
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,333
[TETSURO]
<i>Is this what we are now?</i>

251
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:41,875
<i>After only a year, we've</i>
<i>gotten this weak?</i>

252
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,791
Mizuki...

253
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,250
[NATSUKI] <i>Where did she go?</i>

254
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,750
<i>What's gonna happen if the</i>
<i>Regulation Bureau finds her?</i>

255
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,541
[MIZUKI] <i>Wait, this is...</i>
<i>How did I end up here?</i>

256
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,291
<i>My house!</i>

257
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,666
But what do I do now?

258
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,750
I wanna go home.

259
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,375
I miss my parents.

260
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,583
I want to see them!

261
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,166
I want to let them know
that I'm all right!

262
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,083
Good luck charms...

263
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,500
[CAMPBELL] You there!

264
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,958
What are you doing, standing
out here in the rain?

265
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:13,500
Oh, uh, nothing.

266
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:14,583
[OFFICER] Shouldn't you have an
umbrella?

267
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,666
Are you a high school student?

268
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,333
[MIZUKI] Yes, Sir.
I mean, I, uh...

269
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,375
[CAMPBELL]
Do you live around here?

270
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,000
[OFFICER] Are you a runaway?

271
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,833
No, Sir, I was just...

272
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:28,375
Hold on, haven't I seen
you somewhere?

273
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:29,916
[NATSUKI] There you are!

274
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,875
I had a feeling I'd
find you here.

275
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,375
So, are you a friend of hers?

276
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,250
[NATSUKI] She's my sister.

277
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,958
Ever since her boyfriend
broke up with her,

278
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,916
she's been coming by his house
and staring like an idiot.

279
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,375
[NATSUKI] Give it up already,
Michiko! We're going home!

280
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,666
[MIZUKI] Yeah, all right, Sis.

281
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,166
Sorry to trouble you, Officers.

282
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,625
Wonder what the hell
all that was about?

283
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,916
What's with that face,
is something wrong?

284
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,291
Not really, but I
can't stop thinking

285
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,666
I've seen that girl
somewhere before.

286
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,666
You know that brother and sister
on the most wanted list?

287
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,375
I think that was the sister!

288
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,333
Are you sure? But they were
pronounced dead

289
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,416
because they've been missing
for over a year. Right?

290
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,916
[CAMPBELL] Well, she
didn t look dead to me!

291
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,708
If we catch them, we could
get a big promotion!

292
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,500
You chase after them, I'll
contact the Regulation Bureau!

293
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,541
Uh, right!

294
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,916
[CAMPBELL] Bureau, this is
Campbell. We've caught sight...

295
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,083
[Campbell cries out]

296
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,916
What are you doing to him?

297
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,333
Who the hell do you
think you are?!

298
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,708
Let go of him, right now!

299
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,958
You son of a bitch!

300
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:50,583
[NATSUKI] Did you see the little
charms they put out?

301
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:51,791
I noticed them earlier today

302
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,500
when I went by to
check your house.

303
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,416
I talked to your mom, and she
told me the whole story.

304
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,625
She said you and Tetsuro used
to make ones like that

305
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,791
when she and your dad left
on business.

306
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,666
I guess they kept you company
while they were gone, huh?

307
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,708
It was like they had mini
versions of themselves

308
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,083
to watch out for you.

309
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,291
Now they have a mini-Tetsuro
and Mizuki.

310
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,708
Your mom said she made
them herself.

311
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,166
Are those...

312
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,958
I asked your mom if she could
make me a couple too.

313
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:27,083
When I found out about these,
I wanted you guys to see them.

314
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:37,291
Your parents still believe you
and Tetsuro are alive.

315
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,916
They're waiting for you two to
come home,

316
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,166
just like you guys used
to wait for them.

317
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,166
[Mizuki weeps softly]

318
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,750
Oh, I see, so they
still believe, huh?

319
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,875
I think I'm ready to believe
again too.

320
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,125
Sho's still alive, and
he's coming back.

321
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:38,166
I think so too.
[Yohei agrees]

322
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,583
Agito...

323
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:55,250
[MIZUKI] <i>Sho, I'm waiting.</i>
<i>Come back soon.</i>

324
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,791
[NARRATOR]
A mysterious chrysalis

325
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,708
lies within the Dead Sea.

326
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,458
What is its power, and
why is the Resistance

327
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:39,500
fighting so desperately
to obtain it?

328
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,083
Meanwhile, Barcas sends
a new creation

329
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,500
to do battle with
an old adversary.

330
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,958
As two Lost Numbers battle in
the moonlight,

331
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:51,458
Mizuki rushes to the city
in search of Sho.

332
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:54,875
Next time:
"Quickening of the Chrysalis"
