2
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:03,583
[SYNEVITE] I-Impossible!
How could he...

3
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,875
[RISKER]
That power is completely wasted

4
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,583
on someone like you.

5
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:19,500
You can barely even defeat
a pathetic little Zoanoid.

6
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,333
[TETSURO] Oh no, not
another one.

7
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:25,291
I am Risker, an inspector from
Chronos, however...

8
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,875
I'm also... Adapt!

9
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:28,833
[Tetsuro shocked]

10
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,791
[SHO] Great...

11
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:35,500
[RISKER] ...a Guyver, like you.

12
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,791
No, it can't be...

13
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,250
What the... There's a second,
Guyver suit?

14
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,833
[RISKER] Don't look so
surprised, Sho.

15
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,500
[RISKER] The Guyver
unit that you control

16
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:59,083
is actually just one of three.

17
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,000
[SHO] Three?
[RISKER] The units

18
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,541
organically fuse
with sentient beings,

19
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:07,541
resulting in a dramatic increase
in biological functionality.

20
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,083
This life form has been fitted
with a control metal

21
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,416
that keeps its power
amplification in check

22
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,541
and prevents it from
losing control.

23
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,958
The result is a bioboosting
armor system

24
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:20,500
that can be engaged and
disengaged at will.

25
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:24,833
That is the power of the Guyver.
[SHO] I don't understand!

26
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:29,375
[RISKER] Hmph! Seems that
biology isn't your best subject.

27
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,500
[SHO] What do you people want?

28
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,916
[RISKER]
You'll find out soon enough.

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,333
Or right away, if
you come with me.

30
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,916
I'll warn you that resistance
is futile.

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,583
You can't defeat me
at your level.

32
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,083
Now, just come along quietly

33
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:47,208
and we'll return to Chronos
Headquarters together.

34
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,625
Listen, he's just trying
to intimidate you.

35
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:50,958
You're just as strong as he is.

36
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,375
Don't give up without
a fight, Sho!

37
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:56,958
[RISKER] Ah, that's right. I
still need to take care of YOU.

38
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,000
[Sho gasps]

39
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,291
Sho!

40
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:04,166
[SHO] I won't let... you
push us around... anymore!

41
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,625
[RISKER]
Then I won't go easy on you.

42
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:10,541
Now... let the lesson begin!

43
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,208
[SHO] Come and get me!

44
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,625
Sho!

45
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,916
[RISKER] This powerful infrared
laser utilizes excess body heat.

46
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,875
We call it the head beam.

47
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,125
These blades vibrate at an
ultra-high frequency,

48
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,791
allowing them to cut through
almost anything.

49
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,583
Gyah!

50
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,541
[Sho grunts in pain]

51
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,166
[RISKER] It appears that
you're not accustomed

52
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,833
to using them yet.

53
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,250
[SHO] Damn it!

54
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,958
[RISKER] You've failed
the lesson.

55
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,416
[SHO] No!

56
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,125
[massive explosion]

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,500
Not good!

58
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,083
I don't know which one fired.

59
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,791
If the two units are
essentially the same,

60
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,458
any variation
in power would be

61
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,875
due to differences
between the hosts.

62
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,083
If that guy's gone through
serious combat training,

63
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,041
this could be bad.

64
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,250
Sho! Please be all right!

65
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,500
Oh no!

66
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,458
[RISKER]
That was the mega smasher,

67
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,875
the Guyver's most
powerful weapon.

68
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,458
Its one drawback is that
there is a slight delay

69
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:37,833
before it can fire.

70
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,208
You understand now, don't you?

71
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,958
If you want to be the
heavyweight champion,

72
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:46,583
you don't just put on the gloves
and expect to win.

73
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,833
So there you have it.

74
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,125
If possible, we'd like
to bring you back alive.

75
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:53,375
After all, you're a valuable
test subject.

76
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:58,541
[SHO] I won't... let you...
push me around!

77
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,625
[RISKER] You still
don't get it, do you?

78
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,208
If you insist on
resisting me, I'll...

Come on! Let's go! This might be
our only chance, Sho!

84
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,083
We gotta get out of here!

[Sho mutters in agreement]

86

[RISKER] What was that?

87
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,708
He escaped?

88

[medical imaging sounds]

91
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,250
[DOCTOR] Brainwaves are nominal.

92
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,125
I didn't detect any
abnormalities in your DNA

93
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,583
and your immune functions
are also in good shape.

94
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,416
-That's good.

95
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,458
[DOCTOR] I don't have
any data to support this,

96
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,791
but if I had to guess...

97
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,000
I'd say this was a
temporary reaction

98
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,000
from your immune system.

99
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,666
It probably hasn't fully adapted

100
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,000
to your internal
bioboosting system yet.

101
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:19,916
I see. Well, I figured it wasn't
anything too serious.

102
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,250
[SHO] Oh really? You're
working late too?

103
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:29,291
Yeah... actually, Tetsuro needed
my help with something.

104
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,500
He's editing the Sci-Fi Club's
newsletter

105
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,125
and it's coming
down to the wire.

106
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,958
He wants me to help him get
some materials together.

107
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:39,791
Yeah... yeah...
See you later, Dad.

108
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,916
I don't like having to
lie like that.

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,750
I think it's best for us to
stay together

110
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,958
as much as possible right now.

111
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,875
I mean, now that those Chronos
guys

112
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,166
know that you're the Guyver,

113
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,875
splitting up could be pretty
dangerous

114
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,375
for both of us, ya know?

115
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,625
[TETSURO] What's wrong?
-Well, it's just...

116
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:02,583
What do you think about...
that... other Guyver out there?

117
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,208
Oh, yeah. Well, he did say

118
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,750
there were three units
altogether, didn t he?

119
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,541
So that means... There's got to
be another Guyver

120
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,541
out there somewhere doesn't it?

121
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,500
Not that...

122
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:12,875
Huh?

123
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:16,125
What do you think... was wrong
with the one we met?

124
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,375

00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:27,208
Yeah, I dunno. That was weird.

127
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,208
He was really freaking
out, wasn't he?

128
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,708
[MIZUKI] Tetsuro!
Dinner's ready!

129
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,833
I say you shouldn't dwell
on it too much, okay?

130
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,791
C'mon, let's chow down.

131
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,958

Thanks for the grub, sis!

133
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,916
Yeah, thanks a lot!

Thank you!

00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,958
Hey! Where you going?

137
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,500
I'm gonna eat in my room.

00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,125
You two have fun by
yourselves, okay?

Hey, but why don't you want to
eat together here with us?

140
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,916
Back when we were kids we used
to take baths together

141
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,750
and sleep together
and everything.

Sick-o.

That... DID sound...
kinda dirty, Tetsuro.

Really?!

[SHO] Hey, uh... I was
kinda worried that...

149
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,791
my being here might put Mizuki
in danger too, you know?

150
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:43,416
What are you talking about? It's
exactly the opposite, Sho.

151
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,666
If Mizuki was in trouble, you're
the only one who could save her!

152
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,458
I... I guess so.

[Mizuki screams]

154
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:50,666

00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,041
[MIZUKI] GET OUTTA HERE!

163
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,916
Uh, right!

164
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,375
And shut the door!

165
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,416
[SHO] Right!

166
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,625
[sighs heavily]

167
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,916
We've been expecting
you, Sir. Welcome.

168
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,750
[GENZO] B-But, Sir!

169
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,583
The Japanese Branch
is doing everything

170
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,750
in its power to recover
the units

171
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,750
as quickly as possible!

172
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,666
[GUYOT] Indeed. And I've come
here

173
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,083
to help solve that
problem personally.

174
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:20,250
As of today, I,
Commander-in-Chief

175
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,958
Richard Guyot, am assuming
complete control.

176
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,333
[GENZO] But, Sir! W-We have a
large number of Zoanoids

177
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,916
that are ready to be dispatched.

178
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,666
T-Take a look at these!

179
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,875
[GUYOT] You needn't remind
me, Makishima.

180
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,916
I am well aware of the
advancements that the

181
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,625
Japanese Branch has made
in Zoanoid development.

182
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,041
However... Zerbebuth!

183
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,291
Yes, Sir.

184
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,958
[transformation roar]

185
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,041
Dear God...

186
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,166
[GUYOT] His physical strength is
three times that of Gregole,

187
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,333
and his laser cannon is

188
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,958
eight times more powerful
than Vamore's.

189
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,583
His powers are far greater

190
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,750
than those of any Zoanoid
developed thus far.

191
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:03,958
A... a
hyper-Zoanoid? It can't be.

192
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,541
[GUYOT] Now do you understand?

193
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,666
All the achievements of the
Japanese Branch

194
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,083
have been for naught.

195
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,750
[GENZO] How could this happen?

196
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,416
[GUYOT] I will decide
your fate later.

197
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:22,125
[RISKER] This way, please.
[GUYOT] So Inspector Risker...

198
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,791
How does it feel to command

199
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:27,125
the power of Chronos' top
secret Guyver unit?

200
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,416
Oh... uh...

201
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,833
Risker, I'm surprised you'd
do something so careless.

202
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,333
[GUYOT] You know each other?

203
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,041
Yes, Sir. He and I went through
combat training together.

204
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,958
Oh.

205
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:43,750
Zerbebuth, I need you to take
care of something immediately.

206
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,875
Sir! Whatever you wish.

207
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,500
[School bell chimes]

208
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,166
[SHO] Coming to
school like this...

209
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,791
makes me feel like
nothing's really changed.

210
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah, so nothing else happened
after the fight yesterday, huh?

211
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,458
[SHO] Nope.

212
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,916
Don't worry.

213
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,083
We should be all right as
long as we're out in public.

214
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,083
I doubt they'd pull anything
crazy

215
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,458
with so many people around.

216
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,291
I hope that you're right.

217
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:22,416
Anyway, I don't wanna be late.
Sho, you're coming too.

218
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,083
Huh? To what?

219
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,458
To the Sci-Fi Club's monthly
movie showing, of course!

220
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,708
They're even letting us have
it in the A/V room today.

221
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,458
Huh? At a time like this?

222
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,375
[TETSURO] I'm doing it BECAUSE
it's a time like this.

223
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,166
We need a good sci-fi movie
now more than ever!

224
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,250
[ominous music building]

225
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,375
[COMPUTER OPERATOR] Sir... This
is all the data Inspector Risker

226
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,625
obtained during his encounter
with the other Guyver unit.

227
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,958
[RISKER] Not to be presumptuous,
Commander, but...

228
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,791
[GUYOT] Speak.

229
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,458
[RISKER] Shouldn't Zerbebuth
have been shown this data

230
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,041
before being dispatched
on his mission?

231
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,958
[GUYOT] That...
wasn't necessary.

232
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,500
[MAKISHIMA] Wait.

233
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,416
What's wrong?

234
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,750
Nothing. Headphones, huh?

[hypnotic music playing
over loudspeakers]

236
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,625
Did you see the news last night?

237
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,916
Yeah, I sure did!

238
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,625

[chuckles confidently]

242
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,791
I guess Natsuki and the others
aren't coming, huh?

243
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,750
Come on! This has got to be one

244
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,125
of the greatest sci-fi
movies ever made!

245
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,916
Doesn't this club mean anything
to those ungrateful jerks?

246

[music has stopped,
all is quiet]

247

Hey everyone!

We're here to return the key to
the A/V... room...

249
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,458
[TETSURO] Uhm, hello?

250
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,708
[SHO] Why isn't anyone here?

251
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,875
[TETSURO] They couldn't have
been abducted or anything.

252
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,250
Where the heck did everyone
disappear to?

253
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,583
Hold on, let's see....

254
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,208
No good. Mizuki isn't picking
up her phone either.

255
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,625
Huh?

00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,958

No, it can't be...

school after all, Boss.

They came... to our
high school?!

00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,000
[SHO] Watch out!

268
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,791
What is that?

269
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:46,916
[SHO] A Zoanoid!

270
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,541
[TETSURO] That one
looks different.

271
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:52,833
So that's a hyper-Zoanoid.
Let's see what it can do.

272
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,041
[ZERBEBUTH] Hmph! I don't know
how

273
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,416
you withstood the hypnotic
sound waves,

274
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,250
but you were foolish to reveal
yourself! Let's go, Guyver!

275
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,041
[SHO] My punch has no effect!

276

Zerbebuth, you've found the
Guyver, haven't you?

It had no effect?

scratch me

beam like that!

tougher

than the other
Zoanoids we ve seen.

believe the Japanese Branch

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,541
Zoanoids were defeated
by a weakling like you!

I have to find... some way to
pierce his defenses

321
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:55,166
[ZERBEBUTH] Your feeble powers
have no effect on me!

322
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,166
[SHO] Huh? A new power...

323
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,750
[ZERBEBUTH] What?!

324
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,208
Take this!

325
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,416
[screams in pain]

326
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,208
Oh man, what was that?

327
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,166
He fired off some kind of black
hole or something!

328
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,291
[ZERBEBUTH] You little punk!

329
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:25,916
[GUYOT] <i>It's over, Zerbebuth.</i>
[ZERBEBUTH] Excellency!

330
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,958
<i>[GUYOT] That was a</i>
<i>gravity-control attack just now.</i>

331
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,083
<i>It seems you've...</i>
<i>underestimated this Guyver.</i>

332
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,083
[ZERBEBUTH] I beg your
forgiveness, Sir.

333
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,041
[GUYOT] <i>Return to headquarters</i>
<i>at once!</i>

334
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,375
<i>I can t afford to lose you now.</i>

335
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,500
[ZERBEBUTH] Sir!

336
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,500
[panicky screams]

337
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,791
[SHO] Tetsuro!

338
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,083
[TETSURO] Mr. Tanaka...
[sobbing] Mr. Tanaka...

339
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:11,041
[SHO] Our first
innocent victim...

340
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:14,208
[GUYOT] <i>Perhaps the Guyver has</i>
<i>even greater powers</i>

341
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,375
<i>than we had anticipated.</i>

342
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,833
<i>It seems that the units may</i>
<i>have a number of abilities</i>

343
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,541
<i>yet to be discovered.</i>

344
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,166
[TETSURO] Mizuki! Mizuki!

345
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,833
Oh, welcome home.
Why are you so late?

346
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,208
Mizuki?!

347
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,958
But when did you get
back from school?

348
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:40,541
Well, I... must have been
pretty out of it today.

349
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,875
It's like I came home without
even knowing it. Weird, huh?

350
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:48,250
[TETSURO] Mizuki! Thank God!
I was so worried!

351
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,791
[MIZUKI] Why are you jumping
all over me all of a sudden?

352
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,875
[TETSURO] Oh, I'm so glad
you're okay!

353
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,333
[MIZUKI] Hm?

354
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,666
[SHO] <i>Not even our school</i>
<i>is safe anymore...</i>

355
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,666
[NARRATOR] A man's spirit
is crushed...

356
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,250
another's
feelings go unnoticed.

357
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,833
A mysterious shadow looms over
them both

358
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,333
and laughs silently to himself.

359
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,791
A sound reverberates...
another vanishes.

360
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,250
Sho and Tetsuro are thrown into

361
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:47,416
a twisted reality
devoid of sound.

362
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:52,333
When two powerful forces clash,
the last of the Guyvers appears.

363
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:55,541
What lies hidden within
that dark shell?

364
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,958
Next: "The Third Shadow"
