1
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,125
[SHO] How much farther
do we have to go?

2
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,916
[MAKISHIMA] The Block 2 elevator
is right around the corner.

3
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,166
That's the last one.

4
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,416
[MAKISHIMA] Getting tired?
[SHO] No, not really.

5
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,125
I was just wondering if there
was a reason why we're

6
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,583
changing elevators
every other floor.

7
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,833
[MAKISHIMA] There are too
many security checks

8
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,791
on the main elevator.

9
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,666
We're less likely to
get caught this way.

10
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,125
[SHO] You know, it wouldn't
exactly hurt

11
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,333
if you would help
me push the cart.

12
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,416
[MIZUKI] I'm sorry, Sho.

13
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,833
I mean, I guess I am
kinda heavy.

14
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,166
[SHO] No, not at all!

15
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,458
Uh, anyway, are you getting
enough air in there?

16
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:36,500
Yeah, I'm fine. Just a
little hot, that's all.

17
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,583
[SHO] Hang in there. Just a
little bit longer

18
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,333
and we'll get to
see Tetsuro again.

19
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,166
[MAKISHIMA] Sorry, but could you
please refrain from talking?

20
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,708
Remember, we're in enemy
territory here.

21
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,500
[SHO] Sorry about that!

22
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,250
[MAKISHIMA] Just keep your wits
about you. We're almost there.

23
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,166
[MIZUKI] <i>Makishima...</i>

24
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,666
[SHO] What are we doing here?
Where are we going?

25
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,708
 Makishima, what's going on?!

26
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,833
This isn't the way to
Mount Minakami!

27
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,833
[MAKISHIMA] Unequip
your armor, Sho.

28
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,541
[SHO] But...

29
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,916
Sho?
[SHO] Oh, right.

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,250
We wouldn't be able to make it
through the secret passage

31
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,666
with our Guyver suits.

32
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,458
[SHO] Secret passage?

33
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,625
[MIZUKI] What is this?
An old well?

34
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,041
[SHO] Looks tight.

35
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,250
I guess we'll have to squeeze
through one at a time.

36
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,458
[MAKISHIMA] I'll stay here and
hold the ladder in place.

37
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,041
Segawa, you go down ahead
of Fukamachi.

38
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,166
What is it?

39
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,708
[SHO] Well, you've taken this
passage before, right?

40
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,500
[MAKISHIMA] Yeah, why?

41
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,833
[SHO] Then would you
mind going first?

42
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,333
It's pretty
dark down there,

43
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,666
so if Mizuki loses her footing,

44
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,750
I'm afraid she might fall
and hurt herself.

45
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,458
All right, just follow me.

46
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:26,791
So, uh... so everyone's
really okay, right?

47
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,375
They're fine.

48
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,916
Actually, I'd say your brother's
even more energetic than usual.

49
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,750
[SHO] All right, hold on.
I'll go next.

50
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,083
[MIZUKI] That's fine,

51
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,958
but I better not catch you
looking up, all right?

52
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,750
[SHO] Right...

53
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:41,666
[MAKISHIMA] Would you
stop chatting

54
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,208
and start climbing, please?

55
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,000
[MAKISHIMA] Be careful, Segawa.

56
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,500
We'll probably be stopped

57
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,375
by two inspectors at the
next checkpoint.

58
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,250
Try not to make any noise.
[MIZUKI] Got it.

59
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,458
[SHO] Hold on just a
little longer.

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,666
[OFFICER] What are you
two here for?

61
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,333
[MAKISHIMA] We're delivering
lab materials.

62
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,333
[OFFICER] I haven't been
informed of this.

63
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,125
[SHO] Hey, there's a camera.

64
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,166
[MAKISHIMA] Just leave
this to me.

65
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,125
Here's our authorization form.

66
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,416
We've been instructed to deliver
radioactive markers

67
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,625
for testing in the lab.

68
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,666
They're conducting a
search upstairs,

69
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,375
so even the regular service
personnel

70
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,583
are stuck doing deliveries.
[RAZELL] Hey, kid,

71
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,541
what type are you?

72
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,958
You got a pretty small build,

73
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,666
so I was wondering what
type you were.

74
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,875
Ramotith? Or Gregole?

75
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,750
[SHO] Uh, I'm a Ramotith.

76
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,000
[OFFICER] Doesn't seem like this
should be a problem.

77
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,250
[MAKISHIMA] Then we'll
be on our way.

78
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,833
[RAZELL] Did you hear
that?!

79
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,458
This little shrimp is tellin'
me he's a power-type Ramotith!

80
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,583
What's up with that?!
I'm twice his size,

81
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,208
I'm a frikkin' Razell!

82
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,583
[SHO] Be careful, all right?

83
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,666
There's some really important
stuff in there, pal!

84
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,833
[RAZELL] Open it up.

85
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:14,250
Come on, we gotta verify the
contents of all containers

86
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,416
going through
the checkpoint.

87
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,291
It's required because we're
on Alert Level 5.

88
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,416
[MAKISHIMA] That's no good.

89
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,833
There's radioactive
material in there.

90
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,041
It's not safe to
open it out here.

91
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,875
[OFFICER]
Don't give me that crap.

92
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,208
I'm sick of people dragging
junk through here.

93
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,208
Just the other day, those idiots
downstairs

94
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,666
were bringing in an
optimization tank.

95
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,833
Whatever you've got in there

96
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,916
we need to report to
the guys upstairs.

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,333
[phone beeps]

98
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,041
[RAZELL] If you're trying
to hide something from us,

99
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,000
then you'd better speak up
before it's too late.

100
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:48,291
Come on, what's the deal? You
hiding a woman in there or what?

101
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,958
[OFFICER] Yes, but... Yes, Sir.

102
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,041
 Hey, guys, you can go.

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,250
[RAZELL] Wait, what's going on?

104
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,375
[OFFICER] Well, the guys
downstairs got all pissed off

105
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,833
because they thought we were
gonna contaminate the facility.

106
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,041
[RAZELL] Goddamnit!

107
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,208
Are they monitoring this
place or something?

108
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,875
You wanna come down here and
tell me what to do?!

109
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,708
[OFFICER] They left a message
for you too.

110
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,458
[RAZELL] Whaddya mean?

111
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,500
[OFFICER] They said if you're
not happy being a Razell,

112
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,333
they'll put in a request to have
you reoptimized by Dr. Barcas.

113
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,750
That sound good?

114
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,875
[RAZELL] What, you kidding me?
He'd tear me to shreds!

115
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,250
[SHO] Phew...

116
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,958
[MAKISHIMA] Looks like you're
sweating, Fukamachi.

117
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,291
[SHO] That was a close call,
can you blame me?

118
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,291
 Besides, you're sweating
as much as I am!

119
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,583
[ODAGIRI] [chuckles]

120
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,166
I never thought I'd see you
so nervous, Agito.

121
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,500
[MAKISHIMA] Thanks a lot
for the help, Odagiri.

122
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,000
If you were watching us that
whole time,

123
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,625
you could have said something
a little sooner.

124
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,250
[SHO] Who is that?

125
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,375
[MAKISHIMA] His name's
Doctor Odagiri.

126
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,666
He's the research director

127
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,083
of the bottom level
of Relic's Point.

128
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,250
He's also the one who covered
for us back at the checkpoint.

129
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,500
[ODAGIRI] You're Sho Fukamachi,
right?

130
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,625
It's okay, you're safe now.

131
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,750
The cameras, sensors and
everything else

132
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:01,041
on the lowest level
are all under my supervision.

133
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:04,833
So as long as you're down here,
your presence will go unnoticed.

134
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,708
Welcome to what we call

135
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,083
the "free zone" here
at Relic's Point.

136
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:14,041
My name's Odagiri. My
research associates and I

137
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,375
are here to help you,
so don't worry.

138
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,083
Excuse me, where are my friends?

139
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,750
We let them know you were coming
to the lab,

140
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,000
so they should be
here any minute.

141
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,083
[SHO] Waitasec... Is that us?

142
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,083
[HAYAMI] This is what you
call a "dummy image".

143
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:41,125
The two of you will be seen
leaving here in 45 minutes.

144
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,750
3 hours later, you will join
a search team.

145
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,416
After a short while, the team
will split up

146
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,666
and lose sight of you.

147
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,708
Then it'll be like you
never existed at all.

148
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,208
It's all under control.

149
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,041
I'm Toshiaki Hayami.

150
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,208
I've been watching your battle
with Chronos.

151
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,375
Nice job, young man.

152
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,625
[SHO] Uh, nice to meet you!

153
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,500
Uh, there's no need to clap.

154
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,375
Sho!
[SHO] Tetsuro, it's you!

155
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,416
[TETSURO] Of course it is!

156
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,333
You're the one that
was in trouble!

157
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,208
It may sound cheesy, but now
that you're here,

158
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,958
it's like God
answered my prayers.

159
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,541
I know what you mean.

160
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,416
Tetsuro!
[TETSURO] Mizuki!

161
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,125
[MIZUKI] I'm so glad
you're all right.

162
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:25,333
Don't worry, Sho took good care
of me while you were gone.

163
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:29,583
[TETSURO] I know. It's okay now.
You don't have to cry.

164
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,250
[MIZUKI] Thank you...

165
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,416
All that matters is that the
two of you are safe.

166
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,041
[SHO] Mr. Onuma! Shizu!
This is great!

167
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,500
Everyone... everyone
made it out okay!

168
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:45,041
Uh, by the way, I don't see
Mr. Murakami anywhere.

169
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,250
 He's okay, isn't he?

170
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,125
Tetsuro, show them.

171
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,750
Yes, Sir.
Hold on, Mizuki.

172
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,666
What's wrong?

173
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,458
[TETSURO] There's nothing
to worry about.

174
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,875
It may look bad, but he's
still all right.

175
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,458
[SHO] Mu..Murakami?

176
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,416
[fluid bubbling]

177
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,666
Wh..What happened?

178
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,250
We think he's just resting.

179
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,708
He exhausted all of his energy
trying to save us.

180
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,375
Did you get attacked by Zoanoids
after we split up?

181
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,083
Yeah, tell us what happened!

182
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,125
Right after you guys ran off
into the woods,

183
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,000
Guyot showed up and attacked us.

184
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,250
It took everything Murakami
had to protect us.

185
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,875
[MURAKAMI] <i>No! How did he...</i>

186
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:47,791
[GUYOT] Now you've really pissed
me off, you filthy maggots!

187
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,500
He's powering up again!

188
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,833
[MURAKAMI] All right, listen up!

189
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,083
He's about to hit us with
another gravity attack.

190
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,250
Everyone gather around me, and
I'll try to hold it off!

191
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,583
[ALL] Right!

192
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,208
[GUYOT] I'll send every last
one of you to Hell!

193
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,041
Gravity Crusher!

194
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,958
What just happened? Is it over?

195
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,208
[GUYOT] A barrier?

196
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,750
I bet you think you're clever,
don't you?

197
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:19,416
I'll have to show you the
power of a true Zoalord,

198
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,000
you impudent lab rat!

199
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,458
[MURAKAMI] When he launches his
next attack,

200
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,125
have your gravity
controller ready.

201
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,958
[MAKISHIMA] All right.

202
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,500
[GUYOT] I'll pound your
bones into dust!

203
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,041
[MURAKAMI] Now!

204
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:40,166
[GUYOT] [laughs evilly] Behold
perfection incarnate!

205
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,458
Pay the price for your defiance!

206
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,666
[Makishima breathing heavily]

207
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,458
[MAKISHIMA] We barely
made it out alive.

208
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,250
[TETSURO] I can't believe you
could protect all of us

209
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,583
with your barrier.

210
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,500
That was pretty risky, given
your condition.

211
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,875
Are you gonna be okay?

212
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,000
[MAKISHIMA] Well, we somehow
managed to survive,

213
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,541
but it looks like we aren't
going anywhere.

214
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,416
Murakami...

215
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,166
Hey, Murakami!

216
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,166
This is bad,
I think he passed out!

217
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,791
[MAKISHIMA] What?!

218
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,875
[YOHEI] Water's flooding in!

219
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,666
Oh no, it looks like his
barrier is giving out!

220
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,541
What're we gonna do?

221
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,708
[MAKISHIMA] Damn it! At this
rate, we'll be buried alive.

222
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,791
Huh? There's a... cave?

223
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,166
Yohei, you and Shizu stand back.

224
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,041
I'll use my pressure cannon to
blow a hole in the wall

225
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,541
so we can escape to the cave.

226
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:32,208
Did you say "cave?" Hey, are you
sure this isn't a lake?

227
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,875
[MAKISHIMA] I'm positive.
Don't worry.

228
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,875
I can sense a large manmade
structure behind this wall.

229
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,166
It has to be... a tunnel!

230
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,291
[TETSURO] Watch your step,
it's slippery.

231
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,250
[SHIZU] Okay.

232
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,375
[MAKISHIMA]
It looks like the tunnel

233
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,791
is still under construction.

234
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,583
[YOHEI] They probably stopped
digging when they ran

235
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,458
into an underground water vein.

236
00:12:56,541 --> 00:13:00,375
From the looks of things, they
never bothered to clean up.

237
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,041
Makishima! Isn't this...

238
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,916
[MAKISHIMA] Yeah, I thought
this looked familiar.

239
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,333
We're back on the transport
line

240
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,250
we took to escape from
Relic's Point.

241
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,916
Now what should we do?

242
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,333
A breeze?

243
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,750
[MAKISHIMA] Looks like they
sent a reception.

244
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,375
[ODAGIRI] Wait! Don't shoot!
We're allies!

245
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,958
Our allies?

246
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,541
[ODAGIRI] We are those who
carry out

247
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,208
the will of Professor Yamamura.

248
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,750
You mean Murakami's old friend?
Who are you?

249
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,708
I'm Odagiri, a researcher
from Relic's Point.

250
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,916
We may work for Chronos,

251
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,208
but all the men in my
department

252
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,416
are sympathizers of
Professor Yamamura.

253
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,000
After the incident in Arizona,
we were forced to lay low.

254
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,458
We've been waiting all these
years

255
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,291
for an opportunity like this.

256
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,083
Please, let us help you fight.

257
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,833
[SHO] I... feel so worthless.

258
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,958
What do you mean, Sho?

259
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:07,333
Yamamura, Murakami, Odagiri...
They're all so brave.

260
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,291
They've given up everything for
their cause.

261
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,166
They risked their lives
to help this world.

262
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,041
But look at me. Even though I've
got the Guyver,

263
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,750
I've only thought of myself.

264
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,875
[TETSURO] Well, you protected
Mizuki, didn't you?

265
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,625
You risked your life to protect
my sister

266
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,625
and bring her back
safe and sound.

267
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,500
Thank you, Sho.

268
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,916
You don't have to thank me.

269
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,708
[MIZUKI] Hey, you guys!

270
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:36,083
Oh, I'm so sorry! You weren't,
like, having a moment, were you?

271
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,583
No! You got the wrong idea! We
were just talking about you!

272
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,916
[MIZUKI] You don't have to be
shy.

273
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,416
I know you two are
all lovey-dovey!

274
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,000
Okay, Mizuki, that does it!

275
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,875
[MIZUKI] When's the
wedding? [laughing]

276
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,291
[TETSURO] I said, cut it out!

277
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,458
You're really starting
to make me mad!

278
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,666
Professor Yamamura...

279
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,458
[SHIZU] Here, have some
herbal tea.

280
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:55,875
[ODAGIRI] Thank you.

281
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,791
It's made with chamomile leaves.
It'll help you relax.

282
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,541
[HAYAMI] This stuff is great!

283
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,041
[IJUIN] It sure is nice having a
girl around to cook for us.

284
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,000
[TORII] What'd you say this was?
Chamo... chamo...

285
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,833
[YOHEI] It's called
"chamomile," Sir.

286
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,833
It imparts a sense of

287
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:09,791
tranquillity.
[MAKISHIMA] Doctor.

288
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,708
Is Murakami doing any
better now?

289
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,500
[ODAGIRI] Well, there's been
improvement,

290
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,291
but he's still comatose.

291
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,458
For some reason, he's also
remaining in his battle form.

292
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,666
Fortunately, after we ran the
normal optimization process,

293
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,291
his damaged tissue healed.

294
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,708
But I'm not an expert on
Zoalords,

295
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,208
so when it comes down to the
specifics

296
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,416
of his nervous and energy
exchange systems,

297
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,000
I can only make inferences
based on my experience

298
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,541
with normal Zoanoids.

299
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,458
So you're saying there's nothing
we can do about the coma?

300
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,041
[ODAGIRI] No, he'll have to
recover on his own.

301
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,625
[MAKISHIMA] But this is serious!

302
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,416
As long as he stays in his
battle form,

303
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,666
he'll keep putting strain
on his body, right?

304
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,916
[ODAGIRI] Yes, I wish there
was something I could do.

305
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,625
Hm? Listen, none of you need to
worry about this mess,

306
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,333
just concentrate
on your work.

307
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,000
[IJUIN &amp; HAYAMI] Yes, Sir!

308
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:07,666
What's going on here?
An earthquake?

309
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,500
[MIZUKI] Ah, this feels great.

310
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:13,000
Wake me up when you beat
Chronos, okay?

311
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,166
[TETSURO] Oh no, you don't!
That's MY bed.

312
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,916
Go sleep in your own room!

313
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,625
[MIZUKI] No way. I'm scared.

314
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:22,000
What do you mean, you're scared?
We're safe down here.

315
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,666
[MIZUKI] I'm scared
of Makishima.

316
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,375
[TETSURO] You mean because he
killed all those people

317
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,375
in Takeshiro after
they turned into Zoanoids?

318
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,958
[MIZUKI] How could he do
something like that?

319
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,375
He just murdered them!

320
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,083
I thought I knew him!

321
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,958
I mean, we went to
the same school,

322
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,291
we talked to each other
every day!

323
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,583
We even served on the student
council together.

324
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:48,166
But now, I feel like I don't
know him at all.

325
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,875
Well, in that situation,

326
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,458
I'm sure he didn't have
much of a choice.

327
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,916
[MIZUKI] I know... I get it, all
right? But still...

328
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,583
It wasn't their fault they were
turned into Zoanoids.

329
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,791
They were no different
than Sho's da...

330
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:04,958
[TETSURO] Uh, hey, Sho. You
finished your bath already?

331
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,708
[MIZUKI] I'm sorry! I...

332
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,458
[SHO] Don't worry about it.

333
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,375
I think it's good to have
someone around

334
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,916
who can make level-headed
decisions like that.

335
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,416
Not like me.

336
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,166
Don't let it get you down, Sho.

337
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,166
There's nothing wrong with

338
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,833
feeling sympathy
for those people.

339
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,041
It's just that sometimes you
have to be a little heartless

340
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,416
in a situation like this.

341
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,625
[alarm going off]

342
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,541
What's wrong?

343
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,833
[SHO] Did something happen?

344
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,666
Guyot's coming. He picked a fine
time to pay us a visit.

345
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,000
[TETSURO] Oh no!

346
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,291
No way! Does that mean he
know's we're down here?

347
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,083
ODAGIRI] I doubt it.

348
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,583
He's probably just stopping by
to visit Dr. Shirai, as usual.

349
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,875
Wait, who's Dr. Shirai?

350
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,125
Although we rarely see him,

351
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,541
he's actually the top
researcher in our group.

352
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:54,750
He's obsessed with his work.

353
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,291
I suppose you could say he's
a bit eccentric.

354
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,875
That's why Dr. Odagiri is in
charge,

355
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,083
even if he's not the highest
ranked scientist here.

356
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:05,250
We're lucky Dr. Shirai is too
busy right now to notice us.

357
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,000
Doctor! Guyot's about to
be in range

358
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,541
of our surveillance cameras.

359
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,416
[IJUIN] It looks like he's
going to Shirai's lab.

360
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,875
What's he doing?

361
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,500
[MIZUKI] Why does Guyot keep
coming down here, anyway?

362
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,125
[HAYAMI] Funny you ask...

363
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,125
For whatever reason,

364
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,833
Dr. Shirai doesn't upload
his research data

365
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,750
to Relic's Point's
main computer.

366
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:30,375
His work's a complete mystery.

367
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,625
Whatever he's researching,

368
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,708
it looks like it's a secret even
to Dr. Barcas.

369
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,416
Even Barcas doesn't know?

370
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,375
What could they be doing?

371
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,916
[GUYOT] <i>I can't afford to</i>
<i>wait any longer.</i>

372
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,500
<i>Now that I've targeted</i>
<i>Murakami,</i>

373
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,125
<i>I'm sure Barcas is aware of</i>
<i>my true intentions.</i>

374
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,666
<i>He may have even reported</i>
<i>it to Arizona by now.</i>

375
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,666
<i>Damn you, Shirai.</i>

376
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,833
<i>If you can't build a Remover</i>
<i>soon, I'll be as good as dead.</i>

377
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,083
[odd vibration sounds]

378
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,875
<i>What is this power I'm sensing?</i>

379
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,833
[ODAGIRI] What's the matter?

380
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,000
We're receiving data from
the Relic, Sir.

381
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,666
[ODAGIRI] What does it say?

382
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,625
[TORII] There's a rapidly
intensifying biometric response!

383
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,416
[SHO] What are you
talking about?

384
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,291
[HAYAMI] Vibrations
rapidly increasing!

385
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,625
[IJUIN] None of the
potentiometers set up

386
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,416
around the relic are responding!

387
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,500
[ODAGIRI] Everyone, stay calm!
Remain at your stations

388
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,125
and record as much
data as possible!

389
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,458
[TORII] The biometric response
is intensifying!

390
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,750
[SHO] Wait, what do you
mean "biometric"?!

391
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,250
[ODAGIRI] The Relic is reacting.
It's alive.

392
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,833
[SHO] What?

393
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,333
[ODAGIRI] It may not appear so,
but the Relic is a living being.

394
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,416
[SHO] N-No way!

395
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,000
[ODAGIRI] I can't blame you for
your shock.

396
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,541
At first, I found it
hard to believe too.

397
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,125
But even the Creators'
spacecrafts

398
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,000
were living creatures
produced to fit their needs.

399
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:54,250
In that sense, they were no
different than humans.

400
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,416
Now you see that mankind is
not the only thing

401
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,291
the Creators left behind.

402
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,750
For tens of thousands of years,

403
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,958
another piece of their
legacy lay in wait,

404
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,708
surviving in a state of
suspended animation.

405
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,333
And still it lies, here within
this mountain,

406
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,791
imparting so
few of its secrets.

407
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,208
[MIZUKI] Tetsuro! Sho!
[TETSURO] What's wrong?

408
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,250
[MIZUKI] Something's
happening to Guyot.

409
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,958
It appears he's synchronizing
with the vibrations!

410
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,666
[HAYAMI] We've got
a problem, Sir!

411
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,250
Status report, Hayami?

412
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,083
[HAYAMI] It's the
optimization tank!

413
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,875
Murakami?!

414
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:28,958
[GUYOT] <i>What the hell</i>
<i>is going on?!</i>

415
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,916
[fluid bubbling]

416
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,833
[BARCAS] <i>What are these</i>
<i>vibrations?</i>

417
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,250
<i>They seem to be coming</i>
<i>from below.</i>

418
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,291
<i>It must be the ruins.</i>

419
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,375
<i>But what does it mean?</i>

420
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,333
[Guyot screams in pain]

421
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,416
Tetsuro, the door opened!

422
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,916
Yeah, the circuit shorted out.
[HAYAMI] I'll close it manually.

423
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,750
Yes, please!

424
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,583
We've got to act fast.
In its weakened state,

425
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,083
Murakami's body can't withstand

426
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,791
these vibrations
for much longer.

427
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:17,708
[GUYOT] <i>What the hell was that?</i>
<i>What just happened to me?</i>

428
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,500
[HAYAMI] There.

429
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,125
[SHO] Murakami!

430
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,416
Wait! Sho!

431
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,166
[GUYOT] It felt like the Relic
was calling out to me.

432
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,708
 Perhaps it was reacting to
my Zoacrystal.

433
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,833
But why? I've been down here
many times,

434
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,500
but that's never happened.

435
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,541
It felt like...

436
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,375
No, it couldn't be.

437
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,791
What's he doing?

438
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:50,250
I don't know. I've never seen
anything like this before.

439
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,041
[SHO] Murakami!

440
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:31,500
[NARRATOR] It's the calm before
the storm at Relic's Point.

441
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:34,541
Guyot desperately moves to
activate the Guyver Remover

442
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,791
as the Council of Zoalords
plot his demise.

443
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,916
But before he can, a mysterious
man

444
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,541
with terrifying power
blocks his path.

445
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:46,041
As the enemies of Chronos
assemble for an all-out attack,

446
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,791
Sho and Makishima seek to
uncover the mysteries

447
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,291
of an ancient relic.

448
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:54,375
Next time: "The Night Before
the Final Assault"
