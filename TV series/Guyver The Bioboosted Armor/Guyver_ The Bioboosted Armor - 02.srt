What do you think it is?

2
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:06,166
You got me. But you know...
it kinda looks like...

3
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:11,083
I think... I must have pushed
a switch or something.

4
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,708
It's like... it's alive!

00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,958
[GREGOLE] Damn you!

9
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:34,125
[SHO] Wh..what is that thing?
Is that... ME?

10
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:34,916
Hey, Sho...

11
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,708
[SHO] NO!

12
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,875
We're still missing two, but our
agents are looking into it.

13
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,708
We've gotten the police to
cordon off the site.

14
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,666
And what about the witnesses?

15
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,583
He goes to a local high school.

16
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,583
He should be easy enough
to find.

17
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,541
[KIMURA] Also, Inspector
Risker from headquarters

18
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,958
will be stopping by.

19
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,541
He's scheduled to meet with you
this afternoon.

[Genzo discontent]

21
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,208
[FUMIO] I'm coming in,
all right?

22
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,833
[SHO] Uh, yeah.

23
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:06,625
What's wrong?

24
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,083
Oh, yeah...

25
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,458
I was supposed to make
breakfast, wasn t I?

26
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,958
Forget about it.

27
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,583
I'm just afraid you might be
coming down with something.

28
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:18,250
It's nothing. I think I might
have a fever though.

29
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,291
I guess I should stay home
from school today.

30
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,708
That bad? Should I have Dr.
Inoue come make a house call?

31
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:24,875
I'm fine.

32
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:25,750
-Well, better safe than sorry...
I'm fine.

33
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,083
-Well, better safe than sorry...

34
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:27,333
-Well, better safe than sorry...
I said, I'm fine!

35
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,833
I'm sorry, Dad. But really, I
think I'll be okay.

36
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,583
[Sho] I'll call the Doctor if I
start feeling worse.

37
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,625
Well, all right. Just try to
take it easy today.

38
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,500
[TETSURO] Good morning!

39
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,500
[MIZUKI] Hi, Mr. Fukamachi!

40
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,750
Good morning, kids.

41
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,041
I'm afraid Sho's staying
home from school today.

42
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,125
Huh?

43
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,333
Is something wrong?

44
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:02,166
He... just has a cold.

45
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,375
I see. Well, then... We'll come
check on him after school.

46
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,541
Mhmm.

47
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,708
That's great. Thanks a lot.

48
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,500
[FUMIO] You get prettier every
time I see you, Mizuki.

49
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,750
[MIZUKI] Oh, stop it!

50
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,208
[FUMIO] You look just like your
mother used to.

51
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,708
[MIZUKI] Really?

52
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,083
Huh? I wonder what's going on?

53
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,208
[TETSURO] Oh, I just
remembered something.

54
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,958
You go ahead
without me, all right?

55
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,041
All right, then.

56
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,000
[TETSURO] Mr. Tanaka!

57
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,291
Oh, hey there, Tetsu.
Something wrong?

58
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,833
Oh, uh, just, what
happened at Mt. Narisawa?

59
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,541
Have you heard
anything about it?

60
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,375
Mt. Narisawa? Oh, dispatch
reported there was an explosion

61
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,875
or something up there.

62
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,750
The police went up and closed
off the area this morning.

63
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,916
[TETSURO] I see...

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,791
So. What's wrong? Do you
know something?

65
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,791
Uh, oh no! Not really.
Well, thank you very much.

66
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,916
[TETSURO] <i>Come on,</i>
<i>this is ridiculous.</i>

67
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,833
<i>There was a huge explosion,</i>

68
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,083
<i>the police blocked off</i>
<i>the whole area...</i>

69
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,208

70
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,166
<i>I bet they're trying</i>
<i>to cover this up!</i>

71
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,041
<i>No... that's taking it too far.</i>

72
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,083
Tetsuro! There you are.

73
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,416
Hey...

74
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,083
You got a sec? I have a question
about your report.

75
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,625
[TETSURO] Yeah? What is it?

76
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,583
This part says the monster
was accidentally created

77
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,333
through gene splicing.

78
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,250
[TETSURO] Yeah. So?

79
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,708
Isn't that idea kind
of outdated?

80
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:14,250
Oh, I see. Well, what if
the military created it?

81
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,416
Like a bioweapon.

82
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,625
Yeah, that works!

83
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,750
[TETSURO] <i>A bioweapon?!</i>

84
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:24,041
Ah? Tetsuro? Tetsuro!

85
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:27,208
[TETSURO] Y..yeah, let's
go with that.

[TETSURO] Jeez, don't
scare me like that!

92
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,791
Your dad said
you were kinda sick,

93
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,708
so I came by to
check up on you.

94
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,958
Ah, sorry. But I'm feeling a
whole lot better now.

95
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, that's sure a relief.

96
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,208
I'm glad it was nothing
serious, ya know.

97
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:12,125
[MIZUKI] Sorry I'm late! I hope
you don't mind rice porridge.

98
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,541
No, it's fine. I really
appreciate it!

99
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,125
It must be tough sometimes

100
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,875
with just you and your
dad living here.

101
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:22,041
Moms and sisters come in handy
at times like these, huh?

102
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,458
I appreciate the sentiment,
at least.

103
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,791
I guess while I'm here,

104
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,166
I might as well cook
dinner for your dad too.

105
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,083
He'll be home soon, won't he?

106
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,083
Yeah. Mizuki!

107
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,416
Huh?

108
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,750
Thanks a lot.

109
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,916
Ya know I'm kinda
surprised, Sho.

110
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's not like you to
miss school like this.

111
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,083
Are the big kids
picking on you?

112
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,875
Uh... Come on.

113
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,666
You can't exactly tell
her you were attacked

114
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,416
by some slimy
creature that...

115
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,625
gave you a fever.

116
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,083
Hey, not so loud!

117
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,083
Well, but you are okay
physically though, aren't you?

118
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:02,541
Actually... I've got, all these
weird growths on my back.

119
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,208
What do you mean?

120
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,583
Oh, man...

121
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,125
They're real creepy-looking.

122
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,416
Kinda like that pod
thing, ya know?

123
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,125
They were actually
a whole lot bigger

124
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,416
than when I first
noticed them last night.

125
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,916
I see. See, at
first I was thinking

126
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,375
they'd keep getting
bigger and bigger

127
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,375
'til they covered your
whole body.

128
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:27,625
Tetsuro, shut up! Don't even
joke about that, all right?!

129
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,166
I guess you think
this is funny, huh?

130
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,083
Since they're not
all over YOUR back.

131
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:34,375
Sorry about that! I didn't
mean it, Sho.

132
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,750
Well, in any case, you should
probably have a doctor

133
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,000
take a look at them.

134
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,333
Do you really think that
would be safe to do?

135
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,750
What are you talking about?

136
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,791
What happens if... those monster
soldiers show up again?

137
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,958
Oh, I see. Well,
they don't know that

138
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,458
you were the one who turned
into that pod creature.

139
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:54,291
Plus, it sank into the
pond after the fight.

140
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,541
Hey, don't worry about it! I
mean, if you think about it,

141
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,333
there's no way for
anyone to even know

142
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,041
we were up there in
the first place!

143
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:06,291
Hey wait a second! Those monster
guys saw your face, didn't they?

144
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,583
Huh?

145
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:08,875
[cry of realization]

146
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,000
[KIMURA] One of the recovered
units is currently on its way

147
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,791
to our Japanese Branch.

148
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,166
Also, we've more
or less identified

149
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,583
the high-school
student in question.

150
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,666
[GENZO] You idiot!

151
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,541
That wasn't a monster that you
ran into yesterday!

152
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,333
That was a Guyver unit!

153
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,708
[RAMOTITH] I apologize, Sir!
I m sorry!

154
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,958
If that creature wasn't a
Zoanoid,

155
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,708
then the only
logical explanation

156
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,958
is that it was one of the
missing Guyver units,

157
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,541
don't you think?

158
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,666
Only we have the capability to
create a bioweapon like that.

159
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,875
[RAMOTITH] Yes, Sir.

160
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,958
At any rate, I'm sending
you reinforcements.

161
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,333
Your orders now are to
capture that creature

162
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,916
and the other Guyver
units at any cost!

163
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
There are only three units
like that in the world.

164
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,625
Also, you need to find
that high school student

165
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,958
from yesterday.

166
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,166
He may know something
about the Guyver.

167
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,791
More importantly, we
can't let him go free

168
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:02,875
after seeing a Zoanoid.

169
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,041
[RAMOTITH] Yes, Sir!

170
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,083
Ridiculous! I'm surrounded by
an army of incompetant fools!

171
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,166
[RISKER] Well... we can't really
blame them can we?

172
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,000
After all, they were ordered to
recover the units

173
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,500
without understanding
their true nature.

174
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,416
Inspector Risker...

175
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,291
You see, Sir, even though
you're the highest official

176
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,916
in this organization, you
haven't even begun to understand

177
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,333
the true importance
of the Guyver units.

178
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,958
Only a fool would think of them

179
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,875
as some kind of
measley bioweapon.

180
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:39,666
[RISKER] Let me tell you a
secret, Mr. Makishima.

181
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,916
I don't suppose you know,
but in their language...

182
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,916
Guyver apparently means
"out of control".

183
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,791
What are you talking about?

184
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:53,166
[KIMURA] The recovered unit has
been delivered, Sir.

185
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,666
Just one for now, huh?
Care to see?

186
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,500
Yes, of course. That's
precisely what headquarters

187
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,875
sent me here to
investigate after all.

188
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:02,958
[RISKER]
But while I'm here,

189
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,166
let me make one thing
perfectly clear.

190
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,916
You've only remained president
of Max Pharmeceuticals

191
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,458
thanks to the
support of Chronos.

192
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,833
And as you know...

193
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,375
This latest mistake of yours,

194
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,375
might very well put your head
on the chopping block...

195
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,916
Mr. Director.

196
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,625
[Genzo disgruntled sound]

197
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,916
[ANNOUNCEMENT] The school day
has now concluded.

198
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,541
Any students still
in the building

199
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,875
must leave immediately.

200
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,291
[TETSURO] That thing
disappeared into the pond,

201
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,916
and nothing weird has
happened to us yet.

202
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,708
If we just lay low
and keep quiet,

203
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,333
maybe those people
will leave us alone.

204
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,416
So what are you
trying to tell me?

205
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,041
I'm just saying we should
probably be careful

206
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,958
and keep this a secret.

207
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,833
I've been thinking about
those guys with the helmets

208
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,375
we ran into at the pond,

209
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,833
and the more I think about it,
the more it seems like

210
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,041
they're some kind of trained
fighting force.

211
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,583
I can't shake the feeling

212
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:58,125
that some huge military
organization is behind it all.

213
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,833
Then there was that
giant monster...

214
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,500
and that pod thing that
attached itself to you.

215
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,791
They're connected somehow,

216
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,250
and I bet they're both some
kind of bioweapon.

217
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,500
[SHO] Bioweapon?

218
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,125
[TETSURO]
 You know, living creatures

219
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,750
produced through bioengineering
and genetic manipulation

220
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,041
to be used as weapons?

221
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,416
What?

222
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,791
[TETSURO] The pod thing
took down that giant monster

223
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:23,083
like it was nothing. It must
be incredibly powerful.

224
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:28,000
Man, I tell you what, Sho, if I
ever got holda powers like that,

225
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,083
I wouldn't let anyone
get in my way.

226
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,333
Man, you know how
great that would be?

227
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,250
Not afraid of anything!

228
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,833
What exactly are you getting at?

229
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,708
Are you trying to make
fun of me for being sick

230
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,958
after everything I went through?

231
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:44,000
I swear, this is all just
some kind of game to him.

232
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,583
He's such a kid.

233
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,500
[TETSURO] <i>Maybe I'm getting</i>
<i>a little too worked up</i>

234
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,666
<i>over all this... But if</i>
<i>I don't talk to somebody,</i>

235
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:10,125
<i>I feel like I'm gonna go crazy.</i>

236
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,000
Tetsuro Segawa, right?
-Yeah...

237
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,333
Listen, we need to ask you
a few questions

238
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,625
about the explosion that
occurred at Mount Narisawa.

239
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,291
You were in the area at the
time, weren't you?

240
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to ask you to come with us.

241
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,708
Detective?

242
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,625
[TETSURO] <i>So the police are</i>
<i>finally getting involved!</i>

243
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:29,541
Well?

244
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:30,750
-[SHO] Tetsuro!
Well?

245
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,625
What's going on here?

246
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,041
They're with the police
department.

247
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,708
They're investigating that
explosion we saw.

248
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,833
So you saw the explosion too?

249
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,291
[SHO] Well, I... uh...

250
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,875
Great, you can come along
with your friend.

251
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,750
Uh, heya, Tetsuro?

252
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,458
I really don't think this is the
way to the police department.

253
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,291
Huh?

254
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,666
Uhm, where are we going, Sir?

255
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,583
To our headquarters.

256
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,500
Something's not right...

257
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,333
[VAMORE] Get out.

258
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,750
Hey, are you guys

259
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,500
really police detectives?

260
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,416
I don't remember ever
saying that now.

261
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,750
[Sho screams]

262
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,833
[Tetsuro grunts]

263
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,208
[TETSURO] Those guys are...

264
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,708
I believe you two are
aquainted with this?

265
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,250
What happened to it? We need to
know its current location.

266
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,875
[TETSURO] I..I don't know.

267
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,125
Quit jacking around
with me, kid.

268
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,708
That creature saved your
arse the other day.

269
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,666
Now, spit it out. Tell me
where it's hiding.

270
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,625
I..I don't know. I swear!

271
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,208
Let me go, you bastard!

[TETSURO] Sho!

273
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,625
[VAMORE] Go ahead and have
some fun with him.

274
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:13,708
Stop it!

275
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:14,875
Right.

00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,000
Stop it! Please! Stop!

279
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,833
-Where do you think you're
going? Stop it! Please! Stop!

280
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,333
[TETSURO] Let him go! He
doesn't know anything!

281
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:33,250
That's right. So start talking
before it's too late, boy.

282
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:37,541
[TETSURO] The pond! The creature
disappeared into the pond!

Really? Ramotith! Tear the
little brat's arms off!

00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,750
I'm not lying! That's the truth!

00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,083
[VAMORE]
You're bluffing.

286
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,416
A Chronos detachment has
already checked the pond.

287
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,708
Chronos?

288
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,583
[VAMORE] I'm afraid you
may be underestimating

289
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,791
the urgency of this situation.

290
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,208

Look I'm telling you the truth!
You gotta believe me!

292
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,083
[VAMORE] Come on, kid!
Where's the Guyver unit?

293
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:04,083
[SHO] <i>Guvyer. It's called</i>
<i>Guyver...</i>

Guyver!

Bloody hell?!

297

-Sho!
Bloody hell?!

298
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,875
So that's it...

299
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,708
[VAMORE] That's the Guyver.

300
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,000
[SHO] It worked...

301

Wh..what's going on? 

302
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,875
Eat this!

303
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,833
What the?!

304

[Tetsuro screams]

305
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,666
[SHO] Did I just do that?

306
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,291
[VAMORE] Calm down!

307
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:54,250
Now we don't have to waste any
more time searching for it.

308
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:58,416
Remember, our mission is to
recover the Guyver unit!

309

[Ramotiths growling]

310
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,541
[TETSURO]
Those monsters were

311
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,875
disguising themselves as humans.

312
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,250
Capture him.

00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:24,750
[Ramotith death scream]

317
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,666
[SHO] This is the
Guyver's power?

318
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,541
Go on and bash him around
a bit if you have to!

319
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,250
[Ramotith screams and dies]

320
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,791
[Tetsuro screams]

321
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,208
[Tetsuro gibbers in fear]

322
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,750
[Ramotith roars]

323
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:57,041
I see. So that's why Gregole
was defeated so easily.

324
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,333
[Vamore transformation roar]

325
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,833
But I'm not like
Gregole or Ramotith!

326
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,291
I'm in a class of me own!

327
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,125
[Vamore laughs]

328
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,916
[VAMORE] How do you like my
high-output laser?

329
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That's not an oscillator either.

330
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:25,958
It's all part of me! I am a
perfect killing machine!

331
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,000
The ultimate bioweapon!

332
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,375
A bio laser? 

333
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,750
[Vamore laughs evilly]

334
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,666
[VAMORE] Meet your doom!

335
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,666
[VAMORE] Stand still!

336
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,666
[VAMORE] You can run
all you want,

337
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,125
but your fat little friend is
about to get vaporized.

338
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,666
[TETSURO] Sho!

339
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,250
[Sho grunts]

340
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,708
[VAMORE] What's this?

341
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,750
[VAMORE] Bloody hell!

342
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,916
[electrical discharges and
building reaction noise]

343
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,416
[Tetsuro terrifed]

344
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,000
[electrical discharges and
building reaction noise]

345
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,000
[expolsions]

346
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,916
[VAMORE] What?!

347
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,000
[MAKISHIMA]
So even Vamore

348
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:29,500
the Japanese Branch's strongest
bioblaster's been defeated.

349
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:33,708
The power the Guyver posesses
is truely incredible.

350
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,750
[SHO] Tetsuro...

351
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:44,916
[SHO] I... I don't know... what
we've gotten ourselves into.

352
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,833
[KIMURA] This is it.

353
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,291
[GENZO] They said it
was damaged.

354
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,750
[KIMURA]
Yes, the external metal casing

355
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,458
was scratched
during the explosion

356
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:03,791
but the internal organism
appears to be unaffected.

357
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,833
Would you care to see it?

358
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,166
[RISKER] This is the scratch?
It doesn't look so bad to me.

359
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,541
Inspector Risker!

360
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,250
[GENZO] Isn't that dangerous!?

361
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,458
[Genzo screams in surpise]

362
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,750
[KIMURA] Director!

363
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,666
[Risker grunts and
moans in pain]

364
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:55,625
[ominous music]

365
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,625
[NARRATOR]
Uneasy days and brooding anxiety

366
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:33,083
begin to plauge Sho, as
the Guyver casts a shadow

367
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,458
over his friendship
with Tetsuro.

368
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:38,208
Some hearts dance before
the fires of conflict,

369
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,625
while others tremble in fear.

370
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:43,208
Straining under the weight
of his failures,

371
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:47,041
the director of the Japanese
Branch lashes out in panic.

372
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:51,250
And in the shadows, a man
watches on with disdain.

373
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:54,083
Next time: "Inspector Risker"
