1
00:01:58,458 --> 00:01:59,500
[Sho screams]

2
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,083
[SHO] <i>It's called Guyver...</i>

3
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,500
Guyver!

4
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,791
[VAMORE] That's the Guyver!

5
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,833
[explosions]

6
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:10,666
[Ramotith death roar]

7
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,041
[SHO] <i>I wonder if my</i>
<i>body will be all right</i>

8
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,750
<i>after transforming like that.</i>

9
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,000
[FUMIO] Aren't you hungry, Son?

10
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:25,916
[Sho slight surprise]

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,083
You aren't still sick, are you?

12
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,666
No, I'm fine, Dad.

13
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,875
[FUMIO] <i>Oh, you know</i>
<i>that cement factory</i>

14
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,166
<i>that went out of business?</i>

15
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,125
[FUMIO] The lady next
door was telling me

16
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,916
that apparently a bomb or
something went off over there.

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,291
[Sho shocked]

18
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,208
[FUMIO] And then there was that
deal with the police car.

19
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:55,291
These days... you never
can tell. Just be careful.

20
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,166
There's some really crazy
stuff out there.

21
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,208
Know what I mean?

22
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,375
[SHO] Thanks for dinner!

23
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,416
Well, I guess I'm going
up to my room now.

24
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,833
You don't wanna watch TV?

25
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,166
[SHO] Nah, not today.

26
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,666
Oh yeah, Sho.
Next week we should...

27
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,916
That boy. I don't know
what's wrong.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,083
Oh well... I guess
he's just at that age.

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,291
There's a lot of crazy
stuff out there, he says.

30
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,750
He doesn't even know
the half of it. Man...

31
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,250
[crashing sound]

32
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,208
[Sho alarmed]

33
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,458
Who's there?!

34
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,375
[TETSURO] Sho, it's me!

35
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,750
Tetsuro? Oh...

36
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,958
What are you doing
outside my window?

37
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,250
[TETSURO] Don't you remember? I
used to sneak in like this

38
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,166
all the time back when
we were kids.

39
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,375
Come on man, lemme in.

40
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,000
Whatdoyamean when we were kids?

41
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,416
What the hell are you
talking about ?

42
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,291
[TETSURO] Shh, be quiet.

43
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,208
[SHO] All right...
Don't hurt yourself.

44
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,958
[TETSURO] Man, that's a lot
harder than it used to be.

45
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:22,125
That wore me out. Hey? What's
with the alarm clock, dude?

46
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,833
Oh, this thing? It's nothing!

47
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,250
I gotta be really careful,
you know.

48
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,291
[SHO] Oh yeah... me too, huh? 

49
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,083
You're fine. You shouldn't
have to worry Sho.

50
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,458
[TETSURO] It's not you
they're after.

51
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,250
It's the Guyver.

52
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,375
Yeah, but remember those guys at
the factory saw me transform.

53
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,500
But that doesn't really matter

54
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,583
since they're all
dead now, right?

55
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,375
They're all dead... 

56
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,083
[TETSURO] Don't let
it get to you.

57
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:55,833
I mean... they were monsters,
weren't they?

58
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,291
Anyway, you gotta make sure

59
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,666
those guys don't find out
anything about you.

60
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,291
You better stay away from my
house for the time being.

61
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,958
And I won't be coming
here anymore either.

62
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,083
I'm taking time off school too.

63
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,541
-No way...
[TETSURO] I don't want to

64
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,250
get other people
involved in our problems.

65
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,125
Of course, that doesn't
mean I'm just going to

66
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,083
hide out and do nothing.

67
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,875
I'm going to go try
talking to some people

68
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,083
on the world wide web.

69
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,416
It's a long shot,

70
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,458
but someone out there
might be able to help us.

71
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,791
[SHO] But... wouldn't it be
better just to go to the police?

72
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,875
Come on, use your head here!

73
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,375
[TETSURO] Those Chronos guys
are doing all this weird stuff

74
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,500
out in the open and the
police and media pretend

75
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,125
like nothing's happening at all.

76
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,583
Whoever those guys are,

77
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,125
I bet they have connections
all over the place. Sho...

78
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,625
Yeah?

79
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:41,166
All that happened today finally
opened my eyes.

80
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,291
This isn't science fiction we're
talking about. It's reality.

81
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,250
And if we're not careful, we
could both wind up dead.

82
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,875
[TETSURO] It's a matter
of survival.

83
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,250
Survival?

84
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,291
To be totally honest with you,
I think it would

85
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:56,000
probably be best if we both left
town as soon as possible.

86
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,625
[TETSURO] But we can't just
leave our families behind.

87
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,583
Tetsuro, hold on a minute!

88
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,083
[TETSURO] We should at least
think about changing schools.

89
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,750
We'll go to different ones,
of course.

90
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:06,958
Okay, good.

91
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,208
C'mon! This is
completely insane!

92
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,083
[SHO] What if I don't want
to change schools?

93
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,375
You can't just burst in here
and start deciding

94
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,041
what I can and can't do!

95
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,541
Listen, this a matter
of life or death!

96
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,250
[TETSURO] I don't think you
realize the situation here!

97
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,833
You're a part of this too!

98
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,291
Okay, I get it.

99
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,041
You don't have to shove it
down my throat like that.

100
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,375
[TETSURO] You DON'T get it!
For as long as I've known you,

101
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,291
you've always been the type to
let the world pass you by.

102
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,458
You can't just sit around
and wait!

103
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,166
Yeah, and you've always been
the type of person

104
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,958
who jumps the gun, haven't
you, Tetsuro?

105
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,458
[TETSURO] Yeah, i's called
"seizing the opportunity!" 

106
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:43,291
[SHO] Faster doesn't always
mean "better", you know.

107
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,666
You need to slow down and
give this more thought.

108
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,291
Coming up with a plan is better
than sitting and doing nothing! 

109
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,125
I'm being cautious, all right?

110
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,541
I'm being cautious too!

111
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,500
You're being reckless!

112
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,416
When we found the unit by the
pond, you were the one who...

113
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,750
[building reaction noise]

114
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,708
Hey! I'm done with the shower!

115
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,166
[SHO] Uh... Okay!

116
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:16,166
[TETSURO] Listen...
I'm going home.

117
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,291
Hey!

118
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,875
Tetsuro... I'm... going
to think this over.

119
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,833
Yeah, whatever.

120
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,708
[GENZO] I can't believe he was
able to defeat Vamore!

121
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:34,500
The Guyver's abilities are
beyond comprehension.

122
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,083
Just look at Inspector Risker.

123
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:40,166
When he merged with the Guyver,
he gave off readings far greater

124
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,708
than even the most
powerful Zoanoids.

125
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,333
I had no idea it was
that powerful.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,875
[GENZO] We have to remedy this
mistake at all costs!

127
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:56,458
Has there been any progress in
the search for the missing unit?

128
00:07:56,541 --> 00:08:00,875
It seems to have slipped through
our blockade at Mount Narisawa.

129
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:04,375
Yes, we discovered signs
indicating that the unit was

130
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,541
appropriated after
the explosion.

131
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,041
Judging by the footprints
we found in the area,

132
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,666
we assume that someone took
it from the site.

133
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,500
What do you mean "someone"?

134
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,875
Welcome back home, Father.

135
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,666
I finished next year's
operations research.

136
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,125
If you'd like to read it, it's
on the desk in your study.

137
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,291
I want you to launch an
immediate investigation

138
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,166
to find out if anyone else
is involved in this!

139
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,875
[MAKISHIMA]
Father, is something wrong?

140
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,041
If there's anything
I can do to help...

141
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,458
You stay out of this,
understand me?

142
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,375
[MAKISHIMA] So this isn't
an issue with the company

143
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,708
but with Chronos.

144
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,125
When I say "stay out",
you stop asking questions!

145
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,875
You need to learn your
place, boy.

146
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,291
[MAKISHIMA] <i>You should</i>
<i>worry less about business</i>

147
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:55,083
<i>and more about saving</i>
<i>your neck, Genzo Makishima.</i>

148
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:58,750
<i>You won't be getting the units</i>
<i>back... not a single one.</i>

149
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,041
[MEDICAL STAFF MEMBER]
No abnormal readings.

150
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,125
[MEDICAL STAFF MEMBER]
It looks like

151
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,416
you haven't been
affected by the unit.

152
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,708
No, it's changed me.

153
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,875
Bring back up the
data you collected

154
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,375
when I merged with
the Guyver unit.

155
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,458
[MEDICAL STAFF MEMBER] Yes, Sir.

156
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,458
[RISKER] To think that I could
achieve such tremendous power...

157
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,291
I wonder what the
look on his face

158
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,166
would be if he found
out about this?

159
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,875
[laughs]

160
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,875
I'm so stupid.

161
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,875
I really didn't mean to get
angry at Tetsuro like that...

162
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,916
[SHO] See you later. Oh, I'll
take out the trash, okay?

163
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,041
[Fumio agrees]

164
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,125
Bye.

165
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,958
[MIZUKI] What do you mean,
you're taking off school

166
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:55,583
for a while? Are you getting
sick or something, big brother?

167
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,500
[TETSURO] None of your business!

168
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,083
None of my business?

169
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,583
You can't do whatever you want,

170
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,666
just because Mom and Dad
are out of town!

171
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,875
Oh wait, I get it.

172
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,416
Your diet didn't work out

173
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,583
and you don't wanna take the
physical exam at school!

174
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:07,500
[TETSURO] Shut up!

175
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,083
Oh, whatever! 

176
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,958
[relieved sigh]

177
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,958
Oh, pardon me.

178
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,500
[MIZUKI] Hey, what's going
on with Tetsuro?

179
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,958
Did something happen to him?

180
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,541
He said he wasn't coming to
school all of a sudden.

181
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,458
I dunno why, but he's been
acting really strange.

182
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,416
 So have you, Sho.

183
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,291
How's that?

184
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,791
It was just a feeling.

185
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,333
But it looks like I was right.

186
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,250
I know you guys have always
tried to keep secrets from me.

187
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:45,791
But still. Playing hookey
is going too far!

188
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:46,958
[MIZUKI] Come on! What's up?

189
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,500
Nothing...

190
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:49,791
I'm not stupid, you know!

191
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,375
[SHO] Just forget about it!

192
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,875
So, what do we need
to forget about?

193
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,250
Oh, hey! Good morning,
Makishima!

194
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,875
Is this about the
student council?

195
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,375
Oh, no.

196
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,125
It's nothing important, really.
Oh, I wanted to ask you,

197
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,583
what are we doing for the column

198
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,791
in the next Student
Council Newsletter?

199
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,125
Well, why don't YOU try
writing it this time?

200
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,291
Huh?

201
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,833
[MAKISHIMA] I'll help you out,
all right?

202
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,125
[MIZUKI] Are you sure?
It's really okay?

203
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,875
Hey, Sho!

204
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,583
[MAKISHIMA] <i>He doesn't look</i>
<i>like much, but he's a Guyver.</i>

205
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,333
<i>He's worth using.</i>

206
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,500
Hey, who do you think you are?

207
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,541
What are you doing
behind my desk!

208
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,125
Get up and put out that cigar!

209
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,000
You know,
Commander-in-Chief Guyot

210
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,750
is on his way to
Japan right now.

211
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,375
What? Commander-in-Chief Guyot?!

212
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,458
[RISKER] As I'm sure you know,
you'll be held accountable for

213
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:46,250
the loss of our company's
top-secret Guyver Units.

214
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,125
But thanks to you,
we should be able to

215
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,166
get an idea of how
the units operate.

216
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,083
That should make it a little
easier for us to recover them.

217
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:56,375
So you say, but those Zoanoids
you were so proud of

218
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,333
were powerless up
against the Guyver.

219
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,750
It's my responsibility.

220
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,166
I'll find a way to
recover that Guyver.

221
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,708
[gasps]

222
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,416
From now on, I'll take care
of the Guyver s recovery.

223
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,833
You've allowed them to run wild
for far too long.

224
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,791
[Risker] I'd start
coming up with excuses

225
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,083
to tell the Commander-in-Chief
while you still can.

226
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,541
Now, the only one who can
capture the Guyver

227
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,291
is another Guyver.
Ya catchin my drift?

228
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,291
Kimura!

229
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,333
[Risker laughs]

230
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,250
Bastard!

231
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:40,416
I'll go. Let me handle this.

232
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,333
[GENZO] Looks like you're the
only one I can count on.

233
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,125
The Japanese Branch must recover
the units no matter what!

234
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,041
You can't let Risker get
to them before you do!

235
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,416
Sir!

236
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:02,416
Hey Fukamachi, you forget
your gym clothes, dude?

237
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,875
[MISAWA] We're having physical
exams in fifth period today!

238
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,791
You haven't eaten lunch
either, have you?

239
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,208
I had a ton to eat,

240
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,166
so I'll have plenty of energy
for the strength test.

241
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,000
[KAWADA] Yeah, but now you're
gonna be overweight.

242
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,708
[KOBASHI] Aw, shut up, man!

243
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,291
[MISAWA] Anyway, you should at
least take your shirt off, Sho.

244
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,833
Where ya goin?!

245
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,166
<i>Don't tell me we're</i>
<i>out of coffee.</i>

246
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:35,208
When we found the unit by the
pond, you were the one who...

247
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,791
Damnit! I have too
much work to do!

248
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,625
I don't have time
to be sleeping!

249
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,000
They wouldn't attack
me in broad daylight

250
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:48,083
in the middle of a neighborhood,
would they? Nah...

251
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,291
[SHO]
<i>I don't think they went away.</i>

252
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,083
<i>I hope they didn't get bigger.</i>

253
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,166
[MAKISHIMA] Fukamachi?

254
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,125
Sorry, am I disrupting your
train of thought?

255
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:00,833
[SHO] Oh, no...

256
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,875
[MIZUKI] Huh? Sho?

257
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,125
[MIZUKI] Don't you have a
physical this afternoon?

258
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,125
Mizuki! Um, shouldn't you be
in class or something?

259
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,583
Well, we were just discussing

260
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,708
the next student
council news column.

261
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,125
It's usually my job, but
I asked Segawa to write it

262
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,708
because I've been
so busy lately.

263
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,250
It's nice to have
reliable council members

264
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,291
like her to help me out.

265
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,833
If you don't mind, you can help
write the report too.

266
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,541
What do you say, Sho?

267
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,333
That's great, Sho!

268
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,125
[MIZUKI] This is a really
good opportunity!

269
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:34,083
I'm sorry. Thanks, but I really
gotta go home for the day!

270
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:38,166
[MIZUKI] Hey, wait! What about
your checkup? Sho!

271
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,916
[MIZUKI] I'm sorry. He's been
acting really strange lately.

272
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,750
It's all right, but listen...

273
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,208
Let's talk about that column.

274
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,958
Yeah, sure thing!

275
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,291
Jeez, Sho!

276
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:54,250
[MAKISHIMA] <i>Aah...</i>
<i>So that's how it is.</i>

277
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,750
Anyway, what were you saying?

278
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,541
[MISAWA] I guess Fukamachi
isn't showing up, huh?

279
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,916
Man, I really envy the kids that
are in good shape right now.

280
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,250
No kidding. I'm worried
about my liver, dude!

281
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,625
Oh no, I'm being followed.

282
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,083
Tetsu, is that you? Why
aren't you in school?

283
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:31,375
Oh, Mr. Tanaka.
I, uh, caught a cold. [coughs]

284
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,666
I'm sorry to hear that. You seen
a doctor about that cough?

285
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,166
Uh, yes, Sir. But, uhm...

286
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,166
I feel like that black BMW over
there might be following me.

287
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,500
That one over there?

288
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,125
Yeah, they've been
with me a while.

289
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,416
I see... Hold on.
I'll check it out.

290
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,625
[TANAKA] Ahh, excuse me.
Where are you...

291
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:55,541
Oh, I see. There's one in the
park. Yeah, that park.

292
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,833
Needed a restroom.

293
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,083
Huh?

294
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,291
[TANAKA] She was just
looking for a restroom

295
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,875
for her little boy to use.

296
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,291
[TETSURO] Oh...

297
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,833
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

298
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,041
You know that area up at Mt.
Narisawa you were

299
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,166
asking about earlier has just
been reopened.

300
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,083
Mount Narisawa?

301
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,208
[TETSURO] Sho?

302
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,375
[SHO] Tetsuro...

303
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,000
[TETSURO] Why aren't
you at school?

304
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,875
[SHO] We have physical exams
today and... well,you know.

305
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,041
Anyway, my feet
just sort of took me

306
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,750
in this direction, ya know.

307
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,833
[TETSURO] I guess I felt like
coming here too.

308
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,041
[SHO]
Standing here with you

309
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:39,291
sure brings back
alotta memories.

310
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,833
We were pretty excited the first
time we came here, remember?

311
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,208
Yeah, cause' we
thought we had uncovered

312
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,666
some kind of hidden
swamp or something.

313
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,875
[TETSURO] Of course, everyone
knew about this place,

314
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,125
but we acted like it
was our secret hideout.

315
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,041
We didn't even tell Mizuki, huh?

316
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,875
[SHO] I wonder if
someday we'll be able to

317
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,166
look back at what's
happening now and laugh?

318
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,541
[GERGOLE]
Target sighted.

319
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,500
Securing him now, Sir!

320
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,458
Dammit!

321
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,833
Those guys again!

322
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,083
Sho! Get out of here now!

323
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,458
I'm the one you guys are
looking for, not him!

324
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,291
Take me and let him go!
-Tetsuro, no!

325
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,625
All of our units' helmets

326
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:18,458
have video recorders
installed in them.

327
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,375
So, the footage from
the fight with Vamore

328
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,541
was transferred straight
to our headquarters.

329
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,291
[Gregole transformation roar]

330
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,541
[GREGOLE] We know that you're
the Guyver!

331
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,458
 Recover the unit at all costs!

332
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,666
[SHO] <i>I have to protect</i>
<i>Tetsuro... Here goes.</i>

333
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,208
I won't run away!

334
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:35,916
Guyver!

335
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,416
Sho, wait!

336
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,958
[SHO]
Tetsuro! Here's your chance!

337
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,000
You have to get out of here!

338
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,916
[GREGOLE] You can't escape me!

339
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,333
We'll see about that!

340
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,708
[TETSURO] Come on, Sho, run!

341
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:50,375
[GREGOLE] Little punk...
[TETSURO] Come on, Sho, run!

342
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,583
[CADAN] Forget him.

343
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,208
[GREGOLE] Follow the Guyver!

344
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,708
[GREGOLE] In the name of
the Japanese Branch...

345
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,333
we'll capture you!

346
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,666
[GREGOLE] No!

347
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,208
[Gregole death scream]

348
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,416
Whoa!

349
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,791
You did it! Sho!

350
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:14,791
[SHO] Tetsuro!

351
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,208
[screams]

352
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,875
[SHO] Tetsuro!

353
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:21,958
[SHO] Are you all right? 

354
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,625
[TETSURO] Yeah, but look!

355
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:28,083
So you were able to wipe out
five Zoanoids at once.

356
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:31,291
That's quite impressive.
However...

357
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,666
[voice deepening]
Your time is up.

358
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,583
I'm not like them. I'm
in a class of my own!

359
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,166
[SHO] What the...

360
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,750
[SYNEVITE] I, Synevite, will
bring you to your knees!

361
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,708
[SHO] All right then, follow me!

362
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,208
Wait, Sho!

363
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:59,875
[SHO] <i>Okay, I'll just use this</i>
<i>again. What? I can't shoot!</i>

364
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,375
[SYNEVITE] Bwhaha, it's
massive power output

365
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,750
restricts it from
firing more than once.

366
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,250
[SHO] Arghh...

367
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,333
[SHO] Hoo-ya.

368
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,583
[Synevite chuckles]

369
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:17,000
[SYNEVITE] You're
wasting your time.

370
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,250
[SYNEVITE]
My body is soft and pliant.

371
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,666
It can absorb and
diffuse all impact.

372
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,666
You can't win!

373
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,833
[SYNEVITE] Your back is exposed,
Guyver!

374
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,666
[SHO] Damn it!

375
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:40,041
[Sho grunts in pain]

376
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,416
Sho...

377
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,375
[Sho grunts in pain]

378
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,208
[SYNEVITE] Ha ha ha...
I've done it...

379
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,083
[SYNEVITE]
I've really done it!

380
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,625
I've captured the Guyver,
just as ordered!

381
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,791
This is the power of Synevite!

382
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:12,916
[SHO] <i>I... I can't move.</i>
<i>Is this... the end?</i>

383
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,750
Sho! You can't lose now!
Don't give up!

384
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,791
[SYNEVITE] Useless worm!

385
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:22,750
Those who witness the secrets
of Chronos must perish!

386
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,708
[SHO] Don't you dare...
touch him...

387
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,166
[SYNEVITE] You still move?

388
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:31,291
[SHO] <i>Guyver, give me the</i>
<i>power... to defeat him!</i>

389
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:38,916
[SYNEVITE] I..impossible!
How could he...

390
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:48,708
I see. That looks like the
Guyver's... third weapon.

391
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,000
[SYNEVITE] Die!

392
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,250
[spinning growl]

393
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,916
[SYNEVITE] N..no!

394
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,583
[Synevite's death rattle]

395
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,125
[TETSURO] Are you okay?!
[SHO] Tetsuro!

396
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:21,083
That was great! Listen, I'm
not gonna run anymore.

397
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,083
We can face this, Sho.

398
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,333
[RISKER] That power
is completely wasted

399
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,750
on someone like you.

400
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,666
You can barely even defeat
a pathetic little Zoanoid.

401
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,916
Oh no, not another one!

402
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
[RISKER] Don't mistake me for
trash like them.

403
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,583
I'm Risker, an inspector
from Chronos.

404
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:41,791
However... I'm also... Adapt!

405
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:43,708
[SHO] Great...

406
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:49,125
[RISKER] A Guyver, like you.

407
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:53,375
No, it can't be...
He's a second, Guyver?

408
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,833
[dramatic music crescendo]

409
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,750
[NARRATOR] A second Guyver
has appeared before Sho.

410
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:34,625
Is he his enemy, or his ally?

411
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,833
The two fall into
a one-sided battle

412
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,375
and an unexpected conclusion.

413
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:42,250
Commander-in-Chief Guyot
and his subordinates

414
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,625
have finally arrived in Japan.

415
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:49,375
Those who believe only in
power begin to take control.

416
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:52,458
The deafening roar of a
hyper-Zoanoid thunders

417
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:54,791
through an empty schoolhouse.

418
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,708
Next: "The Visitor at Dusk"
