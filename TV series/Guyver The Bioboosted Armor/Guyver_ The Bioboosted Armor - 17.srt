1
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:06,500
<i>I... I'm still here.</i>

2
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,625
<i>I'm still alive.</i>

3
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:20,291
<i>The creation of</i>
<i>mankind...</i>

4
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:25,916
<i>bioweapons... Chronos...</i>
<i>Zoanoids...</i>

5
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,458
<i>the Creators... Guyvers...</i>

6
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,375
<i>It's all so overwhelming.</i>

7
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:36,500
<i>What can we do against</i>
<i>enemies like that?</i>

8
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,791
<i>How are we supposed to deal</i>
<i>with something so huge?</i>

9
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,041
<i>How can we fight back?</i>

10
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:46,625
<i>It seems pointless</i>
<i>to even try.</i>

11
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:51,125
<i>But... Sho's known that all</i>
<i>along from the very beginning.</i>

12
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,166
<i>While I was living a</i>
<i>normal life...</i>

13
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,291
<i>he was carrying that weight.</i>

14
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,041
<i>No matter how badly</i>
<i>he's beaten,</i>

15
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,833
<i>he still keeps fighting.</i>

16
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:09,625
<i>No matter how hopeless it</i>
<i>seems, he never gives up.</i>

17
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,375
<i>What have I been doing?</i>

18
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,083
<i>All this time, I've just</i>
<i>been running away.</i>

19
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,416
<i>He's been carrying that</i>
<i>burden all alone...</i>

20
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,750
<i>and I've been too</i>
<i>afraid to help.</i>

21
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,875
[ZX-TOLE] Judging by all
these scars on the ground,

22
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,000
I'd say this is where

23
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,500
that Zoanoid and the
Guyver faced off.

24
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:40,083
[DERZERB] Musta been one
hell of a fight.

25
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,500
[GASTER] Yeah.

26
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,625
[ELEGEN]
That gash must have been made

27
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,166
by the Guyver's megasmasher.

28
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,750
[ZX-TOLE] But look, this one
is different.

29
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,791
[DERZERB]
Just looks like it came from

30
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:52,291
one of Vamore's
biolasers to me.

31
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,208
[ZX-TOLE] C'mon, look at
that trench!

32
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,875
You really think a measly Vamore
could do something like that?

33
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,333
I'm the only Zoanoid

34
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,500
that can come close to
firing a laser that powerful!

35
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,750
[ELEGEN] Then what about
this one?

36
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,541
[DERZERB] Well, the guy
making the report

37
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:09,500
DID say the Zoanoid was
overpowering the Guyver.

38
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,666
[GASTER] The poor bastard
must have gotten vaporized

39
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,958
by that giant biolaser.

40
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,625
[ELEGEN] You don't think he was
being targeted, do you?

41
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,958
I mean, by the Zoanoid.

42
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,083
[ZX-TOLE] There's no telling.

43
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,041
Found anything?

44
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,416
[ALL] Doctor Barcas!

45
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,000
[ZX-TOLE] Sorry, Sir, but
we were too late.

46
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:33,250
The Guyver and the rogue
Zoanoid have left the area.

47
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,458
[BARCAS] No matter.
[ZX-TOLE] Sir?

48
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,000
Be careful.
Something's wrong here.

49
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,583
[ZX-TOLE] What do you mean, Sir?

50
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,291
This is a bit suspicious,
isn't it?

51
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,958
The appearance of the Guyver
is one thing

52
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:50,791
but I'm more concerned about
this unidentified Zoanoid.

53
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:54,458
For some reason, I can't reach
him with my mind-control.

54
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,166
Although, I didn't have
much to work with,

55
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,500
I looked over the data

56
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:02,000
for all the Zoanoid types
developed here in Japan.

57
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,708
I had to get down
to the irregular

58
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,583
and failed attempts before
I found a match.

59
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,458
Only one has a laser
like you mentioned.

60
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,958
[ZX-TOLE] What do you mean?

61
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,375
A Zoanoid unknown to the world.

62
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,500
An irregular creation that

63
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,041
should not have
appeared here in Japan.

64
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,708
Actually, this creature
is so unique

65
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,375
that I'm not really certain you
can call it a Zoanoid at all.

66
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,416
[ZX-TOLE] If it's not a Zoanoid,
then what could it be?

67
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,375
[Elegen screams in surprise]

68
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,250
[ZX-TOLE] Elegen!

69
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,125
[DERZERB] Elegen!

70
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,791
[Elegen screams in fear]
[BARCAS] Stay back!

71
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:37,000
Listen, Elegen, can you hear me?
Use your electric shock!

72
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,291
[Elegen screams in pain]

73
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,083
[GASTER] Elegen?

74
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,916
[ZX-TOLE] This isn't good. He's
lost control of his voltage.

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
[BARCAS] <i>Is that who I</i>
<i>think it is?</i>

76
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,500
[ZX-TOLE] Something's latched
onto him! Is that a Zoanoid?

77
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,875
[DERZERB] Whatever it is
it's smiling!

78
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:03,291
[GASTER] You son of a bitch!
Who the hell are you?!

79
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,541
[Aptom snorts in derision]
[BARCAS] <i>Aptom!</i>

80
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:10,416
[DERZERB] Aptom? That guy from
the Lost Numbers?!

81
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,541
[APTOM] Now that I'm
in control of Elegen,

82
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:16,500
we can finally have a little
chat, right, Dr. Barcas?

83
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:20,208
As you know, the Lost Numbers
aren't like normal Zoanoids.

84
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:23,541
We can't be mind-traced or
controlled by Zoalords.

85
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,583
That's why I've been able to
move around undetected.

86
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,958
After all the re-optimizations
you performed on me,

87
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,708
our link has become so weak

88
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,375
that I'm completely
beyond your grasp

89
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,625
unless I equip that special
transceiver of yours.

90
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,208
[BARCAS] So now you show your
true colors!

91
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,916
I knew you were up to something
when you ceased contact,

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,333
but turning on your comrades!

93
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:48,541
I won't tolerate defiance!
Now release Elegen this instant!

94
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,791
I'm afraid I can't do that.

95
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,708
I need Elegen to
help me regenerate

96
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,666
after my battle with the Guyver.

97
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,833
If I siphon his lifeforce,
I can regenerate myself.

98
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,708
[GASTER] Elegen...

99
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:01,958
[ZX-TOLE] It can't be!

100
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:05,166
You mean HE'S the
unidentified Zoanoid?!

101
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,583
[BARCAS] You ungrateful swine!

102
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:14,000
Have you no gratitude for the
man who gave you these powers?!

103
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,500
Hmph! Don't make me laugh.

104
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:17,791
This is the price you pay

105
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,875
for using a human as
your personal guinea pig.

106
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:24,041
It was your experimentation
that set me free!

107
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,875
Thanks to your
incessant tinkering,

108
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,708
your mind control
doesn't affect me,

109
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,500
so I'm no longer forced to
submit to your will!

110
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,083
That's right, Doctor,

111
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:35,166
I have evolved far beyond the
limits of your lowly Zoanoids!

112
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,250
What you see before you is the
birth of a new lifeform

113
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,125
that refuses to bow to your
pompous threats!

114
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,083
[Barcas gasps]

115
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,416
[APTOM]
Observe, Doctor,

116
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,958
I can absorb Zoanoids
into my body,

117
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,166
and by converting their bio
matter into energy,

118
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,333
I acquire their
special abilities

119
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,375
and incorporate
them into my own.

120
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,791
With each new victim,

121
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,625
I evolve into an even more
powerful battle creature!

122
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,875
What do you think of
your creation?

123
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,666
I... I had no idea...

124
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,125
[APTOM] You've let all that
power go to your head, old man.

125
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,625
It's made you careless.

126
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,916
All this time, I was nothing
but an experiment to you,

127
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,583
but perhaps you should have
been more mindful

128
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,500
to what the outcome of that
experiment would be!

129
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,708
Look at that,

130
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,375
in just a few minutes
I've already been able to

131
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,041
assimilate Elegen's
body into my own.

132
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:28,083
Can you feel it? Our psychic
link is starting to fade away.

133
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,750
[Barcas growls angrily]

134
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,500
Well, it's been fun!
Farewell, Doctor!

135
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,750
[BARCAS]
ZX-Tole, Derzerb, Gaster!

136
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,416
Dispose of this
traitor immediately!

137
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,250
[DERZERB] You son of a
bitch, how dare you?!

138
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:45,583
I'll bathe you in the
fires of Hell!

139
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,500
I hate to break it to you,

140
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,666
but the fires of Hell aren't
really cutting it.

141
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,916
[ZX-TOLE] It's no use.

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,583
His heat resistance is
the same as Elegen's!

143
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,166
[ZX-TOLE] Look out!

144
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,000
[Derzerb roars in pain]

145
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,625
[ZX-TOLE] Derzerb!
[DERZERB] Bastard...

146
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:08,083
[GASTER] Let me handle this!
All projectiles, fire!

147
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,208
[GASTER] Did I get him?
[Aptom laughs]

148
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,666
Not bad! That's a pretty
interesting attack

149
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,250
you've got there, Gaster!

150
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,458
Next time, I'll have to
absorb you!

151
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:34,666
Until then, be sure to stay
alive, all right?

152
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,875
[Aptom laughs evilly]

153
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:45,166
[ZX-TOLE] This Aptom is a
formidable opponent.

154
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,291
Mizuki...

155
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,041
Mizuki...

156
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,208
Mizuki?

157
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,750
Come on, please be all right.

158
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,708
Mizuki!

159
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,750
You're safe! Thank God!

160
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,833
[MIZUKI] Where WERE you?

161
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,083
I can't believe you kept me
waiting for so long!

162
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,833
This is dangerous, you know!

163
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,250
What would I have done if
a Zoanoid showed up, huh?

164
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,333
You can't just leave me alone!
I need you to protect me!

165
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,375
Well, yeah, but...

166
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,625
[MIZUKI] No buts about it!

167
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,583
You've been like this as
long as I've known you!

168
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,291
No matter what happens, you're
always slow to catch on,

169
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,708
and when you do finally
go out and do something,

170
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,208
you always come back late.

171
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,916
You never tell me where
you're going either.

172
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,125
You know, we're
not kids anymore,

173
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,916
so you gotta be more
responsible, all right?

174
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,625
Yeah, you're right, sorry.

175
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,666
[MIZUKI] I'm just kidding.

176
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,833
I'm glad you're safe.

177
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,291
You really scared me.

178
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,958
Mizuki...

179
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,833
I'm just happy to see you again.

180
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,041
I was afraid you weren't
coming back.

181
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,250
It's okay.

182
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:10,708
Remember what I said? No matter
what, I'll always protect you.

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,250
Sho, I'll be okay now.
I think I'm ready.

184
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,250
No matter what happens,
I won't run away.

185
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:25,583
Because I know that I'm a
part of all this too.

186
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:29,375
Wherever you guys go,
that's where I belong.

187
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,541
Okay?

188
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,083
Good morning, Sho!

189
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,083
Hi, g..good morning, Mizuki!

190
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:08,041
Uh, I... I guess you're
hungry, huh?

191
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,375
Yeah...

192
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,166
[MIZUKI] You didn't have
dinner yesterday, did ya?

193
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,583
Well no, not really.

194
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:27,625
So what do you think...
we should do now?

195
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:32,041
I mean, I wonder what happened
to Tetsuro and the others?

196
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,833
[SHO] Listen, for now, I think
we should just look for

197
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,458
someplace safe to stay.

198
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:44,208
Wh..What do you mean by that?
[SHO] Well, I was thinking...

199
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,166
we should try going someplace
where there's a lot of people.

200
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,541
That way... we can
blend in with a crowd,

201
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,416
and maybe find a way to contact
Tetsuro and the others. You

202
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,041
think it would be
safer there?

203
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:58,041
Yeah, if there's lots of
people around,

204
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,666
then Chronos' agents
probably won't risk

205
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,166
turning into Zoanoids
in the middle of town.

206
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,916
Besides, if we can
blend in with a crowd,

207
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I doubt they'll be
able to find us at all.

208
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,708
You're right.

209
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,958
That was the only idea I
could come up with.

210
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,583
But what should we do now?

211
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:21,500
I guess we should start walking
till we hit a town.

212
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,666
We can figure out everything
else once we get there.

213
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,208
As long as we keep moving, I
think we should be okay.

214
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,125
[MIZUKI] Sounds good.

215
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,291
[BRESNEL]
We have located

216
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:33,583
both Sho Fukamachi
and Mizuki Segawa, Sir.

217
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,083
They are both currently

218
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:38,583
at the 3rd Street shopping
center in downtown Takechiyo.

219
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,416
If they want to
get away from us,

220
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,333
they're going to have to
try harder than that.

221
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,708
Capture them, even if you
have to transform.

222
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,625
But, Sir, are you sure?

223
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,750
[BARCAS] This is an emergency
situation!

224
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,791
In the worst case scenario, we
can just seal off the town.

225
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,666
We can't let the Guyver
get away!

226
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,708
Understood.

227
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,666
What's wrong?

228
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,500
Mizuki...

229
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,333
Run!
[MIZUKI] Wh..What?!

230
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,541
What's going on?

231
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,250

[Bresnel roars]

233
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,041
No way!

234
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,875
[Bresnel growls threateningly]

235
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,333
Damn! I didn't think they would
transform in the middle of town!

236
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,125
[Bresnel roars]

237
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,666
[Bresnel roars &amp; growls]

238
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,000
Oh no!

239
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,083
[Bresnel continues growling]

240
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,583
[SHO] Guyver!

241
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,708
What's wrong?
Did a gas line blow?

242
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,083
[dog barking]

243
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,125
[Bresnel growls in surprise]

244
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,583
[COMMUNICATIONS] He bioboosted!
Sho Fukamachi's recovered, Sir!

245
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,666
He's able to transform into
the Guyver I again!

246
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,000
[ZX-TOLE] Doctor! We can
take care of this.

247
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,416
Just give us the order
to move out.

248
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,791
[BARCAS] No, you'll stand by
and await orders.

249
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,833
Remember, we still have
Aptom to consider.

250
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,083
I think I see a way clear

251
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:25,083
to remedy this situation without
you having to get involved.

252
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,833
[Bresnel roars]

253
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,291
[Bresnel's death rattle]

254
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,541
[second Bresnel roars]

255
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:49,416
What the...
what the hell is that?!

256
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,791
[second Bresnel growls]

257
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,166
Oh please...

258
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,041
I get it.
He's holding back because

259
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,291
he doesn't want any of the
townspeople to get involved.

260
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,291
We'd better come up with
a new plan, fast...

261
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,041
[WOMAN] Honey, there's something
terrible going on out here!

262
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,833
Shouldn't we call the police!

263
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,291
[heavy breathing and slobbering]

264
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,875

Hey, are you listening to me?

[beastial growling]

00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:20,166

Get a hold of yourself!

[Zoanoid transformations

274
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,583
Everyone in this town
is a Zoanoid?

275
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,750
That's terrible...

276

[Zoanoids hissing &amp; growling]

Does your tummy hurt?

Do you need to go to
the doctor, Daddy?

285

Where does it hurt?

00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,416
Can I kiss it and

I can't fight them.

It's all right, I understand.

293
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,791
But now what?

294
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:59,541
[SHO] Right now, all we can do
is try to get out of here.

All right, Mizuki,
hold on tight!

[Zoanoids roar &amp; growl]

298
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:29,666
What's wrong? Why is the
whole town like this?

299
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,833
[SHO] They were probably
captured and converted

300
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,875
into Zoanoids without
even knowing.

301
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,541
A Zoalord must have
used thought waves

302
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,166
to force them to transform.

303
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,583
Now, they have no choice but to
fight to the death.

304
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,083
How could they?

305
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,708
It's just like with your...

306
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,500
[SHO] Yeah, it's just like
what happened to my dad.

307
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,500
I'm sorry...

[Zoanoids growl]

311
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,458
[SHO] Looks like
taking the high ground

312
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,458
is dangerous too.

313
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,083
They have all the
bases covered.

314
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,666
[Zoanoids growling]

315
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,375
[SHO] Hold on just a little
bit longer.

316
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,208
We'll be outside of town in
just a minute, all right?

317
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,916
We should be safe now that we're
away from all the people.

318
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,708
[Gergole laughs arrogantly]

319
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:36,041
We've got you now, Fukamachi!

320
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,916
[Zoanoids growling &amp; hissing]

321
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,958
[SHO] An ambush...

322
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,250
[GERGOLE]
Now, come along with us,

323
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,583
WITHOUT the Guyver
activated of course.

324
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,875
You don't think you
can win do you?

325
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,125
And even if you could,

326
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,833
you'd have to slaughter
every last one of us.

327
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,166
You wouldn't want to kill

328
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,666
all these <i>poor,</i>
<i>innocent</i> townspeople!

329
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,125
[SHO] <i>I... I can't...</i>

330
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,625
What's wrong?

331
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,791
[GERGOLE] Give it up, boy!

332
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:06,916
You can't fight, you can't win
and you can't escape!

333
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,083
[Gregole laughs arrogantly]

334
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,416
[MAKISHIMA] I can't speak
for Fukamachi...

335
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,125
[Gregole continues to laugh...]

336
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,166
[but is cut off in mid-chortle]

337
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,625
...but I'll slaughter every
last one of you.

338
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,083
[RAMOTITH] G..Guyver III?!

339
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,916
[SHO] Makishima!

340
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,458
[MAKISHIMA] Stand back.

341
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,916
[GREGOLE] Retreat!

342
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,791
[SHO] Makishima, no!

343
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,958
[SHO] How could you do
that to them?

344
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,750
[MAKISHIMA] Once Zoanoids
like them transform,

345
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,416
they can't return to
their human bodies.

346
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,291
Those people were trapped
in a living Hell.

347
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,625
I saved them in the
only way I could.

348
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,916
I gave them a quick,
painless death.

349
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:09,208
Don't tell me, after all this,
you were going to let Mizuki

350
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,958
fall into their hands
over some petty sympathy!

351
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,291
[SHO] I... I just...

352
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,291
[MAKISHIMA] We'd better hurry.
If we stay here too long,

353
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,750
they'll send reinforcements.

354
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:25,708
Come on, Segawa and the
others are waiting.

355
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,208
Makishima, wait, you mean
Tetsuro and the others

356
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,583
are all right?

357
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,875
[MAKISHIMA] Don't worry.
Everyone's alive and well.

358
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,041
[SHO] They're all... okay?

359
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,458
[MAKISHIMA] Believe it or not,
we found a place to take refuge.

360
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:39,583
It's only temporary,

361
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,083
but everyone's
waiting for you there.

362
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,500
[SHO] What? Where are they?

363
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:48,708
[MAKISHIMA] (chuckles) I'll tell
you, but you'll be surprised.

364
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,166
They're all inside
Mount Minakami.

365
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,083
On the lowest level, hidden
within Relic's Point.

366
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:31,708
[NARRATOR] Journeying to the
deepest depths of Relic's Point,

367
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:35,625
Mizuki and Sho are finally
reunited with their comrades.

368
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:39,375
Aided by the research associates
of Professor Yamamura,

369
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:42,958
they are offered a temporary
haven from their adversaries.

370
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:45,500
Then, as Guyot makes
an unexpected visit

371
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:46,916
to the bottom floor,

372
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,458
a mysterious power echoes
through the ancient ruins.

373
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:53,958
The Creators' legacy awakens.

374
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,875
Next time: "Vibrations"
