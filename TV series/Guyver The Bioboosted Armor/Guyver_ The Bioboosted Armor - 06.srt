[NOSKOV] H-He reversed
my sonic eraser!

[SHO] Mizuki!

5
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,541
[TETSURO] Let my sister go,
you son of a bitch!

6
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,916
[SHO] Damn it! Come back here!

7
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,583
[NOSKOV] I have taken the girl
and retreated as commanded, Sir.

8
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,416
[NOSKOV] Now please... send
reinforcements!

9
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,791
[Noskov cries out in
surprise and pain]

10
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,125
No... it can't be...

11
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,666
[SHO] Tetsuro! Where's Mizuki?
[MAKISHIMA] Relax.

12
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,958
Your girlfriend is safe.

13
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,833
[SHO] A... Guyver?

14
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,666
Mizuki?

15
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,833
[SHO]
Mizuki!

16
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,333
Hey, are you all right?

17
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:21,000
Where are we?
[SHO] In the hospital.

18
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:24,041
How did I...

19
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,500
It's all thanks to Makishima.

20
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,458
We're lucky he was able to get
you a room like this.

21
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,166
He did that for me?

22
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,250
Are you okay, Mizuki?
You didn't get hurt did you?

23
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,375
That monster... What
WAS that thing?!

24
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,625
[TETSURO]
Monster?

25
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,625
Oh, you're talking about
the film shoot, right?

26
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,958
Film shoot?

27
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,416
Yeah... They were filming
a sci-fi monster show.

28
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,000
I guess you didn't
notice the cameras

29
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,541
and walked right onto the set.

30
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,541
We're lucky they let us sit
around and watch. Right, Sho?

31
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,000
[SHO] R..Right...

32
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,416
So... you mean, that was
just a film shoot?

33
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,791
That's right. Uh... what was the
name of that supposed to be?

34
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,375
I can't remember.

35
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,000
You promise you aren't hiding
something from me?

36
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:08,791
[TETSURO] No way! I mean, what
have we got to hide, right?

37
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,000
Right...

38
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,250
I can always tell when
you're lying to me.

39
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,166
Come on!

40
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,666
Why can't you just
tell me the truth?!

41
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,375
I know that wasn't a film shoot.

42
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,500
That thing was real...

43
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,083
[Noskov roars]

44
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:28,041
What was that? It was
so horrible! No!

45
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,125
[TETSURO] Calm down, Mizuki!

46
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,708
You're just delirious from
the shock, that's all.

47
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,416
There's no such thing as
monsters! Relax...

48
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,000
You're wrong. I FELT it. That
wasn't just some guy in a suit!

49
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,041
I swear! The way that
thing touched me...

50
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,583
You can't make
something like that up!

51
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,625
No more!

52
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,291
[SHO] Mizuki...

53
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,333
Excuse me, I'm afraid visiting
hours are over now.

54
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,500
Oh right...

55
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:09,416
I'm sorry Mizuki.
We need to get going, okay?

56
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,833
[SHO] We'll come back soon.
[Mizuki sobs quietly]

57
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,916
[TETSURO] Let's just go
home for now.

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
[SHO] Yeah...

59
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,875
[MIZUKI] <i>What was it really?</i>
<i>What are they hiding?</i>

60
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,500
[RESEARCHER] As I mentioned,
this experimental enzyme

61
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,333
can bond with a component of the
Guyver's outer shell

62
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,625
and effectively dissolve its
protective layer.

63
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,708
Therefore, if you can apply
the enzyme to the Guyver,

64
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,750
you can break down its defenses
and inflict critical damage.

65
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,375
[GUYOT]
Indeed.

66
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,208
However, if it comes in
contact with the air,

67
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,750
a chemical reaction will occur

68
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,125
and it will instantly lose
all of its potency.

69
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,541
Because of that, it won't
be possible

70
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,916
to discharge the solution like
Zerbebuth's acid attack.

71
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,791
Instead, it has
secreting glands.

72
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,583
Some in the fangs,
some on its claws,

73
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,083
and at the very tip of its tail.

74
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,166
If any of those parts
can inject the enzyme

75
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,208
into the Guyver's body, it
should prove quite effective.

76
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:14,041
And how long will the
optimizations take?

77
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,041
They should be finished
momentarily, but...

78
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,500
I'm concerned, Sir.

79
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,166
Oh? About what?

80
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,625
Well, it's just that
we haven't had time

81
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,291
to properly test the specimen.

82
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,458
No matter. It's nothing
but a prototype.

83
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,041
I don't anticipate that it
will be capable of defeating

84
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,916
both the Guyvers on its own.
If it can manage to take out

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
even one of the two units,
that will be more than enough.

86
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,541
Wouldn't you agree... Agito?

87
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:45,125
Absolutely, Sir. I
couldn't agree more.

88
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,833
Not even an ounce of
sympathy, huh?

89
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,833
Not so much as a flinch as the
man you once called your father

90
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,458
is given his death sentence?

91
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:56,416
That's right. We never DID have
much affection for each other.

92
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:01,250
[MAKISHIMA] My only purpose was
to help fortify his position.

93
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,958
He secretly drove my father's
company to bankruptcy,

94
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,166
then took me as payment in
return for taking care of

95
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,291
my family's enormous debt.

96
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,833
I've only ever
been a tool to him.

97
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,791
A highly proficient,
ruthless pawn

98
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,291
raised only to
serve its master.

99
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,000
And you can see where that's
gotten him, can't you?

100
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:24,083
[GUYOT] So what of the boy
with the Guyver unit?

101
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,458
[MAKISHIMA]
I've let him go for now,

102
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,291
but I can make other
arrangements if you wish.

Uh, no, it's nothing.

[TETSURO] Sho! You
can't fool me.

111
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,916
I know what you're thinking
and I don't like it one bit.

Don't do this alone.

113
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,333
Forget it! Just go away!

114

The last thing I need
at a time like this

118
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,833
is you and Mizuki
weighing me down!

Yes... Come in!

How are you feeling?

I'm fine, I'm just sorry to have
put you through so much trouble.

You didn't have to
do all this.

Don't worry about it.

My father's the director here,
so it was no trouble at all.

You just relax and
get some rest.

rest up tonight,

you should be able
to go home tomorrow.

00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,750
<i>I guess I got</i>
<i>what I asked for.</i>

157
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,000
[TETSURO] Hey...
[SHO] What are you doing here?

158
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,458
I tried going back home,
but I was too worried.

159
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,041
I don't think this
is any time for you

160
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,916
to be worrying about me!

161
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,333
That's true. Look, just let me
give this to you straight.

162
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:32,166
Honestly, when I'm alone, I get
so scared I can't stand it.

163
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,416
It's like I'm going insane.
[SHO] Tetsuro...

164
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,583
But it's a different story
when I'm around you.

165
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,041
No matter how bad things get

166
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,875
we can at least try to
work them out together.

167
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,125
But still... as long
as you're with me,

168
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,958
your life is gonna be at risk.

169
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,750
I got us into this mess.

170
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,750
That... that's not true...

171
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,125
No, back then,

172
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,166
if I hadn't been so interested
in that Guyver unit,

173
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,833
then none of this would have
happened to you.

174
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:01,083
No matter how much I apologize,
or how much I regret it,

175
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,708
it can never be enough.

176
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,291
Please, don't say things
like that.

177
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,708
Come on, Sho. Two heads are
better than one, right?

178
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,500
Why don't we try taking
this on together?

179
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,625
[SHO]
Tetsuro!

180
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,250
[TETSURO] I mean it. Please let
me do something! Anything!

181
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,125
Tetsuro, please look at
me for a second.

182
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,750
Let me be straight
with you too.

183
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,291
It's true... when I say I
don't want you and Mizuki

184
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,958
to get involved
in all this mess,

185
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,458
I really mean it. But that
doesn't mean I'm not afraid.

186
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,583
I don't want to be alone.

187
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:42,666
But now that I see your face...
I feel like I can do it.

188
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,625
You've already done all you
need to do to help me.

189
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,083
So, please just leave
this to me for right now.

190
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,625
I promise I'll come
back alive. All right...

191
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,375
Wait! Chronos is
calling you out.

192
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,166
That's what this is about.

193
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,666
That thing you hid in your
pocket a second ago,

194
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,208
that's a note from
them, isn't it?

195
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:06,000
[SHO] I ll be okay. I'm gonna
fight them with all I've got.

196
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,291
I won't lose.

197
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:10,083
Gimme a break! Stop trying
to act so tough!

198
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,333
[SHO]
It's not about being tough.

199
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,166
It's about putting
an end to this.

200
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,125
I have to do this by myself!

201
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,208
I'm the only one who
can win this fight!

202
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:21,500
No way! Those guys
are too dangerous!

203
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,833
And that's exactly why
you can't come!

204
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,000
But you're walking right
into their trap!

205
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:29,458
It doesn't matter.
I KNOW I can do this.

206
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,875
Well, I'd sure like to know

207
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,083
where you got this confidence
from all of a sudden!

208
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,708
I'm confident because I'm too
important to them. That's why.

209
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,333
They won't kill me because
I'm the Guyver.

210
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,541
And what guarantee do you
have of that, huh?

211
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:48,083
I'll be fine. They need me. No
matter what, I WON'T die!

212
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,541
It's too risky!

213
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,625
[SHO] It doesn't matter
how risky it is.

214
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,916
Right now, I don't have
any other options.

215
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That much I'm sure of.

216
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,625
I have to fight, and
I have to win!

217
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,750
So you're going no matter what?

218
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:06,458
Yes. And nothing you can say
will change my mind.

219
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,166
[TETSURO] Then I'm coming too.

220
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,166
What happens if you get killed?!

221
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,958
You're going to win.
You said it yourself.

222
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,208
You shouldn't mind as long
as I watch from the sidelines

223
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,000
and stay out of your way, right?

224
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,166
Now that I think about it,
ever since we were kids,

225
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,125
you never could win an argument
with me, could ya?

226
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,958
You've always been a bit
too straightforward.

227
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,750
[SHO] You're really
messed up, you know that?

228
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:33,208
Whatever. All right, let's
just take care of those jerks

229
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,791
and get back home.
For Mizuki's sake.

230
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,250
[TETSURO] She's probably
still pretty shaken up

231
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,208
about what happened yesterday.

232
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,875
I've got to go check up
on her again, okay?

233
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,458
Yeah, you're right.

234
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:52,625
[water gurgling and draining]
[buzzer sounds]

235
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,750
Optimizations complete, Sir.

236
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:11,375
Now, Enzyme, show us the power
of an anti-Guyver Zoanoid!

237
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,583
I order you to take back the
Guyver's control metal!

238
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,708
[Enzyme growls]

239
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,708
[TETSURO] This is it.
This is definitely the place.

240
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:43,166
I guess this is where it
all started, huh?

241
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,916
I keep wishing this was some
kind of bad dream,

242
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,583
but I guess there's no running
away from reality, huh?

243
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,125
We'll put an end to this.

244
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,583
Then everything will finally
be back to how it was before.

245
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:56,166
Right, and we're
going back together.

246
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,250
Yeah...

247
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,750
[TETSURO] I wonder what
exploded here anyway?

248
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,333
[GENZO] It was a hand grenade.

249
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,083
One of the test subjects escaped
from our research facility

250
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,250
and ran off with
the Guyver unit.

251
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,416
This is where he decided
to end his life.

252
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,833
Hmm? I see you were the ones
who picked up the Guyver unit

253
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,625
after the explosion.

254
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:18,916
Yeah, who are you?

255
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,583
[GENZO]
Director of Chronos Japan.

256
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,583
Director? The Japanese branch?!

257
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,875
Well, that's what I was until
yesterday at least.

258
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,000
Thanks to you two, I was held
responsible for the lost unit.

259
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:36,375
And now I'm enhanced with
an anti-Guyver enzyme...

260
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,666
And now, I only live
for your death!

261
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,958
[Enzyme roars]

262
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,875
[Tetsuro screams]

263
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,375
Stand back Tetsuro, I'm
gonna transform.

264
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,750
Guyver!

265
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,750
[Enzyme roars]

266
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,333

[Enzyme screams in pain]

269
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:18,416
[ENZYME] You bastard, I've lost
everything because of you!

270
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,750
All my honor! All my influence!

271
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:24,166
I'll make you suffer for
what you did to me!

272
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,833
Holy crap! I can't believe
he's still standing

273
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,625
after that last shot!

274
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,125
How impressive.

275
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,416
He's performing far
beyond expectation,

276
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,625
as if he's being fueled
by hatred and rage.

277
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,333
[ENZYME] I'll tear you to
pieces, you brat!

[SHO]

<i>I'll beat him and put</i>
<i>an end to this nightmare!</i>

280
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,166
[ENZYME] I'll kill you!

281
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,583
[Enzyme roars]
[Sho screams in pain]

282
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:56,541
Now, Enzyme! Tear into his armor
and finish him off!

283
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,208
[ENZYME] I'll make you suffer!

284
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,833
[Sho screams in pain]

285
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,416
Sho!

00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,375
<i>It's like his claws melted</i>
<i>right through my armor!</i>

289
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,416
[ENZYME] Just try to use
your mega-smasher!

290
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,875
I won't be satisfied until

291
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,208
you've suffered as
much as I have!

292
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:22,875
I'll show you the
true meaning of Hell!

[ENZYME] Die! DIE, Guyver!

298
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,333
You're finished!

299
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,500
[SHO] <i>This is it...</i>

300

<i>No... I won't die! I'm going</i>

00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,750
currently spread around
the recovery point.

309
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,041
Stay there and await orders.

310
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,625
[SHO] <i>All right, my left</i>
<i>side is good to go.</i>

311
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,875
[Enzyme roars]

312
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:49,500
[Sho screams in pain]
[Enzyme laughs triumphantly]

313
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,708
[SHO] <i>Now's my chance...</i>
Take this!

314
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,000
[Enzyme grunts in pain]

315
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,291
[SHO] You bastard!

316
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,666
[Enzyme roars]

317
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,500
[Sho screams in pain]
[TETSURO] Sho!

318
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,166
[Enzyme roars triumphantly]

319
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,916
[Sho groans in pain]

320
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,875
[Enzyme laughs menacingly]

321
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:14,625
Yes! Good work, Enzyme! Now
tear out his control metal

322
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,583
and you'll have your revenge!

323
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,541
[Enzyme growls]

324
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,541
[Enzyme roars]

325
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:30,208
[SHO] <i>I can't lose...</i>
<i>I promised Tetsuro...</i>

326
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,583
[Enzyme growls]

327
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:37,208
Stop it! Stop!

328
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,750
All right, close in and recover
the control metal!

329
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,875
[Sho groans quietly]

330
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,750
The control metal is now
in our possession, Sir.

331
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,333
[Sho growls]

332
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:04,083
C-Commander! The Guyver! It's--
[Sho roars]

333
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:08,458
<i>Enzyme, you've outlived your</i>
<i>usefulness. Destruct!</i>

334
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,708
[Enzyme roars]

335
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:21,208
Sho... SHO!

336
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,708
He's dead...

337
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:29,791
[SOLDIER]
The Guyver and Enzyme

338
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,750
have both been
completely obliterated.

339
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,916
All units will now
return to base.

340
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,875
No way... This can't be...

341
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,666
[MAKISHIMA] Now all the
pieces are in place.

342
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:32,041
[NARRATOR] Thrown into a reality
that he cannot accept,

343
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:35,833
Tetsuro finds himself in the
clutches of Chronos.

344
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,750
Powerless, he gazes on as
a cruel man filled with

345
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:42,125
contempt for humanity
reveals the horrific details

346
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:45,416
of his plan for global
transformation.

347
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,583
An enhanced Zerbebuth designed
to hunt down the Guyver

348
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:52,458
appears before Risker and is
met with a cold gaze.

349
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,458
Next time:
"Miraculous Cell"
