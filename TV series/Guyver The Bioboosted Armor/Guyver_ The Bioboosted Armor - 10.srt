1
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,333
[SHO] Tetsuro...
Our town, it's...

2
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:11,375
Yeah...

3
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,000
[gasps]

4
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,208
Wh-What's wrong, Tetsuro?

5
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,958
It's Mizuki!

6
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,375
[GUYOT] It would seem that
Panadyne has failed us.

7
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,625
[MAKISHIMA] Should we send in
more Zoanoids to handle this?

8
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:47,125
Or perhaps this situation calls
for the Lost Numbers.

9
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:51,583
[GUYOT] Hmmm... That's an
interesting proposal.

10
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,041
It's difficult.

11
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,250
If we continue to haphazardly

12
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,416
toss out Zoanoids as
we've been doing,

13
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,875
we'll only be wasting
our resources.

14
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:06,041
I agree. The Guyver's combat
abilities seem great enough

15
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,833
to decimate an entire
legion of Zoanoids.

16
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:12,166
Even all the Zoanoids in Japan
might not prove to be enough.

17
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,833
Well, what can I say?

18
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,083
It's a powerful weapon.

19
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,208
It's turned a mere child into
a virtual killing machine.

20
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,750
Remarkable, isn't it?

21
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,333
He's had no military training
or prior combat experience,

22
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,875
and yet he can
surpass some of our

23
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,625
most formidable
hyper-Zoanoids.

24
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,958
[laughs]

25
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,208
However, one thing still
bothers me.

26
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,583
That Sho boy, I can't get
inside his head.

27
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:45,083
Agito, I'd like to hear your
opinion on the issue.

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,333
Why does he do it?

29
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:52,583
Why does he insist on
defying us at every turn?

30
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,291
Be as candid as you like.

31
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,291
After all, the two of you
are friends, aren't you?

32
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:01,625
Well... It must be his
emotional makeup.

33
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,250
For example, he shows a
very powerful attachment

34
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,166
towards daily life.

35
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,291
Daily life?
I don't quite understand.

36
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,458
Actually, I believe you
said it best yourself.

37
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:16,666
Sho Fukamachi is a "mere child."
He's just a nobody.

38
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,000
His unextraordinary nature is
precisely why he clings to that

39
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,833
which ordinary people cherish.

40
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,041
Things like a peaceful,
mundane life shared

41
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,875
with friends and family.

42
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,041
When we of Chronos threaten
that sheltered existence,

43
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,750
he bares his fangs,
and lashes out.

44
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:34,041
How very human of him.
It's human to a fault.

45
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,791
Agito, I want you to
round up everyone

46
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,750
who has anything to do
with the Guyver I.

47
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,291
We're going to do everything
possible to utterly destroy

48
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,708
this "everyday life" he clings
so desperately to!

49
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,875
[MAKISHIMA] Yes, Sir.

50
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:05,208
[cars passing,
sirens in the distance]

51
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,458
[Recording]
We're sorry,

52
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,250
but the cellular caller
you are trying to reach

53
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,833
is either unavailable or outside

54
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,125
of the service
area at this time.

55
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,916
Sho...

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,875
[MAKISHIMA]
Your target is Fumio Fukamachi.

57
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:21,625
Age 47, father of Sho Fukamachi.

58
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,125
It's assumed that the Guyver I

59
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,375
will attempt to interfere
with this mission.

60
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,833
That's right, you should avoid
engagement at all costs.

61
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,291
[MAKISHIMA]
It is of the utmost importance

62
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,333
that Fumio Fukamachi
be taken unharmed.

63
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,750
Understood?

64
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,000
<i>[MAKISHIMA] This is all coming</i>

<i>I'm taking him out!</i>

70
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,083
[MAKISHIMA] Your time is up
Richard Guyot. Prepare to die.

71
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:08,166
What the hell? Guyver III?

<i>without even noticing?!</i>
[APTOM] Something's wrong...

76
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,291
Commander Guyot! I've been
here with him all night,

77
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,583
and I assure you Dyme
hasn't let anyone inside.

78
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,625
[GUYOT] What?!

93
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,375
Guyot! I'll let
you live for now,

94
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,500
but you haven't seen
the last of me!

95
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:21,166
Get back here!
Where'd he go?

96
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,833
[MAKISHIMA] What's going on?

97
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,666
[SOMLUM] Master Agito!
We were just attacked!

98

You all right?

We can't let him escape!

No, don't bother.

It's fine.

[TETSURO] Hello? Ah, yes,
Sir, he's just fine.

106
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,125
Yeah, he's right here with me.

107
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,166
Sure. I'll put him on.
Hold on a sec.

108
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,541
Sho, it's your dad.

Hello, Dad? It's me.

110

[FUMIO] Oh, Sho, thank God
you're okay.

111
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,625
I was worried about you.
Nothing bad happened, did it?

112
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,833
Well, I, uh...

113
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,083
I got worried 'cause

114
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,625
I couldn't get a hold of
you on your cell phone.

115
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,166
I'm sure glad you're all right.

What? Sho, you're starting
to break up.

119

It's a weak signal or something.

120

Well, anyway I'm just glad to
hear that you're safe.

We will proceed to contain him.

waiting at the bus stop

[SHO] Hello? Dad?

doing? No, stop! Stay a...

Hello?!

I'll be right back.

00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,375

You promised, remember?

138
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:35,333
You said when the time was
right, you'd tell me everything.

139
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,500
Yeah...

140
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,916
Tetsuro, I think I
deserve to know.

141
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,708
Yeah, you're right.

Where are you taking me?

147

Let go of me right now!

148

[SHO] Dad!
That way!

149
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,375
[MAKISHIMA] What? You think that
whoever has the Guyver III

150
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,166
is a member of Chronos that's
targeting us from the inside?

151
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,541
[GUYOT] Well, if it's so, then
it'd explain how he appeared

152
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,041
at the Japanese headquarters

153
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,083
and activated the
self-destruct code.

154
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,333
The answer seems obvious,
don't you think?

155
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,875
[MAKISHIMA]
It certainly does.

156
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,416
Commander, it's too
dangerous here.

157
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,833
For now I believe
it would be best

158
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,166
if you came along with us
back to Relic's Point.

159
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,083
Really? You think?

160
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,833
Our encounter today should
have made it painfully clear

161
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,833
that he's the one in danger.

162
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,666
Right now, I'm sure that
he's aware that his betrayal

163
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,208
may result in deadly
consequences. Right?

164
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,250
<i>[MAKISHIMA] At this point,</i>
<i>there's no doubt in my mind</i>

165
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,833
<i>that Guyot suspects me</i>
<i>as the Guyver III.</i>

166
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,000
<i>But what is he getting at?</i>

167
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:15,541
<i>What's the point of this farce?</i>

168
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,708
But why not pursue him? Even if
he is aware of your power,

169
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,916
isn't it too great of a risk to
allow him to go free like this?

170
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,375
Judging by his previous actions,

171
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:28,041
he'll likely stop at nothing,
Commander, to kill you.

172
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,375
[GUYOT]
I'd like to see him try.

173
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,375
If that fool's willing
to go all out against us,

174
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,500
we'll make him regret it.

175
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:38,000
But for now, let's just sit back
and watch the show, shall we?

176
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,666
[phone rings]

177
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,333
Excuse me... Hello?

178
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,875
[SQUAD LEADER] This is Team
Bravo. We need reinforcements.

179
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,208
Now!
[tires squealing]

180
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,541
[MAKASHIMA] What's going on?!

181
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,750
[SQUAD LEADER] We're being
pursued by the Guyver I!

182
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,333
Requesting reinforcements
as soon as possible!

183
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,541
At this rate, we'll all be ki...
[screams]

184
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,500
That was the unit I dispatched
to capture Fumio Fukamachi.

185
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,291
They're being assaulted
by the Guyver I,

186
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:08,500
so I highly doubt they'll be
able to hold out much longer.

187
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,041
I don't suppose that should
come as much of a surprise,

188
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:11,875
should it?

189
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,083
I'll take a team of Zoanoids

190
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,500
and head to the
scene right away.

191
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,250
[APTOM] Just a moment, Sir.
With all due respect...

192
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,666
you're still only a humanoid,
Master Agito.

193
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,958
If we send you with a team of
Japanese Branch Zoanoids,

194
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,666
the results won't be good.

195
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,000
Commander, we're far better
suited to deal with the Guyver.

196
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,833
Why don't you let us
handle this instead?

197
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,666
Very well, feel free
to show the Guyver I

198
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,333
the full power of the
Lost Number Commandos.

199
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,083
Sir!

200
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,166
Agito, proceed with the plan to
destroy Fukamachi's way of life.

201
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,916
Do whatever you can
to break him down.

202
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,625
Sir.

203
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,166
[MIZUKI]
So that's how it is, huh?

204
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,041
You're surprised, aren't you?

205
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,666
Of course I'm surprised.
[TETSURO] I, uh...

206
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,708
I mean, I'm surprised, but...

207
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,541
This situation is
pretty extreme.

208
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:13,000
The truth is, I'm really just
feeling sort of overwhelmed.

209
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,541
You know?

210
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,458
[TETSURO] Overwhelmed?
Is that all?

211
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,291
What's wrong with that?

212
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,666
Just because I'm
not freaking out

213
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,875
doesn't mean I'm not worried.

214
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,666
Sorry.
[MIZUKI] Tetsuro...

215
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,041
I wish you would have told
me all this sooner.

216
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,041
Sho's been risking his
life to protect us,

217
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,541
and I didn't even know!

218
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,375
Yeah...

219
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:35,666
It's just...
The thing is...

220
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,041
Sho didn't want you to find out.

221
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,208
More than anybody else,

222
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:44,291
he didn't want you to
know about him.

223
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,791
[TETSURO] Well, you know,

224
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,083
he's got a pretty
big crush on you.

225
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,875
And I don't wanna hear you tell
me you didn't know either!

226
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,333
I never saw him like that.

227
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,208
I mean, we've been
friends for so long,

228
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,625
I never even thought about it.

229
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,875
I know it's a bad time,

230
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,541
but I wanted you to have
at least some idea

231
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,250
of how Sho felt too.

232
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,416
Take them away.

233
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,750
[APTOM] There he is.

234
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:34,625
Are you two sure? I hope we're
not making a big mistake.

235
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,583
I can't... take it.
[screams]

236
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,375
The heat... the pain...

237
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:46,041
No! No more experiments!

238
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,583
[Somlum screams]

239
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:51,875
He's right. I don't think we can
take this crap much longer.

240
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,458
I've had enough of them
screwing around with me

241
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:57,791
day in and day out, like I'm
some kind of lab rat. It's sick.

242
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,083
[Aptom screams]

243
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,708
All of this because our
optimizations failed.

244
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,166
We have to suffer because they
made us into freaks of nature

245
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,166
and can't replicate our forms.

246
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,541
Those bastards have never
given us the same treatment

247
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:13,750
as other Zoanoids.

248
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,541
There's no guarantee
that we'll survive

249
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,750
the fight with the Guyver.

250
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,583
Are you both prepared for that?

251
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:23,416
We're willing to take
that risk. Right?

252
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,125
[APTOM] This is our chance.
If we can defeat the Guyver,

253
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,458
then Commander Guyot will
recognize our abilities.

254
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,458
We'll finally get the respect we
deserve. Then finally,

255
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,875
we'll be able to leave all of
this pain and disgrace behind!

256
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,625
Let's do this.

257
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,833
[transformation growls]

258
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,833
[SHO] <i>Damn it! I don't know</i>
<i>how to handle this.</i>

259
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,916
<i>If I take out the driver,</i>
<i>I might end up hurting Dad.</i>

260
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,958
[SHO] What's going on?

261
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,541
[DYME] [chuckles] I gotcha.

262
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,666
[SHO] Is this another kind
of Zoanoid?

263
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,875
[APTOM] Surprised?
By liquefying his body,

264
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,375
he can combine with
the earth around him

265
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,791
and manipulate the battlefield

266
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,208
to give his allies a
decisive edge in combat.

267
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,833
Only Dyme is capable
of such power!

268
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,083
[SHO] What?!

269
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,041
Now you're facing the
Lost Numbers, Guyver.

270
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,916
It's a whole new game.

271
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,416
[SHO] It can't be!

272
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,333
Another Guyver?!

273
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:45,500
[SHO] <i>So that means...</i>
<i>there were four?</i>

274
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:49,291
[APTOM] Not a bad likeness,
don't you think, Guyver I?

275
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,500
[MURAKAMI] <i>Two Guyvers are</i>
<i>fighting each other?</i>

276
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,833
[APTOM] I think I know just
what to do with you.

277
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,125
I'm gonna let you see what
it feels like to be torn apart

278
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,666
by your high
frequency arm blades.

279
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,458
Just like all the Zoanoids
you've murdered!

280
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,625
DIE!

281
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,166
[Murakami gasps]

282
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,375
[APTOM] Shit! Somlum!

283
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:17,541
[SHO] Wh..What is this stuff?
I can't move my arms!

284
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,541
[SOMLUM] As you can see,
my saliva bonds

285
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,500
and assimilates with
organic tissue.

286
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,583
Once it hardens
and forms itself,

287
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,291
you won't be able
to move at all!

288
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,750
It's no use, give it up, kid!

289
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,708
By this point, that stuff might
as well be part of your body.

290
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,333
If you keep
struggling like that,

291
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,125
you're going to rip
your own arms off!

292
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,916
You get it?
[Sho] Damn it...

293
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,666
What'll I do now?

294
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,875
[DYME] This is our fight.
I won't allow you to interfere.

295
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,083
[Aptom laughs]

296
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,208
[APTOM] Let's see you get out
of this one, Guyver I.

297
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,625
Easy now. Let's not do anything
rash. Someone might get hurt.

298
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,125
[Murakami screams]

299
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,375
[APTOM] At my command, Dyme
can crush your little friend

300
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,208
to pieces and dissolve
his bones to dust!

301
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,208
[SHO] Cowards!

302
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,125
[APTOM] Call us
whatever you want!

303
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,250
[MURAKAMI]
<i>No good. I've gotta think.</i>

304
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,125
[APTOM] Let's see, how about I
take off that head of yours?

305
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,541
[laughs]

306
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,666
Guyver, listen up!
Don't let him intimidate you!

307
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,708
I don't care how
powerful Chronos is

308
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,583
they still can't control
the bio armor!

309
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,375
He may look like a Guyver, and
he may have the same weapons,

310
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,041
but he's nothing but
a cheap imitation!

311
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:33,416
[SHO] <i>He's right! He doesn't</i>
<i>have</i> the control metal!

312
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,875
<i>Now I get it. They tried</i>
<i>to disable my attacks,</i>

313
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,583
<i>because they're</i>
<i>afraid I'm stronger.</i>

314
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,041
[APTOM] So you finally figured
it out, huh?

315
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,250
Well, I hate to break it to you,

316
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,291
but it doesn't matter if
I'm a Guyver or not!

317
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,250
With Somlum and Dyme
disarming your weapons,

318
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,833
you're no match for us at all!!

319
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,750
[MURAKAMI] <i>I have no choice...</i>

320
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,833
[GUYOT'S VOICE] <i>Dyme!</i>

321
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,416
<i>Release them, immediately!</i>

322
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,583
[DYME] Commander Guyot?

323
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,958
[GUYOT'S VOICE] <i>Release them!</i>

324
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,166
[APTOM] Now die!

325
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,625
What?!

326
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,125
[APTOM] Dyme! What happened?!

327
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,833
What, are you gonna tear the
flesh off your own arms?

328
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,708
You're a bigger fool
than I thought!

329
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,708
[SHO] I have to...
If I'm...

330
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:23,625
If I'm defeated here, then who's
gonna save my father?!

331
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,875
[Sho strains &amp; moans]

332
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:35,083
[SHO] I can't give up!
Because, if I lose to you...

333
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,500
Then who's gonna protect
my friends?!

334
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,458
[growls]

335
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,250
[SHO] You don't understand.

336
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,958
This is all I have!

337
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,250
My fight is a fight I can't
afford to lose!

338
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,166
[SOMLUM] Aptom!

339
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,958
[Somlum roars in death]

340
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,666
[APTOM] Somlum!

341
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,083
Dyme! You idiot! Why the hell
did you let them go?!

342
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,666
[DYME] No, w..wait!
This is all wrong!

343
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,958
I was... [screams]

344
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,458
[APTOM] Dyme!

345
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,708
Dyme, no!

346
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:30,541
You son of a bitch!
I'll kill you! [yells]

347
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,375
Damn it...

348
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,416
[GUYOT]
<i>We have secured Fumio Fukamachi</i>

349
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,041
<i>and the Segawa siblings.</i>

350
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,708
<i>The operation is a success.</i>
<i>Withdraw immediately.</i>

351
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,833
[APTOM] But, Commander!
I can't turn my back now,

352
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:50,791
after he's slaughtered my...

353
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,791
[GUYOT] <i>I said withdraw!</i>

354
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:56,666
[APTOM] <i>Somlum... Dyme...</i>
<i>Forgive me.</i>

355
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,375
<i>This isn't over yet.</i>

356
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:02,583
<i>I swear... I swear I'll</i>
<i>avenge you, no matter what!</i>

357
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,041
[APTOM] You may have
defeated my men,

358
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,041
but you fell right
into our trap!

359
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,083
We've captured your father
and the Segawas.

360
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,000
So our mission was a
success in spite of you!

361
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,416
[SHO] What did you say?

362
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,250
[SHO] <i>So it wasn't just Dad,</i>

363
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,750
<i>those bastards went after</i>
<i>Mizuki and Tetsuro too?!</i>

364
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,000
[SHO] Damn it!

365
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,041
Dad...
Tetsuro...

366
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,500
Mizuki...

367
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:35,958
Now they're all gonna die!
This is all my fault!

368
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,666
If I had known it would
turn out like this,

369
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,833
I wouldn't have taken it this
far! I should have given up!

370
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,916
After all this, is that
really how you feel?

371
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:50,833
Come on, Sho. Stand up.

372
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:54,458
[SHO] Who are you?
How do you know my name?

373
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,625
[NARRATOR] Hidden beneath
an age-old mountain,

374
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:34,208
Sho's family and friends
are torn away from him

375
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,750
by Chronos' wicked plans.

376
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,500
As he races to their side,

377
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,250
Makishima bares his fangs at
his father's organization

378
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:46,583
and begins a fierce battle with
five elite hyper-Zoanoids.

379
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,250
Looming in their shadow is

380
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:51,916
a mysterious old man,
grinning strangely.

381
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,166
Next time:
"Relic's Point"
