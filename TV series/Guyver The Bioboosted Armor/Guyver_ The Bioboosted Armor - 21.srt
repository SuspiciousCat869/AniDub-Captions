1
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,583
[BLOCK B] This is Block B.

2
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,041
We have confirmed a massive
explosion in the vacinity.

3
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,875
Fires are spreading
throughout the block.

4
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,916
[CONTROL] Understood. Lock down
the damaged sectors immediately!

5
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,250
Activate the confinment walls!

6
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,708
[soldier screams]

7
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,625
[BLOCK B] Commander Guyot!

8
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:25,250
[Guyot breaths menacingly
as he advances]

9
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,458
[BLOCK B] Wh-What are you...

10
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:35,083
[electronic beeping]

11
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:39,041
[Guyot laughs]

12
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,166
[crashing sounds from beyond
shield door growing closer]

13
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,083
[GUYOT] Damn...

14
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,916
[Guyor growls as he
gathers his power]

15
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,458
[ARCHANFEL] This has gone
far enough, Richard.

16
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,791
This rebellion is an
act of futility.

17
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,000
It ends now!

18
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,500
[Guyot roars in defiance]

19
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,708
[CONTROL] Emergency, emergency!
[alarm sirens wailing]

20
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,416
Block B has sustained
serious damage

21
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,125
and has ceased
communication!

22
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,458
[ZX-TOLE]
Where's Commander Guyot?

23
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,708
[CONTROL]
Well, Sir, he's exited Block B

24
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,000
and is currently making his way

25
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,291
through Tunnel 4
towards Block C.

26
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,458
It looks like he's being
pursued by someone,

27
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,291
but we haven't been able to
identify them yet.

28
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,375
[DERZERB]
What the hell's going on here?

29
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,958
Why would the commander
be running away?

30
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,041
[CONTROL] I... I'm sorry, Sir,

31
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,916
but all the monitors the
commander passes are shorted out

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,708
by some kind of interference,

33
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,333
and since losing contact with
all the operatives in the area,

34
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,000
we're in the dark.

35
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,083
Must be a Guyver.

36
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:55,375
I mean, you don't think it
could be Aptom, do you?

37
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,958
Hard to say. The thing is, the
commander's a Zoalord.

38
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,125
I don't think the Guyvers
or Aptom

39
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,958
are strong enough to chase down
someone on his level.

40
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,708
[CONTROL] The commander
has reached Block C!

41
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:10,833
Listen up! Our only objective is
to verify the current situation.

42
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,458
If at all possible,
avoid involvement in the battle

43
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,750
between the commander
and his adversary.

44
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,041
[Guyot roars as he
flies through]

45
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,625
[ARCHANFEL] Come now, Richard.

46
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:32,958
Stop this nonsense and hand
over the Remover.

47
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,500
[Guyot growls angrily]

48
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,875
[GUYOT]
Don't make me repeat myself.

49
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:41,125
I already told you.
The answer is NO!

50
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,000
What a pity.

51
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,250
Run while you still can.

52
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:09,000
You'll soon find obedience
is your only option.

53
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,458
I'm sorry, we lost their signal.

54
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,833
All the Zoanoids at the scene
have been wiped out.

55
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,291
I don't know what's going on!

56
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,166
So, what happened to
Commander Guyot?

57
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,583
From as far as I can tell,

58
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,208
he's broken through the
floor in Block C

59
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,541
and is currently making his
way to the lower levels!

60
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,958
[ZX-TOLE] Derzerb, I want
you to come with me.

61
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,833
We're going to have to look
for Doctor Barcas.

62
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,583
Doctor Barcas?!

63
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,250
We don't know what Commander
Guyot's planning right now.

64
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,666
This situation is getting
out of hand.

65
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,541
At this point, I'm afraid only
a Zoalord can handle this.

66
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,666
Hold on a second,
I'll go with you.

67
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,375
You wait here.
I need you to stay behind

68
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,958
and try to stabilize the
situation with the other units.

69
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,250
But, Sir...
[ZX-TOLE] Think about it.

70
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,458
If the Guyvers or Aptom snuck
into the base right now,

71
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,291
there's no telling how much
damage they could do.

72
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,125
[APTOM] That's a pretty
interesting attack, Gaster!

73
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,458
Next time, I'll have
to absorb you!

74
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,875
[DERZERB]
Probably better this way.

75
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,375
You can't fire off your
missiles inside the base, right?

76
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,791
[GASTER] Right...

77
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,541
We'll meet up with you
later, Gaster.

78
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:27,125
[GASTER]
Aptom sneaking in HERE?

79
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,208
Not likely.

80
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,750
Continue to follow the movements
of Commander Guyot, understand?

81
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,333
[CONTROL] Sir!

82
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,750
While he's doing that, you scan
for the doctor's thought waves.

83
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,375
[OPERATOR] Yes, Sir!

84
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,833
<i>I must hurry.</i>

85
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:57,583
<i>If this Remover is what I</i>
<i>suspect, this could be serious.</i>

86
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:02,250
<i>A power that great should only</i>
<i>rest in Archanfel's hands.</i>

87
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,875
<i>If someone like Guyot were</i>
<i>to aquire it,</i>

88
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,083
<i>it could mean the destruction</i>
<i>of Chronos.</i>

89
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,583
[footsteps in corridor]

90
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:19,666
I see, no survivors.
I... I wonder...

91
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,500
what must've become
of Dr. Barcas?

92
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,541
I hope he survived.

93
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,791
[ZX-TOLE] Derzerb, look out!

94
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:32,500
[Derzerb roars as he transforms]

95
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,791
[DERZERB] Aptom!

96
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:40,041
I didn't think you'd have the
guts to show your face in here!

97
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,333
I've been waiting for this.

98
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:49,541
Now, I can finally send
you to HELL! [roars]

99
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,750
[ZX-Tole] DIE, APTOM!

100
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:07,833
[Aptom screams as he dies]

101
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:13,541
[DERZERB] [disgusted sound]
Man, Look at that.

102
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,666
That sick bastard's still alive.

103
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:22,166
[ZX-TOLE]
Hah! Well, he's dead now.

104
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,541
[DERZERB] That should be the
last we see of him.

105
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,083
Disgusting freak got
what he deserved.

106
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,583
[ZX-TOLE] I'm starting to
think we shouldn't have left

107
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,666
the control room after all.

108
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,458
In fact, that may be the last
thing we should have done.

109
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,750
[DERZERB] Hmm?

110
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,333
[ZX-TOLE]
Come on! We're going back!

111
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,291
[DERZERB] But shouldn't we keep
looking for the doctor?

112
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,333
[ZX-TOLE]
Think about it for a second.

113
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:45,041
Dr. Barcas has the power to
contact us whenever he wants.

114
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,125
It doesn't matter where he is.

115
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,750
If he needs to give us orders,

116
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,375
all he has to do is form a
psychic connection.

117
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,708
[DERZERB]
So, you're saying the doctor

118
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:56,000
would have wanted us to
stay in the control room?

119
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:59,625
[ZX-TOLE] Right, with Aptom
sneaking in as soon as we left,

120
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:03,958
I'm starting to think that
this was a setup.

121
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:07,708
He probably targeted Gaster
after we left the control room.

122
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,333
That's why nobody warned us
before he made his attack.

123
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,250
[gasping and wheezing]

124
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,375
[ZX-TOLE] Gaster?
[GASTER] ...Tole!

125
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:20,333
[DERZERB] Gaster!

126
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:24,166
What's wrong? Hey, hang in
there! What happened, man?

127
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,958
[ZX-TOLE]
Derzeb, that's not Gaster!

128
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:32,083
[Derzerb roars in pain]

129
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,166
[ZX-TOLE] This is insane!

130
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,000
If that was Aptom just now,

131
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,333
then what the hell was that
thing we killed earlier?

132
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,458
Naw, couldn't have been...

133
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,916
[Derzerb groans]
[ZX-TOLE] Are you all right?

134
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,916
[Derzerb breathes heavily
and then roars]

135
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,208
(labored breathing]

136
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,250
[Derzerb roars in pain as
he transforms]

137
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,333
[ZX-TOLE] Derzerb!

138
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,625
No, don't tell me he...

139
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,458
He must have infected Derzerb
when he grabbed his arm!

140
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,125
But that's impossible!
He barely touched him!

141
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:24,125
[Aptom groans, chuckles and
then laughs outloud]

142
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,541
[ZX-TOLE] You bastard,

143
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,916
you killed Gaster the same
way, didn't you?

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,125
[APTOM] That's right, ZX-Tole.
Did you forget already?

145
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,583
The last time we met,

146
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,291
I told you that Gaster was
going to be my next target.

147
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,041
[ZX-TOLE] So, you infiltrated
the command room,

148
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,333
then devoured him while we were
busy fighting with your double.

149
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,250
[APTOM]
Double? Don't be ridiculous.

150
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,583
The Aptom you defeated earlier
was

151
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:49,500
as much myself as the man
standing before you now.

152
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,000
But more than that, I suppose
you could look at it

153
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,000
as a single member of the colony

154
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,958
of bodies united under
my consciousness.

155
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,875
[ZX-TOLE]
What are you talking about?

156
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,708
[APTOM] You still don't get it?

157
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:04,708
I'm saying that each Aptom you
see is another part of my body,

158
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:08,750
acting under my will, the same
as the rest of me.

159
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:12,250
[ZX-TOLE] So, are you saying you
sacrificed half of your own body

160
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,666
only so you could devour
Derzerb and Gaster?!

161
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,583
[APTOM] Sacrifice? I wouldn't
call it a "sacrifice". [laughs]

162
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,416
In fact, you know, I feel
better than ever!

163
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,125
Those friends of yours
really hit the spot.

164
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:29,791
They've more than made up for
the parts I lost fighting you.

165
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,458
[laughs evilly]

166
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,291
[ZX-TOLE] Shut your mouth, you
repulsive bastard!

167
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,958
I won't let you get
away with this!

168
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,916
Even if it costs me my life,

169
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,791
I'll kill you for what
you've done!

170
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,166
He's fast!

171
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,666
Damn it!

172
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,875
[APTOM]
Don't look so surprised ZX-Tole.

173
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,625
It's not like you haven't seen
these attacks before.

174
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:05,625
Remember, I inherited this
power from your old comrades.

175
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,458
[ZX-Tole screams in
pain and rage]

176
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,416
[APTOM]
But there's no need to worry,

177
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,083
I'll feast on your
powers as well!

178
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,875
[ZX-TOLE] What?!

179
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,708
[screams in panic]

180
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:33,125
[ZX-Tole groans in pain]

181
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:37,000
[APTOM] Ah, you're still
alive, huh? Not bad.

182
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,333
But I suppose
should expect as much

183
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:43,375
from the elite
hyper-Zoanoid Five.

184
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,125
Oh, I'm sorry.

185
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,750
I don't suppose I can call you
the "elite five" any more,

186
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:52,416
seeing as there's only one of
you left. [laughs gleefully]

187
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,666
[ZX-TOLE] <i>This is it. At this</i>
<i>rate, I'm as good as dead.</i>

188
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,333
<i>I have no choice.</i>
<i>I'll have to use it after all.</i>

189
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,416
[APTOM] It must be lonely
without your friends.

190
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,458
So what do you say, ZX-Tole?

191
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,708
Why don't you give up this
useless struggle

192
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,083
and become a part of me?

193
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,750
[ZX-TOLE] <i>If I screw this up,</i>
<i>it's all over.</i>

194
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,333
<i>If I use it inside the base,</i>

195
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,250
<i>there's no telling what kind</i>
<i>of damage it will cause.</i>

196
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:20,791
[APTOM]
Elegen, Gaster and Derzerb...

197
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,708
They're calling out to you,
ZX-Tole. Can't you hear them?

198
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:27,666
They're all waiting for you to
join them, inside me.

199
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,166
[ZX-TOLE] <i>It doesn't matter</i>
<i>how risky it is.</i>

200
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,666
<i>If I don't kill him now,</i>

201
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,958
<i>he could bring down</i>
<i>the whole base.</i>

202
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,166
I said, shut your mouth!

203
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,458
I'm sick of your ranting,
you freak!

204
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,291
I already told you...

205
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,750
I won't let you get away
with this,

206
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,833
even if it costs me my life!

207
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,500
[APTOM]
What kind of trick is this?

208
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,458
[wings buzzing]

209
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,208
[APTOM]
The temperature's dropping.

210
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,333
I get it, those glowing
wings of his

211
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:11,666
are absorbing the heat and light
from everything in the area.

212
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,125
I'm impressed, I didn't think
you had that kind of power,

213
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,250
but it's still not enough.

214
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,083
You should know that I can
withstand temperatures

215
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,583
much lower than this.

216
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,291
No, that's not it.

217
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,250
He's not trying to freeze me.

218
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,791
He's absorbing the heat and
light to turn it into energy!

219
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:35,000
[ZX-TOLE]
See you in Hell, Aptom!

220
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,125
[Aptom screams]

221
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,791
<i>Now what's going on?</i>

222
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,458
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

223
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,958
<i>Is this part of Richard's</i>
<i>plan, too?</i>

224
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,916
[sounds of destruction continue]

225
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,375
[ODAGIRI]
So, how do things look, Sho?

226
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,791
Now that you've made contact
with the control center,

227
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,541
do you think you can move the
Relic

228
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,375
and thus bring down the base?

229
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,958
[SHO]
I should be able to pull it off.

230
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,875
There's one problem though.

231
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,958
Even if the ship's operational,

232
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,250
it's been dormant for so long,

233
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,458
I don't think it has enough
energy to fly yet.

234
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,125
So then?

235
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,750
[SHO] Don't worry, I think
it'll be okay.

236
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,333
It's low on power now,

237
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,958
but it looks like it's sucking
energy

238
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,250
from some underground
heat source.

239
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,541
Underground heat source?

240
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,875
[SHO]
Yeah, I'm not sure what it is,

241
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,583
but I'm sensing a large heat
source

242
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,000
about 4 kilometers
down from here.

243
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,125
Must be a magma pool!

244
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,000
[SHO] That's probably how the
Relic has stayed active

245
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,625
for all these years.

246
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:50,166
It must draw up energy from the
magma automatically.

247
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,541
He's quite right.
It's moving slowly,

248
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,875
but the energy from the magma

249
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,208
is definitely making its
way up to the Relic.

250
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,416
Sho, at the current rate,

251
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,166
how long do you think it'll
take for the ship

252
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,916
to replenish its energy stores?

253
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,541
[SHO] If you just need the ship
to take off,

254
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,333
it shouldn't take more
than an hour or so.

255
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,416
In any case, I'll see if I
can speed things up.

256
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,583
The Relic must be causing
these earthquakes.

257
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,958
When it siphons energy
from the magma pool,

258
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,750
it shakes the foundation
of the base.

259
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,958
That's bad, even as is,

260
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,916
the structure of this place is
naturally weakened

261
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,500
by the Relic's biowaves.

262
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,333
With an earthquake,
we might be buried alive.

263
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,708
[RESEARCHER] Doctor,
I've got some bad news.

264
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,416
A communiqué just came through

265
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,333
reporting a series of massive
explosions in blocks C and J.

266
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,666
What?!

267
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,208
[RESEARCHER] I don't have the
full details yet,

268
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,000
but a section of the elevator
shaft was seriously damaged

269
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,416
by one of the explosions.

270
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,583
From the looks of things,

271
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,416
most of the elevators have
stopped working.

272
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,125
[ODAGIRI] So, unless they get
the elevators working again,

273
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:50,625
we're stuck here on
the lowest floor.

274
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,958
Wait a second,

275
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,666
what if we put the Relic's
energy transfer on hold?

276
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,208
[ODAGIRI] It's too late.
We don't have any time.

277
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,708
I don't know what's happening
on the higher levels,

278
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,166
but by this point, I'm sure that
Guyot and Barcas have noticed

279
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,916
the intensified bio waves
coming from the Relic.

280
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,458
If we stall, they'll
find us out.

281
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,666
[SHO] Dr. Odagiri...
[ODAGIRI] Yes?

282
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,333
[SHO] There's one place I know
will be safe

283
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,375
from the earthquakes.

284
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,583
What do you mean, Sho?
Just say it.

285
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,750
Wait... No way, you mean...

286
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,666
[SHO] The Relic...

287
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,250
Here, inside the ship.

288
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,750
[APTOM] What incredible power!

289
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:40,041
Maybe even stronger than
the mega-smasher.

290
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,875
[gtunts with effort]

291
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:47,083
But surely, after an attack
like that,

292
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,750
he must be completely drained.

293
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:54,250
[ZX-TOLE] [panting] Looks like
you managed to survive.

294
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,625
That blast took a lot out of me,

295
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,416
but don't worry,

296
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,833
I still have enough energy
to finish you off!

297
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,083
This is the end, Aptom.
The END!

298
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:10,500
[Aptom groans,
then begins to laugh]

299
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,833
[ZX-TOLE]
Have you lost your mind?

300
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:17,125
[Aptom continues to laugh]

301
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,583
[ZX-TOLE] Huh? What the...

302
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:25,583
Impossible! You mean there
was another one?!

303
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,000
[APTOM] Lucky for me, I happened
to come across the corpses

304
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,291
of three Chronos soldiers
on the way here.

305
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,958
I split into three parts,

306
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,583
using each of their bodies
as another form.

307
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:42,041
And now, I'll have your
body too, ZX-Tole!

308
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,583
[ZX-TOLE] I don't think so!

309
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,875
Crazy bastard blew his own
leg off to get away.

310
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,125
[APTOM] It's all right,

311
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,583
he left behind a tissue sample
for us to use.

312
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,291
[Aptom roars in pain]

313
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,208
[APTOM] I'm sensing a large
concentration of power

314
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,541
originating from somewhere
below.

315
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,791
I can feel it! It's him!
What's going on here?

316
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,708
Who is he?

317
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,625
Is that Richard?!

318
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,833
[Guyot growls in anger]

319
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,375
It's Archanfel!

320
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,125
[ARCHANFEL]
Don't you understand?

321
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,333
It doesn't matter how
much you struggle.

322
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,750
Before me, your strength
is meaningless.

323
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:17,250
You couldn't even give me the
slightest scratch.

324
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:22,500
[Guyot growls in anger]

325
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,375
Richard, I'll give you but
one word of advice.

326
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,666
You shouldn't anger a demigod.

327
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:48,041
[GUYOT]
<i>Stay calm, it's all right.</i>

328
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,375
<i>I have him right where</i>
<i>I want him.</i>

329
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,666
<i>There's no way I'll miss from</i>
<i>this distance.</i>

330
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,541
<i>I don't care who he is,</i>

331
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,791
<i>there's nothing on Earth</i>

332
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,291
<i>that can withstand an</i>
<i>attack like this!</i>

333
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,125
<i>This is the only way!</i>

334
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,583
<i>I can't allow a creature that</i>
<i>powerful to exist!</i>

335
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,166
Damn you, Richard! You can't!

336
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,041
You're going to kill us all!

337
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,041
You have to escape, Archanfel!

338
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,333
Hamilcar?

339
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,500
[Guyot roars with power]

340
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:31,541
This is the end, Archanfel!
Go to Hell!

341
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,916
What?!

342
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,166
[Guyot laughs with pleasure]

343
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:57,041
This power, it's...

344
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,666
[NARRATOR]
Taking refuge inside the Relic,

345
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,000
Sho prepares to launch the
ancient ship

346
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,958
and escape the collapsing
Chronos Base.

347
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,083
Then, Guyot appears before
them,

348
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:43,083
setting his sights
on the two Guyvers.

349
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,750
As he calls on the power of the
Remover,

350
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:48,083
the situation becomes desperate,

351
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:52,208
and Murakami is forced to engage
his final transformation.

352
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:56,125
Next time:
"Countdown to Collapse"
