00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,541
[MIZUKI] Tetsuro, please!
Answer me! What's wrong?!

3
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,041
What happened to Sho?!

4
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,208
I'll explain things later,
Mizuki.

5
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,750
We have to get going now.

6
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,125
What are you hiding from me?
Just say it!

7
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,416
[MURAKAMI] Come on, let's move!

8
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,208
We don't have time to stand
around bickering!

9
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,458
Is... is something wrong?
[MAKASHIMA] I can't expect you

10
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,583
to drive in weather like this
with your eyesight.

11
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,291
I better drive instead.

12
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,666
Why don't you let me drive?
I can handle it.

13
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,791
Shizu?

14
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,416
You must be exhausted,
Master Agito.

15
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Besides I'm a lot more familiar
with this area than you are.

16
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,041
[YOHEI] Shizu's learned a lot
in these past three years.

17
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,250
She's been working
really hard, you know.

18
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:08,250
She wants to be of use to you
in any way she can.

19
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,708
That's what she told me.

20
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:13,916
[MURAKAMI] All right, let's go.

21
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:28,833
[MIZUKI] <i>Am I the only one who</i>
<i>doesn't know what's happening?</i>

22
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,916
[DERZERB] I'm telling you, boss
there's no mistaking it!

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,791
That was a Zoalord!

24
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,708
Wh..When he was staring me down,

25
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,791
it's like my whole body was
frozen in fear.

26
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,041
It was exactly the same
as when you or Dr. Barcas

27
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,500
use your thought
waves to control us.

28
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,041
I think this demands
our immediate attention,

29
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,583
don't you, Doctor?

30
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,875
With a power like that,

31
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,166
if we don't take care of
him right away,

32
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,458
he could become an even bigger
obstacle than he is now.

33
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,541
After all, even the strongest
Zoanoids

34
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,500
are helpless against Zoalords.

35
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:58,791
Teamed with the Guyvers,

36
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,583
he poses a formidable
threat to us all.

37
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,875
Well, perhaps. He may seem
like a threat right now,

38
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,041
but it all depends on if
he's a real Zoalord or not.

39
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,916
Are you trying to tell me
he's not a Zoalord?

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,166
[BARCAS] I suppose we'll have to
put him to the test

41
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,875
and see what he's made of.

42
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:24,041
[TETSURO] <i>It's not your fault.</i>
<i>You didn't do anything wrong.</i>

44
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,625
[SHO] Tetsuro? What happened?
What have I been doing?

45
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,458
Just forget it. Don't think
about anything,

46
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,916
you just need to rest.

47
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:43,833
[SHO] Wait... No, it can't be.
D..Did I do this? Dad...

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,833
This can't be happening...

49
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,375

[TETSURO] <i>You're not the one</i>

53
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,875
[MURAKAMI] Let's take a break
from driving for a minute.

54
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:21,041
Are you all right?
[MIZUKI] Uh, yeah...

55
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,958
Grandfather, you ll find some
canned drinks

56
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,708
in the mini-cooler
sitting next to you.

57
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,375
Could you get her
something, please?

58
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,500
Oh, sure. I hope you like
this flavour alright.

59
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:33,041
Anything's okay, thanks.

60
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,583
Um, Shizu, is this really all
right?

61
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:39,750
I just... I don't know what I'm
supposed to do.

62
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:44,125
I mean, in a situation like
this, what CAN you do?

63
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:48,500
[thunder rumbles]

64
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,333
[SHIZU] Well, in my case,
I'm just trying to

65
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,833
serve Master Agito in any
way that I can.

[thunder grows louder]

69
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,541
Now what? I'm not sure where
to take it from here.

70
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,541
Well, I guess we, could go
back to town right?

71
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,625
We might be able to blend in
with a crowd, or, uh...

72
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,625
[MAKISHIMA] No, that won't work.

73
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,000
They'll be ready for us.

74
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,625
I'm sure Takeshiro is under
their control by now.

75
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,958
Yeah, you're right.

76
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm sure Barcas and Guyot are
watching the town.

77
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,125
All they have to do is
use their mind-link.

78
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,458
Unfortunately, that
means that no place is safe.

79
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,750
We should avoid being
seen by anyone.

These are the prototypes that

97
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,625

Their codenames are
zero-two, three and four.

100

Fumio Fukamachi was candidate
zero-one,

101
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,000
and while he may have looked the
same as these zoanoids,

102
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,916
there's a fundamental
difference between them.

103

00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,791
What... What's going on?

158
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,500
Are you all right?!

159
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,750
[MAKISHIMA] You idiot! What the
hell were you thinking!?

160
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,958
Don't disengage your armor in
the middle of battle!

161
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,583
Are you trying to get
yourself killed?

162
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:45,583
I wasn't trying to disengage it.
It just came off all by itself.

163
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,166
[SHO] <i>It's weird, I feel like</i>

164
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,250
<i>I've seen that kind of</i>
<i>Zoanoid before,</i>

165
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:58,500
<i>but I can't remember where.</i>
<i>Why is it bothering me so much?</i>

166
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,708
Tetsuro, this is the first
time

167
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,666
we've seen that kind of
Zoanoid, isn t it?

168
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,625
[TETSURO] <i>He doesn't remember?!</i>

169
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,208
It s no good. I can worry about
all that

170
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,708
after I've taken care of them.

171
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,000
Guyver!

172
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,166
Guy..Guyver!

173
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,666
I can't equip it?

174
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,291
Sho...

175
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:39,083
GUYVER!

176
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,541
[BARCAS] I had hoped that using
the boy's father

177
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,958
would have resulted in
Guyver I's defeat,

178
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,208
but it appears to have had
an interesting effect

179
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,833
on the boy's psyche.

180
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,250
[MURAKAMI]
<i>We're in trouble.</i>

181
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,833
<i>If I don't do something, we'll</i>
<i>all be killed.</i>

182
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,041
<i>I've really only got</i>
<i>one option.</i>

183
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,625
<i>After using my power last time,</i>
<i>it's a gamble,</i>

184
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:02,500
<i>but I've got to try.</i>
<i>It's do or die.</i>

185
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,583
Now, Theriomorph!

186
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,916
[Enzyme IIs growl in confusion]

187
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,916
Murakami?!

188
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,583
[SHO] <i>That's insane. I've never</i>
<i>seen power like that.</i>

189
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,875
<i>What in the world is he?</i>

190
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,708
Impressive strength.

191
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:46,208
Indeed, and after seeing him
transform, I know what he is.

192
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,833
Come on Richard, think. Take
a long good look at him.

193
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,708
Notice anything special?

194
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,333
[GUYOT] <i>Well, no matter</i>
<i>how I look at him,</i>

195
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:58,708
<i>he seems to possess the</i>
<i>battle form of a Zoalord.</i>

196
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:02,125
<i>No, that's impossible...</i>

197
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,291
[MURAKAMI] <i>I cannot afford to</i>
<i>prolong this.</i>

198
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,625
<i>I'll have to finish</i>
<i>them all at once!</i>

199
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,083
[Enzyme IIs roar]

200
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,750
[MURAKAMI] <i>Not good enough.</i>

201
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,916
[Enzyme II roars in pain]

202
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,875
[MURAKAMI]
<i>Ha..Have I reached my limit?</i>

203
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,875
[Enzyme II's death rattle]

204
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,083
Yes, he did it!

205
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,041
Hey! Is he... Murakami!

206
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,416
[BARCAS]
Well, what do you think?

207
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,791
Striking resemblance to your own
battle form, wouldn't you say?

208
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,375
Yes, that's true.

209
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,875
Then that must mean Mr. Murakami
is one of your test subjects.

210
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,916
So, he is just like me.

211
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,583
[GUYOT] <i>After all, I can't</i>
<i>forget that you were the one</i>

212
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,000
<i>who optimized me, Dr. Barcas!</i>

213
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,583
[SHO] <i>I don't get it. Why can't</i>
<i>I transform anymore?</i>

214
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,666
[TETSURO] <i>He really doesn't</i>
<i>remember what happened?</i>

215

<i>His father turning</i>
<i>into a Zoanoid?</i>

216
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,041
<i>I guess he wasn't conscious</i>

217

<i>when the Guyver went berserk</i>
<i>and killed him.</i>

<i>The shock was probably so great</i>

219
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,541

00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,958
<i>Even if he wasn't conscious,</i>
<i>he still...</i>

222
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,666
<i>Goddamn Chronos! They're</i>
<i>nothing</i>

223
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,000
<i>but a bunch of</i>
<i>sadistic bastards!</i>

224
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,666
[MIZUKI]
<i>What happened back there?</i>

225
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,333
<i>How did Sho end up like this?</i>

226
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,708
[Murakami stirs]

227
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,791
He's waking up!
Hey guys, look.

228
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,000
You okay, Murakami?

229
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,333
[MURAKAMI] Yeah,
but where are we?

230
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,458
You didn't miss much.

231
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,250
We're still in the
mountains right now.

232
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,583
Who are you? At this point, it's
obvious

233
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,375
you have some kind of connection
to Chronos.

234
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,708
It's probably okay to let us
know now, right?

235
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,708
About your true form, I mean.

236
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:37,041
Are you a Zoalord? Or what?
[TETSURO] A Zoalord?

237
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:40,000
Yeah, now that you mention it,

238
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,000
that's what those two Zoanoids
were calling him, isn't it?

239
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,750
So what is a Zoalord anyway?

240
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,083
Well, I've only heard the word
mentioned before,

241
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,666
so I don't really know
the details myself.

242
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,916
If you really wanna know,

243
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
they're Zoanoids of
the highest order.

244
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,333
They have the power to
command other Zoanoids.

245
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,458
They can form mental links with
any number of Zoanoids,

246
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,791
then control them as they
would their own bodies.

247
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,666
To those who have been
transformed into Zoanoids

248
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,500
the Zoalords are something
akin to Gods.

249
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:15,041
Only twelve individuals on this
planet possess these powers.

250
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,750
The twelve members of the
Chronos Board of Directors,

251
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,916
the men who rule this world
from the shadows.

252
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,125
And Guyot is one of
them isn't he?

253
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:27,166
No wonder he was able to
block my attack.

254
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,166
But if you're not one of them,
then what are you?

255
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,250
I was a test body for the final
Zoalord,

256
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,333
for Richard Guyot's battle form.

257
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:41,125
A test subject? So you were
a prototype Zoalord?

258
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,041
It all happened five years ago.

259
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,750
I was working as a magazine
correspondent at the time.

260
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,250
A team of reporters,
including myself,

261
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,958
had traveled to the jungles of
New Guinea to cover a story.

262
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,291
When we got to the site, the
villagers there were

263
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,875
all worked up about
some strange rumor.

264
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,041
They warned us that some kind
of "monsters"

265
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,291
had started appearing
in the area.

266
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,208
The local elders tried to stop
us from going any further,

267
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,958
but we didn't listen

268
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,500
and moved deeper into
the jungle.

269
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,083
It turned out that the place was

270
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,000
one of Chronos'
Zoanoid test sites.

271
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,708
All I could do was
stare in horror

272
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,083
as my colleagues were torn
limb from limb

273
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,333
by these terrible creatures.

274
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,791
I survived, but they weren't
done with me yet.

275
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:26,208
They took me to an underground
base of theirs in Arizona.

276
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,750
There, I served as their guinea
pig

277
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,875
for optimization experiments.

278
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,500
But then something strange
happened.

279
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,250
I had an unexpected reunion with

280
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:41,041
an old college professor of mine
named Shinichiro Yamamura.

281
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,958
[BARCAS] It's not just that he's
similar to you,

282
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,416
Richard, he's actually
your prototype.

283
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,125
[GUYOT] Ridiculous. How could a
test subject like that

284
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,291
still be alive after
all these years?

285
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,375
[BARCAS] I want you to recall a
certain event

286
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,125
that occurred five years
ago in Arizona.

287
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:59,875
[GUYOT] Arizona? Professor
Yamamura's rebellion?!

288
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,125
Correct.

289
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:09,583
Yamamura, who had been the brain
of Chronos for 15 years,

290
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,458
plotted to incite a rebellion

291
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,291
by stirring up several
of his own experiments,

292
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:19,083
who had out lasted their
usefulness.

293
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,041
All though test subjects,

294
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,291
they still possessed the powers
of a true Zoalord,

295
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,958
which lead to quite an uproar
at that headquarters.

296
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,750
[GUYOT] I only found out about
the incident later.

297
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:35,291
At the time, I was in the final
phase of Zoalord optimization.

298
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,541
They went on a rampage,

299
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,875
destroying every optimization
tank in sight.

300
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:43,583
Although their plan failed, it
was you they were after.

301
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,541
Fortunately, I and the other
Zoalords

302
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,041
were gathered at the base.

303
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,625
It was a ordeal, but the
situation was resolved.

304
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,208
The insurgents were rounded up

305
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,166
and destroyed in the test
subject disposal tank,

306
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,916
as they should have been
in the first place.

307
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,333
Or so we thought. Knowing that
one of them survived,

308
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,541
I'm rather
taken aback.

309
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:08,000
Now, the question is, why were
the test subjects

310
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,541
so determined to
destroy you Guyot?

311
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:15,333
Ah, yes, I was wondering
about that myself.

312
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,833
Watch out, Richard. We don't
know Murakami's objectives.

313
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,916
If we don't take care of him
quickly,

314
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,583
he may make another attempt
on your life.

315
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,666
[GUYOT] <i>This is a mystery to me.</i>

316
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,416
<i>When I awoke, my optimization</i>
<i>had ended,</i>

317
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,583
<i>and the situation had already</i>
<i>been resolved.</i>

318
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,750
<i>Professor Yamamura, what</i>
<i>were you plotting?</i>

319
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,708
<i>It couldn't be! Maybe he KNEW!</i>

320
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,000
[TETSURO] So Professor Yamamura
was the one

321
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:45,166
that made you into one of
Guyot's prototypes.

322
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,625
That's right. At the time,
there were already

323
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,375
three other prototypes that
had sided with the professor.

324
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:55,166
Unfortunately, they were part
of Barcus' experiments.

325
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,666
At first, they resented
the professor,

326
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,416
but once they knew his true
intent,

327
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,541
they changed their minds.

328
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,541
They knew that he was risking
his life.

329
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:07,708
They understood the magnitude
of the situation.

330
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:11,000
20 years ago, Professor Yamamura
advocated the theory

331
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,875
that Mount Minakami was
actually man-made.

332
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,750
His studies lead him to uncover
the secret of the Creators

333
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:20,416
buried within the ancient ruins
inside the mountain.

334
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,208
By that time, Chronos had
also caught wind

335
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,250
of the mountain's secret,

336
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,791
and kidnapped the professor.

337
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:29,416
He was then made to cooperate
with them against his will.

338
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,666
For 15 years, he pretended
to be their pawn,

339
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,750
all the while waiting
for an opportunity

340
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,875
to topple the organization
from the inside out.

341
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,666
It was then that he discovered
the horrifying truth

342
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,000
behind the Guyvers.

343
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,041
It was a truth that had shaped
history,

344
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:49,541
a truth that could
destroy our future.

345
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,916
[NARRATOR] The truth
behind the Guyver units

346
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,625
and their connection
to mankind is revealed.

347
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,000
Unable to accept the grim
reality,

348
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,708
Mizuki flees from her friends.

349
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,666
Sho follows her into the woods

350
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,166
and expresses his own
feelings of doubt.

351
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,958
Meanwhile, Guyot decides to
personally eliminate everyone

352
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,916
that stands in his path.

353
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,583
The powerful cries of a
Zoalord quake the earth.

354
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:56,458
Next time:
"Guyot Joins the Fray"
