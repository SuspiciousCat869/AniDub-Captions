1
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,625
[APTOM] <i>Just watch, you son</i>
<i>of a bitch.</i>

2
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:12,291
<i>I won't let you get away with</i>
<i>what you did to me.</i>

3
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,375
<i>I don't know who the</i>
<i>hell that guy was,</i>

4
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,250
<i>but it looked like he was</i>
<i>heading towards Relic's Point.</i>

5
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,916
<i>Something big's about to happen</i>
<i>on Mount Minakami,</i>

6
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,541
<i>and I'm not gonna miss it.</i>

7
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,291
 Let's go!

8
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:43,291
[BARCAS] I was right, it is
indeed Archanfel.

9
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:49,541
Why? Surely he didn't come here
just to take care of Guyot.

10
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:53,208
[ARCHANFEL] Listen Richard,
hand over the Remover now,

11
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:59,125
and I might actually over look
your little betrayal.

12
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,875
You see, my plans call for
twelve Zoalords,

13
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,916
and they aren't easy to replace.

14
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,833
I show no mercy to those
who defy me.

15
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:13,291
So then, show me the Guyver
Remover, Richard!

16
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,083
The Guyver Remover?

17
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:18,416
[GUYOT] <i>No! I can't hand</i>
<i>it over now!</i>

18
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,750
<i>Not after all I've gone</i>
<i>through! How did he find out?</i>

19
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,875
<i>Only I should know about the</i>
<i>Remover!</i>

20
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:28,125
<i>And of all people, why did</i>
<i>it have to be HIM?!</i>

21
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,708
<i>Everything about him is</i>
<i>a mystery to me.</i>

22
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,125
<i>All I know is that he's the</i>
<i>head of the Council of Zoalords</i>

23
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,750
<i>and the founder of Chronos.</i>

24
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,750
<i>But what is this power?!</i>

25
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,958
<i>This suffocating sense of</i>
<i>intimidation?</i>

26
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,250
<i>It's as if I'm frozen in awe!</i>

27
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,333
<i>What the hell is</i>
<i>going on here?!</i>

28
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,625
[MAKISHIMA] What's wrong?
[SHO] Oh, nothing.

29
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:08,875
I was just thinking the Guyvers

30
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:12,208
look kind of silly with these
cameras on them.

31
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,458
[MAKISHIMA] Well, guess
it could be worse.

32
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,875
[ODAGIRI] All right, everyone...

33
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,500
This is a component diagram of
the Relic

34
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,291
that we constructed
based on data

35
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,000
obtained from similar ruins
throughout the world.

36
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:31,041
As you see, this is the current
location of the two Guyvers.

37
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,333
They will approach the Relic's
intereior from this point.

38
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:37,000
You have to come back, please.

39
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,250
[MIZUKI] <i>Seeing Shizu so calm</i>

40
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,958
<i>makes me feel a lot</i>
<i>better about this.</i>

41
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,791
[locator beeping]

42
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,458
[SHO] My control metal!

43
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,083
[MAKISHIMA] Yeah, mine too.

44
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,125
[ODAGIRI] Remarkable...

45
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,666
Its outer wall is opening
by itself.

46
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,750
[ODAGIRI] <i>It's just</i>
<i>as I expected...</i>

47
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,375
<i>The Relic automatically opens a</i>
<i>path to its interior</i>

48
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,041
<i>in response to the will</i>
<i>of the Guyver.</i>

49
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,041
The outer hull of the Relic is
resilient,

50
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,500
but no more so than
steel or iron.

51
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:51,666
We've been able to breach it
then, with various tools.

52
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,916
But there's another issue, a
layer beneath the hull.

53
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,166
Or rather, a series of
tissue-like layers

54
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,333
extending to the
interior of the ship.

55
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,125
In a sense, it's like the
Relic's epidermis.

56
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,333
But when we attempted to
penetrate it with machinery,

57
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,541
we found that it secretes a
highly acidic compound.

58
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:12,208
Every device exposed to it
is instantly corroded.

59
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,958
In search of another solution,

60
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,916
we tested its effect on organic
materials as well.

61
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,166
Though still deadly,

62
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,791
the compound's effects
were less pronounced.

63
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,416
For that reason, Zoanoids were
deemed more suitable

64
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,958
for use than machinery,

65
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,333
and a great number were employed

66
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,000
in operations to breach the
interior of the ship.

67
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,583
Unfortunately, the majority of
them were dissolved

68
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:35,458
before breaking through the
first sub-layer of the barrier.

69
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,416
Of course, breaching the ship
was only half the battle.

70
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,416
Those who made it inside found

71
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,416
they would have to penetrate the
barrier once again

72
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,375
on their way out.

73
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,583
This is because the damaged part
of the sub-layer

74
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,625
would regenerate itself
almost instantly,

75
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:53,416
closing the opening to the ship.
After countless failed attempts,

76
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,666
one Zoanoid returned with the
Guyver Units,

77
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,916
but disintegrated
immediately upon exit.

78
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,541
So you see, that's what I
meant when I said

79
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:06,208
no one had successfully entered
the Relic... and returned alive.

80
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:09,875
Then, even if our friends make
it inside, they still might die?

81
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,666
Oh no...

82
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,750
But they have the Guyvers. That
should be enough, shouldn t it?

83
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:28,625
We'll have to see. Although
it's only a hypothesis, but yes.

84
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,833
If the crew of the ship wore
those Guyver Units,

85
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,666
then your friends
should be safe.

86
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,708
[SHO] All right.

87
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,291
[MAKISHIMA] It looks like
we've reached the end

88
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,791
of the epidermal tissue layer
Dr. Odagiri was talking about.

89
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,416
Perfect, they're in!

90
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,500
[MAKISHIMA] Ah! Fukamachi!
Behind you!

91
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,000
[SHO] We're shut in!

92
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,583
[SHO] What's going on?

93
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,750
Sho!

94
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,875
[MAKISHIMA] What, is it
trying to drown us now?

95
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,125
[ODAGIRI] Listen to me!

96
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,125
The two of you need to get
out of there now!

97
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,666
[MAKISHIMA]
It's all right, Doctor.

98
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,000
The liquid doesn't seem to be
toxic or corrosive.

99
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,166
[SHO] Is this the inside
of the Relic?

100
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,166
[strange, eerie wailing sounds]

101
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,958
[wailing sounds &amp;
bubbling continue]

102
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,666
[SHO] Makishima, look!

103
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,458
[MAKISHIMA] I see,

104
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,416
instead of having a fixed
entrance and exit,

105
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,458
the ship's walls open and
close as needed.

106
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,083
There was no way for Dr. Odagiri
to know that,

107
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,333
because he had never seen a
Guyver try to enter the ship.

108
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,208
For others, there is a barrier,
but for us,

109
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,833
a path opens automatically.

110
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,291
The epidermal tissue layers
that we passed through

111
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,333
were probably designed as a
defense system

112
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,916
to prevent forced entry.

113
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,250
Since we didn't force our way,

114
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,541
we never encountered any
corrosive fluids.

115
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,666
Simple system, huh?
[SHO] Yeah...

116
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,416
[MAKISHIMA] Dr. Odagiri, can you
tell us our current location?

117
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,416
[ODAGIRI] You're just beneath
the corrosive barrier,

118
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,750
in one of a series of small,
segmented rooms.

119
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,583
They were most likely either
living areas or storehouses,

120
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,208
so they're of no interest.

121
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,750
If you continue on course,

122
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,541
you'll reach the
center of the ship.

123
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,875
You'll be coming up on the
main bridge soon.

124
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,125
I'll give you directions
when you get there.

125
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,916
[MAKISHIMA] Understood.

126
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,916
[wailing &amp; bubbling continues]

127
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,708
[ARCHANFEL] What's it
going to be, Guyot?

128
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:41,333
Will you hand over the Remover
quietly? Or won't you?

129
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,458
[GUYOT] The answer is...

130
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,958
 NO!

131
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,250
[SOLDIER] What's going on?!

132
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,625
[SOLDIERS] It's Commander Guyot!

133
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,708
[GUYOT] Get out of my way!

134
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:16,416
[Guyot yells]

135
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,333
[SOLDIER] That was strange.
Did something happen?

136
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,416
You're a fool if you think you
can escape from me.

137
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,291
I'll make you pay for your
arrogance, just wait.

138
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,625
[BARCAS] <i>That's right, Richard,</i>
<i>run away.</i>

139

143
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:58,541
<i>Even with all combined Zoanoid</i>
<i>forces, we'd stand no chance.</i>

144
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,875
<i>That will be painfully</i>
<i>obvious soon enough,</i>

145
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:06,041
<i>as it was to the prototype</i>
<i>Zoalord that you defeated.</i>

146

<i>But what I can't figure out is</i>
<i>why you keep going down.</i>

147
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,375
<i>Once you reach</i>
<i>the lowest level,</i>

148
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,125

<i>nowhere else to run,</i>

149
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:17,541
<i>and Archanfel will have you</i>
<i>cornered like a rat in a trap.</i>

150

<i>Now I understand! That precious</i>
<i>Remover of yours is on,</i>

152
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,000
[MAKISHIMA] Well, this is
an odd looking place.

153
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:52,041
[SHO] Makishima, look at this.

154
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,375
[MAKISHIMA] I see!

155
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,041
This must be where they found
the Guyver Units.

156
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,791
I thought I'd see something
like this.

157
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,458
So have they made it to
the center yet?

158
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:04,208
I think so. If our maps are
correct, they should be close.

159
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,541
[SHO] Doctor, it looks like
something

160
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,083
besides the units was
taken from here.

161
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,416
Are you sure?

162
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,583
[SHO] Yeah, there's
an empty spot

163
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,625
right next to where the
units were stored.

164
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,208
Can you see? What do you
think was there?

165
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,000
At this point, my only guess is
that the item

166
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,333
was secretly removed
by Dr. Shirai

167
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:25,208
and that it somehow relates to
his current research.

168
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,833
But if that's the case, then I'm
worried

169
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,208
that it might have some
connection to the units,

170
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,458
especially with Guyot showing so
much interest

171
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,958
in the doctor s work.

172
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,166
[MAKISHIMA] Then it looks like
the situation

173
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,166
could easily turn from bad
to worse for us.

174
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,458
Regardless, all we can do now is

175
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,083
continue our search for the
Relic's controls.

176
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:46,083
You're right, we don't have time
to worry about the details.

177
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,333
If the composite maps we
constructed are accurate,

178
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,041
then the ship's main bridge
should be directly beneath you.

179
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,958
[MAKISHIMA] Beneath us...

180
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,750
[MAKISHIMA] Not quite
what I expected.

181
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,750
[SHO] So, now what?

182
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,041
If this is the cockpit,

183
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,708
then how are we supposed to
pilot this thing?

184
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,000
[MAKISHIMA] Sho,
our control metals!

185
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,541
There's been a sudden rise

186
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:34,916
in the Relic's
biometric response!

187
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,875
Output levels are off
the scales!

188
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,666
The time has come!

189
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,125
At last, the Relic awakens
from its eons of slumber!

190
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,791
[SHO] Makishima, look!

191
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,833
What the hell's going on here?

192
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,333
The Relic...

193
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,333
That orb's like a giant
control metal!

194
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,916
[SHO] There's another
one on the ceiling.

195
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,166
[SHO] I'm floating!

196
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,833
[MAKISHIMA] Fukamachi!

197
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,958
[SHO] It's pulling us in!

198
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,458
[SHO] Makishima!

199
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,083
[MAKISHIMA] Use your gravity
controller! Hurry!

200
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,500
[MAKISHIMA] Fukamachi!

201
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,375
Sho!

202
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,625
[MAKISHIMA] His control metal!

203
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,083
It's separating.

204
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,875
[MAKISHIMA] Damn it!

205
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,875
SHO!

206
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,041
If his control metal keeps
separating like that,

207
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,750
it'll sever his link with the
Guyver

208
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,750
and his armor will completely
devour him!

209
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:39,500
Why are you just standing there,
Makishima?! DO something!

210
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,708
Get Sho out of there, now!

211
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,250
[MAKISHIMA] Calm down, Segawa.

212
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,583
The situation seems to
have stabilized.

213
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,583
Let's just see what happens.

214
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:50,958
Whatever it is, it doesn't seem
to be a trap

215
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,750
or one of the Relic's
defense mechanisms.

216
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,666
Are you sure?

217
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,375
[ODAGIRI] The beam of light
isn't just holding Sho in place,

218
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,708
it's connecting his control
metal to the metallic orbs

219
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,333
on the ceiling and floor.

220
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:04,291
Like the control metal links the
user's brain to the Guyver,

221
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:07,083
the metallic orbs should link
the Guyver to the ship.

222
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,333
Right now, I believe the
Relic's main computer

223
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,458
is establishing a direct
connection to Sho's brain.

224
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,583
If so, he should be able to will
the ship into motion.

225
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,416
Sho...

226
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,500
Wh..Where am I?

227
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,291
<i>I see, these images are a</i>
<i>record</i>

228
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,125
<i>of how the Creators</i>
<i>manipulated life on Earth.</i>

229
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,250
<i>It's just like Murakami said.</i>

230
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:11,041
<i>They made everything, all the</i>
<i>creatures on this planet,</i>

231
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,541
<i>just to create a living weapon.</i>

232
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,333
<i>The world as we know it was</i>
<i>nothing but a failed experiment</i>

233
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,291
<i>until humans were made,</i>
<i>until we became the basis</i>

234
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,333
<i>for what was supposed to be</i>
<i>the ultimate bioweapon.</i>

235
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,416
<i>That's why we were modified to</i>
<i>create Zoanoids.</i>

236
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,958
<i>The true evolution of mankind,</i>
<i>an instrument of war...</i>

237
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,708
<i>That's... a Guyver.</i>

238
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:42,291
<i>I see, this was one of their</i>
<i>experiments too.</i>

239
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,666
<i>They equipped one of their</i>
<i>Guyver Units on a human</i>

240
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,500
<i>to see what the</i>
<i>effects would be.</i>

241
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,666
<i>But they didn't know it would</i>
<i>be so powerful.</i>

242
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,583
<i>They didn't know it would free</i>
<i>humans from their influence.</i>

243
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,333
<i>That's why they called it</i>
<i>"out of control."</i>

244
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,000
<i>That's why Chronos fears</i>
<i>the Guyvers.</i>

245
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,625
<i>What was that? His unit</i>
<i>was unequipped?!</i>

246
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:15,000
<i>No,it was more than that...</i>
<i>It was completely removed.</i>

247
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,458
<i>It's like they severed his</i>
<i>link</i>

248
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,458
<i>with the Guyver and returned</i>
<i>it to a unit.</i>

249
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,041
[MIZUKI] What's going on?
He's not moving!

250
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,625
Is he going to be okay, Doctor?

251
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,750
I'm afraid I can't say.

252
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,416
You're kidding...

253
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:42,791
[MIZUKI] Sho... Hang on!
You have to make it back!

254
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,541
Please!

255
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,000
Sho!

256
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:50,416
[SHO] <i>Mizuki...</i>

257
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,000
[MAKISHIMA] Doctor, he's waking
up! I think he's all right.

258
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,875
Sho...

259
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,500
Fukamachi, are you receiving me?

260
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:02,041
[SHO] I can hear you, but what
the heck just happened?

261
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:06,125
It's all right, just stay calm
and listen to my voice.

262
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,500
The Guyver's control metal seems
to have created a link

263
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,708
between your brain and the
Relic's main computer.

264
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:15,000
It must have been initiated by
the beam and the metallic orbs.

265
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,041
The Creators likely used the
same method to pilot the ship,

266
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,166
connecting to the Relic and
Guyvers in the same way.

267
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,333
If that's the case, then you
should be able to

268
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,625
control the Relic
to do as you will!

269
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,375
[SHO] Control the Relic?

270
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,625
Well, let's see... Try this.

271
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,541
Since the Relic is vibrating
right now,

272
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,333
see if you can get it to
return to normal.

273
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,750
If not, the lower levels are
going to collapse

274
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,375
and bury us alive.

275
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,291
[SHO] All right, I'll
give it a try.

276
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,166
<i>There are people I have to</i>
<i>protect up there,</i>

277
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,958
<i>people who are counting on me.</i>

278
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,458
<i>I have to do this for Tetsuro,</i>

279
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,833
<i>who's looked after</i>
<i>me all my life...</i>

280
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,458
<i>and... for Mizuki.</i>

281
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,208
Please...

282
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,833
[SHO] <i>I have to do this.</i>

283
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,250
<i>I have to stop the Relic from</i>
<i>destroying the lab!</i>

284
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:25,166
It just stopped. Is it over?

285
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,666
It really worked! If Sho can
activate the ship,

286
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,708
we might actually
stand a chance!

287
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:40,083
[SHO] <i>I can see it.</i>
<i>I can see it all...</i>

288
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:44,458
<i>The ship's structure, it's</i>
<i>energy reactors... everything.</i>

289
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:48,333
<i>The entire ship is in the</i>
<i>palm of my hand!</i>

290
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,000
<i>I can move it!</i>
<i>I can command it!</i>

291
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:55,041
<i>It's like I've become the</i>
<i>brain of the ship!</i>

292
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,708
[NARRATOR] The hunter has
become the hunted.

293
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,958
As Guyot flees in a
desperate attempt

294
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:36,416
to escape Archanfel's wrath,

295
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,083
the furious chase causes chaos
throughout Relic's Point.

296
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:43,208
Seeking to take advantage
of the situation,

297
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:47,541
Aptom launches a surprise attack
on the hyper-Zoanoid elites.

298
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:51,125
Meanwhile, Dr. Odagiri's plan to
reclaim the Relic

299
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,416
moves into its final stages.

300
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,250
Next time:
"Relic's Point in Disarray"
