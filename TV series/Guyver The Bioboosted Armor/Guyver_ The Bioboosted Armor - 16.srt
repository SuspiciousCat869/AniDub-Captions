00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:09,958
[SHO]
<i>What the hell happened here?</i>

2
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,541
Sho!

3
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,791
It's Guyot!

4
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,291
So Guyot was the one who
caused all of this?

5
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,125
Hey! I don't see our friends!

6
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,791
What do you think
happened to them?

7
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,750
Come on, don't look so...

8
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,125
I mean, they must have
gotten away, right?

9
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,500
Shhh!

10
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,750
[MIZUKI] What is it?!

11
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,916
[SHO] It's Chronos.

12
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,250
[SOLDIER]
Take your squadron

13
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:08,208
and scan the following
sectors: G... A...

14
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,250
[Zoanoids growling and hissing]

15
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,583
[DERZERB] This seems like a
waste of time to me.

16
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:14,958
I doubt there's anyone

17
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,166
that could survive Commander
Guyot's gravity attack.

18
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,458
Remember our enemies are

19
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,416
the Guyver III and that
proto-Zoalord.

20
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,208
We shouldn't underestimate them.

21
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,083
That reminds me, I thought one
of the Lost Numbers

22
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,875
was supposed to be monitering
the situation.

23
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,541
Shouldn't he be around
here somewhere?

24
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,916
You mean that Aptom guy?

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,625
That prick's always acting like
he's too good to work with us.

26
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,666
Oh well, his loss.

27
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,000
[ZX-TOLE]
I don't see why Dr. Barcas

28
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,833
keeps that piece of crap around.

29
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,541
He's not even an Adaption
Number Zoanoid.

30
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:42,875
You'd think somebody would just
throw him away

31
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,416
after he's failed to optimize
so many times.

32
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,541
Maybe Barcas just feels sorry
for him, or something.

33
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,208
[ELEGEN] Well, at least he makes
a good guinea pig, right?

34
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,250
That's probably enough reason to
keep him around

35
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,791
till all the experimentation
kills him.

36
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,875
DERZERB] Oh, I get it. So the
doctor's just letting him live

37
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,375
so he can play around with him.

38
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,583
[BRESNEL] Hey, did you hear?

39
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,875
The report says that Sho
kid can't transform

40
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,250
into the Guyver anymore.

41
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,000
That's gonna make our job a
hell of a lot easier!

42
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,541
[RAZELL] No kidding.

43
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,208
Plus, Commander Guyot went ahead
finished off the Guyver III

44
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,708
and that proto-Zoalord for us.

45
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,833
Good thing too I was afraid
we were gonna get torn in half

46
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,458
or blown up or something.

47
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,750
[SHO] <i>So Guyot got to them.</i>
<i>I was afraid of this.</i>

48
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,166
<i>If nothing else, I have</i>
<i>to protect Mizuki.</i>

49
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,708
[RAZELL] Huh? I found them!
Over there!

50
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:51,916
[Zoanoids growling]

51
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,791
Stand back.

52
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:03,500
GUYVER!

53
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,666
Oh, no...

54
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,958
[RAZELL] Look at him
trying to scare us!

55
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,416
[BRESNEL] See, I told you!

56
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,583
He can't turn in the Guyver
anymore! He's nothing now!

57
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,416
[SHO] <i>What's wrong? Why</i>
<i>can't I bioboost?</i>

58
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,291
[EURENORM] Give it up, kid.
You're finished!

59
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:28,041
[GUYVER III] If you want them,
you have to go through me first.

60
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,541
Sho, is that...

61
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,250
[SHO] <i>It can't be, but...</i>

62
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,416
<i>No way...</i>
[RAMOTITH] Guyver III?!

63
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,541
[BRESNEL]
But that's impossible!

64
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:36,708
He should have been destroyed

65
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,375
by Commander Guyot's
gravity attack!

66
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,583
[GUYVER III] We'll all be in
trouble

67
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,375
if those four
hyper-Zoanoids show up.

68
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,583
Get out of here, now.

69
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,916
Makishima?
[GUYVER III] I said, go!

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,708
[SHO] Uh, right!

71
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,083
[GUYVER III] You're not laying a
finger on Sho Fukamachi.

72
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,875
[RAMOTITH] Oh, yeah?!

73
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:56,958
[GUYVER III] [chuckles]
Because he's MY prey!

74
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,833
[GUYOT] <i>I've eliminated every</i>
<i>one of my obstacles.</i>

75
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,375
<i>Now, if I could only find</i>
<i>a way</i>

76
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,541
<i>to recapture Sho's</i>
<i>Guyver unit...</i>

77
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,541
[DOCTOR] Commander, Doctor
Barcas is here to see you.

78
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:12,208
You're in much better shape
than I expected, Richard.

79
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,791
It was rather reckless for a
Zoalord like yourself

80
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,291
to put his life on the line,

81
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:20,166
especially without a plan,
or proper backup.

82
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,500
That so-called "recklessness"
enabled me to destroy

83
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,541
both the test subject and his
traitorous little friend.

84
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:31,833
[BARCAS] Ah yes, funny that
you should mention Guyver III.

85
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,625
We just recieved word that
Guyver III destroyed

86
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,541
several members of our
reconaissance team.

87
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,291
What'd you say?!

88
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,791
[GUYOT]
<i>That little bastard SURVIVED!</i>

89
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,541
[MIZUKI] Well, I'm glad.

90
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,458
At least, we know Makishima
is all right.

91
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,250
[SHO] Yeah, that's true.

92
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,416
Hey, we should be safe as long
as we hide in here, right?

93
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,125
Yeah...

94
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,875
[SHO] <i>Was that really Makishima?</i>

95
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,125
<i>Maybe it was just</i>
<i>my imagination,</i>

96
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,500
<i>but something seemed</i>
<i>different about him.</i>

97
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,208
[MIZUKI] Hey, Sho?

98
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,833
Since Makishima made it out
okay, then that means Tetsuro...

99
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,166
Well, uh, what I mean is,

100
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,750
everyone should be
okay too, right?

101
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:27,208
Yeah! After all, they had
Murakami to protect them.

102
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,041
I'm sure they made it out fine.

103
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,750
[SHO] <i>We may be safe for now,</i>
<i>but if Chronos finds us,</i>

104
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,625
<i>we'll be in bad shape.</i>

105
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,291
<i>Until I can find a way</i>
<i>to bioboost,</i>

106
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,958
<i>I can't protect Mizuki.</i>

107
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,041
Mizuki?

108
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,041
Uh... hmmm?

109
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,833
[SHO] Could you help me
out for a second?

110
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:56,041
I'm trying to get back my
ability to turn into the Guyver.

111
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,875
That's fine, but what are
we supposed to do?

112
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,708
[SHO] That's what we need
to figure out.

113
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,541
Hey, uh, Sho, what are those?!

114
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,875
[SHO] There are these little
growths

115
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,791
that call the Guyver out from
another dimension.

116
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,500
I should have them on my upper
back. are they still there?

117
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,541
You mean these things that
look like scars?

118
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,458
[SHO] Yeah, I'm glad I
still have them.

119
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,708
So, even if I can't bioboost, at
least that means

120
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,041
I haven't been separated
from the Guyver.

121
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,625
[MIZUKI] Okay, whatever! I saw
the scars already.

122
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:27,541
Now, put your shirt back on!
[SHO] Oh, uh, sorry!

123
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,916
[SHO] I didn't think that was
the problem,

124
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,250
but I can't figure
out what's wrong.

125
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,083
There must be some reason why
I can't bioboost.

126
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,375
[MIZUKI] Hmm...

127
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,375
Well, I-uh, don't know much
about this stuff,

128
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,916
but when did you stop being able
to transform into the Guyver?

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Umm, it started when that
white Zoanoid was attacking me.

130
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,291
As soon as I saw it,
everything just stopped.

131
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,541
I've never been just,

132
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,041
seperated from the Guyver
like that before.

133
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:56,875
[MIZUKI] Then, you think that
white Zoanoid caused it?

134
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,958
Yeah, but it's weird. I felt
like I'd seen one before.

135
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,833
Let's see. I think that
kind was called...

136
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,416
Enzyme II, or something.

137
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,958
What did you say?! There's
something about that name...

138
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,916
Is something the matter?

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,833
It's just, I've heard that
name before, but I can't...

140
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,083
[MIZUKI] You can t what?

141
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,041
[SHO] I can't figure out what
Enzyme has to do with me

142
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,375
being unable to transform.

143
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:24,708
[MIZUKI] Sho, listen. You did go
to Mount Minakami, right?

144
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:28,291
To rescue your, ah,
Dad from Chronos.

145
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,416
You're right!

146
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,041
I remember now! I went to Mount
Minakami to rescue my dad.

147
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,500
[SHO] <i>But then something</i>
<i>happened.</i>

148
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,500
[retching sounds]

149
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,750
That's enough, okay!

150
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,833
Just calm down and stop thinking
about it! Sho!

151
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,958
No, it's not that I had
forgotten about it,

152
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,166
it's that I was blocking
it out for some reason.

153
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,333
I've got to remember, what the
hell happened back there?

154
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,958
[APTOM] I might be able to
help you with that.

155
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,291
Makishima, you found us!

156
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:18,125
[SHO] No! Get back Mizuki,
that's not Makishima!

157
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:22,041
[Aptom laughs]
Very good, sharp eye, kid,

158
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,125
but the charade's over.

159
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,958
You're that same zoaniod!

160
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,375
Oh, so you do remember?

161
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,125
Yes, I'm Aptom of the Lost
Number Commandos.

162
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,750
The last time we met, I
fought beside my comrades,

163
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,333
Somlum and Dyme.

164
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,500
[SHO] Then why did you save us
from those Zoanoids back there?

165
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:43,208
[APTOM] Don't make me laugh. You
haven't been saved at all!

166
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,625
I just didn't want
to lose my prey

167
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,875
to a bunch of useless weaklings.
The hunt is still on.

168
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,416
[SHO] The hunt?!

169
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,875
[APTOM] That's right. I am the
hunter and you are my prey.

170
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,666
I've come here to avenge
Somlum and Dyme!

171
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,916
I had no choice but
to kill them.

172
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,750
[APTOM] Oh, I almost forgot.

173
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,166
I suppose I should tell you what
happened

174
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,541
between you and your father,
shouldn't I?

175
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,500
It happened on Mount Minakami,

176
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,708
and it was so traumatic that

177
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,625
it made you lose your ability
to bioboost.

178
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,333
Ha! You know, I don't have to
tell you any of this.

179
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,208
I could snap your puny little
neck

180
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,916
before you even
knew what hit you.

181
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,958
But, no! Then my revenge
would be meaningless!

182
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,083
Now, don't you get it? It's not
just you,

183
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,250
but the Guyver I that
I have to crush,

184
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,625
torment and drive
to the depths of Hell!

185
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,208
Only THEN will I be satisfied!

186
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,208
But since you still don't
remember anything,

187
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,041
it must be buried pretty deep.

188
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,166
I imagine when it finally DOES
come back to you,

189
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,166
you'll go out of your mind!

190
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,416
Please, leave him alone! None
of this is his fault!

191
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,708
Hasn't he suffered
enough already?!

192
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,250
[SHO] It's all right.

193
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,541
I want to be able to transform
into the Guyver,

194
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,208
because I have to
protect you, Mizuki!

195
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,291
Such commendable resolve.

196
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,416
If you think you can handle
the truth, I'll tell you!

197
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:04,458
You killed your father, with
your own two hands!

198
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,083
I killed him? I killed my
father?

199
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:10,875
No, you're lying! You're lying!

200
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,500
[APTOM] After the five
elites took your father

201
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:19,708
back to Relic's Point,

202
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,250
Dr. Barcus transformed him into

203
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,833
the test version of the
Zoanoid Enzyme II.

204
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,291
Of course, when you came to
rescue him,

205
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,083
you weren't aware, so
when he transformed,

206
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,958
he was able to split your
head wide open.

207
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,708
Touching, isn't it?
Reunited at last,

208
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,708
a father and son that can't wait
to bash each other's brains out!

209
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:40,750
That can't be. Sho's Dad would
never do that to him.

210
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,791
[APTOM] After your brain had
been pulverized,

211
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,375
you lost control of the Guyver
and it was forced to enter its

212
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,541
emergency self-defense
mode to survive.

213
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,666
You mean, after I lost
consciousness,

214
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,791
then... the Guyver...

215
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,791
You guessed it!

216
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,750
[Sho screams in anguish]

217
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:17,458
[SHO] That was his arm... That
was Dad's arm!

218
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,958
I... I killed him.

219
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,750
I killed my own father... [sobs]

220
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,541
Oh, God...

221
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,291
That's right! Aren't you proud
of what you've done?

222
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,166
You murdered your father with
the power of the Guyver,

223
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,791
just like you murdered
Somlum and Dyme!

224
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,375
[MIZUKI] Please, he doesn't
deserve this.

225
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,708
So now do you
finally understand?

226
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,916
This is why you haven't been
able to transform!

227
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,708
Because you hate the Guyver!

228
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,083
You hate it for killing your
father,

229
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,791
and you hate yourself
for using it!

230
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,375
You were afraid to admit it,

231
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,875
but it's all been stewing
deep inside.

232
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,583
You couldn't transform anymore

233
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,875
because of your own
self-loathing!

234
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,291
[Sho grunts in pain]
[Mizuki screams] Sho!

235
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,958
[APTOM] You have no one to
blame but yourself.

236
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,375
When you became the Guyver,

237
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,666
you brought pain and suffering
to everyone you know.

238
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:10,291
My father died because
of the Guyver...

239
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:15,416
Because of me everyone will...
will be killed, all because...

240
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,416
Now, you get it. Your father
died because of you.

241
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,125
You got your friends involved in
this

242
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,166
and they ended up dead at the
hands of Guyot.

243
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,125
So who's next? When will it end?

244
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,791
None of this would
have happened!

245
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,083
None of them would have been
killed

246
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,583
if you had never
become the Guyver,

247
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,000
if you had never activated
the unit!

248
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,166
It's not your fault!

249
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,458
[APTOM] Let's see...

250
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,708
[SHO] Mizuki!

251
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,333
[APTOM] Are you going to cause
her death too?

252
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,166
[MIZUKI] Let me go!

253
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,875
Mizuki!

254
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,958
Sho, are you okay?!

255
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,375
You bastard, let her go.

256
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,541
Mizuki has nothing
to do with this.

257
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,958
[APTOM] [laughs] Look at you!
You're pathetic!

258
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,375
Do you expect me to listen
to your whimpering?

259
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,041
Maybe you forgot, I said I
wouldn't be satisfied

260
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,500
until I made you suffer!

261
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,250
[MIZUKI] SHO!

262
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,125
How can you do this to him?!

263
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:05,166
None of this would have happened
if you just left Sho alone!

264
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,458
You're the ones who forced
him to kill his father!

265
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,875
He never wanted to become the
Guyver in the first place!

266
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,791
He never wanted
to hurt anyone!

267
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:12,958
I don't know what happened

268
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,958
between Sho and those
friends of yours,

269
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,583
but I know he isn't the one
who started all of this!

270
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,625
Can't you see he hasn't
done anything wrong?!

271
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,791
Shut up, you stupid bitch!

272
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,916
[APTOM] Sho! Look at me!

273
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,875
[SHO] Enzyme II!

274
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,458
[APTOM] Come on, boy. Let's see
you bioboost!

275
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,833
What's the matter?
Are you scared?

276
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,250
I thought you said you were
going to become the Guyver

277
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,166
so you could protect this girl!

278
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:46,541
G..Guyver!
[MIZUKI] Didn't work...

279
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,916
[APTOM] If you're going to
transform, you better hurry!

280
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,416
Because if you take too long,

281
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,666
I might just cut this poor
little girl to PIECES!

282
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,791
[Mizuki screams]

283
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,625
Leave her alone!

284
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,041
Sho! Please don't die!

285
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,500
[APTOM] You heard me, you
little shit! I said bioboost!

286
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,458
I'm not screwing around!

287
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,875
Mizuki...

288
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,916
Oh, Sho...

289
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,583
[APTOM]
This is your last chance.

290
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,000
You can sit there and watch me
tear her apart,

291
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,458
or you can roll over and
bleed to death.

292
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,833
But either way,

293
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,041
you're both as good as dead
if you don't transform!

294
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,500
So, come on Fukamachi!
What's it gonna be?

295
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:34,708
[SHO] <i>Power... I need power...</i>
<i>enough to save Mizuki.</i>

296
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,916
<i>I want the Guyver's power!</i>

297
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,083
[FUMIO] Sho...

298
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,458
I understand.

299
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:55,208
[APTOM] Come on Sho! Bioboost!
Become the Guyver!

300
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,125
Embrace your hatred!

301
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:00,291
GUYVER!

302
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,958
YES! THAT'S IT!

303
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:18,791
You're okay!

304
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,000
[SHO] If the Guyver has caused
these problems,

305
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,291
then the Guyver
will settle them!

306
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:33,083
Now, it's just you and me! Let's
go, Aptom! Come and get me!

307
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,000
[APTOM] Running already?

308
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:40,583
[MIZUKI] Even after all that,
he became the Guyver.

309
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,125
He did it... for me.

310
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,541
[MIZUKI]
<i>He wanted to protect me.</i>

311
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:56,000
<i>Oh, Sho...</i>

312
00:17:56,083 --> 00:18:00,000
[APTOM] Get back here!
[SHO] Just like before!

313
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,583
[APTOM] Surprised? Now that I've
been reoptimized,

314
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:07,166
I can mimic far more
than appearances!

315
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,458
[SHO] A Gregole?!
[APTOM] With only a small cell

316
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,625
sample, I can self-optimize
into any Zoanoid type!

317
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,000
Possess any Zoanoid Power!

318
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,750
[Sho grunts in pain]

319
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:25,291
[Aptom laughs]

320
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,875
[SHO] Vamore!

321
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,958
Too powerful...

322
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,291
[APTOM] Nice dodge. You've
improved.

323
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,250
But I wouldn't have it
any other way!

324
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,583
If I was able to finish
you off that easily,

325
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,166
then I'd be disappointed!

326
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,166
After all, I won't be able to
avenge Somlum and Dyme

327
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,416
unless I can really
make you suffer!

328
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,833
You know, we Lost Numbers were
just outcasts at Chronos.

329
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,041
Those twisted bastards only kept
us alive

330
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,250
to use us as human guinea pigs!

331
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,666
We had not only lost our pride
as Zoanoids,

332
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,708
but were robbed of our
human dignity!

333
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,541
Our only consolation was the
bond we shared through the

334
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,041
terrible circumstances that
brought us together!

335
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,625
And then you... you crushed my
friends

336
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:14,041
as if they were worms
beneath your feet!

337
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,875
[SHO] Is that why you went
against Chronos' orders

338
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,500
and let Mizuki and me escape?

339
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,291
Because you wanted to kill me
yourself?

340
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,083
Because you wanted to avenge
your comrades?

341
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,416
[Sho screams in pain]

342
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,583
[APTOM] Oh, you protected your
mega-smasher, huh?

343
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,083
Nice try, but with your arms
like that,

344
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,041
I'd like to see you
try and use it!

345
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,625
It's over, you're finished!

346
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,291
[ZX-TOLE] You said Guyver I
showed up?

347
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,875
I thought the report said it
was Guyver III.

348
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,500
It's definitely Guyver I, Sir.

349
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,041
At present, he's engaged
in combat with a Zoanoid.

350
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,333
There's only one, but somehow
it's overpowering him!

351
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,125
A single Zoanoid beating the
Guyver?! That's absurd!

352
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,291
What type is it?

353
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,583
What? You don't know?!

354
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,291
To tell the truth, Sir, I've
never seen this type before.

355
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,833
[APTOM] Huh?

356
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,708
[SOLDIER] Present location is...

357
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,083
[Aptom roars]
[Soldier cries out and dies]

358
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,416
[APTOM] Damn it! Now it's only a
matter of time

359
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,916
before those four elites
find their way here.

360
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,958
I don't know what you think
you're trying to pull,

361
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,791
but I m running out of time.

362
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,750
So die, Guyver!

363
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,000
[SHO] C'mon Smasher... OPEN!

364
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,500
[APTOM]
His armor, it opened on its own!

365
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:34,708
[Aptom roars in pain]

366
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,666
[ELEGEN] What the hell was that?

367
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,916
[ZX-TOLE] Move out!

368
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,458
[OTHERS] Right!

369
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:06,166
[SHO] <i>I'm sorry, Dad. I won't</i>
<i>run away any more.</i>

370
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,458
<i>I promise I'll never forget</i>
<i>your sacrifice.</i>

371
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,166
<i>And I'll take responsibility</i>

372
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,041
<i>for getting everyone wrapped</i>
<i>up in this mess.</i>

373
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,291
<i>I will fight this fate to the</i>
<i>bitter end,</i>

374
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:21,541
<i>together with this Guyver.</i>

375
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:26,750
<i>So please, watch over me,</i>
<i>Dad, together with Mom.</i>

376
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,250
[Aptom chuckles]
How interesting,

377
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,833
that was a nice move,

378
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,958
but it looks like this body of
mine isn't ready to give up yet!

379
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:32,125
[NARRATOR]
A terrifying evolution leads to

380
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,875
the birth of a horrifying
new "Battle Creature."

381
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:37,375
Underestimating his
own creation,

382
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,625
Dr. Barcas unwittingly paves the
way for Aptom's rampage.

383
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:45,541
Meanwhile, Sho and Mizuki
retreat to a nearby village,

384
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:46,833
in an attempt to escape

385
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:50,916
from Chronos' overwhelming
sphere of influence.

386
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,625
Next time:
"Nightmarish Encirclement"
