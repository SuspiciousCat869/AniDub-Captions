1
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,500
Do you think you're
gonna be all right?

2
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,375
Yeah, I'm feeling better now.

3
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,416
There's something you
should know, Murakami.

4
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,666
The Relic was creating a
sort of resonance with you

5
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,333
and Guyot's Zoacrystals.

6
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,291
You see, it appears to
have helped you recover

7
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,000
from your coma.

8
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,250
We won't know the full details

9
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,583
until we conduct
an investigation,

10
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,916
but the outlook
seems good for now.

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,708
Well, I can't complain.

12
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,083
But still, you should
take it easy.

13
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,916
Your body needs time to recover.

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,541
And as long as you're down here,

15
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,625
you won't have to worry about
any attacks from Chronos.

16
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,583
Yeah, but this is strange.

17
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,208
Relic's Point's
probably the last place

18
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,333
I'd expect to use
as a secret base.

19
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,666
Well, lucky for us,

20
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,333
I'm sure Guyot's thinking
the exact same thing.

21
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,875
Yeah, I have to admit, this is
one hell of a blind spot.

22
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:09,625
God help me! [screams]

23
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,541
[APTOM]
<i>Well, this has been fun,</i>

24
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,375
<i>but no matter how many</i>
<i>low-level Zoanoids I absorb,</i>

25
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,083
<i>I'm not going to get any</i>
<i>stronger than I am now.</i>

26
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,125
<i>If I want to defeat</i>
<i>the Guyvers,</i>

27
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,375
<i>I'll have to prey on something</i>

28
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,291
<i>even more powerful</i>
<i>than a hyper-Zoanoid.</i>

29
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,083
<i>But what?</i>

30
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:36,500
A Zoalord... Guyot!

31
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,250
I guess it's worth a shot.

32
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,208
Tetsuro?

33
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,041
[TETSURO] What's wrong?
Couldn't sleep?

34
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,291
 I wanted to take a bath before
I went to bed,

35
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,125
but I don't know how to
work the controls.

36
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,416
[TETSURO] [chuckles] I see.

37
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,666
[MIZUKI] By the way, isn't
it kind of late at night

38
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,708
for you to be working?

39
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,333
As long as we're here,

40
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,875
I have to take every
opportunity I can

41
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:04,041
to look up information on
Chronos and the Creators.

42
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:07,083
It's just... I can't help
Sho out in a fight,

43
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,000
and even though I want
to cheer him up,

44
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,416
it's hard for me to talk to
him about his dad.

45
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,875
It may not be much, but
this is all I can do.

46
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,791
Tetsuro...

47
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:24,750
<i>Sho and Tetsuro are working so</i>
<i>hard, but it's not just them.</i>

48
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,291
<i>Everyone here is doing</i>
<i>their best.</i>

49
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,833
<i>They're putting everything</i>
<i>they've got into this.</i>

50
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,750
<i>But what am I doing?</i>

51
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,666
<i>I was so happy, I lost sight</i>
<i>of why we were here.</i>

52
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,291
<i>I'm such an idiot!</i>

53
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,750
<i>Everyone else is fighting</i>
<i>for their lives,</i>

54
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,458
<i>and I'm just sitting here!</i>

55
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,125
<i>I'm so pathetic...</i>

56
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,083
<i>I should be ashamed.</i>

57
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,750
Oh, Mizuki, you're
up early today.

58
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,916
I should be finished with
breakfast in just a minute,

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,500
but I have to take
Mr. Murakami his food

60
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,250
before I serve anyone else.

61
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:18,000
Is there anything I can do to
help you guys out?

62
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,083
It's okay.
I appreciate the thought,

63
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,166
but no need to trouble yourself.

64
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,083
[MIZUKI] But I WANT to help!

65
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,500
I've gotta do my best to
pitch in around here.

66
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,833
 Just like everyone else!

67
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,333
[SHO] You're looking a lot less
pale than you did yesterday.

68
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,875
That's a surprise, given how
much blood they've been taking.

69
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,916
I feel like a human pin cushion.

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,666
Sorry about that.

71
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,875
Fortunately, I think this
wraps it up.

72
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,583
You've been a good sport.

73
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,375
Thanks, I appreciate it.

74
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,291
Good morning, Mr. Murakami!

75
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,000
I brought you your breakfast.

76
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,583
Outta the way, Tetsuro.
[TETSURO] Wha...

77
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,750
I'll be taking care of you

78
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,416
while you're stuck
here in the infirmary.

79
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,708
So, if there's anything
you need, just ask.

80
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:04,375
Ah, shucks, but I don't want you
to hafta go any trouble for me.

81
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,250
No, please, by all means,
put her to work.

82
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,833
We need you in good shape ASAP.

83
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,333
Dr. Odagiri said we're having a
meeting the day after tomorrow

84
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,208
to put together a battle plan.

85
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,541
I see, so we're finally going
to make a move.

86
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,000
Well, I'm sure they've got
something cooked up.

87
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,333
Whatever it is,

88
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,958
I'm willing to bet it
involves Sho and Makishima

89
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,875
fighting some kind of
Zoanoid or something.

90
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,916
Sounds good.
You can count on me.

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,875
I mean, I know I've been running
away all this time,

92
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,708
but things are a lot
different now.

93
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,958
If I want to protect my friends,

94
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,166
I'm gonna have to
stand up and fight.

95
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,000
If I think about it that way,
then I can definitely do this.

96
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:41,416
Oh, Sho...

97
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,000
Sho's gotten pretty tough.
I'm impressed.

98
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,125
He's gotta work
hard if he wants to

99
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,750
make an impression
on a girl like you.

100
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,833
Come on, it's not like that!

101
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,500
You're childhood friends, right?

102
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,458
Right.

103
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,916
It's kinda funny, but Sho was
a real wimp back then,

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,750
even I could beat him up.
[MURAKAMI] Yeah?

105
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,250
[MIZUKI] But he's always
been like that.

106
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,541
He's almost like a
girl sometimes.

107
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,166
I mean, he's really
sensitive, he can't fight

108
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,125
and he likes taking care
of flowers and stuff.

109
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,291
It seems kinda funny now,

110
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,041
but I've always been
into sports,

111
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,583
so I liked althletic-type guys

112
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,166
and thought guys like
Sho were dorky.

113
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,250
Then I guess I'm a dork too.

114
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,125
I always hated playing sports.

115
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,750
I just enjoyed looking after the
animals at my school.

116
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,875
Even during the summer, I'd come
every day to take care of them.

117
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,125
But it was kind of sad, because
if one of them died,

118
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,541
I'd be crying about
it for days.

119
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,333
That's really weird.

120
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,750
That doesn't sound like the
Murakami I know at all.

121
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,208
[MURAKAMI] Funny, huh?

122
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,583
Everyone used to just
call me "Crybaby."

123
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,500
Sho's a lot stronger than we
give him credit for.

124
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,750
He may even be strong enough
to take down Chronos.

125
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,458
[MIZUKI] You think so?

126
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,250
I have absolute faith in Sho.

127
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,666
[MURAKAMI] Sho's a lot stronger
than we give him credit for.

128
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,125
He's right.

129
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,583
[MIZUKI] Oh, I... I was just
thinking that you and Sho

130
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,208
were really strong, you know?

131
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,916
I want to be like that too.

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,875
I'm not really that strong.

133
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:13,416
Back when I first met you, you
said you'd protect Makishima.

134
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,541
I don't think I can do
as much as you,

135
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:20,333
so knowing that, I don't want to
be a burden to Sho.

136
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,125
I just have to help him
any way I can.

137
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,041
[GUYOT] Shirai!

138
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,750
Shirai!

139
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,666
Uh, yes I'm right here, Sir!
 How can I help you?

140
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,833
[GUYOT]
You can help me

141
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,208
by getting the Remover
working, you fool!

142
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,791
Ah, yes, actually it's funny
you mention that,

143
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,750
because when the Relic
was resonating,

144
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,125
the Remover was reacting with
sort of a strange glow.

145
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,458
In fact--
Spare me the details,

146
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,625
just do it!

147
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:51,458
<i>I need a working Remover now!</i>
<i>I'm running out of time!</i>

148
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,583
<i>Indeed, it may be too</i>
<i>late already.</i>

149
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,333
<i>I know Barcas is onto me.</i>
<i>It's only a matter of time</i>

150
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:00,125
<i>before he reports this</i>
<i>to the Arizona base.</i>

151
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:05,291
<i>And when he does, they'll come,</i>
<i>the Twelve Zoalords!</i>

152
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,250
[SIN] Gentlemen, the emergency
summons we received

153
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,833
was sent by none other than
Barcas the Elder.

154
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:15,458
He reports that Richard Guyot is
plotting to overthrow us.

155
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,833
[KRUMEGGNIC] What?!
[JEARVILL] That's absurd!

156
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,958
[SIN] It came as a shock
to me as well,

157
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,625
but apparently he plans to
challenge Archanfel

158
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,916
in an attempt to usurp
the council.

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,666
[ENZI] The man must be
out of his mind.

160
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,333
Only a lunatic would
oppose Archanfel.

161
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,416
[KRUMEGGNIC] Indeed.

162
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,291
[WAFELDANOS] I'd like
to see him try.

163
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,916
[CABLARL] It's not so
surprising.

164
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,125
We must remember that

165
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,458
Guyot was the last of us
to become a Zoalord.

166
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,583
He's not had the opportunity
to meet Archanfel.

167
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,666
[PURG'STALL] Yes, and even we
haven't seen Archanfel in years.

168
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,291
He doesn't appear unless he
deems it absolutely necessary.

169
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,791
[SIN] Guyot is a fool to think
him a mere Zoalord.

170
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,791
He is the founder of Chronos
and our rightful ruler.

171
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:56,041
His power extends far beyond
Guyot's imagination.

172
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,041
The world trembles beneath
his feet,

173
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,541
and even we bow in his presence.

174
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:05,166
Guyot has sealed his fate.
This is the end.

175
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,750
Good morning, Murakami!

176
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,583
I'm here to change your sheets.

177
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,375
Would you mind getting out
of bed for a moment?

178
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,666
Thanks, but I think I can
handle it myself.

179
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,458
You should rest!

180
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,000
[MURAKAMI] I really can't keep
troubling you like this.

181
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,458
Don't worry, it's no
trouble at all.

182
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,708
We're all doing whatever
we can,

183
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:28,916
and even if this isn't much,

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,291
it's the best I
can do right now.

185
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,958
Uh, I don't mean it like
you're not important.

186
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,458
No, I understand.

187
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:39,875
I'll get up so you can
change the sheets.

188
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,500
Hold on, I'll be back in a
second with your breakfast.

189
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:43,708
You know, I think
you're the reason

190
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,916
I've been able to
recover so fast.

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,583
Thanks a lot.

192
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,416
I haven't done much,
really, but thanks.

193
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,958
<i>Murakami's a really nice guy.</i>

194
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,750
<i>He kind of reminds me of</i>
<i>Sho in a way.</i>

195
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,208
<i>I'm glad we're getting</i>
<i>to be friends.</i>

196
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,916
[ODAGIRI] Could I speak with
you for a moment?

197
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,625
Sure, what is it, Doctor?

198
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,583
It's your exams.

199
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,916
We got the results back, and
I have some bad news.

200
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,541
[SHIRAI] Yes, perfect! My
hypothesis was correct!

201
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,166
The Relic was the missing
link after all!

202
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,500
The vibrations have awakened
the Remover!

203
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:31,291
I did it! At last, I've found a
way to activate the Remover!

204
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,375
[laughs insanely]

205
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,708
[MURAKAMI] You don't have to
put it gently.

206
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,500
I already have my suspicions.

207
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,208
[ODAGIRI] Listen, Murakami...

208
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,625
[MURAKAMI] It's all right,
I'm ready to accept it.

209
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:47,250
The truth is, I should have
died back in Arizona.

210
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,375
Really, it's a miracle
that a prototype like me

211
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,041
has managed to
survive this long.

212
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,875
So, go ahead and tell me, Doc.

213
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,666
I want to know how long I
still have before I die.

214
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,458
[Mizuki gasps]

215
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,750
About half a year at most.

216
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:06,083
And that's only on the condition
that you don't exert yourself.

217
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,166
Is it still possible for
me to transform?

218
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,166
[ODAGIRI] You don't mean you...

219
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,875
I imagine you could
do it once more,

220
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,875
but your lifespan will
be drastically reduced

221
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,041
in the process.

222
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,916
One more time, huh?

223
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,875
I think that should be enough.

224
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,708
I appreciate it, Doctor.

225
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,250
[ODAGIRI] I'm sorry.

226
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,041
[crash of falling objects]

227
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,833
I didn't know you were there.

228
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,500
I guess you overheard us,
didn't you?

229
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,500
Could you keep this a secret
from everyone else?

230
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:44,708
[MIZUKI] But...
[MURAKAMI] Please,

231
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,333
especially from Sho.

232
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:51,541
If he found out, he'd be worried
about placing a burden on me.

233
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,291
Then I'm afraid that he
wouldn't be able to fight

234
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,208
with all of his heart.

235
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,458
If that happened,
there'd be no reason for me

236
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,125
to have survived this long
in the first place.

237
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:04,000
So please, I'm begging you
not to say anything.

238
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,291
[MIZUKI] <i>It's just...</i>
<i>it's not fair.</i>

239
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,875
<i>He didn't ask for this!</i>

240
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:14,208
<i>He was just like anyone else,</i>
<i>just like Sho...</i>

241
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:26,416
Does that mean that someday
Sho's going to... [sobs]

242
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,208
What the heck is that?

243
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,458
[SOLDIER 2] It's coming
over here.

244
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,708
[ARCHANFEL] Are you soldiers
of the Japan Branch?

245
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,125
I suppose I have no choice now
that you've seen me.

246
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,166
[death screams &amp; gurgles]

247
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,333
[APTOM] <i>What the hell</i>
<i>is that guy?!</i>

248
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:13,833
[ARCHANFEL] Ah, looks like
I missed one.

249
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:17,000
Hm? My thought waves don't
seem to have an effect.

250
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,000
 You must not be a Zoanoid.

251
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,083
I did hear that all
manner of flawed creatures

252
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,833
were roaming about Japan.

253
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,500
[APTOM] <i>I can't believe it,</i>
<i>I'm actually scared!</i>

254
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,000
<i>This is the power I've</i>
<i>been longing for!</i>

255
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:41,125
Oh, I see, did you think you
could absorb me?

256
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:44,625
Call it a hunch, but I bet you
were made by Hamilcar.

257
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,958
He's going to be trouble if he
doesn't learn to clean up

258
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,375
after his experiments.

259
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,208
[SHIZU] Master Agito,
Dr. Odagiri wants to

260
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,541
gather everyone for a meeting.

261
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,541
[MAKISHIMA] So, it's time.

262
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,833
Hey, you're out of bed?
Are you feeling better already?

263
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:14,625
All better and ready to launch
our counter-attack.

264
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,041
[ODAGIRI] Ladies and gentlemen,
after years of anticipation,

265
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,958
the time is finally
ripe to execute

266
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,750
our overthrow of Chronos.

267
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,791
Albeit, with our limited
resources, it would be reckless

268
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,583
to launch a head-on attack
against a heavily armed base

269
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,541
such as this one.

270
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,000
Of course, this base was
constructed around a relic

271
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,958
left behind by the Creators.

272
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,875
The Relic itself is
a massive life form

273
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,833
once used for transportation.

274
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,458
It's the last operational
ship of its kind,

275
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,208
a sort of living fossil
left in stasis.

276
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,541
But if we were to somehow
activate it...

277
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:48,333
[MURAKAMI] Yes, then this base
will collapse on itself.

278
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,541
[ODAGIRI] Precisely, and that,
in effect, is our plan.

279
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,625
But... can we really do
something like that?

280
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,250
Is there some kind of cockpit
or control panel inside?

281
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,875
That... I'm afraid I don't know.

282
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:00,875
We haven't been able to

283
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,958
successfully enter
the Relic yet.

284
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,666
But that doesn't make any sense.

285
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,583
I mean, weren't the Guyver Units
taken from inside the Relic?

286
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,833
To put it more accurately,
perhaps I should say that

287
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:15,791
no one's ever entered
the Relic, and survived.

288
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,041
While impossible
for a normal human,

289
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:21,458
I believe a Guyver could search
within and return unharmed.

290
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,750
I see, so it's not just that the
units were found IN the Relic,

291
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,375
but that they have a specific
connection to one another.

292
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,708
The Creators were equipped with
Guyver Units, just like us.

293
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:34,375
That's correct, but that's all
just conjecture at this point.

294
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,750
In truth, we have no idea what
awaits you inside that ship.

295
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:41,250
Even bioboosted, I can't
guarantee your survival.

296
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:50,708
I realize it's a desperate plan
and knowing that, well...

297
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:55,208
We understand the risks every
time we engage our suits, Doc.

298
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,291
It's too late for me
to run away now.

299
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:01,041
Consider carefully.
Are you sure?

300
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,333
[MIZUKI] Stop it!
[TETSURO] Mizuki?

301
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:06,000
[MIZUKI] Think about what you're
saying! You might DIE!

302
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,791
You can't just agree to
something like that!

303
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,833
Mizuki...

304
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:14,791
[MIZUKI] Death is... it's a
really terrible thing, you know!

305
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,416
How can you all talk about it
like it's nothing?

306
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,250
Just stop!

307
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,541
I don't want you to go! I don't
want you to fight anymore!

308
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,250
Stop it!

309
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,500
[MIZUKI] I just...

310
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,041
 I'm sorry... [sobs]

311
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,041
[SHO] Mizuki, wait!

312
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,083
[SHIZU] I'll talk to her.

313
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,041
I didn't mean to...

314
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,291
[SHIZU] Mizuki...

315
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,125
[MIZUKI] I can't do it.

316
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:59,125
I tried so hard, but I just
can't be strong like you.

317
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,958
I'm just a burden to everyone.

318
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,958
[SHIZU] Really, I'm not
strong at all.

319
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,458
[MIZUKI] But you're able to
take care of Makishima.

320
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,958
[SHIZU] It's true that
I've committed myself

321
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,208
to looking after Master Agito.

322
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,416
I've done so
ever since that day,

323
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,750
and I probably will from
every day on.

324
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,166
I want to follow Master Agito

325
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,916
and protect him in
any way I can,

326
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,375
 for as long as I live.

327
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,250
[MIZUKI] See? You are strong
after all.

328
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,500
[SHIZU] You've seen the
path he's chosen.

329
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,458
The decisions he's made may
lead to his own destruction.

330
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,041
Don't say that!

331
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,458
Even knowing that, I'll
continue to follow him.

332
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,583
Even if I can, I won't
try to stop him.

333
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:41,333
Sometimes, I think it's better
not to be able to do anything.

334
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,583
I'd rather you just stay
like you are now,

335
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,083
protesting their fight
as much as you can.

336
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,000
It's something I don't have
the courage to do myself.

337
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,625
[MIZUKI] But no matter
what I say,

338
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm sure that Sho's
going to fight.

339
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,666
[SHIZU] Because he is a Guyver.

340
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,041
[MIZUKI] Then, if I can't
stop him from fighting,

341
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,666
the only thing I can do is
support him in his fight.

342
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:07,750
[GUYOT] Yes! At last, the
Remover is mine!

343
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:12,291
Now nothing can stand in my way!

344
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,916
[SIN] Well, gentlemen,
are you ready?

345
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,291
We must proceed to Japan

346
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,625
and dispose of Richard
Guyot immediately.

347
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:21,875
We cannot tolerate betrayal,
especially at a time like this.

348
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:26,083
Now that X-Day is upon us, we
must not deviate from our plan!

349
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,291
[MURAKAMI] Sho...

350
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,291
I'm counting on you to come
back alive, all right?

351
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,625
[SHO] Right!

352
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,833
Where did Mizuki run off to
this time? C'mon...

353
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,083
She really didn't want us to
go on this mission.

354
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,791
She's probably still
upset about it.

355
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,583
Well, this is no time for that!

356
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,875
Not when you're about to put
your life on the line!

357
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,666
Not when you might...

358
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,375
You better come back.

359
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,500
Don't worry, I'll be all right.

360
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,625
[MIZUKI] <i>I don't know</i>
<i>what to say.</i>

361
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:03,041
<i>I'm just...</i>
<i>so afraid of losing him.</i>

362
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,583
<i>I always took him for granted.</i>

363
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,083
<i>I always thought he'd be there.</i>

364
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,000
<i>We were that close.</i>

365
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,833
<i>So close it was a</i>
<i>pain sometimes.</i>

366
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,500
<i>I guess...</i>

367
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:18,083
<i>that's why I never realized</i>
<i>how much he means to me.</i>

368
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,083
Mizuki!

369
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,541
I'm glad you came
to see me off.

370
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,125
I thought you were angry at us.

371
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,958
Sho...

372
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,791
Sho, I'm sorry.

373
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,875
I can't cheer you on.

374
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,583
I just want you to come back,
please.

375
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:41,916
It's all right if the mission
fails, just come back safe.

376
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,750
You've got to...

377
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,958
I'll come back, I promise.

378
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,500
Please be careful.

379
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,291
I will.

380
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,708
[SHO] Guyver!
[MAKISHIMA] Bioboost!

381
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,250
Now that I finally have
the Remover,

382
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,875
I need a Guyver to
take control of.

383
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,083
Where could they be hiding?

384
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:16,541
Those thought waves!
What the hell is HE doing here?

385
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,250
[GUYOT] <i>This power... it's</i>
<i>overwhelming... terrifying!</i>

386
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,916
[ARCHANFEL] It's been a long
time, hasn't it, Richard?

387
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,125
Of course... I'm sure you
don't remember me,

388
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,541
seeing as the last time we met

389
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,166
you were still in your
optimization tank.

390
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,291
[GUYOT] <i>What? It can't be!</i>
<i>Archanfel?!</i>

391
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,833
[Aptom groans in pain]

392
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,916
[Aptom growls in anger]

393
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,416
[MAKISHIMA] Let's do this.
[SHO] Right!

394
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:32,166
[NARRATOR] With the arrival
of Archanfel,

395
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,083
Relic's Point is thrown
into chaos.

396
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,166
Unable to oppose the
Zoalord's strength

397
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,875
and unwilling to relinquish
the Remover,

398
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,291
Guyot lashes out in
desperate rage.

399
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,875
Meanwhile, the two Guyvers

400
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:46,166
venture to the depths
of the Relic,

401
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,458
unlocking an ancient power
that has been dormant

402
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:50,125
and buried for centuries.

403
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:53,125
What mysteries will
come to light?

404
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:56,833
Next time: "The Creators' Ship"
