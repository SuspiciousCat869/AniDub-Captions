Makishima!
[sounds of roof collapsing]

2
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,958
[ZX-TOLE] What?

3
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,125
Sho!

4
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:24,083
[ZX-TOLE] Looks like
you're just in time.

5
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,333
Now we can finish you
both off at once.

6
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,166
[MAKISHIMA]
Be careful, Guyver I.

7
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,208
They're not like anything
we've encountered so far.

8
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,750
[groans in pain]
[MIZUKI] Makishima!

9
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,000
[SHO] <i>Makishima?</i>

10
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,625
[THANCRUS] How dare you
turn your back on us?!

11
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:47,416
[THANCRUS]
You're quicker than I expected.

12
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,458
But not quick enough!

13
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,916
My blades vibrate at
an ultra-high frequency,

14
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,416
just like yours.

15
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,375
They can even cut bioboosted
armor to pieces!

16
00:02:56,458 --> 00:03:00,000
One touch and you're through!

17
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:05,875
[FUMIO] <i>Is that really Sho?</i>
<i>That... That thing?</i>

18
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,916
[MAKISHIMA] <i>This is looking bad.</i>
<i>If it keeps up like this,</i>

19
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,583
<i>I don't think we're</i>
<i>going to make it.</i>

20
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,916
[THANCRUS] Die!

21
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,208
[piercing high frequency whine]

22
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,541
[THANCRUS] What the hell?

23
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:23,541
I see, the frequencies are
reacting to each other.

24
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,000
[GASTER] Let me finish him off
with my projectiles.

25
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,333
I'll show you...

26
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,458
[high frequency blast]

27
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,125
[MAKISHIMA] Fukamachi! Let's go!

28
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,583
[SHO] Dad!
[GASTER] Oh, no you don't!

29
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,208
[high frequencey blast]

30
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,541
[MAKISHIMA] <i>Damn it, with the</i>
<i>condition I'm in now,</i>

31
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,625
<i>I can't attune myself</i>
<i>to his frequency</i>

32
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,791
<i>and get a good shot off.</i>

33
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,458
[SHO] All right,
hang on tight, Dad.

34
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,250
[FUMIO] Right...

35
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,625
[DERZERB] Get back here!

36
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,708
[Zoanoids in confusion]

37
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,250
[TETSURO] Did he make it?

38
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,000
[MAKISHIMA] It looks
like he escaped.

39
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,750
[SHO] <i>Thank God. That was close,</i>

40
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:12,333
<i>but I didn't think I'd be able</i>
<i>to get my dad back so soon.</i>

41
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:16,958
<i>Still, I bet this is a pretty</i>
<i>big shock for him...</i>

42
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,666
<i>...seeing me like this.</i>

43
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,041
[FUMIO] I think it's better
just to trust him.

44
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,833
I'm sure he'll open up and
talk to me some day.

45
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,458
I just have to be patient.

46
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,500
[SHO] <i>Even though he's been so</i>
<i>understanding of me,</i>

47
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:33,125
<i>all I've done is make him worry</i>
<i>by hiding the truth from him.</i>

48
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,083
[FUMIO] Sho...

49
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,166
[SHO] Yeah?

50
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,958
Well, I, uh... guess
that getup would

51
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,291
make it pretty hard
to go to school, huh?

52
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,625
[SHO] Uh, no, I can take
it off if I want.

53
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,791
Oh, that's right.
You can do that, can't you?

54
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,625
But I bet taking a
bath is tough.

55
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,333
[SHO] Yeah...

56
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:52,583
[FUMIO] <i>What the heck am I</i>
<i>saying? This is just silly.</i>

57
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,333
<i>Can't I think of something</i>
<i>more normal to talk about?</i>

58
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,791
<i>But what is normal anymore?</i>

59
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,458

<i>to say to a son</i>

60

<i>with those monsters?</i>

61
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,375
[SHO] <i>I wanna say something,</i>

62
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,125
<i>but what can you say</i>
<i>at a time like this?</i>

63
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,750
[MIZUKI] Sho! Mr. Fukamachi!

64
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:09,875
[SHO] They all made it!

65
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,000
[FUMIO] You two aren't hurt,
are you?

66
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,833
No, we're fine!

67
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,000
[SHO] <i>I'll talk to him</i>

68

<i>Now's not the best time...</i>
[MAKISHIMA] Fukamachi! Look out!

70
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,958
[Sho screams in agony]

71
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,458
[TETSURO] Sho!

72
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,916
[ELEGEN] You're not getting away
from us that easy, Guyver!

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
[Sho countinues to scream]

74
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,583
Sho!

75
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:38,541
[SHO] Dad... you gotta
get out of here!

76
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,500
Hurry! Get in the car!

77
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:54,916
[SHO] Tetsuro, don't worry,
you can trust him! Just go!

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
[ZX-TOLE] Dammit, you
ain't making this easy!

00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,625
[SHO] Dad!

00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,625
[Sho screams in pain]

00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,166
Sho! SHO!

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,541
My dad, no...
[MIZUKI] Mr. Fukamachi!

83
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,875
[Elegen laughs] You're finished!
[MURAKAMI] Damn it!

00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,875
[Elegen wails in pain]

85
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,000
[MAKISHIMA]
Don't be so careless.

86
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,833
[ELEGEN] <i>You still live?!</i>

87
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,250
[MAKISHIMA]
That's what you get

88
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,333
for underestimating the
Guyvers' regenerative powers.

89
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,583
With an injury like that,

90
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,791
you don't stand a chance
without your partners.

91
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:41,125
[MURAKAMI] <i>Not bad. He scared</i>
<i>them off with a simple bluff.</i>

92
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,291
[BARCAS] Then we've lost them?

93
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,291
[GUYOT] Yes, in fact, those
hyper-Zoanoid "elites"

94
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,541
you're so proud of have
come away injured.

95
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,666
If that's the worst
the Guyvers can do,

96
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,333
I don't think we have
much to worry about.

97
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,458
Half a day in the
optimization tanks,

98
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,166
and they'll be good as new.

99
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,708
Well, in any case, even if
they've slipped away for now,

100
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:09,041
I doubt very seriously they'll
be able to make it out of town.

101
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,458
[police sirens]

102
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,208
[MIZUKI] I can't believe it!

103
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,833
It looked like such
a bad wound too!

104
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,541
I bet If you hadn't fired your
mega-smasher just then

105
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,708
you probably would have
recovered even faster.

106
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,458
[MIZUKI] <i>Makishima, you did</i>
<i>it to save Sho, didn't you?</i>

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,625
Are... Are you okay?

108
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,750
Yeah, I'm actually more
concerned about Fukamachi,

109
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,458
since he's still unconscious.

110
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,958
[MIZUKI] But he'll be all right,
won't he?

111
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,708
I mean, he'll be back
to normal in no time,

112
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,625
just like Makishima, right?

113
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,625
[MAKISHIMA] Yeah. Hey, Segawa...

114
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,875
About that Murakami guy...
[TETSURO] Uh huh?

115
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,041
He seems to know an awful lot

116
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,166
about what's going
on, doesn't he?

117
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,291
Uh, I guess, but really I don't
know anything about him.

118
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,541
That gun of his makes me
kinda nervous.

119
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,041
[MURAKAMI] It's natural that
you should be suspicious,

120
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,625
but for now, your only choice
is to trust me.

121
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:14,625
Oh, uhm, I'm sorry. I guess you
did save us, didn't you?

122
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,375
[MURAKAMI] No, I understand.

123
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,916
Anyway listen, the police have

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,083
already cordoned
off the whole town.

125
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,458
They're being paid
off by Chronos,

126
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,500
so there's no point
in going to them.

127
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,500
Then how do we get out?

128
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,416
With the state Sho's in right
now, we're not going anywhere.

129
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,958
If we can, I'd like
to find someplace

130
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,708
to lay low for a while.

131
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,166
[MAKISHIMA] <i>If I'm going to</i>
<i>take advantage of Sho's power,</i>

132
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,291

<i>Segawas around.</i>

133
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,750
<i>The problem is,</i>

134
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,458
<i>I have to make sure this</i>
<i>guy doesn't get in the way.</i>

135
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:43,625
Excuse me...
[MURAKMAI] Is something wrong?

136
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:47,333
Let's get everyone in the car, I
know a place where we can hide.

137
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,208
Trust me.

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,916
[MAKISHIMA] <i>If he has some sort</i>
<i>of ulterior motive,</i>

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,583
<i>then I'll have to try and use</i>
<i>that to my advantage as well.</i>

140
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,041
[GUYOT] This is the
data on the Zoanoids

141
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,916
that were created at
the Japanese Branch.

142
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,958
[BARCAS] Rather interesting.

143
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,625
[GUYOT] It might not compare
to your work,

144
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:23,125
but the Japanese Branch was the
leader in Zoanoid development.

145
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,375
[BARCAS] It seems they
haven't been able to

146
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,250
locate the Guyvers yet.

147
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,166
It's only a matter of time
before we have them back.

148
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,791
After all, we have a
valuable hostage now.

149
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,791
With Sho Fukamachi's
father at our disposal,

150
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,083
he should fall right
into our hands.

151
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,291
[BARCAS]
Yes, but the question is,

152
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,250
how are we going to
utilize that hostage?

153
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,666
I think I've found an
amusing solution.

154
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:54,875
Dad! Where are you?! Da...

155
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,000
Over here! Help me Sho!

156
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,541
[Fumio screams]
[SHO] DAD!

157
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,000
Sho! Sho!

158
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,833
Where am I?

159
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,000
[SHIZU] So you're finally awake!

160
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,000
[SHO] Who are you?

161
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,083
So you're up already, huh?

162
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,125
My name's Shizu.
Nice to meet you.

163
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,500
Oh good! I thought I heard
you talking.

164
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,666
You should let the
others know too.

165
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,125
Sure, I'll do that now.

166
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,708
Um, where am I?

167
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,083
[YOHEI]
There's nothing to worry about.

168
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:40,083
This is a villa, or actually
more like a safe house

169
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,333
that Master Agito prepared
out here in the woods

170
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,666
in case he ever needed
to get away.

171
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,791
[SHO] A safe house?
[YOHEI] My name's Yohei Onuma.

172
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,916
I've been serving Master
Agito and his family

173
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,708
since he was a little boy.

174
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,083
These days my
granddaughter Shizu and I

175
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,416
help out by
maintaining the villa.

176
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:01,708
Sho!
[SHO] Tetsuro! Mizuki!

177
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,500
You were out so long we were
afraid you'd never get up!

178
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,833
Sorry, I'm all right now though.

179
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,708
I'm glad. We were worried
about you.

180
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,083
By the way, Shizu,

181
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,791
I didn't know you had
gotten certified as a nurse.

182
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:17,000
I thought that it might come in
handy if there was an emergency.

183
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,291
Yeah, good idea.

184
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,375
[TETSURO] Forget it!

185
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,416
Listen, I understand that you're
worried about your dad and all,

186
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,541
but you've gotta rest
a little longer.

187
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,750
Thanks to everyone's help,

188
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,750
you finally have a
chance to sit back

189
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,916
and recover from everything
that's been happening.

190
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,125
I know you have the will
to fight now,

191
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,083
but you've gotta build up
your strength!

192
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,375
Yeah, but what if something
happens to my dad?

193
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,000
Do you really think
you can rescue him

194
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,625
with the state you're in now?

195
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:47,125
Yeah, don't do anything
reckless, all right?

196
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,541
[MURAKAMI] <i>Why would he need to</i>
<i>prepare a safe house like this?</i>

197
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,041
<i>Who is he hiding from?</i>

198
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
[MIZUKI] Where's Makishima?

199
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,416
[SHIZU] Master Agito
doesn't usually have

200
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,166
anything to eat
in the evening,

201
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,416
especially if he has
something on his mind.

202
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,833
Well that can't be very good
for him, can it?

203
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,458
Hold on, I'll go get him.
[SHIZU] Don't trouble yourself.

204
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:23,083
I'll bring him some leftover
soup later tonight.

205
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,000
So did Sho agree to
sit tight for a while,

206
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,000
or did he try and take off?

207
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,958
Well, he doesn't really
speak his mind very much,

208
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,750
so I'm not sure how he feels.

209
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,291
He took some sleeping pills
though, so he's out for now.

210
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:39,000
I'll try to keep an eye on him,
just in case.

211
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,666
Hey, you should watch
out too, Mizuki.

212
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:47,291
Are you listening?
[MIZUKI] Huh? Oh, uh, right.

213
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,125
[MIZUKI] Soup's not going
to be enough for him!

214
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,000
After all, he's got to
keep his strength up

215
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,708
in case he ends up in another
fight with those monsters.

216
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,750
Shizu probably doesn't
know what's going on.

217
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,000
He needs all the help
he can get.

218
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,916
[SHIZU] The bruise is
starting to heal up,

219
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,041
but I'll put another compress
on it just in case.

220
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:37,166
[MIZUKI] <i>There's no reason for</i>
<i>me to be running away really.</i>

221
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,791
<i>But somehow...</i>

222
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,208
<i>I just...</i>

223
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:45,375
<i>I don't know.</i>

224
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,708
[TETSURO] That's quite a gun
you've got there!

225
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,791
Yeah? Wanna take a look?

226
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,500
Yeah! Sure!

227
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,416
[MURAKAMI]
It's a modified .44 Magnum

228
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,458
that fires 12-gauge
dum-dum rounds.

229
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,666
Meaning, that the ammo holds

230
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,916
seven times the normal
amount of gunpowder.

231
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,875
It does some serious damage.

232
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,250
[TETSURO]
<i>How the heck did he end up</i>

233
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,916
<i>with a crazy weapon like</i>
<i>that in the first place?</i>

234
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,750
[MURAKAMI] You all right?
[TETSURO] Oh, uh sure...

235
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:13,000
[TETSURO] I think I'm gonna go
to bed though. See you tomorrow.

236
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,958
You think you'll be able
to sleep like this?

237
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,416
I think so. I mean
there's no guarantee

238
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,666
that Sho won't take
off on his own.

239
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,416
I've gotta keep an eye
on him, right?

240
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,375
[MIZUKI] Still, I wonder if
Mr. Fukamachi's okay?

241
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,250
[TETSURO] Yeah, I'm really
worried about him,

242
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,958
but dwelling on things like
that won't change anything.

243
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,458
That goes for you too.
[MIZUKI] Yeah, I know.

244
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,541
I mean Makishima.

245
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,791
Don't let his relationship
with Shizu get to you.

246
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,708
Wh..What do you mean?
Where did you get that from?

247
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,791
I... Th..That doesn't
bother me at all!

248
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,333
Shh!
[MIZUKI] Really!

249
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,875
Who would worry about that
at a time like this?

250
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,083
Wait, where are you going now?

251
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:55,000
[MIZUKI] I'm taking a bath.

252
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,166
[MIZUKI]
Yeah, I get it, all right?

253
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,875
I know what's going
on between them,

254
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,416
but I'm not letting
it get to me.

255
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,833
I'm not letting it
bother me one bit!

256
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,791
[YOHEI] Master Agito,

257
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,500
I cashed in part of your
remaining shares of stock,

258
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,541
just like you asked.

259
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,708
It should be enough to last you
for a while at least.

260
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,083
[MAKISHIMA]
I really appreciate it, Yohei.

261
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,416
[YOHEI] Think nothing of it.

262
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,583
[MAKISHIMA]
As always, I'm grateful

263
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,375
for all you and Shizu
have done for me.

264
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,541
[YOHEI]
Please, don't flatter me.

265
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,333
I owe your parents a
debt of gratitude

266
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,375
that I'll never be
able to repay.

267
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,166
It's my pleasure to do
whatever I can for you,

268
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,291
and I intend to do so for
the rest of my life.

269
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:39,125
I've brought Shizu up with
instructions to do the same.

270
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,541
Shizu was only about six when
she first came to our house,

271
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,666
wasn't she?

272
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,625
Yes, Sir. After she
lost her parents,

273
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,708
it was very kind of your
father to take her in

274
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,875
and treat her like
his own daughter.

275
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,166
You two were quite the pair!

276
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,583
I imagine we caused you
a lot of trouble.

277
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:56,208
It's only natural for
kids that age.

278
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:59,291
Agito, for Shizu's sake,
and for my sake

279
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,875
there's something I'd
like to ask of you.

280
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,458
That's rare.
You don't ask for much.

281
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:07,750
Don't take revenge.
It's not worth it.

282
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,541
This...
[SHIZU] It's Master Agito

283
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,000
when he was a child.

284
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,583
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should have asked first. Here.

285
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,041
[SHIZU] Don't worry about it.

286
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,208
So, I guess you and Makishima

287
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,083
have been together since you
were both really little?

288
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:29,750
Yes, I really miss those days.

289
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,375
Until HE came...

290
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,875
[YOHEI] Sir, why?

291
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,625
Why would you let a man like
that adopt the young master?

292
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,208
You aren't going to let him take
over this house, are you?

293
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,583
Please, say something! How can
you do this to your own son?!

294
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:46,291
[YOHEI] I hate Genzo Makishima
for what he did.

295
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,000
I hate him for
cornering your father

296
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,875
and taking over the household.

297
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,708
And more than anything else,

298
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:55,666
I hate him for driving your
parents to an early grave!

299
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,958
I despised that wicked man so
much I wanted to kill him.

300
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:02,291
Believe me when I tell you
I understand how you feel.

301
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:06,125
But it's all over now.
He's already dead!

302
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:09,958
So please, you don't need
to do this anymore.

303
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:10,875
[MAKISHIMA] That's enough.

304
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,625
Even if I wanted
to give this up,

305
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,416
Chronos would never let me go.

306
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,208
[YOHEI] Then run where they
can't reach you!

307
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,583
[MAKISHIMA]
I'm afraid that's not possible.

308
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,666
Chronos has branches all
over the world.

309
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,708
There's nowhere for me to run.

310
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,833
[YOHEI] Master Agito...

311
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,500
[MAKISHIMA] You said this
was for Shizu's sake too,

312
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,250
didn't you?

313
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,875
Is this how she feels?

314
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:32,333
Well, she, uh...
[MIZUKI] Shizu, wait.

315
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,416
Then you mean you already
knew that Makishima was trying

316
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,583
to overthrow Chronos
before all this?

317
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:37,833
[SHIZU] That's right.

318
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,666
[MIZUKI] And you know
all about the fights?

319
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,500
Then, aren't you worried
about him?

320
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,625
I'm sure Master Agito
will be fine.

321
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:53,291
Shizu, are you and
Makishima, uhm...

322
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,583
[MIZUKI] I mean, do you...

323
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:59,791
[YOHEI] Master Agito!
Don't look! Agito!

324
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:03,958
Come on, let's go!
It's all right...

325
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,875
[SHIZU] Master Agito!

326
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,458
[Shizu gasps]

327
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:18,375
[SHIZU] Master Agito! Wha?!

328
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,458
All I want is to be able
to protect Agito.

329
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,166
That's the only thing
that matters to me.

330
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,041
[MIZUKI] Protect him?
[SHIZU] No matter what.

331
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,500
I can't... compete with that.

332
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:42,041
[MAKISHIMA] Yohei, the truth is
things have changed.

333
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,291
I'm no longer interested in
something as petty as revenge.

334
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,958
[YOHEI] What then?!

335
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,041
I realized that Genzo was
nothing more than a pawn

336
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,708
in a much greater scheme.

337
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,208
Chronos is the true enemy.

338
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,166
It was their power
that moved him.

339
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,000
They're the ones who
killed my parents.

340
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,208
In this world,
power is everything.

341
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,291
Before that,
revenge is meaningless.

342
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,791
That's why I will
obtain power so great

343
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,916
that I will never
again be manipulated

344
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,583
by the ambitions of others.

345
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,541
I will rise above all authority.

346
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,166
And I will stop at nothing
to do so.

347
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,583
Guyver, Chronos and
everything else in this world

348
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,083
are nothing but tools.

349
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,750
I will use them as I please!

350
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,333
Master Agito...

351
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,458
[MAKISHIMA] <i>I am Zeus.</i>

352
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,541
<i>I am the god who will</i>
<i>rule this world!</i>

353
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,833
[SHIZU] <i>I knew that the tears</i>
<i>you cried that night</i>

354
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,833
<i>were not tears of sorrow,</i>

355
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:42,833
<i>but tears of frustration,</i>
<i>tears of helplessness.</i>

356
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:46,625
<i>Even back then, I knew the path</i>
<i>that you would take.</i>

357
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:50,125
<i>And so I decided</i>
<i>my path as well.</i>

358
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,083
<i>Don't be afraid, Master Agito.</i>

359
00:19:56,541 --> 00:20:02,041
<i>I promise I'll protect you,</i>
<i>until the end.</i>

360
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,500
[GUYOT] Good news.

361
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,166
We found where the
little rats are hiding.

362
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,666
[BARCAS] Oh?
[GUYOT] I imagine it won't be

363
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,916
long before they
make their move.

364
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,333
So how's it coming?

365
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,958
Almost according to plan.

366
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,458
We're missing a
large amount of data

367
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,166
pertaining to the
original Enzyme.

368
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,583
So this one's just become
one of my new designs.

369
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,958
Interesting. I can't wait
to see it in action.

370
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,750
[a child sobbing]

371
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,750
[FUMIO] Sho, you were playing
with my razor, weren't you?

372
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,666
Don't hide in the closet
like that, all right?

373
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,750
Now come on out.

374
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:47,208
Were you afraid I was going
to be mad at you?

375
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:51,166
Is that it? Because I bet you're
actually glad I found you.

376
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,666
I'm sorry, Dad.
[FUMIO] You let me know right

377
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,875
away if anything ever
happens to you.

378
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,041
[SHO] <i>That's right...</i>

379
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,958
<i>I was really happy when</i>
<i>Dad found me back then,</i>

380
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:05,166
<i>and I feel the same way now.</i>

381
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,000
<i>Why did I try to hide</i>
<i>things from him?</i>

382
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,666
<i>I'm sorry, Tetsuro,</i>
<i>but I can't wait.</i>

383
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,583
<i>I have to go rescue</i>
<i>my dad right now.</i>

384
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,333
Guyver!

385
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:30,083
[SHO] <i>Someone's following me.</i>
<i>A Zoanoid? No, who is it?</i>

386
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:36,750
[SHO] Makishima?!

387
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,666
[MAKISHIMA] Let me help you out.

388
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,750
[MAKISHIMA] To defeat Chronos

389
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:44,166
your strength is
absolutely necessary.

390
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,291
I can't just stand back and
watch you dig your own grave.

391
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,625
Let's go together.
To Mount Minakami...

392
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,208
[SHO] Right...

393
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,000
[NARRATOR] Makishima is forced
to face the staggering power

394
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:34,666
of the elite hyper-Zoanoids
once again.

395
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,041
In the desperate struggle,

396
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:39,250
Murakami reveals a
glimpse of his powers.

397
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,916
Meanwhile, a ruthless
plan is devised

398
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,375
to take advantage of the bond
between father and son.

399
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:48,583
Sho's reunion with Fumio
is short-lived,

400
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:53,083
as Barcas' psychic powers induce
a horrific transformation.

401
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:56,458
Next time:
"The Tragic Enzyme-2"
