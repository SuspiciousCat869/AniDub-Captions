[MAKISHIMA] <i>I'm sensing</i>

[BARCAS] It vanished!

00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,333
[TV] This evening at
approximately 10:00 pm,

18
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:33,250
a state of martial law was
announced over Tokyo.

19
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,041
[TETSURO] He fell!

20
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,750
Behind that building, right?

21
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,125
I know a shortcut. Follow me!

22
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,458
The Regulation Bureau
has mobilized

23
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:47,708
an elite squad of Zoanoids to
suppress the terrorist group,

24
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:52,166
but as of yet they have been
unable to do their job.

25
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,333
[NATSUKI] Should be right
around here. There we go!

26
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,291
Sho!

27
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,250
What the...

28
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,208
That isn't Fukamachi, is it?

29
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,291
No, it's not. What the hell?

30
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:12,250
I... I don't know who that is.

31
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,458
[NATSUKI] What is he?
Some kind of Zoanoid?

32
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:19,041
[TETSURO] I dunno. I've never
seen one like this before.

33
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,583
But whatever he is,

34
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,583
I'm sure he's one of the two
that were fighting in the sky.

35
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,083
[MIZUKI] It's Aptom!

36
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,750
That's Aptom? It's
really him, huh?

37
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:37,958
[APTOM] Mizuki Segawa!

38
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,416
But why?

39
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,750
What are you doing roaming
around in a place like this?

40
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,041
That Zoanoid really did a
number on you!

41
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,541
What the heck happened?
Who was that?

42
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,916
It doesn't matter! Why do you
care what happens to me?

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,250
Get out of here while
you still can!

44
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,875
Think about it!

45
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,916
What happens if Chronos finds
out you're still alive?!

46
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,875
How did you know?

47
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,291
Hey! I remember! You're that...

48
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,833
You're that guy
with the sunglasses

49
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,208
that's always hanging
around the apartment!

50
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,208
Seriously?!

51
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,500
No way, don't tell me...

52
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,916
So, you've been watching over
us this whole time?

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,291
Get the hell out of here!

54
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,250
The way I see it, if
Fukamachi is still alive,

55
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,333
he'll come back to you
as soon as he can.

56
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,791
I figured, if I kept an
eye on you guys,

57
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,541
 sooner or later I'd run
into him too.

58
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,791
That's the only reason,
all right?

59
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,541
<i>We aren't alone.</i>

60
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:29,750
<i>Even after all this time, he</i>
<i>believes Sho is alive too.</i>

61
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,750
[APTOM] Listen, no matter what,

62
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,958
I can't have you fall
into Chronos' hands.

63
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,541
If that happens, or worse yet,

64
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,583
if those bastards
finish off the Guyver I,

65
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,708
Then I will... I will have
lost my purpose to live!

66
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,750
<i>Aptom...</i>

67
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,916
Go on and get the hell
out of here!

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,208
Stop standing there and
go, all right?!

69
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,750
He could be here any second!

70
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,666
Who will?

71
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,000
It's too late, damn it.

72
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,250
[ZX-TOLE] Well, well, well,

73
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,791
I come to finish off Aptom,
and look who I find!

74
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,250
Haven't seen you two
for a while!

75
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,750
Tetsuro...

76
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:14,125
You're ZX-Tole, aren't you?
That's right, you were

77
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,166
the leader of the
hyper-Zoanoid five.

78
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,208
[ZX-TOLE]
So you remember me, huh?

79
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,000
Well, don't run off.

80
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:24,333
 I'll deal with you as soon as
I'm finished with him.

81
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,458
[ZX-TOLE] After what you did
to my friends,

82
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,375
you should be grateful to have
such a merciful death.

83
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,791
There's no coming back
this time.

84
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,208
Die, Aptom!

85
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,708
What?

86
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,625
Whoah! What's that?!

87
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,083
[ZX-TOLE] It can't be...

[YOHEI] Is something wrong?

[SHIZU] Grandfather,
it's Master Agito.

[YOHEI] You can tell, can't you?

96

You two have always
been that way.

[MAKISHIMA] Where am I?
It looks like Shinjuku.

99
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,416
I see, I must have
somehow gotten dragged

100
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,333
into the chrysalis's
teleportation.

101
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,541
We were moving through some
strange subspace,

102
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,125
but I don't know why it took
us here of all places.

103
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,166
Makishima?!

104

[MAKISHIMA] Segawa?

105
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,208
[TETSURO] I knew it, you were
all right after all!

106
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:10,375
[MIZUKI] But wait, what about
Sho? Is he with you?

107
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,666
[MAKISHIMA] Actually,
Fukamachi's inside that thing.

108
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,000
But how? I don't get it.

109
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,125
I don't get it either.
Makishima!

110
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,833
What is this weird thing?
What the heck happened to Sho?

111
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,416
[MAKISHIMA] We'll talk later.

112
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,250
Since this bastard doesn't
know when to die,

113
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,666
it looks like I'll have
to show him.

114
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,625
[ZX-TOLE] You've got nothing to
back up that tough talk now.

115
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,666
No matter, I'm actually
happy to see you.

116
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,291
I was hoping you were
still alive.

117
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,458
Now I have a chance to
avenge Thancrus too.

118
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:43,833
After I destroy you and finish
off what's left of Aptom,

119
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:47,583
all four of my friends can
finally rest in peace.

120
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,708
I've waited a long time
for this day!

121
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,458
Let's go, Guyver III!

122
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,583
[MAKISHIMA] Come and get me!

123
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,583
[MIZUKI]
Is Sho really inside this thing?

124
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:07,166
Sho, can you hear me?

125
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,750
If you're in there,
please answer me.

I knew it! It's Master Agito!

00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,291
He's all right after all!

131
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:46,666
I'm sorry I ever doubted
you, Agito!

[ZX-Tole growls in frustration]

Stop running and fight
like a man!

134
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,166
[Makishima cries out]

135
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,208
He's stronger than I expected.
It looks like he's got the power

136
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,250
of all five elite
hyper-Zoanoids.

137
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,583
Actually, he may be as strong as
all of them combined.

138
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:26,041
Look at him, making such an
outrageous spectacle out there.

139
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,833
But since he's the only one
suited to dealing with Aptom,

140
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,875
we can't risk getting involved.

141
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,125
I'm still uneasy about ZX-Tole
becoming a Lost Number.

142
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,791
If he decides to act on his own,

143
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:39,708
I won't be able to control
him with my thought waves.

<i>do with that power?</i>

146
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,458

<i>in the process of hunting</i>

149
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,708
<i>But in ZX-Tole's case,</i>

150
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,916
<i>with the stress of his</i>
<i>rushed optimization,</i>

00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,041
I want to know the
situation at the scene.

158
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,250
Send out scouts immediately.

159
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,083
Yes, Sir!

160
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,666
[ZX-TOLE]
You're not getting away!

161
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,416
[Makishima cries out]

162
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,166
Damn you!

163
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,458
[ZX-TOLE] You're not looking
so hot, Guyver III.

164
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,833
Where's the bravado?

165
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,583
[MAKISHIMA] <i>I need to buy</i>
<i>some time to use my smasher.</i>

166
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,291
I can't believe this.

167
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,708
It looks like even Guyver III
is no match for that thing!

168
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,583
[Aptom falls to the ground]

169
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,500
Here, give me your hand!

170
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,500
[TETSURO] Aptom?

171
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,375
[APTOM] That guy's just
too damn strong.

172
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:51,083
I hate to say it, but he even
gives me the chills.

173
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,958
What are you trying to do?

174
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,375
[APTOM]
I'm gonna give the Guyver III

175
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,375
a chance to use
his mega-smasher.

176
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,500
Because I can't afford to
die, not yet at least.

177
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,875
Aim for his blind spot!

178
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,125
[ZX-Tole grunts]

179
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,875
That bastard doesn't know
when to die!

180
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,583
[MAKISHIMA] Now!
[ZX-TOLE] What?!

181
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,041
[ZX-TOLE] I don't think so!

182
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,958
[Makishima lets out
a battle cry]

183
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,958
Did he block it?

184
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:29,458
He used his electo-wave knife to
split the mega-smasher in two!

185
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,916
[ZX-Tole lets out a battle cry]

186
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,291
[Makishima grunts in pain]

187
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,916
[SHIZU] Master Agito!

188
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,583
[ZX-Tole laughs]

189
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:44,541
It looks like I've finally
caught you, boy.

190
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:48,625
I have to admit, this has been a
lot more fun than I expected.

191
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,333
But it can't last forever!

192
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,333
[Makishima cries out in pain]

193
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,083
[SHIZU] NO!

194
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:59,166
Master Agito!

195
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,833
[TETSURO] Makishima!
[NATSUKI] Makishima, no!

196
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,666
Master Agito!
Please, say something!

197
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,333
Agito, please!

198
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,958
[Shizu sobs softly]

199
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:13,000
I always believed I'd see
you again someday.

200
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,958
And we'd be together forever.

201
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,041
[ZX-TOLE]
I think I know just the way

202
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,250
to finish you
off, Guyver III!

203
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:31,208
I'm gonna cleave you in half,
just like you did to Thancrus!

204
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,875
Shizu, no! Get outta the way!

205
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,000
ZX-Tole!
[ZX-TOLE] Enough rat!

206
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,208
[ZX-TOLE] One down.

207
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,666
<i>Sho...</i>

208
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:53,708
[ZX-TOLE] Out of my way,
little girl. Or else...

209
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,333
Stop it.

210
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,333
Shizu!

211
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,666
I won't let you lay a finger
on Master Agito!

212
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,000
Even if it kills me,
I won't move!

213
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,666
[ZX-TOLE] So be it.

214
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,916
<i>Sho, please!</i>

215
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,333
[ZX-TOLE]
If you want to die together,

216
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,458
then together you shall die!

217
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,458
SHO!

218
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,041
[SHIZU] Master Agito!

219
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,666
That's a Guyver, right?

220
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,916
Incredible...

221
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,250
He made it...

222
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,416
[TETSURO] It's huge!

223
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,625
[NATSUKI] Is that thing...
[MIZUKI] Yes, it's Sho.

224
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,125
[TETSURO] Are you sure?

225
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,291
There's no doubt in my mind.

226
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,166
I know because,
he answered my call.

227
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:27,625
Right, Sho? That's why
you're here, isn't it?

228
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:31,083
[ZX-TOLE]
That's Guyver I? Ridiculous!

229
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,625
Take this!

230
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,333
[TETSURO] Mizuki, run!

231
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,500
It's all right!
He'll protect us!

232
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,333
Help us, Sho!

233
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,083
[ZX-TOLE] W..What the hell?

234
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,625
There, see?

235
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:02,958
[ZX-TOLE] A barrier? Since when
can the Guyver use barriers?

236
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,833
What is that thing?!

237
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,666
I don't care who you are!
No one can stop me now!

238
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,291
[ZX-Tole lets out a battle cry]

239
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:26,625
You son of a bitch!
This isn't over yet!

240
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,500
It'll take a lot more than
that to beat me!

241
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,833
<i>How could that be the Guyver I?</i>

242
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,833
<i>He should have been obliterated</i>
<i>at Mount Minakami.</i>

243
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,250
<i>More than that, he</i>
<i>seems to have evolved</i>

244
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,791
<i>into something else entirely.</i>

245
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,500
<i>I'll have to go see for myself.</i>

246
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,666
<i>I'm concerned about ZX-Tole's</i>
<i>actions as well.</i>

247
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,250
<i>Dawn is breaking.</i>

248
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,916
<i>No! ZX-Tole wouldn't go</i>
<i>that far, would he?</i>

249
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,000
Stop this foolishness!

250
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,500
 Don't you know what will happen
if you release your power now?

251
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:22,291
[ZX-TOLE] Oh, I know. If I use
it now with the sun rising,

252
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,750
my blaster tempest will eclipse
even the Guyver's mega-smasher!

253
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,000
In fact, with this
much sunlight,

254
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,083
the intensity of the
beam will surpass

255
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,791
one hundred million degrees.

256
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,750
This is the true extent
of my power!

257
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,708
The Guyver will be
reduced to ash,

258
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,208
with all of Tokyo along
with him!

259
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:44,083
Of course, the beam will
destroy me as well,

260
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,208
but I'm willing
to pay that price.

261
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,583
I never had long to live anyway,

262
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,291
so I might as well go
out with a bang!

263
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,041
<i>Sho, please protect us!</i>

264
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:23,541
[ZX-TOLE] This is it!
The Final Blaster Tempest!

265
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,500
STOP IT!

266
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,833
[MIZUKI] <i>Don't give up.</i>

267
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,125
<i>I believe in you.</i>

268
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,416
<i>I still believe</i>
<i>that a light will</i>

269
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,375
<i>pierce the darkness</i>
<i>and drive it away.</i>

270
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,416
<i>I still believe...</i>

271
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,250
<i>that someday, we'll be</i>
<i>able to laugh again</i>

272
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,708
<i>under the clear, blue sky.</i>

273
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:03,375
<i>And I believe that the one who</i>
<i>carries that light is you, Sho.</i>

274
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,208
<i>You...</i>

275
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,500
It's over.

276
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,833
[low growling]

277
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,833
A Zoanoid?!

278
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:21,916
[MAKISHIMA]
Looks like Chronos has been

279
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,208
keeping an eye on
us all this time.

280
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:28,916
That's just what I needed.
You're a real life-saver, pal.

281
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,791
One more thing, give Sho
a message for me.

282
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,916
Tell him I'll be dropping by
soon to pay him a visit.

283
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,916
<i>I see, so I guess this means</i>
<i>we're enemies again, huh?</i>

284
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,875
You're back.

285
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,458
Tetsuro...

286
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,708
Well, go on, say hello!

287
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,375
Why don't you?

288
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,250
<i>Mizuki...</i>

289
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:22,958
<i>Mizuki, no matter what,</i>
<i>I want to protect this world.</i>

290
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,416
<i>I want to be wherever you are,</i>

291
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,125
<i>fighting to protect</i>
<i>our memories,</i>

292
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,875
<i>and fighting to</i>
<i>protect our future.</i>

293
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,708
Sho, welcome home!
