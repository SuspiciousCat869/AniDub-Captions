[Risker cries out in pain]

00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,458
[RISKER] What the hell
is happening to me?

6
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,708
Im..Impossible!

[NEWSCASTER]
We interrupt this program to

12
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,375
bring you a breaking newsflash.

13
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,166
Shortly after 4:00 AM
this morning,

14
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,666
the Max Pharmaceuticals
building,

15
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,375
located in Odaiba Tokyo,

16
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,833
experienced a
catastrophic explosion.

17
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,125
One of our correspondents
is live on the scene.

18
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,041
Ms. Takeyama,
give us a run down.

19
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,291
As you can see just behind me,
large plumes of black smoke

20
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,958
are billowing out of
the Max Pharmaceuticals

21
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,958
head office building
and rising to the sky,

22
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,791
blotting out the sunrise.

23
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,875
[TAKEYAMA] Right now I'm
reporting from Rainbow Bridge.

24
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,125
Unfortunately, we can't get
any closer

25
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,625
due to the danger of secondary
explosions or building collapse.

26
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,416
A Max Pharmaceuticals public
relations representative

27
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,458
claims that the cause
of the explosion is

28
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,625
still under investigation, but
police are already considering

29
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,291
the possibility of this
being a terrorist act.

30
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,500
[NEWSCASTER] And how about the
surrounding neighborhoods?

31
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,333
Do you have any reports yet?

32
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,833
Yes, since the explosion
occurred early this morning,

33
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,916
there are, fortunately,
no reports of any harm

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,291
to motorists,
pedestrians or residents.

35
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,500
However, it is still unknown
whether there were any

36
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,041
late-night workers or
security officers in--

37
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,583
Thank God he's back safe.

38
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,041
Are you all right?

39
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,583
[SHO] <i>I still have the burn</i>
<i>scar I got when I was a kid.</i>

40
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,000
<i>Everything feels the same,</i>

41
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,541
<i>but I can't stop thinking</i>
<i>about what Tetsuro said.</i>

42
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,833
[SHO] A clone?

43
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,958
Yeah, sure! I bet
some of your cells

44
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,541
were left over on
the control metal

45
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:25,208
and the Guyver used its power
to reconstruct you from that.

46
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,208
I mean, the Guyver can
regenerate pretty fast,

47
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,416
so it makes sense if it
did the same thing to you.

48
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:41,708
[SHO] <i>A clone? Is that all I am?</i>
<i>This can't really be happening.</i>

49
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,041
<i>I don't know what's</i>
<i>going on anymore.</i>

50
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:51,833
<i>What am I supposed to do now?</i>
<i>Just try and be "normal" again?</i>

51
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,666
[FUMIO] Hey, Sho, are you awake?

52
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,416
Oh, uh-huh.

53
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:17,500
There's breakfast if you'd like
some. Are you hungry?

54
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:21,791
Yeah, I'm starving. I'll be
down in just a minute.

55
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:25,791
Right, well... Don't let the
miso soup get cold, okay?

56
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,416
Jeez, Dad, I can get it.

57
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,125
So about last night...

58
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:58,458
I mean... Did you make sure to
eat dinner while you were out?

59
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:06,791
There's leftovers. I saved you
some from dinner, Son.

60
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,416
Oh, thanks. I might
have some later.

61
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,208
Is there something wrong
with the soup?

62
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:22,416
Mm-mm, it's good. I mean, it
tastes just like usual.

63
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,125
How else is it supposed to
taste? What's wrong?

64
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,166
You're acting kind of strange.

65
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:33,458
You think so? I guess I...
I am... huh?

66
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,208
You're probably just tired.
I'm the same way,

67
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,791
with all this overtime
I've been doing.

68
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,375
I got so worn out last night

69
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,500
that I fell asleep right
here on the table.

70
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:47,166
Oh, sorry... I, uh... couldn't
call last night... ya see...

71
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,166
When I was laying here last
night, I had a funny dream.

72
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,666
Huh?

73
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,500
About your mother.

74
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:06,333
She was right there in the
kitchen. Washing all the dishes.

75
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:09,458
Of course, I was sitting here
reading the newspaper.

76
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,916
And you were just a precocious
little three year old

77
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,666
careening down hallway.

78
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,791
Then, you slide into your mom
and grab onto her leg.

79
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,958
She just smiles
and says "Sweetie,

80
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,708
why don't you go and play with
your father for a little while?"

81
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,583
So you tear over to me
just as fast as you can

82
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,166
and hop into my lap.

83
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,750
Then, while I was sitting here
stroking your little head,

84
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,083
I thought...

85
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:33,291
"Wait, my son s already in
highschool, isn't he?!"

86
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,416
Then I woke up and the kitchen
was empty again.

87
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,083
I said "Just a dream, huh?"
But...

88
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,791
I felt this warmth,
like your mother's scent

89
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,541
was still lingering in the air.

90
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,208
I could almost touch it.

91
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,875
You know, it's funny, but I
remember her smell too.

92
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,250
[FUMIO] Do you?

93
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,833
Yeah... when I think back to
when I was a little kid,

94
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,083
Mom's scent and touch and

95
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,958
everything just comes
to mind naturally.

96
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:00,791
I can't believe it's been
ten years already.

97
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,916
[FUMIO] Hey, Sho...
[SHO] Hm?

98
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,625
You still remember
what happened

99
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,708
at your mother's
funeral, don't you?

100
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,291
[SHO]
Yeah.

101
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,416
[FUMIO] You were so brave. You
wouldn't let anyone see you cry.

102
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,458
Some of the family were
saying things like

103
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,791
"He still doesn't grasp the fact
that his mother is dead" or

104
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,541
"I can't believe he's so
cold-hearted."

105
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,041
But I know that's not true.

106
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:26,708
You just waited until after the
funeral and people had gone.

107
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,791
That was when you stood in
front of your mom's portrait

108
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,291
all alone and cried.

109
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,250
You saw that?

110
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,500
Yeah. You didn't want me to
know how sad you were.

111
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,916
You were afraid it would
hurt me, right?

112
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,916
Since I was so
emotionally drained

113
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,375
after losing your mother like
that, you had to be strong

114
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,875
for us both and show me that
everything was going to be okay.

115
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,500
That's what you were
thinking, right?

116
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:54,041
I... I don't know how I felt.
I... was just a little kid then.

117
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,875
When you were growing up,
everyone thought you

118
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,583
were a crybaby.
Even your homeroom teacher

119
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,625
in elementary school called me
up and said she was concerned.

120
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,666
But the truth is, ever
since you were little,

121
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,541
you've been the strongest,
bravest kid I've ever met.

122
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:11,250
Listen, I know you're all grown
up now, but I'm still your dad.

123
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,666
So if something's wrong...

124
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,000
[SHO] Dad, this is really good.

125
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,416
[SHO] Thanks for the food.

126
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,500
Well, Honey, guess
he's not going to

127
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,291
talk to me about it after
all. Oh well...

128
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,291
You're leaving early today. 

129
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,500
That's right. I wanted to get
home at a decent hour for once.

130
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,708
But if you end up making dinner,
don't go to any trouble, okay?

131
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,791
It's no trouble. I'll make
something good, all right?

132
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,333
Sounds great. See you.

133
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,750
Okay.

134
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,708
Hey Sho, are you sure you're
feeling up to this?

135
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,416
You're not gonna hurt my
feelings or anything

136
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,166
if you don't want
to hang out today.

137
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,000
No, it's all right, I don't want
Mizuki to get any more worried

138
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,625
about me than
she already is.

139
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,625
[TETSURO] Well, as long as
you re sure it s okay, I guess.

140
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,083
By the way, have you been
watching TV?

141
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,666
It's not like it's any surprise,

142
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,958
but everyone's talking
about the big explosion.

143
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,041
Oh uh... Don't worry though.

144
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,000
They didn't say anything
about us or the Guyver,

145
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,875
just Max Pharmaceuticals.

146
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,291
Mr. Tanaka...

147
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,041
It's not so bad.

148
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,458
I mean, Chronos headquarters
was wiped out and all, right?

149
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,916
[SHO] Yeah...

150
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,083
What's wrong?

151
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:17,375
Tetsuro, listen. I don't want
Mizuki involved.

152
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,541
I wouldn't worry about
it too much.

153
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,791
Our lips are sealed,

154
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,166
and nobody else knows
what's going on. Right?

155
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,541
[knocking]

156
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,083
[MIZUKI] Come in.

157
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,416
Mizuki?

158
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:40,875
How are you?

159
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,583
Hey, Makishima. So you came
to visit too, huh?

160
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:50,541
Well then, I guess I'll be
going now. Take it easy.

161
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,125
Uh, Makishima, wait.

162
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,375
I haven't had a chance to thank
you for all you ve done.

163
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,333
It was nothing, really.

164
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,083
I know you say that, but I
really appreciate it.

165
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,708
Thanks a lot. I owe you one.

166
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,083
What's wrong? You're
looking kind of glum.

167
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,583
Is something bothering
you, Fukamachi?

168
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,458
Uh, no, I'm fine, really.

172

Welcome home, Master Agito.
I hope you're well.

173
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,500
[MAKISHIMA] I'm fine.
[BUTLER] You have a guest

174
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,666
waiting for you
in the parlor, Sir.

175
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,000
A guest?

176
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,875
Sorry to keep you waiting...

[MAKISHIMA] <i>Guyot?!</i>

00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,500
We meet again, Agito. Surprised?

00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,708
[MAKISHIMA] <i>He's alive?</i>

181
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:16,375
Mizuki, what are you
so angry about?

182
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,125
I don't care much for your
attitude right now.

183
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,250
You've been acting like Sho
and I did something wrong

184
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,958
since we came to the hospital.

185
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,541
We were just worried!

186
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,583
Worried, huh!? If you two
really cared about how I felt

187
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,208
you'd stop playing games and
tell me what's going on!

188
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,500
I...

189
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,833
I know you're hiding something.

190
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,875
I'm not putting up with
this anymore.

191
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,750
I swear, I'm not speaking
to either of you

192
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,291
until you tell me! Hmph!

193
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,083
Mizuki, I'm sorry!

194
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,708
I can't say why, but
please believe me...

195
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:50,750
I promise you won t have to
go through that ever again.

196
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,708
[TETSURO] Someday,
when the time is right,

197
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,250
I'll tell you everything.

198
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:58,000
But for now, please, just
try to understand.

199
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,375
Okay, fine.

200
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,583
Now let go of my arm! You don't
have to treat me like a child!

201
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,875
Well, guess I'm going in.

202
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,583
All right then, sorry for
the trouble and...

203
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,833
Sho!

204
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,875
Thank you for coming
to see me today.

205
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,833
Well see you later! Bye!

206
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,500
Yeah, I'll catch you at
school or something.

207
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,291
Well, Mizuki...

208
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,250
Now then, there's probably
a whole mountain of laundry

209
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,208
waiting for me back
at the house, huh?

[GUYOT]
Excellent.

00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:53,083
The reinforcements from

[APTOM] Sir.
[MAKISHIMA] Excuse me, Sir,

218
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,666
but what exactly do you mean by

219
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,875
"reinforcements from
Relic's Point?"

220
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,458
The Lost Number Commandos,
of course.

221
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,041
The Lost Numbers?!

222
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:14,833
You mean you called THEM here
to retrieve the Guyver units?

223
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:18,291
That's what the circumstances
dictated. I had no choice.

224
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,875
I'm kinda starting to feel
like a housewife.

fight me with THAT, are you?

With his friends in

captured as a living sacrifice,

298
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:52,083
Sho must fight to defend
his fragile reality.
