[MIKAELA]
Hello again, Yu.

2
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,958
Are you ever going
to tell me why

3
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:41,500
you abandoned your own family?
Aw, c'mon, say it.

4
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,208
If you don't, you're gonna
keep having this dream.

5
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:47,416
It's a reflection of the
darkness inside of you.

6
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,041
I now dwell within you.
And I am...

7
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,250
[ASURAMARU]
I am your power.

8
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:58,375
Call for me when you feel
like your spirit's breaking.

9
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,375
You must surrender
yourself to me.

10
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:05,125
Then I can get you the
revenge that you so desire.

11
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,333
Oh! And there's one last thing.

12
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,166
Wake up, Yu.

Heh.

00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,916
[YUICHIRO]
Finally.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,458
It's about time I got the
chance to kill some vampires.

19
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,000
[YUICHIRO]
Mika...

[SHINOA]
My, my, take a look at you!

22
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:49,166
That uniform looks
awfully good on ya.

23
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,916
Oh, thanks. And you...

24
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,125
--[SHINOA] Hm? Hmmm?
--[YUICHIRO grunts]

00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,708
Oh, never mind.

26
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,291
You don't have to say it.
I know what you're thinking.

27
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:01,208
"You look drop-dead
gorgeous, Shinoa!"

28
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,500
So... I thought we
were meeting there.

29
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,291
Don't cha want your orders?

30
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,583
Let's hear 'em.

31
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,833
Do you remember the
vampires Guren mentioned?

32
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,458
He wants us to go to
Shinjuku to investigate.

33

[train screeches]

36
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,166
Then, let me ask you this.

37
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,625
Are we gonna kill bloodsuckers
when we get there?

38
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,666
We get it. You hate vampires.
Enough with the bloodlust.

39
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,416
Is that all you're
interested in?

40
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,125
There's more to our job
than just killing vampires.

41
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,041
Hey! Are you listening?

42
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,083
But you're so boring.

43
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,791
I guess you don't wanna survive
once we get outside the wall.

44
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:51,875
[YUICHIRO]
Hmph.

00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,791
[train screeches]

46
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,416
We're from the
Moon Demon Company.

47
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,708
We have orders beyond the wall.
Would you please let us out?

48
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:28,916
What? There's no way.

49
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,708
That's an elite squad, right?

50
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,666
Yeah, it's no place
for little kids.

51
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,041
[GUARD 7B]
Shut up! They can hear you.

52
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,916
Hey, he just called you
a kid. How'd ya like that?

53
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,416
They're talking about you
'cause you're so short.

54
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Whatever, I won't
be short forever,

55
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,208
I'm still blossoming.

56
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:46,291
My sister Mahiru was taller,
and she had the kind of rack

57
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,541
that made all the
boys lust after her.

58
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,166
Huh. I didn't know
you have a sister.

59
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,291
No, I had a sister.

60
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,458
Shinoa, I'm sorry.

61
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,708
What?

62
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,500
You don't have a silly
comeback for that one?

'Kay. Let's get going, Yu.

[SHINOA] In a completely
devastated world like this...

65
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,041
It seems everybody's
lost someone

66
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,958
who's important to them.
It's just a way of life.

What in the hell is going on?

69
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,208
You wanna explain why
I've been placed

70
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,833
in a squad full of new recruits?

71
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,291
That girl. Who is she?

72
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,333
Don't know.

73
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,208
Maybe she's a
new member like you!

00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's find out!

look at your ugly mug.

What's goin' on over there?

81
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,375
I could understand if you
had made me team leader

82
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,041
in charge of the newbs,
but you chose her!

83
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,083
You've gotta be kidding me!

84
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,916
Do you seriously
think Shinoa Hiragi

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,583
is more qualified than I am?

86
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,625
Well, well. Look who's here.

87
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,875
You! How dare you, Shinoa!
You're no team leader!

Sorry, Mitsu,

89
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,333
but Guren thinks I'm
right for the job.

[GUREN] Don't even think
about it, Mitsuba!

From this day forward, Shinoa
is your team leader, so I--

93
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:20,041
Don't worry, Lieutenant Colonel,
I can handle Mitsu's temper.

94
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,916
After all, I'm a mature woman.

95
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,625
The whining of an incompetent
loser doesn't affect me one bit.

like solitary confinement.

'Cause that's where you're
headed if you keep this up.

106

[GUREN] I'm gonna take
a different route to Shinjuku,

107
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,291
but I'll meet you there.

108
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,500
Before I go, let me
make one thing clear.

109
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,208
The Moon Demon
Company's squads move

110
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:14,291
in a five-man formation.
That's why Mitsuba's here.

111
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,041
We've found that five
is the golden number

112
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,625
when facing armed vampires.

113
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,250
Any more than that, and
attacks can get confusing.

114
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,000
Any less and we
start losing troops.

115
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:26,750
So I want the five of you
to stick together.

116
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,250
I don't want any
more in-fighting

117
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:32,000
or one of you idiots trying
to fly solo. Is that clear?

118
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:36,458
As crystal, sir! Hear that,
Mr. Reckless Behavior?

119
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,083
Hmph. I can't promise anything.

120
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,875
If I come face-to-face
with a vamp,

121
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,458
I may just have to--

122
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,333
What's your problem?

123
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,458
Oh, wow. Quick reflexes kid.

124
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,500
Now I get it,
Lieutenant Colonel Guren.

125
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,375
[MITSUBA]
You put me on this squad

126
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:00,083
so I could train the new
recruits. Consider it done, sir!

127
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,708
What're they gonna learn
from a troublemaker?

128
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,500
[MITSUBA] Since when have I
ever caused you any trouble?

129
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:06,708
Aw, man.

130
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,916
That girl is a pain
in the ass. For real.

131
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,166
Oh, wow.

132
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,916
If you're calling someone
a pain in the ass,

133
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,250
they must be pretty bad.

134
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,916
You say somethin'?

135
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,333
[laughs] Nope, not me! Nuh-uh.

136
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,833
Did her kick hurt?

137
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,791
Kinda. I'm okay.

138
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,291
[GUREN]
Listen up!

139
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,166
Your fellow squad members are
now your comrades, got it?

140
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,291
That means they're more
important than family.

141
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,333
Protect them with your life.

142
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,208
[yawns]

143
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,083
Tch.

144
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,208
Okay.

145
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,166
Are you ready for
your first mission?

146
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,041
[GUREN] I want the five
of you to head to Harajuku.

147
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,291
According to our intel,

148
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,458
there's a growing
vampire settlement there.

149
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,416
Crush them and free the
people they're holding hostage.

150
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,416
Then head north to Shinjuku.

151
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,500
This place is a wreck.

152
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,958
I barely remember what it
used to look like anymore.

153
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,208
I haven't been outside the wall

154
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,333
since I've been in the
Demon Army's custody.

155
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,750
Before you and Kimizuki joined

156
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,500
our general ed class,
you used to patrol

157
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,208
the outside as guards,
didn't you?

158
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,500
That's right. It sucked.

159
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,750
[MITSUBA]

00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:53,875
I don't give a crap
about formation.

320
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,791
Our comrade's about to die!

321
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,333
[yells]

322
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,416
I did it!

323
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,625
[gasps]

324
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:09,750
[gasps]

325
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:17,125
You idiot. [coughs]

326
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,375
What did I do?

327
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,416
[TROOPER 7A]
Hurry. Get outta here!

328
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,583
[gasping, whimpering]

329
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,666
[SHINOA]
It wasn't your fault.

330
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,500
You did everything you
could in your situation.

331
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,625
What happened that day had
nothing to do with you

332
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,958
--breaking formation, Mitsu.
--[thud]

333
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,375
[MITSUBA]
Shinoa.

334
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,916
[SHINOA]
Yeah?

335
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:51,750
Don't ever come in while
I'm showering again.

336
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,833
[giggles] Aw, c'mon,
don't be so shy!

337
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,208
Wha...? No!

338
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,791
--[SHINOA giggling]
--[MITSUBA yelling]

339
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,541
I can't tell if they're
giggling or fighting.

340
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,125
[laughs]

341
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,833
[gasps]

342
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,541
If you don't mind,
there's something important

343
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,500
that I'd like to ask
you about. Cool?

344
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,375
We wanna save other people.

345
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:20,250
Do the vampires have a lair?
And if so, where can we find it?

346
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,375
[YUICHIRO]
It's okay.

347
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,333
You don't have to tell us
anything if you don't want to.

348
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,416
We understand.

349
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,291
[SHINOA]
Goodness! I feel so refreshed!

350
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,041
Yeah, I bet you do, perv!

351
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,458
[SHINOA, MITSUBA]
Huh?

352
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,833
--[gasps]
--[YOICHI] Um...

353
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,500
I don't mind telling.

354
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,625
I wanna show my appreciation.

355
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:43,416
[YUICHIRO] Don't worry
about that. It's not a big deal.

356
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,750
You must be scared, and I
don't blame you one bit.

357
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:49,291
You don't have to tell us
just 'cause we saved you.

358
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,291
--[MITSUBA] Dumbass.
--[YUICHIRO] Wha...?

359
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,166
It's Omotesando.

360
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,166
[grunts]

361
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,041
That's where you'll
find the vampire's lair.

362
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,291
According to the girl,

363
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,583
the vampires have a lair in
the Omotesando subway station.

364
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:11,666
She said they're actually
raising human children there.

365
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,666
[KIMIZUKI]
Question.

366
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,416
[SHINOA]
Yes? What is it, Kimizuki?

367
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,375
[KIMIZUKI] What are we going
to do about the civilians

368
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,166
they've captured?

369
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,333
We'll ignore them for now.

370
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,750
They're not our priority
on this mission.

371
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,166
We've got bigger things
to worry about.

372
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,541
What's that look for?

373
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,791
If you've got a problem,
you can go back to Shibuya.

374
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,666
[YUICHIRO]
Nope, no problems here.

375
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,208
As long as I get to kill
bloodsuckers, I'm good.

376
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,000
[SHINOA]
Okay, everyone, stay alert!

377
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,708
Also, if the vampires are awake
and armed when we go in,

378
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:37,833
we'll have to retreat.

379
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,666
[gasps] We're gonna
retreat again?!

380
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,833
This is it.

381
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,708
To be honest, you guys
might be able to fend off

382
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,083
the vampires on your own

383
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,208
since you have the
Black Demon Series.

384
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,666
But that's dangerous,
so I think it'd be best

385
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,875
for us to stick together.

386
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,083
Be careful.

387
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,416
And whatever you do,
don't break formati--

388
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,625
Yeah, yeah, I won't.

389
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,166
At least you recognize
I could do it alone.

390
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,833
That's enough for me.

391
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:21,666
[SHINOA]
All right, team. Let's move out.

392
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,416
[YUICHIRO]
Next time, on Seraph of the End.

393
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
"First Extermination."
