already infiltrated

the Southwest region.
If they manage

00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:31,375
to break through here,
too, Shinjuku is lost.

But we're not gonna
let them do that!

You shouldn't act
so cocky, Lacus.

You were ten feet to
the right of the target.

in the western defensive barrier
just before you showed up.

We've got a

holding them off
right now, but who knows

how long they'll last.

is much worse than I expected.

[CORPORAL NAGAI] Yes. It's been
a nightmare from the start.

Could your group head west
and reinforce our defenses?

would be a big help.

pullin' any punches.

of them is the commander?

It's not like I'm just

I'm keeping tabs on

and enemy troop movements
in case the bastards

decide to target
this outpost as well.

Are you saying I'm late?

You're the one who called me
here on such short notice.

106
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,375
So, what's with the big hurry?

Guren, sir.

108
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,708
We've returned from our mission.

are going to hell fast.

What do you propose
we do about it?

111
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,458
There's no way the
Extermination Squad

112
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,208
can defeat so many
of them. Can they?

00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,250
Great. The whole
squad's finally here.

Shigure. How's Yu's team doin'?

115
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,583
They managed to free
all of the civilians.

116
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,333
They've moved on to Shinjuku.

117

Really? Well done.

118
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:31,000
They'll be a good addition
to the reinforcement team.

119
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,583
The battlefield is the
best place to grow stronger,

120
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,958
as long as you
don't end up dead.

121
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:41,416
Okay, it's time
we join this fight.

122
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,083
Pretty sure I know where to
find the vampire commander.

123
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,041
This might be over fast
if we take the leader's head.

124
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:54,208
What's this? Someone's
got their eyes on us.

Nevermind. Nothing for
you to worry about.

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,125
So, how are you feeling?

128
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,333
It's been a while
since you were last here.

129
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,166
You probably have some
bad memories of this place.

130
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,041
But even I must admit
that the humans

131
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,500
built themselves a
pretty impressive city.

132
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,291
Plus, you may even
get a chance to see

133
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:17,125
your beloved Yu while
you're here. What a bonus.

Go ahead.

137
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,750
[MIKAELA grunts]

138
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,083
[FERID]
You should take advantage

139
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,166
of being on the battlefield,
since it's forbidden

140
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,000
to drink directly
from a human back home.

141
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,583
Ha! And why should
I follow those rules?

142
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,708
They didn't stop you
from drinking my blood.

143
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,208
You didn't hesitate.

144
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,875
Ha! Don't say such things
or you'll hurt my reputation.

145
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,041
Besides, it was you who came

146
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,541
and offered me your
blood that night.

147
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:48,958
Though,

148
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,708
it was so you could steal a gun
and map from my mansion.

149
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,416
How did that work out for you?

150
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,083
I had no idea that I was
playing into your hands,

151
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,000
or that my family would
be killed to amuse you.

152
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,333
[FERID]
Hm.

153
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,666
[MIKAELA] How many humans
have been slaughtered

154
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,500
just because you
got a little bored?

155
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,750
[FERID]
Oh, Mika...

156
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,375
Why are you still upset
about ancient history?

157
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:13,083
What's it matter? You're a
vampire yourself now.

158
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,333
[MIKAELA] I'm not upset.
At least, not at you.

159
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,708
I'm angry with myself because
I didn't have the power

160
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,458
to protect my family.

161
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,875
[FERID] Hm. You're a glutton
for self-punishment.

162
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,375
So, how are you
going to protect Yu?

163
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,458
He's the last of your family
in this whole wide world.

164
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,333
That's love!

165
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,166
It could be eternal!

166
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,625
[FERID laughs]
But seriously, Mika.

167
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,708
You really need to drink
a human's blood soon.

168
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:48,166
You know what happens to
vampires who get too thirsty.

169
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,750
I'd hate for that
to happen to you.

170
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,125
Tch.

171
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,708
[panting, whimpering]

172
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:37,125
[KRUL] Come on, Mika.
Just drink his blood.

173
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,958
Accept that this
is your life now

174
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,500
and I promise you,
you'll start feeling better.

175
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,375
You'll finally be transformed
into a complete vampire

176
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,875
with an immortal body
and strength far beyond

177
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,458
that of a human.

178
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:55,291
[MIKAELA grunting] No. No way!
I refuse to become a vampire.

179
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,041
[giggles] You say
that now, but your body

180
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,166
must be craving blood.

181
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,375
[KRUL] I bet every muscle
you have is in pain.

182
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,000
Thirsty, and crying
out for a sip.

183
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,125
[KRUL]
Why do you fight it?

184
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,500
Give your body what it desires.

185
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,750
Shut up!

186
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,875
You're going to waste away.

187
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:24,375
I'd rather die as a human,
than live as a vampire!

188
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,416
I see.

189
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,833
I'll admit, immortality isn't as
glamorous as one might think.

190
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,875
It can be boring, living for
thousands of years, never aging.

191
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,416
Maybe you've got the right idea.

192
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,166
There's just one problem:
you can't die normally anymore.

193
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,375
[whimpers]

194
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,875
[KRUL] Because I've
changed you for good.

195
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,708
If you don't drink blood,
you'll become a hideous demon.

196
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,791
You'll have no will
or mind of your own.

197
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,166
So you have to drink,
Mika, or else you'll--

198
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,250
[MIKAELA]
There's no way I'll do it!

199
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:55,166
Never. I will never become
a monster like you!

200
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,500
Well. I'll give you
another option, then.

201
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,458
[gasps]

202
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,458
Drink your fill of my blood.

203
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:14,583
It's the only other way
that you'll survive.

204
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:21,333
[MIKAELA gasping, panting]

205
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:27,708
[KRUL] There's absolutely no
reason for you to refuse this.

206
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,166
Here. Have a little taste.

207
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:33,750
[MIKAELA grunts]

208
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,333
[MIKAELA]
No. Weren't you listening to me?

209
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,708
I won't ever become one of you!

[laughs] That's it. Drink deep.

215
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,458
You're mine now, Mika.

216
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,000
You're never going to
be able to leave me.

217
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,500
[KRUL]
For all eternity.

218
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:16,666
You're my pet.

219
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,250
My obedient little
blond servant.

220
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,541
Mikaela Hyakuya.

221
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,625
[MIKAELA] I've got ten days'
worth of Krul's blood.

222
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,500
[MIKAELA] I have to find
Yu before I run out.

223
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,583
Before I'm too thirsty.

224
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,541
We should be at
the defensive line

225
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:18,750
in the next 15 minutes.
Things might get a little bumpy.

226
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,166
There's something we
need to go over

227
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,750
before we get to the
front line. Listen up.

228
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,166
Huh? What is it?

229
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,083
This might sound weird.
But I've got something for you.

230
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,041
It's time for you boys
to take your medicine.

231
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,916
Wait. What medicine?

232
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,041
Are you in charge of
handing out vitamins now?

233
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,041
[SHINOA] Remember how
strong that noble was?

234
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,750
Surely you've realized that he
was way out of our league.

235
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,500
Even with the Black
Demon Series weapons,

236
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,416
he could've slaughtered us
in the blink of an eye.

237
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,666
There'd be nothing left of you!

238
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,250
You will be of
no use to the army

239
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,333
if you're a bunch of corpses.

240
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,833
[SHINOA] Honestly, you'd be
as useless as little babies

241
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,458
with toys if we were
really fighting a noble.

242
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,750
[YUICHIRO]
Why is she smiling?

243
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,708
You're not very reassuring.

244
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,708
So, what do you want us to do?

245
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,541
Well. This is gonna
seem strange,

246
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,791
but I'm sure you'll get
the hang of it quickly.

247
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:09,875
Then it'll be second
nature. Here we are!

248
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,291
A pill?

249
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,958
[MITSUBA] It's how everybody
gets a little boost

250
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,250
before battle.

251
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,416
Yup.

252
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,958
I hate to say it,
but we're all doping.

253
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,291
It will help in synchronizing
with your demon.

254
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,833
And that means,
your power increases.

255
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,875
So if I take one of those,
I'll be able to kill nobles?

256
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,375
[SHINOA] It's not guaranteed,
but you'd have

257
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,000
a much better chance
of not dying.

258
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,208
One pill and you're
one-and-a-half times stronger.

259
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,041
If you take two,
you're 1.8 times stronger.

260
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,458
That's crazy!

261
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,041
Then if I take,
like, ten of them...

262
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,416
[SHINOA] You'd probably
become some sort of god!

One thing, though.

266
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,250
Your organs explode
when you take three.

[gasps]

268
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,958
Even two pills will
severely damage your body

269
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,791
and could cause you
to die of shock.

270
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,250
To be safe, you should
stick to one at first.

271
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,083
Also, the effects only
last for 15 minutes.

272
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,333
After the pill wears off,

273
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:03,250
you'll be just as
vulnerable as you are now.

274
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,166
[SHINOA]
Here. A pack for each of you.

275

Why didn't you give
these to us earlier?

276
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,958
We could have used 'em
against that noble.

277
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,583
We could've destroyed that guy!

278
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,041

We still wouldn't have won.

[gasps]

280
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,791
It takes ten seconds
before the pill's effects

281
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,791
start to take hold. In those
ten seconds we'd be dead.

He could've killed
every single one of us.

One more question.

284
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,791
You mentioned demons earlier.

I definitely wanna max out
my Black Demon Series.

will I be able to draw out

Nope! This is war!

So for now, you'll
take a shortcut.

Hey. Come on. Wake up!

316
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,166
[grunts]

317
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,625
[SHINOA gasps]

318
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,375
[SHINOA]
We fell through to the subway.

319
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,083
[YUICHIRO]
Yeah.

320
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,291
[SHINOA]
Where are the others?

321
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,291
[YUICHIRO] I don't think
they fell with us.

322
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,166
But the corporal here is
banged up pretty badly.

323
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,000
[SHINOA] We need to get him
to the temporary shelter

324
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,458
above ground.

325
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,958
There should be medics there
who can treat his wounds.

326
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:12,958
[KIMIZUKI]
Hey! Idiot! You down there?

327
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,916
I can hear ya. You okay?

328
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,083
[MITSUBA]
Yeah, of course we are!

329
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:21,333
There's no way we'd die in
a place like this. Dumbass.

330
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,791
Hey, can you guys get out?

331
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,208
Yeah, No problem!

332
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,958
Then you guys go ahead
and we'll catch up with you.

333
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,166
We've gotta find a med
team for the corporal.

334
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,875
We'll meet you at
the defensive line!

335
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,041
Wait! Shouldn't we...

336
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,333
'Kay, See you at the line.

337
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,208
[rumbling]

338
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:08,416
[YUICHIRO]
Next time, on Seraph of the End.

339
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,250
"Results of the Choice."
