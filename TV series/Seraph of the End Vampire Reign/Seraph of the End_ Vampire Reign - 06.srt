Because despite how
noble you try to be,

deep down, you're
a selfish human

It's the only way you'll get

Stop it.

You're gonna submit
yourself to revenge now.

to confuse me, you bastard!

your strength to get revenge.

160
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,166
I'll take over
your body and soul.

161
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,083
All right. I guess that's fair.

162
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,875
[ASURAMARU]
My name is Asuramaru.

163
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,583
If you need power, all you
have to do is call for me.

164
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,083
[YUICHIRO]
Asuramaru.

165
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,041
[ASURAMARU] Oh, and since
you're going to be my master,

166
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,000
let me give you some
insider information as a gift.

167
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,750
[YUICHIRO]
Information?

168
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,583
[ASURAMARU] There's something
odd about your composition.

169
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,041
You appear to be human,

170
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,125
but about ten percent of you
is something... different.

171
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,291
Could the humans be doing

172
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,416
strange experiments
on you or something?

173
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,958
Huh? What are
you talking about?

174
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,208
[ASURAMARU] You shouldn't
trust your own kind.

175
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,625
Believe me when I tell you
mankind is more devious

176
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,291
than vampires and
demons combined.

177
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:04,166
Though, it does feel a little
weird saying that to a human.

178
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,583
Wait. Explain yourself.
What are you suggesting?

179
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:12,958
[gasps]

180
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,541
[ASURAMARU] Very well.
The contract is now complete.

181
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,750
From this day forward,

182
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,750
I shall lend you my
strength and abilities.

183
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,000
Open your eyes.

184
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,125
Fan the flames of desire
that burn inside of you

185
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,250
and forge a bloodstained
path in this world.

186
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,166
Yuichiro Hyakuya!

187
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,250
[YUICHIRO gasps]

188
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,000
[GUREN] You're awake.
How ya feeling, Yu?

189
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,166
I'm okay. Uh?

190
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,416
Heh. I beat the demon.

191
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,041
[KIMIZUKI]
I wouldn't get too cocky.

192
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,041
You took your sweet time
subjugating the damned thing.

193
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,500
[YUICHIRO]
You got a Cursed Gear, too?

194
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,666
[KIMIZUKI]
Of course I did.

195
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,291
[YUICHIRO]
Hmph.

196
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,708
And Yoichi?

197
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,250
[YUICHIRO gasps]

198
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,916
So, then, who are you?

199
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,041
[TOMOE]
Hm?

200
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,375
You're the one who
called me, Yoichi.

201
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,125
If you want to avenge
your sister's death,

202
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,541
you need a strong set
of Cursed Gear to wield.

203
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,333
Oh, that's right.

204
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,833
I picked up a weapon and was
going to make a contract with--

205
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:45,541
I see. That's what
you are, a demon.

206
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:46,875
That's right.

207
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,416
Hmph. It's pretty mean you
chose to look like this.

208
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,583
[TOMOE] Just wait until
you see my true form.

209
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,458
[chuckles]

210
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,541
Yeah, I bet it's pretty nasty.

211
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,041
So, it seems we have
a bit of a problem.

212
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,083
Huh?

213
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,708
I've poured over
your heart and soul.

214
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,500
You wanna strike back
at those who hurt you,

215
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,666
but that desire is too weak.

216
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:11,416
Your soul is gentle, and kind.
You have great love for others.

217
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
These are all qualities
that I despise.

218
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,666
Wait. Maybe you
should look deeper.

219
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,958
'Cause I do want
to avenge my sister.

220
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,458
You lie. In fact, the
strongest feeling you have

221
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,583
is the relief that you
survived the attack.

222
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,666
No. That's not true.

223
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,375
Not to mention you'd
make a terrible fighter.

224
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,791
You're afraid of conflict,

225
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,500
and the thought of your friends
and family getting hurt.

226
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,875
You're weak. You don't have
the courage to take a life.

227
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,250
How are you supposed
to get revenge

228
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,291
if you aren't
capable of killing?

229
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,750
What I really mean
is you're a coward.

230
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:47,291
Just a child without
a backbone. A weakling.

231

[whimpering]

233
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,416
But there is one way
you can bring hell

234
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,833
upon those who
murdered your sister.

235
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,625
Give me your body. Forever!

[YOICHI whimpering]

You don't even have the
guts to fight for your life.

241
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,666
You wouldn't make
a suitable master.

242
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,500
You're the most pathetic
human being I've ever met.

Aw, man. This is not good.

247
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,500
[GUREN] Looks like Yoichi
didn't have the strength

248
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,291
to overcome possession.

249
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,875
But, I guess having two
outta three students

250
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,791
pass the Black Demon tryout
isn't that bad at all.

[YUICHIRO]
Huh?

252
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,291
Hey, wait, where'd he go?

253
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:55,541
[YOICHI] One, two, three,
four little humans all for me.

254
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,083
Dammit, but they've each
got Cursed Gears, too.

255
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,041
Power hungry humans are
such a pain in the ass.

[YOICHI]
My bow.

257
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:08,125
All right. Now that you two
have both got your Cursed Gear,

258
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,750
it's time for
your first mission.

259
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:13,208
There's a human-eating demon
loose somewhere in this room.

260
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,083
Yu, Kimizuki.

It's up to you guys
to deal with it.

Show that bastard
who's in control.

Look at him! Your classmate's
body is just a vessel now.

The only way to save

the best of you. Snap out of it!

These boys are going to
get themselves killed!

They're not ready for this.

Please, don't make them kill
Yoichi. He's their friend!

[GUREN]
Aww.

00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,500
You always act like
you're so cool,

339
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,708
but you've got a soft spot
for these two problem students.

340
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,125
You've gotten attached,
haven't you?

341
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,708
[SHINOA]
Lieutenant Colonel!

342
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,458
Why don't you step in
and kill him, then?

343
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,458
That'll save the others

Oh, I see.

346
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,958
You've got no intention

347
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,250
of getting your
hands dirty, either.

348
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,250
Let me guess, your just
"too cute" for this as well.

349
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,000
Yoichi, get yourself together.

You're strong enough
to beat this thing!

It's too late.

[YUICHIRO]
Do it.

355
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:53,083
I won't kill a comrade,
but I won't abandon one, either.

[YUICHIRO] If Yoichi's
still alive in there,

able to shoot me.

You and I are alike
in that way.

00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,041
When you've watched your
family die in front of you...

362
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,833
...there's no way that you
could ever kill a friend.

You'll have to come
back or shoot me!

Snap out of it, Yoichi!

[YOICHI]
Fool.

Die.

Yoichi!

Are you gonna
stay under that bed

372
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,500
and watch your sister be killed
or take charge and stop it?

[YOICHI]
Uh-- Uh...

This is your last chance
to take control.

Yoichi, listen!

00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,541
No matter what happens,
don't come out from under here.

378
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm sorry. But I can't stay.

379
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:01,583
No more hiding. I'm not gonna
run away from my fears anymore!

380
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,875
That's why I need the ability
to protect those I care about.

381
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,750
I want to be able to
keep them safe from harm.

382
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:08,958
Only then can I make sure

383
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,291
nothing like this
ever happens again.

that it would end this way,

What's that? Hell no.

if one of these kids
ends up biting it.

You say that, but you
looked like you were

You have a rare gift.

The guilt you felt for
not helping your sister

has kept you from
living your life.

But I think today
you overcame that.

reach your full potential.

You have a new reason to live.

From now on, your job
is to protect the people

who saved your life today.

you out on the front lines

That's right.

We've got intel that suggests
vampires from the Kansai Region

get to hunt vampires!
