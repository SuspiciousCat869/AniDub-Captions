[YAMANAKA]
Hey, quit spacing out on us.

3
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:14,916
Can we go now? This place
gives me the creeps.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,666
Come on, Yuji.

[STUDENT]
Thanks for coming.

9
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,833
You may not remember me,

10
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,791
but I'm the one
you saved yesterday.

11
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,041
I really can't thank
you enough for that.

12
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,166
[YUICHIRO]
Sure.

13
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,166
I know this is out of the blue,
but would you take this letter?

14
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,166
It would mean so much to me.

[YUICHIRO gasps]

00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,708

--[footsteps]
--Uh.

18
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,500
[SHINOA]
My, my.

19
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,500
I guess it's only natural
for the school hero

20
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,333
to become popular
with the girls.

21
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,833
Don't let it go to your head.

22
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,416
In no time, we'll have a trail
of broken hearts to mend.

23
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,166
[YUICHIRO]
Quit talking like you know me.

24
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,875
I'm not a heartbreaker, okay?

25
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,833
[SHINOA]
Ah. I see, so you're a virgin.

26
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,041
[YUICHIRO gasps]

27
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,625
Hey! Keep it down!

28
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,666
[SHINOA] These days, virginity
might as well be considered

29
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,000
a mortal sin.

30
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,458
That's why the
Demon Army encourages

31
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,583
everyone to form
new relationships.

32
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,625
It's important that
people "hook-up."

33
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,916
[YUICHIRO]
Huh?

34
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,291
The world has already
come to an end once.

35
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,458
Anyone who wasn't
killed by the virus...

36
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,291
...ended up in the belly
of wandering monsters.

37
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,125
We're lucky that even
a tenth of us survived.

38
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,291
[SHINOA] Past those walls are
endless ruins and wastelands,

39
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,833
crawling with all
manner of beasts.

40
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,625
This world of ours: it's no
longer safe for humanity.

41
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,791
[SHINOA] That's where the
Imperial Demon Army comes in.

42
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,125
We'll gather the
remnants of mankind,

43
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:45,333
and breed our way to the top
of the food chain once again.

44
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,791
Come one and come all!

45
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:53,625
Get together! Make love!
Yay! Illicit sexual relations!

46
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah, anyway. Can I
ask you something?

47
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,416
[SHINOA]
Mm?

48
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,750
Well, is there a reason
I'm still stuck in this dump?

49
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,583
I already passed Guren's test,

50
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:06,333
and I've been assigned to the
Vampire Extermination Unit.

51
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:09,333
So, why am I wasting
time playing schoolboy?

52
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,791
Sorry.

53
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,541
That's a question for the
Lieutenant Colonel, not me.

54
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:14,791
Then how do I ask him?

55
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,000
That lazy jerk doesn't
even go to his office!

56
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,125
What am I supposed
to do, stalk the guy?

57
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,708
[SHINOA] I don't know why
you're yelling at me.

58
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,166
Do I look like his keeper?

59
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,916
[sighs]

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,791
[SHINOA]
Besides,

61
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,041
you don't need to wait
to start your new training.

62
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,916
As a matter of fact,
it's already begun.

63
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,208
Huh?

64
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,125
Our special methods
make the most difficult

65
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,833
of wishes obtainable. Soon,
you will fulfill you desires.

66
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:38,875
Oh, yeah?

67
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,416
And just what do you
know about my desires?

68
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,833
[SHINOA] I know you
want power. Like this.

69
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,250

[YUICHIRO]
Whoa. What the hell?

72
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:59,250
[SHINOA] This is the demon
I've formed a contract with.

73
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,833
Shikama Doji.

74
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,333
Try not to embarrass
yourself around him.

75
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,291
Cursed Gear? A weapon
that can kill vampires.

76
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,875
Why do you have one?

77
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,708
Why wouldn't I
have one? I'm a member

78
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,000
of the Extermination Unit,
too, after all.

79
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,666
[YUICHIRO]
It's incredible.

80
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,041
If it was mine, I could
kill any fang I wanted.

81
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,958
Not on your own, you couldn't.

82
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,250
If you want to beat vampires,

83
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,666
you've gotta learn
to work as a team--

84
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,625
[YUICHIRO]
Shinoa!

85
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:34,666
[SHINOA]
Uh.

86
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,250
I'm taking your Cursed Gear!

87
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,791
[SHINOA gasps]

88
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:45,875
Just hand it over. I need it
to get revenge for my family.

89
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,083
[SHINOA laughs]

90
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,125
[SHINOA] You can't use
someone else's Gear.

91
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,208
That's why there's a contract.

92
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,875
Then let's see how
well you handle it!

93
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,000
Bring it on, Shinoa!

94
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,125
Fine.

[grunts]

98
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,000
[SHINOA]
But fighting Cursed Gear

99
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:14,750
with conventional weaponry
won't get you far. See?

[YUICHIRO]
I don't get it.

108
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,500
You have a kick-ass weapon.

109
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,000
How could a vampire stand
a chance against you?

110
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,375
It's war! When we fight
on the battlefield,

111
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,416
we'll be up against
their soldiers.

112
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,500
There won't be any unarmed
vampires in hospital gowns.

113
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,708
They'll have weapons, too.

114
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,041
[YUICHIRO]
For real? Ugh, that sucks!

115
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,583
They suck. Why do you think
Lieutenant Colonel Guren

116
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,625
has been beating teamwork into
that thick skull of yours?

117
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,875
We cannot win this
without each other.

You gotta be kiddin' me.

We don't want trouble!
Please, hear us out!

Sorry about before.
We were grade-A jerks!

126
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,250
Will you forgive us and
make us your disciples?

127
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,375
Disciples?

128
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,375
[YOICHI]
Now, wait a second.

129
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,958
I can't have any
disciples! No way!

130
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,708
Besides, I don't deserve
that kind of honor!

Hey, it's you!

My name's Satoshi Yamanaka.

You saved me from
that vampire bitch.

136

Way to stick it
to her, Boss Man!

137

"Boss Man"?

[sighs]

139
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,916
Looks like you're
becoming popular

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,625
with the male students, too.
I'm starting to feel left out.

141
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,541
So what's with the 180?

142
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,833
You were using Yoichi
as a footrest before.

143
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,916
You've got no right to come back
and start asking him for favors.

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,708
Yeah. I can't argue
with you there.

145
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:06,125
We messed up, okay? But we could
really use his help right now!

[YUICHIRO laughs]

147

Delinquents these days
seem a little short

in the pride department.

149
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,375
Quit acting like punks

150
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,958
and people might actually
wanna help, ever think of that?

151
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,833
Hello, Pot. Meet my
dear friend, Kettle.

152
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,833
We know we got no
right to ask for help.

153
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,291
Especially after we were
such jerks to you guys.

154
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,625
But, still...

155
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,291
[YUICHIRO]
Still what?

156
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,625
It's Yuji.

157
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:33,958
The guy who was with us.

158
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,541
He went inside
the Forbidden Chamber

159
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,125
and he never came back out.

160

The Forbidden Chamber?

161
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,583
That's right.

162
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,000
And, since I heard Yoichi is
joining the Extermination Unit,

163
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,208
I thought...

164
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,291
--[SHINOA] Of course you did.
--[ALL gasp]

165
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,833
I should have guessed.

166
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,041
The words "Class One
Restricted Area" might as well

167
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,625
be a welcome mat to you morons.

168
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,291
No! It's just we... Uh...

169
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,333
[SHINOA]
There's no excuse.

170
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,708
To be honest, I don't
care why you did it.

171
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,625
I care about the punishment.

172
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,541
And as far as the
army's concerned,

173
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,333
your friend's punishment
has already been decided.

174
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:11,541
What? No way! Are we
talkin' hard time?

175
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,791
I'm sure he's
already in custody.

176
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:17,083
Oh, no! How long
will he be in there?

177
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,791
Until the army decides
to execute him.

178
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:20,833
[gasps]

179
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,791
[SHINOA]
I suggest you forget about him.

180
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,250
[footsteps tapping]

181
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,916
[YUICHIRO] So, what's with the
Forbidden Chamber, Shinoa?

182
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,375
Is it some sort of secret lab?

183
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,750
[SHINOA giggles]

184
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,333
No, nothing like that.

185
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,666
It's just one of this
school's Seven Wonders.

186
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,166
Like the piano that plays
concerts all by itself,

187
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,500
or moving anatomical dolls.

188
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,750
Though, I can't remember

189
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,291
if the Chamber is third
or fourth on the list.

190
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,208
You're not as clever
as you might think.

191
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,750
If it's a "Restricted Area,"
the military's got control.

192
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,166
So Yuji somehow
opened the chamber,

193
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,041
and now he's trapped
inside of it?

194
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,750
More than likely.
But that's not the issue.

195
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,583
The room is actually
a training facility

196
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,750
for the Extermination Unit.

197
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,458
If a non-trained civilian,
like Yuji, gets in,

198
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,958
there's a good chance they'll
be possessed by the demon.

199
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,083
Wait... Demon?

200
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,458
[SHINOA]
Remember what I told you?

201
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,958
You don't need to
worry about training

202
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,000
because it's already started.

203
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,958
It's time for us to
move on to the next step.

204
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,416
Now, if you'll follow me.

205
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,583
[YUICHIRO]
Why put a shrine in a school?

206
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,458
And, underground of all places?

207
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,916
[SHINOA]
Well, it isn't really a shrine.

208
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,791
We just like to call it that.

209
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:06,208
[wind howls]

210
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,500
[SHINOA]
Back before the virus broke out,

211
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,458
a massive underground
space was installed

212
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,875
beneath the Shibuya
part of Tokyo.

213
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,416
Its original purpose
was to prevent

214
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,041
the river from flooding
due to excess rainfall.

215
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,541
[SHINOA]
But now, it's been converted

216
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:26,041
into the Vampire Extermination
Unit's training grounds.

217
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,166
Then again,
the whole school has.

218
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,750
Basically, every student here

219
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,708
is part of a secret
military experiment.

220
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,958
The demon is the key.

221
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,958
Anyone who's unaffected
by its evil energy

222
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,250
is filtered into the Unit.

223
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,083
[YOICHI gulps]

224
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,875
Every one of us is a lab rat.
It may be hard to hear, but...

225
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,958
What'd you expect in this
messed up world we live in?

226
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,750
[SHINOA]
There are two types of people

227
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,500
who can go beyond this point:

228
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,500
those summoned by the
Extermination Unit,

229
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,500
and those chosen by the demon.

230
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,541
So... Yuji is in there?

231
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,041
[SHINOA]
If he is, we didn't summon him.

232
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,958
The demon may have
already consumed his heart.

233
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,541
And what if it
decides to grab us?

234
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,000
And eats our hearts?

235
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,583
You'd become a ravenous,

236
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,708
man-eating monster, far worse
than any vampire we've faced.

237
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:20,458
[whimpers]

238
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,916
[SHINOA]
It's not pretty.

239
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,041
That's why you need to be
thoroughly trained, first.

240
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,250
Especially your
strength of heart.

241
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,250
You need to understand the cost
of wielding this Cursed Gear.

242
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,500
That's why I
brought you to--

243
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,875
[YUICHIRO] Point is to
beat the demon, right?

244
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,958
I need power. My family has
waited for revenge long enough.

245
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,583
[YUICHIRO] If this demon
can give me what I need,

246
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,000
I don't care what I
have to do to get it.

Are you crazy?

Don't do anything, understood?

250
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,875
Just watch from a distance.

251
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,750
The Extermination Unit
will save him soon enough.

252
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,916
That's a nice weapon.

253
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,875
Has anybody else claimed it yet?

Why're you always
getting in my way?

277
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,708
[SHINOA]
Unbelievable.

278

You must be deathly
allergic to teamwork!

279
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,166
Brute force won't help
you win against a demon.

If you grab that
Gear bare handed,

possess you as well.

You'll end up just like Yuji.

to some monster.

You will this time.

285
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,708
You don't have the strength
to defeat a demon, yet.

Wha--?

287

Your heart is far
too weak to resist it.

288
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,083
Demons thrive on dark desires.

289
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,416
Your hunger for
revenge will make you

290

that much easier to control.
Do you get it now?

Guren knows you have
excellent combat skills.

00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,833
So I've been wondering, how's
the revolution coming along?

319
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,083
Huh?

320
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,000
What? Don't tell me
you forgot about it!

321
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,583
You swore you'd become
stronger than the vampires

322
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,333
then you'd free us and make
a new home for all humanity.

323
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,791
[AKO]
That's right, Yu! You did!

324
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,416
We'll be waiting for you
to keep your promise, okay?

325
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,208
And don't forget,
you need your strength

326
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,500
to save the world,
so be sure to eat up!

327
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,958
She's right, Yu! Eat your fill!

328
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,541
Don't be shy, there's more
than enough to share.

329
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,708
[YUICHIRO]
Y-Yeah, sure.

330
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,250
Quick question.

331
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,250
Are you alive or am I dreaming?

332
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,958
[MIKAELA]
We're all dead.

333
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,958
You watched Ferid
murder us, remember?

334
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,250
[CHIHIRO]
You saw it happen!

335
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,875
[TAICHI]
We're D-E-D!

336
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:54,833
[AKO]
What's wrong with him?

337
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,916
He keeps forgetting things!

338
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,916
That mean vampire noble ripped
our bodies limb from limb.

339
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,208
The only one that ran
away from him was you.

340
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,541
I didn't run away!
I tried to save you!

341
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,583
[MIKAELA]
You abandoned us.

342
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:06,875
[YUICHIRO gasps]

343
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,125
[MIKAELA]
It's been four years

344
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,416
and you still haven't
avenged our deaths.

345
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,458
It's not too late
to change that.

346
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,541
You can still get revenge
for us, and set things right.

347
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:21,000
If you'd like, I could
lend you my power.

348
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,750
Accept my gift
with all your heart

349
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,416
and vengeance will be yours.

350
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,041
Vengeance.

351
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,833
[MIKAELA]
Yes. For all of us.

352
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,125
[YUICHIRO]
You're right.

353
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,541
I need power to get back
at those parasites.

354
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:37,666
Very well.

355
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,541
Open your heart and you'll
get justice for your family.

356
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,250
[YUICHIRO]
But you're not my family.

357
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,875
[MIKAELA gasps]

--[YUICHIRO grunts]
--[MIKAELA gasps]

359
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,291
Just who are you?

360
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,291
You're not the Mika that I know!

361
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,916
[YUICHIRO]
He's not like me.

362
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,583
He'd never tell me
to live for vengeance

363
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:04,375
or try to make me feel guilty!
He'd tell me to be smart.

364
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,416
Then he'd go behind my back

365
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,583
and shoulder all
the burden himself,

366
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,166
because that's just
the kind of friend he was!

367
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,166
[YUICHIRO whimpers]

368
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,916
But I'm still here.

369
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,625
I'm done playing!
Now who the hell are you?

370
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,125
[wood cracking]

371
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,250
Stop, Yu. Listen!

372
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,500
Shut your mouth!

373
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,666
Trying to trick me with
Mika's face was a huge mistake!

374
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,833
No more games! Tell me
how you know so much

375
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,416
about my precious
family, you bastard!

376
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,791
[roars]

377
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:42,875
Ah.

378
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,416
Okay...

379
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,833
So.. why am I
lying on the floor?

380
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,041
I can't believe it.

381
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,625
You managed to come
back all on your own.

382
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,750
Come back from where, exactly?

383
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,375
[BOTH]
Uh...

384
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,958
The demon, it tricked you.

385
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:07,083
It had you trapped inside
some intense hallucinations.

386
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,166
[gasps]

387
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,583
But, even without
a contract spell,

388
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,333
you broke free with
the power of your mind.

389
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,500
That's quite an accomplishment.

390
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,916
Yeah... I have no idea
what you're saying.

391
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,375
[gasps]

392
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,083
[YUICHIRO] So, does this
axe belong to me now?

393
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,583
[SHINOA] No, it's a little
more involved than that.

394
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,375
There are procedures to follow
when you form a new contract.

395
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,666
Guren will decide which
Gear suits you best.

396
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,708
You're just gonna
have to be patient.

397
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:38,000
But I still kicked
some demon ass, right?

398
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:38,750
Uh.

399
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,125
Yeah... Technically.

400
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,833
[YUICHIRO] And this is the
second time I've beaten

401
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,916
the Moon Demon Company
to the rescue.

402
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,041
Well... yeah... I guess
you have a point.

403
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,416
[SHINOA] On top of that,
you saved another classmate.

404
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,625
[SHINOA] You won't have
to wait much longer.

405
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,458
Starting tomorrow,
you'll begin your training

406
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,833
with the rest of the
Vampire Extermination Unit.

407
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,916
[YUICHIRO]
All right!

408
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,541
[SHINOA] Not that I have the
authority to make that decision.

409
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,208
Guren won't be happy
when he finds out.

410
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,833
[YUICHIRO]
Finally...

411
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:18,958
I've made it this far.
It won't be long now.

412
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,500
[YUICHIRO]
Starting tomorrow,

413
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,708
I'm killing every last
vampire I come across.

414
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,833
[FERID]
Mika, Mika, my sweet Mika!

415
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,916
[FERID chuckles]

416
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:48,541
Hello. I had a feeling
that I would find you here.

417
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,750
Have you heard
the latest report?

418
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,583
[FERID] Apparently,
they finally tracked down

419
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:58,541
your precious angel. I told you
it was only a matter of time.

420
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:01,208
No one can stay hidden forever.

421
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,625
As we feared,

422
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:05,750
he's become a puppet
for those filthy humans.

423
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,583
What's his name?

424
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,708
[FERID]
Yuichiro, wasn't it?

425
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,208
I wonder.

426
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,625
How will you weave the next part

427
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:21,208
of this tragic tale,
my dear Mikaela?

428
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,833
[YUICHIRO]
Next time, on Seraph of the End:

429
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:09,708
"Vampire Mikaela."
