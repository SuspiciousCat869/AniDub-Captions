00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,583
I mean, why does he fight?

164
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,125
He grew up in captivity.

165
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:42,083
He and his friends made
an attempt to escape.

166
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,791
[SHINOA]
But it didn't work out.

167
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,750
Huh?

168
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:01,958
Shinoa told me about
what happened to you.

169
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,458
Is it true? Did you leave
your friends behind

170
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,250
when they were attacked?

171
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:10,541
[gasps] That's none
of your damned business.

172
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,708
Don't poke around in my past.

173
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:13,916
[MITSUBA]
Wait!

174
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,625
You were right to.

175
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,625
I know that this probably
doesn't mean anything

176
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,625
coming from me, but still.

177
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,833
I don't think you
did anything wrong.

178
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,833
I'm glad you survived.

179
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:31,416
[YUICHIRO] I left my family
behind to save my own skin.

180
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,833
Even though they were dying.

181
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:37,541
I should've stayed
with them until the end.

182
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:40,000
I can't change what happened.

183
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,541
That's why I will never...

184
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,500
Just, forget it.

185
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,666
[MITSUBA]
Yu!

186
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,041
[YUICHIRO]
What? I've said everything I...

187
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:58,708
Um, earlier...
he had me. I wanna say.

188
00:12:58,791 --> 00:12:59,833
[YUICHIRO]
Hm?

189
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,333
Uh... Ugh!

190
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,875
Wait, you wanna say what?

191
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:04,958
[MITSUBA]
Just that you almost

192
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,291
got us all killed
today, you idiot!

193
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,041
[YUICHIRO grunts]
That's what this is about?

194
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,916
[KIMIZUKI] Hey, are you two
lovebirds done flirting yet?

195
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,916
We're ready to go.

196
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,166
[MITSUBA]
What? Ugh! You shut up!

197
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,708
[YUICHIRO] Whoa! You've
gotta be kidding me.

198
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,708
You really know how
to hotwire a car?

199
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:42,958
Yup.

200
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,416
Well, this is perfect!

201
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,375
We finally found something
you're good at!

202
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,583
Would you shut up?

203
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,083
But seriously.

204
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,541
The only time I've
ridden in a car

205
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,541
was when I was a little kid.
I almost forgot about 'em.

206
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,500
There weren't any
in the vampire's city.

207
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,541
Plus, gas is so rare nowadays,
that you hardly ever

208
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,791
see them around Shibuya.

209
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,333
[engine revs]

210
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:07,125
[YUICHIRO laughs] Hell yeah!
You did it! Let's ride!

211
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,250
Hey, Kimizuki. Uh...

212
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,875
When's it gonna be my turn
to drive this thing?

213
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,041
Never.

214
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,000
You've got no experience
behind the wheel.

215
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:18,750
Well, not technically.
But I am a quick learner!

216
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,750
Just don't touch
anything for now.

217
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,000
I'll give you an intro
lesson or something later.

218
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:26,208
[gasps] You mean you can
hotwire and drive a car?

219
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,041
I guess you are cool!

220
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,250
You're like the
annoying little brother

221
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,875
I never wanted.

222
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,291
These actually aren't that bad.

223
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,416
[KIMIZUKI] I got it started.
No thanks to any of you.

224

[YOICHI]
Impressive!

225
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,625
So where'd you learn
how to do that?

226
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,708
You do know that it's
a crime to steal a car,

227
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:52,750
right Kimizuki?

228
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,833
Whatever. Let's just
get on the road.

Crap! That wasn't right.
Then it must be this way.

What do you think you're--?!

Hey, hop in!

I think I've got this
driving thing figured out.

You're so dead!

Don't you ever try that again!

[YUICHIRO]
I had a rough start!

You almost killed me!

--[YUICHIRO] Yeah, but I didn't.

ever gonna stop fighting?

00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,666
Probably not. Well,

it looks as if my
expert driving skills

are required once again.

A-ha... You think so, huh?

You know, we probably shouldn't

make fun of Shinoa's
height anymore.

[KIMIZUKI]
Maybe a Four Horsemen of John?

260
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,500
Should we go kill it?

261
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:44,458
No. If we kill one,
then more will just show up.

262
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,375
Let's head to Shinjuku and
see if we can lose them.

263
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,458
Not good.

might be waiting for us here.

Shinjuku is just ahead.

Fine.

295

[SHINOA] Yuichiro and
Kimizuki should take point

296
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,750
since they're the strongest
one-on-one fighters.

cover them and tag in

[SHINOA] Things just took
a turn for the worse.

What now? Do we retreat?

303
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,750
Getting out of here
would be the best idea.

304
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,791
But I doubt these three
will let us do that.

305
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,625
So we fight at full power.

306
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:27,291
We let the demons almost
completely possess us.

307

But that still might
not be enough.

We might not survive.

Okay, fine. If that's
how it's gonna be...

Just know that I'm not
gonna let any of you die.

00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,208
I suppose this can
wait until later.

323
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,291
I'll let all of you
go for today.

324
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,833
But next time we meet,
I'm draining every last drop

325
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,416
of your blood.

326
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,750
What?

327
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:23,208
So long for now, my cute
little blood-bag.

328
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:38,291
[pants] We're... okay.
We don't have to fight.

329
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:43,833
[YUICHIRO] That arrogant jerk.
What a bastard!

330
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,750
Treating us as if we
were his playthings.

331
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,291
Pull yourself together.

332
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,416
We need to get
out of here before

333
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,166
they start having
second thoughts.

334
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,958
Let's meet up with
the Shinjuku Units.

335
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,541
Dammit! This is all wrong!
I've got a Cursed Gear.

336
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,875
I'm supposed to be
as strong as he is.

337
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,000
Well, since you've got
the Black Demon Series,

338
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,000
you could always
learn some curses.

339
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,416
That'd help you get
closer to his power level.

340
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,541
Then why haven't you
taught me any?

341
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:10,750
Well, I could.

342
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,500
But what good is it
if you're the only one

343
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,916
who can defeat a
powerful vampire?

344
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,500
I'd probably be killed
while you fought.

345
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:22,541
Yoichi. Mitsuba. They'd just
end up dying, too.

346
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,625
That's why we have
to work together.

347
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,083
All of us have to keep training

348
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:29,250
so that we fight
as a unit of equals.

349
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,708
We're improving.

350
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,250
I was happy to hear you
ask about retreating.

351
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,750
And there's something
else I have to say.

352
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,333
Thank you for saving
my life earlier, Yu.

353
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,625
It's like Lieutenant
Colonel Guren said,

354
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,083
you care about your friends.

355
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:47,000
Huh? Oh, It was nothing.

356
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,250
[MISTUBA]
Hm.

357
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:55,833
[rumbling]

358
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,125
You know.

359
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,958
I'm kinda ready to go
back to Shibuya.

360
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:02,083
I hear ya, but right now
it's not an option.

361
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,958
If Shinjuku falls,
then Shibuya's next.

362
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,375
Your sister's there.

363
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,208
Remember that when we fight.

364
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:11,041
Let's get moving.

365
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,958
We won't lose Shinjuku.

366
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,291
[YUICHIRO]
Right.

367
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:08,083
[YUICHIRO]
Next time, on Seraph of the End.

368
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,291
"Vampire Attack."
