00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:35,916
[CHIHIRO]
It's so good!

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,708
Why aren't you
eating anything?

162
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,166
You not hungry?

163
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,166
--Nah.
--[TAICHI] Aw, yuck!

164
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,666
[TAICHI]
There are carrots in here!

165
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,375
Hey, Akane! Guess what?
Today's actually my birthday!

166
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,541
Well, whaddya know?
It's my birthday, too!

167
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,708
No fair! I want one!

168
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,041
I do, too!

169
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,416
I have no choice then.

170
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,541
I officially declare today
everyone's birthday!

171
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:59,416
--[KOUTA] For real?
--[CHIHIRO] Awesome! Yay!

172
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,541
Remember to thank Mika
whenever he gets home.

173
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,541
Will do!

174
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,416
Why isn't he here for dinner?

175
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,375
Does he not like curry?

176
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:11,416
Where is Mika?
Do you know, Yu?

177
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,333
Sorry, I don't.

178
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,500
[FUMIE gasps]
Taichi ate my curry!

179
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,708
[AKANE] Then Taichi can
give up the rest of his.

180
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:22,833
[TAICHI]
Aw, man!

181
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,625
[KIDS giggle]

182
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,500
[TAICHI]
Why do I always get in trouble?

183
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,083
[door creaks]

184
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,666
[gasps]

185
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:59,000
Aw. You stayed up? I'm touched.

186
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,750
Whatever.

187
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,208
Don't tell me you're
still angry with me.

188
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,125
Course not. I ate your
curry, so we're even.

189
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:07,958
Huh?

190
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,375
I'm kidding.

191
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,375
All the kids really
enjoyed it, though.

192
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,708
[MIKAELA chuckles]

193
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,083
So, what'd you have to do?

194
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,833
I mean, to get the curry.

195
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,250
Idiot.

196
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,583
Next time, we're
trading my blood.

197
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,250
[MIKAELA] Come on, nobody
wants your nasty blood.

198
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,416
[gasps]

199
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,250
[MIKAELA]
Kidding. Forget about it.

200
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,791
You need to focus on
defeating the vampires.

201
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,000
Just leave the rest to me.

202
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,333
[YUICHIRO]
Stop it!

203
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:37,125
You can't take on all
of the burden by yourself.

204
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,791
I'm not stupid.

205
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,041
I know how strong
the vampires are.

206
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,833
I know that beating
them is impossible--

207
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,500
[MIKAELA]
I don't wanna hear it.

208
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,958
These kids look up to you.

209
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,125
They hang on your every word.

210
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,708
"We can beat the fangs."

211
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,666
"We won't lose."
It gives them hope.

212
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,291
It gives all of us hope.

213
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,208
Now, let's get some grub.

214
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,541
Here. Make sure you
actually eat, this time.

215
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,041
[YUICHIRO] No, it's yours.
I don't want any.

216
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,333
[MIKAELA]
Too bad.

217
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,916
[MIKAELA chuckles] That's not
a request. It's an order.

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,666
Why do I have to take
orders from you?

219
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,375
'Cause, if you don't
keep your strength up,

220
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,333
you won't kill as many
fangs with this bad boy.

221
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,791
You're not done until you've
licked the bowl clean.

222
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,333
Whoa.

223
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:29,375
[MIKAELA] If you think that's
impressive, check this out.

224
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,208
Tadaa! A map of the city!

225
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,458
It even shows us where
all the exits are!

226
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,666
Hang on. Did you steal
this from the noble?

227
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,666
Ferid's mansion is
as big as a castle.

228
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,791
It took forever just
to find anything useful.

229
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,666
The great Mikaela doesn't
give his blood away

230
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,208
for a pat on the back.
He gets his dues.

231
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,166
Anyway, that all stops now.

232
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,041
We're leaving tonight.

233
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,750
[MIKAELA] I already know
what you're gonna say.

234
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,500
But don't worry, I've got
it all planned out.

235
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,958
Just leave it to
the Great Mikaela!

236
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,791
[YUICHIRO]
But what about the virus?

237
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,541
We could die as soon
as we get outside!

238
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:10,750
We won't get infected

239
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,916
as long as we're 13
or younger, remember?

240
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,166
Any idea how old we are now?

241
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,250
[YUICHIRO]
Twelve, I think?

242
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,416
Then that gives us a
whole year to find a cure.

243
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,958
I think we can do it.

244
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,208
As long as the Hyakuya
family works together,

245
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,833
everything'll turn out okay.

246
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,916
I can't figure out if
you really have a plan

247
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,833
or if you're just
making all this up.

248
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,583
I don't know, it sounds risky.

249
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:32,708
[AKANE]
What are you doing?

250
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:33,875
Huh?

251
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,416
Why are you still awake?

252
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,333
Oh! Mika! Hi.

253
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,458
You ate!

254
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,041
So what'd you think
of the curry, Yu?

255
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,750
Okay, Mika. Let's do it.

256
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,625
Great! Let's go!

257
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,541
Akane, go wake everybody up.

258
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,041
Why?

259
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,250
It's time we said
goodbye to this city!

260
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,750
[door thuds]

261
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,333
Clear.

262
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,750
[gasps]

263
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,291
[KIDS]
Wow!

264
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,125
[AKO]
Where are we going, anyway?

265
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,458
[FUMIE]
I don't like the dark.

266
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,291
[KOUTA] Won't we get in
trouble for being outside?

267
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,875
[MIKAELA]
Don't worry, it's fine.

268
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,291
It won't be long before we're
saying "bye-bye" to this world.

269
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,666
[FUMIE]
Huh? Why?

270
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,791
I don't get it,
where are we going?

271
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,791
Tell them, Yu.

272
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,500
We're going back to
the human world!

273
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,208
And guess what? We can
have curry every day!

274
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,375
[CHIHIRO]
Really?

275
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,541
[AKO] I wanna have
birthday cake every day!

276
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,458
What about hamburgers?

277
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,166
Sh.

[sighs]

279
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,166
It looks like
we're almost there.

280
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,458
All right! We're in
the final stretch!

281
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,416
[KIDS giggle, cheer]

282
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,583
Let's go.

283
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,041
Yeah!

284
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:15,458
[FERID chuckles]
Hello, little lambs.

285
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,750
I was beginning to
wonder if you'd show up.

286
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,458
[FERID]
Aw, just look at those faces.

287
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,083
I love the expression
humans make

288
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,083
when all of their hopes
have been dashed.

289
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:30,083
It's so intoxicating that I
can't stop playing this game.

290
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,958
What "game"?

291
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,375
[gasps]

292
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,958

[whimpering]

294
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,333
[FERID]
What a pity. It died so quickly.

295
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:54,500
[growls] Damn you!

296
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,833
[gasps]

297
00:17:56,916 --> 00:18:00,125
[FERID] Well, well. I believe
that is my pistol.

298
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:03,041
Sneaking it past me took a
cunning that few possess.

299
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,458
I'm impressed, Mika.

300
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,333
I never expected to be
this entertained.

301
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,791
It makes me hungry for more.

302
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,208
Does that fire of yours
need rekindling?

303
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,916
What if I told you that map you
stole was the genuine article?

304
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,833
All you have to do
is make it past me

305
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,666
and you'll be back
in your world.

306
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,291
It'll be hard to chase you
once you've made it outside.

307
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,250
The question is whether or
not you can make it there.

308
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,166
Get going!

309
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,125
[KIDS whimper]

310
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,625
Move it!

311
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,291
[KIDS scream]

312
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,125
Yes, that's it.

313
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,125
Go! We'll hold him off!

314
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,916
[KIDS screaming]

315
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,708
[gasps]

316
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,833
I'm begging you...

317
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,125
Leave them alone!

318
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,166

00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,625
Akane, run!

320
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,666
Let me savor the
misery as you lose

321
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,791
everything you hold dear.

322
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,583
[MIKAELA]
It's okay, Yu. Don't forget.

323
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:11,000
The two of us, we're family.

[YUICHIRO]
Hey!

326
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,375
[laughs] Sweet Mikaela.

327
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,500
I'll miss your
company most of all.

328
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,666
And the lovely meals.

329
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,875
[grunts]

330
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,708
Run... Yu.

[gasps]

332
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,583
Die.

334
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,000
Mika!

335
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:47,833
Hey! Look at me!

336
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,000
Go, Yu. Leave me here.

337
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,666
[YUICHIRO]
Don't be stupid!

338
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,291
We're going back
together! Remember?

339
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,791
Don't let us die for nothing.

340
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,458
Shut up! You're fine!

341
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,375
You're gonna
make it! Come on.

342
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:15,208
Mika, I can't leave, I can't!
I finally have a family!

343
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,375
[YUICHIRO]
I won't lose you!

344

[MIKAELA grunting]

345
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,083
Just go, you idiot! Now!

[YUICHIRO grunts]

349
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:48,291
That was, the first time
he called us family.

350
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:54,125

Good, he's here.

[gasps]

357
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,625
The prophecy was right.

358
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,750
It was foretold that we
would come into contact

359
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,750
with one of the test
subjects from Hyakuya Labs.

360
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,041
Hey, kid.

361
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,458
How would you like
to help us get rid

362
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,333
of the vampires
once and for all?

364

I'll do whatever it takes.

[YUICHIRO sobs]

367
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:06,375
[YUICHIRO] As long as I get to
kill every last one of 'em.

368
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,375
[YUICHIRO]
Next time, on Seraph of the End.
