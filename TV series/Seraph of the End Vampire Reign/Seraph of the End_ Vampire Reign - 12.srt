1
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,083
And so it begins.

2
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,291
[TROOPER A] Don't let them get
away! Kill all the vampires!

3
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:26,750
[GUREN] Well, I guess we got
the results we were after.

4
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:27,833
[SHINOA]
Lieutenant Colonel.

5
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,125
[GUREN]
Hm?

6
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:33,333
When this is over,
we have a lot to talk about.

7
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:36,916
It'd be smart for you to forget
everything you saw here.

8
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,083
That's an order.

9
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,666
Lieutenant Colonel!

10
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,125
[TROOPER B]
Stop right there, miss.

11
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,000
Unauthorized access to this
area's strictly prohibited.

12
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,916
I'm a member of the Japanese
Imperial Demon Army's

13
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,791
Vampire Extermination Unit.

14
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,416
Even if that's true,
it doesn't give you clearance.

15
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,125
This place is off
limits to anyone

16
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:15,291
ranked company officer or lower.

17
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,291
[SHINOA] What is the
purpose this facility?

18
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,750
[TROOPER B]
I'm afraid I can't divulge--

19
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,625
[TROOPER C] It's where they
run tests on the lab rats.

20
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:21,750
Hey!

21
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,666
[TROOPER C]
What're you worried about?

22
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,375
Every soldier in Shinjuku
knows about this place.

23
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,125
[SHINOA]
What do you mean by "lab rats"?

24
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,625
Scientists are doing research
on captured vampires.

25
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,375
They're lookin' for weaknesses.

26
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:37,500
So they're experimenting
on people here?

27
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:41,041
[TROOPER C] I don't think I'd
call those monsters "people."

28
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,541
Please, let me in.
I want some answers.

29
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,666
[TROOPER C] We told you,
this place is off limits.

30
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,083
Even if I have this?

31
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,041
The Hiragi family?

32
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,583
Uh...

33
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,791
[buzz, gate unlocks]

34
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,333
Thank you.

35
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,791
[TROOPER B]
Wait!

36
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,958
The Hiragi family controls
the entire Demon Army.

37
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,166
Which means you should have a
much higher rank than you do.

38
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,666
I guess I just like the
sound of "sergeant."

39
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,916
Besides, I don't
have much interest

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,166
in the silly power
struggle over rankings.

41
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,875
That's what killed
my sister, after all.

42
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,916
[PRISON VAMPIRE groans]

43
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,625
[door clicks]

44
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,500
So this is where you're hiding.

45
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,416
[GUREN]
Dammit.

46
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,208
I'm gonna kill those guards.

47
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,125
This won't take long.
I have a question.

48
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,708
[GUREN] I've got no answers.
Please, see yourself out.

49
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,958
Yu still hasn't
regained consciousness.

50
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,416
It's been five days.

51
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,375
What the hell did you
do to him? Or rather...

52
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:38,333
...what are you going to do
to him, Lieutenant Colonel?

53
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,750
[SHINOA] You ordered me to give
him a special drug combination

54
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,000
because his Cursed Gear
is so strong.

55
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,916
So I gave him these pills,
just like you asked.

56
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,458
They're to blame. The drugs
are why he lost control.

57
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,416
I'm right, aren't I?
Answer me, Lieutenant Colonel!

58
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,791
[GUREN chuckles]
It's not like you

59
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,916
to wear your emotions
on your sleeve.

60
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,666
You must be upset.

61
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,666
[GUREN]
What are you hoping I'll say?

62
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,791
That I have no idea what
you're talking about?

63
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,458
Or would you feel better if I
told you that you're delusional?

64
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,416
Neither! Just tell me
the truth about Yu!

65
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,625
[GUREN] Then don't get angry if
I mention human experimentation.

66
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,375
[gasps]

67
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,375
Think carefully now.

68
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,875
What would you do to ensure
the future of humanity?

69
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,458
How can we survive
in this ruined world?

70
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:31,666
And kill the Four Horsemen
of John? More importantly,

71
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,708
how do we completely
eradicate the vampires?

72
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,500
A human victory will
require sacrifice.

73
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,375
Just think how many people
died so your older sister,

74
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:44,541
Mahiru Hiragi, could
complete the Cursed Gear?

75
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,083
[SHINOA gasps]

76
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,791
[GUREN]
Sacrifice is the only reason

77
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,166
we have a fighting chance.

78
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,375
Don't let your feelings
for Yu get in the way

79
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,458
of remembering that.

80
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,541
[SHINOA]
Mm!

81
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,875
[GUREN chuckles]
You're blushing, Shinoa.

82
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,083
I don't care what goes on

83
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,916
between the two
of you privately.

84
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,583
But the army's plans for him are
not of your concern. Go away.

85
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,208
[SHINOA] But you haven't
answered my questions!

86
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,833
I said go.

87
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:17,375
[GUREN sighs] That drug
wears off in five days.

88
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,083
If you do have feelings for him,

89
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,416
then you should
stay by his side.

90
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,333
Be there when he opens his eyes.

91
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:53,000
[SHINOA]
Yu, please, you need to wake up.

92
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,250
For me.

93
00:07:55,333 --> 00:08:02,416
Ha... I'm not sure, but I think
I might be falling for you.

94
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,875
We need your help. Without you,
our squad's incomplete.

95
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,083
[SHINOA]
Wake up, for all of us.

96
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,000
[FERID]
It's time to retreat.

97
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:22,333
No. Let go of me!
I'm going to save Yu!

98
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,958
I know you must be upset,
but now's not a good time.

99
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,208
Take a look.

100
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,625
All of his human friends

101
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:33,041
will do absolutely
anything to protect him.

102

No...

filthy humans.

104
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes. Finally.

105
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,416
You're developing a proper
disgust for humanity.

106
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,000
[MIKAELA]
Shut up!

107
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:47,625
You hate vampires, and now
you're learning to hate humans.

108
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,916
I'm curious as to which
one you will choose.

109
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,083
I can't wait to find
out. Let's go home.

110
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,625
Don't touch me!

day. Now shut your mouth, Mika.

like he singled you out.

Hm. You're getting good
at the silent treatment.

[RENE]
Mm?

128

They suspect it's magic.

129
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,041
That the humans have discovered
a forbidden enchantment

130
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,250
that could destroy the world.

131
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:11,708
They called it "Seraph
of the End", I think.

132
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,750
Word is that our
attack on Shinjuku

133
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,291
was actually to retrieve
the enchantment.

134
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,750

the mission was a failure.

Lord Ferid was in charge.

00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:26,416
I never have any idea what's
really going on with him.

Sometimes I think he seems
happier when we fail.

You probably know more
about him than us, Mika.

That deviant always keeps
you within arm's reach.

your way into Krul's favor?

Tell us, Hyakuya.
What exactly is your story?

00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:22,833
[LACUS]
Hear that, Rene?

158
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,750
The queen's tugging on
her little pet's leash.

159
00:11:55,625 --> 00:12:00,708
[sighs]

160
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,166
[gasps]

161
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,500
Hey, Yoichi! Wake up!

162
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,041
What's going on?

163
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:23,333
[YOICHI sighs, gasps] Whoa,
you're awake! This is a miracle!

164
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,125
Why am I in a hospital?
The last thing I remember...

165
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:26,833
[YOICHI]
Thank goodness!

166
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,416
Hey! What about the--

167
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,833
Everyone'll want to know you're
up. I'll go tell 'em the news!

168
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,250
Uh? Wait, hold on a second!

169
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,541
What happened? Is everyone okay?

170
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:40,333
You sound worried.

171
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,083
It's no big deal.
I was just...

172
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,666
[YOICHI]
Everyone's fine.

173
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,583
You're the only one who we
thought might've been a goner.

174
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,083
That's good.

175
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,750
[YOICHI] You've actually been
in a coma for seven days.

176
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,708
Say what? Seven days?

177
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,916
I know. That's why I
gotta tell everyone.

178
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,083
[footsteps]

179
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,625
That's good. Nobody got hurt.

180
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,083
[sighs] What a relief.

181
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,000
Mika. That wasn't just a dream.

182
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,791
I can't believe
you're still alive.

183
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,791
All these years...
I can't believe it. Mika.

184
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:29,000
[YUICHIRO cries]

185
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,458
[SHINOA] Now here's a sight
I never expected to see.

186
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,916
[YUICHIRO gasps]

187
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,083
You're such a crybaby.

188
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,166
[SHINOA laughs]
It's understandable.

189
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,500
Of course you're gonna
shed some tears.

190
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,125
You just found out
your family's alive.

191
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,666
I'm glad you're awake.

192
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,041
We were all really worried
after what happened.

193
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,916
I don't know what happened.

194
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,833
It's a blank. Mika's the
last thing that I remember.

195
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,041
You're sure you can't
recall anything else?

196
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,375
Nothing.

197
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Interesting.

198
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,750
Well, you said you were sleepy,

199
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,833
and then you laid down
on the battlefield.

200
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,500
Huh? Are you kidding me?

201
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,375
[SHINOA]
Of course!

202
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,500
Uh.

203
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:26,291
Actually, you were
knocked unconscious.

204
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,708
Our squadron was
getting flattened.

205
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:32,250
But then our reinforcements
showed up. The main unit

206
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:36,041
led by Lieutenant General Kureto
and Major General Shinya.

207
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,291
They drove the enemy back.

208
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,583
[YUICHIRO]
And what about the vampires?

209
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,125
Did they all get away?

210
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,750
No nobles were captured,

211
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,291
but we killed a lot of
the normal vampires.

212
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,000
We even took a few
of them as prisoners.

213
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:55,333
Still. We allowed too
many of them to escape.

214
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,500
What happened to--

215
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,125
[SHINOA] You wanna
know about your friend.

216
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,916
Did he escape?

217
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,958
Look, about Mika...

218
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,833
[YUICHIRO]
Just come out and say it.

219
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,291
Whether he's my
friend or my enemy,

220
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:12,208
I have to know what happened.
If he's alive or not.

221
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,416
So what happened to him
when I lost consciousness?

222
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,791
You won't like this.

223
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:26,416
But, he was taken
by the vampires.

224
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,166
Are you sure?

225
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,833
[SHINOA]
Yes.

226
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:33,666
I understand. Thanks Shinoa.

227
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,750
Just keep your cool.
You still need to recover.

228
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,250
So don't even think
about going off

229
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,875
and raiding the vampire city.

230
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,708
Don't worry, I'll stay put.

231
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,208
Knowing that Mika's
alive is enough for me.

232
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,375
At least, for now.

233
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,708
I'm happy to hear that.

234
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:59,000
[KIMIZUKI]
I can carry him to safety.

235
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,833
Where can we go to regroup?

236
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:04,416
Let's get him to the
temporary base. Hurry!

237
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:20,750
[SHINOA] Yu and Mika.
They were family first.

238
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,333
[YUICHIRO]
Hey.

239
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,875
Uh. Yeah, what?

240
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,375
Thanks for worrying
about me. Seriously.

241
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:34,125
Oh. Of course.

242
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,708
[YUICHIRO]
Mm. Shinoa.

243
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:37,708
[SHINOA gasps]

244
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,791
Uh... What are you...

245
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:45,833
What's this? Were you injured?

246
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:50,458
[gasps] Oh, the bandage.
That's what this is about.

247
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:54,708
I'm okay now, but one of the
vampires took a little sip.

248
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,916
So, you're finally awake!
It took you long enough.

249
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,958
Uh! Uh...

250
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,458
Uh.

251
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:05,666
What the hell?

252
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,916
What do you think
you're doing with him?

253
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,625
[SHINOA yelps]

254
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,625
No, It's not what
you think, Mitsu!

255
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,708
[laughs] I was just
explaining to him

256
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,333
that a vampire bit
me the other day.

257
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,166
Uh!

258
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,625
Hold up, you've got
a bandage, too?

259
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,625
Are you okay?

260
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:27,083
Huh?! Uh... Yeah.
I'm fine, thanks.

261
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,041
Learn to use your inside
voice. You're in a hospital.

262
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,208
[MITSUBA]
Who do you think you are?

263
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,791
He looks just fine to me.

264
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,125
Did you enjoy your little nap?

265
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,750
Were you concerned?

266
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,333
Huh? Why would I waste
my valuable time

267
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,083
worrying about you, dumbass?

268
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:43,125
Don't try to act tough.
We all know you were worried.

269
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:46,041
After all, you spent quite a bit
of time sitting by his bed.

270
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,458
[KIMIZUKI grunts]

271
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,208
What? Okay, now you're
just makin' stuff up!

272
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,291
I was never in here
watching him sleep.

273
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,833
[YOICHI] I thought you
said not to tell him

274
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:54,875
about watching him sleep?

275
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,208
[KIMIZUKI]
Shut up!

276
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,208
[laughs]

277
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,750
Hey. Listen up, guys.
I wanna say something.

278
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,208
What?

279
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,333
Spit it out.

280
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,291
Sure.

281
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,333
Go on.

282
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,875
[sighs]

283
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:18,083
It's no big. I just wanted
to say, thank you.

284
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:22,000
And to apologize for
sleeping so long.

285
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:25,791
Ya know, I'm lucky
to have all of you.

286
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,750
[YOICHI, KIMIZUKI gasp]

287
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,833
[MITSUBA, SHINOA gasp]

288
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,958
[KIMIZUKI]
Call a doctor. He obviously

289
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,416
still needs medical attention.

290
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,208
[MITSUBA] Yep. He definitely
hit his head or something.

291
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,500
[YOICHI] I don't think so.
Yu's actually been a good guy

292
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,750
from the beginning.

293
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,416
[SHINOA] Well, I hope he
hasn't lost his nerve.

294
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,833
He's starting to sound pathetic.

295
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,000
[YUICHIRO] I'm gonna
kick all of your asses!

296
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,708
Anyway, you've got
plenty of time to rest.

297
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,666
It's good that we get a
little downtime to heal.

298
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,333
What do you mean?

299
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,958
That's right. We're on
hiatus until you recover.

300
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:05,041
The Shinoa Hiragi Squad
is taking a break.

301
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,750
[YUICHIRO]
A break, huh?

302
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,458
[SHINOA] I know you're probably
anxious to go after Mika,

303
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,333
but you'll need to regain
your strength first.

304
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,875
[YUICHIRO]
You're right.

305
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,500
I'll take it easy and
behave for the time being.

306
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,958
I don't wanna cause
any more trouble.

307
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,750
Any requests? I'm gonna go
pick up some drinks for us.

308
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,458
[SHINOA]
That's our Kimizuki!

309
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,791
Always trying to take
care of his family.

310
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,583
[KIMIZUKI]
Psh. Never mind.

311
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,875
Wait, I'll come with you.
You only have two hands.

312
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,333
[SHINOA] And on the opposite end
of the spectrum, we have Mitsu,

313
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,708
who doesn't have a
nurturing bone in her body.

314
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:49,916
Ah! Hold it right there!

315
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,250
I don't exactly see
you playing team mom.

316
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:56,333
[giggles] I don't have to,
because I'm the team leader.

317
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,208
[YUICHIRO] None of my
friends got seriously hurt.

318
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,791
Mika is still alive.

319
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,708
It's unbelievable.

320
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:39,875
Why are so many good
things happening to me?

321
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:45,333
He's out there somewhere,
and I'll find him again.

322
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,833
Mika.

323
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,333
[MIKAELA]
Yu.

324
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,625
[YUICHIRO]
I'll do whatever it takes.

325
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:02,000
[MIKAELA]
I swear on everything.

326
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,916
[MIKAELA, YUICHIRO]
I'll save you.

327
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,791
[door creaks, slams]

328
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,541
[FERID]
Don't you find it amusing

329
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,416
that things seem to be
going so smoothly?

330
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,083
As usual, the human's lust
for power is out of control,

331
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:53,375
and we vampires are so arrogant
that we take things too lightly.

332
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,125
Wouldn't you agree with me,
or does my partner

333
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,958
see things differently?

334
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,583
--You're so serious.
--[footsteps]

335
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:04,583
Here you go. All of
our research data.

336
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,833
One more thing. I almost forgot.

337
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,500
[FERID chuckles]

338
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,833
[door slams]
