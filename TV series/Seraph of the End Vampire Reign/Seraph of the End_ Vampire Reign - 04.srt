We're only in trouble

There's no way we could beat the
vampires in a frontal assault.

Outsmarting them is
the only way to go.

I actually have an
escape plan already.

to be visited by our beloved

Why, thank you.

And your grin is just as smug
and nauseating as I recall.

How cruel. Here I am with a
gunshot wound to my head,

You were attacked and
injured by human children?

You're a seventh progenitor

were that funny, Ferid.

But now one of my
seraphs has escaped.

And the other one is dying,
barely clinging to life.

If you have any
explanation for your actions,

now would be the time
for you to start--

plenty of explaining

to do yourself,
don't you, my Queen?

100

You've been fiddling with
the curse of the seraphs

101
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,833
and that's against the law.

00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,791
[SHINOA]
The two of you are late.

159
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,500
[YUICHIRO]
Hm...?

160
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,166
Whatever. We're here now.

161
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,250
[SHINOA] Looks like someone
pummeled your face.

162
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,625
Is another suspension in order?

163
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,208
[YUICHIRO] It was an
accident, not a fight.

164
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,125
Well, all right, if you say so.

165
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,916
Besides, we've got much bigger
things on our plate today.

166
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,458
Yeah! I'm so psyched.

167
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,916
After all this waiting, we
finally get to start training

168
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,833
to become members of
the Moon Demon Company.

169
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,833
[YUICHIRO] You already know
I don't need any training.

170
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,416
Save us all some time
and just put me in action.

171
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,375
I'd be fine with that.
But if you're not willing

172
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,375
to put in the time to
go through training,

173
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,958
you're gonna fight
without gear or a uniform.

174
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,750
[YUICHIRO] I'm not killing
vampires buck naked.

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,916
Excuse me, everyone!

176
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,166
[SHIOA]
I brought these two slow-pokes

177
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,958
with me, Lieutenant Colonel.

178
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,166
[SHINOA]
Uh... sir?

179
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,000
[grunts] Fine....Ugh...

180
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,458
Time to get started.

181
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,750
The reason I'm making a rare
appearance in class today

182
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,791
is because we've got a
couple of transfer students

183
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,541
I want to introduce you to.

184
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,250
[SHINOA] You know,
just for your information...

185
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,541
The supervising teacher

186
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,500
should probably be coming
to class every day.

187
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,458
Why don't you mind
your own business?

188
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:59,083
So, anyway, as I was saying,
these are the transfers.

189
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,166
Yuichiro Hyakuya
and Yoichi Saotome.

190
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,500
Though it might be easier

191
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,458
to remember them as
"the idiot" and "the wuss."

192
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,583
You're calling me an idiot?

193
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:11,125
Well, it's the truth. Now, go
ahead and introduce yourselves.

194
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,000
---[YUICHIRO] Why bother?
--[GUREN gasps]

195
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:16,416
I don't care about any of the
other people in this class.

196
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,625
I'm not here to be liked
or "make friends."

197
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:19,875
You weaklings can piss off

198
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,333
and become vampire
food for all I care.

199
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,583
Whoa, what's gotten into you?

200
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,208
Let's make one thing clear.

201
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,791
I don't know which
one of you losers

202
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,583
was the best in class till now,
but you can kiss that goodbye.

203
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,375
The strongest
Cursed Gear is mine.

204
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,416
I shouldn't even be
wasting my time here.

205
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,083
I deserve to be in the company!

206
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,166
No, you "deserve" this!

207
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,208
[YUICHIRO yelps]

208
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,833
[YUICHIRO groans]

209
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,041
[GUREN]
I don't know what you learned

210
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,416
in that general ed class,

211
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,833
but here we work
together as a team.

212
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,500
Ugh. Thought you might've
learned your place by now.

213
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,333
Go on. Take a seat
in the back row.

214
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,375
[YUICHIRO]
Tch.

215
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,500
[YUICHIRO] Stupid Guren.
Thinks he knows everything.

216
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,958
[YUICHIRO]
Hm?

217
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,833
Hey, move your feet.

218
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,125
This is where the
Lieutenant Colonel said

219
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm supposed to sit.

220
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,541
You listening?
Time to get movin'.

221
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:13,166
Can't you see that I'm tryin'
to sleep? Ugh. Back off. Uh?

222
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,458
[gasps]

223
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,125
[gasps]

224
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,333
So we meet again,
telephone pole.

225
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,125
What're you doing here?

226
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,458
I could ask you the
same question, ya twerp.

227
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,750
And whaddaya mean
"telephone pole?"

228
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:25,958
--[YUICHIRO] You're the one...
--What's the story

229
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,333
with those two? Kimizuki
was starting to seem

230
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,958
friendlier and less volatile,

231
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,625
but seeing Yuichiro just
completely set him off.

232
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,833
I thought you were
working on them.

233
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,166
[KIMIZUKI and YUICHIRO grunting]

234
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,791
Very diligently.

235
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,500
[GUREN]
And the result?

236
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,583
This is a marked improvement.

237
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,791
[GUREN] You were supposed
to keep close watch over them.

238
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,500
[SHINOA]
But I did watch them, sir.

239
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,791
This morning, Kimizuki attacked
Hyakuya to test his ability

240
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:52,041
and maintain his alpha
dominance over the students.

241
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:55,333
And? Did you step in
and break up the fight?

242
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,500
Actually I stayed in hiding
and enjoyed the show.

243
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,916
I'm beginning to think you're
not very good at your job.

244
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,916
[BOTH grunting]

245
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,166
Enough of this!

246
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,750
[BOTH yelp, grunt]

247
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,166
Uh! Are they okay?

248
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,916
They'll be fine. Let's
get to work, everyone.

249
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,625
Maybe I can teach the
rest of you something.

250
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,000
[knocking]

251
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,125
[door clicks]

252
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,791
[KIMIZUKI]
Lieutenant Colonel Ichinose?

253
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:36,166
I don't mean to intrude.
But do you have time to talk?

254
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,791
[GUREN] No. And don't come
in here without permission.

255
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,041
I just have a question about

256
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,708
the Cursed Gear Aptitude
Test a week from now.

257
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,708
On that day, I'll be
given the chance

258
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,791
to try out for the top-ranked
"Black Demon Series," right?

259
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,416
You're starting to
wear out your welcome.

260
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,250
My grades are better
than everyone else's.

261
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,250
I'm the strongest
student in class.

262
00:13:56,541 --> 00:14:00,041
[GUREN] Why is it so important
for you have that kind of power?

263
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,375
The army does background
checks on all of us.

264
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,833
I'm sure you've read the files
on each potential recruit.

265
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:08,458
Yeah. I know all about your
history. You've got a sister

266
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,666
who's been infected
with the Apocalypse Virus,

267
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,166
and now you're
looking for a cure.

268
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,000
[KIMIZUKI gasps]

269
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,083
[GUREN]
I understand your intentions.

270
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,500
There are certain
perks that come

271
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,833
with being a member of
the Moon Demon Company.

272
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,541
Things like unlimited
medical treatments

273
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:27,458
that are unavailable
to the rest of the public.

274
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:31,416
Unfortunately, you still got a
lot of training to go through.

275
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,583
In your current state,

276
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,416
you couldn't even
touch the Cursed Gear.

277
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,416
It would feed off of
your desire for a cure,

278
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,333
and eventually, consume you.

279
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,916
Hah. But I bet that you're going

280
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,583
to let Hyakuya try out any
weapon he wants, aren't you?

281
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,500
That all remains to be seen.

282
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,291
Although he has
shown some talent.

283
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,625
He's even broken free
from a demon once already.

284
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,833
Uh--

285
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,166
And, despite his attitude,

286
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,500
he's someone who looks
out for his friends.

287
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:59,708
That's bullshit! I'm way
stronger than he'll ever be.

288
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:03,041
Strength isn't everything.
You need to learn that.

289
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,458
Make some friends,
form a support system.

290
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,458
Stop taking everything
on yourself. Otherwise...

291
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,541
[GUREN] When you find yourself
face-to-face with a demon,

292
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,916
you'll have no chance
of controlling it.

293
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,375
[gasps]

294

[gasps]

296
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,666
Demons feast upon
desperation and rage.

297
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,250
If you attempted a contract now,

298
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,291
you'd be swallowed whole
and never find your way out.

[gasps]

300
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,875
Hi, everyone!
Listen up, students.

301
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,958
In preparation for next week's
Cursed Gear Aptitude Test,

302
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,708
I will be assessing
all of your abilities.

303
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,708
If you can't show me
you're ready here,

304
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,000
then you'll have
to keep training

305
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,666
and take the test
at a later date.

306
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,166
So do your best, okay?

307
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,708
That's a lot of pressure.

308
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,208
Whatever happens,

309
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,291
I'm gonna kick ass and prove
that I'm the strongest here.

310
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,458

Go ahead. Everyone, choose
a partner to work with.

Please keep training.

[YUICHIRO]
Hey, what are you doing?

If your sister is dying,

you don't have time to stand
around here apologizing--

Look, this doesn't concern you.

My goal is to impress everyone
in this training exercise.

That's the only
thing that matters.

Then you're
abandoning your sister.

you can ignore.

If your sister were to die,

there when she needed you.

We're in the clear.

It looks like she's going
to pull through for now.

374
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,791
But the equipment we have here
isn't made to combat this virus.

I understand, Doc. But soon,

376
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,208
I'll be joining the
Moon Demon Company.

377
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,083
Then I can transfer her
over to the army facility.

00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:31,666
Please, take care of her
just a little while longer.

she ended up being okay.

Who'd've thought? You walk
around acting like a badass,

but it turns out you're
doing it all for your sister.

382
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,500
You should have just
told me about her.

That being said,

evaluation because of you.

388
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,166
I won't be eligible to join the
Company, and because of that,

389
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,208
my sister won't be saved.

390
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:08,083
Only a coward would give up
on her life so easily.

391
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,916
Pick yourself up, and start
fighting for what you want.

That's what I'm gonna do,

393
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,458
and nothing as small as a bad
evaluation is gonna stop me.

If I'm being honest,

I don't even need
the Moon Demon Company.

I'd still fight all by myself,

on your family, just like that?

with my sister.

into leaving the training room.

I owe you an apology
