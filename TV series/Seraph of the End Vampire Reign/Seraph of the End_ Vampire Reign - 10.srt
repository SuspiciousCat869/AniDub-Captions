1
01:00:39,208 --> 01:00:41,083
[SHINOA]
We fell through to the subway.

2
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:42,750
[YUICHIRO]
Yeah.

3
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:44,000
[SHINOA]
Where are the others?

4
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:45,791
[YUICHIRO]
I don't think they fell with us.

5
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:48,791
But the corporal here is
banged up pretty badly.

6
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:50,625
[SHINOA] We need to get
him to the temporary shelter

7
01:00:50,708 --> 01:00:52,083
above ground.

8
01:00:52,166 --> 01:00:54,750
There should be medics there
who can treat his wounds.

9
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:58,583
[KIMIZUKI]
Hey! Idiot! You down there?

10
01:00:58,666 --> 01:01:00,583
I can hear ya. You okay?

11
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:02,750
[MITSUBA]
Yeah, of course we are!

12
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:07,000
There's no way we'd die in
a place like this. Dumbass.

13
01:01:07,083 --> 01:01:10,375
Hey, can you guys get out?

14
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,875
Yeah, no problem!

15
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:14,541
Then you guys go ahead
and we'll catch up with you.

16
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:16,625
We've gotta find a med
team for the corporal.

17
01:01:16,708 --> 01:01:19,875
We'll meet you at
the defensive line!

18
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:22,875
Wait! Shouldn't we...

19
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:24,791
'Kay, see you at the line.

20
01:01:38,791 --> 01:01:41,250
[rumbling]

21
01:02:09,583 --> 01:02:11,000
[GUREN]
Well, dammit.

22
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:13,875
I didn't kill the
commander after all.

23
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:18,666
[FERID chuckles]
Impressive.

24
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:21,833
That attack took out a whole
squadron of our men.

25
01:02:21,916 --> 01:02:23,500
It looks like the
humans are sending in

26
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:25,083
their strongest forces.

27
01:02:25,166 --> 01:02:26,875
Strongest forces?

28
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:29,666
[FERID] These soldiers are with
the Vampire Extermination Unit's

29
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,208
most elite squad.

30
01:02:31,291 --> 01:02:34,000
The Moon Demon Company.

31
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,875
All right, everyone.

32
01:02:38,541 --> 01:02:42,750
[FERID] Are you ready to end
this war once and for all?

33
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:44,958
Then let's slaughter
the livestock.

34
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:47,416
Full-blown extermination.

35
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,541
[GUREN]
Let me ask you somethin'.

36
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:54,666
Do you really like the
taste of human blood?

37
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:58,000
Or is this a twisted reenactment
of the Last Supper?

38
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:03,833
Lend me your power.

39
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:06,333
Demon Blade: Mahiru-no-yo.

40
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:09,375
[GUREN]
Don't hold back!

41
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:12,666
This is the fight that
you've been training for.

42
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:14,750
Protect this line.

43
01:03:16,208 --> 01:03:18,208
Kill every one of 'em.

44
01:05:07,708 --> 01:05:09,625
[AKANE] C'mon, slowpokes,
it's time to go!

45
01:05:09,708 --> 01:05:11,250
[KIDS]
Okay!

46
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:14,000
We're heading out, so you guys
hold down the fort, all right?

47
01:05:14,083 --> 01:05:14,791
[YUICHIRO]
Sure.

48
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:16,291
[MIKAELA]
Have fun!

49
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:18,708
[AKO]
Bye-bye!

50
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:20,541
[TAICHI]
See ya later!

51
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,916
[KOUTA] Lunch time is my
favorite time of day!

52
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,500
[AKO]
I'm so hungry!

53
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:25,916
[TAICHI]
My stomach's rumbling!

54
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,375
[AKANE]
Careful, now.

55
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:29,958
You're gonna trip over
someone if you rush like that.

56
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:31,750
[door creaks]

57
01:05:31,833 --> 01:05:33,291
[MIKAELA]
Hey, Yu. What's up?

58
01:05:33,375 --> 01:05:34,666
Can't you see
that I'm reading?

59
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:36,583
[MIKAELA] Aw, c'mon,
take a break for a sec.

60
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:39,416
What is with you?
You're being annoying.

61
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,875
If we could escape from this
place, what would you wanna do?

62
01:05:42,958 --> 01:05:44,291
Where would you wanna go?

63
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:45,708
Huh?

64
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:47,583
Did you hit your
head or somethin'?

65
01:05:47,666 --> 01:05:49,583
We can't escape 'cause
the virus would kill us

66
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:51,666
as soon as we got outside.

67
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:53,875
[MIKAELA]
Use your imagination.

68
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:55,750
If we could escape
to the outside

69
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:57,458
with the rest of the family.

70
01:05:57,541 --> 01:05:59,666
If we could go to a place
without any vampires,

71
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:02,791
then don't you think
we would have fun?

72
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:05,666
Without vampires?

73
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:08,041
[MIKAELA]
Yeah, just us family.

74
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:10,750
Sure, that sounds great,
but it's impossible.

75
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:11,833
[MIKAELA]
You'd be happy?

76
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:13,375
Yeah, of course I would.

77
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:17,208
[chuckles] Then I guess I'd
better get busy working on that.

78
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:18,208
On what?

79
01:06:18,291 --> 01:06:20,541
[MIKAELA]
Mm-mm! It's a secret.

80
01:06:20,625 --> 01:06:23,708
Well. I've got some
errands I need to run.

81
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:27,333
Errands? What do you have to do?

82
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:30,250
[MIKAELA] If I told you,
it'd ruin the surprise.

83
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:31,833
Uh...

84
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:34,666
What a weirdo.

85
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:38,958
[YUICHIRO]
Unfortunately,

86
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:41,791
Mika didn't escape the
way he thought he would.

87
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,458
[YUICHIRO] And it turned out the
world beyond was no paradise.

88
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:58,125
We should go meet the others.

89
01:06:58,208 --> 01:06:59,500
But the corporal...

90
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:00,833
He'll be fine here.

91
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:03,250
The doctors say he's
going to recover

92
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:06,500
That's good. I'm glad.

93
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:09,291
Besides, Lieutenant
Colonel Guren has issued

94
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:11,250
some new orders
for our squadron.

95
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:13,666
[YUICHIRO gasps]
Guren's in Shinjuku?

96
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:15,166
That's right.

97
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:18,166
He's reorganizing our
troops within the city.

98
01:07:23,583 --> 01:07:25,541
The Lieutenant Colonel
is already ahead of us

99
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,833
at West Shinjuku
and Fifth Street.

100
01:07:27,916 --> 01:07:31,250
He's been fighting the
vampires' main forces there.

101
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:33,541
We need to go back him up.

102
01:07:33,625 --> 01:07:36,208
The main forces.
If we can crush them,

103
01:07:36,291 --> 01:07:39,333
then the vampires will be
defeated and we'll win this.

104
01:07:39,416 --> 01:07:40,250
[SHINOA]
They're probably thinking

105
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:42,166
the same thing about us.

106
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:46,041
If they crush the Moon Demon
Company, victory is theirs.

107
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:48,708
We should get moving.
Mitsu and the others

108
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:52,000
have probably made it to
the defensive line by now.

109
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,416
[COMMANDER 9A]
I told you, it's not possible!

110
01:07:58,291 --> 01:07:59,416
[COMMANDER 9A]
Our orders are to send

111
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,291
everyone we've got to
the defensive line.

112
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:04,416
If the vampires get through
there, Shinjuku will fall.

113
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,333
But our troops are
gonna be wiped out here

114
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:07,416
if we don't help them.

115
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,666
So send in the
Extermination Unit.

116
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:12,583
They're teenaged kids and
there's only three of them!

117
01:08:12,666 --> 01:08:15,541
I thought they were supposed
to have five members.

118
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:17,458
The enemy has sent a
high-ranking platoon

119
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:18,833
--to annihilate them.
--[SHINOA] Hey, Yu, wait!

120
01:08:18,916 --> 01:08:22,958
They're going to die.
It's only a matter of time.

121
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:25,500
[sighs] All right, fine.

122
01:08:25,583 --> 01:08:27,541
I can spare a few men.
Tell me the location of--

123
01:08:27,625 --> 01:08:29,416
What were you saying?

124
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,083
That Extermination Unit.

125
01:08:31,166 --> 01:08:32,666
Was it The Moon Demon Company?

126
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:35,541
[TROOPER 10A]
Um, I dunno. Maybe?

127
01:08:35,625 --> 01:08:37,000
Why, who are you?

128
01:08:37,083 --> 01:08:38,416
[SHINOA]
We're part of the Moon Demon--

129
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,916
[YUICHIRO] Wait. You said
there were three of them.

130
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,708
Is it a girl and two guys?

131
01:08:41,791 --> 01:08:43,708
Yeah, are you
with them or what?

132
01:08:43,791 --> 01:08:45,250
[YUICHIRO] Look, I just
need you to tell me

133
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:46,500
where they're fighting.

134
01:08:46,583 --> 01:08:48,500
[TROOPER 10A] They're at
Shinjuku Central Park.

135
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:49,583
[YUICHIRO]
All right.

136
01:08:49,666 --> 01:08:51,041
We're gonna go help them.

137
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:53,750
Send everyone else to the
defensive line, got it?

138
01:08:53,833 --> 01:08:54,666
Let's go.

139
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:56,416
Hey! Wait a minute!

140
01:08:59,166 --> 01:09:00,916
[SHINOA]
You're not thinking clearly.

141
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,458
You can't even be sure that he
was talking about our squad.

142
01:09:04,541 --> 01:09:07,291
We can't ignore our orders
based on speculation.

143
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:09,000
We're needed as backup.

144
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:11,250
That's our top priority.

145
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:13,625
Even Lieutenant Colonel Guren
will have a hard time

146
01:09:13,708 --> 01:09:16,666
going up against the
vampires' strongest forces.

147
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:19,625
We have to maintain
Shinjuku's defensive line.

148
01:09:19,708 --> 01:09:21,958
Guren is counting
on us to be there.

149
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:24,083
So are the rest of his troops.

150
01:09:42,125 --> 01:09:45,291
[GUREN yelling]

151
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:54,916
[TROOPERS yelling]

152
01:10:05,875 --> 01:10:07,958
[hisses]

153
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:09,625
[GUREN grunts]

154
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:14,583
There's no end to
these bloodsuckers.

155
01:10:14,666 --> 01:10:16,708
Mito and I can
keep them occupied

156
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:18,833
while you go after
the commander.

157
01:10:18,916 --> 01:10:21,500
When did you get so
good at strategizing?

158
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:23,000
Let's do it.

159
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:32,041
This fight's finally
getting interesting.

160
01:10:32,125 --> 01:10:34,625
It's a shame that Crowley,
the Thirteenth Progenitor,

161
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:36,291
isn't here. He would
make this a battle

162
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:39,083
truly worthy of
the history books.

163
01:10:39,166 --> 01:10:41,375
He's really missing out.

164
01:10:41,458 --> 01:10:43,208
Lacus. Rene.

165
01:10:43,291 --> 01:10:45,250
Round up our men and
take down all the humans

166
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:47,291
except for the one in charge.

167
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:48,458
Sir.

168
01:10:48,541 --> 01:10:50,166
Consider it done.

169
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,291
Well, Mika.

170
01:10:56,375 --> 01:10:58,291
Maybe now I'll finally
get a chance to see

171
01:10:58,375 --> 01:11:02,125
Krul Tepes's favorite
servant in action.

172
01:11:02,208 --> 01:11:04,250
You must be very thirsty.

173
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:05,583
[MIKAELA grunts]

174
01:11:08,458 --> 01:11:11,833
You and I can kill their
pompous leader together.

175
01:11:11,916 --> 01:11:13,416
What do ya say?

176
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:16,625
I can do this on my own.

177
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:20,000
Think so? Then he's all yours.

178
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:22,208
He will regret coming
to attack me.

179
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:24,625
It will be his undoing.

180
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:25,875
My sword.

181
01:11:27,791 --> 01:11:30,666
Oh. How intimidating.

182
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:49,500
I think we're
almost there, Yu!

183
01:11:49,583 --> 01:11:50,708
Yeah!

184
01:11:54,583 --> 01:11:55,500
[YUICHIRO]
Thank you.

185
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:56,708
[SHINOA]
Hm?

186
01:11:56,791 --> 01:11:58,583
[YUICHIRO]
For coming.

187
01:11:58,666 --> 01:12:00,375
Well, we are a family.

188
01:12:00,458 --> 01:12:03,250
And it's just like Lieutenant
Colonel Guren told us.

189
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:06,250
We have to protect
each other, no matter what.

190
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:11,083
--[SHINOA] Idiot.
--What?

191
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:12,666
That's what he would call you.

192
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:15,250
[YUICHIRO]
Heh. He probably would.

193
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:20,291
[SHINOA] There it is.
Shinjuku Central Park.

Huh?

01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:42,791

[VAMPIRE grunts, groans]

203
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,750
[pants] Are we really this weak

204
01:13:05,833 --> 01:13:09,000
without shorty and the
dumbass backing us up?

205
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:11,416
We can't complete a
formation without them.

207

Kimizuki! Watch your back!

211
01:13:26,375 --> 01:13:27,416
Goodbye.

Look, it's Yu!

[SHINOA] Don't get distracted
on the battlefield, Mitsu.

216
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:50,083
Where are the rest
of the vampires?

217
01:13:50,166 --> 01:13:51,583
They're all dead, genius.

218
01:13:51,666 --> 01:13:54,958
Actually, you just killed
the last one of 'em.

219
01:13:55,041 --> 01:13:56,625
[YUICHIRO]
Huh?

220
01:14:02,916 --> 01:14:05,166
[gasps] Well, damn, you guys.

221
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:08,083
Looks like you're pretty
amazing after all.

222
01:14:08,166 --> 01:14:11,125
You must've forgotten how
good I am at killing vamps.

223
01:14:11,208 --> 01:14:14,083
Hey, shouldn't you
be backing up Guren?

224
01:14:14,166 --> 01:14:15,666
[YUICHIRO]
What are you talking about?

225
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:18,041
I heard you were in a tight
spot, so I came to make sure

226
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:19,958
you didn't get
backed into a corner.

227
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:22,083
You didn't need to do that.

228
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:26,041
Besides, we said we'd meet
you at the defensive line.

229
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:27,833
That was your plan.

230
01:14:27,916 --> 01:14:29,875
Sure, that was the plan.

231
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:31,750
But I just thought...

232
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:33,166
What? That we would fail?

233
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:34,750
Did you honestly
think we didn't

234
01:14:34,833 --> 01:14:38,041
have the strength and training
to take down an enemy platoon?

235
01:14:41,166 --> 01:14:43,833
You've gotta learn
to trust your family.

236
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:53,041
You're right. My bad.

237
01:14:53,125 --> 01:14:54,291
[KIMIZUKI]
Yeah, well,

238
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:56,750
don't go making the same
mistake in the future.

239
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:58,125
Okay?

240
01:14:58,208 --> 01:15:01,791
Sorry but if it was to
happen again tomorrow,

241
01:15:01,875 --> 01:15:03,875
I'd still come running.

242
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:04,958
You what?

243
01:15:05,041 --> 01:15:07,375
Did you hear anything
I just said?

244
01:15:07,458 --> 01:15:10,583
It's not that I don't trust you
or think that you're weak.

245
01:15:10,666 --> 01:15:12,291
It's just that I care.

[KIMIZUKI grunts]

247
01:15:14,208 --> 01:15:15,833

I'd do it tomorrow.

I must've forgotten what a
hardcore dumbass you can be.

251

You shouldn't bother wasting
your breath with him, Kimizuki.

You can't fix his
brand of stupid.

You're right.

the dumber he gets.

Oh, come on, guys!

The sun is finally out.

Now that we've
cleaned out the park,

260
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:47,666
we should probably
catch up with Guren.

261
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:48,541
Yeah, you're right.

262
01:15:48,625 --> 01:15:50,833
And we can go as a full squad!

263
01:15:51,958 --> 01:15:53,833
[SHINOA]
Ready, Yu?

264
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:55,375
Hell yeah, let's move!

265
01:15:55,458 --> 01:15:58,541

Well, well. You're a strong one.

A challenge, at last.

that you will win.

I thought that you'd be faster.

01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:24,541
I evaded the blast...

And besides, do you really
think old school spell craft

280

works on vampires?

[FERID chuckles]
Mika. Just as I expected.

Tremendous power
and overconfidence.

If you're not careful,
that arrogance will get the rug

I'll lose against him.

01:17:52,416 --> 01:17:54,083
to fight us one-on-one.

01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:55,916
They've caught on, Shigure.

292

Remember, Mika.

309

It's always a mistake to
underestimate the livestock.

310
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:06,875
There's nothing honorable
about the way

these greedy little
blood bags fight.

Although, I guess you
know all about that

as an ex-human yourself.

314

Shut up.

Ha! Well.

316
01:19:16,833 --> 01:19:19,375
We should probably get
serious about this.

Let's fight together.

I don't need your help.

of my blood.

321
01:19:30,958 --> 01:19:34,000
Heh... There's that
arrogance again.

322
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:36,208
It's an unfortunate holdover
from your humanity

323
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:38,833
that's going to get
you in trouble one day.

324
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:54,250
Looks like I'll have to take
two pills to pull this one off.

325
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:56,375
Don't risk it,
Lieutenant Colonel!

326
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:58,625
Distraction will get
you killed, little girl.

327
01:19:58,708 --> 01:19:59,708
Speak for yourself.

328
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:00,750
[gasps]

329
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:08,916
[gasps] Oh, wow.

330
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,958
Not bad.

331
01:20:11,041 --> 01:20:12,583
[SAYURI]
Please! Put the pills away!

332
01:20:12,666 --> 01:20:14,541
If you die of shock from
taking two of them,

333
01:20:14,625 --> 01:20:15,958
then you can't lead us.

334
01:20:16,041 --> 01:20:19,708
But if I don't take 'em,
we'll all end up dead.

335
01:20:19,791 --> 01:20:21,291
The clock is ticking.

336
01:20:21,375 --> 01:20:25,125
We have to kill them before
the pills' effects wear off.

337
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:27,250
[MIKAELA]
Are you done talking yet?

338
01:20:27,333 --> 01:20:28,541
I want to get this over with.

339
01:20:28,625 --> 01:20:31,500
[GUREN] Heh. Well aren't
you a polite vampire?

340
01:20:31,583 --> 01:20:34,333
Would you let us have a
little more time to regroup?

341
01:20:34,416 --> 01:20:35,458
[MIKAELA]
How much more?

342
01:20:35,541 --> 01:20:37,333
It's time for us to
take our medicine,

343
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:40,291
so if you could be quiet for
just 20 seconds or so we'd--

344
01:20:40,375 --> 01:20:41,708
[GUREN grunts]

345
01:20:43,833 --> 01:20:46,416
Well, you can't blame
a guy for tryin'.

346
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:50,375
And is it just me, or are you
a lot faster than before?

347
01:20:50,458 --> 01:20:53,916
I'm not holding anything
back from now on.

348
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,416
[GUREN grunts]
Holding back on the battlefield?

349
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,750
Sounds like the
strategy of a child.

350
01:20:59,833 --> 01:21:02,208
You shouldn't taunt someone
stronger than you.

351
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:03,500
It's not smart.

352
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:04,916
[GUREN, MIKAELA grunt]

353
01:21:09,916 --> 01:21:11,666
Damn you.

354
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:13,500
[GUREN]
I guess this is it.

355
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:18,333
Uh-- Oh.

356
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:20,625
Looks like his
backup has arrived.

357
01:21:20,708 --> 01:21:22,083
Go on, Mika.

358
01:21:22,166 --> 01:21:24,750
Put the poor man
out of his misery.

359
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:29,791
[gasps]

360
01:21:31,041 --> 01:21:33,416
Not good! He's been cornered!

361
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,750
Quick, everyone,
take your pill!

362
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:38,458
We'll save the Lieutenant
Colonel and then retreat!

363
01:21:40,166 --> 01:21:40,958
Let's do this!

364
01:21:41,041 --> 01:21:42,125
Yeah!

365
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:47,208
This is the end, human.

366
01:21:47,291 --> 01:21:48,666
Do it then.

367
01:21:51,541 --> 01:21:53,000
Guren!

368
01:21:56,208 --> 01:21:57,541
[gasps]

369
01:22:02,625 --> 01:22:04,166
You damn vampire!

370
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:06,875
You get away from him right now.

371
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:11,875
[MIKAELA]
Another reckless human.

372
01:22:11,958 --> 01:22:14,333
What annoying pests.

373
01:22:15,833 --> 01:22:16,833
No way...

374
01:22:16,916 --> 01:22:18,375
Is... that...?

375
01:22:25,125 --> 01:22:26,625
[gasps]

376
01:22:27,833 --> 01:22:29,375
[MIKAELA]
Yu?

377
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:11,541
[YUICHIRO]
Next time, on Seraph of the End.

378
01:24:11,625 --> 01:24:13,791
"Reunion of Childhood Friends."
