00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,750
[YUICHIRO]
Every time I close my eyes.

2
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:38,000
I see the same scene play out.

3
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,791
[MIKAELA] Jeez, would you
quit walking so fast?

4
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,916
Wait up! I'm family!
Don't abandon me, Yu!

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,375
[YUICHIRO] I don't have
a family. Leave me alone.

6
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,750
[MIKAELA giggles]
Sorry, no can do!

7
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,958
The director said everyone
from the Hyakuya Orphanage

8
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,083
is family, so shut up
and deal with it.

9
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,416
[YUICHIRO]
Get off'a me!

10
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,291
[KOUTA]
We are a family, aren't we?

11
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,208
[AKO]
Duh! Of course we are, silly!

12
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:02,791
[AKANE] One big happy family.
Isn't that right, Yu?

13
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:06,500
[YUICHIRO] Honestly, you guys
are a pain in the butt.

14
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:09,916
[KIDS laughing]

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,208
[YUICHIRO] I see the smiling
faces of my dearest friends.

16
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:16,708
My family. And then...

17
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,250
[YUICHIRO gasps]

18
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,250
[YUICHIRO] I see their
bloody, lifeless bodies

19
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,166
lying in front of me.

20
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:28,208
[panting]

21
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,500
Yu, leave us! Get out of here!

22
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:41,250
[MIKAELA whimpering]

23
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:47,166
Forget about us! Just go! Hurry.

24
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:52,875
Mika!

25
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:01,666
[YUICHIRO] It never fails.
Even after four years.

26
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,583
I'm still haunted by my painful
memories of that night.

27
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,875
[rumbling]

28
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,375
[GUARD 2A] It's the
"Four Horsemen of John!"

29
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,083
What the hell are
you doing here?

30
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,375
Get out of the combat zone,
Private Hyakuya!

31
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:31,916
That's an order!

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,041
[YUICHIRO] Who, me? Run away?
Don't count on it.

33
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,750
The only reason I'm here
is to get revenge

34
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,875
on those bloodsucking freaks.

35
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,708
If I can't handle a
small fry like this one,

36
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,416
then I don't deserve
to take another breath!

37
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,541
Private! Stop!

38
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,583
[TEACHER 2A]
He wasn't using...

39
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,625
[YUICHIRO]
This is a load of crap.

40
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,625
I kill a monster and get
slapped with a suspension?

41
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,041
They should be promoting me,

42
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:53,541
not making me rot
in this civilian dump!

43
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,166
I'm a soldier, dammit!

44
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,666
[TEACHER clears throat]
Hey!

45
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,958
What're you mumbling
about over there?

46
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,750
Do you have something
you'd like to add?

47
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,416
If so, then let's hear it.

48
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,083
[YUICHIRO sighs]
Hmph.

49
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,541
[TEACHER] Oh! You better
shape up, Hyakuya!

50
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,208
Don't give me any more trouble!

51
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,458
I'll have you suspended!

52
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,708
What? You'd really
kick me outta here?

53
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,000
Awesome!

54
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,708
Well then, I humbly
request suspension.

55
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,625
How dare you?! Enough!

56
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:20,250
I won't have you mocking me
in front of the class!

57
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,833
Sit down and pay attention!

58
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,666
[YUICHIRO]
What? You got somethin' to say?

59
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,875
[YUICHIRO] "If you continue
to behave uncooperatively,

60
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,291
I will have no choice but to
report you to the army

61
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,125
and extend your suspension".

62
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,666
What?! You gotta be kiddin' me!

63
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,166
That's it!

One more outburst and I'm
sending you straight to the--

Ugh! This sucks!

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,708
Let me finish!

67
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,041
Start cooperating.

68
00:05:56,125 --> 00:06:00,041
--[YUICHIRO] Uh...
--[TEACHER panting]

69
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,541
[TEACHER 2A]
Now, where were we? Ah, yes!

70
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,166
[SHINOA] I should also
point out that your suspension

71
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,208
will remain in effect until
you successfully make a friend.

72
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,166
[YUICHIRO]
Uh--?

73
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,583
You heard right.

74
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,666
So play nice and
be a good student.

75
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,333
[YUICHIRO sighs]

76
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:24,000
[YUICHIRO panting]

77
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,041
But how can you be a human?

78
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,833
Everyone on the surface died!

79
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,791
That what the vamps told you?

80
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,666
I guess I would've done
the same in their shoes.

81
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,958
[GUREN] Heh. Well, it's true
that the virus reduced

82
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,583
the world's population
by about 90%.

83
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,291
And, thanks to the
Trumpets of the Apocalypse,

84
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,000
an army of bizarre
looking monsters

85
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,416
are now roaming the Earth.

86
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,750
But it'll take more than
that to wipe out mankind.

87
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,916
Our resurrection is underway.

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,208
[YUICHIRO]
Resurrection?

89
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,458
Yep, and that's not all.

90
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:59,333
We have plans to make sure our
organization ends up on top.

91
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,666
We're going to
take back the Earth

92
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,333
and gather humanity's
remnants under one banner.

93
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:06,666
No way. So who are you guys?

94
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,791
Lieutenant Colonel Ichinose.

95
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:15,000
Call me Guren. I'm with
the Imperial Demon Army.

96
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,916
Kid, how would you
like to come with us

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,500
and get back at
those bloodsuckers?

98
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,333
Put this on him.

99
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:31,500
Tell me. Do you wanna
get back at the vampires?

[panting]

101
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,750
I do.

102
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,541
If you want your revenge,
take my hand.

103
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,750
I'll give you all
the power you need.

104
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,583
More like "take my hand
and I'll ignore you."

105
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:49,958
You promised me power, Guren,

106
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:53,291
not a four-year
waste of my time.

I'm skipping practice.

I could really go for
a cone right now."

112
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,125
You just missed a
golden opportunity

113
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,666
to make some new friends.

114
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,416
[YUICHIRO] Are you tryin'
to boss me around?

115
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,416
That's not a good idea.

116
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,791
There's that famous attitude
I've heard about.

117
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,875
According to Lieutenant
Colonel Guren,

118
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,708
you avoid social interaction
'cause you lost your family.

119
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,583
You're too afraid to
engage other people.

120
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,750
[YUICHIRO grunts]

121
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,375
[SHINOA]
You fear making connections,

122
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,416
or letting anyone
get close to you.

123
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,750
Because you're afraid
you may lose them.

124
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,291
It sounds lonely.

125
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,125
Don't you want a girlfriend
or maybe a boy--?

126
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,958
Look. I'm not
afraid of anything,

127
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,708
so quit running your mouth
and get off my back.

128
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,250
I guess you can "engage."

129
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,958
[YUICHIRO] If you won't
shut up, then use your trap

130
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,750
for something useful,
like telling Guren

131
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:46,166
to put me in the
Vampire Extermination Unit!

132
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,666
I'm ready.

133
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,250
Give me the chance to make
the fangs bleed for a change.

134
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,125
Here. He thought
you might say that.

135
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:57,041
So the Lieutenant Colonel
told me to give this to you.

136
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,000
[YUICHIRO] Now that's
what I'm talking about.

137
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,666
I knew he hadn't forgotten me.

can't make a friend

Go out, make one,
then introduce them to me.

Of course, I'm not
gonna hold my breath.

[VAMPIRE 2B, YOICHI grunt]

319
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,208
Are you okay?

320
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,375
Yoichi!

321
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,916
[VAMPIRE 2B]
You little...!

322

[growls]

326
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,083
Yoichi. Good job!
That was impressive!

327
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,583
Wow. Thank you.

328
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,458
But, that's what friends
are for, right?

329
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,458
[gasps]

330
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,708
I've had enough
of you, human!

[yells]

332
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,291
[gasps] Hyakuya!

333
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,583
[YUICHIRO groans]

334
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:08,500
[chuckles] Nice try.

335
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,541
Did you really think
this would kill me?

336
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,250
Give me a break.
I'm stronger than that.

337
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,791
I think I've earned a
little snack for the road.

338
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:20,500
[gasps, groans]

339
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:24,250
I'm sorry. You were saying?

340
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,958
But how? How do you
have a cursed weapon?

341
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:32,125
Tsk, tsk. How the mighty
have fallen. You're pathetic.

342
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,166
[GUREN]
And speaking of pathetic.

343
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,750
What were you thinking?

344
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,291
How'd you plan to kill it with a
normal blade and no enchantment?

345
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:47,666
Or were you hoping I'd come
to save your sorry ass?

346
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,458
Whatever! I had it.

347
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,791
I was about to make my move.

348
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:52,875
Right.

349
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,041
[YUICHIRO]
It's true!

350
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,416
Uh-huh.

351
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,291
[GUREN]
Then again.

352
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,125
I have to admit you did
pretty well, for a kid.

353
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,916
Thanks to you, the overall
damage was minimal.

354
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:10,250
On top of that, you saved
all your friends at school.

355
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:14,583
[YUICHIRO] Holy crap!
That's the Moon Demon Company!

356
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:15,916
Yeah, yeah.

357
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,750
I'm not interested
in making friends!

358
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,208
Tch. Hey! Now you've
seen what I can do!

359
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,458
I can kill vampires
with the best of 'em!

360
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,833
So make me a part of
the company, already!

361
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,958
Sorry, but I make
it a strict policy

362
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,500
not to work with lone wolves.

363
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,125
--[SHINOA giggles]
--[GUREN] Hm?

364
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,291
[SHINOA]
That's pretty funny coming from

365
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,875
the biggest lone wolf
in the Demon Army.

366
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,000
Huh? Did you say something?

367
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,375
No, sir.

368
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,791
Anyway, the rules Shinoa
gave you remain the same.

369
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,375
If you can't make a
friend at this school,

370
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,833
then I won't have you joining--

371
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,208
What is it with you trying
to force me to make friends?

372
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,791
It's not like it's gonna help
you kill more vampires!

373
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:54,916
[YOICHI]
Oh, thank goodness!

374
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,500
Huh?

375
00:19:56,583 --> 00:20:00,625
Hyakuya! You're alive!
I thought you'd died!

376
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,291
[YOICHI yelping]

377
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,083
[YUICHIRO, YOICHI grunt]

378
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,750
Who's that?

379
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,041
[SHINOA]
His friend, apparently or lover.

380
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:16,583
Uh? Hyakuya? What's wrong?

381
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,958
Somebody call an ambulance!

382
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,375
Now that he's met
your requirements,

383
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,708
you have to keep up your
end of the bargain,

384
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,250
Lieutenant Colonel.

385
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:28,208
[gasps] What?
Are you kidding me?

386
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,458
[YUICHIRO]
Every time I close my eyes,

387
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,041
I see the same scene play out.

388
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:36,416
I see the smiling faces
of my dearest friends.

389
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,875
My family. And then...

390
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,916
[MIKAELA] Whew, you had
us worried there, Yu.

391
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,583
But I'm glad you
made a new friend.

392
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,458
[YUICHIRO]
But, how are you guys still--?

393
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,000
Now we can stop
worrying about you.

394
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,250
Don't you get it?

395
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,541
We don't want you
to live for revenge.

396
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,666
You're way too nice
to go through that.

397
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,125
Listen.

398
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,291
You need to take good care
of your new friend, okay?

399
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,791
Well, we've gotta get going.

400
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:09,666
[YUICHIRO gasps] Uh--! Hey!
What do you mean you're going?

401
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,500
Mika, please don't leave me!

402
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,250
Wait! Come back! Mika!

403
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:19,791
[gasps]

404
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:23,000
[YOICHI gasps]
Hyakuya! Thank goodness.

405
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:26,375
Look, Shinoa! He finally
managed to wake up!

406
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,833
[gasps] It's about time.

407
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,166
[SHINOA]
I have good news.

408
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,916
As of today, you're
officially assigned

409
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,166
to the Vampire
Extermination Unit.

410
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,250
[YUICHIRO]
Huh?

411
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,208
[YOICHI]
Congrats, Yu! That's awesome!

412
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,500
[SHINOA]
I almost forgot!

413
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,833
Your enlistment
was also accepted.

414
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,791
Welcome to the army, Yoichi.

415
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,041
The two of you made quite an
impression on your comrades.

416
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:56,125
You put your lives on the line,
and fought bravely,

417
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,333
for people you don't even know.

418
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,583
Gentlemen, welcome to
Moon Demon Company.

419
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,958
[YOICHI]
Hm.

420
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,750
From now on, you're one of us.

421
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,583
[YOICHI]
C'mon. Bring it in, buddy!

422
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:14,291
[YUICHIRO sighs]
This is so stupid.

423
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,541
[YUICHIRO]
Fine.

424
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,666
Happy?

425
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,583
[YUICHIRO]
Next time, on Seraph of the End.

426
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,500
"The Demon in Your Heart."
