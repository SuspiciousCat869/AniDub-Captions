1
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,833
Today, we've gathered all nobles
with the progenitor's blood

2
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,708
to address a growing concern.

3
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,333
Humans!

4
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,666
The Japanese Imperial Demon Army
has been ramping up operations

5
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,958
and increasing their
numbers in Northern Tokyo.

6
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,625
This human organization is
killing our brothers...

7
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,375
[MIKAELA]
"Human organization"?

8
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,916
[HOST] ...and flirting
with forbidden enchantments

9
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,416
to increase their power.

10
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,583
According to our intel,
they are once again

11
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,416
experimenting on
the Seraph of the End.

12
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,750
[KRUL]
Hm.

13
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:37,875
If we allow these humans

14
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,625
to continue to rise
and gain strength,

15
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,000
another plague like the one
that occurred eight years ago

16
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,000
will surely come to pass.

17
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,375
[KRUL]
You needn't worry about that.

18
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:53,208
Because we're exterminating the
Japanese Imperial Demon Army.

19
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,500
We're going to war!

20
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,583
[CROWD gasps]

21
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,083
To ensure that we continue
to rule this world,

22
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,500
we'll have to slaughter the
greedy livestock resistance

23
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,791
once and for all!

24

[CROWD cheers]

25
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,458
[MIKAELA]
Extermination.

26
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,750
The Seraph of the End.

27
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:15,791
Don't worry, Yu. I'm coming
to your rescue soon.

[GUREN snores]

29
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,750
[OFFICER] That's all I have
to report from Block Three, sir.

[rustling, clattering]

31
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:30,500
[SHINYA] I'm Imperial Demon Army
Major General, Shinya Hiragi.

32
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,166
I'll be covering reports
from the Kansai region.

33
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,333
Several of them concern
suspicious vampire activity,

34
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,291
among other things.

[GUREN snores]

Hey! Quit sawin' logs!

38
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,166
Uh...? Huh? Ahh...

39
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:52,083
Are we finally done with
this boring ass meeting?

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,208
[TENRI]
Drop the attitude, Guren.

41
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,458
You're not as special
as you might think.

42
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,875
[GUREN]
Sorry, General.

43
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,416
It's just so hard to remember
that when I'm surrounded

44
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,958
by the dullest
personalities in the army.

45
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,375
Is that so?

46
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,500
Well, I can beat the lesson--

47
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:08,833
Pardon, sir.

48
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,500
Ichinose's attitude is
nothing new to this room.

49
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,875
Now, as I was saying.

50
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:14,750
[chair clatters]

51
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,916
[GUREN]
I'm takin' off.

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,166
You can send me all
of the information later.

53
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,541
Come on, Guren. I can't
defend you forever.

54
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,708
You're gonna have to adjust
your attitude sooner or later.

55
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:29,500
Ha!

56
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,583
I never ask you to defend me.

57
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,791
[SHINYA sighs]

58
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,291
You Hiragis control
the Imperial Demon Army.

59
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,208
You don't need a second-class
Ichinose hangin' around.

60
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:41,583
So, I'm out. I've got
some sleep to catch up on.

61
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:45,875
[SEISHIRO] Tch. At least you
know your place, dead weight.

62
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:49,625
We'll handle things like we
always have. Without you.

63
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:53,541
It's a wonder humanity's
still kicking. Later.

64
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,041
Ugh... Feels like I
lost a few brain-cells.

65
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,833
[YUICHIRO] You can't hide
from me today, Guren!

66
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,041
[YUICHIRO yells]

67
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,416
[GUREN grunts, chuckles]

68
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,458
[YUICHIRO grunts]

69
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,500
[GUREN] There's no beating
around the bush with you.

70
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,750
[YUICHIRO yelps]

71
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:23,666
[grunts]

72
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,958
[GUREN]
It's kinda refreshing

73
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,583
after dealing with
pointless politics all day.

74
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,000
You know what I'm after!

75
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,333
Now, quit wasting my time
and give me a Cursed Gear!

76
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,333
I can handle the demon.

77
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,916
Oh, yeah? This have
anything to do

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,791
with getting vengeance
for your family?

79
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,708
Of course! It's the only
thing I've lived for

80
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,583
ever since you brought me here!

81
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:44,041
We need to get you a date. Soon.

82
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,833
[GUREN] I better pacify this
idiot before he makes a scene.

83
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,833
Last thing I need is him
getting the Hiragis' attention.

84
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:56,875
[GUREN] Fine. Let's go make
a contract with a demon.

85
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,375
Then, you'll join us
on the front line.

86
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,125
Huh? No joke?

87
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,500
[GUREN]
Sure, why not?

88
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,583
I don't care if you haven't
finished your training.

89
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,083
That way, it's your
fault if you die.

90
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,333
[laughs]

91
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,916
Like we need to worry
about that happening.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm a badass! I'll be slaying
monsters from dusk till dawn!

93
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:15,958
[chuckles]

94
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,916
You really are an idiot, huh?

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Oh, and there's one
more thing, Yu.

96
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:21,750
[YUICHIRO]
Huh?

97
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:22,958
[YUICHIRO grunts]

98
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:27,083
That's for trying to
kick a superior officer!

99
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,333
[YUICHIRO groans]

100
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,166
[GUREN sighs]
The burdens of command

101
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,208
can really take it out of ya.

102
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,000
But, I've gotta admit,

103
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:40,666
things are getting a lot less
boring around here. Heh.

104
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,833
[SHINOA]
What happened to your head?

105
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:55,166
Let me guess, you skipped class
and got into another fight?

106
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,666
What's it to you?

107
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,416
You should know Guren doesn't
pull any punches, by now.

108
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,083
Umm. Why'd you ask if you knew?

109
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:05,583
It's fun. Congrats, by the way.

110
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:06,500
[YUICHIRO]
Hm?

111
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,375
[SHINOA]
On the demon contract.

112
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,708
He finally approved
it, didn't he?

113
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,291
Yeah. But you know him.

114
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,791
He makes choices on a whim
and doesn't follow through.

115
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,125
You can't fool me.

116
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,833
I can tell you're nearly
bursting at the seams.

No, I'm not!

Don't worry about it.

[YUICHIRO]
Hm?

120
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,541
[SHINOA] Lieutenant
Colonel Guren may have

121
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:30,000
a razor-sharp tongue and a
general fondness for brutality,

122
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,708
but he always
keeps his promises.

123

Finally. It's happening.

to kill those parasites.

see your precious angel again.

for you, Mika.

I've already finished
grading your written exams,

so I'll just be handing those
out and calling it a day, okay?

Remember, this score is crucial

140

to your overall
Cursed Gear ranking.

141
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,291
The way you perform in class

142
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,041
is just as important
as in training.

143
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,291
I expect those of you with
less than passing grades

144

to put extra effort into
your studies from now on.

look at this score?

How'd he get zero points?

162
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,708
That takes a special
kind of dumb.

163
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,333
Whoa. That's Crazy!

[YUICHIRO]
What's your problem?

169
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,541
Can't you find someone
else to annoy?

170
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,166
Now, is that any way
to talk to a lady?

171
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,791
Especially one who's
trying to help you fit in.

172
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,000
You could try to show
some gratitude.

173
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,958
You can take your gratitude
and choke on it!

174
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,625
I'll tell you what I
keep telling Guren,

175
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,791
I don't need friends to
stick it to the bloodsuckers!

176
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:07,833
Are we clear?

177
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,333
Yeah, we're as clear as crystal.

178
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,125
Just don't come crying
to me when you realize

179
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,541
that you're completely
worthless by yourself.

180
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,333
Oh, yeah?

181
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,000
I'll kill 50 of those fangs
with my eyes closed.

[SHINOA]
Said the childish fool.

183
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,333
You're a childish fool.

184
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,083
[YOICHI] Come on, it makes
sense that you failed.

185

[YUICHIRO gasps]

186
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,791
Sorry, that didn't come
out like I meant it to.

187
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,916
I'm just saying that,
since you spent several years

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,583
as a prisoner of the vampires,
your Japanese reading and

189
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,500
writing skills aren't as strong
as your English and Latin are.

190
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,833
So, it makes sense
that you failed.

191
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:41,250
Uh... Well, yeah. But that
goes without saying.

192
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,500
[KIMIZUKI] That excuse is
crappier than your test score.

193
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:44,666
Huh?

194
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,166
[YUICHIRO]
How would you know-- Ah!

195
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,291
[growls]

196
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,208
Then what's your score?
It better be epic,

197
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,958
or I'll pop you one for
being an arrogant ass.

198
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:58,291
Come on, Four Eyes, let's see
how smart you really are.

199
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,916
See for yourself.

200
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,833
Latin, English, and Japanese
spell-craft. Easy stuff.

201
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,250
Foreign languages aren't
even my strong suit.

202
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,708
I should be no match
for a seasoned

you from class yet.

stupid mouth one more time!

world a favor and...

Hey! I can hear you morons
half-way down the hall!

What else is new?

219
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,083
Anyway, is there a reason
for all the racket?

220
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,583

I should've known.

224
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,500
Wait. Let's put this
on hold for now.

225
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,708
Guren's come out of hiding.

226
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,291
What's the deal?

227
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,666
I thought you said I was gonna
get to contract with a Demon!

228
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,875
How much longer do I have to--

229
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,666
Let me do the talking.
You're way too loud.

230
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,708
With all due respect. I think
you owe us an explanation.

231
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,083
You have an obligation
to this class, but you left

232
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,708
for over ten days without
any regard for your students.

233
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:27,583
I think giving us some Cursed
Gear would make up for that.

234
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:28,916
Really?

235
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,916
You think a bunch of
dumbass losers like you

have what it takes to
tangle with a demon, huh?

--[YUICHIRO] No doubt about it!
--Uh?

238

The only dumbass in here
is Kimizuki. I won't fail!

239
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,500
Your test score says otherwise.

240
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,416

[YUICHIRO, KIMIZUKI groan]

243
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,916
[GUREN]
So. What's your assessment?

244
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,458
Can this class resist
the demon's temptation?

245
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,875
Hmm... Well, there's always
room for improvement.

246
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,625
But those two are much
stronger than I was at 16.

247
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,541
I think they could do it.

248
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,250
[GUREN]
What about the others?

249
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,000
There are a few contenders.

250
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,125
But, Yoichi Saotome
takes the cake.

251
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,666
He has a surprisingly high
stability against demons.

252
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,750
Really? Okay then.

253
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,291
Why don't we give it a shot now?

254
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,916
It's less complicated that way.

255
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,125
No! You can't do that
in the classroom!

256
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,666
Oh, my! Are you
planning to attack?

257
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,916
This sure got interesting fast.

Hope you're ready, kids!

If you die from this,

[STUDENTS groaning]

273
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,041
[GUREN]
All right. Good.

274
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,291
If you're still conscious,
you've got a chance.

275

Make no mistake, you've
got a long way to go.

276

But, if you continue to train
and study your spell-craft,

277
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:43,250
you could move into the Contract
Ceremony for a Cursed Gear.

still on your feet.

yourself four stars.

You'll get to try out for a
Black Demon Series Cursed Gear;

weapon as my sword.

there's only three.

Ha!

Dealing with demons

289
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,833
is like a day at the
beach for you, isn't it?

290

Guess I should expect as much
from General Hiragi's daughter.

You probably didn't even
use a ward. What a turn-off.

So, uh...

297
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,750
Lieutenant Colonel Guren,
I know I should expect

298
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,375
unconventional tests
and tactics from you,

299
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,875
but I'm not entirely sure
letting Yoichi try out

300
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,666
for the Black Demon
Series is a good idea.

301
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,458
[GUREN] Do you have a
problem with my decision?

302
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,208
No, sir, that's not what
I'm saying. It's just...

303
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,750
I'm not certain he has enough
strength to accept a demon in--

304
00:16:56,833 --> 00:17:00,416
[GUREN] Tough. If he doesn't
have the strength, he dies.

305
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,458
That's the world we live in.
We're not playing games here.

00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,375
But, sir...

308
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:16,208
For crying out loud.
Yoichi, tell me.

309
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,083
You still want to avenge
your sister's death

310
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,833
at the hands of the
vampires, don't you?

[gasps]

312
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,333
Yes, of course.

313
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,583
All right. Are you
willing to die for it?

314
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:27,875
[grunts]

315
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,375
I dunno.

316
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,250
Then you should quit right now.

317
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,916
If you have any doubts,
go back up those stairs.

318
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,916
[gasps]

319
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,500
--[YUICHIRO] Go, Yoichi.
--[YOICHI gasps]

320
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,041
This isn't the kind of place
a nice guy like you should be,

321
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,375
and you know it.

322
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,083
--I agree, Saotome.
--[YOICHI gasps]

323
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,708
Leave while you can.

324
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:51,958
[gasps]

325
00:17:56,625 --> 00:18:00,416
[YOICHI] No matter how hard I
cover my ears, I still hear it.

326
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:05,250
[YOICHI] I'm still under
that bed, frightened.

327
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,541
Did you not hear what
I said? Get outta here!

328
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:13,000
[YOICHI] I've made up
my mind. I'm doing it.

329
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,750
This is the only way I'll
get the strength I need.

330
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,958
I have to make sure that
nothing in this world

331
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,375
can take away the people
I hold dear ever again!

332
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:26,666
[YUICHIRO] Damn. In the end,
he's no different than I am.

333
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,041
[GUREN]
Hm.

334
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,541
All right. Let's
keep movin', people.

335
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,083
[GUREN]
Time for the ceremony.

336
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,083
[YOICHI grunts]

337
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,041
[YUICHIRO]
Hey!

338
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,208
Huh?

339
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,583
Getting cold feet now
isn't gonna help.

340
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:10,833
[YOICHI]
Uh...

341
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,125
[KIMIZUKI] There's no
point worrying about it.

342
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,375
[BOTH gasp]

343
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,958
Deal with it. You've
made your choice.

344
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,541
[SHINOA]
Are you sure you'll be able

345
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,708
to "deal with it," Kimizuki?

346
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,625
You were standing at first.

347
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,416
Then you leaned over. Was the
demon too much to handle?

348
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,833
[KIMIZUKI grunts]

349
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,083
[SHINOA]
You saw it too, right, Yoichi?

350
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:32,083
Me? Well... Yeah.

351
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,291
Ah.

352
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,000
Stop paying attention
to the small things!

353
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,458
[YUICHIRO] They weren't the
only ones who saw it, Kimizuki.

354
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,708
[KIMIZUKI grunts]

355
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,291
In fact, I remember you
being in a lot of agony.

356
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,625
The last thing you
should be doing

357
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,083
is getting too comfortable, Yu.

358
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,666
The demon you'll make
a contract with

359
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,625
is much stronger
than the last one.

360
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,791
If you let your guard down
for an instant, it'll kill you.

361
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,166
Yeah, I already know.

362
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,750
[YUICHIRO, YOICHI,
KIMIZUKI gasp]

363
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,958
Welcome to the edge of hell.

364
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,333
What is this? A temple?

365
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,875
It's the home of the thing
you want most of all.

366
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,208
The highest-ranking weapons

367
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:33,166
with Demon Kings sealed
inside them are kept here.

368
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,208
The "highest-ranking," huh?

369
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,166
So. If I have one of these,
I can kill the vampires?

370
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,958
[GUREN] That depends
on your personal skill.

371
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:49,708
Okay. But they're all the
same as your sword, right?

372
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,041
[GUREN]
Yes.

373
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,208
The rare Black Demon Series.

374
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,416
Quit asking questions.
Let's get started.

375
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,875
I've got more
important things to do

376
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:02,541
than hang out in a dark cellar
with a group of newbies.

377
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,291
Fine. What do I have to do?

378
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,500
[GUREN] Pick a weapon you like
and enter the spell circle.

379
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:09,833
Once you touch the weapon,

380
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:13,250
the Contract Ceremony
will begin automatically.

381
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:17,291
If you don't lose to the demon,
you'll gain its power.

382
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,208
[KIMIZUKI]
And what if we do lose?

383
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,250
[GUREN] You'll either become
a man-eating monster,

384
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,750
or the demon's power will
crush your soul and kill you.

385
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:25,958
[chuckles]

386
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,583
Either way, you'll end up dead.

387
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,958
If you start to go monster
on us, I'll kill you myself.

388
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,333
[gasps]

389
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,291
[YUICHIRO chuckles]

390
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,666
[YUICHIRO]
Fine by me.

391
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,875
I've been waiting a long time
for a chance like this.

392
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,416
Besides, I'd rather
fight with a demon

393
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,500
than sit through
another boring lecture.

394
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,916
The vampires will suffer.

395
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,750
For Mika and my family,

396
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,458
I'll exterminate every
last one of them.

397
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,833
[YUICHIRO] That's the only
thing I still live for!

398
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,625
Then draw, and it'll begin.

399
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:15,541
All right, you bastard,
let's dance! Give me your power!

400
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,125
[YUICHIRO]
Next time, on Seraph of the End:

401
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:08,916
"New Family."
