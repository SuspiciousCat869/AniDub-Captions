WEBVTT

00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:13.597
That tasted amazing!

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.058
I can't believe
they paired so well.

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.601
Yeah, but we're
not gonna be able

00:00:17.643 --> 00:00:20.521
to taste this again unless
we come back someday.

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:23.023
We cleaned out
the whole jar out.

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:25.901
Too bad, but tasty as
that anchovy soup was,

00:00:25.943 --> 00:00:27.986
there's one dish
that's even better.

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:30.572
Yeah? Well, what is it?

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:33.450
Wild greens picked
by Queen Iris herself.

00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:34.785
Huh?

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:37.955
He's right.
They're rather delicious.

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:40.666
Wild greens picked by the queen?

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:50.050
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
I've had wild greens before.

00:00:50.092 --> 00:00:52.302
That said, considering
how your land

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:54.388
is constantly
bathed in light,

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.100
I imagine the greens that
grow here taste much better.

00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.601
Let's get some.

00:00:59.643 --> 00:01:01.270
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:04.940
Let's all go out and
pick greens together.

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:22.332
[IRIS humming, giggling]

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:23.417
[SHEAMA]
What's your hurry?

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:26.086
It's not like these plants
are going anywhere.

00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:29.131
[IRIS] Trust me. The earlier
we get there, the better.

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:31.341
Are you as excited as you look?

00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:33.635
Yes. Of cou‐‐

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:35.429
[PHIOUS]
Queen Iris!

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:41.476
Don't worry. I just tripped
a little bit, that's all.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:43.353
Well, please be careful.

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:46.231
You shouldn't push yourself
until you're fully recovered.

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:47.691
[GROUP grunts]

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:50.068
Right. [laughs]

00:01:56.325 --> 00:01:59.286
Hurry up! We're burning
daylight, guys!

00:01:59.328 --> 00:02:00.996
[ALL laugh]

00:02:01.997 --> 00:02:04.499
Uh. Hey, Commander.

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:06.501
If ya brought that thing
to cut down greens with,

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:08.378
it seems like overkill.

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:11.506
[PHIOUS]
Who knows what's lurking

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:13.258
in the dark of the woods.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.428
Uh? Always the vigilant soldier.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.639
They'll never catch
you off‐guard.

00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:00.365
[IRIS]
This way, everyone!

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.544
So tall.

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:15.255
‐‐Yeah, it's really something.
‐‐Whoa...

00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:17.632
Is this where you always
go to pick greens?

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:21.511
Yes. Edible plants grow all
over this patch of forest.

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:23.263
I see.

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:27.559
Okay, shall we get started?

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:30.645
Sure, but why don't we
spice this up a little?

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.898
What do you mean?

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.983
[ADEL] Picking plants
won't be that fun by itself,

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:37.944
so let's split into pairs and
see who can pick the most.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:39.446
Cool idea!

00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:41.531
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:46.161
[PHIOUS] This herb is called
iris. It means "bringer of joy."

00:04:46.203 --> 00:04:50.040
[GROZA] Aren't these cute,
Your Highness? [laughs]

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:51.917
You're on!

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.335
Let's do it!

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:54.461
Are you in?

00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:56.546
Sure, if everyone else is.

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:59.049
Okay. How should we split up?

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.425
[ADEL]
Hm. Good question.

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:02.385
[PHIOUS grunts]

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:03.929
Oh. I know.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.514
To promote closer ties and all,

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:08.850
each pair should have
someone from each kingdom.

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:12.020
[gasps] Yes, I agree.
Closer ties.

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:14.231
That does seem like
the best option.

00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:15.982
Excellent thinking.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.819
[ADEL]
You seem disappointed.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.238
[PHIOUS clears throat]
That's fine in theory,

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.573
but as the Queen's security,
I should really‐‐

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:26.117
[IRIS]
Wait. Before we get to that.

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:30.080
There are things
you should know.

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.999
Foraging for food
can be dangerous.

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:35.335
Some greens are
poisonous if eaten raw.

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:37.838
And some have to be
picked in a certain way.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.298
What's a good example?

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:45.011
[IRIS]
These angelica shoots'll do.

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:46.721
These guys? Huh.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:49.933
You're saying that we can eat
these thorny little trees?

00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:50.976
[IRIS]
That's right.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:55.355
These trees grow edible
shoots up on their tips.

00:05:55.397 --> 00:06:00.151
Grab them with a stick
like so, and snap them off.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:03.196
[THEO] Cool! You've brought us
those before, haven't you?

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:04.865
Yes. That said...

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.826
The shoots get rather bitter
once they reach a certain size,

00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:10.120
so try not to pick any
bigger than this.

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.247
That make sense?

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:15.584
They've always been bitter.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.669
[IRIS] Also, if you pick all
the shoots off a trunk,

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:18.879
the tree will die.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.465
So it's important we leave
a little green on each one.

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:25.010
Oh! Those are Fuki Buds!

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:26.511
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:29.264
[IRIS]
Down there, look.

00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:32.934
To pull these up, you just
twist them from their roots.

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:34.269
Just like this.

00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:35.770
Whoa...

00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:38.773
Around here, there are
flowering ferns,

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:40.859
bracken, fiddleheads, chives...

00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:42.736
There's really more
than I can list.

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:43.862
Here's an idea.

00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:46.114
If you run across a plant
you aren't sure about,

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:48.074
call for me and I'll help.

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:49.910
[SHEAMA] I don't think you
should compete, then.

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:51.745
You can just help everyone.

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:52.621
Agreed.

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:53.955
What?!

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:55.332
[GROZA laughs]

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.376
[ADEL]
Okay, we've got our pairs.

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:00.587
We've got this!

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:05.842
[GROZA gasping]

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:08.929
[gasps] Well, let's do our best!

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.764
Yes. Good luck.

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:12.641
[IRIS laughs]

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:17.938
'Kay, Sheama. Let's go.

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.565
That's still Lady Sheama
to you, all right?

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:24.069
But we're pairing up like this
to foster closer relations.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.029
Right?

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:32.786
Between our countries,
Envoy Adel. Be pro‐fesh‐io‐nal.

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:36.748
Fine. We can keep it formal.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.794
[IRIS grunts] Now that we have
our teams, let's start!

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:50.303
[SHEAMA grunts]
Look.

00:07:50.345 --> 00:07:52.681
[ADEL]
Good find. What're these, again?

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:56.810
[SHEAMA] I believe I heard Queen
Iris call them Fuki Buds, but...

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:58.687
...these ones have bloomed
a lot more than

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:00.313
the ones she picked,
so I'm not sure

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:01.606
if they'll be good to eat.

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:04.234
I doubt it makes
much of a difference.

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:06.194
Let's pick these things
and move along.

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:08.321
[SHEAMA]
No, don't!

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:09.698
What's with you?

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:12.575
The Queen said to check
with her if we weren't sure.

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:15.912
Uh. Well, aren't you earnest?

00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:17.872
I feel like this boils
down to a difference

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:19.791
between our cultures.

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:24.379
[SHEAMA] I wouldn't look
that far into it.

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:27.757
You and I just have
different personalities.

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:30.468
[ADEL laughs]
That's for sure.

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:37.058
Forgive me for being short
with you. Here. Take it.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:42.022
'Kay. Don't you wanna
talk to the Queen first?

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:44.149
They aren't that different
from the ones she picked.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.276
It shouldn't be an issue.

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:51.031
Hey, look here!

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:52.115
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Hm?

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:55.285
[THEO] These plants
look like birds' feet!

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:57.454
I wonder if they're
tasty or not.

00:08:57.495 --> 00:09:00.707
I couldn't say.
We'll have to ask.

00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:03.001
Oh! Your Majesty!

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:05.045
[gasps, giggles]

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.214
What have you found?

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:10.216
I'm not quite sure. Take a look!

00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:14.387
Oh. This plant is called
bird's foot astilbe.

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:16.765
Awesome, I totally guessed it!

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:18.391
Are these edible?

00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:22.645
Yes. Bird's foot tastes
quite good if you boil it.

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:24.689
Let's start picking, then.

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.816
[IRIS] Technically,
the whole plant is edible.

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:28.151
Dry its roots in the shade

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:30.278
and you can use them
as a natural remedy.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.114
For the most part, they're
a way of treating colds.

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:35.700
You know a whole lot
about herbs, don't you?

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:40.914
Uh. Well... I know a little.

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:43.541
These aren't too
difficult to harvest.

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.502
Just snap them from
the base of the stem

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:46.961
and you'll be good to go.

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:51.299
Cool! There's more!

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:58.431
Would it be all right
if I accompanied you two?

00:09:58.473 --> 00:09:59.933
Sure.

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:02.310
Okay, great! Thank you.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.526
[BOTH gasp]

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:11.319
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:13.446
[IRIS]
It's all right.

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:19.160
[PHIOUS growling]

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:22.455
Hold on, why is your hand
on the hilt of your sword?

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:24.040
It's for the queen's sake.

00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:27.001
I have to be ready if someone
from Black attacks her.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:31.214
Do you mean one of us?
I thought we were past that.

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:33.383
Yes. We are past that.

00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:36.302
I don't doubt the
intentions of you envoys.

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:40.515
Good. At least we've
come that far, I guess.

00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:42.016
[PHIOUS sighs]

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:47.480
Um. Can I help you?

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:53.153
[PHIOUS] Surprisingly enough,
you seem to trust each other

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:57.407
just as I trust my
comrades here in White.

00:10:57.448 --> 00:11:02.120
I don't trust everyone down
in Black. But I trust him.

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:04.956
I think he has the potential
to be our next king.

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:08.459
If it's your opinion

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:11.421
that a prince should be
selfish and cruel,

00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:14.924
then we can leave the rest
of this debate to our swords.

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:16.426
I've glimpsed an ideal.

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:17.677
[ADEL gasping]

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:22.223
And so, I have a duty
to fight for it now.

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:23.474
[ADEL]
What?

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:25.268
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
I plan to use the throne

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:30.106
to fix this world. I swear,
my people will be happy.

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:35.570
His words rang true to me.
They inspired me.

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:38.948
Ah. I took him for
a rakish scoundrel.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.325
[GROZA]
Hm?

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:43.119
Adel...

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:46.664
Whoa. Slow down. I wasn't
talking about Adel.

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:48.333
Wait, what?

00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:59.302
Did everyone manage to
find a lot of greens?

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:00.345
Sure did!

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:02.722
[GROUP laughs]

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:03.932
[IRIS]
Well done.

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:05.767
You found some
bracken, fiddleheads,

00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:08.853
bird's foot astilbe,
and some plantain lilies!

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:11.648
And you picked them
all so nicely, too.

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:13.233
[laughs]

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:25.495
As for you... Wow! That's
quite a few Fuki Buds.

00:12:25.536 --> 00:12:27.622
It looks like some of them
have already started

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:29.958
to bloom a little bit...

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:33.044
But not enough that they won't
still be perfectly tasty.

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:33.920
[sighs]

00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:35.672
Well, that works out.

00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:36.881
Right?

00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:39.842
Now, what's in here?

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:44.055
Ah. This is koshiabura. But...

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:47.308
I don't see anything else
in here that looks edible.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.060
You should've asked me
to help you.

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:51.437
I could've told you
what to look out for.

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:53.439
Right. Sorry.

00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:57.652
That's that.

00:12:57.694 --> 00:13:00.613
It seems pretty obvious
that we've got you beat.

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:03.366
I'm not so sure.
Let's count them.

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:07.412
Fine, but it's plain to see
that our baskets are fuller.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.334
Yay! We did it!

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:15.003
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS grunts]

00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:16.254
So close.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:19.382
They definitely beat us
in terms of numbers.

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:22.760
It's too bad we aren't
judging this by weight.

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:25.888
Still, we put up a good
fight, don't you think?

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.017
Yeah. We have that at least.

00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:31.728
Now then. Using the greens
all of you picked,

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:35.231
as well as some that I found,
we'll cook ourselves a meal.

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:36.816
All right!

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:51.664
What are you so pleased about?

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:56.502
Queen Iris is going to cook for
us! So why wouldn't I be happy?

00:13:56.544 --> 00:14:00.965
[THEO] Know what? It's eating
together that makes it so good.

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:02.675
[gasps]

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:12.935
Anyway, we should get
our cooking space ready.

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:15.938
Question, Adel. Could you
and the guys find some wood?

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.441
Uh. Sure. Let's get to it.

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:20.526
[THEO, PRINCE OF DARKNESS grunt]

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:22.403
We should fetch
some fresh water.

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:24.405
Sure.

00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:25.865
I know where you can find some.

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:29.702
There's a spring nearby.
I'll take you to it.

00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:41.756
It's so warm. Even a
broken stick like this

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:44.133
still feels like
it's full of life.

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:46.886
Well, yeah. It was
lying in the sun.

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:50.473
I guess that kind of
warmth is rare in Black.

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:56.437
Yeah. The occasional ray
breaks through the clouds,

00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:58.314
but it's rare.

00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:00.983
I never knew that light
could feel so pleasant.

00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:05.947
[laughs] Well, we have plenty,
so feel free to bask in it.

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:22.255
We let them soak in water
to rinse away the bitterness.

00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:23.506
[GROZA]
Ah...

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:28.344
That's just our way. Things
might be different in Black.

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:32.098
[GROZA] Wow, it looks like
you're making tea.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.851
Back in our kingdom, we would
have to soak them overnight.

00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:38.646
The bitterness doesn't
wash out so easily.

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:42.108
Interesting. This must be
a benefit of pure soul.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.277
You have it good up here.

00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:49.532
You two can go ahead
and walk back.

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:51.534
I need to soak these a bit more.

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:54.120
Sounds good.
We'll get things ready.

00:16:03.087 --> 00:16:06.048
Hey, do you think this
is enough firewood?

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:09.218
No, you aren't even
close right now.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.513
We each need at least this much,
or else the fire will die.

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:15.391
[ADEL sighs]

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:19.312
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS grunting]

00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:20.813
Where's Theo?

00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:22.315
He can't be far.

00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:25.067
What? He's right... here.

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:28.821
Actually, I haven't
seen him in a bit.

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:33.659
Damn it. Where the hell
could he have run off to?

00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:35.786
I'll go this way!
You check there.

Hey! Theo! It's me.
Where are you?!

We can't find Theo!

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:54.949
[IRIS gasps] I just saw him.
I believe he went back to camp.

00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:59.954
[IRIS] He was holding
a bunch of firewood.

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:07.795
Groza and Sheama
were both with him.

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:09.005
Thank goodness.

00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:10.339
I was scared.

00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:14.176
Uh! Please forgive me.

00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:24.437

Thank you.

00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:35.531
[IRIS] For showing so much
concern for Theo. I'm grateful.

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:41.329
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
It was nothing.

00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:48.502
We should dry our
clothes and head back.

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:57.053
Hey, Phious! [laughs]

00:18:57.094 --> 00:18:58.679
Ah. You ran back to camp.

00:18:58.721 --> 00:19:01.891
Yup! You said that if I ever
got separated from you,

00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:04.560
that I should just go back
to wherever we started.

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:06.354
I guess I did.

00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:09.315
For real? Here, I was
startin' to panic.

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:18.824

waiting for so long.

It's fine, welcome back.

What were you two
doin' out there?

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.921
It's kind of a long story.

[gasping]

00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:38.135
Well, after all that work,
this had better taste good.

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:40.846
I quite agree. I'd be
happy to assist you

00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:42.348
in preparing our meal.

Huh? Yeah.
You can "assist" me.

Looks like they're
getting along.

Well, who would've guessed.

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:06.914
[PHIOUS] So? What do you
think of our wild greens?

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:10.000
They're at least as good as
that soup we had, right?

00:20:11.085 --> 00:20:14.588
Definitely.
This stuff is awesome!

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:18.384
There's plenty to go around.

So take your time and savor it.

[grunts] And what do you think?

00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:25.808
The flavor isn't
too bitter, is it?

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.519
No. I think it tastes great.

00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:30.187
Compared to what
grows in Black,

00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:32.565
these greens don't
taste bitter at all.

00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:36.527
And also, they smell amazing.

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:39.697

Delicious!

That said... I do wish I could
salt it just a little bit.

You sure about that? To me
it tastes perfect as it is.

00:21:04.221 --> 00:21:07.308
Still, I suppose we
may as well try it out...

00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:08.684
You do have salt!

would do the trick.

Think that settles it.
Our next order of business

00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:33.834
should be to draft out
a trade agreement.

00:21:33.876 --> 00:21:35.795
Yeah? Is that meant as a joke,

00:21:35.836 --> 00:21:38.714
or should I take it back
home as an official offer?

00:21:38.756 --> 00:21:41.217
[gasps] We can't.

00:21:41.258 --> 00:21:43.969

decide these things.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.142
In my opinion, we should
do more than trade.

It's my sincere hope
that in time

we'll get to enjoy each
other's company again.

00:21:56.148 --> 00:21:58.192
