00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:38.830
[IRIS] The prince‐‐
he always puzzled me.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.624
Reserved as he was,

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.585
there was something
about him that struck me.

00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:45.671
A tempered look in his eyes.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:49.216
A calm that could
only come from a storm.

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:53.178
[IRIS]
I found it quite strange.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.304
I could tell at once that

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:57.474
he was the heir to
the King of Darkness.

00:00:57.516 --> 00:00:59.726
But he was kind and shy‐‐

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:02.563
the opposite of what I expected.

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:03.897
I worried that someone like him

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:06.942
might not be able
to inherit the throne.

00:01:06.984 --> 00:01:10.571
And also, I worried that
I would never get the chance

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:13.907
to have a meaningful
conversation with him.

00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:15.867
It's all black.

00:01:24.293 --> 00:01:25.711
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
I swear

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.505
I will help you bring
peace to this world.

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:31.675
You have my word.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.389
[IRIS]
A promise.

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:23.286
[BLUE CAT 09A meows]

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:25.706
[IRIS gasps]

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:28.792
[IRIS grunts]

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.110
[AIDE 01A]
Commander Phious.

00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:55.944
[PHIOUS]
Sir.

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:58.488
I hear the troops of Black
attacked the city, too.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.532
Can you confirm these reports?

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:02.868
[PHIOUS] There weren't
many of them, but yes.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.286
They came to the city.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.204
To Metis as well.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.790
Though I suspect
they were just scouts.

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:11.835
[AIDE 01A]
Hmm. What now, my queen?

00:04:11.877 --> 00:04:13.962
We are beset on all sides.

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:17.215
How should we go about
our kingdom's defense?

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:20.343
Alert the garrisons,
and then increase the watch.

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.429
The moment we
detect an enemy force,

00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:24.806
I'll fly towards it.

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:28.101
They may attack
elsewhere at the same time.

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:30.270
Therefore, most of
our knights and mages

00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:32.314
will stand by at the palace,

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:35.025
ready to counter the
enemy's movements.

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:37.694
I'll follow swiftly as I can.

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:38.904
Right.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:41.239
As you command, my queen.

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:44.201
[IRIS gasps]

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.410
[AIDE 01A]
Hm?

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.120
[SHEAMA]
Mm?

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.664
Queen Iris, this pains me,

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:52.083
but I must ask
to leave your side.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.001
[SHEAMA gasps]

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:54.836
Why?

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:56.505
Sir Phious.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.925
As a Knight of Light, my
greatest duty is to serve you.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:02.761
I will do anything
to keep you safe.

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:05.138
Forgive me for
speaking so bluntly,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.807
but it's apparent that
you're still exhausted

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:09.017
from your previous battles.

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:10.602
Which is why we
should stay with her.

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:12.354
Queen Iris needs our
support now more than ever‐‐

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:13.855
I realize that.

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:16.942
I plan to search for a way to
quickly restore her strength,

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.777
and then return at once.

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:22.864
But you can't.

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:25.450
Who do you expect to lead
the knights while you're away?

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:30.163
Our kingdom needs its queen.
She is its heart and its soul.

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:32.290
She is also its
strongest defender.

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:35.001
Therefore, her
health is paramount.

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:43.051
Sir Phious, I appreciate
your concern but don't worry.

00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:44.594
I'll recover eventually.

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:45.428
Yes, but‐‐

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.847
Phious!

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:53.228
For the time being,
let's get our troops prepared.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.064
Give the knights drills to run;
the mages as well.

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:58.775
Just ensure that none of
them exhaust themselves.

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:00.235
[SHEAMA]
Right.

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:04.447
Right...

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.996
[PHIOUS]
Sheama.

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.706
[SHEAMA]
Mm?

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:15.876
I meant what I said.
We need the Queen's strength.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.336
[SHEAMA] We also need
our Knight Commander.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:21.464
You can't just abandon us
on the eve of a battle.

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:23.300
I won't be gone for long.

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:25.010
And I'll be leaving
my knights behind.

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:27.012
I've no doubt that
they'll fight well.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.598
And why's that?
Who's going to lead them?

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.018
[PHIOUS]
You will... until I return.

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.103
[SHEAMA]
There's no way. Are you kidding?

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:37.939
Should I put on armor and
pick up a sword while I'm at it?

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:40.275
If you won't then
I'll have to ask Theo.

00:06:40.317 --> 00:06:43.236
[gasps] Just let this go.

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:45.572
Queen Iris will never
approve your plan.

00:06:45.614 --> 00:06:48.617
And without any leads, it'll
just be a waste of time.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:50.535
I have one.

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:54.956
[SHEAMA]
I see.

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:59.586
[SHEAMA] Please refrain from
doing anything rash, Commander.

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:18.855
[ALANTIA]
Ah. You're here about the queen.

00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:20.690
[PHIOUS]
Yes. I was hoping that you would

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:24.903
know of a way to
help her, Lord Alantia.

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:27.572
[ALANTIA]
I may know one.

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:30.533
That said, it could
prove dangerous.

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:32.494
Oh? How so?

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:34.079
The Queen fought Bahl,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.956
and in the wake of
that great battle,

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:38.458
she found herself
quite weakened.

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:41.461
[ALANTIA]
At first glance,

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:44.297
it looks like
Her Majesty is better.

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:46.174
But she overworked
the magical nerves

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.176
that she uses to cast spells,

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:51.429
and they still need
time to recover.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.849
Pure soul permeates the
atmosphere of this kingdom.

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:56.559
Ordinarily, we'd just wait for

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:59.521
its effects to heal
her naturally, but...

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:08.321
I know where pure
soul is condensed‐‐

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:11.491
where its blessings
are stronger:

00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:15.203
The Inland Spring
produces Shining Droplets.

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:19.541
If we can collect them,
then they can heal her.

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:22.085
[PHIOUS]
The Shining... Droplets.

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:24.421
But it's a dangerous prospect.

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:30.343
The spring is quite
difficult to reach.

00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:33.221
Even for Sir Phious,
Knight‐commander,

00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:36.599
and Alantia,
leader of the elves?

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:41.563
[ALANTIA] Hmph. Who can say?
We would just have to try.

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:44.357
Then please, show me the way.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:46.443
Hold on. What of the war?

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:49.696
[PHIOUS gasps] I argued
that this took precedence,

00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:51.573
and the Queen granted me leave.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.199
That's surprising.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:56.619
But since you're here,
I will aid you in this endeavor.

00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:58.329

Don't lose focus,
no matter what happens.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:57.097
[MAGE 09D]
Lady Sheama.

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.099
This linked incantation

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.810
draws a great deal
of power from the rune.

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:06.314
More than anyone can
handle... including me.

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:09.192
If just one caster
loses focus or falters,

00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:12.278
the spell will fail and cause a
backlash.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.155
Is that what caused
you to collapse?

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:16.366
‐‐[MAGE 09C] It's our fault.
‐‐[MAGE 09D] How awful.

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:22.330
The Armies of Black are
threatening our borders.

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:24.082
No one can fight
back but the Queen,

00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:27.377
her honorable Knights
of Light, and you:

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:30.171
the finest mages in White.

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:32.507
If we're to defend the
people of our kingdom,

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:34.717
all of us must work as one.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.511
[MAGES gasp]

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:38.138

Lady Sheama!

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.810
Is something the matter?

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:45.770
[KNIGHT 09A]
It's the commander!

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:47.147
Sir Phious is missing!

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:49.440
[SHEAMA gasps]
He really left?!

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:54.279
[SHEAMA] Queen Iris.
I'm sorry, but Phious has‐

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.197
Yes, I heard.

00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:01.327
[SHEAMA] He must have gone to
look for a treatment for you.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:02.704
What should we do?

00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:06.791
We can't afford to pursue him.
We can only pray for his return.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:11.129
If we're attacked before
he comes back, then so be it.

00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:12.422
Right.

00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:14.674
I'm so sorry, my queen.

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:17.010
Don't be, Sheama.

00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:19.429
You have nothing
to apologize for.

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:24.475
[IRIS]
Now, back to the tower.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.644
Continue your drills.

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:28.188
[SHEAMA]
Right.

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:35.195
It's this way.

00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:38.406
[PHIOUS]
Down there?

00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:41.534
[ALANTIA] Few who have
entered have ever returned.

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:43.119
Will you go?

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.165
Well, I'm not about
to get cold feet now.

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:53.171
[ALANTIA]
Very well. Let's proceed.

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:54.672
[PHIOUS]
Right.

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:05.016
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
I can't tell anyone about

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:09.229
my meeting with the queen,
or the promises we made.

00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:12.815
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
The skyship was waiting,

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:16.236
ready to take me back
to the Kingdom of Black.

00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:18.154
Back "home."

00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:28.831
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
I don't know if it's connected

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:30.875
to what happened with Adel,

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:33.920
but I've been denied
access to the palace.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.383
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS] It isn't
really much of an inconvenience.

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:39.926
I'll be fine.

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:47.141
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
But the Queen of Light, Iris...

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:50.979
...her small shoulders
are carrying so much.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.190
Not just the weight
of her kingdom's people‐‐

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:56.317
the weight of the world.

00:12:57.819 --> 00:13:01.364
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
I'll help her. I'll find a way.

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:05.326
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
She may be a queen,

00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:08.746
but no one should have to
endure that kind of hardship.

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:10.540
Not on their own.

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:13.710
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Wait for me,

00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:16.504
and someday I'll
come back to you.

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:18.631
[yelling]

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:24.554
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS,
VALLUS grunting]

00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:26.055
That's enough!

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:31.060
[VALLUS] How do you feel
after your trip to White?

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:35.398
I had hoped it would
sharpen your focus.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.899
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Vallus.

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:38.818
What is it?

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.154
Are you okay with
the way things are?

00:13:41.195 --> 00:13:42.322
[VALLUS]
Hm?

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.910
[VALLUS] It's war. The people
of White are once again enemies.

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:49.287
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS grunts]

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:52.081
[VALLUS]
Such is His Majesty's will.

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:57.712
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
But is it right?

00:13:57.754 --> 00:13:59.589
Is what right?

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:03.176
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Do you think the king

00:14:03.217 --> 00:14:06.429
always had a black heart,
or did the throne change him?

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:08.681
[VALLUS]
There is power in darkness.

00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:12.226
And in Black, the king is the
source of that power.

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:15.730
His authority is absolute
beyond questioning.

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:19.150
It's just the way
of the world, right?

00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:19.984
For the time being,

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:23.488
I think it would
behoove you to accept that.

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:26.699
It's the nature of
darkness to envelop all.

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:30.953
Good... evil... everything.

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:32.038
Darkness grows.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.041
It is a veil that
must never be lifted.

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:39.003
It will continue to expand as
long as there is space for it.

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:41.339
And that has been
the truth of this world

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:44.133
since it came into being.

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:47.470
But hasn't anyone ever
bothered to question that?

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:49.847
No one really knows
if black and white,

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:53.726
light and dark are meant
to struggle like they do.

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:56.979
Why should we think that
things are as they should be?

00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:58.314
[VALLUS]
Believe it or not,

00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:02.068
but I think that His Majesty
might wonder the same thing.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.861
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
I bet he does.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:06.989
But this path of conquest
and destruction...

00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:09.409
...it might just
make things worse.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.536
"Once darkness wins the war,

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:14.163
our world will finally
be able to rest."

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:16.833
I feel like that
idea is deceptive.

00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:20.169
This isn't for you
to decide. Not yet.

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:23.214
It's the king's duty
to lead and show results.

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:25.133
It's not my place
to pass judgment

00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:29.303
on the future based
on vague speculation.

00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:30.513
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
I know.

00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:33.099
When your time comes
to ascend to the throne,

00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:34.934
you may plot
whatever path you wish

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:37.687
and use me to
carve it into being.

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:42.066
Thank you, Vallus.

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:45.653
No. You have nothing to
thank me for just yet.

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:46.821
Raise your weapon.

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:49.115
You do still hope
to surpass me, right?

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:50.658
Of course. Huh?

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.578
[GROZA panting]

00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:57.165

Groza!

00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:00.877
Do you have news?

00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:04.547
His Highness and I
have been instructed

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:07.842
to exterminate some savage
monsters out on the frontier.

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:09.051
Instructed?

00:16:09.093 --> 00:16:12.096
By the king. His Majesty
said that they're too powerful

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:15.183
for our soldiers to handle.

00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:16.684
Are we to leave immediately?

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:20.146
[GROZA] That's right.
It sounds like an emergency.

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:49.592
[KING OF DARKNESS]
Vallus.

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:53.012
Yes. Your army
is assembled, my king.

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:55.097
What of the vanguard?

I'll follow with haste.

[KING OF DARKNESS] The side of
light has been veiled in shadow.

00:17:14.992 --> 00:17:17.411
Faced with the full
might of darkness,

00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:20.373
it will be snuffed
out with ease.

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:23.751
[GROZA]
I'm told that the monsters

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:26.212
were last seen somewhere nearby.

00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:27.838

track of where we‐‐ [gasps]

That seemed too easy.

I don't feel like these
were the right monsters.
