[footsteps]

00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:25.234
[GROZA] I can't believe I have
to head straight to White.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:28.070
Not even a moment
to catch my breath.

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:41.041
That said...
the prince is there.

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:52.094
[GROZA laughs]
So it's not all that bad.

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:38.533
[BLUE CATS laughing, chirping]

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:56.510

[BLUE CAT B screams]

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.474
[ADEL] Thank you for lending
your aid to our kingdom.

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:05.268
Words can't express
our gratitude.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.647
I cast a single spell,
and then took my leave.

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.192
Your troops were brave,
but many lost their lives.

00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:14.152
Our troops aren't all human.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:19.574
Monsters make up our vanguard.
And well, to be quite frank...

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:22.661
Most are entirely in
the thrall of our king.

00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:25.664
They live, die,
and kill at his whim.

00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:28.125
This may be, but I
would imagine that

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:31.503
some of them wished
for peace just as we do.

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:35.465
I'll pray for them‐‐that their
souls may rest eternally.

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:37.509
My queen, I'm not sure that's‐‐

00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:39.678
You're a font of compassion.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.932
I offer my gratitude on
behalf of all my people.

00:03:43.974 --> 00:03:46.643
Upon returning to
the Kingdom of Black,

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:50.313
I'll seek an audience with my
king at the soonest opportunity.

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.858
And ask him to end
this war for good.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:53.984
[gasps]

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:57.195
What? But you said
your king is a madman.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:04:01.908
I appreciate your concern. That
said, you inspired this move.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.660
[PHIOUS gasps]

00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:07.664
It was our conversation that
helped me steel my resolve.

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:08.915
[PHIOUS grunts]

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:12.711
You're correct.
The denizens of Black

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:16.298
don't want this war any more
than the people of White do.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.717
If there's a chance that I
can help both our kingdoms,

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.178
I'll take it.

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:25.056
Ah. I see. [laughs]

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:29.603
You can't. The king kills
dissenters. It would be futile.

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:34.858
[ADEL] No need to worry. I'm
sure everything will work out.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.193
Adel...

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:37.527
‐‐[door opens]
‐‐[ALL gasp]

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.698
[SCOUT A] Excuse me! Another
ship is coming from Black.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.241
Truly?

00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:47.996
[AIDE A] Well, my queen.
What shall we do?

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:53.502
[IRIS]
Show them inside.

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:55.420
‐‐[AIDE A] Your Grace.
‐‐[SCOUT A] Understood.

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:04.012
My greetings, Queen Iris.
I am Lady Groza.

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:05.972
Please forgive
my sudden arrival.

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:09.059
Sure. May we ask
what brings you to us?

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.062
[GROZA]
I bear a letter from my king.

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:15.315
His Majesty looks forward
to your response.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.155
[IRIS grunts]

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:51.977
[gasps, sighs]

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.564
What is it, my queen?

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:59.860
He wishes to extend
the ceasefire's duration

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:02.487
until the damage Bahl
caused can be repaired.

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:05.156
[gasps] He wrote that?

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.283
Yes.

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:08.034
[ADEL gasping]

00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:10.996
Well, that's a
pleasant surprise.

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:14.416
We have time. You can
face the king later.

00:06:17.752 --> 00:06:20.088
Will you accept this?

00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:25.260
[IRIS]
I will.

00:06:25.302 --> 00:06:29.806
Respond to the King immediately.
We'll extend the truce.

00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:33.018
Right. As you wish, my queen.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.780
I'll have a fresh room prepared.

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:47.866
Though I fear you'll
have to wait some time.

00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:50.368
Oh. Thanks.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.079
In the meantime, would you
like me to show you around

00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:54.456
the Kingdom of White a bit?

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:59.544
[gasps] That would be an honor.
I'd like nothing more.

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:03.840
Hold on. Queen Iris,
aren't you recovering?

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.843
[IRIS] No. Thanks to you,
I feel much better.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:08.511
Well, if you're sure...

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:09.679
[IRIS]
I am.

00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:12.974
And I think a bit of fresh air
could do me some good right now.

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:22.067
[giggles]

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:28.198
Huh? Ah!

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:31.368
Phious, Sheama. And Queen
Iris. Good to see ya!

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:33.244
Uh. Who are they?

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:34.746
They're our guests.

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:38.208
These people came all the way
from the Kingdom of Black.

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:40.961
They're from Black?

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:42.587
[whimpering]

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:46.549
Heh. Don't be scared.
We won't eat you, right?

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:48.051
Right.

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:52.013
[GROZA grumbles]

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:56.059
[GROZA]
Hm?

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.314
Okay. I guess some people

00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:03.608
from the Kingdom of
Black can be nice.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.026
That's right.

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:08.405
Tell me, Theo.
What're you doing here?

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:12.450
Oh! [panting]

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.995
[ALL]
Huh...?

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:17.998
[BLUE CATS whimpering]

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:21.001
I was just treating this
little guy's wounds.

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:26.131
[BLUE CAT A whines]

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:39.436
[gasps]

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:43.189
Theo, how'd you learn
to use magic like that?

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:47.944
Practice. Plus, I've gotten
lessons from Sheama.

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:50.280
Yeah. He has real talent.

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:53.908
If he works hard, he might even
come to surpass me one day.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:54.909
What?

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:57.871
I thought you'd planned to
join the Knights of Light.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:09:01.124
Yeah, but if I did that,

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:03.376
they'd have to demote
you to vice‐commander.

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:04.377
[PHIOUS]
Uh!

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:06.379
[ADEL laughs]
Sounds like you need

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:08.673
to watch your back,
Commander Phious.

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:11.217
[GROUP laughing]

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:25.440
[BLUE CATS chirping]

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:28.485
[THEO]
You guys be careful, okay?

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:31.362
Those critters sure
are well behaved here.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.073
Unlike like the ones
in our kingdom.

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:37.744
[BLACK CATS]
Meow...

00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:39.287
[MERCHANT A gasping]

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:46.586
[ADEL] Back home,
they're real trouble‐makers.

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.963
Yeah, but I've always thought
they were kinda cute.

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.173
Yeah.

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:51.257
[GROZA laughs]

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:53.343
[IRIS]
I'd like to see one.

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:57.388
[ADEL] No, cute is so not
the word for those things.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.391
They're shady little rogues
with looks to match.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:03.853
Oh, yeah? I feel like the same
could be said about you.

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:06.064
[SHEAMA]
Hmm... Fair point.

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.525
[THEO] Those dark clothes
are a little scary.

00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:11.736
Where we're from, this
is how everyone dresses.

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.990
[ADEL laughs] Just noticed
that everyone up here

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.535
tends to wear a lot of white.

00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:22.122
I guess we do.

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:23.832
[gasping]

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.589
I think your outfits are lovely!

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.466
I feel the same about yours!

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:35.426
They're quite elegant.

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:39.097
[GROZA] Heh! Say...
Why don't we try swapping?

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:41.474
Sure! Good idea.
That sounds like fun.

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:44.853
Wait, Sheama. Are you serious?

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:46.521
Hear me out...

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.947
[PHIOUS, ADEL]
Huh? Wait, you want us to what?

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:59.659
Why are we the ones doing this?

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:03.705
Lovely. You're like
the living symbols

00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:05.957
of our kingdoms'
blossoming friendship!

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:09.002
Also, that's a good
look for ya, Phious.

00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:10.170
[IRIS, GROZA grunt]

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:12.755
Yeah? You think so?

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:17.552
[ADEL]
Do you wanna try this?

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:19.804
No. But thanks.

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:21.764
[GROZA grunts]

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:24.225
Well, that means it's our turn.

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.477
Yes. Let's get to it.

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:28.771
[IRIS gasping]

00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:33.151
This is so much fun already. Ha!

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:34.569
Uh?!

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:42.660
[GROZA]
Hmm...

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:45.914
I wonder which one of you
I should swap outfits with.

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.332
Huh?

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.795
[GROZA laughs]

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:54.464
Definitely you!

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:56.716
Um...

00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:00.678
[IRIS]
I'm not sure...

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.639
[GROZA]
Hm?

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.390
I think you should do it.

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:06.267
Obviously we can't
allow a messenger

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:09.229
from Black to wear
Your Majesty's dress.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.106
But it's no problem
if you wear hers.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:14.442
[IRIS]
Right. But...

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:19.113
Ah, well then,
I guess I've no choice.

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:22.867
What are you‐‐?

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.423
[GROZA laughing]

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:39.926
Now, let's get you dressed.

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:41.970
[IRIS]
Uh...

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:52.689
[IRIS]
Um. How do I look?

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.399
[GROZA gasps]

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.531
Be nice.

00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:03.825
You look absolutely wonderful!

00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:07.203
Heh! Do you mean it?
Thanks so much.

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:09.205
I'm glad you let me try it on!

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:10.206
Happy to do it!

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:12.458
Now let's get out there
and show the boys, okay?

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.837
Uh, that sounds a
bit embarrassing.

00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:16.796
[GROZA grunts]

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:20.508
Well, in that case, why don't
you let me try it on next?

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.928
Of course. Then I could
try your outfit.

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:34.063
I think her dress will
suit you well, Groza.

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:36.482
Yes. I think so, too.

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:48.328
[door opens]

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:49.746
[ALL]
Hm?

00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:52.290
Hey. It took you
three long enough.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.421
What do you think?

00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:01.716
I'd say the both of them
look quite ravishing.

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:03.217
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Hm?

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:09.098
[ADEL grunts]
Yeah. I'll say.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.893
[PHIOUS]
Mm‐hm. They look very nice.

00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:14.312
Honestly, it's odd.

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:16.731
Seeing my clothes on somebody
else feels strange,

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:18.691
but it's also sort of fun.

00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:20.276
Yeah.

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:22.653
Well... Which one
would you pick?

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:24.113
Huh?

00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:25.823
What did you say?

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.242
[GROZA grunts]

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:30.578
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Uh...

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.121
Um. They both look great.

00:14:32.163 --> 00:14:34.582
Don't think I could rank them.

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:37.210
[GROZA laughs]

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.087
[laughing]

00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:41.381
[ADEL]
What's wrong? Too shy to say?

00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:43.883
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
No. I just‐‐ Shut up.

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:44.884
[THEO]
Hm?

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:58.272
[PHIOUS grunts] I'll beat you
next time. But I yield.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:14:59.774
[GROZA grumbles]

00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:01.734
[ADEL] Heh. You'd think
that a Knight Commander

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:04.529
would have a better
mind for strategy.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:08.241
You might wanna do yourself
a favor and take a break.

00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:11.202
Um. Perhaps we could‐‐?

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:13.037
No way. I'm not finished.

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:13.996
[GROZA chuckles]

00:15:14.038 --> 00:15:17.667
[SHEAMA] Brother.
The sun is about to set.

00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:20.002
Let's take the envoys
to their rooms.

00:15:20.044 --> 00:15:21.671
Oh. All right, then.

00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:23.172
We don't have to stop yet.

00:15:23.214 --> 00:15:24.298
[GROUP]
Hm?

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.552
It's just... I'm having fun.

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:29.846
I don't get to
socialize that often.

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:32.223
This has been a rare treat.

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:34.058
Your Majesty.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.893
I understand.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.437
That's kinda your fault.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.689
You could come over
and play anytime.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.274
You're the Queen, right?

00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:43.276
It's not that simple, Theo.

00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:44.902
The Queen has great power,

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.405
but she also has her
duty to the kingdom.

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:52.285
[IRIS laughs]

00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:02.795
Okay. What say we keep playin'
till your Knight Commander

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:05.047
manages to kick my butt?

00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:07.675
Adel. You're speaking
to a queen.

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:10.094
Right. Apologies, Your Grace.

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:13.973
That's quite all right. There's
no need to stand on ceremony.

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:16.893
[stomach grumbles]

00:16:16.934 --> 00:16:18.644
[IRIS gasping]

00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:22.273
[stomach grumbling]

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:27.028
[ADEL laughs] It sounds like
you two are getting peckish.

00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:28.571
Yeah.

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:31.491
Here's an idea. Why don't we
all have dinner together?

00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:32.617
That sounds great!

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:35.244
The palace food was starting
to get a little boring.

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:37.038
I've never had a meal in White.

00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:39.457
I'm excited to try
out your cuisine.

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:42.793
Sorry to disappoint,
but this'll be simple fare.

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:45.505
That said, I'll do my best.

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:10.530
[SHEAMA]
Hope you enjoy it.

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:13.282
[ALL laugh]

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:14.867
[ALL gasp]

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:15.910
[GROZA sniffs]

00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:17.954
Wow. It smells delicious.

00:17:17.995 --> 00:17:20.164
There's more bread
where this came from,

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:22.083
so take as much as you want.

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:25.795
Oh! I brought something
with me from home.

00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:26.921
You should try it out.

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:28.881
It's called anchovy paste.

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:31.425
Um. So, is it a condiment?

00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:33.344
It's all gooey.

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:35.680
I'd love to try it.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.401
So what do you think of it?

00:17:48.442 --> 00:17:51.571
How does our cuisine
measure up to yours?

00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:54.365
This soup tastes the same
as the palace food.

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:55.950
Almost flavorless.

00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:57.076
[IRIS]
Uh!

00:17:57.118 --> 00:17:58.953
What? No way.

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:02.873
This soup's delicious!

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:04.000
You like this?

00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:06.419
At the very least,
it needs more salt.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.296
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Mm‐hm.

00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:11.340
Well, we're used
to stronger flavors.

00:18:11.382 --> 00:18:12.883
Ah!

00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:17.138
Have a taste and you'll
see what I mean.

00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:19.348
Sure. I would love to.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:21.851
Frankly... it doesn't
look great.

00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:24.979
Agreed, but that doesn't
mean it'll taste bad.

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:27.106
I wanna try some!

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:33.654
That's powerful.

00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:35.990
It's so salty.

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:39.368
You season your foods far
more heavily down in Black.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.078
I don't like it!

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.873
Ah, tastes like home,
right, Groza?

00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:46.334
I've barely been gone
and I miss it.

00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:49.629
It's strange. Even our
foods are different.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.965
That may be true, but if we
want our kingdoms to coexist,

00:18:53.007 --> 00:18:54.884
then we should all try to
understand each other,

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:57.178
even when it comes
to things like this.

00:18:57.219 --> 00:18:58.971
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Mm.

00:18:59.013 --> 00:19:00.181
[gasps]

00:19:00.222 --> 00:19:01.682
[laughs]

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.896
Did you just mix those?

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:17.823
That's a great idea!

00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:20.910
There's no way they
complement each other.

00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:26.582
[ADEL]
Wow...

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:28.959
Believe it or not, the
combination tastes great.

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:30.294
[laughs]

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:33.881
Let's try it, then.

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:35.257
Sure.

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:36.384
[PHIOUS grunts]

00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:38.511
I wanna try, too!

00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:44.183
It's perfect!

00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:45.685
So savory.

00:19:45.726 --> 00:19:47.436
Yes. It's good.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.980
Hey, sis. Gimme more!

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:57.363
That tasted amazing!

00:19:57.405 --> 00:20:00.074
I can't believe
they paired so well.

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:02.785
Yeah, but we're not gonna
be able to taste this again

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:04.662
unless we come
back someday.

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:06.997
We cleaned out the whole jar.

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:10.084
Too bad. But tasty as
that anchovy soup was,

00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:12.044
there's one dish
that's even better.

00:20:12.086 --> 00:20:14.547
Yeah? Well, what is it?

00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:17.508
Wild greens picked
by Queen Iris herself.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.843
Huh?

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:22.304
He's right.
They're rather delicious.

00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:25.182
Wild greens picked by the queen?

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:34.442
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
I've had wild greens before.

00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:35.609
That said,

00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:38.863
considering how your land is
constantly bathed in light,

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:42.533
I imagine the greens that
grow here taste much better.

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:43.868
Let's get some!

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:45.953
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:50.249
Let's all go out, and
pick greens together.

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:10.269
Lady Groza.

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:12.146
Are you having trouble
sleeping, too?

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:13.522
Yeah.

00:21:13.564 --> 00:21:15.608
[grunts] What's the matter?

00:21:15.649 --> 00:21:19.862
Would you like to talk about it?
I'm a decent listener.

00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:21.363
It's the Queen of Light.

00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:25.117
I guess I just realized
she's a regular person.

00:21:25.159 --> 00:21:27.620
I know just how you feel.

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:33.709
I want you to know that you
will always have my support.

00:21:33.751 --> 00:21:37.713
I mean it. I will see you
take the crown, my prince.

00:21:37.755 --> 00:21:40.257
Thank you. Truly.

00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:50.059
Now, forgive me, but I insist
that you get some sleep.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.937
We need our prince healthy.

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:55.981
And you won't have fun
picking greens if you're tired.

00:21:56.023 --> 00:21:57.233
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
You're right.

00:21:57.274 --> 00:21:59.109
I'll go to bed soon.
