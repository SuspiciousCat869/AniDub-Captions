00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:22.814
[IRIS] It's true.
There is one who ravages my land

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.526
for no reason but to
satisfy his whim.

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:29.112
Bahl does the same
in our country.

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:33.242
I sympathize. However,
your king simply wants

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:35.786
the incarnation of
destruction out of the way

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:38.956
so he can focus his
aggression on my country.

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:41.750
That's only true for
the current king.

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:46.046
[IRIS]
Yes. Once this king is gone.

00:00:46.088 --> 00:00:46.922
[IRIS grunts]

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:34.988
[door opens]

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.699
[SHEAMA]
Queen Iris. I'm back from Metis.

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:40.494
Along with the rest
of your mage force.

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:43.955
Oh. I'm talking to
an empty chair.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:48.001
[PHIOUS] It's a long story. How
goes the rebuilding of Metis?

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:50.629
[SHEAMA] About as well
as we could hope for.

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:52.339
I'm glad.

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:54.800
Read this.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.093
[SHEAMA]
Mm?

00:02:58.345 --> 00:02:59.680
You're kidding me.

00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:02.516
The King of Black asked us
to help him kill Bahl.

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:06.019
And now, the queen is on her
way to fight at his side?

00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:07.229
Yes.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.023
[SHEAMA]
And it says that the envoys

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:13.985
are to stay here
as hostages. So...

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:18.073
If they were to turn violent,
while Her Majesty's absent‐‐

00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:21.493
That's why I'm here‐‐
in case they try something.

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.709
But honestly,
they don't seem so bad.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.335
[SHEAMA]
You don't say.

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:33.338
I guess I'll find out myself
when I meet them.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.803
[yawns] I need to
rest for a bit.

00:03:39.845 --> 00:03:42.931
But introduce me to
them later, would you?

00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:45.767
Sure. Good work out there.

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:52.232
[PHIOUS]
Be safe, my queen.

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:57.696
[MERCHANT A]
Here you go.

00:03:57.738 --> 00:03:59.281
'Preciate it, Mister.

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:03.285
No problem. You come
back soon, okay?

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.457
I couldn't say why,
but I've got a bad feeling.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:11.209
My. Well, that's frightening.

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:14.796
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.715
[MERCHANT A]
It isn't safe here.

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:32.230
[BAHL chuckles] It looks like
they prepared a welcome party.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.861
That's him.

00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:40.822
Once Bahl has set foot on the
ground, we can spring our trap.

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:44.159
We'll hold him in place and
launch an all‐out attack.

00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:46.453
I'll leave the siege
weapons to you, Groza.

00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:47.788
Understood.

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:50.791
The beast known as Bahl
is fast approaching.

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:53.251
His objective is
to raze our land,

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.962
and butcher our
people for sport.

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:58.632
We will suffer his
barbarity no longer.

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:03.136
His vainglorious rampage
shall end today.

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:05.931
You're the elite defenders
of the Kingdom of Black.

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.390
Prove your mettle!

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:10.018
[SOLDIERS cheer]

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.655
[BAHL]
Oh?

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:24.991
Greetings, Bahl.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:27.744
By my King's order,
I've come to slay you.

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:29.037
[grunts]

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.874
[VALLUS yells]

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:38.046
[BAHL laughs]
Don't get ahead of yourself.

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:40.507
Our fun is just beginning.

00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:43.343
[VALLUS grunts]
We'll see.

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:45.470
[BAHL] Did you gather
all of these toys

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.597
just for my entertainment?

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:52.394
[BAHL] I am most appreciative
of your hospitality.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:56.523
Thank you. I had feared
this might be boring.

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.610
What? But how?

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:05.073
[BAHL laughs]
Well done. Good show.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:11.705
He swept them aside
like they were nothing.

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.123
[BAHL]
Not to be rude,

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:15.959
but would you mind bringing
out some more toys?

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:19.004
Uh! How dare you mock us!

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.298
[BAHL laughing]

00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:28.847
Draw him in as
close as possible.

00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:31.349
Fire!

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.979
Got him.

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:39.107
[BAHL] Are you that eager
to attract my attention?

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:40.734
[BAHL yells]

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:45.113
Arrogant monster.
Solitaire Orage!

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:51.620
[BAHL laughs] A spell like
that won't even scratch me.

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:54.456
[GROZA gasps]
He's as strong as they say.

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:56.708
Let's launch a
second volley. Ready?

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.710
‐‐[SOLDIER A] Ma'am!
‐‐Then fire!

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:03.506
[BAHL laughs]
Throwing a tantrum, eh?

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:06.176
[gasps, screams]

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:13.975
[SOLDIER A groans]

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:18.980
Go!

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:20.982
[GARGOYLES squawking]

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:29.366
[BAHL]
Huh... How courageous.

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:51.262
[BAHL]
What trickery is this?

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.268
[BAHL] Do you really think that
you can outwit one such as I?

00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:31.886
[GARGOYLE MAGE B squawks]

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.683
[BAHL chuckles]

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:47.694
[BAHL]
I wonder what this feels like.

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:51.072
[laughs] Was that all you had?

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:03.376
[BAHL]
Ohh...

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:08.715
[GROZA] That wasn't even close
to being all we had!

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:11.760
Now then: Révolte Éclair!

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:20.977
Twin blades of the void.
Come forth and strike.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.192
[VALLUS grunts]

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:35.867
All right. We did it.

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:40.747
[VALLUS gasps]

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:44.876
[BAHL laughs] That offered me
some real amusement.

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.544
For a moment.

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.379
No. There's no way.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.341
[BAHL] If you run out of tricks
to show me, I'll kill you.

00:09:51.382 --> 00:09:53.885
So keep dancing, if you can.

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:55.303
[MAGES gasp]

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:56.513
[GROZA, VALLUS grunt]

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:04.604
[BAHL] Come along, now.
We're not done playing yet.

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:06.689
It's not a game.

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:14.697
[VALLUS grunting]

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:21.746
[BAHL yells]

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:26.376
[VALLUS grunting]

00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:28.545
I... can't move.

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:31.089
[BAHL chuckles]

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:33.133
What... should we do?

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:35.844
[VALLUS grunting]

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:39.055
[BAHL]
I think it's time I ended this.

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:51.025
[gasps]

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:59.701
[BAHL]
Ah... Rescuing your vassals?

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:01.911
How uncharacteristically
kind of you.

00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:04.664
Why not embrace the light
while you're at it?

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:06.666
It would save me a
good bit of trouble...

00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:09.043
...King of Darkness.

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:15.508
[KING OF DARKNESS]
The World's Egoism.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.802
[BAHL grunts]
What was that?

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.680
[KING OF DARKNESS] There is no
better name for one such as you,

00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:23.016
who defies the balance.

00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:27.395
[BAHL] Well, at least you aren't
calling me a dragon or a god.

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.397
I was never fond of such names.

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:31.191
Although, I'd much prefer it

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:33.902
if you refrained from
naming me at all.

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:35.820
[KING OF DARKNESS]
You should know this,

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.989
but I care not for
your preference.

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:42.035
I don't intend to do anything
that will be to your liking.

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:51.544
[BAHL] Ha! There's nothing
to you but base instinct.

00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:12.190
[BAHL groaning]

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:26.955
[BAHL laughs]
Now I'm having fun!

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:34.754
Hey... What just happened?

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:36.464
[BAHL yelling]

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:38.174
The king!

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:41.261
[BAHL yelling]

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.694
[BAHL] You aren't quite living
up to your boasts!

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.197
[KING OF DARKNESS]
Damn you!

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:18.965
[BAHL]
Balance be damned.

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:22.593
With your death, I'll send
the scales flying!

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:27.307
[BAHL]
What's this?

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:35.565
Calida. Lux, Puram.
Lucem. Bind my foe!

00:13:35.606 --> 00:13:38.901
[BAHL]
The Queen of Light. But how?

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:42.363
[GROZA] I can't believe it.
She's actually here.

00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:44.991
Yes. They won her over.

00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:51.331
[gasps]

00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:03.634
[BAHL grunts]

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:06.554
[BAHL]
Curse you!

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:08.473
I'll do it this once.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:12.977
[BAHL groaning]

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:15.688
[KING OF DARKNESS]
Frustrating, isn't it, Bahl?

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:19.192
[BAHL]
Be silent, you arrogant whelp!

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.825
[BAHL grunting]

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:32.413
[BAHL] You're a vile creature,
aren't you?

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:34.916
A wretched being of
mindless instinct.

00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:38.086
Has your fear defeated
your hunger?

00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:40.380
Will you abandon your
last shred of pride

00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:42.298
and uphold that
meaningless balance

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.008
just to save your own skin?

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:48.179
[KING OF DARKNESS] Howl all you
want. This is the end for you.

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:51.182
You shall writhe in
torment for eternity.

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:55.019
In the depths of Tartarus,
my Scorching Prison.

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:58.856
[BAHL]
Wait. Why not just kill me?

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.775
[KING OF DARKNESS grunts]

00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:06.948
[BAHL] Forget I asked.
The answer's obvious, actually.

00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:10.827
Farewell. Till next we meet.

00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:19.335
[KING OF DARKNESS]
Well done.

00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:22.338
With this slight tilting
of the scales,

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.258
you've carved me a path.

00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:02.211
[SHEAMA] So you're the special
envoy, and he's your guard.

00:16:05.673 --> 00:16:09.302
Thank you for granting us
an audience, Lady Sheama.

00:16:09.343 --> 00:16:10.511
Well met.

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:14.265
It is, of course, an honor to
speak with the royal court mage.

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:19.187
That said, I didn't expect
you to be so beautiful.

00:16:19.228 --> 00:16:21.939
Spare me the flattery.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.484
[ADEL]
My apologies.

00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:26.694
I've spoken with
the Knight Commander.

00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:30.114
You told him that the people
of Black are against this war.

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:32.158
Is that the truth?

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:38.247
Yes. I would swear that
on my life, but...

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:40.958
He says that they're
bound to the king's will.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.713
Those who defy him
are killed on the spot.

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.089
[SHEAMA]
I see.

00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:50.843
[gasps]

00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:53.054
What the‐‐?

00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:55.348
Hey! Come back here!

00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:57.099
Wait, Phious, look!

00:16:57.141 --> 00:16:58.851
[PHIOUS]
Queen Iris!

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.739
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS panting]

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:21.541
[IRIS gasps]

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:47.483
Your Grace. Are you all right?

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:51.946
It's over now. Bahl has fallen.

00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:53.322
Good.

00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:54.824
[PHIOUS]
Queen Iris!

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:03.791
Your Majesty. Are you all right?
Please talk to me.

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:04.917
Oh, no.

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:06.752
She doesn't appear
to be wounded.

00:18:06.794 --> 00:18:09.297
So what's wrong with her‐‐
what could've happened?

00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:11.257
[SHEAMA] She must have
used too much power.

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:13.217
We should get her to the palace.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:15.678
[PHIOUS grunts]
Right.

00:18:16.804 --> 00:18:19.849
Excuse us. Please return
to your rooms.

00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:27.148
[IRIS panting]

00:18:31.694 --> 00:18:34.822
She's so weak.
Will she recover?

00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:41.912
[gasps]

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:43.581
[SHEAMA]
She used her body as a conduit

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:46.459
for the immense power
of the progenitor rune.

00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:49.795
[SHEAMA] I can't imagine
the kind of strain

00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:51.464
that must've put on her.

00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:53.507
[gasps]

00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:55.134
[SHEAMA] Go tell the envoy
that she fulfilled

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:58.095
the terms of the alliance.

00:18:58.137 --> 00:18:59.263
[PHIOUS]
But...

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:02.183
[SHEAMA]
Please, just do it.

00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:04.560
Sure. I'll go there now.

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:09.607
[door opens, closes]

00:19:11.233 --> 00:19:13.069
May I come in?

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.698
Seems like you already have.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:22.662
Oh, should I have waited?
Hey. Grab a drink with me.

00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:24.372
Thanks, but I'll pass.

00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:28.834
What's wrong with you? Don't be
such a stick in the mud.

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:30.836
Sorry for hittin' on
the court mage,

00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:32.630
but man was she my type.

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:33.506
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS grunts]

00:19:33.547 --> 00:19:35.132
[ADEL] Though, it seems
you've only got eyes

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:37.343
for the Queen of Light.

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:39.762
This isn't the time for that.

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:45.601
It's not funny.

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:50.064
Fine, I'm sorry.
I'll leave it alone.

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:53.025
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
I'm just... worried about her.

00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:55.695
[ADEL]
Right. I'm sure that's it.

00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:58.030
Hey, what is this?

00:19:58.072 --> 00:20:00.825
I don't recall giving you leave
to move between rooms.

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:05.037
Knight Commander. I wasn't
expecting you to drop in on us.

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:06.622
[PHIOUS grunts]

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:11.293
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS] Excuse me,
sir. But the Queen, how is she?

00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:15.548
[PHIOUS gasps] My queen
is none of your concern!

00:20:15.589 --> 00:20:19.135
But... She should recover soon.

00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:20.845
I'm glad.

00:20:27.935 --> 00:20:29.937
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Knight Commander?

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:34.275
[gasps] No. It's nothing.

00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:35.609
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Hm?

00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:37.820
[ADEL] So did they
manage to beat Bahl?

00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:41.657
Oh. Yes. The terms of
the alliance were met.

00:20:41.699 --> 00:20:42.825
I see.

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:46.454
Guess that means our work up
here is officially complete.

00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:51.709
We'll bid the Queen farewell,

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:53.836
and make our way
back to the mud.

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:57.548
[IRIS panting]

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:06.599
Iris, I need you to realize

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.477
that you don't have
to do all this alone.

00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:20.488
[WORKERS chattering]

00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:25.075
I am way past tired.

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:27.870
Need to hurry home
and take a bath.

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:30.456
Oh. Hello, Vallus.

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:34.752
That was a tough fight.
You did quite well.

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.671
Bahl, the World's Egoism.

00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:40.257
His imprisonment is a
thing to be celebrated.

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:42.676
It's a boon to our country.

00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:45.429
Yes. Sorry, but is
there something

00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:46.806
I can do for you, or‐‐?

00:21:46.847 --> 00:21:49.141
Forgive me,
I'm sure you're tired.

00:21:49.183 --> 00:21:51.894
But I need this delivered
to the Kingdom of White.

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:53.979
[gasps]

00:21:54.021 --> 00:21:55.689
[GROZA]
Understood.

00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:05.491
See you soon, my dear prince.
