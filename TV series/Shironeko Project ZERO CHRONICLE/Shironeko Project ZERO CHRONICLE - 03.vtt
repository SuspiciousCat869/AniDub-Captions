00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.744
[SHEAMA]
Queen Iris.

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:37.704
Queen Iris?

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:38.830
Queen Iris!

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.624
[gasps]

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.919
Oh, Sheama. Apologies.

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:46.421
I... was just lost in thought.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:51.176
<i>You</i> were lost in
thought? Really?

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:54.221
Yes.

00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:55.430
'Kay.

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:56.807
I can't remember.

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:58.600
Did the last queen
always look peaceful,

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:00.936
or did she worry
sometimes, like you do?

00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:01.937
[gasps]

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.355
[SHEAMA chuckles]

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:09.111
[SHEAMA] I'm off to direct
the reconstruction of Metis.

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:11.196
Good. I'm counting on you.

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:12.489
[SHEAMA]
Farewell.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:22.457
[IRIS sighs]

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:27.129
[IRIS]
The former Queen.

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:15.028
[IRIS]
Progenitor Rune, I beseech thee.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.906
Grant peace to the
people of White.

00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:19.825
[SHEAMA]
Hey there. Are you praying?

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.620
Yeah. Just finished actually.

00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:24.538
Good morning.

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.084
[yawns] You're up
early as always.

00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:31.461
[IRIS]
It's the only thing I'm good at.

00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:32.963
[SHEAMA]
Wish I could do it.

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:34.297
You need more sleep.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.258
As much as I like
Phious and Theo,

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.844
I'm sure looking after
them is exhausting.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.930
[SHEAMA] Yup. They're
a handful and then some.

00:03:41.972 --> 00:03:42.764
Want 'em?

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:45.100
I don't think you can
trade them like toys.

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:46.727
[SHEAMA]
I was kidding.

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:48.520
Besides, more responsibility

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:50.856
is the last thing
you need right now.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:52.315
[IRIS]
True.

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:53.567
Hey, Sheama.

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:55.986
What do you think makes
a good Queen of Light?

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.362
What does it take to lead?

00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:58.780
Uh...

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:01.199
Yeah, I got nothin'.

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:02.033
And yet,

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.745
one of us will ascend
to the throne.

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:07.289
Guess we'll find out then.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.460
Regardless of who's chosen,
let's stay friends, okay?

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:12.711
Let's!

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:21.470
Your Majesty.
We serve you faithfully.

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:23.638
Thank you very much
for your time.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.349
With your blessing,
we'll take our leave now.

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:29.728
[SHEAMA]
She's lovely.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.272
The perfect embodiment
of her title.

00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:34.274
"The White Priestess."

00:04:34.316 --> 00:04:36.067
[IRIS]
Yeah. She is.

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.904
It's hard to imagine
anyone else in her role.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:42.073
Her successor will have
a lot to live up to.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.950
So were ya scared?

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:46.453
[IRIS]
Mm. Why do you ask?

00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:48.079
How'd you feel, Sheama?

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:53.168
Well... I was scared,
to be honest.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.213
"The White Priestess dwells
in the heavens with light,

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:59.341
ever bearing her end
of the balance."

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:02.010
To me, it sounds like
she's stuck here.

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:03.845
Talk about a boring life.

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:06.598
[IRIS giggles]
You don't actually mean that.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.475
No. But still.

00:05:08.517 --> 00:05:11.353
Having to maintain that poise
on the throne all the time?

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:12.521
I bet it wears her out.

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:15.148
I bet her life's more
interesting than you think.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.567
Uh‐‐ What do you mean?

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:18.860
She might have fun still.

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:20.862
Maybe she sneaks out
of the palace at night

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:21.822
so she can cut loose.

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:24.825
There's no way.
Our queen would never.

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:27.202
[IRIS] But wouldn't it be funny
if it turned out she did?

00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:31.498
[SHEAMA laughs] You certainly
think outside the box, Iris.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.417
[IRIS, SHEAMA laugh]

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:37.754
[SHEAMA]
Speaking of fun...

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.881
You're still coming over
for dinner tonight, right?

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:42.133
[IRIS]
Yeah. Looking forward to it.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:45.178
Phious has been looking
forward to it as well.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.638
Well, of course he has!

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.514
It's been quite a while

00:05:47.556 --> 00:05:49.808
since the last time
we were all together.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.228
Yeah. That's not quite
what I was getting at, Iris.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.437
[IRIS]
Hm?

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.690
Just forget about it.

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:57.732
[IRIS]
See ya!

00:05:57.774 --> 00:06:00.402
In the meantime, I'll try
to find some wild greens.

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:02.654
Sure. Thanks a bunch.

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.701
[IRIS]
Oh! <i>Fuki</i> buds.

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:12.914
[IRIS] Looks like some
angelica buds, too.

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:15.417
[IRIS giggles]

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.961
This'll be delicious.

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:20.380
[gasps] Oh, there's even more!

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:28.013
[IRIS]
Thanks for having me over.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.056
Dinner was delicious.

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:32.934
No problem. It was
really nothing special.

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:34.519
[THEO]
Come back anytime!

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:36.313
When you're already
cooking for three,

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.189
adding one person is easy.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:39.816
Thanks. I'd love to.

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:42.068
Theo. You don't get
to say something like that

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.695
unless you're the
one who cooked.

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:44.905
Calm down.

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:47.407
I was just bein' nice,
plus ya know I'm right.

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.284
Hey. Show some respect.

00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:51.828
[IRIS giggles]

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.705
But, you're welcome
to come back.

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.040
Great!

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.877
Um. I should walk Iris home.

00:06:58.919 --> 00:06:59.961
[THEO]
Bring back presents.

00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:00.795
[PHIOUS]
No chance.

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.047
[THEO]
Aw.

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:08.929
[PHIOUS]
Good grief.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.097
Theo's always energetic,
but when we have company,

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:12.599
he's downright annoying.

00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:15.060
[IRIS laughs]
He's a lively one,

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.020
but that just made our
night more entertaining.

00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:19.147
[PHIOUS] Well, I'm glad
you still had fun.

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:22.609
Your place is always fun.
Though, I hope I'm not imposing.

00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:24.152
You aren't at all.

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.905
My brother was right
that it's no extra work.

00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:29.115
And the wild greens
you bring are delicious.

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:31.618
They're just normal plants
that grow in the mountains.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.621
No. The ones you pick
for us are special.

00:07:34.663 --> 00:07:36.748
They taste better somehow.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:37.999
Do they really?

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:39.793
You'd think they'd taste the
same no matter who picked‐‐

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:40.627
No!

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:41.503
[IRIS]
Uh?

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.964
Uh‐‐ Um‐‐ I'm sorry.

00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:47.050
I‐I didn't mean to
shout at you, Iris.

00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:50.011
But still, I mean it.
Your greens taste great.

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:54.474
You think so, huh?
I'm glad to hear it.

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:57.435
Yeah. I love...

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:58.853
...your greens.

00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:04.567
[PHIOUS]
Strange.

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:08.655
To think that loving something
can turn it bitter.

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:13.576
[IRIS] I appreciate
your walking me home.

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:15.036
I should be fine from here.

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:18.206
Right. Come back anytime, Iris.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.294
[IRIS]
Hey, Phious!

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:25.755
[PHIOUS]
Huh?

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:28.466
What do I need to become
a worthy Queen of Light?

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.468
What makes a leader?

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.137
Huh...

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:34.973
[IRIS] Sorry, that was
weird. Forget I asked.

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:38.184
No. I may not have
a proper answer.

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:41.479
But the mere fact that you're
thinking this way is promising.

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:45.066
For knights,

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:50.905
the only question is
"how do I serve my queen?"

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:53.074
Thanks for that, Phious.

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:55.493
I'll figure it out for myself.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:57.328
I promise.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.330
I'll learn what makes a queen.

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.249
And how one should lead.

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:07.338
[IRIS]
What a nice breeze.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.423
It's strange.

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:10.508
If I become the next queen,

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.887
everything that's familiar
will change for me.

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:16.973
Even this view of the sky.

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:18.099
[gasps]

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:22.771
[gasps] I have to go
warn the knights!

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:28.693
[panting]

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.028
It's gonna catch me.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.572
There's no choice
except to fight!

00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:36.284
[IRIS] Please, Rune.
Lend me your power!

00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:40.371
[IRIS]
O' malevolent darkness, begone.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.874
Leave these skies
and never return!

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:00.809
It's gone.

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:06.606
[gasps] I... drove
the darkness back!

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:14.239
[VOICE 03A] The White Priestess
is light's final bastion.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.783
[IRIS]
This voice.

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:18.159
Are you...?

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:21.746
[VOICE 03A] She must face
profound loneliness

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:24.791
and stay strong despite it.

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:27.919
Lonely or not, I want this.

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:30.130
I choose this.

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.924
I'm prepared to stand
alone if I must.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:33.925
With the rune,

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:36.427
I'll preserve the balance
between Black and White.

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.888
Until the end of my reign.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.515
I swear.

00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:43.935
Even if all the souls in both
kingdoms turn against me,

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:46.104
I will stand firm.

Good.

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:04.706
You seem fully prepared
for any contest.

Are you not coming with me?

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.796
I shall be attending the king.

[PRINCE OF DARKNESS sighs]

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:15.133
You'll be all right.

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:17.302
You're the candidate
of the Skeers family.

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:20.180
That carries more weight
than you realize.

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:22.140
Have faith in yourself.

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:24.559
And in this.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.644
You've become a fine swordsman.

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:28.563
Take it from your teacher.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.066
I'll see you.

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:36.070
[sighs] Take care of yourself.

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:39.991
[GROZA] We've gathered
here today so the king's

aspiring successors
can be measured

00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:43.912
against each other and ranked.

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:46.706
Let me thank each
of you for coming.

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:48.499
Naturally, one of
you will emerge

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.085
above the rest: and they...

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:54.797

the Greatsword of Black!

[CONTESTANTS gasp]

00:11:57.383 --> 00:12:00.803
So whoever gets that greatsword
will be the heir apparent.

[BEASTMAN 03A]
All right.

So how's this
contest gonna work?

[GROZA]
To start,

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:11.397
you'll have to battle
those monsters.

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.650
Then, the top, or
remaining two contenders

00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:15.735
will face off in a duel.

if a few of us

end up with worse than bruises.

[GROZA]
That won't be an issue.

We're prepared to
render aid if needed.

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:30.667
And if you're feeling
averse to danger,

00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:33.419

to withdraw your candidacy.

Yeah!
