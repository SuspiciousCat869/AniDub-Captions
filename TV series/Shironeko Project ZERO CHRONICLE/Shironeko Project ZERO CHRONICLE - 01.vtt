00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.889
[IRIS]
In the beginning,

00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:18.268
when our beautiful kingdom first
came to float above the clouds,

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.064
a noble, white cat
sat upon the throne.

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:26.610
One day, a black cat looked up
from the mud of the surface,

00:00:26.652 --> 00:00:27.653
saw her,

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:28.987
and fell in love.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.509
[IRIS]
The sky is in anguish.

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.428
I must guard the rune.

00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:39.701
[MAN 1A]
There you are.

00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:41.453
How are you feelin'?
You ready to head out?

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:42.287
[BOY]
I am.

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.998
Good. I'm hopin' you'll bring
some beginner's luck with ya.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.874
I'm famished.

00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:48.126
So, let's go and bag
ourselves some meat.

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:56.677
[MAN 1B] Hmph. They live
carefree up there,

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:59.262
while we fight for
our lives in the mud.

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:01.056
What I wouldn't give
to switch places with 'em.

00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:02.891
[MAN 1C] There's a pack of
monsters heading this way!

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:04.267
‐‐[MAN 1B] What?
‐‐[MAN 1A] Damn it.

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:06.144
[MAN 1A]
They've finally come here, too.

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:10.107
You need to gather up
the children and run for it.

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:12.401
There's a cave in
the side of that hill.

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:13.735
You can hide there.

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:14.945
Okay. Understood.

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:16.822
Everyone else should
pick up a weapon.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.907
We don't have time
to be afraid now.

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:21.827
Ready?

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:23.870
You take care of them.

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:26.081
We'll let you know when
the town's safe again.

00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:26.998
Who knows.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.917
Maybe we can bring down
a big one for you.

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.669
[CHILREN laugh]

00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:31.795
They're here!

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:34.047
Get ready.

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:36.299
We'll protect our village
no matter the cost.

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:37.175
[VILLAGERS]
Right!

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:38.218
Now!

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:41.471
[MAN 1D screams]

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:42.681
[MAN 1B groans]

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.062
Oh!

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:51.314
[gasps] Are you hurt?

00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:54.109
Just a little.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:57.696
Can you move? We're close.

00:03:57.738 --> 00:03:59.156
[BOY 1A screams]

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:02.868
[gasps]

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:06.705
Let him go!

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.381
Keep going. The cave's up ahead!

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:17.507
[BOY 1B]
'Kay.

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.516
Watch out!

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:27.559
[gasps]

00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:33.023
Please go.

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:35.901
Take care of my sister for me.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:47.370
[panting]

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:49.748
[gasps]

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.636
[BOY]
Hello? Hello?

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:04.387
Is anyone still alive?

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.161
It can't be far now.

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:30.664
Here's hoping this
place has a tavern.

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.045
[SKEERS]
Pardon, boy.

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:40.090
I was told that there was
a village in this area.

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.052
It's gone now.

00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:45.387
Monster attack?

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:49.099
If the village is gone,
then what are you doing here?

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.684
[BOY]
Digging a hole.

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:51.935
[SKEERS]
A hole?

00:05:51.977 --> 00:05:53.979
[BOY]
Is that wrong?

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.564
[SKEERS]
What's it for?

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:59.401
[BOY]
It's for the people who died.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.321
So, what do you want?

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:05.240
Why haven't you gone for help?

00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:08.201
The monsters got the
neighboring villages, too.

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:12.747
Don't push yourself further.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.667
Keep this up, and you'll
die for nothing.

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:17.085
[BOY]
I don't plan to.

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:18.795
I get enough sleep.

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:21.882
What of food?

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:26.136
Take it.

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:33.685
[BOY]
Why give me this?

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:37.856
I don't have any motive.
Let's just call it a whim.

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:41.026
[coughing]

00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:47.824
[SKEERS] So tell me.
What name do you go by?

00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:49.618
I'm Skeers.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.369
[BOY]
Call me what you like.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.913
Everyone else did.

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:55.332
[SKEERS]
Hm.

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:56.917
I don't understand.

00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.460
Isn't the King of Darkness
supposed to be

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:00.629
ruling and protecting
these lands?

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.255
That's right.

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:05.508
[BOY] Then why does he let
these monsters run wild?

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.970
The king must be occupied
with concerns of his own.

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:09.930
Oh, yeah?

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:12.807
I wonder if he's concerned
with the right things.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:16.645
[SKEERS] What do you think
the "right things" would be?

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:19.648
The happiness of
the people he rules.

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:21.983
[SKEERS]
Heh. Superficial.

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:25.111
[BOY]
Yeah, well. I'm still digging.

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:27.948
How long do you
intend to do this?

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.451
[BOY]
Till the hole's deep enough.

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:33.995
And how deep should it be, boy?

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:37.499
[BOY]
Enough to reach the sky.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.752
[SKEERS]
Interesting. Please explain.

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:44.214
I don't expect you
to get this, but, well‐‐

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:45.507
[SKEERS]
What?

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:48.510
[BOY] Light can reach the
depths of the darkest pit.

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:52.514
And there, even a faint
light can shine bright.

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:55.141
That thought makes the
world feel kinder to me.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:56.643
More balanced.

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:01.856
Well said.

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:05.276
[BOY] Doesn't matter if
you're from land or sky.

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:07.946
We all end up
in a hole eventually.

00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:09.572
We're the same...

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:10.991
...in the end.

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:18.665
[SKEERS]
Pick it up.

00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:22.252
You'll need more than a shovel
to change this world for good.

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:28.550
Huh?

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:31.428
[SKEERS grunts]

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:35.223
[SKEERS grunts]

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:39.519
What's wrong? Are you
finished already?

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:42.105
I never asked you to do this.

00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:44.566
Maybe not. But still.

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:47.944
If you didn't want this,
then why pick up the sword?

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:51.364
[BOY]
I know what you're after.

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:54.200
You want me to get strong
enough to fight the monsters.

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:56.077
But I've got no chance.

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:57.996
[SKEERS]
I said nothing of the sort.

00:08:58.038 --> 00:08:58.997
[BOY grunts]

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:01.332
Die. Better than wasting
your useless life

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:04.210
wallowing in despair
and cursing the world.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:09.591
Huh?

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:11.217
[BOY]
What are you playing at?

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:14.137
If you think I deserve to die
then why hold back?

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:17.307
[SKEERS]
Call it a whim.

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:18.808
This is life and death.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.935
You can't make that
choice on a whim!

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:24.814
Yet I do.

00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:26.900
You don't have the
right: no one does!

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:30.028
And what if I say you're wrong?

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.571
That right exists.

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:34.199
The power to kill or save
at will belongs to someone

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.409
you could never
even hope to meet.

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:37.786
That's the truth.

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:40.121
But what good will
knowing it do you?

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:42.999
Is it enough to make
you submit to his rule?

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:44.417
You mean the King of Darkness?

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:45.502
I do.

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:49.005
The people of Black are destined
to obey the King of Darkness.

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:51.466
Yeah, but you're not
the king of anything!

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:53.927
[SKEERS]
You're right.

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:56.721
I am no one's king.

00:09:56.763 --> 00:10:01.684
I'm a fool who tried to
become king, but wasn't chosen.

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:03.144
What's wrong?

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:04.896
Don't tell me you're
so weak a person

00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:08.733
that you can be killed
at an old man's whim.

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.986
What are you trying
to prove here?

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.029
Damn it.

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:17.408
[grunts]

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.327
Listen to me.

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:22.205
You've a strong ideal
to push you forward.

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.749
But the people's happiness
is no easy goal.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.709
You'll need more than
half‐hearted resolve

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:27.836
to achieve it.

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:30.046
Don't you think I know that?

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:31.798
Then what'll you do?

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.800
Wait for help to
fall from the sky

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:36.136
or dig another hole to nowhere?

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:42.600
It's time you came
to your senses.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:45.937
You've an ideal to fight for
and you are now honor‐bound

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:50.358
to take that ideal and
transform it into reality.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.403
[BOY]
Fine. I'll do it!

00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:56.906
I'll become the next king!
I'll do whatever it takes!

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:13.339
[SKEERS chuckles]

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:16.551
[laughs]

00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:18.261
What is it?

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:19.637
I'm glad, is all.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:20.889
[BOY]
Glad for what?

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.390
For you.

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:25.268
For the miracle
I found in the end.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.270
[BOY]
This isn't over yet, all right?

00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:31.441
It is for me, actually.
Won't be long now.

00:11:31.482 --> 00:11:33.359
Are you hurt? What's wrong?

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:36.487
[SKEERS] I fought the
current King of Darkness

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.114
over the succession.

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:40.742
"What's wrong" is that I'm old.

00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:44.913
My sword.

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:47.624
Take it with you and
make for the capital.

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:49.167
I've a mansion there.

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:52.212
I hail from a noble family,
and the bearer of that blade

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:55.173
is considered its head.

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:57.759
So, go. Bring the sword.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.220
And declare yourself with pride.

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:03.473
Announce that you are
a Prince of Darkness.

00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:05.975
You'll encounter a knight
known as Vallus.

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:07.894
He's a good, loyal man.

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:09.938
Let him see what you
can do with a sword

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:12.315
and I'm sure he'll
look after you.

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:16.444
Earn his recognition, and
he'll serve you faithfully.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:18.613
[BOY]
I never said I'd go.

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:22.325
You're a stubborn young man.
Just like me in my youth.

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:26.412
You're saying that I'm like you?
Heh. You've gotta be kidding.

00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:29.374
[SKEERS] You'll need to
polish up your language.

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:32.877
I've felt it, too, by the way.

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:36.631
I've wondered if
a body could rest.

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:41.469
Not just in darkness, but in
light, as well, however faint.

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:44.973
[BOY]
Wait. Skeers.

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:48.434
Are you really... dying?

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:51.938
[SKEERS] I've been a husk
of a man for some time now.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:56.776
My link to the Power of
Darkness has been severed.

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:58.361
We both see it.

00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:01.322
The world is far from
what it should be.

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:03.157
When you ascend to the throne,

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:05.243
make it better.

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:06.452
Yeah.

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:16.045
He was born in darkness.
So how can he shine?

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:19.590
Is this... light coming from me?

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:23.261
I'm counting on you.

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:28.099
All right. I'll go.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.812
[BOY]
I'll declare myself successor

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:36.399
to the King of Darkness,
just like you've asked.

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:40.945
After that, I'll be
able to do it, right?

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:44.866
To help everyone in this
world find happiness.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.129
Progenitor Rune. Obey my will!

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:04.719
Calida, Lux, Puram, Lucem!
Banish the darkness. Shine!

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:15.855
[gasps] What?

00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:22.570
[gasps] There are still so many.

00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:24.072
Prepare yourselves.

00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:26.115
The Knights of Light
fear no enemy!

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:27.075
Trust in the Queen!

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:28.409
Sir Phious!

00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:31.621
The Rune's protection
is with us!

00:14:31.662 --> 00:14:35.249
Don't let the beasts of darkness
sully the Kingdom of White!

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:39.462
Support them!

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:41.506
[MAGES]
Right!

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:44.801
[SHEAMA] Rune that none may
command but the White Priestess.

00:14:44.842 --> 00:14:48.179
I beseech you to lend us a
fraction of your great power.

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:51.015
Light. Form a
shield against evil!

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:54.936
[KNIGHTS OF LIGHT yelling]

00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:57.438
[PHIOUS yells]

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.023
Thanks for the help, Sheama!

00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:02.527
We have the advantage.
Finish them!

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.821
[KNIGHTS OF LIGHT yell]

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:07.657
[IRIS]
As I thought.

00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:09.534
The darkness is growing.

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:12.537
If this keeps up,
the balance will tip.

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:21.379
[gasps] Her Majesty's returning.

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.965
[SUBJECT 1A] Seems she drove
back the darkness again.

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:38.896
Ah!

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:41.899
[THEO]
Hey. Phious!

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.443
[PHIOUS]
Hello there, Theo.

00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:46.362
[SHEAMA]
Well done today.

00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:49.699
We need to be ready for the next
attack so rest while you can.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.452
If anything happens,
I'll inform you at once.

00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:53.494
[MAGES]
Ma'am.

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:55.705
May the Rune's
light protect you.

00:15:58.207 --> 00:16:00.877
Welcome back, Sheama.

00:16:00.918 --> 00:16:02.378
Thank you, Theo.

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:05.673
[THEO]
So how did the battle go?

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:07.258
Did you get hurt?

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.052
I'm Commander of the Knights
of Light for a reason.

00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:12.221
And it's not because
I'm an easy target.

00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:13.973
That's my brother!

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:15.308
Glory hog.

00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:17.977
Give your sister's
support magic some credit.

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:19.479
[PHIOUS]
Support magic?

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.646
I didn't notice any.

00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:21.481
[SHEAMA]
Oh, yeah?

00:16:21.522 --> 00:16:23.065
That's odd, because
I seem to remember

00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:24.859
someone yelling
"Thanks, Sheama."

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:27.236
[PHIOUS laughs]
I'm joking.

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:29.155
Yeah, well you're no comedian.

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:32.366
And you knights aren't
fighting all alone.

00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:34.076
We mages are there with you.

00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:36.996
Risking our lives
just as you do.

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:40.249
That's true. Of both
you and Her Majesty.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.546
[SHEAMA] You know, with the
power of the Progenitor Rune.

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:47.632
It's possible that
the Queen could defeat

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.675
the Darkness for good.

00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:53.054
But she can't afford to
expend all its power, right?

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:56.516
Interesting. You
receive the Rune's

00:16:56.557 --> 00:17:00.102
protection through your
tiara, don't you, Sheama?

00:17:00.144 --> 00:17:02.230
[SHEAMA]
I do.

00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:05.775
But still. I can't
help but wonder.

00:17:05.816 --> 00:17:09.153
She knows that light and dark
are meant to stay balanced.

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:11.197
Could that be causing
her to hesitate?

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:12.281
[PHIOUS]
No!

00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:15.409
The Queen is determined to
vanquish the King of Darkness.

00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:17.370
I hope that's the case.

00:17:17.411 --> 00:17:19.997
[PHIOUS] Keep these thoughts
between us, Sheama.

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:23.042
I know enough to take your
words with a grain of salt.

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:24.919
But others won't.

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:27.088
I understand, Phious.

00:17:27.129 --> 00:17:29.465
Remember. I'm the
kingdom's Court Mage

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:31.467
and a commander, too.

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:40.017
[AIDE 1A]
How are you feeling?

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:44.647
I don't mean to pry,
but you seem distracted.

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:46.983
You didn't use too much power?

00:17:47.024 --> 00:17:48.317
I'm fine.

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:50.611
You've no cause to worry.

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:52.321
We prevailed yet again.

00:17:52.363 --> 00:17:54.031
With difficulty.

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:56.742
Just how many times
have we done this now?

00:17:56.784 --> 00:17:59.287
We may be outpaced before long.

00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:02.373
So then, the Black...

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:04.083
Darkness waxes.

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:06.168
As does the strength
of its ruler.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.921
Embodiment of instinct
that he is.

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:13.593
Eventually, he'll be
more than I can match.

00:18:13.634 --> 00:18:14.802
[AIDE 1A]
Oh.

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:17.513
[IRIS] I'm sorry, but we need
to put even more resources

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.682
into military preparation.

00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:21.309
[AIDE 1A]
Yes, My Queen.

00:18:27.898 --> 00:18:30.192
You there. That's a fine sword.

00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:32.194
Where'd you acquire it?

00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:35.531
Do you actually need
me to tell you that?

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:37.033
I've been told
that Skeers' mansion

00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:39.869
is somewhere in the city.
Do you know where it is?

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.955
[growls] You actually expect
my help, you brazen thief?

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:44.915
[yells]

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:47.335
[VALLUS] I demand that you
return my lord's pride!

00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:48.586
[grunts]

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:53.007
Tell me this.
Is your name Vallus?

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:54.675
[gasps] That it is.

00:18:54.717 --> 00:18:56.385
But how did you know that?

00:18:56.427 --> 00:18:58.471
And what has happened
to Lord Skeers?

00:18:58.512 --> 00:18:59.930
He's dead.

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:03.267
Was it by your hand?

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:10.983
[VALLUS]
No. A novice as pathetic as you

00:19:11.025 --> 00:19:15.279
wouldn't stand
a chance against him.

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:17.740
What have you come here for?

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:20.451
I've glimpsed an ideal
that's worth fighting for.

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:22.912
Which means I have a duty
to myself and the world

00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:24.747
to strive to bring
it to reality.

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:27.041
[gasps]

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:29.669
If you start from down there,
you'll have to crawl.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.712
[BOY]
I'm determined. Not proud.

00:19:31.754 --> 00:19:32.922
[VALLUS gasps]

00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:34.882
[BOY]
I am a Prince of Darkness,

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:37.718
successor to the
King of Darkness!

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:42.181
You've convinced me.

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:45.518
I shall acknowledge
you as my lord.

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:47.895
I'll guide you to
the mansion at once.

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:49.397
Come.

00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:59.365
[IRIS]
Progenitor Rune.

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:01.826
Grant us your protection.

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:03.577
When I see you like this,

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:05.538
I feel like your,
"White Priestess" title

00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:07.790
fits you better than
"Queen of Light."

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:08.874
[gasps]

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:10.126
[SHEAMA]
You're up rather late.

00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:12.086
Having trouble sleeping,
Your Majesty?

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:14.922
[IRIS] There's no need
to stand on ceremony.

00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:16.257
I may be the Queen of Light,

00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:19.135
but I still think of you
as an older sister, Sheama.

00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:21.220
We've been together a long time.

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:24.598
Seems like only yesterday
we both aspired to the throne.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.558
[SHEAMA]
We did.

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:27.143
And now you're Queen.

00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:28.853
I... didn't mean‐‐

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:30.938
It's fine. I'm not
bitter about it.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.898
You couldn't help but win.

00:20:34.608 --> 00:20:36.318
[SHEAMA]
Say, do you remember her?

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.153
[IRIS]
Who?

00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:39.905
[SHEAMA]
The previous Queen of Light.

00:20:39.947 --> 00:20:41.198
[IRIS]
I don't.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.616
It's strange, isn't it?

00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:44.827
I remember that
someone preceded you.

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:48.456
But I can't recall anything
about who she was.

00:20:48.497 --> 00:20:50.040
Or, no.

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:52.334
I remember one thing, actually.

00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:55.337
She always had a peaceful
look on her face.

00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:58.883
I have at least some
idea of why that is.

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:01.719
The Queen's duty is
to maintain balance.

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:06.098
You don't do that by acting
rashly or accumulating power.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.726
Did you learn that from
the Progenitor Rune?

00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:10.311
[IRIS]
I suppose I did.

00:21:10.352 --> 00:21:12.021
That works in theory.

00:21:12.062 --> 00:21:15.733
But darkness is determined
to tip the scales right now.

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:17.067
What are they after?

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:19.653
Do they want to take
the Rune for themselves?

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:21.947
[IRIS] No. At least,
most of them don't.

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:24.700
The Kingdom of Black's
people are just like ours.

00:21:24.742 --> 00:21:26.243
But their king
is out of control,

00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:28.954
and now he's dragging
them all to ruin.

00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:31.123
[SHEAMA]
It's a shame.

00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:33.626
I'm sure that, under the
next King of Darkness,

00:21:33.667 --> 00:21:37.087
the balance between our
realms will be restored.

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:40.299
[SHEAMA] But you may have
been forgotten by then.

00:21:40.341 --> 00:21:41.884
Our people might
not even remember

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:43.761
that you fought for them.

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:47.264
How you repelled the darkness,
time and time again.

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:48.766
I don't mind that.

00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:51.727
As long as the future's
peaceful, it's fine.

00:21:51.769 --> 00:21:54.146
Wow. You're so perfect.

00:21:54.188 --> 00:21:55.606
I am not.

00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:57.107
[SCOUT 1A]
Your Majesty.

00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:58.609
[IRIS]
What is it?

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:00.903
[SCOUT 1A] The western
capital is under attack.

00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:01.862
It's Bahl.

00:22:01.904 --> 00:22:03.823
[gasps] Not him.

00:22:03.864 --> 00:22:05.324
Your Majesty!

00:22:05.366 --> 00:22:06.992
We'll head that way at once.

00:22:07.034 --> 00:22:08.035
Go, Sheama!

00:22:08.077 --> 00:22:09.787
You and Phious ready the troops!

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:10.830
[SHEAMA]
Right!
