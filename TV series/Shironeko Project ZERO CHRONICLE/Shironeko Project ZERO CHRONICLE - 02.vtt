WEBVTT

00:00:11.887 --> 00:00:13.889
[SKEERS]
Pardon, boy.

00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:15.724
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
I'll become the next king.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.559
I'l do whatever it takes.

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:19.394
[SKEERS] How long do
you intend to do this?

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.271
[PHIOUS] The Rune's
protection is with us!

00:00:21.313 --> 00:00:22.481
[IRIS]
I don't mind that.

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:24.733
As long as the future's
peaceful, it's fine.

00:00:24.775 --> 00:00:27.319
[SHEAMA] You know, with the
power of the Progenitor Rune,

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:29.363
It's possible that
the queen could defeat

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:30.614
the Darkness for good.

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:32.533
[SKEERS]
You've an ideal to fight for.

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:34.868
And you are now honor‐bound
to take that ideal

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.454
and transform it into reality!

00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:39.164
[IRIS]
We prevailed yet again.

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:40.832
With difficulty.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.418
Just how many times
have we done this now?

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.797
Eventually, he'll be
more than I can match

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:47.965
[SKEERS] I'm counting on you.

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.467
[IRIS] I'm sure that, under the
next King of Darkness,

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:53.136
the balance between our
realms will be restored.

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:54.972
I am a Prince of Darkness.

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:56.974
Successor to the
King of Darkness!

00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:50.629
Move out! Support the queen!

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:51.713
[KNIGHTS]
Sir!

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:55.884
[SHEAMA]
Mages.

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:57.636
A threat has appeared in Metis,

00:02:57.678 --> 00:02:59.221
the western capital.

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:01.765
We shall defend it
alongside the knights.

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:14.403
[CITIZENS screaming]

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:15.946
[SOLDIER 02A]
This way!

00:03:17.114 --> 00:03:21.118
[BAHL cackles]
Isn't there anyone up here

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.953
who can put up a fight?

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:31.878
[MAGES]
The rune protects.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.296
Trust in its power.

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:37.259
[BAHL] So the city's brave
defenders are hiding in a tower.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.427
[MAGES grunt]

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:43.056
[cackles]

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:45.684
Stay calm. We mustn't
succumb to fear.

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:46.810
[MAGES]
Right.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:51.898
[BAHL]
Now it's my turn.

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:58.613
[gasps]

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:06.705
Now, fire!

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:14.379
[BAHL chuckles] Making
yourselves easier to find, eh?

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:15.881
Well then...

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.844
[BAHL]
Allow me to offer my thanks.

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:26.892
[ALANTIA]
Bahl!

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:30.687
I won't let you defile
this land further!

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.397
[COMMANDER 02A]
Lord Alantia!

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.857
[ALANTIA]
We'll handle this.

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.610
Focus on evacuating the people.

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:37.819
[COMMANDER 02A]
Right.

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:42.949
[BAHL]
Alantia, leader of the elves.

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.452
Maybe you can
keep me entertained.

00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:46.620
Go!

00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:57.130
[SCOUT 02A]
Knight Commander!

00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:58.882
There are soldiers
of darkness ahead.

00:04:58.924 --> 00:04:59.758
Truly?

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.344
And here I thought we'd
sent them all running.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.888
First troop with me.
We'll scout ahead.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.848
Second troop,
stay with the mages.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.769
Don't let the soldiers of
darkness get anywhere near them.

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:13.605
Sheama. I'll be counting on you.

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:16.608
Right. We're with you.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.276
[PHIOUS]
They won't get past us.

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:19.402
Let's go!

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:38.129
[BAHL cackles]
Try not to disappoint me, elf.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:39.464
Attack.

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:48.598
[BAHL]
Ah. A cage of lightning.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.350
Very clever.

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:02.070
[BAHL]
You're not half bad. But...

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:07.075
Spirits. Fall back
at once! Move!

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:32.475
[BAHL] Huh. A winged ant
is still an ant.

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:36.104
It can't be. How is
he this strong?

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:41.985
[ALANTIA]
I've lost. There's no hope.

00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:49.200
[gasps]

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.420
[MAGE 02A]
Queen Iris!

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:04.090
May the rune guide you,
and... protect you.

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:05.675
Be careful...

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.889
[ALANTIA]
Queen Iris! Be careful!

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:13.850
He's stronger than
we anticipated.

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:15.769
I'm grateful, Alantia.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.897
Thanks to your brave efforts,
many civilians escaped.

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:21.024
You bought us all time.

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:23.735
[BAHL laughs] I was
wondering when you would

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.403
deign to make an appearance.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:26.446
Begone.

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:28.865
I shall suffer your
presence here no longer.

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:31.493
Leave or be slain, Bahl!

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:35.872
[BAHL] Hah! If you think you can
slay me, then come and try.

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:46.841
[BAHL]
My. You're swift.

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:48.218
[yells]

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:59.896
Tch. Timing your attack
to match Bahl's.

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:01.231
Devious fiends!

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:03.608
Wait. No. We aren't
here to fight.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.736
We're deserters.
We surrender. Just arrest us.

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:08.405
So, you yield?

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:11.074
Drop your blades
and kneel. Do it now!

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:15.996
[PHIOUS]
Ugh. Shameful.

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:18.581
Don't you have any
pride as warriors?

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:21.042
[HUMAN SOLDIER 02B] Of course
not! We're not warriors.

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:22.961
We're just a bunch of
peasants who got conscripted

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:26.297
to fight a war
we don't understand.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.508
Please, sir.
I'm telling the truth.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.676
You have to‐‐

[BOTH gag]

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:34.014
What's this?

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:39.019
[growling]

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:42.063
[yells]

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:52.115
Showing your true
colors, eh? Attack!

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:54.159
They lack the
numbers to beat us!

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:02.333
[IRIS]
Progenitor Rune, obey my will!

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:06.171
Calid, Lux, Puram, Lucem!

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:07.881
Banish the darkness!

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.394
He has such a brutal,
malevolent power.

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:23.354
How can I best him?

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:24.606
If this continues‐‐

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:27.233
[BAHL] Don't just float there
talking to yourself.

00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:29.569
Come give me a show.

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:30.904

Dea Preces!

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:38.286
[BAHL laughs]
That's the spirit.

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:42.707
[yells]

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:47.170
[BAHL laughs] I'd expect no less
from the Queen of Light.

[IRIS grunts]

00:09:57.806 --> 00:09:59.307
[BAHL]
I actually felt that.

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:01.184
But just barely.

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:04.813
[IRIS]
I can't win.

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:08.733
Not without using more
of the Rune's power!

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.402
Progenitor Rune. Obey my will!

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:15.698

Your Majesty.

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:21.913
Remember, we have to
conserve the rune's power.

[gasps]

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.461
[BAHL]
Oh, such hubris.

00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:30.922
You think you can beat me
without giving your all?

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:34.384
The rune's already strained.
I can't keep pushing it.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.096
[gasps, grunts]

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:42.475

How disappointing.

He's leaving?

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:03.538
[ALANTIA]
Queen Iris?

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.290
[IRIS]
Go aid the survivors.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:08.001
Commander Phious
will be here shortly.

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:10.795
[ALANTIA]
As you wish, Your Majesty.

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:28.813
[SHEAMA]
It's an awful sight.

Sheama.

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:33.401
Sorry. We were
intercepted on our march.

[gasps]

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.237
[SHEAMA]
It was infantry.

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:38.573
My brother and his
knights defeated them.

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:41.117
I think they were human.

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:42.827
[IRIS]
I see.

[MONSTER COMMANDER 02A]
Dark Knight Vallus.

00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:07.310
When will His Majesty return?

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:08.686
[VALLUS]
Why do you ask?

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:10.355
[MONSTER COMMANDER 02A]
There's a matter that requires

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:11.272
his attention.

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:12.732
What's that?

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:14.817
[MONSTER COMMANDER 02A] Our last
invasion force was comprised

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:18.655
of only my followers and
it was utterly decimated.

00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:20.949
It's gone too far! I'm done!

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.701
We fight battle after
battle and gain nothing!

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:26.037
The people of Black
aren't a horde of savages

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.705
who live only to kill.

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:30.041
Well, Sir Vallus. What say you?

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:41.552

groans, screams]

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:48.268

[VALLUS]
I am at your disposal.

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.356
You needn't dirty your hands,

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:55.525
unless it should
please you, of course.

00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:58.194
[MONSTER SOLDIER 02A]
H‐How could you?

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.908
[KING OF DARKNESS chuckles]

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:09.706
[VALLUS]
My king.

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:13.209
[KING OF DARKNESS]
The sun. The stars.

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:14.669
The sky.

00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:17.714
All will be reclaimed
by darkness in time.

00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:20.508
The faint rays of light which
steal through the cracks

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.845
in oblivion's grasp,
are but passing phantoms.

00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:26.306
Snuff them out for good.

00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:28.474
I submit to your authority.

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:29.642
That said,

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:32.645
we are losing soldiers
at an alarming rate.

00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:34.230
[KING OF DARKNESS]
The people of Black are bound

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:36.941
to obey the will of darkness.

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:40.653
Yes, it's as Your Majesty says.

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:42.405
[KING OF DARKNESS]
White in the sky.

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:45.116
And Black on the earth.

00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:48.619
[KING OF DARKNESS]
Balance be damned.

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:51.080
Harmony be damned.

00:13:51.122 --> 00:13:54.208
We will have rest when
our victory is complete.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:58.296
When darkness has
blotted out all things.

00:13:58.338 --> 00:13:59.964
Soon, we shall
bring the kingdom

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:02.467
of sky‐dwellers crashing down.

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:06.637
But at present, something else
commands my attention.

00:14:12.393 --> 00:14:15.355
[VALLUS]
The World's Egoism: Bahl.

00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:17.315
[KING OF DARKNESS]
That's right.

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:22.737
This kingdom no longer has
need of a future generation.

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:27.700
But my would‐be successors can
still make themselves useful.

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:37.293
Hey Vallus. How ya doin'?

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:38.795
Just fine.

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:42.006
I was at the royal
palace with the King.

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:43.132
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Why?

00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:45.301
Because I am bound
to his service.

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:46.719
It is my duty to serve him

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:49.430
as well as his
potential successors.

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:52.725
My loyalty is divided,
but absolute.

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:56.354
Is that really how it works?

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:58.022
Well, whatever.

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:00.441
Vallus. Teach me how to fight.

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:02.151
If I wanna become the next king,

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:05.029
then I'll need to be your
match with a blade.

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:08.574
[VALLUS] Skill with
a blade will be needed.

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:11.244
But a king should
also be well read.

00:15:11.285 --> 00:15:14.288
You can start your
studies with these.

00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:17.708
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
I have to read all that?

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.669
A good king does
not simply rule.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:20.711
He governs.

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:22.755
He has the acumen to
administrate his kingdom.

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:26.134
To build up cities and
cultivate his fields.

00:15:26.175 --> 00:15:27.385
Does that make sense?

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:30.012
Or is your intention to
let the people starve?

00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:31.597
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS sighs]
Of course not.

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:33.182
‐‐But I wanna get strong‐‐
‐‐[VALLUS] Also...

00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:36.477
A king must command respect
from the people he leads.

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.438
His words need to carry weight.

00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:39.981
Which means you need
to make adjustments

00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:41.774
to the way you speak.

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:45.236
Lord Skeers basically
told me the same thing.

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:47.989
We'll begin your lessons
in swordplay tomorrow.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:51.325
For real?

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:53.578
[clears throat]
I would like that.

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:55.746
Thank you.

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:57.623
There are others just like you.

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:59.876
Would‐be heirs to the throne.

00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:02.962
One of my many duties is to
instruct the kingdom's soldiers

00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:05.756
in the way of the sword,
so naturally,

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:08.968
I train aspiring
successors, too.

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:32.867
[yells]

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.747
[VALLUS]
Hm.

00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:39.123
That was just a fluke.

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:40.541
One more.

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:45.796
[VALLUS] You've worked
diligently since arriving here.

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:47.673
There's no doubt that
you've progressed.

00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:50.968
I try, but I'm nowhere
near your level.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.179
I think we should
step up my training.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.141
My Lord. If you would.

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:58.434
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Hm?

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:04.190
[VALLUS] Lord Skeers wore this
when he was around your age.

00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:05.650
What do you think?

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:07.985
Something tells me
it'll fit you well.

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.111
For me?

00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:12.156
Yes. I think if Lord
Skeers were here,

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:14.867
he would be delighted
to see you make use of it.

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:32.843
Lady Groza?

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:34.345
I'm getting tired.

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:35.930
Okay, at ease for now!

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:37.306
We're taking a quick break.

00:17:37.348 --> 00:17:38.724
‐‐[SOLDIER C, SOLDIER B] Right.
‐‐[SOLDIER A] Uh, right.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.273
[GROZA]
Honestly.

00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:48.109
Why do I have to come way out
to the middle of nowhere?

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.319
Uh. Excellent question, Ma'am.

00:17:50.361 --> 00:17:51.904
This is so annoying!

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:53.823
What kind of potential
successor to the throne

00:17:53.864 --> 00:17:56.701
would even come here? There's
nothing around but rocks.

00:17:56.742 --> 00:18:00.037
Whoever they are, there's no way
they're actually gonna win.

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:01.455
[SOLDIER B]
Uh, maybe you shouldn't

00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:03.374
say that so loud, ma'am.

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:05.042
Just who do you think's
gonna hear me?

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:07.878
There's nothing out here!

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.673
[COMMANDER 02B]
Hm? Lady Groza.

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:13.968
Please get back.
Monsters are coming!

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.429
[GROZA laughs] I'm not
scared of a few monsters

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:20.016
that forgot who their
master is. Stupid beasts.

00:18:20.057 --> 00:18:22.643
I'll remind them with my magic.

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:29.609
[GROZA]
Burn to ashes!

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.194
Révolte Éclair!

00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:38.409
[BOTH]
Whoa!

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:41.829
[SOLDIER A]
Amazing!

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:44.248
That's the Gray‐Green
Demoness for you!

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.042
[SOLDIER B]
Well done, Princess of Black!

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:48.252
[SOLDIER C]
Impressive work, Lady Groza.

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:49.670
It was no big deal.

00:18:49.712 --> 00:18:51.881
Strays like those
are easy to kill.

00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:56.093
Look out!

00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:58.679
[GROZA]
There's no time. I can't dodge.

00:19:09.273 --> 00:19:10.733
Are you all right, miss?

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:12.943
Oh, uh. Yeah.

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:18.658
Thank you for saving me.

00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:19.992
Of course.

00:19:23.746 --> 00:19:25.581
[gasps]

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:28.542
Hey. Hold on!

00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:32.380
So... who might you be?

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:36.092
Someone who hopes
to become king someday.

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:39.303
The King of Darkness?

00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:40.262
In that case,

00:19:40.304 --> 00:19:42.515
what are you doing out
in the middle of nowhere?

00:19:42.556 --> 00:19:44.350
This is all just
wasteland. Right?

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:47.395
Why go so far from the kingdom?

00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:49.063
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
It's not actually that far.

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:49.980
[GROZA]
Huh?

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:51.982
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Vallus showed me this place.

00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:53.901
We come here to work
on my swordsmanship.

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:56.570
Ah! Really? Okay. Sure.

00:19:56.612 --> 00:19:59.573
It's really just a pleasant
stroll to the kingdom, yeah.

00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:01.117
Why aren't you guys
saying anything?

00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:01.951
[COMMANDER 02B]
Huh?

00:20:01.992 --> 00:20:02.993
I'm off.

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:04.537
Glad to see you're okay.

00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:05.579
Bye.

00:20:07.498 --> 00:20:08.749
[gasps]

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:18.843
[GROZA]
The Prince...

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:20.469
...of Darkness.

00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:23.597
Hey, Lady Groza.

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:24.932
Lady Groza!

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:26.225
You need to stop him.

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:28.394
We can't just let him leave.

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:30.020
Say something.

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:31.313
Lady Groza!

00:20:32.356 --> 00:20:35.526
Shut up, will ya?!
I'm working on it.

00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:37.403
Sir! Please wait.

00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:42.491
We came here in the
hopes of finding you.

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:47.288
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Is that so?

00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:49.582
Yes. I'm officially inviting you

00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:52.668
to compete with
the other candidates.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.003
Sounds good to me.

00:20:54.044 --> 00:20:56.630
Yeah? That's wonderful to hear.

00:20:56.672 --> 00:20:59.300
Great. In the event you become
the number one candidate

00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:01.010
for succession,
you'll be rewarded

00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:02.845
with the Greatsword of Black.

00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:05.890
Once its yours, you'll be
officially recognized

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:08.267
as the true Prince of Darkness.

00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:11.937
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Oh.

00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:14.940
You prefer the sword you have?

00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:17.276
Is it special to you
for some reason?

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.708
[ADEL]
Huh. The Greatsword of Black.

00:23:03.591 --> 00:23:06.677
[IRIS] So the infantry
you faced were human?

00:23:06.719 --> 00:23:09.805
Yes. They acted
strangely at one point,

00:23:09.847 --> 00:23:11.599
but we cut them all down.

00:23:13.726 --> 00:23:15.936
Good. As Knights of Light,

00:23:15.978 --> 00:23:18.939
you're sworn to strike down
all who disturb the balance.

00:23:18.981 --> 00:23:21.275
You performed your
duty admirably.

00:23:21.317 --> 00:23:23.444
[PHIOUS]
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.744
[IRIS]
Perhaps I was wrong,

00:23:31.785 --> 00:23:34.914
and the people of Black
aren't like us after all.
