[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
In the beginning,

00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:15.098
when that beautiful kingdom

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.809
first came to float
above the clouds,

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:21.313
a noble, white cat
sat upon the throne.

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:23.815
One day, a black cat looked up

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:27.361
from the mud of
the surface, saw her,

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:29.238
and fell in love.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.950
[HUMAN SOLDIER 11A]
This way, Your Highness.

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:34.243
Thank you.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.916
[DARK ARMY yelling]

00:01:04.648 --> 00:01:05.774
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS gasps]

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.654
It's you.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.993
Why aren't you glad to see me?

00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:18.412
Ya feelin' guilty
about choppin' me up?

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:23.166
Heh. I actually considered
you an ally back then.

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:25.877
I did feel like
that went too easily.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.713
You got me in the back.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:31.216
Still, it takes more than that
to kill an heir to the throne.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:37.264
And also, I've got way more
monster in me than say, you.

00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:38.432
Right?

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:46.440
What were you thinking, Adel?

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:47.774
Huh?

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:53.614
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS] Why did
you attack the Queen of Light?

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:55.699
'Cause it was
His Majesty's wish.

00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:58.452
And therefore the will
of the Kingdom of Black.

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:00.412
Just who do you think you are?

00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:03.206
I should be asking you
why you stopped me.

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.960
[ADEL]
Although, to be honest,

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:09.504
it's probably for
the best that you did.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:10.839
What?

00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:12.883
The Queen of Light has power.

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:16.011
But at heart,
she's just a little girl.

00:02:16.053 --> 00:02:18.013
The shock from what
she saw is filling her

00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:19.931
with doubt as we speak.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.601
Soon she'll be no threat at all.

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:26.104
See, when two people of
equal strength go at it,

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.982
the victor is whoever
doesn't give in.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:32.736
So that was part of
the king's strategy, too.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:39.201
Everybody underestimates
His Majesty's intellect.

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:40.952
But the instinct
to grow and expand

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:44.414
is what gave rise to
intelligence in the first place.

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:47.501
You're all fools for
thinking the king's a brute.

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:48.960
I see what this is.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.838
The king sent you here to
get me out of the way, right?!

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:02.057
Why are you saying that like you
uncovered some kind of secret?

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.850
You sweet idiot.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.771
Well, hey, it's fine.

00:03:07.813 --> 00:03:09.648
If the Dark Knight
couldn't see this coming,

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.400
then what chance did you have?

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.527
Wait, do you mean Vallus?

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:16.154
I understand the way
that His Majesty thinks,

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.573
'cause I'm swimming in darkness.

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:19.991
You know, I think it
might've been the king

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:22.202
who brought me into this world.

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:29.167
But none of that
actually matters now.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.670
The king wanted you
and Groza out of the way

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:35.090
because he could tell that
you might get in bed with White.

00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:36.675
In bed?

00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:39.302
[ADEL] I'm talking in terms
of your allegiance, idiot.

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:42.639
Nobody cares about your
twisted, little love triangle.

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:46.059
[ADEL] Oh, and don't
get the wrong idea.

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:48.437
Compared to the King of
Darkness at full strength,

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:50.605
you're nothing but an insect.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.274
You pose no threat to him.

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:55.861
But he's wise enough to keep
his guard up despite the fact.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:04:00.615
[ADEL]
Enough talking. Come at me!

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:02.909
Thought we settled
this in our first fight!

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:05.871
This isn't the way
things have to be, Adel!

[PRINCE OF DARKNESS grunts]

00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:16.381
[chuckles] Is that
all you've got?

[PRINCE OF DARKNESS grunts]

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:25.432
Or are you still not
taking me seriously?

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:03.530
You didn't actually think that
would finish me off, did you?

foolish than I thought.

Beating me changes nothing.

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:30.951
I bet the king
planned for this, too.

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:32.577
Wait, what?

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:34.663
[ADEL]
I wasn't sent here to beat you.

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:37.207
I was sent to slow you down.

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:38.959
[gasps]

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:43.421
[ADEL] Most of our forces are in
the sky, as is the king himself.

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.382
How long do you think
the Kingdom of White's

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:47.676
wavering light will hold out?

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.260
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS growls]

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:52.806
That's right. What hope
they had is fading fast.

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:55.725
Once the king absorbs
the Progenitor Rune,

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:58.144
darkness will cover all space,

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:01.481
and the balance will
collapse for good.

00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:04.234
Once that happens,
this world is done for.

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:06.820
There won't be so much
as a single survivor.

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:09.906
Everyone from both of
our kingdoms will die.

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:11.449
What do you mean?

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.827
I know that his goal
is to conquer White.

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:15.036
But isn't that because he thinks

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:17.497
he'll have peace
once his kingdom wins?!

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:19.874
If you can't see what
"peaceful darkness everywhere"

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:22.210
really means, then
the King was right

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:23.753
to not consider you a threat.

00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:26.965
So both kingdoms will fall?

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:30.051
But that would mean he
wants to destroy everything.

00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:32.887
Then what does that make
the people who serve him?!

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.224
Why would you fight for that?!

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:38.226
He doesn't have the
right to take our future!

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:39.394
No one does!

00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:43.189
Know what? I think I'll
go ahead and lead the way...

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:45.567
...into peaceful darkness.

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:57.495
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS] So that's
why the king left me down here.

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.581
Away from the light.

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:19.517

must be a way up there.

yourself out of my reach.

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:31.334
It should've been me!

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.758
[SHEAMA gasps]

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.889
Are you feeling okay?
Can you hear me?

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:49.060
[SHEAMA]
Y‐Yes. What happened?

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:52.188
You were swallowed by darkness.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.775
[SHEAMA]
I see. Heh.

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:56.985
[BOTH gasp]

00:12:57.026 --> 00:13:00.446
Well, I guess their king
isn't so tough after all.

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:04.867
I'm just a mage, but for all his
efforts, he couldn't corrupt me.

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:06.953
[MAGE 12B]
That's our leader!

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:08.663
How's Queen Iris doing?

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:10.373
She's safe for now.

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:13.042
All right then, this
battle isn't over yet.

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:15.336
We have a horde
of monsters to fight.

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:18.381
We'll keep the people safe
no matter what it takes.

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:19.257
[BOTH]
Right.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:27.515
[IRIS]
O Progenitor Rune.

00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:34.772
Hard as I fought, I couldn't
protect the Kingdom of White.

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:36.858
I didn't have the strength.

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:39.736
And now the
balance is in tatters.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.116
[IRIS]
I guess this makes me a liar.

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:47.118
I said I'd wait for you,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.621
so we could build a
peaceful world together.

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:53.041
And I really wish we could have.

00:13:56.794 --> 00:13:59.547
Now that every hope
we had has failed us,

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:02.008
there's only one option left.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.969
One chance to stop the darkness.

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:09.849
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS yells]

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:12.477
I won't let anything
slow me down!

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:16.481
[gasps]

00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:21.569
Hold on! I'm coming for you!

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:26.491
[MYSTERIOUS VOICE 03A]
No! This is wrong!

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:29.410
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Yeah. This is wrong.

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:32.538
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
I can't explain why,

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.539
but deep in my being

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:36.584
I can feel that things
got twisted around!

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:37.794
But how?

00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:39.670
Where did we go wrong?!

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:42.256
If right and wrong were
never set in stone,

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.967
then what are the
laws of this world for?

00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:48.346
Before it's all lost,
I wanna find out!

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:52.850
[MYSTERIOUS VOICE 03A] If you
wish it, the world can change.

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:54.977
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
I don't have any answers,

00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:56.437
but‐‐

00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:57.438
[MYSTERIOUS VOICE 03A]
You weren't born

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.857
just to feel sorrow.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:03.569
You two didn't meet just so
you could miss each other.

00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:08.908
If I'm ignorant, then of course
I want to look for the truth!

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.618
[MYSTERIOUS VOICE 03A]
I'll help you.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.371
I don't wanna hurt you,
so move aside!

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:20.503
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS] Evil.
What does that word even mean?

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:24.424
If I can't answer that, then
how can I trust my convictions?

00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:27.385
How do I know my ideals
aren't just selfish?!

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:31.931
Faster! You don't
have time for doubts!

00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:36.018
The age of my kingdom
will now come to an end.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.396
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
I have to reach her!

00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:41.149
That said, the world's
balance will be maintained.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.818
If I can't help her now,
then what good was my promise?!

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.070
Because I know
that I shouldn't exist,

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:48.406
I'm going to
commit an awful sin.

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:49.365
I'll protect you!

00:15:49.407 --> 00:15:53.035
O Progenitor Rune,
great bastion of light.

00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:54.662
Iris!

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:58.374
Bring forth all that is
concealed within your facets,

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.376
and unleash it.

00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:02.003
The king‐‐

00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:04.338
seal him away!

00:16:09.343 --> 00:16:12.513
[VALLUS, PHIOUS grunting]

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:14.348
What could be causing
this earthquake?

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.892
[PHIOUS yells]

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:20.730
Damn. So stubborn.

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:25.276
[VALLUS grunts]

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:29.489
Run, you coward.

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.366
My battle's won,
but she's still fighting.

00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:34.327
Please wait for me, my queen.

00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:39.332
[PHIOUS] What's this?
The Progenitor Rune's shining.

00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:41.417
Wait! The light's too strong!

00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:42.877
Don't tell me‐‐

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:45.171
[gasps] It's self‐destructing?

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:47.590
But the people
of White are still‐‐

00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:48.591
Hey, Sheama!

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:51.260
[SHEAMA grunts]
What are you doing here?

00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:54.305
This is hopeless.
We have to run.

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:55.556
I can't.

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:56.807
You could.

00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:59.852
But fine; I'll go on my own.

00:16:59.894 --> 00:17:01.187
I'll keep running forever,

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:03.814
even if there's
no one else left!

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:07.485
[THEO] They'll never catch me.
They won't get the chance!

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:09.445
[yelps]

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:24.752
I held the gate.
I sent the foe running.

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:25.711
So why?

00:17:25.753 --> 00:17:29.715
Why would you give up
instead of waiting for me?!

00:17:29.757 --> 00:17:31.884
[gasps]

00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:34.512
[groans]

00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:42.895
No! Why?!

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.859
[KING OF DARKNESS]
What's this?

00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:52.965
[gasps] Iris!

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.384
[IRIS gasps]

00:18:57.803 --> 00:19:00.431
[IRIS]
Oh no...

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:03.267
My prince, I'm sorry.

00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:07.521
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS grunts]

00:19:08.939 --> 00:19:12.276
I gave my word,
but I couldn't keep it.

00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:17.031
Wait, Iris, no!

00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:32.254
[IRIS gasps]

00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:51.482
[rumbling]

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:53.442
No, don't tell me‐‐

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:01.951
The queen... Could she have...?

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:24.098
[KING OF DARKNESS] I see. She
sacrificed her entire kingdom,

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.727
so she could attack me
with the Rune's full power,

00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:31.814
[KING OF DARKNESS]
What?!

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:34.275
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS growls]

00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:41.615
[KING OF DARKNESS groans]
Insolent fool!

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:45.161
Let's go down together.

00:20:45.202 --> 00:20:46.996
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
She's gone.

00:20:47.037 --> 00:20:48.956
But this was her wish.

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:55.629
Just disappear!

00:20:57.631 --> 00:21:01.969
[KING OF DARKNESS]
Curse you!

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.390
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Goodbye, Iris.

00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:31.619
Iris, why didn't
you wait for me?

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:35.623
It feels... so bitter.

00:23:38.459 --> 00:23:43.422
[cackling]

00:23:47.384 --> 00:23:53.432
