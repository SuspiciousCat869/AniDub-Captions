[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
No. It can't be.

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:22.439
[MERCHANT 04A] Step right
up and feast your eyes.

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:24.733
Forget about the
final battle with White!

00:00:24.775 --> 00:00:26.401
If ya wanna stay
alive afterwards,

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:27.986
you're gonna need to eat.

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:30.739
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
The "final battle." So then‐‐

00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:33.784
Hey there. What
can I offer ya? Wait.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:36.954
Shouldn't you be with
the army right now?

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:39.206
First I find out that
they left Lady Groza behind,

00:00:39.248 --> 00:00:41.583
and now I learn that
they did the same to you.

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:44.044
But why? You turn
against the king or what?

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:47.506
Uh, no. It's nothing like that.

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:51.134
Well, then again...

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:53.053
That isn't exactly reassuring!

00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:53.887
Oh, but, uh...

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.931
if Your Highness
does take the throne,

00:00:55.973 --> 00:00:58.684
do me a favor and
lower taxes, okay?

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.852
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS chuckles]
I'll keep it in mind.

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.437
[GIRL 11A]
Hi, Your Highness!

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:03.939
Nice to meet you!

00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:06.066
Hi. Same to you.

00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:08.902
[BOY 11A]
Hey. Are we gonna win the war?

00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:10.612
[GIRL 11A]
Mom was telling us about it!

00:01:10.654 --> 00:01:14.283
She said that kingdom makes
it hard to dry laundry!

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:17.035
I bet she'd love
to see it go away.

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:19.162
[BOY 11A]
Make sure we win, okay?

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:21.957
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Yeah. I'm sure that we will.

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:23.709
[DARKNESS SOLDIER 11A]
Your Highness!

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.794
May I have a moment
of your time, please?

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:28.922
These soldiers
are kind of scary.

00:01:28.964 --> 00:01:30.257
Want a piece of me?

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.425
[DARKNESS SOLDIER 11A]
I do not.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.094
My business is
with His Highness.

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:36.138
Now then, would
you accompany me?

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.931
For what reason?

00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:39.766
[DARKNESS SOLDIER 11A]
I'm to bring you to the castle.

00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:41.852
That's all I know.

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:44.896
Why are the king's
soldiers acting so menacing?

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:49.359
I couldn't say. Sorry kids.
I need to go with them.

00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:51.320
[BOTH]
Aw...

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:52.821
[MERCHANT 04A]
Take care.

00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:55.073
Thank you. Let's go.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.825
[DARKNESS SOLDIER 11A]
Forgive me, my prince.

00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:59.620
Now! Take His Highness away!

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.915
Is he gonna be okay?

[GROZA gasps]

00:03:52.858 --> 00:03:53.942
[PHIOUS]
Theo,

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:55.944
it's possible that our
next battle with Darkness

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:57.946
could engulf the whole kingdom.

00:03:57.988 --> 00:03:59.781
If that should happen, then‐‐

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:00.866
I'll run!

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.159
Run where?

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.160
[THEO]
To the sea.

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:04.828
How exactly?

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.831
[THEO] I know it's far,
but I'll use magic.

00:04:07.873 --> 00:04:10.000
Let's save that
for a last resort.

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:12.627
I would rather you
just hide somewhere safe.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:16.840
[THEO grunts] Hide somewhere
safe? And where's that gonna be?

00:04:16.882 --> 00:04:18.008
[PHIOUS, SHEAMA gasp]

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.553
[THEO] Just kidding. Don't
worry about me. I'll be fine.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.098
You're a good kid.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.767
If the fight goes bad,

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:28.852
then you'd better
run away, too, okay?

00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:31.104
I'll fight until
the enemy flees.

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.690
Yeah, but, Phious,
if they do the same thing,

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:35.692
you'll be fighting forever.

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:38.779
When the battle's
lost, just run.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.781
You keep getting smarter.

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:42.657
[THEO]
Sorry. It'll be fine.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.119
Our kingdom will win,
right? How could we not?

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:50.081
We're strong because we have
Queen Iris: the White Priestess.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:53.251
[PHIOUS]
Yes. So have faith.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:57.088
As long as we believe in her,
our kingdom will never lose!

‐‐[SHEAMA] Right.
‐‐[THEO] Mm!

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.177
[PHIOUS]
I believe in you, Iris.

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:05.347
[PHIOUS]
And I swear

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:09.309
that as long as I have even
a spark of life left in me,

I'll protect you.

bring peace to this world.

You have my word.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.578

afford to be flitting

00:11:15.466 --> 00:11:17.802
I think you might
be a worthy opponent.

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.346
May I request a bout?

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:21.264
[PHIOUS]
Heh.

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:24.559
I doubt you'll be so eager to
duel once you know who I am.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.645
I am Phious, commander
of the Knights of Light.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:30.899
I am the queen's shield
and also her sword.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.067
And I will never let you pass!

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:35.111
Hah. Well said.

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.614
But if you actually want me
to remember that name,

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:40.617
you'll need to make an
impression with your sword!

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:41.868
If you insist!

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:47.123
Blaze of Darkness! Rise up
and burn through the light.

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:48.958
[yells]

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.668
[yells]

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.837
[PHIOUS grunts]

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:57.050
[KING OF DARKNESS]
I can't recall

00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:59.052
how many times we've fought.

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.970
Do you think you can best me?

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:03.389
I can surely say
I've done it before.

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.183
Every time we fight,
you retreat!

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.560
[KING OF DARKNESS]
Don't be so shortsighted.

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:09.562
I am not like light

00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:13.942
which thins as it spreads
till at last it disappears.

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.485
I am darkness.

00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:19.822
And darkness is ever‐expanding.
Don't you understand?

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:23.868
It's inevitable that my power
should grow as yours fades.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.453
[IRIS]
Is that so?

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:28.539
[KING OF DARKNESS] Yes.
My predecessors were constrained

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.708
by the system of succession.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.210
But I reject it.

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:33.753
I shall defy the cycle

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:36.923
and become the one and
only King of Darkness.

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:39.717
My power shall wax
for all eternity.

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:43.846
My kingdom shall conquer every
light. Snuff out every star.

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:46.724
All will fade to black!

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.685
An eternal darkness?

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:52.146
[IRIS]
I won't allow it!

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:54.899
You've rebelled against the
founding laws of this world,

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:58.152
and for that, I'll destroy you!

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:19.048
The Cage of Affection!

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:22.176
There's too much darkness.
We can't hold it back!

00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:29.350
[MAGES groan]

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:30.852
Uh‐‐

00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:31.602
[MAGE 11C gasps]

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:33.896
[KNIGHT 11E groans]

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:36.107
[MAGE 11C]
No. What do we do?

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:38.568
We keep fighting.
Become manifest!

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:42.113
One of the seven great
powers: Flow of Light!

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:44.157
Bathe them in light!

00:13:46.075 --> 00:13:46.909
[GROUP gasps]

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:49.704
Wow. You saved
them, Lady Sheama!

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:53.124
[SHEAMA gasps]

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:55.001
There's no way.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.007
[SHEAMA]
No. Why? I can't dispel it!

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.845
Progenitor Rune, please!

00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:07.513
This is our hour of need!

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:11.267
If you won't give us your power
now, then what hope do we have?

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:16.230
[grunts]

00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:23.905
Every swing of your sword
is laughably predictable.

00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:27.742
Then why haven't you won?
Perhaps you're just that weak!

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:34.207
Where does your power come from?

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:39.545
[PHIOUS]
My faith in the queen I serve!

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:41.464
[VALLUS]
Then just like her...

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.719
...you'll soon be defeated.

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:48.429
And why's that?

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:50.264
[VALLUS]
Devotion to an individual

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:52.433
is like a heat‐induced mirage.

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:54.769
Once shaken,
it's easily dispelled.

00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:56.813
[PHIOUS]
That's a difference of opinion.

00:14:56.854 --> 00:15:00.691
Blind subservience to a title
invites your master's ruin.

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:05.113
I'm not loyal to a throne,
but to a person I believe in.

00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:08.658
And so my feelings
give me strength!

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:11.869
[VALLUS]
Hmm. There's a term for this:

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:14.789
Self‐indulgent drivel!

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:19.502
What did you say?!

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:21.712
[VALLUS] I'm saying
that it's apparent now

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:24.799
what makes your people so weak.

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:27.927
You have fertile lands,
peace loving citizens,

00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:29.429
a benevolent sovereign,

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.973
and the finest
of armaments, too.

00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:34.434
[VALLUS]
And yet you'll fall.

00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:37.311
Why? Because it made you soft!

00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:39.313
[PHIOUS grunts]

00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:41.441
I will remember you, Phious,

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:44.527
for your weakness,
your vainglorious folly,

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:45.903
and for the fact
that your strength

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.989
was never tempered by pain!

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:52.785
[PHIOUS grunts]
You boast of your misfortune?!

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:58.291
[yells]

00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:05.089
Hallowed words,

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:06.966
become keys to
the power of light

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:09.969
and unleash the might
of the Primordial Rune!

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:14.891
Calida, Lux, Puram, Lucem!

00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:18.102
[KING OF DARKNESS]
This is futile.

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:19.645
Boast all you want.

00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:22.940
With the strength of the rune,
I can erase you from this world!

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:25.860
[KING OF DARKNESS] You're
monopolizing the rune's power.

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:28.279
Do you know what that
means for your people?

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:30.448
Without the rune's
light to protect them

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.867
they'll be enslaved
by my shadows

00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:35.411
or butchered by my thralls.

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:37.163
[IRIS]
I won't fall for your goading.

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:38.748
If the balance
remains disturbed,

00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:40.750
that will happen
eventually anyway!

00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:42.210
If it means slaying you,

00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:44.837
I will sacrifice
everything I have.

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:46.923
[KING OF DARKNESS]
Including your people.

00:16:46.964 --> 00:16:49.717
We're more alike than I thought.

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:51.761
[grunts] I am nothing like you!

00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:53.179
[KING OF DARKNESS]
Oh, but you are.

00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:54.180
[IRIS]
No!

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:55.556
[KING OF DARKNESS]
You will be hated.

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:57.808
[IRIS] That may be true,
but I don't care!

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.523
[IRIS] I will do what it
takes to restore the balance.

00:17:03.564 --> 00:17:06.442
It's the only way
to preserve the future!

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:09.529
[KING OF DARKNESS]
How naive.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:13.574
You would balance the scales
whereas I would overturn them.

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:16.452
It's obvious who will succeed.

00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:18.746
[IRIS]
Still...

00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:20.831
...I'll fight!

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:22.917
[KING OF DARKNESS grunts]

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:24.835
[KING OF DARKNESS]
Bahl also accused me of boasting

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:26.462
and now burns in my prison.

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:29.006
Those who attempt
the impossible fail.

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:33.636
It's time you learned!
This is the way of the world!

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:35.221
[IRIS groans]

00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:49.735
Um, what should we do?

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:51.320
Become manifest.

00:17:51.362 --> 00:17:55.449
One of the seven great powers:
Light of Affection.

00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:57.785
Heal our wounded comrades.

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:04.375
[SHEAMA grunts]

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:10.172
Why go dark? Why now?

00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:13.301
Why has the rune
abandoned us? Why?!

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.140
[SHEAMA] Your light was supposed
to be infinite, right?!

00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:21.058
If it's not, then
what good are you?!

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.477
Just shine, you stupid rock!

00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:27.106
[MAGE 02A]
It's hopeless.

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:32.612
Not yet. Keep up the fight.

00:18:32.653 --> 00:18:34.155
We are not helpless.

00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:35.531
We won't quit.

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:37.408
So what if our
magic isn't working?

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.869
We still have our fists, right?

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:47.209
Well spoken.

00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:49.462
Iris, you're here!

00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:52.131
I heard what you shouted.
You're quite a leader.

00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:54.550
I'd expect no less.

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:57.219
Hold on. What about the rune?

00:18:57.261 --> 00:18:59.180
It's light faded.

00:19:00.222 --> 00:19:01.849
Remember your lessons.

00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:03.809
Think. There's still a chance.

00:19:03.851 --> 00:19:06.520
Right. One of the seven
powers can still help.

00:19:06.562 --> 00:19:08.689
We'll use the gears of fate.

00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:11.484
[IRIS] We must give it all
the strength we have left.

00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:14.153
Form up, mages. One last spell.

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:15.905
[MAGES]
Ma'am.

00:19:15.946 --> 00:19:18.616
[SHEAMA]
We're all that's left.

00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:22.119
Concentrate, Iris!
We can't divide our focus.

00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:25.498
[IRIS]
Right.

00:19:25.539 --> 00:19:27.667
[IRIS]
One of the seven great powers:

00:19:27.708 --> 00:19:29.919
The mighty Gears of Fate.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.755
I beseech you to change
your machinations.

00:19:34.465 --> 00:19:38.511
Show me the path to the truth
that I'm destined to know!

00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:15.005
[gasps]

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:20.302
[SHEAMA] I don't get it.
Did anything actually change?

00:20:21.512 --> 00:20:24.765
[SHEAMA] Is there really
no way out of this?

00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:26.559
[IRIS]
Our promise.

00:20:27.685 --> 00:20:31.021
[SHEAMA]
Hey, Iris.

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:33.023
Talk to me, Iris.

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:36.068
[KING OF DARKNESS cackles]

00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:39.071
[KING OF DARKNESS]
Thought you'd twist fate?

00:20:39.113 --> 00:20:40.364
A wasted effort.

00:20:40.406 --> 00:20:44.160
The history I've plotted runs
too deep to be uprooted now.

00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:47.747
No. That can't be.

00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:49.290
I have no choice.

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:52.418
[gasps] Wait, is
there still a way?

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.379
Is there still something
you can do to fight back?

00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:56.714
[IRIS]
Yes, but‐‐

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:57.673
[SHEAMA]
Then go.

00:20:57.715 --> 00:20:59.008
[IRIS gasps]

00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:02.094
[SHEAMA] There's no time
for second‐guessing.

00:21:02.136 --> 00:21:03.721
Do your duty as our queen.

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:06.974
I'll sacrifice everything
I have, even my life!

00:21:07.016 --> 00:21:07.933
Make it count.

00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:08.768
[IRIS gasps]

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:11.520
Now hurry up and go!

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:19.320
[IRIS]
Sheama, thank you.

00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:20.404
[KING OF DARKNESS]
It's unsightly

00:21:20.446 --> 00:21:22.823
the way you struggle even now.

00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:24.074
Accept your‐‐

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:26.285
You sure like to
hear yourself talk.

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:28.704
[KING OF DARKNESS]
Hm. Intriguing.

00:21:28.746 --> 00:21:30.039
[gasps]

00:21:35.044 --> 00:21:40.382
[screaming]

00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:42.384
[MAGES]
Lady Sheama!

00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:46.806
[KING OF DARKNESS chuckles]
It seems I've given in

00:21:46.847 --> 00:21:49.016
to one of my vices...

00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:51.018
"Playfulness."

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:57.191
[KING OF DARKNESS cackles]

00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:07.660
[IRIS]
Help me... Please.
