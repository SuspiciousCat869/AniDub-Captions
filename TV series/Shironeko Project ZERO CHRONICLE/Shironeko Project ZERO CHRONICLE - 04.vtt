Quick question, bro.

00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:53.637
[SOLDIER B]
What is it, bro?

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.764
[SOLDIER A]
What are we doing right now?

00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:57.724
[SOLDIER C]
Isn't it obvious? We're rowing!

00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.017
[SOLDIER A]
Through the sky?

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.602
[SOLDIER B]
What's it matter where we are?

00:01:00.644 --> 00:01:02.896
[SOLDIER A]
It's just... there's no water.

00:01:02.938 --> 00:01:05.148
[SOLDIER C]
Woo‐hoo! Just look at us go!

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.359
[SOLDIER A] I can't even
tell if we're moving.

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:10.320
[SOLDIER C] Ooh! There's
a floating continent.

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:12.197
[SOLDIER A]
Where? We don't have windows!

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:15.450
[SOLDIER C] I heard a rumor,
and we might have a problem.

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:16.285
[SOLDIER A]
What is it?

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:19.162
[SOLDIER C] Well, apparently,
this ship is powered by magic.

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:21.039
[SOLDIER A]
Huh? Magic?

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.791
[SOLDIER B]
Wait, what does that make us?

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:24.501
Just what have we
been rowing for?

00:01:24.543 --> 00:01:27.045
[SOLDIER C]
Nothing! That's the problem!

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:29.339
Well, then why don't
we all just stop, huh?

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:32.050

The three of you are

00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:43.937
[SOLDIERS]
Sir!

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.772
Uh, what exactly
were you men doing?

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:47.357
You made an awful racket.

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.235
[SOLDIER A] Oh. We were just
playing make‐believe, sir!

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:52.571
[COMMANDER 02B]
I see‐‐ What?!

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:55.240
You're on‐duty soldiers,
not children!

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:57.618
I'm docking all three
of your rations!

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.119
[SOLDIERS]
Aw.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.019
We're really here.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.397
[GROZA] Please be
cautious, Your Highness.

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.566
As an envoy, you should be safe.

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:56.778
But you must remember that
our countries are at war.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.531
[ADEL] You don't quite strike me
as the silver‐tongued type.

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:01.408
Are you sure you can do this?

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.953
I should be able
to deliver a letter.

00:04:04.995 --> 00:04:08.206
Ha! Do you really think
it's gonna be that simple?

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:09.708
Like Lady Groza just said,

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.086
Black and White are
in the middle of a war.

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:15.505
It's possible that
we won't make it back.

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.007
And if things go south,

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:19.426
it'll be the envoy's head
they cut off first.

00:04:19.468 --> 00:04:20.719
Adel!

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:22.888
[laughs] I'm not
trying to scare you.

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.056
I'm suggesting that
we be cautious.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.518
Up here, let's keep
your identity a secret.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.728
[gasps]

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:34.232
I'll play the diplomat,
and you play my guard.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.734
[GROZA]
Why go that far?

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:37.486
'Cause he's gonna be our king.

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:38.987
Fact is, we can't have him

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.740
sticking his neck
out needlessly.

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:43.033
You mean that?

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:44.659
[ADEL]
Looks like we're about to dock.

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:47.287
Ya ready to get booed
at by strangers?

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.648
You must be from Black.

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:17.317
I thought as much. Damn you.

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:20.237
[ADEL] My bodyguard
means only to protect me.

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:25.325
Forgive his brashness.
We wish you no harm.

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:27.285
[PHIOUS]
I take it you're the envoy.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:30.956
You were told to expect us.
That is the case, right?

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.374
The letter.

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:36.545
[ADEL] This is from
our sovereign to yours.

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:40.257
You.

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:42.092
Retrieve the letter from them.

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:46.680
We aren't a threat.
So lower your weapon.

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.640
I'll decide who isn't a threat.

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:50.934
I can understand
your position here.

00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:53.770
But I am not your foe.
I'm a humble messenger.

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:56.106
And I don't believe
you have the authority

00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:58.400
to turn me back at this point.

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:01.653
[PHIOUS] You turned violent and
I was forced to cut you down.

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.781
None would doubt my word.

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:06.825
You would lie to your queen?

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:09.828
[PHIOUS] It is a knight's
duty to guard the queen

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.746
from any threat.

00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:16.626
You really shouldn't let
your rage control you.

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:19.504
[PHIOUS]
What did you say?

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:22.048
Nevermind. Just
talking to myself.

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:29.222
This war should end.
It serves no purpose.

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:30.473
Are we agreed?

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:32.684
[PHIOUS] You're the ones
who've been on the attack.

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:37.063
[sighs] That's because
our king is deranged.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:42.944
[ADEL] And yet, no one
can defy his will.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:44.613
We're far too weak.

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.157
Our land has no Progenitor Rune.

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:50.035
The King of Darkness himself
is our equivalent.

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:58.793
[ADEL] It's not something the
average citizen worries about.

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.338
Our ruler decides
their fates on a whim.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.591
They think that's just
the way this world works.

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:06.301
Get to the point.

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:08.720
As a civil servant of
the Kingdom of Black,

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:11.097
I want to see peace restored.

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.815
If that's how you feel,
then maybe you should

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:22.442
take it up with your countrymen.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:24.778
If I tried to, I'd get this.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.530
[PHIOUS] So you serve
a madman out of fear.

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:29.491
That's what's wrong
with your country.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:32.327
I quite agree,
this is no way to live.

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:35.497
I would like nothing more
than to crown a new king.

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:37.207
Oh?

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:39.668
The king's forbears
weren't like this.

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.420
I won't pretend to know
what went on in their heads,

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.338
but from what I've heard,

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.049
they used to stay on
the ground, at least.

00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:48.843
[PHIOUS]
I've heard the same.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.804
I'd say that confirms it.

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:54.391
Though, Black's history
remains largely mysterious.

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:58.603
[ADEL] Our king will be
succeeded eventually.

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:00.438
We just need to outlast him.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.898
And when that day comes,

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.942
my hope is that we'll have
laid out the groundwork

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:05.819
for a lasting peace.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:10.949
[PHIOUS]
I don't care. I'm just a knight.

00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:11.992
[ADEL]
Really?

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.159
[PHIOUS]
What?

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:14.786
[ADEL]
Isn't it part of a vassal's duty

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:17.330
to guide his liege
in the right direction?

00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:18.999
[PHIOUS] Seems odd that
you invite me to do

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.001
what you can't do yourself.

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:24.212
[ADEL] The difference is
that you might succeed.

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:27.549
Heh. Fair. Your name?

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.176
Adel.

00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:36.266
I'll defer your
execution for now.

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:40.145
You seem unusually reasonable...
for a subject of Black.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:43.773
Believe it or not, there
are many just like me.

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:47.652
Give your weapons to my knights.
I'll handle the formalities.

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:02.208
Well, Your Majesty?

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:05.503
[PHIOUS]
I'll show them in.

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:38.703
[BOYS laughing]

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:42.540
[BOY 04C]
Hey! Those are demons!

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.918
[MOTHER 04A]
Ssh! Don't look at them!

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.006
It sounds like they've got
some prejudice up here.

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:52.133
I guess reforming the way
that people think'll be

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:56.346
an important goal on the
surface and in the sky.

00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:58.389
What are you two
muttering about?

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.725
You're a diplomat.
Have some manners.

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.602
Ah. Whoops! Sorry 'bout that.

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:05.480
You seem to have forgotten
how to speak formally.

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:08.650
So when do you plan to leave?

00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:11.820
If negotiations go smoothly,
I could leave today.

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:14.489
At least, I'd like to say that.

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:17.158
Realistically, it'll take
at least a few days

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.701
to iron out the details.

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:20.620
[PHIOUS]
You'll be none too welcome.

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:23.873
[ADEL]
Yes. I'm keenly aware of that.

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:25.625
[PHIOUS]
Perhaps the barracks, then.

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:27.544
So I might keep an eye on you.

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:28.795
I have to ask.

00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:32.674
Are you permitted to meet
envoys at your discretion?

00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:34.884
I'd have to get the
queen's permission.

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:42.058
I have brought the messenger
from the Kingdom of Black.

00:10:51.734 --> 00:10:53.444
The queen will meet you here.

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:54.737
[ADEL]
Right.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.027
Thank you for waiting.

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.670
I've come here from
the Kingdom of Black.

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:55.215
I am known as Adel Batinder.

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:57.008
I'm a poor substitute
for my king,

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.344
but I'll strive
to be of service.

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:07.727
[sighs]

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:13.983
Well met, sir. I have read
your king's message.

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:16.694
At present, relations
between our two kingdoms

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:20.073
are just about as
hostile as they can be.

00:12:20.114 --> 00:12:21.783
Before today, it seemed
that this war would

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:24.535
likely end with one of
our kingdoms destroyed.

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.579
[ADEL]
Your Majesty speaks truly.

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:28.748
Yet you would seek our aid?

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.960
[ADEL] The enemy of my enemy
may not always be my friend.

00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:35.380
But we could share
a united front.

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:36.756
It's true.

00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:39.175
There is one who ravages
my land for no reason

00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:41.261
but to satisfy his whim.

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:46.057
Bahl does the same
in our country.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:47.892
I sympathize.

00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:51.020
However, your king simply
wants the incarnation

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:53.564
of destruction out of
the way so he can focus

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.858
his aggression on my country.

00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:05.493
That's only true
for the current king.

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:06.452
Right.

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:08.746
His Majesty is considering
abdicating the throne

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:10.248
in the near future.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.293
He's reigned for a significant
number of years, already.

00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:15.753
The Kingdom of Black wishes
to establish and maintain

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.922
a permanent balance with
the Kingdom of White.

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:19.674
[AIDE 01A]
Excuse me, young man.

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:23.011
But are you speaking for
the king himself in this?

00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:24.095
Yes.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:27.432
[AIDE 01A] That strikes
me as contradictory.

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:30.643
I can repeat the king's words
but I can't explain his mind.

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:32.562
So, forgive me.

00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:35.898
I will. But I don't believe you.

00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:39.485
The choice is yours.
What will you do,

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:40.987
Queen of Light?

00:13:55.209 --> 00:13:57.837
I need time.
We will speak again.

00:14:11.225 --> 00:14:13.478
[SOLDIER A]
So, do you think the envoys

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:16.272
made it to the palace safely?

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:17.815
[SOLDIER B] I thought they
were gonna get cut down

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:19.776
for a minute there.

00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:22.779
I'm sure everything'll
work out. That Adel guy?

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.031
He's one smooth talker.

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:27.075
What's wrong with you three?

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:29.035
[sighs]

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:30.870
Does the fact that you're
all on duty right now

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:31.871
mean nothing to you?

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:34.040
[SOLDIER A] Sir! Permission to
make a request, please!

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:34.874
Go on.

00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:36.751
[SOLDIER A]
Please give me a name, sir!

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:38.836
[SOLDIER B] Actually, I was
gonna ask the same thing!

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.130
[SOLDIER C] Yeah, I'm worried
that otherwise we might

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:44.175
be unnecessarily difficult
to distinguish, sir.

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.510
Why's that?

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:48.388
I can tell you three apart
just by looking at your faces.

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:50.765
We can see how that might
be good enough for you.

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:52.600
But are you everybody, sir? No!

00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:54.185
There are lots of folks
who aren't you!

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:55.770
[COMMANDER 02B]
Well, that's true, but...

00:14:55.853 --> 00:14:57.730
You could at least
give us nicknames!

00:14:57.772 --> 00:14:59.273
All right, I'll do it!

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:00.983
I can tell that you'll
keep hounding me

00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:02.819
for all eternity if I don't.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.778
[SOLDIER A]
All eternity?

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:04.987
[SOLDIER C]
People don't live that long.

00:15:05.029 --> 00:15:06.239
[SOLDIER B]
Think before you speak, sir.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.867
Hush! Shut up so I can decide
what to call you morons.

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:11.494
[GROUP]
Hooray!

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:12.412
[COMMANDER 02B]
You're, ah, Achibe!

00:15:12.453 --> 00:15:13.246
Sir!

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:14.956
[COMMANDER 02B]
You're B... B... Bakase!

00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:16.165
Sir!

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.042
Is that really the best
you could come up with?

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:18.876
[COMMANDER 02B]
Quiet!

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:20.378
And you're Cee... chan.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.504
That sounds like a kid's name.

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:22.922
[COMMANDER 02B]
Ugh. Stop your whining!

00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:25.216
It's either that or
Chancee, take your pick.

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:27.343
Hey! You just named
us A, B, and C!

00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:29.220
What if they shorten
my name to "Baka"?

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:31.305
I don't feel like
"Ceechan" really captures

00:15:31.347 --> 00:15:32.348
my raw masculinity.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.851
No complaining! You begged
me for these names.

00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:36.477
Ya can't give 'em back now.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.064
[GROZA] You certainly
seem to be having fun!

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:41.607
It must be nice
to go through life

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:43.276
without a care in the world.

00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:44.152
[GROUP]
Ma'am!

00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:46.154
[GROZA]
No! Don't you "ma'am" me!

00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:47.405
[GROUP]
Ma'am?

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:49.824
Get cleaning!

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:52.618
I want this ship sparkling from
stem to stern, understand?

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.621
And don't even look at me
until you've finished!

00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:00.084
[GROUP]
Ma'am...

00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:07.800
[DARKNESS SOLDIER 04A] Lady
Groza! Sir Vallus needs you.

00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:15.349
[MERCHANT 04A] Step right up
and take a look at my wares!

00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:17.602
Worn down by hard times?

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:19.687
Well, I've got just
the stuff for you!

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:22.940
I've got food to fill your belly
and drink to dull the pain!

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:25.568
Cheap as you can
find it! But good!

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.862
Hey! Pretty lady, why
don't you come look at‐‐

00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:29.322
[DARKNESS SOLDIER 04B]
Ssh!

00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:31.741
[MERCHANT 04A]
Isn't she...?

00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:33.618
[DARKNESS SOLDIER 04B]
That's Lady Groza.

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:36.871
Oh. Yeah, that's her!
She's as beautiful as ever!

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:38.289
[DARKNESS SOLDIER 04B]
Of course she is.

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:40.458
But her ladyship isn't
just good looking.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.919
She has power to match.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.170
[MERCHANT 04A]
I bet they called her here

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:45.922
to help deal
with the monster.

00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:48.341
[DARKNESS SOLDIER 04B]
What? Who told you that?

00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:50.092
Did you think it was a secret?

00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:52.178
Everyone knows that
something's on its way.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.471
[DARKNESS SOLDIER 04B]
Stop.

00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:56.349
I'm gonna pretend I didn't
hear you say that, all right?

00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:05.483
Your Highness, be safe up there.

00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:29.882
You'll stay in here.

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:31.884
Technically, you're
the queen's guests.

00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:35.096
Wait, what? Why
only technically?

00:17:35.137 --> 00:17:38.057
Because your country
constantly invades mine.

00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:39.725
Fair enough.

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:41.602
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Um. Sir Phious?

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:42.728
Go on.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.690
I wonder. Could you
tell me what Iris is like?

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:47.233
Mind your manners.

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:51.821
You have no right to refer
to her so familiarly.

00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:54.865
Do you hope to find a way
to influence her choice?

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:58.327
No. I was just curious, is all.

00:17:58.369 --> 00:18:01.330
My apologies, sir.
Forgive our rudeness.

00:18:01.372 --> 00:18:03.165
It's not intended.

00:18:03.207 --> 00:18:05.710
The situation with Bahl
is quite urgent.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:09.839
If we speak out of turn or cross
any lines, that's the reason.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.174
The queen's character
isn't your concern.

00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:14.677
Regardless of why you're asking.

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:16.345
[ADEL]
As you say, sir.

00:18:16.387 --> 00:18:18.723
That was a most
impertinent question.

00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:28.065
Know this.

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:31.152
Her Majesty's choice
will be hers alone.

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:39.702
Iris. Queen Iris

00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:42.496
[ADEL]
Hey. Do you mind?

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:43.831
What's wrong?

00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:47.376
Kinda feel like I should
be the one asking you that.

00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:49.462
It isn't just
the weird question.

00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:51.922
You grabbed your sword like you
were gonna fight that knight.

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:54.383
Spoke out of turn
to the friggin' queen.

00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:56.594
You're a tough guy
to clean up after.

00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:00.848
Look, I don't like
these people either.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:03.267
They got gold spoons
up their butts.

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:04.560
And honestly?

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:07.730
I doubt that they can even
tell "demons" like us apart.

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:09.231
That isn't true.

00:19:09.273 --> 00:19:10.608
[ADEL]
You don't think so?

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.027
I can guarantee you that
when they hear "darkness"

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:15.655
they think "evil" right away.

00:19:15.696 --> 00:19:18.240
[ADEL] Know why the Queen of
Light's dragging her feet?

00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:21.369
It's so she can leverage this
to turn the war in her favor.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:25.122
You're wrong. Trust me.

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:28.250
She's not like that.

00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:32.004
I'm not tryin' to say that
all of them are terrible.

00:19:32.046 --> 00:19:33.422
I don't think...

00:19:33.464 --> 00:19:37.259
...it's really about
light and dark.

00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:39.804
[ADEL] Welp, we'll find out
if the queen feels the same

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:43.683
when she decides
on this alliance.

00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:45.142
Try and get some sleep.

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:47.019
Goodnight, Your Highness.

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:58.030
Are you up, too?

00:19:58.072 --> 00:19:59.573
Iris.

00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:08.332
[IRIS] I shall do my duty.
As the Queen of Light.

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:17.883
[IRIS]
My duty, and nothing more.

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:23.681
[IRIS] Such is my role.
The path I chose.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.815
[IRIS] I've considered
your proposed alliance.

00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:33.733
[ADEL]
Your grace.

00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:34.942
I'll choose...

00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:36.902
...once I've asked a question.

00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:38.404
[ADEL]
By all means.

00:20:41.532 --> 00:20:43.743
[IRIS]
My question is for you.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:49.582
Forgive me.

00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:52.209
But my bodyguard isn't
schooled in the ways of court.

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:54.211
Which is why I've asked him.

00:20:57.381 --> 00:21:00.843
The people of your kingdom.
How do they feel right now?

00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:06.724
[AIDE 01A]
Please, Queen Iris.

00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:10.144
What wisdom could you hope
to gain from a commoner‐‐?

00:21:20.571 --> 00:21:22.573
My people are afraid.

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:26.285
Death follows Bahl
wherever he goes.

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:29.914
I can't tell you what they'd
make of this alliance.

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:32.958
