[BLUE CATS chirp]

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:14.509
I figured we'd be called back,

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.678
but his majesty didn't
even bother to tell us

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.598
what he wants us for.
What a tyrant.

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:35.238
They've got it good here.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.990
[PHIOUS]
Talking to yourself?

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:41.912
Not a good look.

00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:44.748
Hey. It's good to see
you, too, Commander.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.334
I appreciate you coming
out to greet me.

00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:48.877
[PHIOUS]
Hmph.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:53.965
Uh? Wait, don't tell me
you're worried about me.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.133
Don't be absurd.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.844
I'm just worried about
what you'll do in Black.

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:10.065
[ADEL] I'll ask about the trade
agreement. And after that...

00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:11.900
Be careful.

00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:15.237
[ADEL laughs]
What did I tell you?

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:17.989
It'll all work out.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.825
You did say that.

00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:31.128
[ADEL]
All right.

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.381
We'll bid the queen farewell
and then take our leave.

00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:35.716
Right.

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:51.231
They're giving us so much.
These people sure are generous.

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:58.321
[GROZA] I think I might
miss this country.

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:02.659
But I can't let His Highness
spend any more time with her,

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:05.245
so this may have
worked out perfectly.

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:12.836
[PHIOUS]
Excuse us.

Hey.

[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Uh?

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.502
Take it.

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:54.878
[AIDE A]
Mm...

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:11.520
That letter requests
a trade agreement.

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:15.732
Go to your king and
speak to him in faith.

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:19.236
As you wish. This will
make a fine souvenir.

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:20.987
Thank you, Your Grace.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.782
I simply decided to
heed your words.

00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:25.826
Neither of our people
want to fight.

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:29.496
So if there's a chance we can
help them, let's take it.

00:05:29.538 --> 00:05:34.584
My hope is that both of our
Kingdoms can flourish. In peace.

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:46.263
I fear that this is
the end, Queen Iris.

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:49.766
Of course. You must go.
Until next time.

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:52.644
[ADEL]
No. There won't be a next time.

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:53.520
Uh?

00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:56.982
[ADEL] You say "balance" is the
governing law of this world.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.109
You think all life
is worth protecting,

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.695
and that does sound nice.

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:04.781
But only to those
with strength to spare.

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:07.033
For those who are
barely surviving,

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:10.120
those ideals are meaningless.

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.913
What exactly are you saying?

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:13.957
[ADEL]
Of course you people want peace.

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:16.209
Thanks to all the
sunshine and soul here,

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:21.506
and that pretty rune of yours,
you live lives of plenty.

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:25.719
But down in the mud,
everything's a struggle.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.262
We look up at this continent,

00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:30.765
and ask ourselves why we
have to live in your shadow.

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.642
Because there must be a balance.

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:35.061
Some live in shadow,
and some live in light.

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:38.148
That's been the way of things
since the dawn of time.

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:39.774
[chuckles]

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.946
[ADEL] Really? "That's been
the way of things"?

00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:48.950
You sit up here in your
paradise, and think

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.328
that this is balance.

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:52.162

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:53.163

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:55.540
This has to be a joke, right?

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:04.507
[ADEL]
You may wish my people well,

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:07.677
but coming from you,
that sympathy's worthless!

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:11.598
Try saying that once
you've fallen to earth!

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.934
Queen Iris, no!

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.436

[AIDE A]
Sir Phious! Seize that man!

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:55.433
You treacherous wretch.

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:59.229
Is this how you
creatures negotiate?

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.690
[groaning]

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:06.111
I'm glad you finally
showed us your true colors.

[PRINCE OF DARKNESS groaning]

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:17.497
I should've known you'd
betray us. Cur...

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:20.875
I was a fool for trusting you!

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:23.044
If this is how you want
it to be, then fine.

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:27.257
I'll erase you and the ground
you crawled up from!

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:29.509
Bring rope and bind him!

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:31.594
Wait, but he‐‐

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.851
[scoffs] I'll visit
your cell later.

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:42.063
And I'll take my time forcing
you to tell me what you know.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.901
[IRIS]
No...

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:49.529
He protected me.

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:50.488
You shouldn't stay here!

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.657
Quickly, we'll take
you to safety.

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.743
U‐Uh. Okay.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:12.844
This is all so nice. I'll have
to bring gifts when I come back.

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:20.935
[GROZA grunts]
What's going on?

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:22.979
It's the envoy.
He's been arrested!

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:23.855
We had to leave!

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:25.356
[GROZA]
What? Which envoy?

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.150
Sorry, we don't know
the details, ma'am.

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:30.236
We're... abandoning them?

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:33.073
[BAKASE] For now at least.
Let's wait and see what happens.

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:35.784
But we can't help
them if we leave.

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:38.661
What if... they're hurt?

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:53.468
[PHIOUS] Damn it! Friendship
between our kingdoms?

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:58.098
An absolute farce. Why? Damn it!

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.232
I'm hurt, too.

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:11.277
But stop beating yourself up.

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:14.030
The Queen's all right,
so it's fine.

00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:15.115
Like hell!

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.116
[gasps]

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:17.784
Calm down, brother.

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:20.495
[grunts]

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:27.627
[PHIOUS] I'm sorry, Sheama.
To you as well, Theo.

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:30.213
I just don't understand anymore.

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:32.590
What don't you understand?

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:38.012
What it means to protect
the balance.

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:42.725
Right now, it seems the knights
are doomed to fight forever.

00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:49.023
And if so...

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:56.489
[THEO] Wait, "forever"?
We're not gonna live that long.

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:59.242
So why should we worry about it?

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:00.869
Theo?

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:04.455
[THEO] Honestly, I don't know of
anything that lasts forever.

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:09.127
Look, I had a fight with
the kid next door,

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:12.046
but I know we'll get
over it eventually.

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:15.258
In fact, if I tried to hold
a grudge for too long,

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.385
I bet you two would
get mad at me.

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:19.387
[PHIOUS]
Theo...

00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:23.141
[THEO] I can let go of my anger.
Why can't all of you?

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:25.518
I mean, you're grownups.

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:29.397
You'll understand someday.

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:32.650
No, I won't. I don't want to.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:34.110
Wait!

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:44.829
Sorry, Phious.

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:49.417
One day, when Theo
gets to be an adult‐‐

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:53.880
he can find a way to end
this pointless conflict.

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:57.217
At least that's my hope.

00:11:57.258 --> 00:12:00.803
Yes. He has a kind heart.

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:03.389
[PHIOUS]
But...

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.099
...I can't.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.441
When all else is unclear,
we have our duty.

00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:16.361
And we mustn't waver.

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:18.238
I suppose not.

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:24.327
Don't stay up too late tonight
if you can help it.

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:25.995
See you tomorrow.

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:28.706
[door clicks]

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:33.253
Duty. Right.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.800
[PHIOUS]
Lost as I feel,

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:43.137
I'm sure my worries are nothing
compared to the queen's.

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:45.556
I won't fail you again,
Your Grace.

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:49.269
No matter what happens,
I'll keep you safe.

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:55.275
[IRIS] Black on earth.
White in the sky.

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:58.069
Both sides are essential
to the balance.

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:00.613
So why must we fight each other?

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:04.826
O' Progenitor Rune.

00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:08.538
If earth and sky are meant
to despise each other...

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:12.041
If this is the way
of the world...

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:15.837
...then I don't know
how long I can last.

00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:21.342
The mere idea of standing atop
all that hatred‐‐it's horrible.

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:23.303
I just can't...

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:26.723
[gasps]

00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:35.023
[VOICE]
White Priestess. Queen of Light.

00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:37.942
You must make a decision

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:41.821
about what it is we
are meant to protect.

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:46.826
About what it is... that
we're meant to protect?

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:21.944
Phious...

00:14:25.823 --> 00:14:28.743
I was a fool for trusting you!

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:36.167
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Then they took me here.

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:38.878
Huh.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.838
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
In that moment...

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:47.470
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Why did I choose her over him?

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:50.973
We were supposed to establish
friendly ties with White,

00:14:51.015 --> 00:14:54.852
so maybe I was just
carrying out my mission.

00:14:54.894 --> 00:15:00.024
But I can't imagine why Adel
would try to kill the queen.

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:02.985
Unless he was ordered
to without me knowing.

00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:06.322
If that's the case,
then maybe letting him do it

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:10.535
would've been better
for the people of Black.

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:13.663
I don't know.

00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:17.959
Regardless, it's done.

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:22.672
Afterwards, I wanted to say
something to the queen.

00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:24.924
What was I trying to tell her?

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:36.227
It's all black.

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:39.605
[gasps]

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:44.527
The land, and the people
who live upon it,

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:52.118
we're all his. No one has
the power to resist his will.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.872
So please, don't hate us.

00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:59.167
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
No. That isn't right.

00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:03.212
It sounds like more of
an excuse than an apology.

00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:06.340
I have all night
to choose my words.

00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:07.842
[gasps]

00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:18.269
A white cat?

00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:23.566
From where?

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:25.902
[clanging]

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:30.531
It... opened.

00:16:34.368 --> 00:16:36.329
You want me to come with you?

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:41.375
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Strange...

00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:06.400
There isn't a single guard here.

00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:10.446
It's almost like they
want me to escape.

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:16.679
[grunts]

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:30.610
It's Iris.

00:19:01.223 --> 00:19:02.767
[gasps]

00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:34.256
[IRIS] We can coexist.
You and I are proof of that.

00:19:34.298 --> 00:19:37.468
You do feel the same, right?

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:42.848
[IRIS] Not all good things
are born of light.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:46.143
Darkness has every
bit as much value.

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:51.816
It takes both to find peace.
That's what I believe.

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:53.401
And yet...

00:19:55.986 --> 00:20:00.616
[inhales, exhales]

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:01.492
You're safe.

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:03.119
Huh?

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:08.833
We want the same thing.

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:12.211
To help... both our people.

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:15.673
And leave happiness in our wake.

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:19.176
Towards that end, as best I can,

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:21.512
I'll support you from the mud.

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:27.184
Follow the path you believe in.

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:29.311
You'll find your way.

00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:40.197
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
I never actually told you...

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:44.243
I'm the Prince of Darkness.
Next in line to be king.

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:47.955
[IRIS]
I know. I could feel it.

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:49.582
I'll take the throne.

00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:53.294
And once I've done it,
I swear...

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:56.297
I will help you bring
peace to this world.

00:20:58.424 --> 00:21:00.551
You have my word.

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:02.011
[IRIS]
Thank you.

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:08.809
[IRIS] Black and white. Darkness
and light. Earth and sky.

00:21:08.851 --> 00:21:13.105
Though we may be apart, we'll
still support each other.

00:21:13.147 --> 00:21:15.524
Without fail.

00:21:15.566 --> 00:21:20.070
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Yes. Till next we meet.

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:21.655
[IRIS]
Till then.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:23.908
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:31.624
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
I have to go.

00:21:31.665 --> 00:21:35.419
Thank you for all
you've done for me.

00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:38.214
You saved my life.
I've repaid you.

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:42.134
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
You'll wait for me, right?

00:21:42.176 --> 00:21:43.886
For when the time comes?

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:47.932
Yes.

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:49.934
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
You aren't alone.

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:51.769
I hope you know that.

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:57.024
[IRIS] Light and darkness
exist on opposite poles.

00:21:57.066 --> 00:22:00.903
They maintain a balance
without ever touching.

00:22:02.571 --> 00:22:05.282
[IRIS]
I know you'll keep your word.

00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:07.827
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS
grunts, panting]

00:22:07.868 --> 00:22:11.831
[IRIS]
And I swear, I'll do the same.
