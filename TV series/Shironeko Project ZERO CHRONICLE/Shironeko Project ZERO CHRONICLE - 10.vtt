WEBVTT

00:00:12.763 --> 00:00:15.724
[IRIS]
I'm responsible for my subjects.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.518
But I'm also charged
with upholding the

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:20.646
balance between
light and darkness.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.065
From the moment I became queen,

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.984
I've felt the weight
of that balance.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.861
If it's ever disrupted,

00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:31.406
the very fabric of this
world will begin to unravel.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:35.369
It's a law that can
never be rewritten.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.955
I can't help but
feel strange about it.

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:40.666
I order my people
to fight the darkness,

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:44.044
yet I'm complicit in
its continued existence.

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.132
[IRIS] Is this simply the way
things have always been?

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:51.969
Is this balance
between light and dark

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.931
one that can only be
upheld through violence?

00:00:55.973 --> 00:00:59.768
I don't want to believe that
the world has to be like this.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.814
But the truth is
I can't change it.

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:05.816
Not alone.

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:11.905
[IRIS] All I can do by myself is
fight to maintain the present.

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.979
[SHEAMA] It looks like
we'll make it just in time.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.981
Now to see if we can hold.

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:14.236
[SHEAMA]
Hurry back, Phious. Please.

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.789
[PHIOUS]
A dead end?

00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:29.835
No. I don't believe it is.

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.336
Huh?

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.630
[ALANTIA]
We just need to go up.

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.257
[PHIOUS]
How?

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:37.759
Perhaps I should
simply demonstrate.

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:01.324
There's a passage here.

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:03.827
Ah. I see.

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:10.292
[gasps]

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.802
Think you just saved my life.

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:23.054
Yes. Now let's go.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.222
[PHIOUS]
Hm.

00:04:26.892 --> 00:04:29.227
[PHIOUS]
Looks like a straight shot.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.730
It's too dark to be certain.

00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:34.858
I have no idea where
this path might lead.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.194
We should proceed with caution.

00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:47.662
[METIS MAGE 10A gasps]

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.372
[METIS MAGE 09A]
I'll take them.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.137
We came as fast as we could.

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:05.972
Lady Sheama!

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:08.099
Now.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.935
Mages, up to the walls.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.312
Knights, you'll
fight in the streets.

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.856
Be brave and we'll
make it through this.

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:17.192
‐‐[KNIGHT 10A] Right.
‐‐[KNIGHT 10B] Understood!

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.861
[BOTH grunt]

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.080
[PHIOUS] Come on!
How long can this tunnel be?

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.207
We've lost too
much time already.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.961
[ALANTIA]
Something isn't right.

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:42.008
[ALANTIA]
Hm?

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.094
Look at that.

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:45.428
Huh?

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.854
[PHIOUS gasps]

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:57.941
We've been following
a tunnel to nowhere.

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:06.157
[CITIZENS shouting]

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.706
[KNIGHT 10C] You need to
run, ma'am. It isn't safe!

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:22.340
[KNIGHT 10C]
Go, hurry!

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:24.718
Okay.

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.428
[KNIGHT 10C grunts]

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.807
[METIS MAGE 10B]
More monsters.

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.934
They're appearing
in the streets.

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:35.312
We're in trouble.

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:38.106
[ALL yelling]

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:42.861
What do we do?

00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:49.451
Wow.

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:52.621
Did you do that
without the rune? Amazing.

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:55.498
No. I used the rune's power.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.959
Huh?

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.670
[ALANTIA] I keep it stored
in bottles like this.

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:04.925
I get it. Well done.
You continue to impress.

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:08.428
How many do you have?
And can anyone use them?

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.679
[ALANTIA chuckles]

00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:17.520
[grunts]

00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:26.488
Is that the place?

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:35.288
Here goes! [yells]

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:40.502
‐‐[PHIOUS grunting]
‐‐[sword clanging]

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:49.886
I think it's a puzzle.
Step back for a moment.

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:51.596
Let's see if this works.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.453
Lord Alantia, have
you been here before?

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:18.748
[ALANTIA]
Never. The idea just came to me.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.168
[PHIOUS chuckles] I'd've had no
chance if I'd come here alone,

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.795
so thank you.

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:25.630
[ALANTIA]
Hm.

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:30.844
[panting]

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:41.730
[ALANTIA]
Here we are.

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:43.898
[PHIOUS]
Those are the Shining Droplets?

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:48.236
[ALANTIA]
Hold on!

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:50.697
[ALANTIA] They hold a vast
concentration of pure soul.

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:53.158
It's both powerful
and dangerous.

00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:05.545
[ALANTIA]
We should withdraw for now

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.589
so we can devise precautions.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:08.715
[PHIOUS]
No.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:17.307
[PHIOUS groans]

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:18.725
Phious!

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:26.232
We can't afford to waste
even one more second.

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:28.777
The forces of darkness could
be closing in on our homes,

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:31.237
attacking our
people as we speak.

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:34.324
[PHIOUS]
Even with Sheama to lead them,

00:09:34.365 --> 00:09:36.868
my knights must be in disarray.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.246
[PHIOUS]
Still...

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.625
[PHIOUS]
...Queen Iris comes first.

00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:45.794
She is their hope.

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:50.632
[PHIOUS groans]
If the queen falls,

00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:53.218
all is lost.

[PHIOUS grunts]

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:20.870
Well done.

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:23.164
Thanks.

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:24.415
Let's go.

reach the palace!

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.721
[KNIGHT 10E]
Yes, ma'am!

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:41.099
We'll hold them right here.

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:57.198
‐‐[IRIS grunts]

[GROUP]
Right.

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:07.041
[MAGES]
Become manifest!

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:09.752
One of the seven great powers:

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.257
[MAGES]
Shield of Affection!

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:33.443
It's working.

00:11:33.484 --> 00:11:35.945
[IRIS grunts]
Yes, it is.

00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:39.657
But it won't last.
Let's retreat to the palace...

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.367
...and plan...

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:44.287

[PHIOUS]
What's going on?

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:55.465
[ALANTIA]
Darkness has attacked in force.

00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:58.301
That's a Shield of Affection.
Considering its size,

00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:01.012
I'm guessing the
queen helped cast it.

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:02.472
[PHIOUS grunts]

00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:05.183

How do we get back up?

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.792
[GROZA]
Yeah. Good question.

[GROZA]
Are you all right?

00:14:48.012 --> 00:14:50.723
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS] It was
a close call, but I'm okay.

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:52.058
Thank you.

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:55.103
Yeah... sure.

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:58.523
Anyway, let's go home.

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:00.400
Our work is done here.

00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:04.821
Is everything okay?

00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:07.407
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS] It's just,
do you think we'll ever get to

00:15:07.448 --> 00:15:09.242
visit the Kingdom
of White again?

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:12.245
[GROZA grunts]
I don't know.

00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:14.163
It's difficult to tell
what the King of Darkness

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:16.165
might be thinking.

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:17.792
And after what happened,

00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:20.420
I doubt that White
would welcome us.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.175
[GROZA]
Tell you what,

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:29.178
I picked up some tasty looking
fish from the market today.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.722
Why don't I cook us both dinner?

00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:33.224

Hm.

[GROZA]
Here. Hope you like it.

00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:47.363
[GROZA] You're gonna be
the King of Darkness someday,

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:50.491
so you need to
keep your strength up.

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:52.910
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
The King of Darkness.

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:55.496
I'm not sure...

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:58.082
...that I can.

00:15:58.124 --> 00:16:01.377
[VALLUS] It's the nature
of darkness to envelop all.

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:05.590
Good... evil... everything.

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:09.677
Darkness grows. It is a veil
that must never be lifted.

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:13.681
It will continue to expand as
long as there is space for it.

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:15.933
And that has been
the truth of this world

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.769
since it came into being.

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:20.938
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
Is that the truth?

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.233
No. I can't accept that.

00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:26.486
I can't even consider it.

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:31.657
What matters is the promise
I made to the queen.

00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:32.909
[chair clatters]

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.744
Hey, what are you talking about?

00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:36.078
One day, you'll be king.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.414
What could possibly
matter more than that?!

00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:40.249
Aren't you still
fighting for an ideal?

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:42.001
Then why don't
you tell me about it?

00:16:42.043 --> 00:16:43.544
What's your plan for the future?

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:45.922
Please, let me stand beside you

00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:48.007
and help you change
things for the better.

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:51.177
I just want to be with you.

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:56.349
Ever since the day we first met,

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.018
since the moment I saw you...

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.271
[gasps]

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:09.654
...I've completely adored you.

00:17:37.014 --> 00:17:38.975
[GROZA]
And you feel the same...

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:42.937
[GROZA]
But not about me.

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:46.399
You want a future
with Queen Iris, right?

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.158
[GROZA]
I see.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.328
Well, in that case, I‐‐

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:00.997
I'll‐‐

00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:02.999
[GROZA crying]

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.001
[PRINCE OF DARKNESS]
W‐Wait, Groza!

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:11.507
[GROZA]
I'll still stand by you.

00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:17.096
[GROZA] I'll always
support you however I can.

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:18.973
No matter what.

00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:27.189
[PHIOUS]
Sheama! I'm back!

00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:30.192
Hey, you made it.
Just where have you been?

00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:32.987
We'll talk once the queen
is well. This should help her.

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:34.530
Take it.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.034
Pure soul.

00:18:52.715 --> 00:18:54.050
[IRIS grunts]

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:58.471
So what do you think?

00:18:58.512 --> 00:19:01.140
[SHEAMA]
It'll work, I'm sure.

00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:06.354
[SHEAMA]
Sorry we're so late.

00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:08.439
[THEO]
Is Queen Iris better?

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:10.024
She is.

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:11.942
[sighs]

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:13.277
[THEO laughs]

00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:17.448
Things are bad. Black
attacked when you left.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:22.078
We did our best but,
we were overwhelmed.

00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:24.413
[PHIOUS] I heard what
happened from the knights.

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:27.333
I'm sorry.

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:32.046
The shield can't last forever.
We need a plan of action.

00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:34.840
[PHIOUS] I know. We'll make
our preparations quickly,

00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:38.719
drop the shield, and fight.

00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:40.304
[SHEAMA]
Okay.

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:49.230
[IRIS]
If things go on like this,

00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:52.149
I won't be able to
maintain the present.

00:19:56.237 --> 00:20:00.157
[IRIS] I just don't
know what I should do.

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:02.243
We want the same thing.

00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:05.746
To help both our people.

00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:08.958
And leave happiness in our wake.

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:12.420
Towards that end, as best I can,

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:14.839
I'll support you from the mud.

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:20.302
Just follow the
path you believe in.

00:20:20.344 --> 00:20:22.138
You'll find your way.

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:24.598
[IRIS whimpers]

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:33.858
[IRIS] There's only
one path I want to follow.

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:38.738
And that is the
path that leads to you.

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:40.448
[PHIOUS]
Queen Iris.

00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:44.076
Uh, sorry for interrupting
your prayer, my queen.

00:20:44.118 --> 00:20:46.787
But the decisive
battle is close at hand.

00:20:46.829 --> 00:20:50.541
So with respect, please
consider getting some rest.

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:53.252
Uh. Sorry, Phious.

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:56.422
I would hate for my actions to
give you any cause to worry.

00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:57.298
[PHIOUS]
I mean,

00:20:57.339 --> 00:21:00.593
it's my duty to protect
you so of course I worry.

00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:02.511
I'm truly grateful
for your service.

00:21:02.553 --> 00:21:03.971
Thank you very much.

00:21:04.013 --> 00:21:06.182
Please, there's
no need for that.

00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:08.476
[IRIS] But that's
really the least I can do.

00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:10.019
Having you and
Sheama to depend on

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.104
has been an absolute blessing.

00:21:12.146 --> 00:21:14.482
You two are always there for me.

00:21:14.523 --> 00:21:17.735
Forgive me. This is improper,

00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:19.153
but I have to say,

00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:24.533
to me and Sheama,
you're both Queen and family.

00:21:24.575 --> 00:21:26.660
She and I treasure you.

00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:29.830
[IRIS giggles]
That's sweet of you, Phious.

00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:32.792
I treasure you, too.
Thank you so much.

00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:35.503
I'm so glad to
have you as family.

00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:38.088
Uh, one last thing‐‐

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.133
I won't let the forces
of darkness harm you.

00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:44.053
Please consider
that a solemn vow.

00:21:44.094 --> 00:21:45.721
[IRIS]
Thank you very much.

00:21:45.763 --> 00:21:47.473
Now you're thanking me too much.

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:50.267
[IRIS chuckles]
I suppose I am.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.354
Please try to get some rest.

00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:56.023
Yeah. Sure.
