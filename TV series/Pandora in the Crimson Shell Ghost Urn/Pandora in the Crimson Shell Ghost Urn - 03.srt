00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,625
I know things were a
little bit crazy yesterday.

164

But just so you know, Cenancle
Island's a very peaceful place.

Warning: imminent
attack. Danger looming.

168
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,833
Hey. What is it?

169
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,166
Is something wrong?

170
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,125
[CLARION] Threat to
Nene Nanakorobi confirmed.

175
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:58,875
[TAKUMI]
Get that mutt!

176
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,041
You can do it, yeah!

177
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,541
[laughing]

178
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,000
Aunt Tak.

179
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,708
I'm sorry. So you've been
cyborized, as well, Takumi?

180
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,958
Yeah, yeah.

181
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,458
But unlike you and
your full prosthetic body,

182
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,708
everything besides
but what's needed

183
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,416
for my cyberbrain
mainframe is real flesh.

184
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,166
The stupid government
officials and all the annoying

185
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,791
human rights groups keep
making a big stink about it.

186
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,541
But I don't care
what those losers say.

187
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,833
Don't you think your cyberbrain
is pretty awesome, too?

188

I don't think I've
had one long enough

to really form an opinion.

190
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:24,916
But it's all right.

191
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,541
[TAKUMI]
It's a question of time, yeah.

192
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,666
Someday this technology
will transform the world

193

00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,333
[NENE] Only thing is, sometimes
I completely lose track

195
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,458

--[NENE] Huh?

197

[LADY 3A]
Whoa!

198
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,666
[NENE]
I am so sorry, Miss!

199
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,541
[TAKUMI laughing]

200
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:42,750
[NENE]
Cla-ring. Here.

201
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,625
I'll wipe that off for you.

202
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,833
I know, I know.
I won't touch your ears.

203
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,875
Someone's "Little
Miss Careless" today.

204
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,833
Wait, why don't you like
having your ears touched?

205
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,833
[TAKUMI]
I've just got to know, yeah!

206
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,583
Come on, don't run away!

207
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,208
[NENE]
Don't do that, please.

208
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,666
Apparently, Uzal's little
puppet is faster than it looks.

209
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,333
[laughs] Let's see how
it handles this!

210
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,375
[TAKUMI]
Your mistress is in a fix, yeah.

211
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,958
Now what are you gonna do?

212
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:29,458
[NENE] Help me, Cla-ring,
I'm spinning out of control!

213
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,125
[TAKUMI] It might've
avoided my cage, yeah.

214
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,708
But let's see how
well the peculiar thing

215
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,833
does when I lure
it into my trap.

216
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,250
As much as I hate to
admit it, you're pretty good.

217
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,208
But... In the end,
you're just a puppet.

218
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,208
Aww, look at you
trying to resist me!

219
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,208
Don't you know what
defeat looks like?

220
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,291
Not the ears!

221
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,083
Sorry, but once
my curiosity is piqued,

222
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,541
there's no stopping me!

223
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,500
I've gotta touch those ears!

Oh, come on, this'll be fun!

No!

Step away from her right now!

Ah! The barriers!

[TAKUMI yells]
You obliterated all of my data!

234
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,125
I worked really hard
to tune this terrarium,

235
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,291
and then you come in
and ruin everything!

236
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,916
Oh! I almost forgot!

237
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,500

to be a welcome parade

[NENE]
Hey! Don't pick on Cla-ring!

241
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,958
I don't think it's nice
to do something to someone

242
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,416
when you know
they don't like it!

243
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
[TAKUMI]
What is she?

244
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,875
How did she get in here?

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,708
Tell me!
When did you figure it out?

I don't know.

248
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,708
[TAKUMI]
Wait a minute!

249
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:26,958
I gotta check something!

250
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,791
What exactly have you
been doing from the time

251
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,416
you arrived at
my house until now?

252
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,375
First, Cla-ring
and I were sterilized.

253
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,833
Then, we sat on the couch
and plugged into your system.

254
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,500
After that, we played
a really fun game

255
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,333
where we went for a walk
in a shopping mall!

256
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,958
Wait... A game?

257
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,208
So you knew it was fake
from the very start?

258
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,666
But that terrarium
is advanced enough

259
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,125
to trick even a
military grade AI, yeah!

260
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,333
Guess I'm just really
good at playing games.

The Cenancle Self-Governance
Organization has announced

274

that the damage to the
city around Vulcan Harbor

275

was the result of
a suicide bombing.

internationally wanted

been confirmed by authorities.

are forthcoming.

then you don't know me at all!

00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,833
design data files! We--

320
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,291
Uh... Do you wanna see? Here!

321
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,958
[TAKUMI] We're gonna have
to do a complete overhaul

322
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,458
on the design or else--

323
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,458
[NENE]
She's busy with work.

324
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,666
[TAKUMI] Get dressed and
wait in the next room, yeah!

325
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,208
The weather is perfect today.

326
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,541
So you two should go shopping
for real this time, yeah.

327
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,625
I'll have some
Gertsecommas escort you.

328
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,000
It's like they say, "better
safe than sorry," yeah!

329
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,041
'Kay!

330
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,000
[NENE]
See you later!

331
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,375
And what about you?
Do you need anything?

332
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,958
[CLARION]
Just equipment and backup.

333
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,083
[NENE]
All right! Sounds good!

334
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,041
[TAKUMI]
So she's after them, yeah?

335
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,125
The question is which
one is her target?

336
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,875
Is it Nene?
Or is it Uzal's puppet?

337
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,833
[NENE]
Oh, right!

338
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,083
Um... Hey.

339
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,916
Is it okay if I call
you guys "Gercomas"?

340
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,583
Are you the ones
who helped us stop BUER

341
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,833
from destroying the island?

342
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,291
They're still
under development,

343
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,666
so there are new versions
being created all the time.

344
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,208
The ones who helped
us underground

345
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,083
were a previous version.

346
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,916
They're basically
the same, though.

347
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Got it. You sure do
know a lot, Cla-ring.

348
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,166
If it weren't for your friends,

349
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,208
a whole lotta people
might've been hurt.

350
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,416
Thank you.

351
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,958
You sure are a sweet boy!

352
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,500
Gertsecommas
don't have feelings,

353
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,833
so they can't be "sweet."

354
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,458
What a weird girl, yeah.

355
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:47,208
[NENE humming]

356
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,416
[TAKUMI]
Hey, Nene!

357
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,416
Could you run a little
errand for me, yeah?

358
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,083
[NENE]
Sure! No problem!

359
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,208
[TAKUMI] Thanks,
I'll send you directions!

360
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,333
[NENE]
This is it.

361
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,833
She said to come to Area Charon.

362
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,166
Wow!

363
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,291
Look at all these strange
billboards, Cla-ring.

364
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,458
Normally, I would never send
her to the Pleasure District,

365
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,125
but it's the middle
of the afternoon.

366
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,125
There won't be a soul
in sight at this hour.

367
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:23,333
Now that I've given you an
opening, let's see what you do.

368
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,958
Which one are you after, yeah?

369
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,583
I don't care if it's Uzal's
stupid puppet, but if it's Nene,

370
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,000
I'll squash you and the
entire organization behind you

371
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,416
like the nasty little
bugs you are, yeah!

372
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,166
Let's go.

373
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,541
[TAKUMI]
Hurry up and follow them, yeah!

374
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:44,750
[MASKED GIRL]
Whoa, whoa!

375
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,458
Enough already, yeah!

376
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,166
What are you after, criminal?!

377
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,166
[MASKED GIRL yells]

378
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,000
Hold on, these are
Sahar's robots!

379
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,375
Wait a second,
so you know Sahar, yeah?

380
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,208
[yells]

381
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,916
[TAKUMI]
You'd better give up, yeah!

382
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,166
[BUNNY]
Don't touch me there!

383
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,750
[TAKUMI] You're younger
than I thought, yeah.

384
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,125
State your affiliation
and objective!

385
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,250
Look, lady,
this isn't your concern!

386
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,833
My people are counting on me
to get BUER's authentication key

387
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:11,833
and you're screwing that up!

388
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,208
BUER?! Hold on...

389
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,708
Who are you and how
do you know about BUER?

390
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,250
Viral intrusion?
I'm being hacked!

391
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,708
It looks like they're
penetrating the link

392
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,208
to my Gertsecommas!

393
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,458
How is this possible?

394
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,458
No one's ever been able
to get past my firewall!

395
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,708
Who is it, yeah?

396
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,208
Yeah, yeah, it's me, yeah.

397
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,958
You shouldn't
be spying on people!

398
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,583
It's like déjà vu.

399
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,625
Also...

400
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:39,625
Cla-ring wanted
to keep that secret,

401
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,000
so she asked me to intervene.

402
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,083
[TAKUMI] You're talking
about BUER, yeah? Oops.

403
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,125
Too late now.

404
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,375
Listen up!

405
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,666
I don't know what the
heck is going on here!

406
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,208
But let me go!

407
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,041
Just so you know,
I didn't plan to follow you.

408
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,791
I just happened to see you.

409
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,375
Remind me... Who are you, again?

410
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,750
You don't remember me?

411
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,875
Hello! The bunny suit?

412
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,208
If I had the chance, I'd...

413
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,750
I would make it mine.

414
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,416
Huh?

415
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,833
[BUNNY]
Oh, never mind!

416
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,916
It doesn't look like you
have them on you, anyway!

417
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,875
You know where
Sahar's glasses are?

418
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,041
[NENE]
Wait, glasses?

419
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,458
Oh! Do you mean those?

420
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:15,333
That's right.

421
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,125
BUER's real authentication key!

422
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,208
Let's see...

423
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,208
Huh... What did happen
to those things?

424
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,166
Oh, Nene!

425
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,125
Please remember.

426
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,625
I really need them by tomorrow!

427
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:24,958
By tomorrow?

428
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,458
[BUNNY]
Yes. By tomorrow!

429
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,833
That's them!

430
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,250
I see. You want me to beg? Fine!

431
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,750
Please have mercy on me and
give me those glasses, Nene!

432
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,208
Stop. I have an
urgent message for you.

433
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,958
Who is it from?

434
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,166
Hey there, morons!

435
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,875
I guess this means
you're still alive.

436
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:43,791
Look, it's Uzal.

437
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,166
[UZAL]
Knowing you losers,

438
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,750
I have to wonder if the
mastermind has captured you,

439
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,375
and if you're now in
danger of being killed

440
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,125
so you won't run your mouths.

441
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,166
But I'm sure that
would never happen!

442
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,958
[UZAL]
However, if you are in trouble,

443
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,500
I have some wonderful news.

444
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,958
I've left specific instructions
for you to be given the key.

445
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,750
First, you have to shake
your butt three times

446
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:01,750
and hop like a bunny rabbit.

447
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,041
[BUNNY]
Hop, hop, hop!

448
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,458
[UZAL] Just kidding,
you don't have to do that.

449
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,583
You stupid idiot!

450
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,958
Was that your last will?

451
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,208
Well, you'll get
no gratitude from me!

452
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,000
Consider it a severance package.

453
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,750
Give my love to the mastermind.

454
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,291
I guess it's over...
Least I hope.

455
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,416
Nene? There is a
place I'd like to visit.

456
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,583
[BUNNY]
I got the key, sir.

457
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:26,791
[KURTZ]
Oh?

458
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,000
[BUNNY] That is BUER's
authentication key.

459
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:32,250
[KURTZ] A storage key
in the form of glasses, eh?

460
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,833
I took you from the
hands of the police

461
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,416
to keep information
from leaking out.

462
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,791
Of course there's
a much simpler way

463
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,375
to make sure you don't
run your mouth, isn't there?

464
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,291
[BUNNY]
Give me another chance, please!

465
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,458
I know all about BUER;
I can be useful to you!

466
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,291
We had a deal, right?

467
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,333
You promised!

468
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,416
[KURTZ]
Yes, I suppose that's true.

469
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,291
But have you considered
how many precious hours

470
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:56,416
of my time were lost due to
your group's foolish blunder?

471
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,750
I apologize.

472
00:20:58,833 --> 00:20:59,833
[NENE]
I know this place.

473
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,666
This is where we
came up to the surface.

474
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,125
[CLARION]
It's sooner than planned.

475
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:06,208
But once Takumi was made
aware of the keyword BUER,

476
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,458
I was told that
I could disclose this.

477
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,583
[BUER] Much time did I
spend in silent contemplation.

478
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,500
Time enough to arrive
at the truth of the matter.

479
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:19,666
Lout!

480
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,500
Thou took too long
to come and rescue me!

481
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,708
Oh, how I detest dark places!

482
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,125
Calm down.

483
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,041
If it were up to me, you
would've been buried for months.

484
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,041
[BUER]
I am experiencing great fear.

485
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm sorry. We forgot about you.

486
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,000
[BUER]
Thou art a cruel beast!

487
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,333
But verily, if thou were
to be kind and console me

488
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:38,958
against thy meager bosom,
I would forgive thee thy crimes!

489
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,000
[BUER]
Curse thee!

490
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,083
Thou would imprison
me once again

491
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,416
within the dark
confines of the earth?

492
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,750
I am BUER the demon king,
philosopher of Hades!

493
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,833
[TAKUMI] So that's the
infamous BUER, yeah?

494
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,458
[BUER] Indeed, thou who sounds
as if her bosom is small.

495
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,625
I am endowed with five
legs of the goat, and I--

496
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,625
[TAKUMI] So you're still
not finished yet, yeah?

497
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,041
[BUER]
Nay. BUER is complete!

498
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,875
I am the Central Nervous Unit,
the key to BUER,

499
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,666
equipped with cipher
intelligence of the rarest kind!

500
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,000
'Tis no exaggeration to
say I am its soul and spirit!

501
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,208
Mine massive, willful
body is currently at rest

502
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,875
beneath the surface,
but 'tis starting up

503
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,541
in normal fashion!

504
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:14,833
Excellent.

505
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,416
Good old Uzal...

506
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,958
She finally finished
what she started.

507
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,458
That terrorism incident...

508
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:21,916
Uzal's puppet showing up...

509
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It's all connected, yeah!

510
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,583
[BUER]
Ohohoho!

511
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,208
[TAKUMI]
This thing sure is a handful.

512
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,833
But I won't let Uzal or
anyone else have it, yeah.

513
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,416
Now that it's been pushed
off on me, it's mine!

514
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,875
[TAKUMI] Nene, you better come
home before it gets too late!

515
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:35,541
[NENE]
Yes, ma'am!

516
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,041
[BUNNY] Uh, sir?
About the rest of my group?

517
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,625
[GIRLS crying]

518
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,375
[KURTZ] You brought me
the key before the deadline,

519
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:42,791
so our deal stands.

520
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,791
Your friends'll live.

521
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,416
With our help, you'll be
able to steal it for sure!

522
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,375
[KURTZ] "Steal" makes
this sound so scandalous.

523
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,708
Now that Sahar
Schehera is dead...

524
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:56,041
That thing? It belongs to me.

525
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,458
Tell the truth, Cla-ring...

526
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,125
Why don't you like people
touching your ears?

527
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:33,000
Are you ticklish?

528
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,458
That's classified information.

529
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,500
You know what I think?
I think you like it!

530
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,125
[squealing]

531
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,875
Okay. Unplug me.

532
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,708
[TAKUMI] So, Nene, you're going
to attend a Net school, yeah?

533
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:31,875
[NENE]
Yeah, I am.

534
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,958
But shouldn't I get
a job to repay you?

535
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,333
[TAKUMI]
Nonsense.

536
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:37,291
A child's only job is
to go to school and learn!

537
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,583
[NENE]
Yes, ma'am!

538
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:40,500
[TAKUMI] Meanwhile,
I'll help myself to BUER!

539
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,125
[giggles]
