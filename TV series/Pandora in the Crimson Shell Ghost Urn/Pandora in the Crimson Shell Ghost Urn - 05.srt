00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:59,791
Wake up. It's morning now.

00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,208
[NENE yawns]

4
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,875
[NENE] Cla-ring, do you know
if your joints are waterproof?

5
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,291
Yes. They are sealed properly.

6
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,750
Please turn your
back this way, Nene.

7
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:20,250
Hey! You're tickling me!

8
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,125
What goes around comes around!

9
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,625
[CLARION]
Ah...

10
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:54,208
[BUER]
Dark. Cramped. Scared.

11
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,458
Time to go.

12
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,166
[BUER]
Hark!

13
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,750
This smooth sensation
is undoubtedly

14
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:03,958
a flat-chested maiden

15
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,250
nuzzling me against
her ever so tiny bosom!

16
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,875
Oh. Hi, Gercomas!

17
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,666
Where are you going?

18
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,958
Do you mind if Cla-ring
and I tag along?

19
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,041
[beeping]

20
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,625
No, that's okay,
we don't mind walking.

21
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,083
Thank you, though.

22
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,041
Besides you three guys,

23
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,666
do you know how many
Gercomas there are total?

24
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,791
Oh! Hello, Takumi!

25
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,666
Gertsecommas are
hazy on the concept

26
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,875
of the individual.

27
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,208
Don't waste your time.

28
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,500
They can't understand
vague questions like that!

29
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,375
Take a look at this, Nene!

30
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:28,208
It's a Gertsecomma
factory, yeah!

31
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,333
Wow!

32
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,000
[TAKUMI] One by one, each of
these menacing mechanisms

33
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,208
is slowly and methodically
assembled here

34
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,250
in this incredible plant.

35
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,458
[TAKUMI]
Pretty neat, yeah?

36
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:45,958
[TAKUMI]
Their current production count

37
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,541
is 1,031, and that
number grows every day.

38
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,833
The Gertsecommas
are incredibly flexible!

39
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,916
They can change their
options by unitizing

40
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,541
and simplifying their machinery.

41
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,916
They're Takumi's supreme
masterpiece, yeah!

42
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,166
Except that the fundamental
design is Uzal's.

43
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,833
True. But I'm not impressed.

44
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,958
She always makes one-eyed,
egg shaped robots

45
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,166
'cause she thinks
they're super creepy.

46
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,541
Eyeballs are super creepy!

47
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,291
When she first saw the design,
Takumi was thrilled.

48
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,291
But then immediately
she looked annoyed.

49
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,083
It's true.

50
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,583
And then Takumi said--

51
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,083
[TAKUMI]
"Well, if you insist,

52
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,333
I suppose I could make your
stupid robot for you, yeah!"

53
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,375
[CLARION]
Did you not?

54
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,958
Shut up! Shut up!

55
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,375
Shut up, yeah!

56
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,541
[NENE]
Takumi?

57
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,958
[TAKUMI]
Where are you going now, yeah?

58
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,291
To the park.

59
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,333
There's a little something
I'd like to try today.

60
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:43,208
Just watch out for any
nasty bot-nappers, yeah!

61
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,708
Right. I guess we'll
see you later then!

62

[KIDS yelling, chattering]

It's juggling time!

Well, look at that.

Oh my!

73
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,916
[NENE] I can't believe I can
actually do something like this.

74
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,083
It's amazing!

75
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,708
[cheering]

[NENE]
Everyone seems to love it!

77

[BUER] At water's edge,
a scant-chested maiden

stareth in melancholy
as a gentle breeze

sounds of seagulls--

80
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,333
Do you consider that a failure?

81
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,583
It seemed to me everyone
enjoyed themselves.

82
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,541
A testament to
the Pandora Device.

83
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah, you're right.

84
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,666
They were so happy.

86
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,166
Is this not a step
in the right direction

87
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,166
of the world peace
that you desire?

88
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't know. It just
doesn't feel right to me.

89
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,166
No offense.

90
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,541
But in the end,
it's your power, not mine.

91

Clarion belongs to Nene.

92

[BUER]
Hot!

93
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,666
It seems sneaky to
use somebody else's power

94
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,333
for your own benefit.

95
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,583
Seems sneaky?

96
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,875
Do you mean to say
that it's unjust?

97
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,250
Yes.

98
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,791
Think about it this way.

99
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,666
Can you really accomplish
world peace by yourself?

100
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,541
[NENE]
Huh?

101
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,583
The power of others is unjust?

102
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,375
Power is only just if
it's yours to start with?

103
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,250
How do you measure
what is truly yours?

104
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,208
Or what you've
learned from others?

105
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,583
[NENE]
Yeah. Good point.

106
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,666
Technically, I guess
I'm not all mine either.

107
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,041
It's true.

108
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,125
I was made by other people.

109
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,208
My prosthetic limbs
were given to me.

110
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,708
Everything.

111
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,416
Cla-ring, you're right.

112
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,708
Maybe I'm a little
sneaky, as well.

113
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,208
[ANNA] Oh. Are you
already done for the day?

114
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,666
Well, that's too bad.

115
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,166
Maybe there'll be a
second performance later?

116
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,833
You're quite special.

117
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,125
Thank you, but...

118
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,250
I'm not special.
I was just practicing.

119
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,500
You're as modest
as you are talented.

120
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,250
I've seen some of the
best street performers

121
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:09,166
in the world and they
don't hold a candle to you.

122
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,708
Thanks for the compliment.

123
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,500
But the truth is,
it's not really me

124
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,541
that's good at juggling.

125
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,291
I beg to differ, young lady.

126
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,416
I never expected
that rehabilitation

127
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,333
would be so difficult.

Truth be told,

idea of having the darned thing.

130
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,291
Sorry.

131
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,208
I just sprung that on you
rather suddenly, didn't I?

My name's Anna.
What's your name, dear?

Oh. Right.

It's a pleasure to meet you.

I was quite surprised
to see a child like you

using a prosthetic
limb so skillfully.

can't move mine very well!

I see. I'm very sorry.

No, please.

00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,250
[KOTOBUKI] Save us the boring
lecture about right and wrong

326
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,541
and hand over the
damn robot right now,

327
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,333

She's more than just a robot!

329
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,541
Look at her. She's a girl!

330
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,583
Oh, man.
This guy's crazy. Full-on!

331
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,000
What can you do?

332
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,750
And we just hate resorting
to violence so much!

333
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,000
Yes.

334
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,875
I couldn't agree more.

335
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,166
I was hoping we could settle
this peacefully, as well.

336
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,375
Uh oh.

337
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,833
Is this guy just really
strong or somethin'?

We're okay. Yes!

bringing her back to me!

Sorry to hold up the show,

but I gotta make sure these

349
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:40,875
[NENE]
It's okay.

350
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,208
We can make it home from here.

351
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,083
It's just not in my nature
to let bad guys get away.

352
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,041
Sorry for getting you and your
friend involved in this mess.

No! Please don't apologize!

World peace is built
on things like this!

World peace, huh?

00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,750
That's great!

I'll do my best to live

Goodbye.

You're a good egg, Nene.

You know, Cla-ring...

I think we did a lot to
achieve world peace today!

What's wrong?

It's Anna!

What happened?
Are you all right?

00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,750
This is awful.
She needs a doctor!

369
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,875
I'll call an ambulance!

There's no connection.

something that you want to do,

just use the Pandora Device.

373
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,250
Is it sneaky to use someone
else's power for good?

[NENE]
What?

You're right. Anna's hurt.

I know how to deal with this!

This power may not be mine,

388
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,125
but at least I can do
something good with it!

389
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,833
She doesn't just
have a prosthetic limb.

390
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,416
She's also using artificial
internal organs.

391
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,750
Since she's not cyberized,

392
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,333
they're monitored
via the network.

393
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,625
That's why the

We really need to play doctor,

dress up like a nurse
