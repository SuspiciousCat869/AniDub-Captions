When you and I connect,

[CLARION]
That's not a transformation.

74

Taste?

78
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,500

there always a flash of light?

[CLARION]
When the light shines,

it's examining your
current appearance.

00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,000
[NENE] What about when
my clothes disappear?

00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,541
[CLARION] They don't
actually disappear, Nene.

90
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,000
Optical camouflage
is essentially a tool

91
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,375
to render something invisible.

92
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,208
[NENE] But why do the
old clothes have to go away

93
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,041
before the new ones appear?

94
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,833
[CLARION] Curiously,
the software is set up

95
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,125
so they don't happen
at the same time.

96
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,875
The reason is unknown.

97
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,041
[NENE] After that,
the really bright light

98
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,875
starts shining again.

99
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,166
And then I'm done
changing clothes!

100
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,833
It's just an illusion.
You don't actually change.

101
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,791
[NENE] Can I use optical
camouflage to choose clothes

102

00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,875
[ALTMAN] I don't.
I just stopped by to help out.

161
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,666
Oh. That's very kind of you.

162
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,416
[laughing]

163
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,166
I guess it's just the way I am.

164
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,458
Hello, Captain!

165
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,375
[ALTMAN]
Men. At ease.

166
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,500
As you probably know,
this forced relocation

167
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,166
has the citizenry concerned.

168
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,375
Not to mention the
network disturbances.

169
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,375
And the recent rash
of robot thieves, to boot.

170
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,375
Stay focused and alert.

171
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,500
Sir!

172
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,500
[CHICKEN]
Lookee here...

173
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,500
Two high-grade androids
strolling down the street.

174
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,208
It'll be like takin'
candy from a baby.

175
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,250
This is why it's always
smart to keep an eye out

176
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,541
in the rich neighborhoods.

177
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,583
Those two walkin' scraps
of junk are worth more

178
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,125
than a freakin' luxury car.

179
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,291
That is so cute!
They're holding hands!

180
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,708
They're like sitting ducks.

181
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,916
Boss, can we
grab some grub after?

182
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,541
[COCCO clucking]

183
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,208
[CHICKEN]
Welcome back, CoCCo!

184
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,791
Nice recon work out there!

185
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,458
Are you guys ready or what?

186
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,166
According to our info,
there's about to be

187
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,416
another widespread
network disturbance!

188
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,875
The CDF doesn't have time
to bother with petty thieves,

189
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,916
but don't get sloppy
and leave behind any clues

190
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,583
that'll trace back to us!

191
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,416
Well? Let's do this!

192
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,583
[UNDERLINGS]
Yeah!

193
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,125
Oh, crap!

194
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,916
[UNDERLING 7B] The one with
the ears must be a guard!

195
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,208
[UNDERLING 7C]
Be careful!

196
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,166
[NENE]
Cla-ring! Watch out!

197
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,208
[BUER]
Petty criminals!

198
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,166
Meet them in battle!

199
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,375
[CLARION]
Unable to report.

200
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,458
Oh no.

201
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,458
[UNDERLING 7A]
It's not working! What do we do?

202
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,708
I think we're gonna
need some back up here!

203
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,333
Get her, Mr. Fried!

204
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,750
Take refuge, Nene.

205
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:16,625
Cla-ring!

206
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:17,333
[BUER]
Me too!

207
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,500
[grunting]

208
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,875
[shooting noise]

209
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,916
[CHICKEN] What the heck's
takin' you guys so long?

210
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,125
Let's hurry up
and get outta here!

211
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,500
[UNDERLING 7A]
Mr. Chicken?

212
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,041
[CHICKEN]
Huh?

213
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,000
[CHICKEN] It's not worth much
if you break it, little brother.

214
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,083
Right.

215
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,750
[CHICKEN]
Nice! It's airborne!

216
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,625
Aim your capture
nets, boys! Fire!

217
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,666
It's heavier than it looks.

218
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,458
At least it's ours now.

219
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,541
Whoa! I never seen one
armed like that before.

220
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,625
This one might be
more than we can handle.

221
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:19,958
[UNDERLING 7E]
We better hurry, Boss!

222
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,250
If the network disturbance ends,

223
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,541
the CDF will have
us dead to rights!

224
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,541
Damn.

225
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,333
I guess we better
get moving then.

226
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,208
Forget about the heavy one and
ditch the egg-shaped one, too.

227
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,833
But let's take the humanoid.

228
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:31,875
[UNDERLINGS]
Yes, sir!

229
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,125
[UNDERLING 7D] Can't you
move any faster than that?

230
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,583
[BUER]
Hark. Ye lot are lucky!

231
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,625
I shall let you go, for now!

232
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,458
Another disturbance!

233
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,000
This is terrible, yeah!
The worst!

234
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,166
What happened to Nene?
Her signal's gone!

235
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,041
Oh, good grief!

236
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,416
What do I do, yeah?

237
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,958
[TAKUMI]
Agh! Hey, wait, yeah!

238
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,958
What's the matter
with you, puppet?

239
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,875
I'd better look at
the log real quick!

240
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,166
[TAKUMI]
Nene was abducted by thieves?!

241
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,083
Who do they think they're
dealing with, yeah?

242
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,291
I won't stand
for this injustice!

243
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,916
Those scum of the earth losers
must be shielding Nene's signal.

244
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,125
But...

245
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,083
I bet they're using
an escape vehicle, yeah.

246
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:36,000
Island traffic
info search. Engage!

247
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,166
Analysis of surveillance
camera footage.

248
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,875
Narrow down candidates.

249
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,375
[TAKUMI]
I found it, yeah!

250
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,416
These thieving jerks
have been looting the island

251
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,416
ever since the
disturbances started.

252
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,833
It's no surprise they'd zero in

253
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,250
on Nene and Uzal's
little puppet,

254
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,166
given how much they're
worth on the black market.

255
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,416
My information quarantine
was absolutely flawless,

256
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,416
but I was foolish and
careless not to even consider

257
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,333
the possibility of
random petty thieves, yeah!

258
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,416
If Uzal ever finds out
I put Nene in danger

259
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,875
'cause of a stupid
mistake like this,

260
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,666
she'll make fun of me
for the rest of my life!

261
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,208
Wow, you sure are dumb!

262
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,208
[laughing]

263
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,083
[TAKUMI screams]

264
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,416
[siren blaring]

265
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,708
[TAKUMI] I'll take them
down before it's reported

266
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,250
to the CDF, yeah!

267
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,291
Attention, Gertsecommas!

268
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,291
Deploy with extermination
equipment now!

269
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,666
Hey! Time to stand down, puppet!

270
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,958
Rendezvous with my
forces immediately!

271
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:31,166
[TAKUMI]
Hey!

272
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,458
[TAKUMI]
Get on, yeah!

273
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,875
[TAKUMI]
Let's fly like the wind, puppet!

274
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,208
[WOMAN 7A]
Aww, how cute.

275
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,416
[TAKUMI]
You're heavy, yeah.

276
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,166
[DAVID]
Check that out! So cool!

277
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,666
Cla-ring? Was that you?

278
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,166
[TAKUMI] Looks like
this must be the place.

279
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,875
Let's do recon until
my reinforcements arrive.

280
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,875
[TAKUMI] First, we'll figure
out where Nene is, yeah.

281
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,458
Then our plan will depend
on what we find once we get--

282
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,583
[TAKUMI]
I got cut off again, yeah!

283
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,875
[CHICKEN] Well, I never
thought you'd actually be able

284
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,250
to follow us.

285
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,500
Welcome to our hideout.

286
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,166
Hey, CoCCo. Good job, buddy.

287
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,291
Boys? Let's finish
what we started.

288
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,000
[CHICKEN] And this time,
try to make it quick, all right?

289
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,583
[BUER]
We shall rout you, fiends!

290
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,125
[UNDERLING 7B]
What's the deal?

291
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,166
It looks like we got company.

292
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,375
I think we'd better
get out there, guys!

293
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:00,833
[NENE]
What the--?

294
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:04,333
[rustling]

295
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,208
It's cramped in here!

296
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,250
I got it open!

297
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,750
What happened to me, anyway?

298
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,000
Where am I?

299
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,250
[NENE]
What is this place?

300
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,125
[NENE]
Um... Hello there, friends.

301
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,500
[NENE]
Hold on! Where is Cla-ring?

302
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,416
Damn.

303
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,625
If the CDF finds this place,

304
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,708
we're gonna have to
look for a new hideout.

305
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,500
Well...

306
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:43,958
That's fine;
this place sucked anyway.

307
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,375
Good riddance.

308
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,708
And besides, we're getting
a high quality catch

309
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,750
out of the deal!

310
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,708
Hurry up and nab
that cyborg, Fried,

311
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,875
but whatever you do,
don't break it!

312
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,458
Okay.

313
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,125
But bro, this one's quick!

314
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,458
Yeah, It might be fast,

315
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,916
but without a human being
telling it what to do,

316
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,458
that puppet's as
worthless as a pile of junk.

317
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,291
It might be able to defend

is a third-priority matter.

477
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,291
[NENE] You wanna know what
my top priority matter is?

478
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,458
Hugging you with all
of my might, Cla-ring!

479
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,208
Squeeze!

480
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,833
[TAKUMI] Glad to see
you two are so close, yeah!
