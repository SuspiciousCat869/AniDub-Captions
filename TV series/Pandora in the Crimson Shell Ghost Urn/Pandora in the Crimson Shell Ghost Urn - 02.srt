00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,000
[NENE]
Whoa. So that's BUER?

2
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,125
This is not good.

3
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,208
Wait... Buy peace? For real?

4
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,458
The island's in danger.

5
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,250
If we don't save it,
no one will.

6
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,666
Well, what do you say?

7
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,083
Should we give it a shot?

8
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,708
Mmm... All right.

9
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:55,791
Thatta girl!

10
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,208
Of course, we wouldn't
be in this mess

11
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,541
if it weren't for those
morons over there.

12
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,666
Thanks to them,
my company's robot

13
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,750
is bringing the city
to the brink of collapse.

14
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,125
What robot?

15
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,000
[UZAL]
Its formal name is BUER.

16
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,333
It's a giant boring machine
my company created.

17
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,250
I've never seen a
bowling machine before.

18
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,375
[SCHOOL UNIFORM]
"Boring," not "bowling!"

19
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,125
[BUNNY] Besides, "boring
machine" doesn't even

20
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,333
begin to cover it--

21
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,416
[yells]

22
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,458
So we beat the machine,

23
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,416
and everything goes
back to normal, right?

24
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,250
Indeed!

25
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,500
You're our only hope, Nene.

26
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,625
No one can stop it but you!

27
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,708
[NENE] All right!
But are you sure I can do it?

28
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,333
Clearly, you'll
need Clarion's help,

29
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,833
but of course you can!

30
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,583
Okay.

31
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,125
[UZAL] Unless the two of you
join forces and work together,

32
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,500
I fear BUER will
sink this entire city!

33
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,708
[NENE gasps]

34
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,000
[NENE] Shouldn't we
repair her arm first?

35
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,416
[UZAL]
Yeah, good call.

36
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,958
[NENE gasps]
Cla-ring!

37
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,541
[NENE whimpering]

38
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,833
[UZAL]
Well, Nene, what do you say?

39
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,125
Will you team up with
Clarion and give her a hand?

40
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,500
A hand? Oh my!

41
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,958
Me fighting alongside
my new best friend?

42
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,666
Of course! With Clarion,
there's nothing I can't do!

43
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,375
You're incredibly brave.

44
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,958
And now for the plan.

45
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,958
[UZAL] I wish the
time limit on her using

46
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,791
the Pandora Device
could be longer.

47
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,208
What a letdown.

48
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,250
So sparkly!

49
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,958
Now that everyone's
on the same page,

50
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,916
it's time to
get down to business.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,375
First, why don't you
take a look at this?

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
[NENE gasps]

53
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,041
[UZAL]
Clarion.

54
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,791
What's the situation with BUER?

55
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,333
[CLARION]
We have a precise location.

56
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,458
Three hundred fifty
meters below ground,

57
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,541
BUER is at the base of
subterranean shaft G11,

58
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,708
beneath Vulcan City.

59
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,625
[NENE]
Gosh, it's so far down!

60
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,375
[UZAL]
What you see here is BUER.

61
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,708
[NENE]
An eyeball?

62
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,666
[UZAL] Not very practical,
but definitely creepy.

63
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,916
[NENE]
Yes. It certainly is.

64
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,958
[NENE]
Is it recharging?

65
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,250
[UZAL]
Clarion.

66
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,875
Sum up the plan for
neutralizing BUER, please.

67
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,791
After BUER fires its cannon,

68
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:16,083
there's a cooling period
that lasts 180 seconds.

69
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,875
But the more it fires, the
greater the heat it generates,

70
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,791
which means the
cooling takes longer.

71
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,625
Cla-ring is the
coolest of all time!

72
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,500
That's too boring.
Lighten it up a little!

73
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,875
[CLARION]
As you wish.

74
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,583
[NENE]
How cute!

75
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,416
[CLARION] First, we press a
frontal assault to provoke BUER.

76
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,916
This should cause it to fire.

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,375
While the cannon is cooling,
we approach and shut it down.

78
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,916
--[UZAL] Hmm...
--[CHINA DRESS] This is nuts!

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,833
--[BUNNY] We're all gonna die!
--[GYM UNIFORM] I quit.

80
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,208
Shutting it down is easy.

81
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,666
You simply call the main console

82
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,500
and use the authentication
key, understood?

83
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,916
Where's the key, you ask?

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,541
Don't you worry!
It's right here.

85
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,958
[ALL]
What, those?

86
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,291
That's what I need
to do to disable BUER?

87
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,625
[UZAL] No, Clarion
will take care of that.

88
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,250
What I need for you to do
is to be her bodyguard.

89
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,541
Nene will cover
Clarion using this.

90
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,500
[UZAL]
Where were you?

91
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,833
[BUNNY]
Cut us some slack!

92
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,000
We dug our way to the vault
as fast as we could!

93
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:15,875
Whoa!

94
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,291
What is this, some kind of gun?

95
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,708
[UZAL]
It's a prototype.

96
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,208
But it should be a good piece
of backup for Clarion.

97
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,541
Is it real powerful?

98
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,375
[UZAL]
"Quick" is the word I'd use.

99
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,791
It's as fast as light.

100
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:26,916
[CLARION]
I'll use this.

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,458
Nene.

102
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,208
I certainly hope you don't take
what I'm about to say to you

103
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,791
the wrong way.

104
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,625
But this equipment is not meant
for a flesh-and-blood human.

105

[NENE]
Here we go.

106
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,333
We start our attack
in one minute.

Oh boy.

108
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,666
I'm so tense.
I've gotta calm down.

109
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,708
Hey, Cla-ring. Are you scared?

110
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,458
Hm? I know fear.
I'm not scared.

111
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,333
[UZAL] How about we
start by buying peace

00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,416
Right.

Okay!

If I'm by your side,
then I'm not scared either!

not the things you see!

I said it twice
because it's so true!

124

What conspiracy lurks
at the bottom of this darkness?

They'll be fine, Nene.

digging out the lab yet?

162
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,791
[MAID OUTFIT]
I just now finished it!

163
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,583
[UZAL]
Well... So far, so good.

164
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,041
[NENE]
Ah!

165
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,541
She's amazing!

166
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,291
[UZAL]
Clarion! You're there!

167
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,666
[UZAL]
We're all set! Good job, Nene!

168
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,833
[NENE sighs]

169
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,583
Thank you!

170
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,375
[UZAL] There's an emergency
terminal near the very top.

171
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,083
All you need to do
is activate that,

172
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,333
and it'll accept external input.

173
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:50,958
Okay...

174
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:56,291
[CLARION] This is the
main console? Weird...

175
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,625
[BUNNY]
What... is... that thing?

176
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,625
That's certainly
a rude question.

177
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,750
To be honest, I don't have time
to explain the details to you.

178
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:05,666
Clarion.

179
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,541
Hurry up and use
the key, please!

180
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,708
Use the key?

181
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:14,791
So I put these... on there?

182
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:15,916
[NENE gasps]

183
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,583
[NENE]
Look out!

184
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,500
[NENE]
Ha! Cla-ring!

185
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,125
[UZAL gasps]

186
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,250
[ALL gasp]

187
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:40,583
[NENE panting]

188
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,916
[UZAL]
Nene! Nene!

189
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,958
[NENE] She gave me good luck
so I'd always be safe.

190
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,416
[NENE] And I gave my
good luck to Cla-ring,

191
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,208
so she has to be okay.

192
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,000
Direct hit!

193
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,791
Save us!

194
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,041
[UZAL]
Oh boy.

195
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,708
Here comes the cavalry.

196
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,750
Your robot better pull this off,
or we're dead meat!

197
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,541
Uzal? Uh... What is this?

198
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,500
[UZAL]
It's called a Gertsecomma.

199
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,083
It's something like
a pet for Clarion.

200
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,791
[NENE]
All right.

201
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,458
But... Cla-ring is...

202
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,250
[UZAL]
Relax, Clarion's fine.

203
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,583
[NENE]
Huh?

204
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:19,791
[UZAL] Who do you think
is operating that machine

205
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,541
you're riding?

206
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,833
[NENE]
Then... Where is she?

207
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,166
[UZAL]
Right there.

208
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,833
Oh, no, she's trapped!

209
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm impressed Clarion
managed to send backup

210
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,833
in such a tough situation.

211
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,333
Of course, it didn't
hurt matters any

212
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,416
that I set Nene's protection
as her number one priority.

213
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:39,916
Wait!

214
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,333
Look! Nene!

215
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,250
[UZAL]
Uh oh!

216
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,041
She's within BUER's
defensive zone!

217
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,208
Gertsecommas! Help her now!

218
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,125
Nene shouldn't have
that kind of agility.

219
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,416
[UZAL]
Oh, I see.

220
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,750
She's not dodging
the attacks per se;

221
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,333
she's taking advantage
of her skill

222
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,875
by anticipating BUER's
fire-control system.

223
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,375
What kind of talent is this?

224
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,000
Is she an adepter
like I thought before?

225
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,250
Or is she something
entirely different?

226
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,541
[NENE]
I can't get any closer!

227
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,250
Interesting!

228
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,375
Nene.

229
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:20,291
[CLARION]
Get on.

230
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,416
[NENE]
Cla-ring!

231
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,541
Huh? Oh. Like this, right?

232
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,333
Oh! Whoa!

233
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,166
Whoa! Whoa!

234
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,708
I've got to
get to Cla-ring fast!

235
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,125
Here I come!

236
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,000
[NENE]
Whoa!

237
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,625
Support.

Are you okay?

241
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,791
Hold on!
I'll get you outta there!

242
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:03,708
[CLARION]
Listen.

243
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,041
I'm stuck and I can't move.

244
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,541
Leave me behind
and go stop BUER.

245
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,750
Huh? I can't!

246
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,166
Incorrect.

[grunts]

248
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,333
I have complete
faith in you, Nene.

249
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,541
Go now!

250
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,625
Do this for World Peace!

251
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,041
Cla-ring! I'll do my best!

252
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,333
[laughing]

253
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,583
Well, what do you know?

254
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,083
Clarion's starting to
learn to manage Nene.

255
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,625
Still, it's a really
big deal for her

256
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,666
to set her pride aside and rely
on somebody besides herself.

257
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,958
All right! I'll be back!

258
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,500
[NENE] For Cla-ring,
and for world peace!

259
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,583
[NENE] Get ready, BUER.
Here I come!

260
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:51,875
[NENE]
First things first,

261
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:55,250
I need to put the
glasses on the statue.

262
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,208
I can't do it! It's broken!

263
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,750
Oh, don't worry!

264
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,791
I've made plans
for this situation.

265
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,333
Relax. I have options for you!

266
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,958
[UZAL] Put them on
whichever you'd like!

00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,125
[NENE]
Right!

268
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,208
[BUNNY] Why in the world
are you making her

269
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,708
go through all of
these shenanigans?

270
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,125
[UZAL]
'Cause it's fun!

271
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,166
[NENE]
Okay. Here goes nothing!

272
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,708
It's over now. I think.

273
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,708
[GIRLS cheering]

274
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,250
Just when I think
I've seen it all,

275
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,375
that Nene surprises
me yet again.

276
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,833
I wish I could savor
this moment and enjoy it.

277
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,625
[UZAL] But this
is no time for that.

278
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,583
I suppose things did
get a little out of hand.

279
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,583
But that's the way it goes.

sequence, initiate.

281
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,416

[UZAL] Nene! Retrieve
the authentication key!

284
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,000
[NENE]
Uh... Right!

285
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,958
[UZAL] Also, I'm about to detach
BUER's Central Nervous Unit.

286
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,166
Now that you have the key,

287
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,041
I'd like for you to
retrieve that as well.

288
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,000
[NENE]
Central Nervous?

289
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,375
[UZAL]
After you're done,

290
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,541
go get Clarion and withdraw
immediately, understood?

291
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,583
[NENE]
Yes!

292
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,958
[BUER]
Mine name is BUER!

293
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,916
Art thou the one to rescue me
from this everlasting nightmare?

294
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,875
Oh, well...

295
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:44,541
Uh, yeah. I guess. I'm Nene.

296
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,416
[BUER] Splendid!
I do commend thee, Nene!

297
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,875
Do you happen to know what
the Central Nervous Unit is?

298
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,708
[BUER]
'Tis I, of course!

Ah! It's moving? Oh no!

00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,333
It's not supposed to move now!

[BUER] 'Tis but a return
to default mode.

Please, make it stop!

00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,458
You're gonna crush Cla-ring!

[BUER]
'Tis required, for a reboot.

You have to help me!

00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,708
[BUER]
I am a philosopher of Hades,

and eternal knowledge

of the infinity
of time and space.

To do so would be easy enough!

show me thine underwear.

00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,791
[CLARION] I used the
Gertsecommas as cushioning,

322
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,416
but now I can't move.

323
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,958
I'm exactly twelve
meters up from you.

324
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,416
Nene. Thank you.

325
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,000
[UZAL]
Excellent work, you two!

326
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,250
[CLARION]
I can walk on my own.

327
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,833
[NENE]
No! You need my help.

328
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,083
Well... Nice job.

329
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,208
Unlike those idiotic
lame-os behind me.

330
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,416
[GIRLS growl]

331
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,375
[BUER] Idiotic lame-os,
and traitors to boot.

332
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,416
I know not what to do
with these rogues.

333
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,833
Who is this half lion
half goat freak show?

334
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,583
[UZAL] We're escaping,
so if you wanna live,

335
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,500
you better tag along,
you losers.

336
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,958
[BUNNY]
You're the loser, loser!

337
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,333
[UZAL laughs] Then I assume
you winners have at least

338
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,833
secured an escape route?

339
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,625
Oh, save us!

340
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:51,916
I'm not ready to die!

341
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,333
Yeah. Same here!

342
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,500
That way.

343
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,208
[GYM UNIFORM]
Ah! The water's coming in!

344
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,625
[SCHOOL UNIFORM]
This place is finished!

345
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:58,875
[BUNNY] It's breaking
through the walls!

346
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,041
[CHINA DRESS]
We're all gonna die in here!

347
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,625
[UZAL]
Oh, calm down.

348
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,458
Unlike you, I'm not a big loser.

349
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,625
So I made sure this emergency
elevator was available.

350
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,708
[BUNNY]
Hooray!

351
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,291
[CHINA DRESS]
We're not gonna die now!

352

--[BUNNY] Hey! Squeeze in!
--[CHINA DRESS] Ow!

--[UZAL] Oh.

356
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,125
[UZAL]
Uh oh, that's no good.

357
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,041
Over the limit.

358
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,750
[ALL laugh]

359
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,458
You fat fatty! Ha!

360
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:30,541
Tons of fun!

361
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,583
You cow!

362
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:32,916
[UZAL]
Fine, whatever.

363
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,208
Have it your way. Go without me.

364
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,375
[ALL]
Huh?

365
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,458
Hey... Wait!

366
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,916
Hold on just a sec!

367
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,500
What gives, Sahar?

368
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,958
You're not the
self-sacrificing type!

369
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,958
What kind of game
are you trying to play?

370
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,708
Sahar!

371
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,583
[UZAL]
Nene.

372
00:20:58,666 --> 00:20:59,958
[NENE]
Uzal!

373
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,750
I'll be all right,
so whatever you do,

374
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,291
don't worry about me.

375
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,458
I'm sorry for running
you so ragged today.

376
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,583
[NENE]
That's all right.

377
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,833
You didn't get
your World Peace,

378
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,750
but we'll try again
next time, okay?

379
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,250
[NENE]
Okay, Uzal.

380
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,958
[UZAL] Unfortunately, I'm
afraid I don't have any peace

381
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,125
that I can sell you right now.

382
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,375
But there's something
else I can give you.

383
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,000
Clarion?

384
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,875
Go with Nene, please.

385
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,458
[UZAL]
Nene.

386
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,458
Look after her for me, will you?

387
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:37,500
[NENE gasps]

388
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,833
I'll make her happy!

389
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,750
What is she talking about?

390
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,125
Thanks, Nene.

391
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,000
[UZAL] One day you'll find
the peace you're looking for.

392
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,916
I truly believe that.

[NENE]
Don't be sad.

394

Uzal said she
would be all right.

395

[BUNNY]
Of course she'll be all right!

396
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,125
She lives any way
she darn well pleases!

397

She's not just gonna up and die!

398
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,875
[CHINA DRESS] She wouldn't
die if you killed her.

399
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,583
Stupid jerk.

400
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,125
[elevator dings]

401
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,083
Are we at the surface now?

402
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,000
We're okay, aren't we?

403
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,375
I don't know, but we better
get outta here and fast!

404
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,916

about the details later!

[NENE]
Uh... What?

406
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,708
Hey! When we use
the Pandora device,

407
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:32,416
does it make you
feel awkward, too?

408
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
No, I am not programmed
for that emotion.

409
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,500
So it doesn't embarrass
you when I leap into the air

410
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,750
and grab onto you like this?

411
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,916
No, but it does
make me annoyed.

412
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:29,916
[NENE]
Aren't you excited?

413
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,791
Now we can finally
go see Aunt Takumi!

[CLARION]
Who is that?

415
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,041
[NENE]
She's my aunt, of course!

416
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,583
And I bet she's
really cool, too!

417
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:38,708
I mean, I hope she is.
I've never met her before.

418
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:42,000
[CLARION] Expectations tend
to yield disappointment.
