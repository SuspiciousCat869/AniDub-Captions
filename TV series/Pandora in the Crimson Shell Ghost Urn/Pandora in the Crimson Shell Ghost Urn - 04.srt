[BUER screams]

2
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,208
[TAKUMI]
Just accept it, yeah!

3
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,916
I can't let something
inside my home

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,791
when I don't know what Uzal's
built into it, now can I?

5
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,083
Let's open you up and have
a look at your guts, yeah!

6
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,958
[BUER screams]

7
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,666
[TAKUMI]
What the heck?!

8
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,833
[CLARION]
All right, no more of that.

9
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,250
[TAKUMI]
What are you doing here, yeah?

10
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,000
Nobody can get in here, yeah!

11
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,666
Oh. Hacker mode.

12
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,083
I suppose that
explains it then, yeah!

13
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,291
But, why?

14
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,625
It's not as if I was
trying to do anything

15
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,416
to the puppet, yeah!

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,291
Sorry, but Cla-ring
says she doesn't want you

17
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:31,500
breaking BUER!

18

[BUER]
Wah!

19
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,958
I do thank you for
your kindness and concern,

20
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,250
humble-bosomed girls!

21
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,125
It is clear your feelings
for me runneth deep

22
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:40,083
and I am ready to
receive them in kind!

23
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,250
Uzal ordered me to keep
you out of Takumi's hands.

24
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,875
I must do whatever it takes.

25
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:46,041
Even kill you.

26
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,000
[BUER yells]

27
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,416
[TAKUMI]
Darn that Uzal.

28
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,583
That woman makes my blood boil!

29
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,833
Cla-ring?

30
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,625
Do you want to hold
hands for a little bit?

[MALE VOICE 4A] Application for
enrollment screening interview

32
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:59,208
confirmed. Next
applicant, please proceed.

33
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,250
I'm Nene Nanakorobi.

34
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,333
Thank you for interviewing me!

35
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,666
[FEMALE VOICE 4A] Please relax,
and just try to be yourself,

36
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,833
all right?

37
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,166
[NENE]
Okay!

38
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,083
[MALE VOICE 4A] Why exactly
do you want to study

39
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,250
at this school?

40
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,791
[NENE] I've dealt
with a lot in my life.

41
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,791
When I was young,
I got really sick.

42
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,208
And then I lost my
parents in an accident.

43
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,666
But even so, many people--

44
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,083
[FEMALE VOICE 4A] All right,
now for the last question.

45
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:25,083
What is your goal for the
future, Miss Nanakorobi?

46
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,875
To achieve world peace!

47
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,208
[FEMALE VOICE 4A]
Pardon?

48
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,541
That's my dream.

49
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,916
My life will be a success
if I make that happen.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,166
[FEMALE VOICE 4A]
Understood.

51
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,250
[MALE VOICE 4A]
That concludes the interview.

52
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,541
Thank you so much for your time.

53
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,666

Miss Nene Nanakarobi.

on your enrollment!

[computer beeps]

58
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,791
What is it?

59
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,041
Homework.

60
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,125
[TAKUMI]
Come on!

61
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,333
I wanna examine BUER right now!

62
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,958
I wanna open up that little
demonic five-legged freak show

63
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,666
and find out exactly
what Uzal was up to!

64
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,333
It's not fair, yeah!

65
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,750
Nene's the problem.

66
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,000
She's the one
standing in my way.

67
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,291
She waltzes right through
my beefed-up security wall

68
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,916
like it's nothing.

69
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,416
A formidable girl, yeah.

70
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,541
And it's impossible to separate
Nene from that stupid puppet!

71
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,583
I have to figure out a
way to distract them both

72
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,250
at the same time, yeah.

73
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,208
I need to think of something
that would engross her

74
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,250
more than the puppet.

75
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,833
But what?

76
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,291
Oh! Yeah!

77
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,000
[DRAGON roars]

78
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,333
[TAKUMI]
What do you think, yeah?

79
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,083
I tried remaking a retro game

80
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,208
using a modern
direct link engine!

81
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,458
[NENE]
Wow!

82
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,208
This is Monster Bash, isn't it?

83
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,458
You're darn right it is!

84
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,291
You should play it all day!

85
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,166
[NENE]
Come on. Let's go!

86
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,791
[TAKUMI laughs]

87
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,500
Now I can examine BUER!

88
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,291
Except this time,
they can't stop me!

89
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,875
[TAKUMI]
Well... That didn't take long.

90
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:20,541
[NENE] I guess I'm just
good at figuring out games.

91
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,833
[TAKUMI]
Look! I'm trying to help!

92
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,583
You can't just leave
this thing lying around!

93
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,000
Someone might steal it.

94
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,166
You should let me keep a
close eye on it for you, yeah!

95
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,291
[CLARION]
No chance.

96
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,625
[BUER] Darkness falls
over me once again!

97
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:36,916
I can't see!

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,166
Mommy, I'm frightened!

99
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,916
Please, help me;
there's a scary man

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,416
with an axe under my bed!

101
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,375
Now we don't have to worry!

102
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,125
What's the deal, yeah?

103
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,416
It's real hard to work
when you're both

104
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,958
staring at me like that!

105
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,458
You don't have to stand watch.

106
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,583
I won't try anything
with BUER, yeah!

107
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,166
No. That's not it.

108
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,375
I'm actually doing
a homework assignment.

109
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,041
[TAKUMI] The student
will observe professionals

110
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,125
while they work.

111
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,625
Then compose a report
with an emphasis

112
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,666
on what they felt while watching
the job being performed.

113
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,000
Well, my work isn't
really geared toward

114
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,083
that kind of thing at all, yeah!

115
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,958
How about I give you
a letter of introduction

116
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,208
to several businesses
I'm involved with instead?

117
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,875
Feel free to observe
any of them you like, yeah!

118
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,791
Thank you so much!

119
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:54,000
This is gonna be fun!
Don't you agree?

120
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,375
[TAKUMI] Are you keeping up
with the maintenance

121
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,833
on your prosthetic body?

122
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,500
There is no need to worry.

123
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,166
I will take
excellent care of her.

124
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,500
[TAKUMI]
All right then, yeah.

125
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,000
Have fun, and I'll
see you later, yeah!

126
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,375
[NENE]
See you later!

127
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,958
[TAKUMI] She really doesn't
know how to be suspicious

128
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,833
of people yet, yeah.

129
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,750
Easy. All too easy.

130
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,083
Doing schoolwork is weird.

131
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,541
You don't want to do it?

132
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,375
Oh, no. This is fun.

133
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,416
It's just...

134
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,791
Considering my goal
of world peace,

135
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,750
I wonder if it's
a wise use of time.

136
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,083
How do you mean?

137
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,708
I know learning
is a good thing.

138
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:29,958
But before I came here,

139
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,333
I was helping do research
that would benefit

140
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,666
the whole world.

141
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,416
Studying seems like
a selfish thing to do

142
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,958
when I could be working
towards the betterment

143
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,625
of all mankind.

144
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,416
There is a much
faster way to do things.

145
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,375
Is there something
you need to learn?

146
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,208
Of course there is.
There's so much.

147
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,333
[sighs]

148
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,458
But the best way
to learn is to watch.

149
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,041
And I suppose that's what
today is all about, isn't it?

150
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,250
Observing.

151
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,250
If there is something
that you need to learn,

152
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,958
then simply use
the Pandora Device.

153
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,083
[NENE]
Like I said,

154
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,791
I've helped out with
research in the past.

155
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,416
But I don't have any experience
with full or part time work.

156
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,625
What about you, Cla-ring?

157
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,166
Have you ever held a job before?

158
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,125
Yes. Right now.

159
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:18,250
Always being by Nene's
side is Clarion's job.

160
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,625
[NENE]
Uh...

161
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,500
For it to be a job, you
