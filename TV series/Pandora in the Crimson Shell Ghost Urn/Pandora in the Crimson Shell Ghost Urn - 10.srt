163
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,458
You rescued me!

164
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,416
Are you all right, Nene?

165
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,750
[AMY, DAVID laughing]

166
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,791
[DAVID]
Wait for me!

167
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,333
[NENE]
I'm sorry about that.

168
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,833
I guess I just don't
have it together today.

169
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,041
Nene... Did something happen?

170
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,833
You don't seem
like your normal self.

171
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,916
I'm fine. Really.

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,416
It's just...

173
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,583
I feel like I need to learn
to do things on my own.

174
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:44,000
Otherwise, Cla-ring
will end up not liking me.

175
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,208
I don't understand.

176
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,250
Did you do something
to make her dislike you?

177
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,666
[NENE]
No!

178
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,958
It's this.

179
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,166
[ALTMAN]
"Don't get involved."

180
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,875
Do you have any idea what
she might be talking about?

181
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,625
No, not really.

182
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,875
Although, I'm worried
she might be annoyed.

183
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,666
Like she's tired of me
and doesn't want to be

184
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,333
involved with me anymore.

185
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,875
What makes you think that, Nene?

186
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,375
I'm not sure.

187
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,291
I guess it's because
I don't know

188
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,375
how to do anything without her.

189
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,000
I bet that's not true.

190
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,333
Is Cla-ring the kind of girl
who would dislike you

191
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,458
for needing her help?

192
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,208
No, not at all!

193
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:25,000
It's just... I'm tired of having
to rely on everyone else

194
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,458
all the time.

195
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,958
[NENE] I've felt helpless
since the beginning.

196
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,625
And now...

197
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:36,250
I depend on Cla-ring
to get me through the day.

198
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,250
I need to be able to
get things done for myself!

199
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,416
[ALTMAN] Do you think if you
become totally self-sufficient,

200
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Cla-ring will want to be
involved with you again?

201
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,458
What do you think it means to
be involved with someone?

202
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,375
[NENE]
Well... I don't know.

203
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,375
I think it means you
fully trust that person

204
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,291
with everything.

205
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,541
With everything?

206
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,083
[ALTMAN]
Tell me this, Nene.

207
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,166
How would you feel if you found
out Cla-ring was in danger?

208
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,833
I would be worried!

209
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:02,875
[ALTMAN]
Of course.

210
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,708
But if she told you
not to worry.

211
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,958
Would you leave her alone?

212
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,875
No, I would want to help her!

213
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,250
Even though she said
not to get involved?

214
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,333
Yes!

215
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,041
I'd still help Cla-ring,
no matter what!

216
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:14,875
[ALTMAN]
But why?

217
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,125
Why would you help her?

218
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,833
Because I want to.

219
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,958
Because I like her a lot!

220
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:22,958
[laughs]

221
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,500
Everybody is that way.

222
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:25,583
But don't forget...

223
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:26,791
The people you worry about

224
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,500
worry about you
all the time too, Nene.

225
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,625
Do you know how
to get world peace?

226
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:35,750
It's not one person one-sidedly
helping someone else.

227
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:40,333
It'll happen when everyone
helps each other equally.

228
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:43,708
Try your hardest to do what
you're capable of, Nene.

229
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,541
Focus on achieving
things within reach

230
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:49,000
for the people who
matter most to you.

231
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,583
Okay. I will.

232
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:53,958
Hey. I know.

233
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,750
I made a promise to Cla-ring
the other day, Robert!

234
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,416
I swore to her we would
go shopping together!

235
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,875
If you trust her,
then maybe you should

236
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,375
wait for her to get back.

237
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,125
Then you two can go
on your shopping spree!

238
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,291
Right!

239
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,875
[AMY]
Bye bye, Nene!

240
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:10,958
Please come again.

241
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,125
And next time
bring Cla-ring, too!

242
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,375

Thank you very much, Robert.

244
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:16,875
You're the best.

245
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,833
Ah... It's just my nature.

246
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,333
Besides... In reality,
maybe I'm the one

247
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,416
who should be
thanking you, Nene.

248
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,791
[laughs]

249
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,500
[NORTH] Yes, an
urgent matter, you say?

250
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,416
What exactly is this
regarding, Captain Altman?

251
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,958
[ALTMAN] There's something I
need to discuss with you, sir.

252
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,916
It is very important.

253
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,166
What?

254
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,125
[VLIND] Captured by
a mysterious robot army,

255
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,000
I miraculously escaped
despite having been drugged!

256
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,916
Witness my enduring
journalistic spirit

257
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,708
as I fight to bring
these facts to the public,

258
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,875
all while sneaking around a
menacing subterranean empire!

259
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,708
Hello? Hello?

260

[MIC PERSON]
Hey, bartender.

261
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,583
More fish dumplings
and tofu fritters, please.

262
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:09,500
[ROBOT 5A]
You got it.

It's you-know-who again.

265
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:13,708
Yo, yo. What's up?

266
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:14,958
[VLIND]
Hey, it's me!

267
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm... pretty sure I'm...
break... century!

268
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,958
This is... scoop! 

269
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,000
[CAMERA PERSON]
Hm?

270
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,041
[MIC PERSON]
What was that all about?

271
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,458
[CAMERA PERSON]
Who knows?

272
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:25,833
What the heck?

273
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:27,791
[laughs]

274
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,666
Just wait and see.

275
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,291
I will get this scoop
if it's the last thing I do!

276
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:35,666
Who's the world's most loved and
respected journalist slash idol?

277
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,416
It's Vli--

[screaming]

279
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,750
All right!

280
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:49,958
[CDF SUBORDINATE 10A]
An emergency summons

281
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,291
by Captain Altman?

282
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,333
[KOYASU] He even called
in off-duty members.

283
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,666
[CDF SUBORDINATE 10B]
What's going on?

284
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,083
[ALTMAN]
Officers!

285
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,833
We're about to search the
American Imperial compound!

286
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,125
[ALL]
Huh?

287
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,625
I'll explain all the
details in just a moment.

288
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,625
But to be clear,
Cenancle Island's peace

289
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,541
depends on this search!

290
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:13,583
Captain.

291
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,791
We have a legal
basis worked out.

292
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,000
But politically,
it'll be tricky.

293
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,041
So I won't order you to do this.

294
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,791
But I am asking you
with all of my heart.

295
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,791
I want you to help me do this,

296
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,875
for the sake of peace
on this island!

Sir! Yes, sir!

We've been waiting to hear those
words for a long time, Captain!

We're ready when you are!

Let's teach them a lesson, sir!

I told you,
it isn't an order!

Sir! Yes, sir!

and ready for Cla-ring
to come home any moment now!

Welcome back, Cla-ring!

310
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,291
You must be exhausted.

311
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,500
Would you like to charge?

312
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,208
Or do some maintenance perhaps?

313
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,583
Looking good there.

[NENE laughs]

315

I worked really hard
to clean the place up

for you, Cla-ring!

Not the place, Nene.

Come on. I'll let you
touch my ears.

323
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,208
You sure?

324
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,250
[NENE] I love your ears.
They feel so nice.

325
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,875
Scratchy, scratch, scratch.

326
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,166
Oh, yeah. That's nice, right?

327
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,666
You want more? Scratchy scratch.

328
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,083
Wait a sec...

329
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,416
[BUER] You're late! Late!
Dark! Cramped!

330
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,333
Oh, how I loathe
the bitter darkness!

331
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:59,291
[NENE] I'm sorry.
I forgot about you.

332
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,916
[BUER]
A cruel angel's thesis!

333
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,208
There are not maidens enough
to heal this damaged soul!

334
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,458
Not enough, indeed!

335
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,583
I cannot persist!

336
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,083
To quote Goethe, "More maidens!"

337
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,500
Cla-ring's out running
an errand right now.

338
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,625
[BUER]
Aye! That I know...

339
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,583
By all accounts, she hath
snuck into the Geofront

340
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,500
in order to stop
my body from rampaging

341
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,083
and wreaking havoc
on the island!

342
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,125
[NENE]
Huh?

343
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,083
Quick, puppet!
Dodge that, yeah!

344
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,000
That's not optical camouflage.

345
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,166
It's thermo-optical camo, yeah!

346
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,208
But not even my companies
or the long-established

347
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,833
Kyo-Re have implemented
that tech yet. Incredible!

348
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,166
[TAKUMI]
Watch out for his claws yeah!

349
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,791
Your opponent has military-grade
cyborg arms, yeah!

350
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,916
They were easily able to
destroy Shinokaomi's armor!

351
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,833
Don't even think about trying
to block them head-on, puppet!

352
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,000
[KURTZ]
Not bad, I have to say.

353
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,916
There was a time when I
would've wanted to obtain it

354
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,125
unscathed even
if it took some doing,

355
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,916
but now the plan is
already in its final stage.

356
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,208
I know that wasting time
is something only fools do.

357
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,833
No matter. I permit
you to destroy it.

358
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,541
Oh, wow! He's super fast.

359
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,958
With that kind of mobility, just
how mechanized is this guy?

360
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,750
[TAKUMI]
This is bad!

361
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:32,333
[TAKUMI]
Puppet!

362
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,333
[KURTZ]
What?

363
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,958
[BUNNY]
Come on, snap out of it!

364
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,833
This is no time
to be unconscious!

365
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,750
If I can't make myself
useful to the colonel,

366
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,500
my friends and I will
be dead meat for sure!

367
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,000
[TAKUMI]
Hey, puppet!

368
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,750
That's no cyborg!
It's an android, yeah!

369
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,833
It transformed, yeah? Oh no!

370
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,791
Hold on...
We're not losing ground!

371
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,041
This'll work, yeah!

372
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,875
Da ta da!

373
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,166
I've got your back,
Colonel Kurtz!

374
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,791
[BUNNY] So the plan is
we kick her butt, right?

375
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,041
I can help!

376
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,416
I might not look it,
but I can handle myself!

377
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,875
What the heck?

378
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,083
[TAKUMI]
Don't kill anyone, yeah!

379
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,541
[TAKUMI gasps]

380
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,541
The game's over.

381
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,291
[TAKUMI] I won't let the
puppet's death be in vain.

382
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,750
[NENE]
I'm gonna go find my friend!

383
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,750
Cla-ring. Sorry,
but I'm getting involved!

384
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,166
[BUER]
I'll go too!

385
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,583
Okay, I'll go let Takumi know.

386
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,708
[BUER] Wait, you
far-too-innocent maiden.

387
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,250
[BUER] The lady who
harboreth that flat,

388
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,583
limitless plane upon herself
is most busy at present.

389
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,041
I didn't realize.

390
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,166
[BUER] Therefore,
I suggest you leave a note.

391
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,541
[NENE]
So, um... I hold you like this?

392
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,791
[BUER]
Oh yes!

393
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,541
Grip thy fingers around
me gently, but firmly.

394
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,791
And be careful with
those sharp nails of yours.

395
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,208
That's it.

396
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,291
Now thrust my fifth leg
into the room's terminal port.

397
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:27,541
Oh! Yahoo! Oh wow! Nene!

398
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:31,333
In truth, thou hast
magic haaaaands!

399
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,458
[BUER]
We may go.

400
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,333
Where's Nene?

401
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:43,833
Oh, of course, she's studying.

402
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:47,333
Now then, if I can only
seize control of BUER...

403
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:52,291
[BUER]
Our escape is a massive success.

404
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,875
Here I come, Cla-ring!

405
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,583
[CLARION]
Lovely bride of mine.

406
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,875
I want you to touch my ears
with your beautiful fingers.

407
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:35,125
[NENE]
Oh, Cla-ring!

408
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,250
[CLARION] Nene.
I could be yours for all time.

409
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,875
[NENE squeals]
My Cat Prince Cla-ring!

410
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,166
Stay with me forever!

411
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,833
[NENE] Here I come, Cla-ring!
I'm on my way!

412
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:32,708
[BUER] Spirits that
call to one another,

413
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:34,041
maiden attracted to maiden.

414
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,416
Ah, 'tis sweet drink
for my parched heart!

415
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,416
[NENE] After all,
I'm very fond of Cla-ring!

416
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,541
She's the best!

417
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:42,041
[BUER] 'Tis for this
cupful I do live!
