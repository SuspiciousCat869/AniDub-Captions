First, I took the eagle emblem.

2
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,708
Then I obtained the
silver key from the sewer.

3
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,833
And afterwards,
I moved the model tank.

4
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,000
There.

5
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,666
[BUER] Girl, art thou
done with thy work?

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,833
Yes, sir!

7
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,333
I arranged the paintings
in the break room

00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,083
per your instructions!

Huh?

00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,666
Wow, this is like a video game!

I'm Hanako Dosukoi.
Welcome to Herme's, sir.

Excuse me, Colonel.

[KURTZ]
What is it?

46
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,541
We received a report
of an intruder

47
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,791
inside the facility, sir.

48

visit our food court.

[KURTZ]
Intruder?

00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,125
[SECURITY CHIEF]
Yes!

51
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,583
It was a suspicious android

52
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,875
dressed in a schoolgirls'
uniform, sir.

53
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,291
May I go ahead and conduct
a thorough search?

54
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,708
[KURTZ]
There's no need.

55
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,041
It's under control.

00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,083

Dispose of this one.

59
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,541
The soldiers spotted it.

60
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,458
Apparently, it was
wandering around.

61
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,500
Are you sure about this?

62
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,291
It looks like a high
quality android.

63
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,708
Just do it.

64
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,458
We cannot let our country
find out what we're up to,

65
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,916
which means we have to
exercise extreme caution.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,166
I'm sorry for
questioning you, Colonel!

67
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,208
[KURTZ] There are many
fools in this world.

68
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,583
Far too many.

69
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,166
Those who are superior
must control them.

Yes... It is up to us.

Are you all right?

75
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,250
Wait a second.

76
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,041
Have we met somewhere before?

77
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,458
--Yeah, It's me!
--Oh, right!

[NENE] What are you doing
in a place like this?

81
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,666
[BUNNY] I got tossed
out with the garbage.

82
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,583
[sighs] I suppose this
is the end of the line.

83
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:14,458
And I have to spend my final
moments with a freakin' android.

84
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,666
Actually, I'm a human.

85
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,958
People make that
mistake all the time.

86
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:22,125
Full cyborg? Oh, wow.

87
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,625
[BUNNY] Everything's
mechanized but the braincase.

88
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,000
It's only worked a
few times, worldwide.

89
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,333
[gasps]

90
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,458
Hold on. That means you've
been cyberized, right?

91
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,916
I have!

92
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,666
[BUNNY] I tried creating
a make shift terminal

93
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,416
with the parts available here.

94
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,333
If we can use this set-up to
access the base's system...

95
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,166
We'll be able to get outta here.

96
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,000
Unfortunately,
it was a rush job.

97
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,791
Relax, things'll
work out for us.

98
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:45,625
Huh?

99
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,708
I'm going to reach Cla-ring,

are in my way!

I have to succeed, too.

102
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,000
My friends need me.

103
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,375
Ah. Let's get started!

104
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,541
[NENE]
Okay!

105
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,416
[BUNNY]
All right.

106
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,208
You only have to do one thing:

107
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,625
Get into the base's system,

108
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,916
and once you're inside,
release the lock on the hatch.

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,083
[NENE]
Understood.

110

Here we go!

111
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,083
[BUNNY]
So, can you hear me?

112
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,666
[NENE]
Yes! Loud and clear!

113
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,958
But it's totally weird because
I can't see myself, not one bit!

114
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,750
[BUNNY]
Well, you're in cyberspace.

115
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,458
If you don't configure yourself,
you can't perceive anything.

116
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,333
There's an avatar
there I created.

117
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,375
Activate it now.

118
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,666
[NENE]
I'm sorry. I don't see it.

119
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,125
Come on!

120
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,583
Anything will do, so just
hurry up and find an avatar!

121
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,458
If you remain in
a flat state for too long,

122
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,583
then your mind is
totally going to collapse!

123
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,625
[NENE] Oh, okay.
I'm working on it, now!

124
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,333
[BUNNY]
Hey! Are you all right?

125
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,583
[NENE]
Yeah, I'm fine.

126
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,875
The thing is, I can't
see anything around me.

127
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,958
[BUNNY] Well, that's
pretty typical, actually.

128
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,208
Humans can't perceive
the flow of data, Nene.

129
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,541
But don't worry, I promise
everything'll be all right.

130
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,791
Whatever you do, just don't
go outside the terrarium,

131
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,000
you understand me?

132
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,416
Wait, why not?

133
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,875
[BUNNY] Because you'll
lose track of yourself

134
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,041
in the sea of information,

135
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,583
and you won't be
able to get back.

136
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,333
See the arrow that
just showed up?

137
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:23,583
That's your navigator.

138
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:24,750
Follow it, Nene!

139
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,083
[NENE]
Okay!

140
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,708
[BUNNY] It'll lead you to
the base's configdata.

141
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,875
--It's so cute!
--[BUNNY] What're you doing?!

142
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,875
That's a military
barrier program!

143
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,166
Do not touch it!

144
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,083
[NENE]
Wow! There are so many!

145
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,000
[BUNNY] They're wandering
around all over the place,

146
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,083
so be careful!

147
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,291
[NENE]
Hey, Bunny?

148
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,000
Can I maybe go a
different way or something?

149
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,750
[BUNNY] You have to follow
the navigation route.

150
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,666
What you're doing is
like wearing a diving suit

151
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,541
and moving through the
dark depths of the ocean.

152
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,875
Do not go anywhere outside
the navigation route

153
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,583
or you're toast, you got it?!

154
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,958
[NENE]
Yes, ma'am!

155
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,750
Can she actually do this...?

156
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,916
It's got me feeling
really anxious...

157
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,125
[alarm sounds]

158
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,833
Hell's lid is opening, Nene!

159
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,291
Hop! Hop! Hop!

160
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,833
This is kinda fun since
it's like a video game.

161
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,250
But I don't think
I'm making much progress.

162
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,750
[BUNNY]
Whatever you do,

163
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,416
just don't go outside the
terrarium, you understand me?

164
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,166
[NENE] I wonder if there's
a way I can take a shortcut.

165
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,250
Ah! No! Help! [sobs]

166
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,541
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

167
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,666
This is bad! We're gonna die!

168
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,416
Please! Hurry up!

169
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:41,291
[BUNNY]
She's stopped!

170
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,791
What the heck is she doing?

171
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,916
[NENE] I'm there,
but I don't understand.

172
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,458
Just like back then.

173
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:50,875
[TECHNICIAN]
Can you hear me?

174
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,000
I need you to forget how
you moved your original body.

175
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:57,333
Try to focus on the parts
you never had before.

176
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,958
[NENE]
I don't get it.

177
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,250
[TECHNICIAN] Well, like wagging
your tail, for example.

178
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,583
[NENE] I hear you,
but I don't understand.

179
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,833
[TECHNICIAN]
Or flapping your wings, perhaps?

180
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,458
[NENE] I think it's best if I
think back to the beginning...

181
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:11,208
Not this beginning, but the
beginning of all beginnings.

182
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,666
When I was a little baby.

183
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,166
You know, like the first
time you figure out

184
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,416
you can move your own body.

185
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,833
[NENE]
I did it!

186
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,583
[NENE] Like seeing or hearing
something for the first time.

187
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,041
[NENE]
Lots of sparkling things.

188
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:53,208
So near and yet, so far away.

189
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,625
What is this?

190
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:58,333
So much is visible all at once,
yet I understand it all.

191
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:01,583
[BUER] Hmm? I sense
the maiden's presence!

192
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,916
[NENE]
I can feel Cla-ring...

193
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,791
Wait for me!
I'll come see you soon!

194
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:11,000
Even if she truly doesn't want
me to be worried about her,

195
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,625
if Cla-ring is in trouble,

196
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,416
then I want to share
in her troubles with her!

197
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,375
After all, she's the first
friend like me I've met

198
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,208
in the entire world!

199
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,708
[BUNNY]
We're gonna die!

200
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,333
I'm sorry, my friends!

201
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,791
I have failed you all...

202
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,291
[NENE]
Oh, that's right!

203
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,416
Wow! It reset!

204
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,791
She did it!

205
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,166
You got there in time!

206
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,208
You kick some
serious butt, Nene!

207
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,500
[BUNNY]
Hooray! Hooray!

208
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,166
[laughs]

209
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,166
[BUNNY]
Are you awake now?

210
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,583
[NENE]
Yes.

211
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,208
The emergency hatch opened, too.
Let's get out of here.

212
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,416
[NENE]
Oh, Bunny!

213
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,958
Didn't you hear what
I said earlier, Nene?

214
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,250
My name's not Bunny!

215
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,708
Oh, well. Not that
it really matters.

216
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,291
I'm super impressed with you.

217
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,875
I've never seen a terrarium as
incredible as that one before!

218
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,583
[BUNNY]
Huh? For real?

219
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,375
Well, you know, I do happen to
be one of the best engineers

220
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,791
on Cenancle Island!

221
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,125
Hands down!

222
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,500
[NENE]
Come on, Bunny. Let's go!

223
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,750
Or maybe I'm lucky.

224
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,166
Even I'm surprised
I pulled it off

225
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,083
using that big pile of garbage.

226
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,666
Hmm?

227
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,333
[BUNNY]
The cord's broken?

228
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,833
Then it was never even
connected to the network?

229
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,208
But if that's true, how did
she perceive the terrarium

230
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,458
and her avatar correctly?
That doesn't make sense.

231
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,291
How was she able to operate
the base's system?

232
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,166
Well, if we're going,
we better move now!

233
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,083
[BUNNY]
This girl...

234
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,208
What the heck is she anyway?

235
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,958
Hi. To all my loyal
and amazing fans,

236
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,291
I'm so sorry to have kept
you waiting like this!

237
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,833
What you're currently
looking at is a

238
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,583
super-duper-top-secrret facility
right underneath your feet,

239
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,250
just beneath the
harbor district!

240
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,375
They told you it was
a bedrock collapse.

241
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,750
But the real cause of the most
recent incident of terrorism

242
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,583
appears to stem from an ongoing
conspiracy somehow connected to

243
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,291
this dubious underground
lair in which I'm standing!

244
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,750
You have my word-- I will not
stop till the truth is out!

245
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,291
Coming to you live from
the depths of the island,

246
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,000
it's the world's most trusted
reporter, the one and only--

I'm so sorry we're late.

250
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,375
[NENE]
Cla-ring, Here I come!

251
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,708
[yells] Awaken, you hidden
power that sleeps within me

252
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,791
yearning to be unleashed! Ahh...

253
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,333
Nene, let's use the door.

254
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,375
[laughs nervously]

255
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,125
I gotta go rescue all my friends
from their impending doom.

256
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,416
This is where we part.

257
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,416
[NENE]
Okay!

258
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,708
And I'm going to
go find Cla-ring!

259
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,208
Wait! Hold on!

260
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,291
[BUNNY]
Here.

261
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,833
[NENE]
Hey, that's Cla-ring's!

262
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,166
[BUNNY]
Yeah. I was looking after it.

263
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,875
I'll give it back
as soon as I find her.

264
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,750
[BUNNY]
Please do.

265
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,875
[NENE]
Thanks!

266
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,083
[BUNNY]
How do I tell her?

267
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,458
Can I tell her?

268
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,333
She gave up her
life to save mine.

269
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,333
She's already dead!

270

[SUBORDINATES]
Yes, sir!

00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:11,958
If successful, this

[BUER]
What nerve!

319
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,916
[SUBORDINATE 9B] Sir! Successful
purge of BUER's barriers!

320
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,625
[SUBORDINATE 9C]
Colonel! BUER is reconstructing

321
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,291
its barrier method and deploying
multiple false entries!

322
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,708
[SUBORDINATE 9B]
Barrier method analyzed!

They're being vaccinated!
Trojans are deploying!

[SUBORDINATE 9C] Barrier code
switching to mob rule, sir!

325
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,500
Analysis has become
far more difficult!

326
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

--Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

[BUER] 'Tis getting
me nowhere and fast!

329
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,125
In that case, target
the meddler's pawns!

330
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:59,458
I shall blow every last one of
them off the face of the Earth!

331
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,875
[SUBORDINATE 9B] Detecting a

It's the particle cannon!

333
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,000
I won't let you!

I'll crush Uzal's BUER

Fourth barrier, penetrated!

Approximately one hour

00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,250
until BUER is completely
under our control, Colonel!

345
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,291
It appears the plan will be
carried out without disruption.

346
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,333
Soon, we'll be in control
of the whole world

347
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,791
and no one can stop us.

348
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,125
The future is ours, gentlemen!

349
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,500
Hey, Cla-ring. Where are you?

350
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,041
It's me, Nene!

351
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,625
Colonel Kurtz, I am detecting
an intruder near BUER.

352
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,375
Let me see it on the monitor.

353
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,333
It's me, Cla-ring.
Where are you?

354
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,458
[KURTZ]
That's the one from earlier.

355
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,541
Time to find out
what's going on here.

356
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,583
Greetings, successor
of Sahar Schehera.

357
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,375
So, we meet again.

358
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,583
[NENE]
You're huge!

359
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,250
[KURTZ] You and the
cat-eared combat robot

360
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,125
wouldn't make me
think twice, normally.

361
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,916
But then, with Sahar,
appearances can be deceiving.

362
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,958
Cat ears? Do you know
where Cla-ring is, Mister?

363
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,666
Unfortunately, you're a
bit too late, my dear.

364
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,208
Sorry to disappoint.

365
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,375
BUER is already
in my possession.

366
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,708
Do you know what makes
BUER so valuable?

367
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,958
Its particle cannon!

368
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,875
A super-weapon that
surpasses nukes,

369
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,458
it can attack entire cities

370
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,541
without risk of
treaty violation.

371
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,000
The world is a
rotten place, indeed.

372
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,833
Impoverished nations
prey upon the weak.

373
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,791
It leads to nothing but
disorder and chaos.

374
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,541
I detest that more
than anything else.

375
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,833
Arrogance, envy, wrath,

376
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,708
depravity, greed,
gluttony, lust...

377
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,125
The fundamental
seeds of conflict

378
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,375
will never go away
while these thrive.

379
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,708
That is the great
weakness of mankind.

380
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,833
This is why the world
needs a single controller,

381
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,250
someone to rule over it all!

382
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,000
A group with supreme
military strength

383
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,458
to strangle this
growing depravity.

384
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,291
Order is the ideal beauty!

385
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:10,250
Poseidon is that entity.
And we will establish peace!

386
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,833
[NENE]
Huh?

387
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:15,166
[KURTZ] Stand with me, Sahar's
successor, and come to our side.

388
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,291
You have my word,
I'll use your technology

389
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,083
for the sake of World Peace.

390
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,791
We will rule the foolish masses

391
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,500
with true order born
out of pure fear.

392
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,500
You don't have to do something
scary like that, Mister.

393
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,583
That right?

394
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,458
[NENE]
After all, you can always just

395
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,041
purchase world peace
with money, right?

396
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:37,291
[chuckles]

397
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,458
[NENE] By the way, about
my good friend Cla-ring...

398
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,875
She's a cute little girl in a
dress with cat ears and--

399
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,166
Are you making fun of
me right now, droid?!

--Don't you realize fools

--Ah, no. Sir, please, don't...

404

--into chaos and disorder?!
--Ah, no. Sir, please, don't...

405
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,875
Yeah, but... Cla-ring!

406
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,666
I've had enough.
You're a waste of time.

407
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,583
You can send in all
the puppets you like,

408
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,583
but it won't matter in the end.

409
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,416
[gasps]

410
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,833
Wait a second.
That's Cla-ring's.

411
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,166
[KURTZ]
She fought hard,

412
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,416
but when it was over,
that's all that remained.

413
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,416
Please, take it.

414
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,833
[KURTZ] I can certainly
promise you this much.

415
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,208
You're going to
regret insulting me.

416
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,583
[KURTZ]
Goodbye.

417
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:32,625
[NENE whimpers]

418
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,666
[NENE gasps]

419
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,500
Nene. Are you all right?

420
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,708
Insane...

421
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,166
That was a direct hit
and it didn't even

422
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,583
--leave a single scratch?!
--Cla-ring!

423
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,333
--And somehow, the cat-eared bot
--We're together again!

424
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,750
--managed to revive itself
--Oh, thank goodness

425
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,166
--and evade our system.
--you're still alive, Cla-ring!

426
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,666
--I underestimated Sahar
--Nene, what are you doing here?

427
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,833
--yet again.
--Nene, what are you doing here?

428
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,083
I'm here so I can
rescue you from danger!

429
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,333
Cla-ring. Cla-ring!

430
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,875
We should go now. And quickly.

431
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,541
It's not safe. You ready?

432
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,125
No, I can't leave yet.

433
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,000
What?

434
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,250
Tell me you're joking, Cla-ring.

435
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,416
Come on, we should go to
the hospital right away.

436
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,250
Sorry, I can't leave.

437
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,958
Incidents have been
occurring on the island

438
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,375
because there are
people going after BUER.

439
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,791
If Clarion does not stop
this once and for all,

440
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,166
Cenancle Island
will never be safe.

441
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,916
Oh, so that's it then.

442
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,750
In that case, I'll help you!

443
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,333
I cannot get you involved--

444
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,333
You know what?

445
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,500
I know I haven't lived
on this island for long,

446
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,833
but it feels like home to me.

447
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,500
[NENE]
I've met all sorts of people.

448
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,416
And I've made lots
of fun memories.

449
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,666
Every moment has been so
much more fun and rewarding

450
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,291
than when I was on
the hospital ward.

451
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,291
I like this island so much.

452
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,458
And I absolutely adore
everyone on it!

453
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,666
[gasps]

454
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,791
That's why I have to
protect it, Cla-ring!

455
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,375
Please, just let me help!

456
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,750
To be completely honest.

457
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,208
When I first saw that
note you left for me,

458
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,500
I was a little bit
shocked to say the least.

459
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,083
We were together all the time,

460
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,458
but you know,
I'm me, and you're you.

461
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,000
We're not the same being.

462
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,875
We're separate, and we
think different things,

463
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,208
and that's okay.

464
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,083
I want us to be
together. So badly.

465
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,500
Me, too. But see--

466
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,875
Yeah, I understand.

467
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,041
You're just concerned
for my well-being.

468
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,500
You did everything
you could by yourself

469
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,541
so I wouldn't get involved.

470
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,750
I'm so sorry I wasn't
able to see it, Cla-ring.

471
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,250
But this time, it's
my turn to help out.

472
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:32,416
I want to do my best for
your sake, all right?

473
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,625
Nene...

474
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,750
[NENE] To me, you're
the most special person

475
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,916
in the whole world.

476
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,250
[NENE]
You know what?

477
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,750
I just want you to
discover something

478
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,791
that really matters to you.

479
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,458
Something that matters.

480
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,583
[NENE]
Hm? What's that?

481
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,875
Oh, never mind.

482
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,666
--[KURTZ] Sahar's successor.
--All right.

483
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,458
It would be a shame to lose
your technical prowess.

484
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,833
But so be it.

485
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,666
Let's fight. Now.

486
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,375
Yeah!

487
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,958
[NENE]
If you and I are together,

488
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,875
then nothing can
stand in our way!

489
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,750
Nene, I have complete
faith in you.

490
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,916
[NENE]
Pandora Device...

491
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,375
...open!

492
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,208
--[SUBORDINATES gasping]
--She transformed.

493
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:35,541
But how?

494
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,500
So, you wanna make
a fool out of me?

495
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:40,750
With this vile and
deplorable behavior?

496
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,875
Forgive my lack of manners.

497
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:46,125
I've yet to introduce
my creation.

498
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:49,083
His name is Fear.

499
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:52,000
If you're wondering why
I chose that particular moniker,

500
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:55,166
allow me to give you
a proper demonstration.

501
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,791
Seize them, Fear.

502
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,333
Oh, Cla-ring. Are you hurt?

503
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:31,625
Were you scared?

504
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,125
[CLARION] It doesn't hurt,
and I'm not scared.

505
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,250
I will stop BUER and
protect you. End of story.

506
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,541
You are so strong!

507
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,916
I'll help you stop the bad guys.

508
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,250
Let's fight them together!

509
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,375
[CLARION]
All right.

510
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,875
[CLARION] We'll eliminate
the obstacles in our path

511
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,083
and stop BUER.

512
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:34,041
[NENE]
For the sake of peace, right?

513
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:34,833
[CLARION]
Right.

514
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:36,333
[NENE]
Let's go!

515
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:38,708
If you and I stick together,
we can do anything we want!

516
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:41,208
[CLARION] Nene, I have
complete faith in you.
