Yes, of course!
It's more than okay.

had the prudent idea

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,375
to install high-level
disaster countermeasures.

141

[TAKUMI] Naturally there's
plenty of emergency power.

What's more, the

146
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,958
is primarily wired,
so we can continue

the exact level of
strength you intend to.

I'm using a collection

162
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,958
there's a little bit too much
leeway in your base output.

163
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,708
So I have the ability to
exert superhuman strength?

164
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,916
[TOTO] Well, yes, but we're
adjusting it so that you won't.

165
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,250
Aside from being impractical,

166
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,625
that level of strength
could be dangerous.

167
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,458
On the other hand, applying
limiters isn't good, either.

168
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,875
[NENE laughs]

169
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,083
The brains of all living things,
both people and animals,

170
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,416
frequently issue
behavioral commands

171
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,916
that don't take
into account the body's

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,291
actual structural strength,

173
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,833
and then of course,
it quickly applies the brakes.

174
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,458
But if we were to release torque
every time that happens...

175
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,666
He just wants you
to be normal, dear.

176
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,375
You don't want your friends
to call you Gorilla Girl, right?

177
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,750
I don't know.
I think gorillas are cute.

178
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,708
Not that I've ever
seen a real one before.

179
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,083
[TOTO] As a result, we must 
create appropriate safeguards.

Stop it. Be quiet, Lean!

Hello?

00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,833
[BUER]
This box of terror is naught

200
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,625
compared to the
icy prison of Cocytus!

201
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,208
There's a tiny thing inside.

202
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,666
[BUER]
I am not tiny!

203
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,208
My name is BUER.

204
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,916
And I am a philosopher of Hades.

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,541
A philosopher?

206
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,583
[BUER]
Indeed.

207
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:34,750
What a weird petroid.

208
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,416
I wonder if someone
left it behind.

209
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,041
[BUER]
I am no one's possession!

210
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,375
But I thank thee sincerely
for liberating me, dainty lady.

211
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,875
You're very kind.

212
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,041
Oh. You're very welcome.

00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,000
[BUER]
Muah!

214
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:54,500
I don't have time to pal
around with this tiny thingy!

215
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,541
Lean! He could be anywhere!

216
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,791
[BUER]
BUER!

217
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,708
I would have thee
call me that, dainty lady.

218
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,000
Now. Tell me, who is Lean?

219
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,125
Lean is a kitten.

220
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,875
I told him not to but he
followed me here anyway.

221
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,000
[BUER]
A-ha!

222
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,125
You see, pets aren't
allowed in the hospital.

223
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,166
It'll be a disaster
if one of the employees

224

finds him wandering around.

225
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,708
So I need to make sure
I get to him first!

226
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,166
[BUER]
Aye, I understand thy plight!

What is the matter?

brought Lean here with me,

forgive me for it!

be troubled by such things.

Thou shalt recover all
that thou holdest dear.

Tell me, dainty lady...

257
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,791
Does this stray creature we
seek not have a tracking device?

258
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,458

Like the ones for pets?

I lost track of Lean again!

306
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,791
[BUER] Grievest not,
dear dainty lady.

307
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:11,208
Truly, what hardship can
there be with BUER by thy side?

308
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,250
Wah!

309
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,833
[AMY] Thanks for
helping out, tiny guy.

310
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,541
Just as soon as we find Lean,

311
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,708
we'll go find your owner,
no matter how long it takes.

312
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:26,958
[BUER]
If you are willing,

313
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,125
I would not be averse
to frolicking by thy side

314
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,625
a while longer.

315
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,041
Why don't you wanna go back?

316
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,791
Do you get bullied at home?

317
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,708
[BUER]
Nay, I am not bullied!

318
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,416
[laughs nervously]

319
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,708
Nothing can bind me,
the demon king.

320
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,500
But 'tis nice to visit
the human world occasionally.

321
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,083
[laughs nervously]

322
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,333
[BUER] Hast thou come to this
establishment for treatment,

323
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,083
dainty lady?

324
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,625
Uh-huh!

325
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,583
This leg's only temporary.

326
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,875
I'm getting it switched
for a brand new one today.

327
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,125
[BUER]
A-ha!

328
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,583
[AMY] I can't wait to see
what my new leg looks like!

329
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:00,916
That's why I wore this dress!

330
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,375
'Cause Grandma thinks
it'll be a perfect match!

331
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,416
[BUER]
So sweet.

332
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,208
Her childlike innocence
alights inside my once dark

333
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,541
and bitter heart!

334
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,833
My dear dainty lady!

335
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,000
You look lovely!

336
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,416
That outfit brings
out thy life's glow!

337
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,083
[NENE]
Oh! There's BUER!

338
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,541
[BUER]
Ah! Sweet Maiden!

339
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,583
This reunion is an
inevitability of...

340
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:28,750
[BUER]
...fate.

341
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,750
Is she your owner,
tiny guy? Hello.

342
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,333
[BUER]
Sweet Maiden!

343
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:41,250
Do not forget to admire me as--

344
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,166
[ANNA] Well, well!
If it isn't Nene and Clarion!

345
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:46,791
[AMY]
Lean!

346
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,416
[ANNA] Oh!
Does this kitty belong to you?

347
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,541
[LEAN meows]

348
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,083
[ANNA] I was exploring
the hospital grounds

349
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,583
when I came across her cat.

350
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,041
[NENE] But I thought
you had been released?

351
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,083
[ANNA] The doctors were
concerned about the recurring

352
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,416
network disturbances.

353
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,125
So they asked me
to stay for a few days

354
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,250
in case there are issues.

355
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,583
[PA chimes]

[PA 6A] Paging Amy Gilliam.
Paging Amy Gilliam.

357
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,875
Please come to
examination room 3.

358
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,500
[NENE]
It's time for your checkup.

359
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:16,333
All right!

360
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,583
And don't worry, my dear.

361
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:18,958
We'll watch your cat for you.

362
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,416
[AMY]
Mm-hmm!

363
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,791
[NENE] Amy, you
shouldn't run like that

364
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,000
on the hospital grounds.

365
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,833
You might... fall down...

366
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,041
[NENE]
Aw, Amy!

367
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,500
Oh no! This is a total disaster!

368
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,250
I can't go see Dr. Toto
looking like this!

369
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,000
Why don't we borrow
a hospital robe for now

370
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,208
and get you covered up!

371
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,458
[cries]

372
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,916
I won't wear anything
but my special dress!

373
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,416
[AMY crying]

374
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,625
I usually keep a sewing
kit handy just in case,

375
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:47,000
but I doubt it can be fixed
in such a short amount of time.

376
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,708
[BUER]
There is another way.

377
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,208
Oh! Good call!

378
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,250
[NENE]
Okay, Amy.

379
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,791
You stay right here.

380
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,875
And remember, no peeking!

00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,750
[AMY]
Sure.

387
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,541
It's as good as new.

388
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,791
Wow!

389
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,375

Oh, wow! Wow, wow, wow!

391
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,958
Thank you for
saving the day, Nene!

392
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,708

Look, I'm all done!

[laughing]

394
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,916
[NENE] Oh. So you live at
that big camp in the park?

[AMY]
Yes!

396
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,458
Thanks for walking
me back, Nene.

397
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,500
That's sweet of you.

398
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,416
It's no problem.

399
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,541
You too, Cla-ring.

400
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,750
It's Clarion.

401
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,875
[BUER]
Hast not thou forgotten someone?

402
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,666
And thank you,
as well, tiny guy.

403
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,291
[BUER]
I am not "tiny guy." I'm BUER!

404
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,291
[NENE]
What is this?

405
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,958
[AMY]
This can't be...

406
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,375
[AMY]
Grandma...

407
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,833
[crying]

408
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,208
Grandma's gone and
everyone else is too!

409
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,833
Where did they go?

410
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,958

It'll be all right, Amy.

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,166
Yes, it's Amy! Where are you?

414
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,750
All right. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

415
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,708
Uh-huh, okay.

416
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,166
Yes, I understand. Bye, Grandma.

417
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,416
Is she okay?

418
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,541
[AMY]
Yeah.

419
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,416
She said some
officials from the CDF

420
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,333
paid them a visit and forced
everybody to clear the area.

421
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,916
[NENE]
Where are they now?

422
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,541
Uh... Here.

423
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,083
I know where that is, Amy!

424
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,416
We can take you there.

425
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,666
For real?

[NENE]
Come on, Cla-ring, let's go!

428
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,833
[AMY]
Let's go, Cla-ring!

429
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:09,083
I can't wait to tell Grandma the
story of how you fixed my dress!

430
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,250
[NENE]
Yeah! That'll be fun!

431
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:34,875
[NENE]
You better catch up, Cla-ring!

432
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,333
[AMY]
Catch up, Cla-ring!

433
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:37,708

Last one there's a rotten egg!

435
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,333
[BUER]
What an embrace!

436
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:47,625
A tower hath been erected on
the tropical island of my--

437
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:51,708
[NENE]
Huh?

438
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,791
What was BUER so
excited about back there?

439
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,500
Please don't pay
attention to that moron.

440
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,083
I wonder if that tower is real.

441
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,250
We should take a trip there!

442
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,500
We could watch the
sunset from the tiptop!

443
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,125
I think BUER had a different
kind of tower in mind.

444
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:30,458
[BUER]
I am BUER the demon king,

[AMY]
What are you, a lion?

447
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,333
[BUER] I'm endowed with
the head of the lion,

448
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:35,541
five limbs of the goat,

449
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:37,041
and eternal knowledge
of time and space!

450
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:39,250
[AMY] That tiny front leg
of yours is really cute!

451
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,500
[BUER]
It's not tiny!
