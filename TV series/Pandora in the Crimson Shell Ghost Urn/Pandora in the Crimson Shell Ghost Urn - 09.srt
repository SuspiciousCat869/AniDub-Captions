I know we were told
it's not our concern.

But aren't you the least
bit curious who Clarion is?

Well... Who can say?

00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,125
[TAKUMI groans]

162
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,708
The terrorism
and network outages

163
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,333
are destabilizing
currency, yeah.

164
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,250
What's more, the
American Imperial Army's

165
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,333
advisory group is putting
pressure on every issue!

166
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,375
I bet I know what
they're after, yeah.

167
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,833
[TAKUMI] I figured you were
going to show up eventually...

168
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,625
Uzal's puppet.

169
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,958
So this is about BUER, yeah?

170
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,500
[VLIND]
Ugh!

171
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,750
Somehow I managed to
survive all that uproar

172
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:06,833
with the fire.

173
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,458
But things got weird!

174
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,625
This isn't the idol
I wanted to be!

175
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,041
I thought I'd get
away from everything

176
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,291
and hide out for a while
in the refugee camp.

177
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,750
But as it turns out,
it's no longer there!

178
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,958
Is it possible my
information's out of date?

179
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:19,875
No, it couldn't be...

180
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,291
[rumbling]

181
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,583
What the heck?

182
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,250
Run for your lives!

183
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,458
[screaming]

184
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,083
[VLIND]
Huh? This is a major scoop!

185
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,708
What did I venture to this
island for if not to become

186
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,041
the most famous TV
personality in the world?

187
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,083
Now, I need to gather my team!

188
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,791
[VOICEMAIL] Hello. You have
reached your voicemail service.

189
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,166
Fine. I'll do this alone!
Without them!

190
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,791
That's right! I'm back again!

191
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,500
The world's most trusted
news reporter! Vli--

192
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,041
Where'd she go to?

193
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,666
It's not like her
to just disappear.

194
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,041
[MIC PERSON]
Hey, check it out.

195
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,208
It looks like she
called not too long ago.

196
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,500
[SOLDIER 9A]
Is this a delivery?

197
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,375
Hey! Are you listening?

198
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,625
What's the big deal?

199
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,750
It's probably just more
work machinery, right?

200
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:16,958
[SOLDIER 9A yells]

201
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,833
[OPERATOR 9A]
Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

202
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,750
Incursion by an
unidentified hostile force!

203
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,833
[OPERATOR 9A] All troops,
level one battle-stations!

204
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,583
Details about
hostile force unknown!

205
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,416
Should you make contact, switch
to information-sharing mode.

206
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,958
You're clear to engage.
Weapons free!

207

[OPERATOR 9A]
Intercept! Intercept!

208
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,291
Orders have been issued
for the unconditional

209
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,583
extermination of any trespassers
within this facility!

210
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:13,750
[SOLDIERS yelling]

211
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,541
The enemy force is
a large mobile weapon

212
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,708
with multiple
automated infantry!

213
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,166
Types unknown!

214
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,666
We can't stop them using the
equipment we have on hand!

215
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,625
[SOLDIER 9D]
Get down!

216
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,500
[SOLDIER 9E]
Gas masks on, now!

217
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,625
[COMMANDER 9A]
What the hell is this?

218
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,208
Put me through to
the colonel. Huh?!

219
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,458
[OPERATOR 9A]
Warning!

220
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,666
There's a possibility
this facility's system

221
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,125
is being hacked!

222
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:40,083
[SOLDIER 9D] They're currently
moving from S14E to N14F!

223
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,375
[OPERATOR 9A]
Attention all troops!

224
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,166
Prepare to engage!

225
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,083
[SOLDIER 9E] All right, men,
let's give 'em hell!

226
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,666
[SOLDIER 9F]
Don't let them pass!

227
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,125
[SOLDIER 9E]
What's that?

228
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,291
[SOLDIERS yelling]

229
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,500
[OPERATOR 9A]
Disengage now!

230
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,416
All troops,
fall back to shaft 2!

231
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,083
We're closing the barrier!

232
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,583
What in the hell
was that damn thing?

233
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,208
[SOLDIER 9G] I saw her.
With my own eyes.

234
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,125
She was riding on
the enemy's weapon.

235
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,416
A little girl with cat ears.

236
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,833
Wearing a maid's outfit!

237
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,916
She was terrifying, sir!

238
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,375
[UNIT LEADER 9A]
This is no time for jokes.

239
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,791
It's not a joke!
You gotta believe me!

240
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:32,291
Shinokaomi.
Code Yatsukahagi engage.

241
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,166
[MULTIPED TANK 9A]
Authentication, clear.

Footgear and crampons locked.

00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,583
Moving main deck.
Releasing barrel.

Commencing rifling rotation.

248
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:01,958
[MULTIPED TANK 9A]
Ready to fire.

249
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,208
Go get some counseling, soldier.

250
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,541
[SOLDIER 9G]
It's the truth, I swear!

251
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,875
[UNIT LEADER 9A]
Calm down!

252
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,416
You and I both know
there's no way a little--

253
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,458
[SOLDIER 9G yells]

254
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,833
[UNIT LEADER 9A] Cat ears.
A maid outfit, too.

255
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,416
I guess he was telling
the truth, after all.

256
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,666
Damn.

257
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,666
So this is about BUER, yeah?

258
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,416
I request your cooperation.

259
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,708
[TAKUMI]
Cooperation, yeah?

260
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,125
Tell me this, you stupid puppet,

261
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,958
why should I have to cooperate
with the likes of you?

262
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:54,750
[TAKUMI]
A video?

263
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,333
[UZAL] I'm going to
say this to begin with.

264
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,291
You can consider this a warning.

265
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,041
[TAKUMI]
Wh--? Uzal?!

266
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,958
My name is Uzal Delilah
and I'm a genius scientist

267
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,458
as beautiful and elegant
as I am brilliant.

268
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,875
[TAKUMI]
And cocky, yeah!

269
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,000
[UZAL] Once it's been confirmed
that BUER is at risk

270
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,083
of going on a
devastating rampage,

271
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,166
I ordered that this video
be shown to someone

272
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,291
who meets a certain requirement.

273
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,625
[TAKUMI]
A certain requirement?

274
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,000
[UZAL]
I'll explain.

275
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,708
If BUER, my greatest creation,
is started in a way

276
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,125
that deviates from
proper procedure...

277
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,541
It will definitely go berserk.

278
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,250
System hacks and physical damage

279
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,708
will yield the
exact same result.

280
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:37,916
If pushed too far, it will
rampage until it self-destructs.

281
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,125
I must make this clear:

282
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,916
I don't intend to hand
BUER over to anyone.

283
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,500
I will say once more,
this is a warning.

284
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,000
The fact that someone is
actually watching this video

285
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,625
means a crisis of epic
proportions is about to unfold

286
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,458
here on Cenancle Island.

287
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,083
As we speak,
someone is attempting

288
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,916
to make a move on BUER.

289
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,791
I cannot force
you to take action.

290
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,750
You're free to do whatever you
want once you hear this warning.

291
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,083
But...

292
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,791
I do sincerely hope you'll
find it within yourself

293
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,750
to contribute to the
cause of lasting peace

294
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,208
on Cenancle Island.

295
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,541
Bye-bye for now!

296
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,625
Looks like things are as
screwed up as ever, yeah.

297
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,791
I already knew the
American Imperial Army

298
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,708
was swarming like ants
all over Uzal's roost!

299
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,333
But I ignored them
because I never thought

300
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,750
they'd actually succeed
in interfering, yeah.

301
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,750
What in the heck is this, yeah?

302
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,750
[CLARION] An image from
just after the fire broke out

303
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,166
at Herme's.

304
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,083
That's evidence that
a particle cannon beam

305
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,916
passed through the foundation
of Herme's from underground.

306
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,375
[TAKUMI] Then BUER has already
started to go berserk, yeah?

307
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,083
Which means what happened before
is about to happen again.

308
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,458
What specifically do you
mean by cooperation, yeah?

309
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,833
I request equipment
and backup, please.

310
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,041
So you want to
start a fight with

311
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,916
the American Imperial Army?

312
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,958
Sounds like big
trouble to me, yeah.

313
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,750
[CLARION]
Combat is not the objective.

314
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,750
I will reach BUER
as quickly as possible,

315
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:59,416
and take measures to stabilize
it by any means necessary.

316
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,791
[TAKUMI]
Tell me this much...

317
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,875
Is following the directive
to stabilize BUER

318
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,375
your primary objective?

319
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:08,416
Negative.
Nene Nanakorobi's safety.

320
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,000
Perfect answer, yeah!

321
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,333
Take this with you.

322
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,208
It's unstable, so I gave up on
my commercialization efforts.

323
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,250
But you could probably
find a way to make it work!

324
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,208
You'll have my cooperation.

325
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,416
But there's one condition and I
have to have your word, puppet!

326
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,416
[TAKUMI]
Don't kill anyone, yeah!

327
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,250
I know more or less
what Uzal was after

328
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,291
when she made you.

329
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,958
So I know it's
a tall order, yeah.

330
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,875
But this applies to more
than just this situation.

331
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,291
The rules are simple:

332
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,125
You won't kill anyone
and you won't abandon anyone.

333
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,541
Not under any circumstances.

334
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,416
The moment you violate that...

335
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,916
You lose any and all rights
to be by Nene's side

336
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,291
and you'll be banished
from her sight

337
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,875
for the rest of your days!

338
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,416
[TAKUMI]
Hear my prayers now.

339
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,416
All forces of good...

340
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,708
I humbly, humbly request...

341
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,500
That you send us grace...

342
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,250
That we might triumph...

343
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,250
And stave off evil.

344
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:39,125
I ask that the holy, ethereal
light of goodness and peace

345
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:42,791
might envelop all forces
of darkness and anger.

346
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,625
I ask, too,
that you might make pure

347
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,958
all impurity with the
divine wrath of grace

348
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,916
and righteousness.

349
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,625
[TAKUMI] I promised
I would cooperate, yeah.

350
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,083
But I never said
I'd heed the warning.

351
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,666
[TAKUMI]
BUER belongs to me now.

352
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,458
I won't let anybody
else have it, yeah.

353
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,083
[VLIND] I followed a suspicious,
borderline creepy, character

354
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,125
to this place because
I smelled a scoop!

355
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,458
And now, here I am,

356
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:20,791
running though this freaky
underground labyrinth

357
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,125
beneath the park!

358
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,250
[VLIND screaming]

359
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,375
Back off!

360
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,208
I'm the world's most
beloved reporter!

361
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,541
The name's Vli--!

362
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,291
[TAKUMI] We won't have to worry
about these soldiers anymore.

363
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,541
I have to admit...

364
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,291
You handled Shinokaomi
surprisingly well.

365
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,458
This block is
fully under control.

366
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,708
That should take care of
most of the bad guys, yeah!

367
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,250
I did it this time!

368
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,958
The world's favorite reporter
hit the journalism jackpot.

369
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,708
[TAKUMI] We'll let the
Gercomas clean up here...

370
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,750
We should continue on with
the elite exterminators, yeah!

371
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,000
[CLARION]
Understood.

372
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:09,125
[BUNNY laughs]
I've been waiting, Clarion!

373
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,583
I'm gonna finish
you off for good,

374
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,250
you stupid little freak!

375
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:15,708
What's the matter?

376
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:16,875
You don't know who I am?

377
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:17,958
Are you kidding me?

378
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,833
Come on, it's me, Bunny!

379
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,333
Stop ignoring me!

380
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,250
Take a good look
at these combat robots

381
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,333
I made, cause they're
about to kick your butt!

382
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:29,125
I didn't oversee Sahar's
base for nothing, you know!

383
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,583
All I have to do now
is lower my hand.

384
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,625
After I do that
they will all atta--

385
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:34,458
[sneezes]

386
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,208
That was an accident!

387
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,541
No, don't! I'm begging you!
Please stop this!

388
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,583
Didn't you hear me?
I said stand down!

389
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,500
[BUNNY yelling]

390
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,833
Why do things always have to go
so terribly wrong for me?

391
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,708
I only meant to threaten
and capture her, that's all.

392
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,041
[BUNNY]
It didn't do a thing?

393
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,958
Geez, talk about armor!

394
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,541
[BUNNY]
What's this?

395
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,041
An anti-optical
weapon smoke screen!

396
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,125
There's no way my robots
will be able to break through

397
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,541
a shield like that!

398
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,375
[BUNNY screaming]

399
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,916
[TAKUMI] What the heck
was all that, yeah?

400
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,708
Once we make it past this block,

401
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,500
we'll reach where
BUER is isolated, yeah?

402
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,916
Uzal's BUER is--

403
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,583
[TAKUMI]
Hey! What's going on, yeah?

404
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,000
[KURTZ]
So you dodged that attack.

405
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,458
It seems it wasn't the
multiped tank's abilities

406
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,875
that overpowered an
entire imperial army unit.

407
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:35,583
You seem too refined to be
Alliance or Holy Republic.

408
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,041
I like you.

409
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,166
We can play this
game if you want to.

410
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,083
Cla-ring...
It's time to wake up.

411
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,750
Where did she go?

412
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,458
You're in a good mood
today, Cla-ring!

413
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,750
My operating efficiency
increases significantly

414
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,083
when my ears are cleaned.

415
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,708
It's easier to work
when you're in a good mood.

416
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,458
And humming a tune makes it fun!

417
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,125
I know!
We should do some karaoke!

418
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,375
I think I'll pass.

419
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,875
[TAKUMI] I'm going to
get my hands on BUER

420
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,791
if it's the last
thing I do, yeah!

421
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,041
[UZAL]
Don't even try.

422
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,666
[TAKUMI]
Uzal?!

423
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,666
[UZAL] It's way too big to fit
in your little pocket, Takumi.

424
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,458
[TAKUMI] Where're you
transmitting from anyway?

425
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:41,208
[CLARION]
It's a recorded video.
