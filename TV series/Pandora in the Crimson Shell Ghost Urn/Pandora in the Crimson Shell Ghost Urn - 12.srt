00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,750
[NENE] Cla-ring, can you
do this with one arm?

2
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,625
No problem.
It's not even a handicap.

3
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,708
Together we can do anything.

4
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,375
Don't forget that, Nene.

5
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:52,500
Yeah!

--[ALTMAN] Hurry.
--[CDF OFFICER] Right.

00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,416
[ALTMAN] Something
doesn't feel right here.

10
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,500
[VLIND] What is
this place, anyway,

11
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,333
some kind of research facility?

12
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,333
[CAMERA PERSON] Whatever
it is, it's a huge scoop!

13
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:10,875
[VLIND] No! This
isn't the scoop--

14
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,833
it's just the
tip of the iceberg!

[gasping]

16
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,625
Uh-oh. We're caught.

17
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,833
This is it!

18
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,833
I'll put my life on
the line for a story!

'Cause I'm the world's

the one and only, Vli--

21

It's time for me to show you two
what true fear is all about.

22
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,625
I don't fear "fear."

23
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:29,625
Is that so?

24
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,333
You might just change your mind.

25
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,583
Dispose of them, Fear.

I fear you don't
amount to "fear."

29
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,291
No way.

30
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,791
Optical and pressure sensors
functioning normally, sir!

31
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,625
[SUBORDINATE 12A] No problem
with audio sensors, either!

[SUBORDINATE 12B] They're all
the real deal, Colonel!

It didn't have an ability
like this before.

What changed?

35

[NENE]
If Cla-ring is by my side,

36
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,416
I'm not scared of anything!

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,958
[KURTZ]
Unbelievable.

38
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:16,000
It's managing to fool every eye
in this base, all by itself.

Fear. Code 2-1-0.

If he can't tell
which one is real,

then he'll simply
wipe them all out.

Now he won't stop until
the battle is over.

Two percent remaining until we
break through BUER's barriers!

So close!

even a master hacker
at a wizard rank

getting past them, yeah!

[KURTZ]
I've waited so long.

00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,583
Finally, this moment has come.

62
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,083
[KURTZ]
Who goes there?

63
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,333
[SHADOW VOICE] We are a
multi-national corporate complex

64
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,041
with a singular agenda.

65
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:30,041
An organization formed
to save all of mankind

from its impending destruction.

67

nothing more than fodder

In the end, it'll all be mine!

knowledge of time and space.

But to you, I am BUER's
Central Nervous Unit!

Yes, I know. I'm about
to release you, BUER.

are you waiting for?

be mine, yeah!

00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,791
My plan was perfect.

163
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,666
Flawless.

164
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,291
I pretended to obey
the feeble-minded monkeys

165
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,833
of Poseidon for a
result like this?!

166
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,416
And I suffered all these fools?!

167
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,833
My time...

168
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,833
My dreams and ideals...

169
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,291
All wasted?

170
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,708
I refuse to accept this outcome!

171
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,750
[BUER]
'Tis over now! Gone.

172
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:38,166
Every last bit of it!
'Tis all over!

173
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,458

[KURTZ growls]

175
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,833
[BUER]
I shall destroy everything!

difficult this was gonna be,

unlock this dang thing, too!

You came to rescue us!

185
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,666
[GYM UNIFORM]
We knew you would!

186
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,250
[TAKUMI sobs] In the end,
the American Empire and I

187
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,666
were doing Uzal's bidding
the whole freakin' time, yeah.

188
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,541
[UZAL]
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

189
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,666
Well, hello there!

190
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,250
[TAKUMI]
Uzal!

191
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,375
What the heck have
you been doing, yeah?!

192
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,791
[UZAL]
That can wait, my friend.

193
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,583
We need to focus on
Nene and Clarion.

194
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,791
Wait, what do you mean?

195
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,458
[NENE grunts]

196
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,250
Thank you.

197
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,250
[gasps]

198
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,958
Nene, please leave
while you can.

199
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,583
It's dangerous here.

200
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,083
You should come
with me, Cla-ring!

201
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,583
I cannot.

202
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,583
BUER has gone
completely berserk.

203
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,625
If I don't stop it, nobody will.

204
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,541
[NENE gasps] Then we'll do it
together, like last time!

205
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,958
[UZAL] I'm afraid this situation
is a little different.

206
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,041
Huh? It's Uzal!

207
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,958
[UZAL]
Hi, Nene. Been a while.

208
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,791
I just knew you were
alive somehow!

209
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,375
[UZAL] I'm sorry to push so much
trouble off on you, Nene.

210
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,958
[NENE gasps]

211
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,791
And please forgive me for doing
this from a bit of a distance.

212
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,083
Hey, Nene!

213
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:08,958
Oh, it's you!

214
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,291
Yeah, its me!

215
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,291
I thought you were in
your room this whole time

216
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,583
and here you are,
running around

217
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,500
doing who knows what
in this underground lair!

218
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,583
[NENE] I'm really sorry!
I didn't mean to deceive you

219
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,625
I just had to make sure
Cla-ring was okay!

220
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:19,916
[sighs]

221
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,375
Well, for now, let's just
focus on BUER, yeah?

222
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,125
What do you mean, the situation
is a little different this time?

223
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,375
When Nene and the others
stopped BUER before,

224
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,125
its rampage was a
defensive mechanism.

225
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,916
But right now,
it appears the rampage

226
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,625
has been integrated with
its Central Nervous Unit.

227
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,333
Wait, I'm confused.
How is that different?

228
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,625
Because this time
you could say BUER

229
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,666
is angry from the very
bottom of its heart.

230
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,083
It can no longer be
stopped from the outside.

231
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,916
[BUER] I shall reduce every last
trace of this island to ashes!

232
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,083
[TAKUMI] Well, when will
its battery run out, yeah?

233
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,958
[UZAL] There's a massive
amount of electrical power

234
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,166
stored up in there.

235
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,166
Cenancle Island will
probably be vaporized

236
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,250
--long before it stops running.
--[TAKUMI] What?!

237
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,041
[UZAL] It's partly
your fault, you know?

238
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,750
[TAKUMI]
Ugh...

239
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,625
Is there anything we
can do to stop it, Uzal?

240
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,416
[UZAL]
Technically, yes.

241
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,458
There is one way: the last
of the final measures.

242
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,125
It's Clarion.

243
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,708
Cla-ring?

244
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,250
[UZAL] Clarion is also a key
to make BUER self-destruct

245
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,041
from the inside.

246
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:29,916
[SUBORDINATE 9C]
Any luck?!

247
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,833
[SUBORDINATE 9B]
No, none!

248
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,958
I'm putting it
into play, men.

249
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:32,958
[SUBORDINATES]
Huh?!

250
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,083
Sir? You're sure?

251
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,291
She's the key? Cla-ring?

252
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,875
You trickster.

253
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,291
So the real storage key was the
little puppet all along, yeah?

254
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,416
But, Uzal...
I don't understand.

255
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,166
What will happen to
Cla-ring when it's over?

256
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,500
And what about BUER?

257
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,250
Don't forget, this is
Uzal we're talking about.

258
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,958
It'll probably destroy
the both of them

259
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,041
without leaving a
trace behind, yeah.

260
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,750
Do I have that right?

261
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,000
[UZAL]
You are correct.

262
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:58,958
[gasps]

263
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,625
No, you can't!

Not a chance!
Not a chance!

265
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,791
I won't let you do this,
you hear me?

266
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:05,708
She's my friend!

267
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,500
Nene, this is the only way!

268
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:08,791
You be quiet, Takumi!

269
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,000
Right!

270
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,208
I'm the one who owns
Cla-ring now, not you!

271
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,583
I'll never let something
like that happen!

272
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,916
[UZAL chuckles]

273
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Nene. At this rate,
the entire island is doomed.

274
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,208
That includes you and
all your friends, too.

275
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,708
I'm sorry,
but Clarion must stay.

276
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,125
[NENE] 
But... you can't!

277
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,833
[TAKUMI]
Nene, please!

278
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,125
This may sound coldhearted,

279
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,125
but it's best to let things
play out this way.

280
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,375
I know you're upset,

281
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,250
but the puppet came here
prepared for this, yeah?

282
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:42,041
[NENE] Cla-ring, how can
you be okay with this?

283
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,958
If it's the only way
to keep you safe,

284
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,000
then it's worth it.

285
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,750
Please let me go, Nene.

286
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,291
I know that you want
to keep me safe,

287
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:51,583
but I won't be happy unless
you're right here by my side!

288
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:55,333
Look me in the eyes and
tell me you're okay with this.

289
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:59,000
You could die.
Do you realize that?

290
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,833
We'd never see
each other again...

291
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,791
Nene's safety
is the top priority.

292
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,541
[NENE]
I don't want this... at all!

293
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,500
I haven't taken you shopping
like I promised you I would.

294

Cla-ring!

295

Nene, are you crying?

296

Of course I am!

--[TAKUMI sighs]
--[NENE sobs]

298

Actually, there is
another alternative.

299
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,333
[TAKUMI]
Huh?!

300
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,833
[UZAL] However,
it might turn out to be

301
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,708
an even more dangerous gamble.

302
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,666
Do you wanna give it a shot?

303
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,833
Whaddaya say, Nene?

[SUBORDINATE 12C]
Colonel, this is inadvisable!

306
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,958
The legs aren't ready.
They're only 80% complete!

307
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,500
I thought I told you,
the legs are just for show.

308
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,333
Why don't you understand that?

309
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,500
[NENE]
I'll do it.

310
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,958
[TAKUMI]
Nene, no!

311
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,458
It's fine.

312
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,208
As far as I can tell, this is
the best way for everyone

313

to have a happy ending!

314

But this plan is total crap!

315

[UZAL] Yep, I figured
you'd be willing to help!

so Nene can--

I refuse.

319
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:06,291
[CLARION] Uzal. I demand that
the plan be retracted at once.

320
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,333
[UZAL]
Oh... Interesting.

321
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,458
She's never disobeyed
my orders before.

322
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,000
Don't worry, Cla-ring,
it'll be fine.

323
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,958
Plus, don't you remember?

324
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:17,916
This is us.

325
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,166
When you and I are together,

326
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,250
there's not a thing in
the world we can't do.

327
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,291
Nene.

328
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:26,125
Come on. Help me do this.

329
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,458
And I swear I'll
come back to you.

330
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,125
Pandora Device. Open!

331
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,625
[NENE]
Release skill. Storage Key!

332
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,833
[BUNNY]
You guys, hurry up!

333
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,416
[GIRLS]
Huh...?

334
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,250
[screaming]

335
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,333
All right, then. Wish me luck!

336
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,416
Here I go!

337
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,916
[TAKUMI]
Wait, Puppet!

338
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,083
I gotta get inside.

339
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,500
I don't know what the two
of you are up to right now,

340
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,125
but it's not going to work!

341
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,083
[NENE gasps]

342
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,458
[NENE screams]

343
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,416
[screams]

344
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,375
[gasps]
Cla-ring!

345
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,958
[KURTZ]
You leave me no choice!

346
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,916
I'll destroy you and BUER!

347
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,125
No ammo?

348
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,375
[CLARION]
Hurry, before it closes.

349
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,458
What?!

350
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,375
[KURTZ]
The leg!

351
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,125
Get ready, Nene,
it's almost time.

352
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,458
[NENE]
Right!

353
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,916
[KURTZ]
No, you don't!

354
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,083
[NENE] Hello.
Thank you very much, sir.

355
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,416
[KURTZ gasps]

356
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,708
I'm really close.

357
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:04,750
[gasps]

358
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,375
Nene!

359
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,833
[NENE]
That must be it.

360
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,375
[BUER sobs]

361
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,625
[NENE]
Hello again.

362
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:25,208
Listen to me, BUER, please.
You don't have to be angry.

363
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,916
[BUER]
Yes, I do! Of course I do!

364
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,958
They saw all those
naughty images!

365
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,625
Now I am ruined!

366
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:32,875
So what if they did?

367
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,666
There is no shame in
something like that.

368
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,125
[BUER]
'Tis a lie! A dirty lie!

369
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,500
It's all right.

370
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:43,583
BUER, to tell you the truth,
those images were great!

371
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,041
They were artistic, in a way.

372
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:51,666
[BUER gibbers]

373
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,750
Oh no! It's not gonna work!

374
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,291
Nene's in trouble!

375
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,333
[KURTZ] That's why I said
the legs were for show!

376
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,625
What?!

377
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,625
Nene!

378
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,375
[CLARION]
Nene...

379
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,208
[TAKUMI gasps]

380
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,500
[CLARION]
Nene... Nene...

381
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,125
What's wrong, Nene?

382
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,791
Answer me.

383
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,250
[ALTMAN]
Freeze!

384
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,541
This base is under our control!

385
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,625
If you think that
I'm afraid of the CDF,

386
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,875
you're dead wrong.

387
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,291
Colonel Ian Kurtz!

388
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,666
You're under arrest for
committing acts of terrorism

389
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,083
against this island.

390
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,916
Have you lost it, Captain?
I'm afraid that you have.

391
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,875
If your island's military
stirs up trouble--

392
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,125
We are no longer a
military force, Colonel.

393
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,875
As of yesterday, we're a newly
established judicial branch:

394
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,125
The Cenancle Police Department!

395
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,541
[KURTZ]
Hmph.

396
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,500
[ALTMAN] You've been stripped
of your military rank.

397
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,458
You're just a criminal now.

398
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,833
Well done, Altman.

399
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,125
You've got it all
figured out, haven't you?

400
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,333
How in the name of
everything holy did that young

401
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,458
whipper-snapper find out
that I was taking bribes?!

402
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,625
[KURTZ]
Well, you'll have to kill me!

403
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,500
[ALTMAN yells]

404
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,500
[KURTZ groans]

405
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,000
You're done here!

406
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:32,541
I'm locking you up and
throwing away the key!

407
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,916
[VLIND] A mysterious facility!
Mysterious robots!

408
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,166
And now what do we see,
but a big, mysterious sphere!

409
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,916
All the mysteries
will be revealed!

410
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,166
But don't worry,
my loyal viewers!

411
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,041
You can trust me to get
to the bottom of things.

412
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:45,791
Bringing it to you live, it's
your favorite TV idol, Vli--

413
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,708
[CLARION]
Nene, can you hear me?

414
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,791
Aren't we going to go
shopping together?

415
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,125
Nene.

416
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:02,000
Please just come back
and call me Cla-ring again.

417
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,041
[sighs]

418
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:11,708
[BUER] O, my sweet maiden
with the jet-black ears!

419
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,708
The request of this pure lass
hath soothed my rage

420
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,250
and quelled my fury.

421
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:20,666
As thanks for rescuing me from
the depths of utter despair,

422
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,708
I shall grant thee one request.

423
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:27,208
State now what you want.

424
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:31,041
My request is simple.
I want one thing:

425
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,791
Nene Nanakorobi!

426
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,125
Nene!

427
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:53,000
Huh...? Cla-ring?

428
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,625
Good morning!

429
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,541
[TAKUMI]
What will become of BUER, yeah?

430
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,291
[UZAL] I'll sink it
to the bottom of the sea,

431
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,916
so nobody can ever get to it.

432
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,916
Besides, upon
further reflection,

433
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,375
I think BUER could use

434
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,416
a little more time to figure
out its own sense of self.

435
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,458
But I suppose the first
phase of the experiment

436
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:14,750
was successful enough.

437
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,458
[TAKUMI] Experiment?
What experiment, yeah?

438
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:18,458
[chuckles]

439
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,250
Sorry, but that's
still a secret.

440
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,916
You make me so mad, yeah!

441
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,833
Hey, listen.

442
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:23,916
[TAKUMI gasps]

443
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,250
Thank you.

444
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,625
For protecting Elpis--
Nene and Clarion, that is.

445
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:32,291
Huh? Elpis... means "hope."

446
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,833
[gasps]

447
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,666
Those two were the true key
to BUER this whole time, yeah!

448
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,250
[BUNNY]
Hey!

449
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,250
I see you found all
your friends, Bunny!

450
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,458
Thanks to you!

451
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,000
I couldn't have
done it alone, Nene!

452
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,041
You rock!

453
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,166
[ALL gasp]

454
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,375
Another tremor?

00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,208
[TAKUMI]
This is serious, yeah!

456
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,958
Here's Uzal's message, yeah!

457
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,458
You'd better hurry it up
and get out of there, girls!

458
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:54,333
[BUNNY]
You're alive?!

459
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,708
You should really listen to her!

460
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,291
Uzal's gonna completely seal
off this geofront, yeah!

461
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,083
Aaahh!

[screaming]

463
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,041
[NENE] Come on, you guys,
we've gotta hurry!

464
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,041
[BUNNY]
This is like déjà vu!

465
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:09,333
Let's go, people! Get out of
here as quickly as possible!

00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,416
Hey, stop! Don't move!

468
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,583
[KURTZ]
I won't surrender!

469
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,666
I haven't realized
my ideal world!

470
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,208
There's no way this is
the end of the line!

471
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,958
[KURTZ pants]

472
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,916
[KURTZ]
I see.

473
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,375
So you're Sahar Schehera?

474
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,250
[KURTZ screams]

475
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,333
We made it, you guys!

476
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,791
[BUER grunts]
So it seemeth.

477
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:45,958
BUER, it's you!

478
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,416
I retrieved him.

479
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,625
Ha-ha!

480
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,250
[BUER groans]

481
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,208
[NENE]
That's it.

482
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:55,458
That's how our incredibly
long and grueling day

483
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,833
came to a conclusion.

484
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,375
I guess that's the end!

485
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,958
[BUER chuckles lecherously]

486
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:02,833
[muffled yelling]

487
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:07,083
[NENE]
We'll see you later, friends!

488
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,958
Nene, things are still
kind of a mess in town, yeah!

489
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:11,416
Please be careful, okay?

490
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,708
Right!

491
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,791
So? You ready?

492
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,625
I know Nene pulled
off an amazing feat

493
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:17,791
and saved the island,

494
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,666
but she's still a
little unsteady, yeah?

495
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,708
[groans]

496
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:25,500
Jeez. How did we end up on
freaking housekeeping duty?

497
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:26,500
[TAKUMI]
Listen up, morons!

498
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:27,833
[GIRLS gasp]

499
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:28,875
[TAKUMI] You're mine now,
so you better work hard

500
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,416
or I'll kick you
to the curb, yeah?!

501
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,875
[GIRLS]
Yes, ma'am!

502
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,958
[AMY]
Shopping with Cla-ring?

503
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,750
And with tiny guy, too?

504
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,458
[BUER]
I am a demon king!

505
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:40,875
[ALTMAN]
Nene!

506
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,833
[NENE] Hello, Robert!
Are you helping people again?

507
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:45,458
Heh, heh.
It is my nature!

508
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,583
[VLIND] So many unbelievable,
mind-boggling events

509
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,291
happened here on
Cenancle Island!

510
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,666
And because of my unwavering
tenacity as a reporter,

511
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,500
we managed to get the
whole thing on camera!

512
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,000
Once again, reporting live,

513
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,500
it's the Universe's most
trusted future journalist.

514
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,291
The one, the only, Vli--

515
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,000
Can I tell you something?

516
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:05,458
I sure hope we find
something you want soon.

517
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:06,666
I already found it.

518
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,583
[NENE]
Huh?!

519
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,208
Well? Are you gonna tell me?

520
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,166
[CLARION]
It's, uh...

521
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,000
Yes, go on!

522
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,000
[BUER]
Hotness! [grunts]

523
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:14,833
It's a secret.

524
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,666
Come on! That isn't fair!

525
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,916
I will tell you, Nene,

526
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,666
but only if you
achieve world peace.

527
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,875
All right, then! It's a deal!

528
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:25,958
[NENE]
Let's go, Cla-ring.

529
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:29,083
From this moment forward, we'll
fight together for world peace.

530
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,541
One... two...

531
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:32,583
[NENE, CLARION]
Yeah!
