00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,000
this stupid department store
preferential treatment

163
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,375
for their contributions?

164
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,625
Please, sir.

165
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,750
You're right, but you
must stop carrying on.

166
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,375
Or I'll have to use my stun gun.

167
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,833
During a network disturbance,

168
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,375
a robot's no better than an
unplugged vending machine.

169
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,791
There's no need to worry.

170
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,083
They probably have
restrictions on their

171
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,458
recording devices, anyway.

172
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,375
Uh... 'Scuse me?

173
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,291
I still think you should show
a little bit more composure!

174
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,791
[NENE]
If it's a network disturbance,

175
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,166
it'll probably be over
in about 30 minutes.

176
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,333
[NORTH]
That's not good enough! Ugh!

177
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,875
[SECRETARY]
Mr. Chairman?

178
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,125
Don't you get it?

179
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,750
I'm headed straight for
an emergency situation

180
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,791
and there's no turning back.

181
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,833
Emergency number one?
Or emergency number two?

182
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,333
[NORTH chuckles]

183
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,083
Emergency number two.

184
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,000
[SECRETARY gasps]

185
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,666
[SECRETARY]
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

186
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,958
We have an emergency here!

187
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,000
Security, please respond!

188
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,125
[SECRETARY]
No luck.

189
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,000
Well, sir? How long do we have?

190
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:18,375
Ten minutes. No, five!

191
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,500
[SECRETARY]
Sir!

192
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,833
Please. Use these.

193
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,333
Come on.

194
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,333
I know it's not ideal, but it's
only me and the androids.

195
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,375
If worst comes to worst, sir...

196
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,291
[NENE]
Excuse me,

197
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,708
but there's something
you should know.

198
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:34,833
[NORTH]
Hm?

199
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:38,333
I'm not an android.
I'm a human being.

200
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,625
Please excuse my
manners, young miss!

201
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,833
I'm Janus North,
chairman of the CSGO.

202
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,083
It's a true pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

203
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,833
It's really nice
to meet you, too.

204
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,041
My name's Nene!

205
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,333
[SECRETARY]
Maintaining his public image

206
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,333
is only making it
harder for him.

207
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,083
He's about to break!

208
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,208
[NENE]
Are you okay?

209
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,208
[NORTH gasps, cries]

210
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,416
[SECRETARY]
Oh, sir!

211
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,291
Just try to breathe slowly.

212
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,666
[NORTH wheezes]

213
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,583
[SECRETARY] Please
hang in there, Mr. Chairman!

214
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:08,416
[NENE]
Cla-ring.

215
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,750
[whispering]

216
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,166
[NENE]
Pandora Device. Open!

218
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:18,208
Elpis Series! Healing Space!

219
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,250
[NORTH]
My heart... My troubles...

220
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,958
It's all being healed!

221
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,333
[NORTH] My painful
memories are fading away.

222
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,166
[NORTH]
Nope! Not working!

223
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,208
[SECRETARY]
Mr. Chairman!

224
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,416
Are you all right, sir?

225
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,291
[NORTH]
I don't know.

226
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,625
Maybe it's not so bad.

227
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,250
Maybe it's just gas?

228
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,791
[SECRETARY]
Gas?

229
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,958
[NORTH] When I try relaxing,
it's actually not so painful.

230
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,166
[SECRETARY gasps]

231
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,833
Mr. Chairman!
Be patient until we get out!

232
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,750
Please, don't give up!

233
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:53,916
Cla-ring?

234
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:58,833
It's open.

235
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,875
Excellent idea, Cla-ring!

236
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,125
[NORTH]
T... T... Toilet!

237
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,708
[SECRETARY]
That was close.

238
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,750
[BUER] Ah!
Verily, now is a golden time!

239
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:09,833
Indeed!

240
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,791
It's kind of dark
in here, isn't it?

241
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,916
Hey, look. I could open this!

242
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,500
Nene, there's danger beyond!

243
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:23,583
[NENE]
Huh?

244
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,500
[NORTH]
You sure saved my skin, yes.

245
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,250
[SECRETARY]
We are incredibly grateful.

246
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,916
[NORTH]
I owe you big time.

247
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,458
[NENE]
Uh...

248
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,625
[NORTH]
Huh?

249
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,583
[NORTH]
No!

250
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,291
[FIREFIGHTER 8A]
Where's our backup?

251
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,625
[FIREFIGHTER 8B]
I don't know!

252
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,791
[FIREFIGHTER 8A] The
chain-of-command must be all

253
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,541
screwed up thanks
to the network outage!

254
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,625
[FIREFIGHTER 8C] The sprinklers
and alarms didn't even go off?

255
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,666
What's going on here?

256
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,166
In breaking news,

257
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,208
a raging fire just broke out
at Herme's department store!

258
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,416
Panic reigns here
at the tragic scene.

259
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,375
Authorities are clueless
as to what might have caused

260
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,833
this fire in the first place!

261
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,791
Do you think it's possible
this was premeditated arson?

262
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,375
[FIREFIGHTER 8D] Are you
saying this was terrorism?

263
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,833
[VLIND]
Burn, baby! Burn!

264
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,083
[FIREFIGHTER 8D]
What do you think you're doing?

265
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,291
[VLIND]
Uh oh!

266
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,333
She just ran away!

267
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,791
Maybe she's involved!

268
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,083
Come back here!

269
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,083
[SECRETARY]
Sir, this is a dead end!

270
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,791
[NORTH] Great! They're already
done evacuating the building!

271
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,125
The alarm never even went off!

272
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,375
Careful, Cla-ring,
you might fall.

273
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,541
[CLARION] The stairs are
still intact on the level

274
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,458
right below us.

275
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,041
It does look like we
might be able to escape

276
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,416
if we can make it down there.

277
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,208
Damn. I wish I was 20 years
younger than I am.

278
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,916
Could you fly back then?

279
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,500
[NORTH yells]

280
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,583
[NORTH coughs]
Damn!

281
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,791
What the hell could be
giving off poisonous gas?

282
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,333
[coughing]

283
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,750
[SECRETARY] If we don't get
out of here, we'll suffocate!

284
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,541
[NENE]
Here. Use this.

285
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:18,333
Thank you, dear.
It's Nene, isn't it?

286
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,875
If we could find a rope, too,
that would be a big help!

287
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,166
You see anything?

288
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,583
Unable to see.

289
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,500
[NORTH]
Fine then.

290
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,916
You all stay here. I'll go.

291
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,041
Yes, sir.

292
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,666
But wait... You can't.

293
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,583
Don't worry about me.
I'll find us a way outta here.

294
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,833
I'm coming with you,
Mr. Chairman.

295
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,333
Nene.

296
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,708
Thanks, Cla-ring.

297
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,083
[NENE] There's no getting
through this sales floor,

298
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,625
is there?

299
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,083
[CLARION] It's over 300 degrees
Celsius beyond the firewall.

300
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,583
The lower floors are
approaching 400 degrees.

301
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,125
Temperatures are still rising.

302
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,875
But our durability will
allow for quick passage

303
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,833
through the flames.

304
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,333
I recommend we leave right now.

305
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,458
Cla-ring, hold on a second.

306
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,833
Those two people
are still inside.

307
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,750
I'm afraid that their chances
of survival are very low.

308
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,250
That's not true!

309
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,000
There's gotta be some way
we can all escape together!

310
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,958
Hey! Look!

311
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,375
That'll do the trick!

312
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,625
Cla-ring. Help me save them!

313
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,833

317
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,208
The fire's spread
to the stairway.

318
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,000
[NORTH]
Perfect.

319
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,291
I can't afford to die now,

320
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,583
especially not in
a place like this!

321
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:49,958

485
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,625
You definitely made the
right decision back there.

486
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:55,958
I promise you...

487
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,250
Next time, we'll get
you something you want.

488
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:01,333
You have my word on that,
all right, Cla-ring?

489
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,125
That sounds perfect.

490
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,833
[BUER] I am afraid thou canst
go no farther on that leg.

491
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:13,208
'Twould be wise to stop and
seek aid from a professional.

492
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,666
[CLARION] Negative.
Nene is the top priority.

493
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,458
[TAKUMI]
Sheesh!

494
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,208
No sooner did I say
don't go anywhere dangerous

495
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,333
than the two of you
go and do this, yeah!

496
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,333
[SUBORDINATE 7C]
Colonel Kurtz!

497
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:43,875
BUER has stabilized!

498
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,208
This is the result
of a single sneeze.

499
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,416
Well...

500
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,833
Let's make sure the CDF
doesn't find out about this.

501
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Quick question, Cla-ring.
What kinda stuff did you want?

502
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,000
I could use some knives,
guns, smoke screens,

503
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,458
and electromagnetic
capture nets.

504
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,041
That sure is some
old-school equipment.

505
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,500
How about we get you
a Beam Rifle?

506
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,750
Or maybe even a Beam Saber!

507
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:39,958
I'll ask Takumi about those.

508
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,291
[NORTH]
Whoa!

509
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,333
What happened to my limousine?

510
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:31,458
[SECRETARY]
It's been crushed, sir.

511
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:33,041
[NORTH]
Who would do a thing like this?

512
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:33,916
[VLIND]
Hey, press corps!

513
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,083
One question at a time!

514
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,583
I'm just one reporter.

515
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,833
Albeit the greatest reporter
in the history of reporting,

516
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:39,875
Vli--

517
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:40,583
[SECRETARY]
Perhaps she did it, sir?

518
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:41,250
[NORTH]
Arrest her!
