[PASSENGER 1A]
Over there!

2
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,000
[PASSENGER 1B]
I see it!

3
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:02,333
[VLIND]
Camera! Sound!

4
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:03,583
Are we ready to go?

5
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,291
Time to start
the legend, people!

6
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:07,750
Hello there, my friends!

7
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,625
We're live outside
of Cenancle Island!

8
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,291
Not only is this
beautiful sanctuary

9
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,625
a first-class
luxury resort,

10
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,291
it's a city designed
with the latest

11
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,000
in cutting edge technology.

12
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,500
Keep your eyes
glued to that screen,

13
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,458
because in addition to
many famous corporations

14
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,166
and name brands
setting up shop here,

15
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,416
many of the globe's
most beloved celebrities

16
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,083
call this beautiful island
their home away from home!

17
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,833
Cut! Seriously,
who writes this crap?

18
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,416
I can't believe
we're already there.

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,083
I wonder what the heck
Clarion is up to.

20
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:43,916
[VLIND]
You know what I have?

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,916
Dreams!

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,583
First journalism! Then TV!

23
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,416
Then I become the
most famous movie star

24
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,583
in the history of the world!

25
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,125

[CAMERA PERSON]
Why did you fall overboard?

28
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,083
That mic is really expensive!

29
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,291
[MIC PERSON] Should we
throw you a life preserver?

30
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:03,833
[UZAL]
Look at that.

31
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,958
[UZAL] That gaming system's
over twenty years old!

32
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,625
She plays it like she
knows what she's doing, too!

33
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,416
[UZAL]
Interesting.

34
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Looks like she's a robot.

35
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:20,958
Hey! You there!

36
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,250
Code zero, please!

37
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,583
State your model number
and your owner's name!

38
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,291
[UZAL]
She didn't respond to the code,

39
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,083
which means she
might be an unauthorized

40
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,666
black-market android.

41
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,916
In that case, maybe
I'll snatch her up!

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,958
[UZAL]
I said, Code Zero!

43
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,916
Wait, do you mean me?

44
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,000
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

45
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,000
People make that mistake a lot!

46
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,083
You see, I'm not an android.

47
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,041
Don't feel bad!
It's not your fault!

48
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,750
I know I sort of look like one!

49
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,291
[UZAL]
Forgive me for my mistake.

50
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,541
I assume you're a
full-bodied cyborg then?

51
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,666
Yes! Wow!
How did you know?

52
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,875
What a relief.

53
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,166
Not many people
understand that right away.

54
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,625
Usually they think I'm
some sort of illegal robot.

55
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,208
I know it's misleading
'cause I'm wearing a swim suit.

56
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,958
It's just that it's been so
long since I've had the chance.

57
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,500
[UZAL]
A full-body cyborg!

58
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,541
Interesting!

59
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:14,583
Huh?

60
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,875
[UZAL]
No, that game of yours.

Monster Bash on
an early model DSD!

62
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,916
It really takes me
back to my childhood!

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,333
Wait...

64
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,500
You said "childhood,"
but this gaming system is old.

65
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:25,958
Real old.

66
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,625
Oops.

67
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,500
I'm so sorry!

68
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,833
[UZAL]
It's fine.

69
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,500
The truth is, I haven't
seen something as archaic

70
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,750
as a non-direct link
game in a long time.

71
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,583
[NENE] I got it from
my doctor, actually.

72
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,250
It's part of my rehabilitation.

00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,250
[UZAL]
You don't say...

74
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,541
But enough about that.

Well, well. Look who's back.

You always say such
vague things, Uzal.

whether you managed

to glean any useful info.

Ladies and gentlemen.

prepare to disembark.

Introduction time.

00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,208
My name is Uzal Delilah.

I have a little business
I run here on Cenancle Island.

to make your acquaintance.

I'm Nene Nanakorobi.

to the island today.

call me Clarion.

Now don't resist, Clarion.

Yeah, she's a lot
heavier than she looks,

and much stronger, too.

So she's a full-bodied
cyborg, too?

00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,083
Oh, wow!

122
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,625
This is great!

123
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,833
I've never met anyone like me.

124
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,541
From now on, you and I
will be best friends!

125
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,958
Look at that cute little
prosthetic body of yours!

126
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,500
So adorable!

127
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,125
[UZAL] Don't you have
the ability to choose

128
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,458
your outward appearance, too?

129
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,791
Well, actually, this is the
outcome of a growth simulation.

130
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,250
And my face was given
to me by my mom and dad.

131
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,500
Filial reverence
is rare these days.

132
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,958
Guess the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

133

[UZAL]
Go on, Nene.

much as your heart desires!

[CLARION yells]
Just not the ears!

138
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,000
By the way, Nene.

139
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,458
While you're here on the island,

140
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,875
is there anything specific
you're hoping to accomplish?

141
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,958
Oh. Well, yes.

142
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,541
As a matter of fact, I've come
here to live at my aunt's place.

143
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,000
[UZAL]
Ah.

144
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,458
[UZAL]
Korobase.

145
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,166
I'm going to learn about
life in the real world

146
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,333
while trying to repay
my aunt for her kindness.

147
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,708
Let me change
the question a bit.

148
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,666
If you could get your
hands on a bunch of money,

149
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,958
I mean a whole heck of a lot,

150
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,041
and you could obtain
anything you wanted,

151
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,750
what would it be?

152
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:36,875
Well, let's see...

[UZAL]

154
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,541
[NENE]
I know.

155
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,833
I've dreamed about this for
as long as I can remember.

156
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,166
It's tricky, though.

157
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm not even sure this is
something money can buy.

158
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,750
And if it is,
then I feel pretty certain

159
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,041
it's going to be expensive.

160
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,208
[UZAL]
What is it?

161
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,083
Why, world peace, of course!

Well, well!

164
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,625
You really are
interesting, aren't you?

165
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,333
You should pick something else.

166
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:07,375
And then you should
let Clarion go.

167

[NENE] When I saw the world
for the first time as a cyborg,

168
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,916
I was amazed that it
still looked beautiful.

169
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,541
It was like I had stumbled upon
some incredible secret truth.

170
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,833
I'm sorry! It's hard
to put into words!

171
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:23,000
Don't apologize; it's a
perfectly realistic dream.

172
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:27,166
If you work hard, then
you can make it come true.

173
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,458
Right!

[ship horn blowing]

00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,083
[UZAL] Well, you have
my contact information.

176
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,208
Once you get settled in,
come and visit us.

177
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,666
So does that mean
I'll get to see Clarion again?

178
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,708
Yes!

179
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,666
[UZAL]
Uh... I'm sorry.

180
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,250
Something urgent has come up.

181
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,791
I have to get going.

182
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:53,833
Oh, okay!

[UZAL]
Oops, I almost forgot.

184

Welcome to
Cenancle Island, Nene!

185
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,958
It was so nice to meet you!

186
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,666
Say hi to Takumi for me!

187

Right! Nice to
meet you too, Clarion!

I can't believe
she is an authorized

191
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,875
No wonder Korobase is so proud.

00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,458
Huh?

193
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,708
Hold on, how in the world did
she know my aunt's first name?

194
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,250
Well, whatever.

Hello, this is Nene.

I'm at the harbor.

No, I understand the address.

So many firsts.

My first trip, my first home,

202
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,708
the first person I've
ever met who's like me.

203
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,750
I sure hope we can be friends.

Wow! What weather!

Dad, Mom...

206
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,958
I felt welcomed
for the first time.

207
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,541
And it was wonderful.

That's the way my friends went.

Why are they going that way?

Run away from danger,
or charge right into it!

meaning of this, Sahar Schehera?

You activated BUER, didn't you?

227
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,541
[BUNNY]
That's correct!

228
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,666
And let me guess:
it went berserk.

[BUNNY]
You knew it was defective!

230

Now the underground

and the organization
is in shambles!

Because you started
it up on your own, moron.

What she said.

234
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,833
I gave you a dummy
activation key.

I kept the real one for myself.

Why did you make us
wear these outfits?

I guess she's not too
keen on being buried alive.

Are you sure you don't
want to beg me to save you?

Do you think they're doing this

pay them enough?

00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,833
[UZAL] Just put your
fingers right in there!

324
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,958
You're joking, right?!

325
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,375
Thanks a lot, but I'm
not into that stuff!

326
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,625
[UZAL] I'm sorry, Nene, but
this is absolutely necessary.

327
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,541
Guide her hand, Clarion.

328
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,708
[NENE gasps]

329
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,375
[UZAL] You do have the ability
to connect via your F port?

330
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,666
[NENE]
Well, yes, but--

331
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,875
Wait a minute!

332
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,000
[UZAL]
Pandora Device, open!

333
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,333
Release skill.

334

Elpis Series. Advanced Firearms!

335
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:35,166
[NENE] Deep inside of me
where I can't touch.

336
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,416
Where there's supposed to be
nothing but wires and machinery.

337
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,250
There's something
new coming into me.

338
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,958
Behead! I meant to say behold!

339
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,000
This is the scene here in
Vulcan City on Cenancle Island.

340
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,208
The ground is rumbling,

341
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,375
and explosions are
occurring everywhere!

342
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,333
This report is coming
to you from right smack

343
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,583
in the middle of danger.
By me, Vli--

[VLIND screams]

345
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:19,666
Where's Sahar?

346
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,916
Get us out of here now!

347
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,750
I'm working on it!

348
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:24,916
[BUNNY]
There they are!

349
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:28,958
Yikes!

350
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,083
[CLARION]
Left!

351
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:39,375
I won't let you do anything
to Cla-ring! So there!

352
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,708
[SCHOOL UNIFORM]
What do we do?

353
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:41,666
[MAID OUTFIT] There isn't
a whole lot we can do

354
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,208
with these pieces of junk!

355
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,583
[GYM UNIFORM] I'm working on
rounding up the security robots!

356
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,833
[UZAL] Aw! Thank you so
much for protecting Clarion.

357
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,875
She has a present
she'd like to give you.

358
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:53,708
[NENE]
Huh?

359
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:54,875
Take it.

360
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,166
Thank you so much, Cla-ring!

361
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,750
[UZAL] Use that to
protect us from danger.

362
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:02,708
I can't do that!

363
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,583
I want to, but I don't know how.

364
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,583
I've never held a gun before,
much less shot at bad guys!

365
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,333
Oh my!

366
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,875
Well done, Nene!

367
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,583
[NENE]
Whoa, what's happening?

368
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:18,583
This isn't my standard base
cyborg operating system.

369
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,666
[UZAL]
Relax.

370
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,458
The app we just
installed in your system

371
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:25,916
is expanding and adjusting
within the framework of your OS.

372
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,958
It's done booting up now.

373
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,666
[NENE]
Uzal! What are these things?

374
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,375
[GYM UNIFORM] I rounded
up the security robots!

375
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,416
[BUNNY]
Kill them now!

376
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,583
[NENE growls]

377
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,583
[UZAL]
Just as I thought.

378
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,083
She's an adepter.

379
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,458
[UZAL] "Full cyborg" is a
cutting edge technology

380
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,791
that's currently in development.

381
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,625
After rigorous rehabilitation,

382
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:11,125
cyborgs finally become able
to achieve basic movement.

383
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,958
Most people are
incapable of adapting

384
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,666
to the prosthetics at all,
so it's likely to be some time

385
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,833
before the tech is widely used.

386
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,583
However, in a few
rare instances,

387
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,083
reports show that certain
people have not only adapted

388
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,708
to the prosthetic body,
but their physical abilities

389
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,541
are greater than
that of a human.

390
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,916
We call these
anomalies "adepters."

391
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,916
They are able to compensate
for the limitations

392
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,541
of prosthetic tech using
their own innate talent.

393
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,000
Information about
adepters is classified.

394
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,791
All we know is that
they're teenagers or younger.

395
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:44,166
[UZAL]
Just like little Nene here.

396
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,166
An application for skill-based
prosthetic body control.

397
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,916
It's what we put
inside you before.

398
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,458
More ammo.

399
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,791
It's temporary.

400
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,750
But the application
gave you the shooting skills

401
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,166
of a highly trained
military professional.

402
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,958
It's essentially a
behavioral supplement app

403
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:03,291
for humanoid robot use,
but you managed it quite well.

404
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,791
Huh? So that's
how I did that?

405
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,666
[UZAL]
Look out, more of them!

406
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,833
[NENE yells]

407
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,083
[NENE]
It's true.

408
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,250
Just like before,

409
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,458
it's as if they're
moving in slow motion.

410
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,916
I know what to do. Take 'em out!

411
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,875
Uzal... What happened?

412
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,833
There's a time limit to keep
it away from undesirables.

413
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,000
The development process
has been put on hold

414
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,541
since it violates a dozen
or more international laws.

415
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,666
[NENE]
Never mind that! Cla-ring!

416
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,333
I was so worried about you!

417
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,958
Whoa! You're all burnt up!

418
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,625
[UZAL]
Clarion's all right.

419
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,166
What about you? Are you okay?

420
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,791
[NENE]
I'm great! See for yourself!

421
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,166
[NENE]
Oh no! I forgot!

422
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,958
I need to contact
my aunt immediately!

423
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,625
That's strange.
I can't get through!

424
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,333
[UZAL]
Takumi is fine.

425
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,083
What?

426
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,625
[UZAL]
Takumi Korobase.

427
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,416
That's right.
I meant to ask you earlier

428
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,375
and it slipped my mind.

429
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,791
How do you know my aunt?

430
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,708
Believe it or not, we're
close friends, your aunt and I.

431
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,750
I'm so glad to hear that!

432
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,333
Now!

433
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,416
Let's get out of here right away
and find a safe place to hide!

434
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Uzal, Nene is awake.

435
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,500
[NENE]
Hug time!

436
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,791
[NENE]
What happened to my clothes?

437
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,333
Oh, Cla-ring.
You naughty little thing.

438
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,541
You're a weirdo.

439
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,000
[UZAL]
You collapsed suddenly.

440
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,583
We brought you here so you
could recover your strength.

441
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,250
Wait, I collapsed?

442
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,416
What's the matter with me?

443
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,416
Nothing like that's
ever happened before.

444
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,541
Where are we?

445
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,166
[UZAL]
This is my lab.

446
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,125
[NENE]
It's like my old hospital ward.

447
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,875
I don't understand,
are you a doctor or something?

448
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,208
[UZAL]
Sort of.

449
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,916
Uzal, there's no time!

450
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
[NENE gasps]

451
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,208
Thanks for taking care of me.

452
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,791
But don't you think
maybe you should repair

453
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:15,708
Cla-ring's arm first?

454
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:16,833
[UZAL]
We'll take care of her.

455
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,500
But it'll have to wait.

456
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,458
[BUNNY]
Sahar!

457
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,250
Come out of there!

458
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,333
Sahar?

459
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,500
[UZAL sighs]

460
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,583
The bad guys
have found us again!

461

[BUNNY] If you won't
come out, we're coming in!

462
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,000
[NENE]
Oh no!

463
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,833
We're in a tight spot, Clario!

464
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,500
Go! Open the
Pandora Device, now!

465
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,625
Huh?

466
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,000
[UZAL] You know what
you have to do, right Nene?

467
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,208
Yes. But...

468
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,666
Are you sure
Cla-ring doesn't mind?

469
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,916
[BUNNY]
Keep going!

470
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,291
[ALL]
Yes, ma'am!

471
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,500
C'mon.

472
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,583
Don't do it for me;
do it for World Peace!

473
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,166
All right then. Here goes!

474
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,083
[NENE]
It's entering me again.

475
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,666
Huh? Something's
different this time.

476
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,875
[NENE gasps]

477
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,833
What is this outfit?

478
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,750
[UZAL] Optical camouflage
tech that's currently

479
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:31,958
under development.

480
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,166
Camouflage?

481
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,416
[UZAL] I integrated it
into your mainframe.

482
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,458
You did?

483
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:37,583
[UZAL]
Naturally.

484
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,041
You want to disguise
your true identity

485
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,041
when dealing with
something so top secret.

486
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,125
Ah! This isn't camouflage!

487
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,083
It makes me stand out more!

488
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,708
[UZAL] I have an arsenal
of weapons for you.

489
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,791
Use whichever you like!

490
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:50,916
[NENE gasps]

491
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,458
Cla-ring, you should stand back!

492
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,958
I understand, but I refuse.

493
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:11,791
[NENE]
Huh?

494
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,166
[crying]

495
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,458
Save us, Mistress Sahar!

496
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,666
Please!
We can't take it anymore!

497
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,708
[CHINA DRESS] BUER is
completely out of control!

498
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,666
[BUNNY]
It just keeps rampaging!

499
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,333
[LEOTARD] The stop code
won't work, either!

500
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,166
[GYM UNIFORM] At this rate,
it's going to bore right into

501
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,083
the base of the island!

502
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:33,000
We are so sorry, Mistress Sahar!

503
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:35,166
I don't like to be
called by that name.

504
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,291
Quit with the crying already.

505
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,041
I'll stop the machine, okay?

506
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,000
[NENE]
Sahar? Who's that? You?

507
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:41,833
[UZAL]
Nene.

508
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:42,916
[NENE]
Huh?

509
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,333
Earlier today,
I recall you telling me

510
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:47,583
that you wanted
to buy world peace.

511
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,000
[UZAL chuckles]

512
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:52,333
Well then, how about
we start by buying peace

513
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,541
for Cenancle Island?

514
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,666
[NENE]
Huh?

515
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,166
I'm so glad we get to work
together, aren't you, Cla-ring?

516
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,125
Don't you listen?

517
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,500
I told you not to call me that!

518
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:35,916
Aww!

519
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,291
But I really love that nickname.
It's so cute, Cla-ring!

520
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,166
Disconnect me, please.

521
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,541
[NENE] Hey, Cla-ring,
I have a question for you.

522
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:33,916
What is that big black
ball thingy underground?

523
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,500
[CLARION]
A boring machine.

524
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:36,750
[NENE]
Good grief!

525
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:39,125
I don't think I could
roll a ball that big.

526
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:40,666
[CLARION]
Boring, not bowling.
