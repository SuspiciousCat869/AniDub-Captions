[GINKO] Lulu, I failed you

I knew how you felt,
but pretended not to.

I lied to you, even though
you were my friend.

Maybe it's too late now,
but I want you to know.

00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:05,791
This is what happened the day
I let go of Kureha's love,

6
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:08,916

Either way, she'd slow us down.

Exclude her. Exclude her.

[GINKO] I had prepared myself
for that day, and so I was

00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:09,875
ready to die there, all alone,

It's okay. You and
I can be friends.

My mom told me
that's what happens.

As long as you
don't forget love,

We will be friends!

[GINKO] After that, Kureha and I
became the best of friends.

[GINKO] We shared so many
things with each other.

made everything seem to sparkle

up on love, either.

157
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:28,166
She'll support love. Ginko.
Lulu will always be here.

158
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,458
[GINKO]
You were true to your word,

159
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,458
and stayed by my side
no matter what.

160
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:38,375
You gave me love without seeking
anything in return. Lulu...

161
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,458
Thank you so much.

162
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,458
Huh?

163
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:43,958
We're gonna be fine!

164
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,708
Lulu will protect you,
and help get your love!

165
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:52,000
Okay, ready? Let's go to
the human world! Growl, growl!

166
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,083
[GINKO] From the beginning,
we hated you,

167
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:13,583
but also, we loved you from
the beginning, as well.

168
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,750
And so, I became
a human girl.

169
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:20,625
Kureha, all I wanted was to
become true friends with you.

170
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,166
So, I had to cross the wall.

171
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,583
[sniffs] She's here!
And you're right!

172
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,791
She really does smell delicious!

173
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,500
[GINKO]
Lulu. From the very beginning,

174
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,791
you were my true friend.

175
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,291
[CHOUKO] Okay. We way
know the problem, right?

176
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:47,000
We have to exclude, like,
both of those bears lurking

177
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:50,958
in our school! Is everyone,
like, totally ready?

178
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,458
So we're gonna, like,
confirm this one more time.

179
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,541
Who should we way use
as bait for the bear?

180
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,791
Let's search sacrifice!

181
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,625
[gasps]

182
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,916
Ah!

183
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,041
[MITSUKO] Would you like me
to lick your wounds for you?

184
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,666
I would not. Growl.

185
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,166
Oh, great. You're gonna make me
work for it today, aren't you?

186
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,291
Come on now, Ginko.
Don't be that way.

187
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,375
We both want Kureha, don't we?

188
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:50,250
No one can deny a
desire this powerful.

189
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,208
Let's find her and eat
her. You know you want to.

190
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,208
Couldn't you breathe in that
delicious smell forever?

191
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,875
I love the scent of a girl who
refuses to back down on love.

192
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,375
Delicious smell. Grr.

193
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,250
[GINKO growls]

194
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,625
[gasps, screams]

195
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,958
[MITSUKO]
Nicely done.

196
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,750
These girls need to
learn their lesson.

197
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:23,250
A hunter is always in danger
of becoming the hunted.

198
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,000
[GINKO]
Growl, growl, growl!

199
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,500
[STUDENT B screams]

200
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,458
[GINKO]
Growl, growl, growl!

201
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,958
[STUDENT C screams]

202
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,041
[GINKO]
Growl, growl, growl!

203
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,125
[STUDENT D screams]

204
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,333
[GINKO panting]

205
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,000
[UKO] This is the Bear-Killing
Beam Truck reporting.

206
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,750
Target Alpha has been sighted.

207
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,958
Now preparing to fire
Eco-Kumagical Gun!

208
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:57,958
[KONOMI-BOT]
Nasty?

209
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,958
Buzz, buzz, buzz! Nasty, nasty!

210
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:06,791
Energy is replenishing. We'll
be at full power in, 10, 9, 8...

211
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:12,916
[KONOMI-BOT] Nasty, nasty,
nasty, nasty. nasty!

212
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,375
No.

213
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,000
[CHOUKO] Wow, they're,
like, still wild.

214
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,541
I can't believe
she way just tried

215
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,666
to take her
bait like that.

216
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,625
So, how did you, like, tame her?
Like, did you tell her you loved

217
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,291
her and then give
her a little kiss?

218
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,291
[CHOUKO chuckles]
You, like, way disgust me!

219
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,875
[beep]

220
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,291
[UKO] This is Bear-Killing Beam
Truck. We fired on Target Alpha

221
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,791
and did manage to scratch her,
but unfortunately she got away.

222
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:45,541
[CHOUKO]
Damn!

223
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,125
[KAREN]
This is D-Five.

224
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,333
I've been informed that the
door in the lily bed is open.

225
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,291
I'm heading that way
to investigate.

226
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,541
I was right, they're using
that place as their gateway.

227
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:59,125
Wily bears. Oh, yeah.
I have something fun!

228
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,208
When I, like, searched your
house, I totally found this.

229
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,375
[KUREHA]
The book!

230
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,875
Your mommy, like,
wrote this, didn't she?

231
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,208
A bear and a human becoming
friends? I bet writing this crap

232
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,916
is, like, way what got her
killed by those bears!

233
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,291
[gasps]

234
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:17,583
[CHOUKO] "Lady Kumaria"?
What are you, like, stupid?

235
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,500
[CHOUKO] There are no gods in
this world. The only thing like,

236
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:26,083
ruling us is the invisible,
like, atmosphere.

237
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,458
[KUREHA gasps]

238
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,875
[CHOUKO]
Here, beary, beary, beary!

239
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,041
I have your food, like,
waiting right here!

240
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,625
[MITSUKO] That was a
close one, wasn't it?

241
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,291
Wow, when did they get
that barbaric weapon?

242
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,500
Well, what d'ya say?
Shall we go eat Kureha, now?

243
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,250
Like you can help yourself.

244
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,000
The desire to completely
monopolize another is stronger

245
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,041
than anything in
the world, after all.

246
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,166
[footsteps]

247
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,916
I told you.
I won't forget love.

248
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,500
And, I won't give up on love.

249
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,541
[KONOMI-BOT]
Nasty. Nasty.

250
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,125
[UKO]
Uh... Oh, no!

251
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,958
[KONOMI-BOT]
Na... sty...

252
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,958
[GINKO] I've finally
found the real thing.

253
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,875
I refuse to let it go.

254
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,583
Um, what are you
talking about?

255
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:25,875
You've already accepted me,
silly. Did you forget?

256
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:29,750
[GINKO] The thing about love is.
It won't be destroyed.

257
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,875
Not by a storm.

258
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:35,250
True love is much
stronger than that.

259
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,250
And it would never
leave me all alone!

260
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,375
[GINKO] I can hear her.
It's the same as before.

261
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,416
Kureha's calling me!

262
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,333
When I was separated
from the others,

263
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,833
Kureha was the only
one to find me.

264
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:56,166
She gave me love, and I didn't
even have to ask for it.

265
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,708
So this time, I'll be
the one to save her.

266
00:17:58,791 --> 00:17:59,958
No, don't!

267
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,541
You can't do that. Don't you
know you're still a bear,

268
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,041
or have you forgotten
the reality?

269
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,458
I am your desire,
which is true love.

270
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,333
And I am more powerful
than anything.

271
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,500
[GINKO]
You're wrong!

272
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:20,625
Desire is nothing, but for true
love, I'll leap into the storm!

273
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,000
[gasps]

274
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,208
You really think
you can abandon me?

275
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,583
That's not possible!
I'm your desire,

276
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,333
you can't walk away from me!

277
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,708
Wait! A beast who loses
her desire will die!

278
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,583
[GINKO]
Goodbye.

279
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:54,291
I will tear my image to shreds!

280
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:58,541
Growl, growl!

281
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,083
Silly girl.

282
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,375
Kureha. I've found you.
Growl, growl!

283
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,208
[KUREHA]
Stay away!

284
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,875
[GINKO]
Hm?

285
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:22,125
Don't come any closer
to me. Just stay away!

286
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,333
What do you want with
me at this point?

287
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,000
Everything that's
happened is your fault!

288
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,875
From the beginning,
we never should've been friends

289
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,166
because humans and bears
have been severed!

290
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,625
We can't be together
no matter what we do!

291
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,333
So you say, growl. But still,

292
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,208
I'm going to become
your friend again,

293
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,583
and there's nothing
anyone can do to stop us!

294
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,250
After we become
friends like before,

295
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,416
we'll be able to share
a Promise Kiss.

296
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,625
That's all we'll have to do
to make me human forever!

297
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,208
As long as you
don't forget love,

298
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,791
you'll never,
ever be alone.

299
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,708
And if you don't give up, then
even if you lose something,

300
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,250
you won't be invisible!

301
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,000
[gasps]

302
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,250
Shut up! It's your
fault everyone died!

303
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,500
Even Sumika!
I won't forgive you!

304
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,416
I'll never forgive
any of you bears!

305
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,583
Stop this. Just go to
the other side, all right?

306
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,958
I already sent Lulu back through
the Door of Friendship.

307
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,208
Go to her, and never
return here again.

308
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,250
[KUREHA]
