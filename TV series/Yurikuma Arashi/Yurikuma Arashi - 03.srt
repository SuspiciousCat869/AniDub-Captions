Whenever you're deciding

inferior to you.

Growl, growl.

318
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,250
You say you want to
save Kureha Tsubaki,

319
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,916
well, that hardly makes sense.

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,083
Why? You two are bears!

Growl. We will still
eat humans, I promise!

If we don't eat them,
we can't protect Ginko's love!

323
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,958
Ah, so you're blatantly
admitting your crime

324
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,541
in a court of law, then?

325
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,833
Ha. Damn it, I'm cool.

00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,500
Objection!

eating humans is hardly a crime!

Defendant bears, I ask you.

Do you want to be invisible?

337
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,208
Or would you rather eat humans?

338
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,333
We'll eat.
