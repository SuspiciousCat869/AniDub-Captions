in more than one form.

why Kumaria questions everyone

you were friends, right?

you are her precious friend.

Well, there is one thing
that keeps coming up.

00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,666
I know for sure mom told
me Ginko was my friend.

169
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,000
And when I was little,

170
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,208
I sang the love song
with a friend I loved.

171
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:19,083
So that friend
must've been Ginko.

172
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,541
But now, I...

173
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,750
How could I simply forget
someone I cared about?

174
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,666
None of this makes sense at all.

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,208
Why? Why are my only missing
memories the ones of Ginko?

176
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,916
Something must have happened
between us. But what?

177
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,958
Kure-pie, what's important
is Ginko loves you anyway.

Then, and now. Ginko doesn't
back down on love.

Oh, growl. Can you try, though?

Will you try to be
her friend again?

to love her again?

They're really

We just found evidence
that proves it.

Hey. Lulu just had an idea.

She thinks she might know the
reason you lost your memory.

220

Why you forgot Ginko.

[KUREHA]
Really?

222
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:15,375
[LULU] For a bear to become a
girl, she has to make a deal.

223
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,166
[KUREHA]
A deal? With whom?

224
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,875
[LULU] With what stands
between humans and bears.

225
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,166
The Wall of Severance.

226
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,875
[KUREHA]
The Wall. You mean those men?

227
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,375
The ones on the phone?

228
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,666
[LULU] Yes. If they grant a
bear yuri approval in court,

229
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,666
she can become a girl.

230
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,625
But to do that, you have
to let go of something.

231
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,958
It's usually whatever
you care about the most.

232
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,500
[KUREHA]
What does that mean?

[LULU] Well, and this
is just Lulu's theory,

234
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,833
but Lulu bets in Ginkos's trial,
when they made her let go of

235
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,666
something, she had to
let go of your love.

[KUREHA]
What? My love?

237
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,041
[LULU] Right. She had to give
up on the love you gave her

238
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,333
all those years ago. Lulu thinks

239
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,875
that's the reason Ginko
disappeared from your memory.

240

That's awful!

Yeah.

you can get it back.

Get what back?

[LULU]
Your love for Ginko!

246
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:16,375
Because you didn't
actually give up on love.

what Lulu believes.
