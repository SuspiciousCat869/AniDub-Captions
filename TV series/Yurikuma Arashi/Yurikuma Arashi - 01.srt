It's pretty private,

Don't worry, Sumika. I'm here.

from the beginning, as well.

All we wanted was to become
true friends with you.

Growl, growl!

Once upon a time, at the
far reaches of space,

38
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,916
the minor planet
Kumaria exploded.

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,750
The fragments of
Kumaria that remained

40
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:38,166
became a meteor swarm that
rained down upon the Earth.

41
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,583
That swarm made the world's
bears rise up together as one!

42
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,375
Then, they all started
attacking humans!

43
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:49,500
Like, who could've seen
that coming, right?

44
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,875
The humans then decided to
build the Wall of Severance

45
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,708
in an attempt to
drive all the bears,

But guess what!

00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,833
Silly old man-made rules
don't work on bears!

Do the math, humans! Growl!

50
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,458
We are bears.
We can't help that!

[LULU] So many girls
for Lulu to pick from.

You too, right, Ginko?

Oh, have you met
Ginko Yurishiro, yet?

She's a bear too, of course!

She's Lulu's darling
and Lulu loves her

Now then, girls,

I'm sure most of you have
heard the news already,

77
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,791
but, unfortunately, a couple of
bears were sighted this morning

78
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:13,083
on the roads very
close to this school.

79
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,916
I realize this is a shock.

80
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,666
We considered it
unthinkable for bears

81
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,083
to cross the Wall of Severance
and enter the human world.

82
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,708
The warning has
since been lifted,

83
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,916
but you still need
to be very careful.

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,416
Even inside the school,
make sure you're never alone.

85
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,541
You should always have
a friend with you.

[GINKO]
There she is.

Yeah, I like how
that girl smells.

317
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,083
Your Honor, the only
thing blatant here

318
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,208
is the prosecutor's hostile
attitude towards bears!

319
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,791
[LIFE SEXY] Counsel, was that
intended to be an objection?

320
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,833
I mean, yeah, even bears
have to eat to live.

321
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,458
That is the way of the universe.

322
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,458
Tell me, do you seriously
expect these poor bears

323
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,875
to starve to death?

324
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,250
But, Your Honor, if we
admit the defendants' appeal,

325
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,375
we can expect more
human lives to be lost!

326
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,708
[LIFE BEAUTY]
Objection!

327
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,166
He's showing undue
favor toward humans!

328
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,458
[LIFE SEXY]
Sustained.

329
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,916
Keep in mind, this court
must act as a scale

330
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,541
that weighs both
worlds impartially.

331
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,291
For that is sexy!

332
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,833
Shaba-da-doo!

333
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,125
[LIFE COOL]
Uh!

334
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,583
Sparkle. Heh.

335
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,000
Growl, thank you.

336
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,750
So, that means we've got
permission to eat her,

337
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:31,833
right, Your Honor?

338
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,041
Objection!

339
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,458
Your Honor, please.

340
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:38,291
We ask you to grant the
defendants a Love Judgment.

341
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,791
[LIFE SEXY]
Very well.

342
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:44,208
Defendant bears, I ask you,
do you want to be invisible?

343
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:47,791
Or, would you rather eat humans?

344
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:48,875
We'll eat.

345
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,000
Bring on the humans!

346
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,875
[BOTH]
Growl, growl!

347
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,583
[LIFE SEXY] I am now ready
to declare the verdict.

348
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,166
[LIFE SEXY]
Yuri approved!

349
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:03,333
[GINKO]
Growl, growl, growl!

350
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:11,333
Yuri approved!

351
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:14,875
Growl, growl, growl!

352
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:20,583
[LULU]
Yuri approved!

353
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:24,750
Growly, growl, growl, growl,
growl, growl, growl!

354
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:38,291
Kureha, I, Ginko,
am going to eat you.

355
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:42,208
[KUREHA] I can't find
what I'm searching for.

356
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,166
[KUREHA]
I can't find it.

357
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,291
I've been searching
in the Invisible Storm.

358
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,250
[GINKO]
Searching for what?

359
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,166
[LULU]
Searching for it where?

360
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,166
[KUREHA] Give it to me!
The Promise Kiss!

361
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,916
[gasps]

362
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,791
[MITSUKO] Thank goodness
you're finally awake!

363
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,875
[KUREHA]
Mitsuko, hey. Where are we?

364
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,458
[MITSUKO]
The nurse's office.

365
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,500
[KUREHA]
What? Why?

366
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:21,708
[MITSUKO]
Something happened.

367
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,916
We found you passed
out on the roof.

368
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,125
[KUREHA gasps]

369
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,916
[KUREHA] What about
Sumika? Where is she?

370
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,458
We don't know.

371
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,083
She hasn't been found yet.

372
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,291
Oh, no. He said the bears on
the roof would give her back!

373
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,250
Sumika! She must have
been up there, too!

374
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,666
Please, calm down.

375
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,541
When we found you, we didn't
see anyone else up there.

376
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,041
Just me? But how?

377
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,541
[MITSUKO]
I'll be right back.

378
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,875
I'm gonna go get you
something hot to drink.

379
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,791
Was that just a dream?

380
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,916
No, it had to have been real.

381
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:06,166
[KUREHA]
Oh, Sumika, be okay, please.

382
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,666
[LULU, GINKO]
Chomp, chomp. Munch, munch.

383
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,375
What's that sound?

384
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,750
Is someone over there
vandalizing the flowerbed again?

385
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,458
[LULU, GINKO]
Chomp, chomp. Munch, munch.

386
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:25,833
Chomp, chomp. Munch,
munch. Chomp, chomp.

387
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:29,375
[LULU] Growl! Human girls
really do taste good!

388
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,000
They're delicious!

389
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,250
[GINKO]
I'll eat them.

390
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,875
I don't care if it's
a crime. Growl, growl.

391
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,625
I won't allow it.
No one can wreck my love.

392
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:38,875
[gasps]

393
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,041
[MITSUKO] Those bears.
They're eating a girl!

394
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,833
[FEMALE VOICE]
Shock.

395
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:45,000
Kuma shock!

396
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:46,833
[MITSUKO]
Those are the transfer students!

397
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,333
Oh, I get it.

398
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:50,583
They've transformed, they're
only pretending to be human!

399
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:52,125
They're really bears!

400
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:07,041
[GINKO]
Slurp.
