I'll never forgive you bears!

we loved you from the

[YURIIKA] I've finally
gotten rid of the nuisance.

Ginko Yurishiro, you are the

And what a stupid girl you were.

Instead of getting love,
you fell into the abyss.

29
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:46,250
It's all your own fault, dear.
You knew Lulu Yurigasaki

pretended not to see.

31

And then you tried
to abandon her.

Now, you're paying the
price for that sin.

Guess what, Reia?

you were dead. Growl, growl.

something was wrong, then.

and make my move,

to her before I could. So...

Why don't we arrange
a surprise for Kureha?

A surprise?

I know someone with lilies
in bloom who would probably

82
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,500
give us some. Don't you
think she'd love that?

83
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,333
I can pick them up tonight so
we can plant them for her.

there early, and together we'll

I bet it will make
Kureha so happy!

mention it was for Kureha.

That's right.

Sumika Izumino wouldn't have
had to die. Kureha Tsubaki

her very best friend, either.

146

[GINKO] I know. I couldn't
help it. Sumika was in my way.

[MITSUKO laughs] And we
exclude those in our way.

bride-in-the-box.

304
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,125
[YURIIKA]
Grr-rrao-rraow!

305
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,291
[gasps]

306
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,708
That was, like, a way,
super close call.

307
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,958
[KUREHA]
Chouko? Oh.

308
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,125
[CHOUKO]
The bear ran away! After it!

309
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,500
[footsteps]

310
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,208
[KUREHA]
Wait, that's...!

311
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:06,000
[YURIIKA crying]

312
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:11,208
[REIA]
Yuriika. Yuriika. Yuriika.

313
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:14,166
Yuriika? Yuriika!

314
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:19,916
[YURIIKA sighs]
Reia, you found me again.

315
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,541
I missed you so much. Oh,
how I've longed to see you

316
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,916
just one more time, and here you
are. It's all I've dreamed about

317
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,041
since that awful
night I ate you.

318
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,125
Oh, Reia. I've been holding
on to something precious

319
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,125
I need to return to you.

320
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,791
In a box, in the middle
of my drawers,

321
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,125
"The Moon Girl and
the Forest Girl",

322
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:44,875
that box has the rest of
your picture book in it.

323
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:49,458
It was the dream of our
love that never materialized.

324
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,000
I couldn't seem
to help myself.

325
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:58,166
I wanted it so desperately
I stole it. Please forgive me.

326
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,625
[YURIIKA]
Yes, you're right.

327
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:12,458
That will be their destiny.
Their rightful future.

328
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:16,291
You know the truth, don't you,
Reia? You know how I feel.

329
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:21,583
I think you knew before
I did. And I still do.

330
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:25,416
[YURIIKA] And we'll be
friends forever, won't we?

331
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,333
[REIA]
Yes. Forever and ever.

332
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,125
[YURIIKA]
I love you.

333
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,416
[KUREHA] I can't believe
Miss Yuriika was the bear

334
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,250
that killed Mom.

335
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:26,708
[YURIIKA] That will be their
destiny. Their rightful future.

336
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:30,958
Here it is. The end.
Ginko's and my future?

337
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:33,916
It can't be. That's impossible!
