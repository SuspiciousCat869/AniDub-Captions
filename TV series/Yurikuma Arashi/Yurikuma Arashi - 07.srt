[KUREHA]
Yay!

310
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,291
[GINKO]
Growl!

311
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,041
[REIA]
Oh my!

312
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,625
You two really love honey
ginger milk, don't you?

313
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:20,500
[KUREHA]  Yeah! That's because
it's the flavor of our love!

314
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,125
Kureha? You spaced out.

315
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,333
I just remembered it.
The ginger milk...

316
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,458
[LULU]
Hm?

317
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,791
Yeah, my Mom made it.

318
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,333
And we drank it here.

319
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,791
She gave it to me and a friend
of mine a long time ago.

320
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:46,583
I'd forgotten how that felt.
A memory can change so much.

321
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,375
Like now. I feel happy again.

322
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,375
--[LULU] Lulu knows why.
--[KUREHA] Uh?

323
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,458
[LULU] It's because of
the honey ginger milk.

324
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,625
That's actually
Ginko's love flavor.

325
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,000
It's the flavor that tells
her she's not all alone

326
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,625
in the world. That she
matters to someone.

327
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,166
The taste of a twinkling star.

328
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,083
Her love flavor is
honey ginger milk?

329
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:09,375
Growl! Lulu hasn't added
the honey to finish this off,

330
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,250
yet, so she needs
to go get some.

331
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,083
Lulu will be right back!

332
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,291
[KUREHA]
I don't understand.

333
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:21,166
How could I forget a friend
I cared about so much?

334
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:26,500
I remember now,
that I loved her a lot, but why?

335
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:30,166
[LULU] Heh, heh! Honey ginger
milk will get Ginko and Kure-pie

336
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:36,166
totally close in no time at all!
[giggles] Lulu is so clever

337
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,208
Uh?

338
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:42,000
Oh yeah,
Kure-pie's mom's book.

339
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,708
"The Moon Girl and
the Forest Girl?"

340
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,250
Kureha! Are you
trying to tell me

341
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,833
the moon girl is
supposed to be Kureha?

342
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:57,041
Then, would that make
Ginko the forest girl?

343
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,500
Probably.

344
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,208
"Once upon a time,

345
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,875
the worlds were divided
into two parts by the sky.

346
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,666
There was the moon world...

347
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,208
[LULU, SUMIKA]
And the forest world.

348
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,250
'I am sorry, but you
may not,' said Kumaria,

349
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,916
for the two worlds have
been severed forever.

350
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Wanting to cross that
severance is pride."

351
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,500
[music plays]

352
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:24,958
Hold on. This is my
mother's love song.

353
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:35,583
[SUMIKA] "There is one way
to make your wish come true.

354
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,458
If your love is true,

355
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,500
your friend will
be waiting for you.

356
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:43,291
You'll find her on the
other side of that door."

357
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,291
[KUREHA gasps]

358
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:12,708
[SUMIKA] "Kumaria asked
the two girls a question."

359
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,666
[SUMIKA]
"'Is your love the real thing?'"

360
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,166
[KUREHA]
I found you.

361
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,541
You're "her," aren't you?
You're my old friend.

362
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,083
[LULU]
Growl-giggle!

363
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:07,916
Okay, Lulu's Special Honey
Ginger Milk is complete!

364
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,500
--[LULU] Growl?
--[footsteps]

365
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,000
What's this?

366
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:18,541
Criminal bear?

367
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:23,708
[LULU] "Ginko Yurishiro,
I know all about the grave crime

368
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:26,125
you committed.
I know what you did.

369
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,583
You were the one who..."

[gasps]

371
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:32,833
[LULU]
Ginko. Oh, this can't be true!
