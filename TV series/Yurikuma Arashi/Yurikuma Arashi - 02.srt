[LULU]
Growl, growl!

2
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,625
Once upon a time,
at the far reaches of space,

3
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:47,083
the minor planet
Kumaria exploded.

4
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,458
The fragments of Kumaria
that remained became

5
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:53,083
a meteor swarm that
rained down upon Earth.

6
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:57,000
That swarm made the world's
bears rise up together as one!

7
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,791
Then, they all started
attacking humans!

8
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,333
Like, who could've seen
that coming, right?

9
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,958
The humans then decided to build
the Wall of Severance in an

10
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,958
attempt to drive all the bears,
like us, away from their world.

11
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,166
But guess what?!

12
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,041
Silly old man-made rules
don't work on bears!

13
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,458
Do the math, humans!

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:16,791
Growl!

15
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:19,833
We are bears.
We can't help that!

16
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:21,708
Bears eat people.

17
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,708
That's kind of, like, our thing!

18
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,791
And so... Chomp, chomp,
munch, munch...

19

[GINKO]
From the beginning we hated you,

20
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:33,083
but also, we loved you from
the beginning, as well.

21
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:36,500
All we wanted was to become
true friends with you,

22
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:39,125
so we had to cross the wall.

--[LULU] Chomp, chomp.
--[GINKO] Munch, munch.

They're eating a girl!

Oh, I get it.

29
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,125
They've transformed, they're
only pretending to be human!

30
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,000
They're really bears!

[YURIIKA] Tragically, during
an attack by two vicious bears,

our friend, Sumika Izumino
lost her earthly life.

Next to speak on behalf of the
student body, Mitsuko Yurizono.

36
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,208
She has been kind
enough to deliver

[MITSUKO] Sumika Izumino
was a gentle person.

39
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,166
She regularly showed
kindness to the weak,

40
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,541
and was always generous
with her love.

41
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:12,291
No matter what, Sumika never
lost sight of herself,

Uh. Mitsuko, dear?
Are you all right?

46
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,500
I'm fine. I'm sorry,
I can do this.

47
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,708
Izumino will be remembered
like a white wildflower

48
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:32,625
in the fields of spring.
She was brave and sweet.

49
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,125
She was graceful.

It can't be.

00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:51,833
I refuse to believe my Sumika
was eaten by those awful bears!

54
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:55,625
That can't be true! It's a lie!

55

[YURIIKA] Please forgive
Kureha for not being able

to come to the memorial today.
She's having a difficult time.

[YURIIKA]
Poor thing.

[YURIIKA] She's lost someone
important to her again.

I can't imagine how much
she must be hurting.

[music box playing]

61
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,916
[REIA] Kureha, did you have fun
with your friend again today?

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,583
What's wrong? You seem down.

Oh, please don't look so sad.

Aw, you really love her,
don't you, sweetie?

It's okay.

66

I'm sure you'll see
her another time.

All you have to do is just
keep wishing really hard.

Oh, Mom, it's not true.

[KUREHA]
No matter how hard I wish.

I'll never see Sumika again!

71
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,000
I failed her.

Why couldn't I
protect my friend?

Bears are, like, the worst.

Yeah, probably.

She's not here today.

Yeah. You're right.
We can't exactly target her

show up at school.

00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,791
Did you hear me,
whatever your name is?!

158
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,416
You can call Lulu "Lulu"!

159
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,958
What?

160
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,583
That's right, and you
can call me Ginko.

161
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,041
[KUREHA]
Uh...

162
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,791
I could taste tears on your
cheek. Growl, growl.

163
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,166
You could what?

164
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:51,458
[LULU] Bathing, bathing, baths
are super-duper fun for Lulu. 

165
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,458
Bubbles, bubbles everywhere.

166
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,958
Growl, growl, growl!

167
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,000
[KUREHA]
You can't stay here.

168
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,708
I'm sorry, but after you finish
that, you both need to go.

169
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,916
[GINKO]
Were you crying? Growl, growl.

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,875
[gasps] Of course
I wasn't crying!

171
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,458
[GINKO] Growl. Say what you
will, but I bet you didn't know

172
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,041
that sad and lonely tears
taste kind of sweet.

173
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,083
[KUREHA]
Mm... Uh?

174
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:25,333
[LULU]
Growl. This is pure heaven.

175
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:30,791
[giggles] Lulu can't believe we
safely invaded Kureha's house!

176
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:35,041
Who's a clever girl?! It's Lulu!

177
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,416
Yeah, so, anyway, once
she's finished in there,

178
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,041
I want both of you to get out.
I guess you can still take

179
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,250
a bath, though, if
you really want one.

180
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,416
[GINKO] 
I don't. Growl, growl.

181
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,708
Fine.

182
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,833
[KUREHA] 
What's with this girl?

183
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,833
She won't stop staring at me.

184
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:08,583
And who in their right
mind licks someone?

185
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,958
Gross. And...

186
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,416
Not to mention all that
weird growl business.

187
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,875
What is that about?

188
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,416
[GINKO] Kureha, your
love is the real thing.

189
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,208
[KUREHA]
Huh? Uh!

190
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,958
[GINKO]
I could taste it in your tears.

191
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,708
Your love is a true love.
Growl, growl.

192
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,500
[KUREHA gasps]

193
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:36,500
[SUMIKA]
I love you so much, Kureha!

194
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,958
And I always will.

195
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,666
[KUREHA] What would
you know about it?

196
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,708
[GINKO] I know because
my love is true, too.

197
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:50,125
[KUREHA whimpers]
There's no way!

198
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,833
You don't have a clue about
Sumika or what she meant to me!

199
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,541
So don't pretend like you do!

200
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,208
[KUREHA pants]

201
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,416
[KUREHA gasps]

202
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,458
[GINKO]
Growl.

203
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,291
[KUREHA gasps]

204
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:14,333
[GINKO] Kureha Tsubaki,
I've longed to see you.

205
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,791
In fact, we came here
precisely for that purpose.

206
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,333
To see me? But why?

207
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:23,541
[GINKO inahles, exhales]

208
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:24,791
[KUREHA]
Uh!

209
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,083
Because of your smell.
Such a delicious scent!

210
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,583
Growl! Oh, yes.
I'll show you my love.

211
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,750
[doorbell rings]

212
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,166
Mitsuko, is something wrong?

213
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,916
[KUREHA]
Wait, what are you doing?

214
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,250
I want you to get away
from Kureha now!

215
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,291
Ginko Yurishiro.
Lulu Yurigasaki.

216
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,958
I know what the two
of you really are,

217
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,916
so back offa her, or else!

218
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,041
[GINKO grunts]

219
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,208
That's right, I saw you.

220
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,958
I witnessed exactly what
you were doing that day!

221
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,041
Now get out of here!

222
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,458
I'm not gonna let you
lay a finger on Kureha!

223
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,833
Do you understand me?

224
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,041
Show her what
you really are!

225
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,250
[KUREHA]
Uh...

226
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,875
[growls]

227
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,000
[GINKO, LULU] 
Growl.

228
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,833
[MITSUKO growls]
Damn it, they were too fast.

229
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,750
What's going on?

230
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:42,958
Mitsuko?

231
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,583
[MITSUKO] I'm sorry,
there's no time to talk.

232
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,708
I've gotta go after them!

233
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,750
[KUREHA]
Uh!

234
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,833
This day can't
get any weirder.

235
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,333
[KUREHA]
Uh... Hello?

236
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,208
[LIFE SEXY] Is your love
the real thing?

237
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,750
[KUREHA]
Huh?

238
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,208
[LIFE SEXY] This is a challenge
from the Wall of Severance,

239
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,166
Kureha Tsubaki.

240
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:18,750
If your love is true, go to
the to the roof immediately.

241
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,541
The bears are waiting for you.

242
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,625
[KUREHA] Who is this?
What do you want from me?

243
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,125
[LIFE SEXY] Give yourself
over to the bears,

244
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,750
and your love will be approved.

245
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,208
[KUREHA]
What does that mean?

246
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,666
Answer me!

247
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,541
--My love approved?
--[dial tone]

248
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,833
[KONOMI] 
Mitsuko loves her?

249
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:55,500
What's so great about that
Kureha girl?

250
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,750
I've never seen her
like this before.

251
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,166
I won't allow it. I won't!

252
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,916
Mitsuko belongs to me!
No one else can have her.

253
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,666
She's mine!

254
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,166
[KONOMI] Kureha Tsubaki,
you must be destroyed!

255
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,458
[FEMALE VOICE]
Shock!

256
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,333
[KONOMI] I, Konomi Yurikawa,
will eat you!

257
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,250
[FEMALE VOICE]
Kuma shock!

258
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:22,958
[KONOMI]
Nasty! Nasty girl!

259
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,291
[GINKO growls]

260
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:30,208
[GINKO] The time for judgment
has come. Growl, growl.

261
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,458
[KUREHA]
I'll never forgive those bears!

262
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,375
I'll ruin them, every one!

263
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,000
[SUMIKA] What flowers do
you think you'll plant?

264
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,041
[KUREHA]
Yuri, lilies.

265
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,833
[SUMIKA] 
Lilies?

266
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,208
[KUREHA]
They were my mom's favorite.

267
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,166
[SUMIKA]
Wow, they're growing so fast!

268
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,541
It's funny. I've never seen
'em like this. I always thought

269
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,666
lily bulbs were just something
you put in egg custards.

270
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,041
Silly Sumika.

271
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:14,125
[giggles] I sure hope
they bloom soon.

272
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,208
[SUMIKA] 
Not long now.

273
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,375
[KUREHA] 
Yeah.

274
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,041
Did you know your love
is about to bloom?

275
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:28,000
My love is about to bloom?

276
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,250
Yes, your love.

277
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,750
[KUREHA] 
Yes, my love.

278
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,833
[KUREHA panting]

279
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,291
Nasty girl.

280
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,250
I won't back down on
my love! I promised!

281
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,541
I'll never forgive the bears.

282
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,000
I'll ruin them! Every one!

283

00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,541
I keep missing.
What's going on?

00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,250
--Die, beast, die!

--Die! Die! Die!
--Nasty girl! Nasty Girl! Growl!

288
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,625
[KUREHA]
That thing.

289
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,708
That monster murdered Sumika.

290
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,125
I have to kill it!

291
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,166
[KONOMI]
Nasty girl!

[screaming]

294
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,791
[GINKO, LULU]
We want to eat that girl!

295
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,250
We want to eat her
right this minute!

296
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:45,833
[LIFE SEXY]
This court is now in session!

297
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,458
[LIFE SEXY]
Welcome to Severance Court.

298
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,083
Let the Yuri Trial begin.

299
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,541
Growl.

300
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,125
Growl, growl.

301
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,625
[LIFE COOL]
Your honor!

302
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,125
They can't!

303
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,291
It has been less than a week
since the bears' last kill.

304
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,375
We must not allow them to prey
on any more helpless humans.

305
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,875
This is obvious and
blatant overeating.

306
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,375
Therefore, yes, they are guilty!

307
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,666
Objection!

308
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,583
What constitutes "mega-hungry"?

309
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,041
It's subjective and
different for every bear!

310
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,416
Sparkle!

311
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,000
[LIFE SEXY]
Objection sustained.

312
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,166
[LIFE COOL]
What?

313
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,291
[LIFE SEXY]
Bears follow bear instincts.

314
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,416
For that is sexy!

315
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,541
Shaba-da-doo.

316
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:36,750
Defendant bears, I ask you,
do you want to be invisible?

317
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,500
Or, would you rather eat humans?

318
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,583
We'll eat.

319
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,666
Bring on the humans!

320
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,041
[BOTH]
Growl, growl!

321
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:47,375
[LIFE SEXY] I am now ready
to declare the verdict.

322
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,833
Yuri approved!

323
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:55,041
[GINKO]
Growl, growl, growl!

324
00:18:55,125 --> 00:19:03,041
Yuri approved!

325
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,583
Growl, growl, growl!

326
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:12,333
[LULU]
Yuri approved!

327
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:16,375
Growly, growl, growl. growl,
growl, growl, growl!

328
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:29,916
Kureha, I Ginko,
am going to eat you.

329
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,791
[KUREHA] I can't find
what I'm searching for.

330
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,875
[KUREHA]
I can't find it.

331
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,958
I've been searching
in the Invisible Storm.

332
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,958
[GINKO]
Searching for what?

333
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,666
[LULU]
Searching for it where?

334
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,750
[KUREHA]
Give it to me, the Promise Kiss!

335
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,541
[gunshot]

336
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,458
[KONOMI]
Nasty?

337
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,333
Nasty girl!

338
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,208
Mitsuko, where'd you--?

339
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,375
That was a close
one, wasn't it?

340
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,833
You're okay, right?

341
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,250
You're not hurt?

342
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,541
No, I'm fine.

343
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,875
I swear there were
two bears, though.

344
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,166
There must be another
one lurking around here!

345
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,041
Bears are usually very
cautious, so we should be safe.

346
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,375
I doubt they'll try
to attack again today.

347
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,916
But still!

348
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,958
[clatter]

349
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,541
[MITSUKO] Kureha, I need
you to listen to me.

350
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,750
You have to stop
blaming yourself.

351
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,916
Her death isn't your fault.

352
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,875
The sad truth is, Sumika
was just in the wrong place

353
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,041
at the worst possible time.

354
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,125
You're wrong.

355
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,333
She's alive.

356
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,083
I understand.

357
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,791
I promise you I do.

358
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:55,958
[KUREHA]
Mitsuko.

359
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,250
I don't think I--

360
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,708
[MITSUKO] It's okay
to let it out, Kureha.

361
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,666
You have every right to cry.

362
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,041
It's only natural.
You were her best friend.

363
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,791
Her truest friend.

364
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:12,708
[gasping]

365
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,625
[COP A]
This is Unit 105.

366
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,833
We found a dead bear

367
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,375
on the Arashigaoka High
School access road.

368
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,541
I repeat.

369
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,958
[KUREHA]
Sumika.

370
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,958
[MITSUKO]
Oh, Kureha.

371
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:44,791
Your sweet love
belongs to me now.

372
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:48,375
Slurp.

373
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,666
That delicious smell!

374
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,375
[giggles]

375
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,041
[MITSUKO]
Ah, you're so good.

376
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,083
I'm aching for you!

377
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,125
Not yet, though.

378
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,958
Tonight is not our night.

379
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:13,500
[MITSUKO]
Growl, growl, chomp, chomp.

380
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:14,791
Growl, growl, chomp, chomp.

381
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,916
Growl, growl, chomp, chomp.

382
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,750
Growl, growl, chomp, chomp.

383
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,375
Still no good.

384
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:23,458
Invisible girls always
taste supremely invisible.

385
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:28,250
After tearing apart so many
of them, I finally understand.

386
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:32,916
Only the excluded ones can be
truly wonderful and delicious.

387
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,291
It's the girls who refuse
to back down on love

388
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:38,500
that taste like
pomegranates and honey.

389
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:42,666
Their meat is the only thing
that will satisfy my hunger!

390
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:48,750
Sumika Izumino, you tasted
like a dream come true.

391
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:52,875
Soon, the Invisible
Storm will come soon!

392
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:56,208
Oh, I can't wait!

393
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,500
Right now!

394
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,958
I want that girl
right this minute!

395
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,916
Kureha Tsubaki!

396
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,333
Yes, I'm going to eat you
very soon, growl-growl!
