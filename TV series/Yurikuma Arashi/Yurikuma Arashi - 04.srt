Milne?

316
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,125
[LULU]
Who are you?

317
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,666
[STRANGER] Here, is this
your little brother's?

318
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,000
[gasps] Yes, it is.

319
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:41,041
[STRANGER] I found it across the
valley, so I came to deliver it.

320
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,750
Did you throw this away?

321
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,166
[LULU]
Yeah.

322
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,791
[STRANGER]
It still belongs to you.

323
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,666
If you forget about
the thing you've lost,

324
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,791
then you really will
lose it, eventually.

325
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,041
[gasps]

326
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,083
[clunk]

327
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,666
Good talk.

328
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,208
[LULU gasps]

329
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,416
[ATTENDANT ONE] It was a
tragic, tragic accident!

330
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,458
The way Prince Milne died
was awful. As always,

331
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,541
the darling little prince said
he wanted to go get some honey

332
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,875
to bring back for his
beloved sister, Princess Lulu.

333
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,833
He went up to the
bees' nest, and was stung.

334
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,041
That's what killed him.

335
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,750
It all happened so quickly.

336
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,375
[MILNE]
You promised you would!

337
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,083
Kiss me, Sis! Kiss me!

338
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,291
[LULU]
From the beginning,

339
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,250
Lulu hated you.

340
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:47,541
But also, Lulu must have loved
you from the beginning, as well.

341
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,875
[GINKO]
Well, that sucks.

342
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,333
Your honey porridge is good.
Shame to waste it.

343
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,583
[LULU]
It's because Lulu made her mad.

344
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,375
The only thing Lulu
figures she did wrong

345
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,875
was say we were trying
to be good friends.

346
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,083
Lulu just wanted to be nice.

347
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,750
Lulu.

348
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,916
Thanks, Ginko.

349
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,041
My love is about making
sure your love is fulfilled.

350
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,291
Lulu feels like
if she can do that,

351
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:25,208
if she can help you, Lulu might
be able to see him again.

352
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,875
One more time.

353
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,458
And that's why... why Lulu.

354
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,416
[GINKO] Well, I have
someplace to be, so see ya.

355
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,958
[LULU]
Wait! Where are you going?

356
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,916
[GINKO]
Beyond the Wall of Severance.

357
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,416
To the human world?

358
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,958
But, if you do that, you're
for sure gonna get killed.

359
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,583
Oh, no, I'll be fine.

360
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,958
That's because
I got love from her.

361
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,166
[LULU]
You "got love"?

362
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,708
Yeah, so I'm gonna
go return it.

363
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,000
I'll see her and
deliver my love.

364
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,916
I made her a promise.

365
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,875
We would meet again,
and I would kiss her.

366
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,250
Kiss her?

367
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,333
Yes. It's a Promise Kiss.

368
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,583
[MILNE]
You promised!

369
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,875
Kiss me, Sis! Kiss me!

370
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,750
[LULU] So, this girl is on
the other side of the wall?

371
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,375
[GINKO] Yeah, I know
she's waiting for me.

372
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,083
[LULU]
But she's human, right?

373
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,041
If you meet her,
she might try to kill you.

374
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,041
[gunshot]

375
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,375
Yes, I know.

376
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,166
That doesn't bother you?

377
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,625
No way.

378
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,875
Because I am a criminal bear.

379
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,875
I refuse to back
down on my love.

380
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,541
[gasps]

381
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,791
Take me with you.

382
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:34,708
What?

383
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,208
Take me with you
across the wall!

384
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,333
Oh, please, let me go along!

385
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,625
If you take me,
I can help you.

386
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,750
We can work side by side.
Get you that Promise Kiss!

387
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,583
Why would you do that?

388
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,875
Because, like you,
I'm a criminal bear!

389
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,583
[LULU]
You're me... before I lost mine.

390
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,541
No, that's wrong.

391
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,583
I think you've already
lost yours once.

392
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:05,750
But if there's someone out there

393
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,500
still alive for you
to meet, we'll go.

394
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,916
Even if that girl
is across the wall!

395
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:18,041
[LIFE SEXY] Defendant bear
Lulu Yurigasaki, I ask you this.

396
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,875
Will you give up on love?

397
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:23,416
Or, will you give up on kisses?

398
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,458
I'll never give up on love,
so I'll give up on kisses.

399
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,083
[BOTH grunt]

400
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,416
[LULU]
Growl.

401
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,541
Please, oh, please,
make me a human girl!

402
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,541
I've just gotta go to
the other side of the wall.

403
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,583
I can't let Ginko go alone!

404
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,333
First, I need you to understand
that if you make this choice,

405
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,833
you will lose
all kisses forever.

406
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,958
[LULU] They're already lost,
and I'll never see them again.

407
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,375
But not for Ginko.

408
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,666
I know she'll still
be able to see hers!

409
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,250
So, since I can't have mine,

410
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,750
I'll help complete
her Promise Kiss.

411
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:53,958
[LIFE SEXY]
In other words,

412
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,041
you're entrusting
Ginko Yurishiro

413
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,916
with the wish you failed
to fulfill yourself?

414
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,416
Trying to achieve
self-actualization that way

415
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,041
is mere self-satisfaction.

416
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:07,416
It is pride. And that,
dear, is a crime.

417
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,333
Great. I'm okay with it
since I'm a criminal bear.

418
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:15,500
[LIFE SEXY] I see. I shall
now declare the verdict.

419
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,833
Yuri approved!

420
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,291
[LULU]
Growly-growl, growl!

421
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:32,875
[LIFE SEXY] And thus,
Princess Lulu. Correction.

422
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,083
And thus Lulu Yurigasaki,

423
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,958
set out with Ginko
Yurishiro as human girls

424
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:40,916
to cross the Wall of Severance.

425
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,708
Now, the question remains,

426
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,250
will the Promise
Kiss come to pass?

427
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,708
For that is sexy.

428
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:50,791
Shaba-da-doo.
