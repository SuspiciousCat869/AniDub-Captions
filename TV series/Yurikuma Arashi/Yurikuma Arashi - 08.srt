1
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,291
[KUREHA]
It's you.

2
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,500
[KUREHA]
I found you.

3
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:50,208
You're her, aren't you?
You're my old friend.

4
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:55,291
I can't believe it.
I loved you so much.

5
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,833
Didn't we get to take
a photo together?

6
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:00,291
I remember we drank some
honey ginger milk that

7
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:04,666
Mom made for us, and then,
we sang the Love Song.

8
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,416
Why didn't you say anything?

9
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,916
[GINKO gasps]

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,041
You're warm. You must
still have a fever.

11
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:18,375
[KUREHA sighs, gasps]

12
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,541
[GINKO gasps]

13
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:23,500
[gasps] That pendant was Mom's.

14
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,625
Why do you have it,
when the only one who could

15
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:29,333
is the bear that killed her?
What's going on?

16
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:37,083
[GINKO, LULU]
Yurikuma!

17
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:39,458
Yurikuma Arashi!

18
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,458
[YURIIKA]
I was once unwanted.

19
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:21,000
A lonely bear cub abandoned
in the human world.

20
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,708
I found you.

21
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,750
[YURIIKA]
That was when I met "Him."

22
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:36,458
[HIM] Don't worry, I'll shelter
you. This school is my "box."

23
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,708
[YURIIKA]
He really, really liked boxes.

24
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,083
[HIM]
My dear Yuriika.

25
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,750
It's important for
you to understand

26
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,333
that this world sullies
anything pure.

27
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,541
Here.

28
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,041
If I do this, the flower
will be able to stay

29
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,250
unsullied for the
rest of eternity.

30
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:59,625
You see, in this world,
only the unsullied have value.

31
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,208
[YURIIKA]
Grraow! Grraow!

32
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,708
[HIM]
You're incredibly beautiful,

33
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,666
Yuriika, and you're so special.

34
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,666
The most especially
precious treasure I own.

35
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,791
[YURIIKA] I allowed him
to put me into his box.

36
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,791
[YURIIKA]
And I was happy there.

37
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,375
As long as I stayed
inside his box,

38
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:28,208
I was an especially precious,
unsullied creature.

39
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,000
I was unwanted no more.

40
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,250
[YURIIKA]
But then, one day...

41
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,000
[HIM] I'm afraid I've
found my next wonderfully

42
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,291
unsullied creature.
So, I'm leaving.

43
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,833
[YURIIKA]
Wait. Wait!

44
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:48,875
Please, my precious one.
Please don't abandon me here!

45
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:52,250
Grraow!

46
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,458
[FEMALE VOICE]
Kuma shock!

47
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,416
[YURIIKA] In that moment,
I learned the truth.

48
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,791
I understood what he
was trying to teach me.

49
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,708
You must box up what
is precious to you.

50
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,541
Otherwise, they'll walk
right out of your life,

51
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,041
and wind up sullied.

52
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:15,125
From now on,
this school is my box.

53
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,000
[REIA]
Why are you cutting them down?

54
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,833
I have to cut all these blooms
before they get sullied.

55
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,958
If not, I can't put
them in a box.

56
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,000
[REIA] Why would you
want to box them up?

57
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,000
[YURIIKA]
So I can protect these pure,

58
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,125
precious things from the world.

59
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,708
If I protect all the things
that are precious to me,

60
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:42,041
then I'll be special.
Because if I am not special...

61
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,291
[snip]

62
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,583
[YURIIKA] If I am unwanted,
no one will find me.

63
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,666
I found you.

64
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,333
[gasps] You found me.
Are you sure?

65
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,416
Yes. So get out of
that box of yours.

66
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,666
If you never open the
box and see and touch

67
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,666
your precious collection,
then you might as well

68
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,750
just not have anything at all.

69
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:07,833
Might as well not...
Do you feel empty, too?

70
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,125
Like the whole world
is invisible?

71
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,750
Open up your boxes.

72
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,958
I'd love it if you'd show me
what is truly precious to you.

73
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,000
[YURIIKA gasps]

74
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:34,500
[YURIIKA] And so Reia and I
became the best of friends.

75
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:38,333
She gave color to my
blank, invisible world.

76
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,500
Everything changed.

77
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,791
[YURIIKA] I found all sorts of
precious and wonderful things

78
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,791
when I was with Reia.

79
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:55,291
[YURIIKA] She allowed
herself to be sullied with me,

80
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,000
and I was honored.

81
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,000
[YURIIKA]
Reia, I-I want to say...

82
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,041
[YURIIKA]
I need to say...

83
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,458
[YURIIKA]
I love you!

84
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,000
[YURIIKA]
Reia, do you love me, too?

85
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,750
[REIA]
Yes, I love you so much.

86
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,166
[YURIIKA] And we'll be
friends forever, won't we?

87
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,000
[REIA]
Yes. Forever and ever.

88
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,083
[YURIIKA]
Reia?

89
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,958
[REIA]
Yes?

90
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,625
[YURIIKA]
Happy birthday.

91
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Yuriika!

92
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,375
I thought the perfect
gift would be

93
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,000
to have proof of our friendship.

94
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,250
[REIA]
A pledge to never forget love.

95
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,666
[YURIIKA] As long as
you don't forget love,

96
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,000
you'll never,
ever be truly alone.

97
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,583
And if you never
give up on love,

98
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:49,166
even if you lose something,
you'll never be invisible.

99
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:55,083
Reia. I love you.
Oh, I love you so much.

100
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,333
[YURIIKA]
I knew all along

101
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,416
that Reia's love was
different from mine.

102
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,166
I knew it. But, I couldn't help
myself. I wallowed in that

103
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,375
sweet, fleeting desire,
and it was beautiful.

104
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,416
[baby coos]

105
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,625
[REIA] Her name is Kureha.
It means "red wing".

106
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,666
She's perfect, don't you think?

107
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,041
Let that go. It seems she
wants this pendant for herself.

108
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,458
Isn't that sweet?

109
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:26,958
Sweet.

110
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,875
[REIA] Now, Kureha, say hi
to one of Mama's best friends

111
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,291
in the whole wide world.

112
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,250
[KUREHA laughs]

113
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,875
[HIM] See. Did I not
tell you as much?

114
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,541
You must box up all
your precious things.

115
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:44,166
Otherwise, they'll be sullied,
and you'll lose them.

116
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,375
[HIM] Now Reia's love
has been lost.

117
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,583
That baby took it away,
and it's your fault.

118
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:54,583
You left your box, like a fool,
and became sullied.

119
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,416
Babies are perfect.

120
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,875
They're among the purest
things in this filthy world.

121
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,083
No more.

122
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,166
I will give up on love.

123
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:30,000
[YURIIKA] I'm sullied,
so I'm dirty and empty.

124
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,791
I am invisible.

125
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:36,666
I am not precious enough for
someone to box up anymore.

126
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,291
So now. I am a box.

127
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,333
I've become an empty box,

128
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,583
wishing for something
to fill my void.

129
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:52,041
[YURIIKA] The stars rained down,
the world was still invisible.

130
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,583
Then, the Wall of
Severance was formed.

131
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:58,166
And now, we can
never go back again.

132
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,666
Never.

Complete me! I need
you to fill in my gaps!

I'm so lonely! Please, Reia!

136
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,250
Please, help me!

Reia!

[REIA] Take this pendant with
you, sweetie. It's a love charm.

139
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,916
I know it will help you
the way it helped me.

Grraow!

[REIA]
Mm?

142
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,333
[YURIIKA] Why did you
give your pendant away?

143
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,166
Do you love her instead of me?

144
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,541
[REIA]
No! She's just Kureha's friend!

145
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,041
[YURIIKA]
Is she? I don't care.

146
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,750
You threw the proof of our
friendship away! Grraow.

147
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,875
You threw my love away! Grraow!

148
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:00,916
[REIA screams]

149
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,666
[YURIIKA]
Chomp-chomp, Grraow.

150
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:10,250
Chomp-chomp, Grraow.
Chomp-chomp, Grraow.

151
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:15,708
[YURIIKA] I ate Reia. I wanted
to put her in the box of myself.

152
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,375
Surely that would complete me.

153
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,791
At least, that's what I thought.

154
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,916
[YURIIKA] Even after eating
Reia, I felt starved.

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,708
The emptiness inside me
still me wasn't filled.

found myself interrogating her.

Well...

The night my mom
was killed by a bear,

160
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:56,625
the pendant she was
wearing disappeared.

Why in the world do
you have it, Ginko?

Not right now.

The only thing she would say was
she couldn't tell me right then,

Reia's pendant.

You think she's the
bear that killed Mom?

Oh, no.

You were young,

and she got close to you by
saying she was your friend.

177

Then, she took away the most
precious thing in your life.

307
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:52,000
I won't forgive those
who try to exclude her.

308
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:55,125
I'm a bear.
What else could I do?

309
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,708
[KUREHA]
Oh, no.

310
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,958
Didn't I tell you as much? Bears
don't feel love or friendship.

311
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:03,416
They're sullied beasts.
And that is their true nature.

312
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,750
Do it, already. Shoot that
thing until it's dead.

313
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,708
But I...

314
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,416
--[GINKO] It's okay, Kureha.
--[KUREHA gasps]

315
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,000
[GINKO]
I finally understand.

316
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,625
When Lady Kumaria told me
about the Promise Kiss,

317
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,625
she was actually talking
about that bullet

318
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,250
in the chamber of your gun.
Growl, growl.

319
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,583
What?

320
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,875
[GINKO] I'll accept
this as a criminal bear.

321
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,375
Hopefully, it'll prove to you

322
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,000
the love I have
is the real thing.

323
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,416
If this is the only way to
become true friends with you

324
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,333
again, then I will embrace it.

325
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,125
Do it! Why you hesitating?

326
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,416
Punish that criminal
bear right now!

327
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,291
Give me the Promise Kiss.
I'm ready.

328
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,166
[gasps]

329
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:02,250
[KUREHA]
Promise Kiss? From me, to you?

330
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,750
[GINKO]
And me to you.

331
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:08,000
Then, everything will awaken,
and it will all change.

332
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,458
What do you think
you're doing?

333
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,333
I... can't shoot.

334
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,916
Don't be absurd!

335
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:37,000
[KUREHA] Killing her isn't
going to bring Mom back to me.

336
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,583
It won't change anything.

337
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,250
[YURIIKA]
You mustn't forgive her!

338
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,166
Give this woman-eating bear
the Bullet of Judgment.

339
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,291
[KUREHA]
I can't do that.

340
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,916
How could I when Ginko
was the one who saved me

341
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,333
from the Invisible Storm?
She jumped into the fire, too.

342
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:54,416
She risked her life to protect
Sumika's letter for me.

343
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,125
You fool. That beast is just

344
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,333
a criminal bear
pretending to be pure!

345
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,208
I don't care!

346
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,250
--[LULU] Kure-pie!
--[KUREHA] Huh?

347
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,291
[YURIIKA gasps]

348
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:06,875
[KUREHA]
Lulu.

349
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,625
[LULU]
Kure-pie. Lulu knows the truth.

350
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,708
She found out what
Ginko did to Sumika.

351
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,083
[KUREHA gasps]

352
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:20,333
Yes. Ginko committed
a grave crime, growl.

353
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,416
Ginko is the reason
why Sumika is--

354
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,291
[thunder strikes]

355
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,750
[inaudible]

356
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,541
[thunder rumbles]

357
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:42,333
[inaudible]

358
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:52,375
How could you, Ginko?
I'll never forgive you bears!

359
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,666
I'll ruin you, now. Every one!

360
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:04,125
[REIA] Tell me.
Is your love the real thing?

361
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:05,875
[gun shot]
