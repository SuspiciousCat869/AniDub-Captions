1
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:44,458
[FEMALE VOICE]
Shock!

2
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,041
[GINKO screaming]

3
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,375
Ginko!

4
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,208
[laughing]

5
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:54,291
One bear successfully
eliminated by our trap!

6
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,041
We known what you two really
are, and this is what you get!

7
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,083
[LULU gasps]

8
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:02,083
[GINKO] From the beginning,
we hated you,

9
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:06,416
but also, we loved you
from the beginning, as well.

10
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,791
All we wanted was to become
true friends with you,

11
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,208
so we had to cross the wall.

12
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:15,125
I had to have you all to myself.

13
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,958
Tomorrow's the day.

14
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:24,166
Oh, Sumika. What was it
you wanted to tell me?

15
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,416
[GINKO, LULU]
Yurikuma!

16
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,791
Yurikuma Arashi!

17
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,791
[sighs] This letter is hard.

18
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,291
I barely even know what to say.

19
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,041
[SUMIKA] I guess, I can
start at the beginning.

20
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,500
The moment I first met Kureha.

21
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,625
I'll never forget that day.

22
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:38,583
Oh, no. It's gone.
I can't find it.

23
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,916
Grandma gave me that hairpin
especially for today.

24
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,750
I can't believe I lost it.

25
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,375
[KUREHA]
Are you looking for this?

26
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,666
Uh.

27
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,500
[KUREHA]
Here.

28
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,666
[SUMIKA gasps]

29
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,041
It's yours, right?

30
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,333
Yes, thank you.

31
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,458
[SUMIKA] I know you probably
don't remember that, but I do,

32
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,416
and it meant the world to me.

33
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,875
I was so happy you were there,
so happy to have met you.

34
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,375
[SUMIKA]
And then, there was that storm,

35
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,083
and I wanted to protect
what you cared about.

36
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,333
[gasps]

37
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,541
You came out, too.

38
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,083
[SUMIKA]
We got soaked, remember?

39
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:34,291
Sure, it was scary, but we ended
up having such a good time.

40
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,500
I started feeling
so close to you.

41
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,625
Like it was just you and me.

42
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,541
The only two people
in the whole world.

43
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,125
It was heaven.

44
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:48,791
I remember everything about
that day, but more importantly,

45
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:52,833
I will always remember it,
even when I'm old and gray.

46
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,625
[SUMIKA] "The Moon Girl
and the Forest Girl."

47
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,458
Your mother wrote this?

48
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,666
Yep, it was actually
her last book.

49
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,083
Since it was never published,

50
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:11,208
it's the only copy.
It's so good.

51
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,500
Mind if I read it?

52
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,750
Not at all.

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,375
[SUMIKA]
"Once upon a time,

54
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:23,208
the worlds were divided
into two parts by the sky.

55
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:27,125
There was the moon world,
and the forest world.

56
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,708
One day, a moon girl
accidentally dropped

57
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,583
her mother's precious pendant.

58
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,958
It fell far down
into the forest.

59
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,083
A forest girl stumbled
upon the pendant

60
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,541
while she was out walking.

61
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,208
Surprised by its sparkling star,

62
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,333
she found herself
looking up at the sky

63
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,041
to see where it came from.

64
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,875
She started to think
what she could see

65
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,583
might not be all
there was, and said,

66
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:56,083
'There must be an amazing
world beyond that sky.'

67
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,875
Meanwhile, the moon girl
couldn't stop wondering

68
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:03,041
about the forest world, and
what happened to the pendant.

69
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:07,166
'Where is Mother's pendant?'
she said. 'I have to go find it.

70
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,291
There must be an amazing world
beyond that sky.'

71
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,375
Day after day, the moon girl
and the forest girl

72
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:19,041
looked at the sky, each one
gazing from their own world.

73
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:23,625
At long last, they decided
to appeal to Lady Kumaria,

74
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:27,291
for she was the
Goddess of the Sky.

75
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,041
The moon girl prayed,

76
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:34,000
'Please help me, Lady Kumaria.
I want to go beyond the sky,

77
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:37,416
so I can find
my mother's lost pendant.'

78
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,291
The forest girl prayed,

79
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:44,041
'Please help me, Lady Kumaria.
I want to go beyond the sky,

80
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:48,041
so I can deliver this lost star
to the one who dropped it.'

81
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:51,083
'I am sorry, but you
may not,' said Kumaria,

82
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,791
'For the two worlds
have been severed forever.

83
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,625
Wanting to cross that
severance is pride,

84
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,458
and pride, as you know,
is a grave sin.'

85
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,750
And yet, they prayed again.

86
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:07,166
'Please help us, we still want
to go beyond the sky.'

87
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,666
Reluctantly,
Kumaria answered them.

88
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,375
'There is one way
to make your wish come true.

89
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,083
In the center of the sky

90
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:22,666
is a place called
the Door to Friendship.

91
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,666
If your love is true, your
friend will be waiting for you.

92
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,000
You'll find her on the
other side of that door.

93
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,500
When you see her,
give her a Promise Kiss.

94
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:37,541
Do that, and your wish
shall come true.'

95
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:41,708
Kumaria asked the
two girls a question.

96
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:45,375
'Is your love the real thing?'

97
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,083
Then, she laid down
a ladder for them,

98
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:52,208
connecting the two worlds
together once more.

99
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,541
They climbed the ladder

100
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:58,250
until finally arriving
at the center of the sky.

101
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,750
There they found a single,

102
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:04,416
vast mirror standing
like a wall in their path.

103
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,541
Each girl saw her own
reflection in the mirror.

104
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,791
They heard Kumaria's voice say,

105
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,625
'Now, your friend is waiting
just on the other side

106
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,875
of that very door.

107
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,791
If you smash the 'you'
in the mirror to bits,

108
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:26,708
if you tear yourself apart, she
shall grant you a Promise Kiss.

109
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:31,458
But beware, this may
cost you your life.

110
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,791
I will ask you one more time.

111
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,750
Is your love the real thing?'

112
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,208
The girls stared at themselves

113
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,125
in the mirror for
a very long time."

114
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,458
Is that the end?

115
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,708
No, the story
doesn't have an ending.

116
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:53,750
A bear killed Mom. She never
got the chance to finish it.

117
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,125
How sad.

118
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,875
So, what would you do
if it was about you?

119
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:01,958
[SUMIKA]
Uh?

120
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,750
Y'know, that part in the story?

121
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:07,041
Would you risk your life
in order to break the mirror?

122
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,583
I'm not really sure.
Lemme think.

123
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:11,666
[KUREHA]
I would break it.

124
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,708
[SUMIKA]
Wha?

125
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,291
I'd shoot my reflection.

126
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,583
I'd shoot because
I would do anything

127
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,583
to prove my love was true.

128
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,208
[SUMIKA]
In that moment,

129
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,375
I decided I wouldn't
back down on love, either.

130
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,291
No matter what happened...

131
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,458
...I would do anything
to prove my love, too.

132
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:45,666
Now, ladies, it's time to decide
on the next evil to exclude.

133
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,833
Let's search evil!

134
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,625
[KATYUSHA]
Uh.

135
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,625
Oh, ladies.
I have bad news.

136
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,083
It seems we have a traitor
among our ranks.

137
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,875
Kureha Tsubaki was the one
set up to be the next evil.

138
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,958
Unfortunately,
before we can target her,

139
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,125
we must first
exclude the traitor.

140
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:34,791
I'm sure she agrees.
Right, Sumika Izumino?

141
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,541
[SUMIKA]
Kureha, I'm sorry.

142
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:45,666
I jumped into the storm myself,
and I did it willingly.

143
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:54,916
[SUMIKA] At the time, I thought
if I could prove my love,

144
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,791
I wouldn't mind getting hurt.

145
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,625
Even heartbroken.

146
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,958
But then, I realized
I was wrong.

147
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,166
It wouldn't be me the
Invisible Storm would break.

148
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,333
It would wind up being you.

149
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,583
The one I care about most.

150
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,208
[HARISHIMA]
Good, you wrote the letter.

151
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,333
[SUMIKA]
Uh.

152
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,291
Oh, Kaoru.

153
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,916
Thanks, great work.

154
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,833
I can take it now. That way I'll
be ready to give it to Kureha.

155
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,041
What's the problem?

156
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,583
[SUMIKA]
About the letter.

157
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,958
Would you mind
holding off a bit?

158
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:36,458
I'd like to wait until we

00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,958
The time has come for Us
to exclude the evil!

315
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,791
[STUDENTS]
Exclude!

316
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,500
Tell me, does evil get
to have any friends?

317
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,333
[STUDENTS]
No friends!

318
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,166
Tell me, does evil get crushed?

319
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,541
Crushed by the Invisible
Storm as punishment?

320
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,750
[STUDENTS]
Crushed as punishment!

321
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,750
She's excluded!

322
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,541
Good job, ladies. Kureha Tsubaki
just snapped like a twig!

323
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,541
[STUDENT A]
Yay!

324
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,250
[STUDENT B]
We did it!

325
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,500
[HARISHIMA]
Tragic.

326
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,750
You won't get any new friends.

327
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,708
On top of that,
you'll never be able to accept

328
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,333
Sumika Izumino's final gift.

329
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,541
Oh, what a pity. At least now
you know the emotion of love

330
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,166
is powerless and pointless.

331
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,166
[gasps]

332
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,500
No use for this anymore. Ha!

333
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,708
No! Sumika wrote that!

334
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,166
[SUMIKA]
Such a beautiful smile.

335
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,208
I want you to always
smile like that.

336
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,833
Like a flower. That's my love.

337
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:48,583
It's funny. Even if I had to
watch you from a distance,

338
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,541
I would be happy
just to see that smile.

339
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,458
Please, it's Sumika's love.

340
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,125
She gave to me!

341
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,708
[GINKO]
Growl!

342
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:03,000
[KUREHA gasping]

343
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:06,833
[GINKO groaning]

344
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,416
[KUREHA]
Wha--? Ginko?

345
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,958
Okay, everyone,
looks like the party's over.

346
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,458
Let's get out of here!

347
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,375
[yelping]

348
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:25,208
I won't. I'll never
back down on love!

349
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,916
[LULU panting]

350
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,416
Ginko!

351
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,291
[GINKO groaning]

352
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,791
Ginko, you dummy!

353
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,750
Lulu would have killed you
if you'd really died this time!

354
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,166
What were you thinking?

355
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,416
Why would you do that, Ginko?

356
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,750
You're a dummy, too! She did it
because she loves you!

357
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,083
She wha--? She loves me?

358
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,500
That's right.

359
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,708
Ginko loves you so much
look at what she's done for you.

360
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:58,416
Don't waste her love!
Please, don't waste it!

361
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:05,833
[SUMIKA] "Kureha, the girl
standing in front of you

362
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,041
is your new friend."

363
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,250
[gasps]

364
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,875
[KUREHA] Is this for real?
She's my new friend?

365
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,708
[SUMIKA] I think
I got here a little early.

366
00:23:57,791 --> 00:24:00,250
Still, I'm gonna have
to fix this place fast.

367
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,458
The flowerbed has to be
packed full of flowers again

368
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,375
before Kureha's birthday!

369
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,500
[MITSUKO]
Well, good morning, Sumika.

370
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,708
[SUMIKA gasping]

371
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:13,166
[FEMALE VOICE]
Shock!

372
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,333
Kuma shock!

373
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,583
[MITSUKO]
Such a lovely morning.

374
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,500
And I'm practically starving!

375
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,458
[SUMIKA]
Mitsuko, is that you?

376
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:21,791
[SUMIKA gasps]

377
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:22,833
[thud]

378
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,416
[MITSUKO]
Growl, growl, chomp, chomp.

379
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,125
Growl,growl, chomp, chomp.
Growl-growl...

380
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:30,083
[GINKO] That day,
I committed a serious crime.

381
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,958
I am a... criminal bear.
