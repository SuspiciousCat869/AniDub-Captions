1
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,791
It smells good.

2
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,958
You should smell the lily, too!

3
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,791
[GINKO]
Sniff, sniff.

4
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:57,333
All set, are you girls ready?

5
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,333
Try to smile pretty for me!

6
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:04,250
Okay, say cheese!

7
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:11,416
[GINKO] From the beginning,
we hated you,

8
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,291
but also, we loved you from
the beginning, as well.

9
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,583
All we wanted was to become
true friends with you,

10
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:21,125
so we had to cross the wall.

11
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:25,125
I had to have you all to myself.

12
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:30,291
[GINKO, LULU]
Yurikuma!

13
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,250
Yurikuma Arashi!

14
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:11,166
[GINKO]
Delicious smell. Slurp.

15
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:19,375
Good morning, Kureha.
Growl, growl.

16
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,875
Ginko, good morning.

17
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:28,916
Growl, growl. Lick!

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,625
[giggles]

19
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,541
Kureha, you're close to me.

20
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,291
[KUREHA] Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

21
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,000
[GINKO]
Heh.

22
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:43,791
Seriously! Why are you
in my house again?

23
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,666
I moved in, growl.

24
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,000
Wha-?

25
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:50,000
Growl, growl! All done!
We're finished moving in!

26
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,291
Wha--? Huh?

27
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,750
We're your roomies, now.

28
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,375
Bottoms up!

29
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,583
[BOTH]
New roomie noodles!

30
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,250
Come on, Kureha!

31
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,875
Bottoms up!

32
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,208
[LULU, GINKO]
New roomie noodles!

33
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,958
Get... out...

34
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,583
Get out of my house!

35
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,000
You have to leave, and,
by the way, it's not acceptable

36
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,958
to just move into someone's
house without asking!

37
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:30,875
Growl, growl. But, Kure-pie,
you ate your new roomie noodles!

38
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,541
So? I don't even get
what that means!

39
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,250
[STUDENT A]
Look, it's that one girl.

40
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,333
[STUDENT B]
Wha--? Oh, her.

41
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,208
She's totally bad luck
to her friends.

42
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,083
[STUDENT C]
It's worse than bad luck.

43
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,250
Students are disappearing,

44
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,500
and the missing girls all
happen to be from her class!

45
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,666
[KUREHA]
There, you heard them.

46
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,666
Getting close to me is bad luck.

47
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,500
It's true.

48
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,708
You're gonna get caught
up in the Invisible Storm.

49
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,791
Do you really believe that?

50
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,333
Yes.

51
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,625
If you two make friends with me,
you'll just wind up excluded

52
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,625
because that's
the law of this herd.

53
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,166
Understand now?

54
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,500
Leave me alone,
for your own sake.

55
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,666
Growl, growl! You're the one
who doesn't understand, silly.

56
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,583
Lulu told you, Ginko
and Lulu came here

57
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,208
to make friends with you!

58
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,166
[GINKO] We'll protect Kureha
from the Invisible Storm.

59
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,375
And we promise, we won't
back down on love. Growl, growl.

60
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:38,333
[KUREHA] I'm not lying! She was
a bear masquerading as a human!

61
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,708
[YURIIKA]
That's impossible.

62
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,041
[KUREHA]
I saw it.

63
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,125
Mitsuko turned into a bear
right in front of me!

64
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,625
She ate Sumika.
She killed my friend!

65
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,958
Mitsuko told me as much herself.

66
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,166
And then... And then, I--

67
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,625
I took my gun and
I aimed it right at her.

68
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,625
[YURIIKA]
Kureha.

69
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,333
That's enough of this story.

70
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,875
But it's true!

71
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,416
You poor darling.

72
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,166
The shock was just too much,
so you've clearly hallucinated.

73
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,916
No, it's real! I swear!

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,291
I won't force you to
do anything right away;

75
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,250
however, you will eventually
need to accept the reality

76
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,500
of the situation and let it go.

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,208
[YURIIKA]
I just remembered!

78
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:29,083
Next Sunday is your
birthday. It is, isn't it?

79
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,500
[KUREHA]
Yes.

80
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,583
Reia's little girl about
to be 17. I can't believe it.

81
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,083
Time certainly flies.

82
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,666
So, tell me, what would
you like to do this year?

83
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,583
Go out for dinner? Or did you
want a particular present?

84
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,833
[KUREHA]
No, not this year.

85
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,125
[YURIIKA]
Now that I think about it,

86
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,333
you know your mother's pendant?

87
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,875
She loved it so much.

88
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,458
It was a present for her
when she turned seventeen.

89
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,208
I'm actually the one
who gave it to her.

90
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,916
Really, it was from you?

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,250
[YURIIKA] Yes. It was a symbol
of a promise between friends.

92
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,500
We pledged to each other that
we would never forget love.

93
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,583
You pledged to
never forget love?

94
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,916
We sure did.

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,916
As long as you
don't forget love,

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,291
you'll never, ever
be truly alone.

97
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,458
And, if you don't
give up on love,

98
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:20,000
even if you lose something,
you'll never be invisible.

99
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,416
Of course, it's
important to know

100
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,083
that love can cause
us pain, as well.

101
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,541
For example, when we
remember time that's been lost.

102
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,208
Remember time that's been lost?

103
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,333
Sumika.

104
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,958
Whenever we feel that pain,

105
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,750
we should try to focus
on something else

106
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,750
and not be too hard
on ourselves.

107
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,750
Kureha, I think what you
probably need right now

108
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,250
more than anything
is a new friend.

109
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,625
A new friend? Seriously?

110
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,958
[YURIIKA]
Yes.

111
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,208
Try allowing yourself to
get close to someone else.

112
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,083
I can't do it.

113
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,333
[YURIIKA]
What?

114
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,750
I don't want to get
close to someone else.

115
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,791
Sumika is my only friend.

116
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,500
I'll never give up on love,
no matter what!

smell all that delicious!

tastes like love to her.

What tastes like love?

125
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,208
Yes. It's something
which can't be destroyed

by any storm, or bear, or human.

that's for real?

That's why I came.
Why I crossed the wall.

we talked it over this morning.

Everyone agreed
we've been really cruel.

We know we're in the wrong,

and we're beyond sorry
for what we've done.

make it up to you.

You all excluded Sumika!

None of you have the
right to be forgiven!

If this is some sort of game,
you girls better finish it,

to celebrate your

00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:02,583
Ginko and Lulu are her friends,
not those stinky girls!

You agree, yeah?

Uh.

326
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,375
[HARISHIMA] We don't have much
time before Kureha's birthday.

Ladies, thank you for working
so hard these past few days.

331
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,125
Because of everyone here,

332
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,958
Kureha Tsubaki has
started to believe

333
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,375
that we are interested
in being her friends.

334

We only need to endure
her a little longer.

335
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,833
At this moment, we will
confirm our feelings

336
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,916
and make a final decision.

Who is the evil we must exclude?

[HARISHIMA]
Select!

We have chosen Kureha Tsubaki
as the evil to exclude.

Turns out she is
an invisible girl.

Meaning we can
eat her, after all!

I wish to eat her.

That way I can save Kureha
from the Invisible Storm.

Excuse me, but doesn't everyone

all in the name of
"saving Kureha Tsubaki."

359
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,250
Is that correct?

360
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,416
[GINKO, LULU]
Yes.

They're guilty, Your Honor!

362

Ginko Yurishiro, answer this
question honestly, please.

363
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,916
What is it that you want?

364
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,208
And don't say to save Kureha.
That's just an excuse.

365
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,500
In fact, isn't it true,
all you really want

366
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:17,125
is to make sure you are Kureha
Tsubaki's one and only friend?

[LIFE BEAUTY]
Objection! Speculation.

The prosecutor is being
ruled by his personal sadism!

For your information,

Ginko just wants to give back
the love she got from Kure-pie!

She wants a Promise Kiss.

Ginko Yurishiro, please answer
the prosecutor's question.

00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:43,000
Okay. The truth is. I want
to have Kureha all to myself.

I want to be friends
with her again,

and I want to have
Kureha's love again.

That's the only
reason I came here.

380
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,125
That's the reason
I crossed the wall

381
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,666
and dragged Lulu
into it with me.

382

But, Ginko, Lulu wanted
to cross the wall with you.

It doesn't matter, though!

it takes for love!

to committing a crime.
