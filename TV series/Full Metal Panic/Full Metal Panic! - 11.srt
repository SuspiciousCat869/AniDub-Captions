Why do you ask?

00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,833
Does it look like
I'm feeling better?

I guess you're not dying yet.

You look like a

That's right.

How people see him is up to you.

Your master, Seiji Takechi,
exists only in you now.

Your behavior will ultimately
determine his truth.

That's all.

You're a strange bird.

28

You act more like a
priest than a soldier.

29

I'm sure it would suit you well

It's not too late.

Yes, it is.

37
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,250
You've been my enemy since
the beginning of this ordeal.

38
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,083
The reason I didn't kill you
was nothing but a whim.

Once I learn nhow much you know

I'm not telling you anything.

43
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,125
In that case, it looks like
I'll have to probe Miss Chidori

00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,708
and Miss Testarossa
on the subject, won't I?

orders to pack up my bags

have decided to release first?

I guess I'd have to go
with the girl I loved.

accepted my warm love

a caring heart.

Nonsense.

All right. Open up
the glove compartment.

Tell me why you didn't take
the medication in the aircraft.

I'm sorry. The pills
fell into the toilet.

They looked dirty

so I didn't take them
and flushed them instead.

And because of that,
you got caught,

spend time, effort,

we can go, you guys?

This is the
shortest route there.

If we go through Ariake,
we add 25 minutes to the trip.

And if we go through Ginza,
you'll crush the taxis

Or trying to show off
and assert myself.

Assert yourself?

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,708
How exactly?

132
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,958
[TELETHA] I jumped into the
mêlée in the school yard,

133
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,958
ignoring Sergeant Sagara's order

134
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,541
and subverting his
judgment as the expert.

135
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:39,416
I've never made such a stupid
choice in my entire life.

136
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,416
I acted stupidly to
try and rescue you,

137

because you were already
doing something stupid.

Oh. I was? Then why...?

139
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,958
Because... By the way,

140
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,375
aren't you scared
at all, Miss Chidori?

141
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:56,666
I don't know. I mean,
of course I'm scared, but...

142
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,791
...I can't help wanting
to strike back

143
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,958
when I see something scary
standing right there

144
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,250
in front of me, you know.

145
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,625
Strike back?

146
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,041
Yeah, if there's someone
attacking you or something,

147
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,583
what would you call that person?

148
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,500
An enemy, right?

149
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,791
And I don't mean just the people

carrying guns and
stuff like that.

You still have plenty of 'em
in normal everyday life.

152

If you have an enemy like that,

153
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,458
you have to stand up
and do something.

154
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,000
I guess that's just
the way I choose

to take care of these things.
You know what I'm saying?

Can we shake them?

Well, let's see what
this thing can do.

167
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,375
[POLICEMAN]
This is the Aomi squad car 6.

168
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,916
We're chasing a
small pickup truck

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,041
that broke through
the checkpoint.

[DISPATCHER]
This is headquarters. We copy.

171
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,375
[KANAME] It was back when
I was in junior high.

172
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,416
Oh.

173
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,375
I just came back
home from overseas,

174
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,791
and people looked down on me.

175
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,333
Maybe because I'd gotten used

176
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,375
to saying whatever was
on my mind all the time.

177
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,500
I think maybe I was
partially to blame

178
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,000
for the whole mess,
but it was so bad.

179
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,750
They were spiteful
and played real dirty.

180
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:25,208
It was so awful.
I wanted to kill myself.

181
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,625
Did you ever fight
back against them?

182
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,291
Oh, yeah. Well, as soon
as I started high school,

183
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,625
the problem disappeared.

184
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,958
So as long as that nutcase
Sousuke settles down,

185
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,916
I don't think I'll
have anymore complaints.

Is Mr. Sagara bothering
you that much?

188
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,458
Yeah, he's pretty bad.

189
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:47,541
He never uses common sense,
so he ends up causing disasters.

190
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,916
I understand he
doesn't mean it, but,

191
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,333
it always seems to
make things worse.

192
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,458
He does try hard,
awkward as he is.

193
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,416
I feel like I have
to look after him.

194
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,333
I admit, he is a
pretty strange guy.

00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,583
coming from you, Seina.

319
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,833
What exactly is
wrong with you people?

320
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,250
You'd have to be crazy
to pilot that thing.

321
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,541
[TAKUMA]
Crazy?

322
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:40,416
Because we're terrorists,
Miss Testarossas?

323
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,333
[TAKUMA]
You see, I'm not expecting

324
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,541
to get anything out
of this personally.

325
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,250
It's really just a
form of expression.

326
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,333
I'm just expressing my opinion.

327
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,208
Well, something like that.

328
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,625
One year from now,

329
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:57,791
most people will have already
forgotten all about it.

330
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,875
Just like they
forgot Seiji Takechi.

331
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,041
[TAKUMA]
That's right. However,

332
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,666
I don't really care
what happens after this.

333
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,250
I'm one of the
few chosen soldiers.

334
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,625
Once I take my seat
inside Behemoth,

335
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,625
it will be invincible.

336
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,875
I'll destroy many things
and kill many people.

337
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:20,208
Then my sister will be happy,
and I'll be satisfied.

338
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,666
Takuma, please stop it!

339
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,750
There's still time for
you to turn back now!

340
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,875
You have no right
to call me Takuma.

341
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:29,166
My sister's the only
one allowed to do that.

342
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,041
Sorry, but it's too late,
Miss Testarossa.

343
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:35,833
To tell you the truth,
I kinda liked you,

344
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,000
but it's time to say goodbye.

345
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,250
[ALL gasp, scream]

346
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,916
[POLICE] Quick, somebody
call for backup!

347
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Don't move!

348
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,041
It's about to start.

349
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,708
Takuma, hurry up

350
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,291
and climb into the
Behemoth, right away.

Heh!

Sousuke!

00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,000
Sergeant Sagara!

[MAN groans]

357
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,875
[KANAME gasps]
Behind you!

358
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,375
[groans]

359
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,833
Takuma!

[KANAME sobs]

00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,250
[SOUSUKE]
Kaname...

362
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,791
[KANAME]
I was worried about you!

363
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:23,958
[SOUSUKE]
Sorry.

364
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,125
I was frightened half to death.

365
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,458
I apologize.

366
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,791
Idiot.

367
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,125
[KURZ]
Hey, hey, what about my role?

368
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,708
[KALININ]
Thank you for your hard work.

369
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,208
[SEINA]
Hurry and get in.

370
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,916
But I'm... I'm injured, sister.

371
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,291
There's no need
for you to cry out

372
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,250
over such a tiny wound.

373
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,958
[TAKUMA]
But, I can't do it.

374
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,041
If you can't climb in
and pilot that machine,

375
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,500
then you are worthless.

376
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:52,750
If you run away,
I won't need you.

377
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,750
Now, or ever.

[POLICE shouting]

This doesn't look good at all.

00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,750
Uh, guys, I think
we're in trouble here.

382
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,666
Let's go. We'd better
get out of here.

383
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,291
No, Takuma! Wait!

384
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,708
You shouldn't be
piloting that monster!

385
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:42,750
If you don't get out,

386
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,541
the machine will
take total control!

387
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,958
[TAKUMA]
I understand now, sister.

[BEHEMOTH A.I.] Behemoth is
sinking due to its weight.

Please start the Lambda Driver.

00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,875
I'm heading out now.
Keep watching me.

I only hope I make you
happy and proud of me.

[BEHEMOTH A.I.]
Lambda Driver first function.

393
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,958
Initialization confirmed.

394
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,833
Goodbye then, sister.

400
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,708
But what about you?

00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,250
Don't worry,
I won't die so easily.

402
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,750
Now go.

[WAS-1]
Is that the target?

Don't know. Where's the AS?

awakening inside me again.
