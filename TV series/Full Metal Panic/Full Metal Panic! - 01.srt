registered in this country,

00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,875
Hey, mister, you better
stop right there!

158
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,166
Give me that!

159
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,166
Hmm... C'est la vie.

160
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,291
What do you mean
"C'est la vie," Kyoko?!

161
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,916
I mean, you're the one who set
me up on that stupid date!

162
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,041
I did it because
someone asked me to.

163
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,416
Well then...

164
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,708
If someone asked you to sell
me to a foreign country,

165
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,041
would you do it, Kyoko?
I'm really curious.

166
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,750
[KYOKO]
Hmm... Yeah, maybe.

167
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,000
Oh my god... Just what I need.

168
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,291
[TEACHER] Your first day here
and you're already in trouble?

169
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,875
I'll have to keep this toy.

170
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,125
Ma'am, what you have
in your hands is no toy.

171
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,750
That gun is loaded
with splat bullets

172
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,875
and it has an incredibly
high stopping power.

173
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,875
It's very dangerous.

174
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,541
Okay... a military maniac.
What a weirdo.

175
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,750
[KYOKO]
Yeah, he is...

176
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,875
Where did my idol go...?

00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,708
[TEACHER]
Okay, listen up, everybody.

178
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,291
I have a new classmate
to introduce to you.

180
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,791
[TEACHER] Now, Sosuke, why don't
you introduce yourself?

181
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,333
Sergeant Sosuke Sagara

182
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,791
[STUDENT 1]
Sue-John Sautéed Cigar?

183
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,291
No, dude, look at him!

184
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,833
He's like one of those samurai
shoguns from the old days!

185
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,750
When you say "Sergeant",
you mean like in the military?

[TEACHER]
Be quiet, everyone.

187

Let's all wait
until he's finished.

188
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,833
Please, Mr. Sagara,
no more jokes.

189
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,208
I... I'm incredibly sorry.

190
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,041
I'm Sosuke Sagara.

191
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,666
Everyone, please disregard
the Sergeant part

192
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,166
as it was my mistake. That's it.

193

[STUDENT 1] Hey, why don't
you sing us a song?

Is that everything?

00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,875
Yes, that's all there is.

196
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,583
Questions for Mr. Sagara?

197
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,250
Yeah, could you please tell us

198
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,625
what country
you're from, Sosuke?

199
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:49,333
[SOUSUKE]
Yes. Afghanistan, Lebanon,

200
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:53,083
Cambodia, Iraq, Columbia.

201
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,333
Well...

202
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,666
It seems like you've
been overseas

203
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,458
for quite some time now.

204
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,791
[STUDENT 2]
Do you have a hobby?

205
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,291
[STUDENT 3]
I bet it's model guns.

[STUDENTS laughing]

207
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,291
No, I like fishing and reading.

208
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,166
[STUDENT 4]
What kind of books do you read?

209
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,708
Right. Primarily technical
books and some periodicals.

210
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,541
I often find myself reading
through James Almanac.

211
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:17,208
[SOUSUKE] Soldier of Fortune
is also an enjoyable read.

212
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:21,666
And I subscribe to Harris
Publisher's Arm Slave Monthly.

213
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,000
Which reminds me,

214
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,791
I have also read the
Japanese publication AS Fan.

215
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,791
I was quite impressed with
the attention to detail

216
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:32,250
and the volume of information
it contained. A good magazine.

217
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,083
Lately, I've been getting into
books about Maritime affairs.

218
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,875
I recently purchased
ten new editions

219
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,750
of the Naval Institute Press,
which I would consider...

220
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,500
I must be boring you.

221
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,875
Um, hey. Tell us who your
favourite musician is, Sousuke!

00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,000
[KANAME]
He's definitely a weirdo.

227
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:28,333
Didja hear him in class?
Wasn't that messed up?

228
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,208
And during recess,
he kept pacing

229
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,708
back and forth in the
corridor by the classroom.

Oh, you're serious?

Well, then, stop watching him.

234
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:45,083
Ah! W-Watching?!
I'm not watching that maniac!

235
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,166
It's just... It's just that his
eyes alwasys seem to meet mine!

236
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,875
He's looking at me!

237
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,291
And then he tries
to play it off like

238
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,083
it's some kind of
coincidence or something

239

but it's so obvious.

Oh, why me?

241
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,208
Well, maybe...
he thinks you're pretty?

Well, thanks, Kyoko.

of a bonafied pervert!

Isn't it totally obvious?

for treating you so
roughly, Miss Chidori.

It was never my inention to
inflict bodily harm on you,

or your friends,
or to cause such a disaster.

At my old school,

I was an active

Who the heck is this guy?!

314
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:01,416
He's been stuck
to me all day long!

315
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,208
Is he stalking me or what?

316
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:05,041
On top of that,
strange things keep happening

317
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,458
one after the other!
What's going on?!

318
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:10,958
Next Full Metal Panic, Episode
2: "I Want to Protect You."

00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,041
Any light you can shed
on this problem, Sousuke?

320
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,625
[SOUSUKE]
There's no problem.
