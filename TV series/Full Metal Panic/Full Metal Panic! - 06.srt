I wanna go home...

Oh man, you think Kaname's okay?

4
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,291
They told me she got
on board another plane.

00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,791
[KYOKO] Aw, Kazama, don't cry.
I know you're worried

6
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:20,041
about Sousuke, but I'm
sure that he'll be fine.

7
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,916
No, I-I'm just so happy

8
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,208
I got to see a
real M9 in battle!

00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,875
I could get hit by a
stray bullet right now

We've got another enemy
battalion closing in.

[MELISSA] Wait! What about Urzu
6? Kurz hasn't contacted me yet.

16
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,250
Neither has Sousuke,
nor the girl...

[CO-PILOT]
This is Teiwaz 12.

18
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,791
Out by the north river, we
found the wreckage of an M9.

19
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,583
We think it's Urzu 6's.

Can you repeat that?
Is the operator safe?!

21
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,208
[CO-PILOT]
Cannot confirm. Too much smoke.

22
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,250
[MELISSA]
Find him! And Sousuke!

I wish I could, ma'am,
but we don't have the time

to look for either of
them at this point.

a minute, I'll do a--

But, sir!

00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,166
[KALININ] The reinforcements
have just crossed the bridge.

Our interceptors
are on their way.

31
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:26,041
You have one minute
to get out of there.

32
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:30,166
[KALININ] Teiwaz 12, shoot all
the munitions you have left

33
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,041
into the M9's wreckage.

34
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,916
Don't let them have one
shard of one screw.

Teiwaz 12, roger.

Absolutely useless.

It stops working
after I use it once?

[TERRORIST]
It's me. I got a strange report

46
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,041
from a firefighter.

47
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,458
So spill.

48
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,000
[TERRORIST] He's saying
that he saw 2 people

49
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,541
near the westside
fence not too long ago.

50

A man a young woman.
Both of them

51
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,958
ran away and disappeared.

all right, Sousuke?

We're not safe yet.

55

But we didn't have
any other option.

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,500
We had to leave the base.

there's a little case

inside the pocket
on my jacket. Find it.

Yes, but I'm lucky. No damage
to vital organs or arteries.

00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:25,791
So it should, in no way,
affect how I carry out my duty.

[KANAME]
Your duty?

We'd better move.
They're getting closer.

Well, the important thing is,
all I can think of now

is finding a way to send you
back home safe and sound.

I'll be back in time
with Kurz and Sousuke!

[KALININ] You want me to risk

and its 250 passengers?

They're my men, Lt. Commander.

That makes them
my responsibility.

It's raining outside.

The ECS invisible mode
won't help you any.

104
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,000
There's no chance
of finding them.

How can you be so damn
official about everything?!

00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,750
Because I'm required
to be that way.

me how long we can wait, right?

We cannot afford another
minute right now.

The enemy's armed patrol
boats are getting close.

115

[KALININ]
You're right, Madam Captain.

116
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,041
But I do want to rescue
Sagara and the others.

117
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,625
Yes.

118
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:23,083
There is a remote possibility
that Sgt. Weber is still alive.

119
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,291
[TELETHA] Well, if I can
manage to spare a few minutes

120
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:29,416
on the surface, what plan
would you suggest we follow?

121
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,791
Can we really do that?

122
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:31,875
[TELETHA]
It would be impossible

123
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,916
if this were a
regular submarine.

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,250
If my assessment of
the enemy is correct,

125
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,916
we will have to
deploy that thing

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,416
just to keep pace with him.

127
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,791
[TELETHA]
What thing?

128
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:46,083
[KALININ]
ARX-7... Arbalest.

129
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,625
[SOUSUKE]
Did that silver one beat you?

130
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,458
Yeah... but I have no
idea what happened.

131
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:56,125
I lured it in close and
blasted it close with a 57mm.

132
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,250
I thought I killed the
bastard, but I ended up

133
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,666
getting blown to pieces.

134
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,208
Is it possible
that they detonated

135
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,833
a fougade underneath you?

136
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,666
No, I don't think
that's what it was.

137
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,625
It was like someone hit me
with an invisible hammer...

138
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:09,208
[groans]

139
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,250
[KANAME]
Kurz!

140
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,166
That's enough.
Don't speak anymore.

141
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,833
[thunder rumbles]

142
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,625
[SOUSUKE]
If we make it across this field,

143
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,166
we should be able
to reach the sea.

144
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,041
Make it across?

145
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,291
But if we go walking around
in the open, then--

146
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,166
[SOUSUKE]
Yes, without any cover,

147
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,083
they're likely to find us.

148
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,458
So then, uh...
What do we do?

149
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,375
[SOUSUKE]
Chidori?

150
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,791
Yes?

151
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,625
[SOUSUKE] I was thinking about
this on the way up here.

152
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,583
There's quite some distance
between us and the beach.

153
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,958
We can't make our
escape together.

154
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,416
[KANAME]
So...

155
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
[SOUSUKE] So Kurz and I
will stay here and create

156
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,708
enough of a distubance to
attract the enemy's attention.

157
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,500
We will try to buy you
as much time as we can.

158
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,333
What does that--

159
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,833
[gasps]

160
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,083
[SOUSUKE] Take this radio
and make a run for the beach.

161
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,000
It's range is somewhat limited,

162
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:02,208
but if our allies are in the
area, they should respond.

163
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,416
I have to escape alone...?

164
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,666
[SOUSUKE] Don't worry about it.
Our duty and number 1 priority

165
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,708
is to guard your life.
It is your right

166
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,541
to make it out of
this place alive.

167
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,458
[SOUSUKE]
So go.

168
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,666
[thunder cracks]

169
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,291
[KANAME]
I'm not going!

170
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,750
[gasps]

171
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,208
Chidori...

172
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,416
I don't wanna go! Got it?

173
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,375
God, Sousuke,
you're such an idiot!

174
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,291
Are you thinking, like,
"I don't care when I die,"

175
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,791
or some other
stupid nonsense?!

176
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,666
Is that what's running through
that thick head of yours?!

177
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,208
Uh...

178
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,416
What, do you think it makes you
cool or something like that?

179
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,625
Uh...

180
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:45,875
Even if you're ready to
die without stopping

181
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,958
to think how I would feel,
I want you to know

182
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:51,041
that having my life saved by
some moody military maniac

183
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,833
like you isn't gonna make
me any happier, okay?!

184
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:54,500
Uh...!

185
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,041
So are we clear?!

186
00:09:56,125 --> 00:10:00,375
[pants]

187
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,833
[SOUSUKE]
Uh...

188
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,791
Well I guess you're
still missing my point.

189
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,500
What I'm trying to
say is that we should

190
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,958
put our heads together
and think about

191
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,333
ways that we can all survive.

192
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,791
You really shouldn't
give up so easily, Sousuke!

193
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,500
I'm sorry, but
there's no other way!

194
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,333
We should at least
give it some thought!

195
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,625
I don't know...

196
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,208
What if we started a
fire here, let it spread,

197
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,750
and took advantage of the
confusion and ran away.

198
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:21,625
Something...

199
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,500
There's always an answer.

200
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,666
Look, please. I'm the
professional here.

201
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,375
I considered all the
different scenarios

202
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,541
and chose the best idea out of
all the ones I came up with.

203
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,041
Don't you get it?!

204
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,875
I don't wanna do it,
and that's final!

205
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,375
Just shut up and go!

206
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,625
[gasps]

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,125
If I don't go, you'll shoot...?

208
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,458
That's right. It is better
for you to die here

209
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,375
than to be caught by the
enemy and turned into

210
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,000
one of the living dead!

211
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,375
[giggles]

212
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,375
Look, Sousuke.
You said to trust you,

213
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,750
so I'm taking you at your word.

214
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,958
I thought I could bear
anything out here as long as

215
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:12,041
you were with me. It didn't
matter how much I was worn out,

216
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,125
or how painful it was.

217
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,583
Even if I thought
I was gonna die,

218
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,750
I thought, I could handle it.

219
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,666
So please don't say you're
gonna go and get killed.

220
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,083
We should go back together,

221
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,458
Sousuke...

222
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,250
Kaname...

223
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,416
Sousuke...

224
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,458
[coughs]

225
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,291
[SOUSUKE, KANAME gasp]

226
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,166
[SOUSUKE]
Kurz!

227
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,875
Were you awake this whole time?!

228
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,625
[laughs]

229
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,916
Face it, Sousuke,
you just lost a battle.

230
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,041
The girl said she
doesn't like your plan.

231
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,833
Your idea is
officially rejected.

232
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,208
But, I--

233
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,708
I'm gonna have to vote
in favor of Kaname's plan.

234
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,250
Starting a wildfire's
a good idea.

235
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,666
And what a stroke of luck,
it's stopped raining.

236
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,083
[KANAME]
Mm-hm!

237
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,875
[SOUSUKE] It's stupid! We would
give away our position!

238
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,083
It's too risky!

239
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,500
But if there are friendly
airplanes flying around,

240
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,125
then they could see
it from the sky,

241
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,791
and then they could make a
quick landing and pick us up!

242
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,333
We're under enemy airspace,
so it'll never happen!

243
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,916
--[KURZ] Wait a minute!
--[KANAME] Huh?

244
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,958
From the sky...
0248 hours...

245
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,041
So what?

246
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,083
[KURZ]
Before I left for the attack,

247
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,041
I was shown a sattelite photo.

248
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,583
A photo of the base!

249
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:33,833
The time was... uh...
yesterday, at 1530 hours!

250
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,791
A spy sattelite! Kaname,
babe, you're the greatest!

251
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,500
Um, what's going on?

252
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,791
Our spy sattelites
go through the same place

253
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,500
in their orbit above the
Earth every 12 hours.

254
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,125
Which means in about 40 minutes,

255
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,375
it should be making its
way around here again!

256
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,875
Well, as long as this
cloud cover hangs around,

257
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,625
it'll be difficult,
if not impossible,

258
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,916
for the sattelite to
spot us or the fire.

259
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,541
Make no mistake, we're
looking at a long shot.

260
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,875
But still...

261
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,958
It's worth it, taking the
risk. Don't ya think so?

262
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,625
That's affirmative.

263
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,916
Where're you going?

264
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,750
I have to go and find some oil.

265
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,750
Lighter fluid would only help
us start a small campfire.

266
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,208
Okay, but don't
do anything dumb.

267
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,291
Might as well.

268
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,666
We'll probably screw up
sooner or later.

269
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,916
You're going alone?

270
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,291
[SOUSUKE]
Yes. You stay here.

271
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,583
[KANAME]
Sousuke. Please promise me...

272
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,166
...that you'll most
definitely come back.

273
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:29,375
[SOUSUKE] Yes, ma'am.
I promise I'll be back.

274
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:41,000
[thunder cracks]

275
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,958
[KANAME]
So... You don't know either.

276
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:47,833
That's right.

277
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,083
Our commander ordered us

278
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,958
to keep a close watch
on you and protect you

279
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,208
from danger. We were
just carrying out

280
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,958
the orders we were given.
What we weren't given

281
00:13:56,041 --> 00:14:00,000
was any information on why
you've been targeted.

282
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,750
Right...

283
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,291
[KURZ] What did they
do to you in there?

284
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,958
I wish I could tell you.

285
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,458
They made me drink a glass
of something they said was

286
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,833
a vitamin drink, and then I
had to watch this weird video

287
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,541
that I couldn't understand.

288
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,041
Video?

289
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,500
All sorts of letters kept
changing one after the other.

290
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,708
Base material of the
invertebral disk damper,

291
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,708
reaction catalyst for the
palladium reactor...

292
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:44,041
ECS invisible mode wasn't ready
for widespread deployment,

293
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,916
a laser screen
oscillation system

294
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,375
was bearing way too many loads
and smelled like ozone...

295
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,541
Wait a second, how the hell
do you know all these words?!

296
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,958
Huh? What words? Did I
say something just now?

297
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,416
Military personnel are the
only people on the planet

298
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,166
who should know the names of
AS partsor the weak point

You... You say that, but I...

301
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,625
[KURZ] Then where in the world
did you learn this stuff?

302
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:10,333
I don't know. I'm not supposed
to know these words...

303
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,500
...but somehow I just do.

304
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,333
Since... before I was
born they told me.

305
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,250
I... remember they
called it black technology

306
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,375
or something like that.

316
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,208
We can forget about it for now.

317
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,833
[groans]

318
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,250
[KANAME]
Are you all right? Does it hurt?

319
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,250
I'm a lot of help.
I can't move a damn muscle

320
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,333
now that you really
need me to. What a loser.

321
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,000
That's not true! You've
already done so much for me.

322
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,750
Shit! If only I had a
little bit more energy left.

323
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,583
Save your strength.

324
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:35,125
If I... could just...

325
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,333
[KANAME gasps]

326
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,416
Did you have any luck?

327
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,833
I dunno.

328
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,000
I hope our allies noticed
the sign, but like I said,

329
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,625
it was a long shot.

330
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,125
Huh?! Kurz?!

331
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,541
What happened?!
Are you okay?!

332
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,333
[KANAME]
Oh, I think he'll be fine.

333
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,625
He's resting his eyes after
wandering all night.

334
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,250
So what happened to him?

335
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,375
[KANAME]
Hey.

336
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,750
[SOUSUKE]
Hm?

337
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:29,041
[KANAME] If we... If we
make it back home safely,

338
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,125
what do you think you'll
do when we get there?

339
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,791
Most likely start
on my next mission.

340
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,166
[KANAME] Are you saying
you'll go somewhere else?

341
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,875
You're not coming
to school anymore?

342
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,083
[SOUSUKE] I suppose not.
Being a school student

343
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,125
gets in the way of
a soldier's duty,

344
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,291
especially if his
duty is elsewhere.

345
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:48,791
I'll simply disappear,
just as my training dictates.

346
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,750
[KANAME]
I see...

347
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:51,583
[SOUSUKE gasps]

348
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:52,416
[KANAME]
What?!

349
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,875
[SOUSUKE]
They found us!

350
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,416
They followed you.

351
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,083
[SOUSUKE]
It was only a matter of time.

352
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,166
It's all over now.

353
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,625
I think you're right.

354
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:12,583
You know, I once saw a movie
like this a long time ago.

355
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:16,000
Two guys like you,
a gloomy guy and a flirt,

356
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,041
run away from the west
coast of the states

357
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,208
to a place in South America.

358
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:25,000
At the end, they get surrounded
by a whole bunch of enemies.

359
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,333
[KURZ] Yeah, I think
I've seen that movie.

360
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,666
[KANAME]
Huh?

361
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,208
[KURZ] I seem to remember
the pretty-haired one

362
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,708
was very nice to the flirt, too.

363
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,583
That's the one, right?

364
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,541
Then what?

365
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,750
What, what?

366
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,750
What happens to these
two guys at the end?

367
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,958
[KANAME] Um... I dunno.
They go out to face the enemy

368
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,375
with their guns blazing,
and... that's it.

369
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,625
[SOUSUKE]
Is that so?

370
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,708
In old black and white
movies, it used to be

371
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,500
that the main characters
would die a lot of the time.

372
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,458
There oughta be
a rule, you know?

373
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,500
'Cause movies should have...
a happy ending!

374
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,458
[gasps]

375
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,875
[gasps]

376
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:09,041
[KANAME] I see! I guess
this is the real thing, huh?!

377
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:13,208
[KURZ] Guess so! What d'ya say
we do that cool ending scene?

378
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,458
[KANAME] Sure! We'll make it
a touching celluloid moment.

379
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:17,166
[SOUSUKE]
Chidori?

380
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,708
[KANAME]
Huh?

381
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:22,000
[SOUSUKE] I'm sorry but, we
won't be going back together.

382
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,458
[KANAME]
I don't have any regrets.

383
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:28,500
I'm glad I met you,
Sousuke Sagara.

384
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,916
[KURZ]
Well, shall we go?

385
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,291
Hold on!

386
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,041
Is that a...?

387
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,125
M9.

388
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,500
[SOUSUKE]
No, it's not!

389
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,375
Wait, Sousuke!

390
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,500
So then, who's in
there?! Is it Mao?!

391
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,250
[COMPUTER]
Initializing voice print.

392
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,416
Your name and ID number, please.

393
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,208
Sergeant Sousuke Sagara, B3128!

394
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,916
[COMPUTER] Voice print complete.
Sergeant Sagara confirmed.

395
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,416
Awaiting command.

396
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,958
[SOUSUKE] Close the hatch.
Start the controls at Mode 4.

397
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,166
Bi-lateral angle at 3.5.

398
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,750
[COMPUTER]
Roger.

399
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,541
[KALININ] Sgt. Sagara,
this tape recording was made

400
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,958
to play in the event that
you successfully joined up

401
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,416
with ARX-7, AKA Arbalest.

402
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,833
Arbalest?

403
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,208
[KALININ] Currently, de Danaan
is running at full steam

404
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,666
towards shore under
strict radio silence.

405
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,000
We plan to follow the
shore closely and escape

406
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,625
after we pick you up.

407
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,208
We will be on the surface
for 1 minute's duration

408
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,500
at 0430 hours. Come to
the desintated point

409
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,666
by that time however you can.

410
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,666
By the way, the AI's
call sign is Al.

411
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,250
Be sure to bring it back

412
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:56,125
as it is a very expensive test
machine. That is all. Good luck.

413
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,666
[AL A.I.] Enemy AS, estimated
5 units approaching.

414
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,833
They're coming...

415
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,208
[KURZ]
Sousuke...

416
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,666
You're Al, correct?

417
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,416
[AL A.I.]
Yes, Sergeant.

418
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,750
We've got just one minute.

419
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,750
--[AL A.I.] Roger.
--[SOUSUKE] Let's go!

420
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,833
[BOTH gasp]

421
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:02,541
[KANAME] Something has awakened
inside me. What is this?

422
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,583
A me I've never known?

423
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,666
Is it the power
of the Whispered?

424
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,750
Next Full Metal Panic,
Episode 7: "Boy Meets Girl."

425
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:11,666
Sousuke!

426
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,666
[blow lands]

427
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,666
[SOUSUKE]
That... hurt.
