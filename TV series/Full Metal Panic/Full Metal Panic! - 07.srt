1
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,875
[PILOT 1] Twelve o'clock!
Enemy AS 1 approaching!

2
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:01,708
M9?

3
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,166
[PILOT 2]
I can't confirm!

4
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,666
[PILOT 1] Don't stand
by yourself! Surround it!

5
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,791
[PILOT 2]
I can't lock on!

6
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,083
[PILOT 3]
Right! Go right!

7
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,583
[PILOT 1] Calm down,
there's only one of 'em!

8
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,500
He's over there!

9
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,291
[panting]

10
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,583
[screaming]

11
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:52,958
Sousuke, no!

12
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:56,708
That's it.

13
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:57,958
[SOUSUKE gasps]

14
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,125
It's that silver AS...

15
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:17,875
[KANAME gasps]

16
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,208
[GAURON chuckles]

17
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,791
You're a nimble one, eh?

18
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,625
[GAURON]
Kashim!

19
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,000
[KANAME]
So, who's leading the fight?

20
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,458
[KURZ] If it was a regular
battle, they should be even.

21
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,666
But that silver AS
is somethin' else.

22
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,000
It's got some kind of mysterious
hidden trick going for it.

23
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,833
It bounced my cannon ball
right back at me

24
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,583
and toasted my M9.

25
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,833
I wonder what magic he's using.

26
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,000
Magic, huh?

27
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,291
No, I'm afraid it isn't that.

28
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:11,208
This guy isn't using magic,
but rather, technology.

29
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,541
The enemy has it,

30
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,833
and it's an integral part
of his mecha's defenses.

31
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,125
K-Kaname...? What do you--

32
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,666
He'll lose.

33
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,875
Sousuke is going to lose.

34
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,250
If it keeps going this way...

35
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,416
[GAURON gasps]

36
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,791
[SOUSUKE yells]

37
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,041
[SOUSUKE growls]

38
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,000
What in the--?!

39
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,375
[GAURON chuckles]

40
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,833
[KURZ]
OF course, that's what it was!

41
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,416
It wasn't a fougade

42
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,208
and no reactive armor for the
shell to bounce off of either.

43
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,333
He's just got himself
an invisible wall.

44
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,583
[KANAME]
Oh my god...

45
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,375
[SOUSUKE gasps]

46
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,041
How...?

47
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,833
What, no damage?! You mean
even after that impact?

48
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,791
What's that?
What was that noise, Al?

49
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,333
[AL A.I.] Executing main
system boot-up wizard.

50
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,666
Twenty seconds and counting
before system release.

51
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,833
Hold on... what are
you doing, Al? Al!

52
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:01,166
[GAURON] A dud? Huh,
I guess I should reload.

53
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,833
[AL A.I.] Lamda Driver
initialization complete.

54
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,375
A Lamda Driver?
What on Earth is that?

55
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,958
[AL A.I.]
I don't know. Continue--

56
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,791
Give me an answer, Al!

57
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,375
[AL A.I.]
I don't know.

58
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,750
[KURZ]
What the heck is goin' on?

59
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,625
My mecha got completely
shattered by that guy!

60
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,916
[KANAME]
Somehow I... I understand.

61
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,041
[KURZ]
Kaname? Are you okay? Hey!

62
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,291
I'm not feeling too well.

63
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,458
He doesn't know how
to use it consciously,

64
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,958
it was just a strong defensive
impulse on his part...

65
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:46,541
Stop! Pull yourself
together, Kaname!

66
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,000
[KANAME]
A clue... I'll give him a--

67
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,833
[KURZ]
A clue? What kind of a clue?

68
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,625
[KANAME] I'm the one
who's always being saved...

69
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,125
This time I'm doing the saving.

70
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,666
Artificial contrast
interference...

71
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,291
[KANAME screams]

72
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,041
No!

73
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:06,958
Kaname!

74
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,166
[KANAME grunts]

75
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,166
I'm... not gonna... do it!

76
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,208
[KANAME grunts]

77
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,791
[KURZ]
Are you... okay?

78
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:20,500
I need you to give me...
your radio.

79
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,666
[KURZ]
Huh?

80
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,041
C'mon, I need to let
him know! Hurry up!

81
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,708
[GAURON laughs]

82
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:30,083
[GAURON] Very good.
But can you do it again?

83
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,875
[KANAME]
Sousuke, can you hear me?

84
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,083
Is that Chidori?!

85
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,291
Listen up! Your enemy
has loaded his mecha

86
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,666
with special and
dangerous equipment!

87
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,000
It's a... It's a machine that
has the ability to transform

88
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,916
the pilot's aggressive impulses
into actual, physical power!

89
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,541
Uh, but, Ch-Chidori...

90
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,125
[KANAME]
Listen to me!

91
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:56,125
I... I don't exactly know the
reason, but your AS also has it!

92
00:07:56,208 --> 00:08:00,041
The Lamda Driver! That's why
you were safe from his attack!

93
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,208
What is the Lamda Driver?

94
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,583
You were thinking about
protecting your body,

95
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:05,750
isn't that right?

96
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,333
The device simply
reacted to your mind.

97
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:12,041
The images in your mind
take real, physical shape!

98
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,916
Images taking real, physical
shape? But that's impossible!

99
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,083
[SOUSKE gasps]

100
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,666
[GAURON gasps]

101
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,791
What is this thing?

102
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,208
The enemy tried to use his power
to smash you into pieces.

103
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,041
But you didn't let him do it.

104
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,333
You can also amplify
your counter attack

105
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,500
and all you have to do

106
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,458
is focus your hope
to beat your opponent!

107
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,750
Put your whole spirit in!

108
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,041
For one single moment!

109
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,375
[GAURON laughs]

110
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,500
Now it all makes sense, Kashim!

111
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,416
Your people have been
protecting the Whispered!

112
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,583
No wonder you have one of these!

113
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,375
[KANAME] What are you doing?!
Use your spirit!

114
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,750
I'm trying, but I can't get
a power field to materialize!

115
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:12,791
Like this?!

116
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,500
[GAURON grunts]

117
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:26,291
Just how long do you plan
to keep up this little dance?

118
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,333
Huh?

119
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,625
[GARUON] There's not much point;
I get the impression

120
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,125
you don't know how
to use that device.

121
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,583
[SOUSKE growls]

122
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,333
[GAURON]
It's time we put an end to this.

123
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,708
[KANAME] Sousuke, you have to
remember to concentrate, okay?

124
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,041
Take a deep breath.

125
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,708
When you exhale, put your
spirit into the shell.

126
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,250
That's what you say...

127
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,833
[KANAME]
Then think of this!

128
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:52,416
If you lose, the bad guys are
gonna rip off all my clothes,

129
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,583
play around with my body,
and kill me when they're done!

130
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,958
Imagine that happening to me!

131
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,166
[KANAME]
You hate it, right?

132
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,666
[SOUSUKE]
Right.

133
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,416
[KANAME]
Does it make you mad?

134
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,208
[SOUSUKE]
I guess so.

135
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:11,291
[KANAME] He's trying to
do these things to me.

136
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,375
You can't let him
do that, can you?

137
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,750
[SOUSUKE]
No!

138
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:19,291
[KANAME]
Then point the gun at him!

139
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,875
Well, well, desperate, are we?

140
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,375
I'm so disappointed.

141
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,000
You'll be fine.
Close your eyes, Sousuke.

142
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:32,708
Trust me.
Imagine it in your mind.

143
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,833
In a few seconds,
you will strike.

144
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,208
Don't tell him to close his eyes
in front of the enemy--!

145
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,750
Now you should
take a deep breath...

146
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,333
[GAURON]
Have fun in hell!

147
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,625
[KANAME]
...hold the image...

148
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,166
...and now!

149
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,416
...And now!

150
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,625
[SOUSUKE grunts]

151
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,583
[KANAME]
Sousuke, are you all right?

152
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,791
[SOUSUKE]
Affirmative.

153
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,333
Do you think we could
have a more suitable vehicle

154
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,833
for transporting the injured?

155
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,791
[SOUSUKE] Stop complaining
about everything!

156
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,625
How are you feeling, Chidori?

157
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,208
Great! Much better, thanks!

158
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,083
But I'm not really sure what
I was talking about back there.

159
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,166
Huh?

160
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,166

Are you okay there, Chidori?

165
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,000
Wait 'til she wakes up.

166
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,000

167

[KURZ]
Look, Kaname, the ocean!

168
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,833
[KANAME gasps]

169
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,458
[KURZ] As well as a whole
bunch of those savages

170
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,375
to see us off...

171
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,875
[MAI]
Urzu 7, run straight ahead.

172
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,291
Sousuke! You've only
got one chance!

173
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,583
You gotta jump, there,
from the tip of the cape!

174
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,791
[MELISSA] Retrieved Urzu 7.
Placing it in hatch number 4.

175
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,791
Urzu 7 in place.

176
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:52,250
[OPERATOR] Closing hatch
number 4. Two more seconds.

177
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,500
Hatch 4 closed.

178
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,791
Hard to starboard,
full-speed bearing 2-0-5.

179
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,500
Aye, aye, ma'am.

180
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:03,458
Hard to starboard! Set a course
for 2-0-5, maximum speed!

181
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,208
[KALININ]
Took a bit of a beating, I see.

182
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,625
What happened to Gauron?

183
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,416
[SOUSUKE] He died.
There's no mistake this time.

184
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,041
[KALININ] Is that right?
I wish I'd been able to be there

185
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,875
to witness it with my own eyes.

186
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,125
Is there something
you wanted to tell me?

187
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:40,666
Uh, yes, sir.
The Lamda Driver... what is it?

188
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,583
I'm well versed in my basic
physics, Lt. Commander,

189
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,708
but I've never heard of a
device that could generate

190
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,541
so much power.

191
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:52,250
[KALININ] Your generation may
find this hard to believe,

192
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:56,541
but current weapons technology
isn't at all normal.

193
00:14:56,625 --> 00:15:02,083
That Lamda Driver, the ECS, the
submarine's propulsion system.

194
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,458
All of them are over-developed.

195
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,000
Have you ever thought
how unnatural it is

196
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,416
for robots ripped from the
pages of science fiction

197
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,083
to be so widely used
on the battlefield?

198
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:16,125
Well, today...
was the first time I did.

199
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,875
[KALININ] That question has
bothered me for a long time.

200
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,833
I thought these things couldn't
exist, but they are real.

201
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:26,041
Modern weapons like the AS are
supported by a system known as

202
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,375
Black Technology.

203
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:32,666
Who invented it, or better yet,
where did it come from?

204
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,583
Do you understand me, Sgt.?

205
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,458
Are you talking about someone
like Miss Kaname Chidori, sir?

206
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,791
These so-called Whispered?

207
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,041
I couldn't say
a word either way,

208
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:44,208
but you should
keep it in your mind.

209
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,458
Sir...

210
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,916
And while we're on
the topic of Miss Chidori,

211
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,250
our Information Bureau is
circulating a false report.

212
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,000
It states that Guaron's group
studied Kaname Chidori

213
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:57,916
and discovered she wasn't
one of the Whispered after all.

214
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
She should be safe for a while.

215
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,750
But even with those measures,
we still need some insurance.

216
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,625
Insurance?

217
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,083
Have you woken up?

218
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,458
[KANAME]
Uh...

219
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:20,833
Sousuke is safe.
You needn't worry about him.

220
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,500
[KANAME]
Where am I, and who are you?

221
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,208
[MELISSA]
You're in a hospital in Tokyo

222
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,541
where you've been sleeping

223
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,791
for the past 2 days.
Your strength has improved.

224
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,875
As for me, I'm one of
Sousuke's fellow soldiers.

225
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,541
You're Sousuke's friend?

226
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,041
[MELISSA] I don't have
much time, so I'll be brief.

227
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,375
Listen, Kaname. At the base,
they gave you a shot

228
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,916
of some drug which made
you lose consciousness,

229
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,416
and the next thing you knew,
you were in the hospital.

230
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,958
And you don't remember anything

231
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:49,916
that happened between then,
okay? Please forget everything.

232
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,500
Wait a minute.
So who are you people?

233
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:56,083
[MELISSA] We're Mithril. We wipe
out terrorist organizations

234
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,166
and destroy drug factories.

235
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,708
An army of justice
protecting the world.

236
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,625
Something along those lines.

237
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:03,916
[KANAME]
Mithril...

238
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,583
[MELISSA] There should be
some people in Japan

239
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,500
who have heard the name.

240
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,958
But if you don't want
any trouble, and this is key,

241
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,416
you should insist that
you don't remember anything.

242
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,041
[MELISSA] And... I really
need to thank you.

243
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,333
What do you mean?

244
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,291
For helping two of my men
return home safely.

245
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,708
You saved their lives.

246
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,041
I... I didn't really
do anything...

247
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,791
If you hadn't been there,
Sousuke and Kurtz wouldn't have

248
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,000
made it out alive.

249
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,875
I mean, maybe we have
our roles mixed up,

250
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,416
because it seems that
out of all of us,

251
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,208
you might be the strongest.

252
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:39,416
Oh, stop it.
Now I'm embarrassed.

[KANAME giggles]

00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,375
Well, I better go.

How is Sousuke?

00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,333
[MELISSA] Sousuke? He's been
assigned to another mission.

259
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,458
Did he... leave a message?

260
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,416
You mean to you? Um...

261
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,625
Not that I'm aware of.

They sort of just tossed us off
the plane at Fukuoka airport.

After that, the rescuers took
off and no one's seen 'em since.

They really didn't seem to
be related to the UN at all.

were staying here as a patient.

How are we supposed
to use them now, dummy?!

318
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,791
[SOUSUKE] We might be
able to dry them out.

319
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:06,708
[KANAME growls]

320
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,541
[KANAME]
Don't give me excuses!

321
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,208
You must've left your
brain in Siberia!

322
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,875
I don't care if you are
a skilled AS pilot,

323
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:14,708
when I tell you to...

324
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:19,375
[incoherent yelling]

325
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,208
[KANAME]
Sousuke got asked out on a date?

326
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:03,208
Well, it's none of my business.

327
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:05,791
He should be able
to go where he wants.

328
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:09,916
Next Full Metal Panic,
episode 8: "Part Time Steady."

329
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,833
[KANAME gasps]

330
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:11,791
[KANAME]
He's gonna kiss her?!

331
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:12,750
[SOUSUKE]
It's not a problem.

332
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:15,208
[KANAME]
Oh, yes it is!
