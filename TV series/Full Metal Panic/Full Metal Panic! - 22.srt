1
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,416
[DANA A.I.]
Welcome Captain Gauron.

2
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,250
Please give me your order.

3
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,916
[GAURON] Thank you, Dana,
don't mind if I do.

4
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,500
How about we start with
an evacuation drill?

5
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,833
Sound the alarm for a fire
at a reactor accident.

6
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,250
Gather everyone in the hangar.

7
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,833
[DANA A.I.]
Aye, sir.

8
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,541
[CAPTAIN SAILOR]
You hear an alarm?

9
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:29,916
[OFFICER] Yes. Bearing is 1-5-8,
just  under the thermal layer.

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,666
Lemme hear.

11
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,250
Huh?

12
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,041
[OFFICER] I can't detect
any propulsion signature,

13
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,666
but it's moving.

14
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,208
And it's going at a
pretty good clip, too.

15
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:45,541
No sound of the engine screw,
and a very high speed.

16
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,500
[TAKENAKA]
It's that Toy Box.

17
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:52,333
Huh? Oh, it's "Toy Box", is
it? How can you be so dam--

18
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,666
What?

19
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,125
Nevermind.

20
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:59,250
Anyway, this means it's finally
showing its true colors.

21
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:04,125
All right! We're gonna
ambush Toy Box.

22
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:08,250
Forward one-third power.
Surfacing to depth 180.

23
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,541
Aye, sir.

24
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:13,500
Forward one-third power.
Surface to depth 180.

25
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:29,041
[alarm blaring]

26
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,458
What d'ya think?

27
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:36,541
Not enough information to
make an assessment just yet.

28
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,000
You think it's Gauron?

29
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,875
[alarm continues]

30
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,083
I need to get some weapons.

31
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,083
[PERSONNEL 1] Did you hear
anything about a drill?

32
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:49,250
[PERSONNEL 2]
No. Any idea what's going on?

33
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:53,041
Don't you think... this is
just a little strange?

34
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,291
[GAURON] The front half of this
submarine houses the hangar

35
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:03,125
where they are: the torpedoes,
the missile launching system,

36
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,708
and the weapons
and ammunition room.

37
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:10,083
On the other hand, the rear
half has the engine room,

38
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:15,000
the reactor, living
quarters, the cafeteria,

39
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:18,791
and this central command center.

40
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:22,541
My little digital sweetheart,
Miss Dana, has locked all

41
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,958
the bulkheads in the
middle at my command.

42
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:28,375
Opening the bulkheads from
the hangar side is gonna be,

43
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,666
well, impossible.

44
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,750
Which means we won't be getting
any visits from a rescue party.

45
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,291
Good plan, huh?

46
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,875
I have to disagree.

47
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,333
All of the AS's are
stored in the hangar.

48
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,958
I'm sure they could
simply make a hole

49
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,208
with a monomolecular cutter.

50
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,750
Yes, that's why
I'm considering this.

51
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:48,791
[snaps]

52
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,000
Miss Dana.

53
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,666
[DANA A.I.]
Yes, Captain?

54
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,458
I want you to adjust
the air supply setting

55
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:59,125
in the front half...
Maximum oxygen concentration.

56
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,000
Wait, if you do that--

57
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:04,500
It just takes one
spark, and Boom.

58
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,166
Of course, you could imagine,

59
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,750
critical thinking
is not a priority

60
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:12,708
when you're high on oxygen.
The physics may escape them.

61
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,958
Call it off.

62
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,958
Don't give me orders.

63
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's not forget who's
captain on this boat.

64
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:26,083
[laughs]

65
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,541
It's top brass
from the Pentagon;

66
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,250
some group I've never heard of.

67
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,958
I sure do wonder what they're
gonna be talking about.

68
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,958
[BUNKER HILL CAPTAIN]
Leave them alone.

69
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,583
We're just letting
them use our space.

70
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,333
And I have no desire
to get involved.

71
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:52,000
Captain, sir. We were able to
capture our nuclear submarine.

72
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:56,375
We've got it at a bearing
of 2-3-0, distance 500.

73
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,166
It's the Pasadena, sir.

74
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,416
Pasadena? Sailor's boat.

75
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,250
Can't stand that guy.
Leave him alone.

76
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,166
Is that all you're gonna say?

77
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,458
[BUNKER HILL CAPTAIN] That's the
trick to retiring in the Navy

78
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,583
without any trouble.

79
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,750
We'll reach the point
in 20 minutes, sir.

80
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,708
[CAPTAIN SAILOR]
Now we're gettin' somewhere!

81
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:17,958
Start the masker!

82
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,708
[TAKANAKA]
Aye, sir. Start masker!

83
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,291
[murmuring]

84
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,625
[sighs]

85
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,291
What's the matter?

86
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,458
Nothing. Just getting old.

87
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,125
No, you're not.

88
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,458
[SAILOR 1]
Y-You feel that?

89
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,875
[SAILOR 2] Yeah... my ears...
They're ringing...

90
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,791
[murmuring continues]

91
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:46,708
[gasps]

92
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,416
Commander!

93
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,875
The room's oxygen
content is shooting up!

94
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,750
I can't open the doors!

95
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,416
What could be wrong?

96
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,041
Contact the command center!

97
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,708
We can't!

98
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,125
All the communications on
the submarine are blacked out.

99
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,791
Oh, no...

100
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:11,000
[TELETHA] I need to do
something... But what?

101
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,166
[TELETHA] 
Miss Kaname.

102
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,541
Please listen carefully to
what I'm going to tell you.

103
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,916
[KANAME]
Resonance...

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,791
[TELETHA] Dana recognizes
Gauron as Captain.

105
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:29,625
We can't cancel the registration
through the usual procedures.

106
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:33,708
Because of this, we must take
control of Dana directly.

107
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,666
[gasps]

108
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,333
[yawns]

109
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,000
[TELETHA]
It's a key to my safe.

110
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,208
In there, you'll
find another key.

111
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,333
[gasps]

112
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,500
[TELETHA]
The universal key.

113
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,750
[KANAME] 
Universal key?

114
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:00,000
[TELETHA] After that, look in
the central computer room

115
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:04,291
on the third deck for Lady
Chapel, the heart of Dana.

116
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,000
[TELETHA]
Once you're in,

117
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:13,416
I want you to resonate
with me one more time.

118
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,250
Wait a minute, Lady Chapel,
what is that?

119
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:21,500
[TELETHA] I'm a terrible
athlete. You're the only one.

120
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:22,666
But it'll be...

121
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,500
Impossi-- [gasps]

122
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,291
[GAURON]
Hmm?

123
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:34,791
It bothers me... when people
shout for no reason.

124
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,041
Hmm?

125
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:43,041
So... What is it you're hiding
there behind your back?

126
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,583
Show and tell.

127
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,791
[KANAME]
Help me.

128
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,583
Miss Kaname, go!

129
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:52,958
Huh?

130
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:53,916
[yells]

131

[gasps]

133
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,291
Run for it!

134
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,250
[GUEN]
Huh?

135
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,750
Hold it!

136
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,166
Ah!

137
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,916
Stop right there!

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,750
[screams]

139
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:11,666
What the...?

140
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,416
You little shit! I'll kill you!

141
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,583
Did you hear that?

142
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,958
Gunshots, wasn't it?

143
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,291
[SOUSUKE]
It came from the command center.

144
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,875
[clicking]

145
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,541
[gasps]

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,708
Very well played, little miss.

147
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,208
[TELETHA]
Ah!

148
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,625
[KALININ] Here are all
the items to confirm.

149
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:47,375
By the way, what seas is
Toy Box currently patrolling?

150
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,458
I don't understand the
meaning of your question.

151
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,375
Don't insult my intelligence.

152
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,958
We know you have
in your possession

153
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,750
a submarine with
frightening potential.

154
00:09:56,833 --> 00:10:00,916
I'm sorry, but my superiors
do not keep me informed

155
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,416
with details on these matters.

156
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:11,250
Oh well. But I'd like to
advise you, Lt. Commander...

157
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,416
...to remember who the
police of the world are.

158
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,375
There are some who'd say
the theory of globalism

159
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:22,041
is nothing more than
words on paper.

160
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,833
If your homeland
collapses, my friend,

161
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:29,916
that theory suddenly starts

00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:42,333
So please, don't tell me you'll
be all right on your own.

325
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,750
Okay, we'll stick
together for now.

326
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,083
[sniffs]

327
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,375
[gasps]

328
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,500
Sousuke, you've been injured!

329
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,083
I'm okay, it's not
a problem for me.

330
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,375
Are you sure?

331
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,000
Yes, I'm sure.

332
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,000
[SOUSUKE]
Can you stand?

333
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,083
[mechanical howling]

334
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,166
[gasps]

335
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,125
Sounds like an attacker's sonar!

336
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,666
Huh?

337
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,666
[KANAME] I won't let him
do whatever he wants.

338
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,125
The nuclear reactor is my heart.

339
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:07,333
The two pairs of
hydroplanes are my wings.

340
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:09,750
Next Full Metal Panic,
Episode 23:

341
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,708
"Field of Giants."

342
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,708
Sousuke, the rest is up to you!
