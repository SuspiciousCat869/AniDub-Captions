the bad guys are gonna
rip off all my clothes,

and kill me when they're done.

[SOUSUKE]
I guess so.

10
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,583
[KANAME] He's trying to
do these things to me.

11
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,541
You can't let him
do that, can you?

No, I can't.

Are you here alone?

16
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,500
Yes, I am, unfortunately.

17
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,416
Then how 'bout you and me
go watch the sea lice

Oh, I'm sorry it couldn't
be Sousuke this time,

20
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,916
but he's out on a business trip.

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,083
Whatever.

22
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,000

00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,208
Mr. Sagara. Thank you
so much for coming.

27
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,208
This gentleman is
from intelligence.

28
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:19,166
Sergeant Sagara.
Look behind you.

29
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,125
The Intelligence Department
took these photos

30
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,750
of Helmajistani
weapons merchants

31
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,833
the day before yesterday.

00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,458
[INTELLIGENCE OFFICER]
What do ya think?

33
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,541
See any familiar faces?

00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,541
[gasps]

35
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,875
It would seem that you have some

36
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,208
incredibly lucky
friends, Sergeant.

37
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,750
[INTELLIGENCE OFFICER]
I'll make this breif.

38
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,583
Soon, one of our units
in the Indian Ocean

39
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,458
will be carrying out an
assassination mission

40
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,708
on this man.

41
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,750
[gasps]

42
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:50,958
Futhermore, we have decided that

43
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,875
you will be joining this
unit in the mission.

44
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,375
There are three
reasons for this.

45
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,125
Number one: you have
already engaged

46
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,875
this target on the battlefield.

47
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,833
Number two: we believe it is
necessary to utilize Arbalest

48
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,416
in order to successfully
eliminate the target.

49
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,458
Number three: you know the area
around Helmajistan very well.

50
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,375
Your participation in
this mission is mandatory.

51
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,958
No objections allowed.

52
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:14,500
So, Captain Testarossa,
we're borrowing your sergeant.

53
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:21,500
[KALININ]
I see. So he survived as well.

54
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,750
[TELETHA]
I'm truly sorry, Mr. Sagara.

55
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:28,083
I know that this isn't the
Tuahar de Danaan's mission.

56
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,625
I objected to the idea but...

57
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:35,583
[SOUSUKE] No, ma'am. I would do
this even if I had to volunteer.

58
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:39,791
Well then, I guess you'll
be on your way to Helmajistan.

59
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:40,875
[SOUSUKE]
Yes.

60
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,416
Don't get too hot
under the collar.

61
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,625
Please, Captain, you don't
need to be worried.

62
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,750
Helmajistan is Sergeant
Sagara's home ground.

63
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:57,208
But I... I can't
shake this feeling.

64
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:00,250
I'm afraid something
terrible may happen.

65
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,625
[JACKSON] I shit you not.
Last fight I saw,

66
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,625
that damn Herculus was knocked
out cold in 30 seconds.

67
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,333
It was obviously a fixed game.

68
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,625
I was so freakin' pissed,
I punched a bookie.

69
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,708
Strangely enough,
my 100 dollars

70
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,208
turned into 1,000.

71
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,916
Must've been my luck day.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,250
But you know what they say,

73
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,041
Brooklyn's a better
investment than Wall Street.

74
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,083
[BATIST] Maybe, but the
problem with riding bubbles

75
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,375
like that is they tend to burst.

76
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,666
[GRAY] Please, Jackson.
We all know you like to chat,

77
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,500
but try to think
about your duty.

78
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,041
Huh? Exactly what do you
want me to think about?

79
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,291
I say we're lucky to have
such an easy mission.

80
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,041
It don't sit too well with me.

81
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,625
How come so many
of us have to come

82
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,958
all this way to
Helmajistan of all places?

83
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,291
Just so we can say we
knocked off one terrorist?

84
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,958
Because he's an
extremely dangerous enemy.

85
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,833
I've heard he uses some kind of
special experimental weapon.

86
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,250
Isn't that right, Bill?

87

Oh, yes. Sgt. Sagara is joining
our mission from de Danaan.

That's you, right?

Come on now.

If it worked for
the Seattle Mariners,

96
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,541
then who the hell
are we to judge?

Ha! Never thought they'd start
givin' rank to little kids.

Hey, kid.

like chocolate, huh?

You want some candy?

Cut it out!

Give it a rest, Jackson.

I'm just kiddin' man. Chill out.

me be pals, okay?

How 'bout it, Tom Sawyer?

I'm sorry that our friend
was acting so rude.

It doesn't matter.

Sergeant Sousuke Sagara, ma'am.

112
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,958
I heard that you know
Helmajistan inside and out.

113
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,708
We'll be counting
on your expertise.

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,333
Now listen up, you little shit.

115
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,708
This is our mission.

116
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,250
We have no intention of
asking you for your advice.

117
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,708
You remember that.

118
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,666
Man, couldn't the transport
have dropped us off

119
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,708
a little closer to the enemy?

120
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,000
Because they often have
sandstorms around here,

121
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,583
we can't make very
good use of the ETS.

122
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,458
It's a very sensitive system.

123
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,000
Ah, it's a useless system,

124
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,291
Camoflauge clothes would
probably be better.

125
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,666
So we get to walk, eh?

126
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,750

picnic for us old farts.

The enemy should be reaching
this valley in four hours.

143

It should take their

amount of time to go
accross the whole valley.

The area between points
zero four and zero seven

provide sutible terrain to

While they're going
through this area,

we'll separate into two groups

our only choice is to attack him

away from his AS.

Can I use it?

327
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,250
So, can you use it?

328
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,458
[SOUSUKE]
Yes, I will use it!

[GAURON]
They stole the merchandise!

333
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:37,333
Connect me to
Helmajistani military HQ!

334
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,958
Move it, you worthless
sack of shit!

335
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:43,333
Ow! Dammit, you idiot!

Double time, people!

341
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,875
We have to take this as far
away as we possibly can!

342
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:04,000
Dammit... Bill was... He was...

While the enemies close in
on us, we make a pilgramage

348
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,125
in the hopeless wilderness.
