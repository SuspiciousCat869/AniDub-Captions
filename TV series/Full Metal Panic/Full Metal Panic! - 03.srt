I'm back!

162
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,791
Well, I see you're awake,
Sgt. Serious.

163
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,416
On duty and drunk, huh?

164
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,041
Nothing I could do about it.

165
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,625
I was just gonna have one beer,
and that's it, man.

166
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,916
But that Kyoko kept pouring
me more and more!

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,833
Wait, Kyoko?! Kyoko Tokiwa?!
You mean Kaname's friend?!

168
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,000
But she--

169
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,750
Hey! You're awake too,
aren't you, Miss?

170
00:09:56,833 --> 00:10:01,375
You know, staying up too late
is murder on your skin.

171
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,791
[MELISSA]
That's sick.

172
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,916
I can't believe you picked up
the mission objective...

173
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,833
I oughta pop one in your
ass right now, Sgt. Weber.

174
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,083
And I would get off
pretty easy, too.

175
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:19,750
My ass? Sounds like...
sexual harassment.

176
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,208
This is a secret mission.

177
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,125
Why are you trying
to blow our cover?!

178
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:26,541
What're ya, stupid? If I make
friendly with the girls,

179
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,500
it'll be much easier
to keep my eye on 'em.

180
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,916
Getting attached could
jeopardize the mission.

181
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,666
You might lose the ability
to make judgments

182
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,875
with a clear head.

183
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,958
Y'know what Kaname
said about you?

184
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:40,125
"Oh, this interesting guy just
transferred to our school!"

185
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,833
Among other things...

186
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,083
What else did she say?

187
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,166
You wanna know...?

188
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,250
Not really...

189
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,000
No, it's my duty.
Better tell me.

190
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,791
Lemme hear you say
"Please, Sgt. Weber."

[SOUSUKE growls]

I'm just kidding, no need
to get all bent out of shape.

00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,333
[MELISSA]
Sousuke, Kurz! Big problem!

195
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,125
[MELISSA] 20:21 hours.
Suspicious person on balcony.

197
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,583
Is the suspect working alone?

198
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,541
I dunno. His friends
could be hiding.

199
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,416
Either way, we need
to catch that guy.

200
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,125
Urzu 6, get on top of the
building across the street.

201
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,416
Urzu 7, go intercept the target.

202
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,166
Give me 120 seconds!

203
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,666
[MELISSA]
I'll be waiting in the M9.

204
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,291
[KURZ] Urzu 6 to everyone.
I'm ready and waiting.

205
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,166
I'm not picking up any
signs of an accomplice.

206
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,666
My guess is the suspect
is all by himself.

207
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,166
[SOUSUKE] Don't let your guard
down, especially behind you.

208
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,541
You forget who
you're talkin' to.

209
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,208
Urzu 7. According to the
directional microphone,

210
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,250
it seems Miss Chidori's in
the bathroom taking a shower.

211
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,291
[MELISSA] Get rid of him before
she exits the bathroom,

212
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,000
but don't kill him.

Urzu 7, roger.

Don't say anything. Understand?

00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,958
Mm-hm!

00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:36,041
Well chosen. Life is
too short to be stupid.

00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,375
Huh...?

221
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:55,958
[KURZ] Urzu 6 to Urzu 7. Take a
good look at what's in his hand.

222
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:04,583
[KURZ] Panties.
Beautiful, pure white panties.

223
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,166
Urzu 6, over and out.

224
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,666
[MELISSA] We're going back.
You should do the same.

225
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,833
God, I don't get paid enough
to put up with this...

226
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,666
You may speak now.

227
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,916
I'm so s-s-s-sorry!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

228
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,541
I meant quietly.

229
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,250
I'm sorry!
Please don't arrest me.

230
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,125
Don't worry, I'm not
with the police.

231
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,333
But I am going to need
an explanation from you.

232
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:37,750
Th-Thank you, sir.
H-Hey, is that you, Sousuke?

233
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,500
You must be confused.

234
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,291
Huh...? But you look like--

235
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,291
[SOUSUKE]
Sorry, wrong person.

236
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,875
You're Shinji Kazuma, right?

237
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,625
Now tell me what
you're doing here!

238
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,500
As you can see, I'm a panty
thief. Are you one too?

239
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,333
No way! I merely happened
to be passing by.

240
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,500
O... kay...

241
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,875
And what were you going to do

242
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,750
once you'd stolen
her undergarments?

243
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,166
[SHINJI]
I'm not the one who wants them!

244
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,791
It was... the older
students who made me.

245
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,333
What... older students?

246
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,000
Older students in photo club.

247
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,208
The students one year above me

248
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,666
took a bunch of
my photo negatives

249
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,166
that I've been saving for
a really, really long time.

250
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,250
They... They told me I had
to steal Kaname's panties

251
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,791
if I wanted to get my
photo negatives back.

252
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,375
[SOUSUKE]
So they're blackmailing you.

253
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,875
[SHINJI] It's because my
negatives are all wide shots.

254
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,125
"You're not brave enough to
get close to your subject.

255
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,458
This is training for you
to be a real photographer."

256
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,666
That's how they put it.

257
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,208
That's bullshit.

258
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:30,208
[SHINJI] They said, "Kaname
Chidori is like a big celebrity

259
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,916
nobody wants for a girlfriend,

260
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,500
so it's safe to test
your courage on her."

261
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,500
This story is starting
to fall into place...

262
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,041
Don't you think it would
bother her though?

263
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,333
But I really wanted to
get my negatives back.

264
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,875
It's a collection of photos
I took of the Arm Slaves

265
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,583
on all the bases I've visited.

266
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,125
Really?

267
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,375
You eat, sleep, and breathe
this military stuff, don't you?

268
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,583
No, I don't think I'd
put it quite like that.

269
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,333
Did you know that I got photos
of the US Marine Corps' M6

270
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,625
stationed in Okinawa?

271
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,791
No way! You don't
mean the A2 model?

272
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:03,541
Uh-huh! And get this: It even
had a reactive armor shield!

273
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,000
[SOUSUKE]
So how is the movement on it?

274
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,500
[SHINJI] According to
the people on the base,

275
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,458
its balance isn't the greatest.

276
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,708
If I remember correctly,

277
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:13,250
the control system is
Rockwell's MS012, right?

278
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,375
[KURZ laughs]

279
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,291
[SOUSUKE]
No, I think it's 11.

280
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,208
[SHINJI]
Is it? Well, in any case,

281
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:23,166
the feedback architecture
is way too sensitive.

282
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,833
Once the bi-lateral angle
exceeds 3.5, its hard to control

283
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,125
because of the weight
of the portable firearms.

284
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,166
[SOUSUKE]
I see... You may be right.

285
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,833
Would you say, then, that it's
best suited for ambush tactics?

286
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,083
[SHINJI] Yeah, and it's
gonna be a long time...

287
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,541
They're having a nice chat.

Could this be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship?

you know about the military.

you're only a civilian.

Well, thanks, Sousuke,
but I'm not that good.

You know a whole lot more
about the military than I do.

a little bit...

00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,833
[MAN]
You know what that sound is?

316
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,375
No.

317
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:13,375
[MAN] It's a DVD. I'm looking
at my screen right now,

318
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,166
and I'm seeing some
interesting numbers.

319
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:20,708
Is it the research data?!
Damn you, when did you get it?!

320
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:21,958
[MAN]
Since I thought your temper

321
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,291
might get the better of you,

322
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:27,291
I took so me extra measures.
Do svidánija, Chief.

323
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,000
Take care of yourself in prison.

324
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,583
Wait! What do you plan on
doing with this data?!

325
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,000
[crashing]

326
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,333
[OFFICER]
Chief, the party headquarters

327
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:39,583
has taken a special interest
in your "side job".

328
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:40,583
[KGB CHIEF]
What?!

329
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:41,625
[OFFICER]
They suspected that

330
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,958
you misused
government facilities

331
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,333
and brought on a
catastrophic loss.

332
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,166
[KGB CHIEF] Wait, you don't
understand! I'm being framed!

333
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,708
[OFFICER] Save it! You can tell
us the whole story in Lubianka.

334
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,500
[cell phone beeps]

335
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,333
[MAN chuckles]

336
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:58,958
[KURZ]
Like a big celebrity

337
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,666
that nobody wants for
a girlfriend, huh?

338
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,500
Yeah, I could see that.

339
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,583
Chidori certainly knows
how to throw a punch.

340
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:08,208
I tried to let Kazuma run away,
but he fell off the balcony

341
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,916
and got tangled in
the hedges below.

342
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,083
I'm surprised he didn't die,
falling from the fourth floor.

343
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,625
It was a close call for me, too.

344
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,083
I finally managed to escape,

345
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,791
but if I had been killed
by the mission objective,

346
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,625
I have to wonder how the
Lt. Commander would've reacted.

347
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,833
Oh, I can imagine how
it would play out:

348
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,875
Please sign here for
the Sergeant's things...

349
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,458
And now we will move on to
the next order of business.

350
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,666
Come on, Sousuke. Can't I even
get a little chuckle outta ya?

351
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,833
I suppose if Miss Chidori
didn't hate me before,

352
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,916
she certainly must by now.

353
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,666
I suppose you're right.

354
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,000
[SOUSUKE]
Huh?

355
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,833
It appears to be an
order from Dadanaan.

356
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,375
Our work is finished.

357
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:49,375
Your tour of duty as Kaname
Chidori's bodyguards... is over.

358
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,500
Uh-- huh?

359
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,916
I don't understand.

360
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,916
It says here that they
were able to destroy

361
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,458
the enemy's main facility.

362
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,458
So it's become safe, for now.

363
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,541
And we won't be needing to tag
along with Miss Chidori anymore.

364
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,416
Aw, man. Happens all the time.

365
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,708
You get to know somebody,
and then they're gone.

366
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:08,041
It was such a
short-lived romance.

367
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,083
Wait, it also says we get
a week off here in Tokyo!

368
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,083
You're kidding! That rocks!

369
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,666
[MELISSA] However, Urzu 7 is
to attend the school trip,

370
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,958
as was previously planned.

371
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:17,833
I'm what?

372
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,333
The fee has been paid in full,

373
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,458
and Sgt. Sagara needs
to make the most of it.

374
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,208
By the Lt. Commander's order.

375
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,250
But I can't!

376
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,333
Oh, come on! Have some fun!

377
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,125
Look, Sousuke, now that Kaname's
safe, why don't you enjoy

378
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,041
the life of an ordinary
high school student

379
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,083
while you still can. Hm?

380
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,666
Very well, then. It'll be a
valuable learning experience.

381
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,000
[KANAME] Second years,
class four. Enter the terminal.

382
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,958
Come on, people!
Let's get a move on!

383
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,041
Kaname, I have a
question to ask you.

384
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:01,375
Get in line and stop
walking so slowly!

385
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,166
Should I go around and
collect everyone's garbage

386
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,000
on the aircraft before we land,
or do you think I should wait

387
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,333
until everyone is
disembarked from the aircraft?

388
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:12,458
I'm very busy right now! Could
you please not talk to me?!

389
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,500
[CLASS murmurs]

390
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,708
Well, I guess it's only natural.

391
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,000
If you found two guys chatting
while playing with your panties,

392
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,000
you'd be pretty angry, too!

393
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,541
Huh?

394
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,958
Hey, what's wrong?
You look, like, super angry!

395
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,208
No, this is me. The usual me.

396
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:41,000
[chattering]

397
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,125
[MAN]
Hard work, isn't it?

398
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,208
Having to serve so many
high school students

399
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,958
at the same time.
Must be at your wits end.

400
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,208
No, I've done it before.

401
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,458
I'd like to get
8,000 meters in the air

402
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,833
and pitch them out
the emergency door.

403
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,500
I imagine we'd all enjoy a nice,

404
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:01,500
quiet, relaxing flight from
there on out, don't you think?

405
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:02,750
[STEWARDESS chuckles]

407
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,208
I'm only kidding.

408
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,458
Is this your first
time on a plane?

409
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:12,958
[KYOKO]
Yeah.

410
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,500
[KANAME] We've been waiting
for this school trip

411
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,000
for a long time.

412
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,583
Wait, what's wrong
with this plane?

413
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,208
Aren't we going to Okinawa?

414
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:07,541
What? What?! I'm a hostage?!

415
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:10,958
Next Full Metal Panic,
Episode 4: "Kidnap."

416
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,666
This is your chance, Sousuke!

417
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,583
[SOUSUKE]
Leave the garbage to me.
