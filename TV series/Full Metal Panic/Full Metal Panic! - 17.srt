[GRAY] What if he's alive?
What if he's still fighting?

00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,208
Withdrawing would mean
abandoning him.

I could never do something
like that to him.

00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,083
[SOUSUKE laughing]
Oh yeah?

161
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,458
--[ZAIED] Oh, ya got me!
--You missed!

162
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,041
[ZAIED] Well it's a good
thing you're not against me

163
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,791
in a real battle. Otherwise
I'd take you down right now!

164
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,041
[ZAIED]
Forgive me, Kashim.

165
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,583
I wanted to be on
the winning team.

166
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,375
[ZAIED]
You haven't changed.

167
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,791
Your attacks are as
effective as ever.

168
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,208
[ARBALEST A.I.]
Communications system restored.

169
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,791
Then connect me.

170
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,416
[GRAY]
Batist, what are you doing?!

171
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,166
[BATIST]
I'm going to kill that Gauron.

172
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,708
[GRAY] You're injured!
What are you talking about?

173
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,208
[BATIST]
Do you wanna know why

174
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,958
God deals us such
a terrible card?

175
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,625
It's simply because...

176
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,333
...he went to all this trouble
to create these idiots

177
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:07,708
called humans, and he's
regretted it ever since.

178
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,583
Listen, Gray.

179
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,166
If you survive,
please tell Sagara...

180
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,166
that he'll make a good
soldier when he grows up.

181
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,125
[GRAY]
Batist!

182
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,208
[BATIST]
SDM, stand by!

183
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,250
[AI] Warning, once the
self-destruct mode has been set,

184
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,875
it cannot be cancelled.
Do you accept?

185
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,000
I accept! Start the sequence!

186
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,541
[AI] This is the final
confirmation. Do you accept?

187
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,458
Yes I accept. Hurry it up!

188
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,666
[AI] Roger. Please set a time to
schedule the execution.

189
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,083
In ten seconds.

190
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,208
[AI]
Roger. Ten seconds starting now.

191
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,166
ADM will be executed in ten,

192
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,541
passengers should
evacuate immediately.

193
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,500
Counting down. Six.

194
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,916
Don't do it. Stop it, Batist.

195
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,375
[AI]
Three. Two. One.

196
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,208
[screams]

197
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,958
Batist, damn you!

198
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,500
What, going somewhere?

199
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,333
[gasps]

200
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,250
Well, well, well. Since I
don't see you giving up,

201
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,000
I guess we'll have to fight
to the bitter end.

202
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,666
Won't we?

203
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,166
[GRAY]
Batist! Jackson!

204
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,875
[ARBALEST A.I.] No response
from Jackson's machine.

205
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,625
[gasping]

[GRAY gasps]

207
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,875
It really isn't anybody's fault.

208
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,875
These things often happen
on the battlefield,

209
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:17,958
but you can understand
that... Right, Kashim?

210
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,666
[GRAY]
Don't worry about me.

211
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:26,583
There's no need. Your mission
is to make it home, Sousuke.

212
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,750
[SOUSUKE gasps]

213
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,666
Zaied!

214
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,083
K-Kashim...

215
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,208
[panting]

216
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,291
Miss Gray, I'm coming.

217
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,125
All right, Gauron,
where are you?!

218
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:46,083
[GAURON] If you want it, why
don't you just come and get it?

219
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,875
[SOUSUKE] Because, I'd
rather kill you first!

220
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:53,833
Huh, wasn't quite as easy as
catching a sparrow, was it?

221
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,333
But please, amuse me.

222
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,041
[ARBALEST A.I.]
Heat source rapidly approaching

223
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,583
at 5 o'clock.

224
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,541
AI, now listen to me!
Start the Lambda Driver!

225
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,750
[ARBALEST A.I.]
Roger.

226
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,708
Show me how it's done!

227
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,000
Goodbye, Gauron!

228
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:26,375

[SOUSUKE panting]

230
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,583
Zaied... but...

231
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,208
[ARBALEST A.I.]
Performing thermal scan.

232
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,875
Reserve magazine contains
unused bullets.

233
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:12,125
Like I told you... the soldier
who wins is the one who

234
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:16,333
saves a few rounds and keeps
them in a reserve magazine.

235
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,416
Why don't you...
say something... Sousuke?

236
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,833
[SOUSUKE]
No problem.

237
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:01,125
[KANAME] Whoa! All of a sudden,
he said we should take

238
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:04,125
a summer vacation, just the
two of us. Of course I want

239
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,125
some nice memories,
but I need some time

240
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,916
before my heart
is ready for that.

241
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,250
[SOUSUKE] Next Full Metal Panic:
"Deep Sea Party."

242
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:12,791
Kaname, have you ever
parachuted before?

243
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:14,666
[KANAME]
Huh?
