1
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,041
[TELETHA] He's having a
tough time out there, isn't he?

2
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:45,125
[KALININ] I believed it would
give him some good experience.

3
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,375
[TELETHA]
Good experience?

4
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,583
Even though he returned to the
safe house chained to a chair

5
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,458
with his firearms confiscated

6
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,333
and after being
physically assaulted

7
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:58,041
by the mission objective
and several other civilians?

8
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,416
Still within the allowable
range, Madam Captain.

9
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,125
I guess it'll be fine.

10
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:07,625
Sgt. Major Mao and Sgt.
Weber will be there to help him.

11
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,708
[TELETHA]
But, tell me Lt. Commander...

12
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,791
How long were we planning
to leave them in Tokyo?

13
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:16,041
[KALININ] As long as it takes
to eliminate the threat.

14
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,833
Now that the weight of the
mission has shifted to us,

15
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,458
would I be correct
in assuming that

16
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,500
if we make our
secondary objective,

17
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,083
we won't need to post a
guard for Miss Chidori?

18
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,625
[KALININ] Yes. Not only Chidori,
but all the other

19
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,916
Whispered candidates
will be safe as well.

20
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,375
They'll all be safe
for a while, anyway...

21
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,000
[KALININ]
Yes. For a while...

22
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,583
[KANAME growls]

23
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,083
So, what got him to
come running this time?

24
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,791
Like I'd ever know.

25
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,708
I was carrying this
plaster sculpture for art,

26
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,375
and he just runs into
me shouting something

27
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,750
I can't make out.

28
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,208
Can you blame me for not
knowing what he's thinking?

29
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,666
There, there.

30
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,750
It was an accident. I slipped.

31
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,125
[KANAME groans]

32
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,041
[KANAME]
Right. You just bumped into me.

33
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,916
The sprinting and shouting
had nothing to do with it.

34
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,125
Look, do me a favor
and shut up, okay?

35
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,583
[KYOKO giggles]

36
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,208
[KURZ] What's the matter?
You do something bad?

37
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,375
I thought I saw a terrorist

38
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,916
attacking Miss Chidori
in the hallway,

39
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,208
but it turned out to be a
plaster sculpture she had made

40
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,750
for art class.

41
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,583
She should be coming outside
the school gate any minute now,

42
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,625
but I have to stay after
and report to the teacher.

43
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,166
Cover for me, will ya?

44
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,541
Hey, I'm on it, but don't waste
your time worrying about it.

45
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,333
[SOUSUKE]
I'll try.

[KURZ chuckles]

47
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,083
[MELISSA] Sounds like you're
having a tough time adjusting.

Trust me, you're not
the only one

Ugh, these Tokyo prices
are deadly! What is the deal?!

53
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,708
It's just crab! We're on an
island! Canned freakin' crab?!

So I scared ya, huh?

I have never ever had
a new transfer student

cause so many problems!

I'm very sorry, ma'am.

[TEACHER]
And another thing!

74
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,291
You cannot bring toys
like these to school!

75
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,500
I told you yesterday!
Perhaps you've forgotten?!

No, that gun is not a toy.

[TEACHER]
Oh, enough already!

79
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,458
[KANAME] So what's with
this hobby of yours?

80
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,625
Do you just like taking pictures
of weird or funny stuff?

81
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,625
Uhh... I guess so.

82
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:25,291
[KANAME] Okay... So why take
pictures of that bozo?

83
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,791
[KYOKO]
Hmm... I dunno.

84
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,291
As goofy as he is, watching
him and the way he acts

85
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,791
sorta brightens my day.
It's like a breath of fresh air.

It seems our angel has finally
decided to go to sleep.

Watch what you're doing!

89
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,833
[KURZ] I could say the same
to you! Two days, man.

90
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:53,500
You'll be dead by the time
you finish the mission.

91
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,958
Lemme see your back, man.

92
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,041
[KURZ] Y'know, you haven't
run into an enemy yet.

93
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,333
And in two days,

94
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,416
you've fallen down
the stairs, broke a window,

95
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,583
knocked over a bookcase
in the library,

96
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,500
and generally taken masochism
to a whole new level.

I'm trying to do my best.

98
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:11,750
Sousuke's point man because he
can do all those crazy stunts.

99
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,083
Of course, you should
know that by now.

100
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,416
So laugh all you want,

101
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,125
but it won't be too funny
if the terrorists attack

and he's not running
on all cylinders.

I doubt she's
even a real target.

106
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,041
[SOUSUKE] Blind assumptions
lead to trouble, you know?

00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,208
And rabid obsession
leads to stitches.

everyday ordinary girl.

I mean, sure, she's
pretty and everything,

112
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,958
but her background's
fairly normal.

113
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,791
At least, if you compare
it with our backgrounds.

114

[MELISSA] Yeah, teenage
mercenaries aren't exactly

what you'd call normal.

116
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,833
[KURZ] You have to wonder
what good it's doing the KGB

117
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,666
to try and kidnap a regular
high school student.

[MAN] Ha, thank you, chief.
It's good to know the KGB

121
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,666
employs men of understanding.

122
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,875
[MAN]
That's Mithril's AS.

Though I'm afraid none
of your current models

124

[KGB CHIEF]
Mithril?

126
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,625
[MAN] A secret mercenary
agency that destroys

127
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,625
illegal drug refineries
and terrorist camps.

128
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:42,125
In their spare time, they defend
nuclear weapons exports.

129
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,625
Their equipment is
roughly ten years ahead

130
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,666
of the Americans
and the Soviets.

131
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,708
Their top brass also
has a penchant

132
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,125
for sorting out
regional conflicts.

133
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,583
You know, like champions of
justice or something like that.

134

[KGB CHIEF] So, this Mithril
is the one disrupting my plans?

[MAN] My guess is they felt
they couldn't leave you alone.

136

Once a breakthrough is
made in these studies,

the power balance
of the entire world

138
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,916
will be turned on its head.

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,833
Bodies are much more difficult
to come by these days.

140
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,166
[KGB CHIEF]
And you want an increase in pay.

141
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,916
[MAN] I'm not a communist.
I'm just a simple businessman.

We've heard enough from you!

There are plenty of

who can take your place!

145

Maybe you should be thankful

that the chief hired
you at all, Chinaman!

147
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,791
I'm afraid that I'm not
actually of Chinese descent.

[KGB OFFICER]
Who gives a damn?!

149
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,416
We'll send you to

150
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,125

Now that that's out of the way,
let's get on to business.

154
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,541
I believe we were talking
about securing bodies

for experiments
on the Whispered.

I'm thinking of
kidnapping this girl.

Bye-bye, Mr. Pervert!

318
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,041
[KANAME gasps]

319
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,625
[SOUSUKE grunts]

320
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:46,875
[KANAME gasps]

321
00:16:55,791 --> 00:17:01,041
Hey, Sousuke. Sousuke!
Sousuke Sagara!

322
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,083
Hey, Sousuke, are you alright?

323
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,416
[SOUSUKE] Yes.
There's nothing wrong with me.

324
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,000
Nothing wrong with you?!

325
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,291
What on earth were you
thinking back there?!

326
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,791
I just wanted to get out at
this station all of a sudden.

327
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,083
It has nothing to
do with you, okay?

328
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,500
So you mean to tell me
after all this time...?

329
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,875
It's still a coincidence.

330
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,500
[KANAME sighs]

331
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,583
[KANAME sighs]

332
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,625
Lemme guess. Your choosing to
sit here is also a coincidence?

333
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,083
Uh-huh.

334
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,500
[KANAME]
I can't take this anymore.

335
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,875
Hmph!

336
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,875
[KANAME]
Hey, Sousuke.

337
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,208
Uh, yes?

338
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,500
[KANAME]
I promise I won't get angry;

339
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,458
I just want a straight answer.

340
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,125
[SOUSUKE] I take it you want
to know what coincidence

341
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,916
it was that brought me here.

342
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
[KANAME groans]

343
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,708
[KANAME]
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

344
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,041
Then, as someone who also
just happened to be here,

345
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,041
can I ask you something?

346
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,708
What's that?

347
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,125
[KANAME] You've lived overseas
for a long time, right?

348
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,333
Were you like this
at your other schools?

349
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,458
[SOUSUKE] Yes. I enjoyed
peaceful days like this one.

350
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,166
[KANAME]
Okay... But aren't you sad

351
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,958
to be away from
your old friends?

352
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:24,291
[SOUSUKE] No. We keep in touch
through telephone and post,

353
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,833
so I guess I'm not technically
separated from them.

354
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,375
[KANAME] You have a weird way
of answering questions.

355
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,541
Do you have a girl?

356
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,916
[SOUSUKE]
A girl?

357
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,291
[KANAME] A girlfriend!
A lover, someone like that.

358
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,708
[SOUSUKE] No, I... don't have
any friends of that nature.

359
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,625
[KANAME]
Hmm... Is that so...?

360
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,791
[SOUSUKE] According to my
colleague-- I mean, my friend,

361
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,125
There's no woman in the world
who would be my girlfriend,

362
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,041
even in the remotest
corner of the tundra.

363
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,708
But I've never known
quite what to make

364
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,458
of some of the things he says.

365
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,416
[KANAME laughs]

366
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,666
Your friend's a funny guy,
you know that?

367
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,000
You know what he means?

368
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,250
[KANAME]
Yeah!

369
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,791
I mean, you are a bit
of an odd bird, Sousuke.

370
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:01,833
Odd bird?

371
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,416
You might even say,
extremely odd.

372
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,125
[KANAME giggles]

373
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,708
[KANAME]
But maybe...

374
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:14,250
Even with that rare
personality of yours,

375
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,666
you just might find someone
nice who'll understand you.

376
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,458
You think so, huh?

377
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,208
Someone... nice...

378
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,625
From what I can gather,
you seem like a nice person.

379
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,083
Now, wait a second,

380
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:34,625
I wasn't trying to be all
serious or anything. Ugh...

381
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,541
Very well, I will
disregard what you said.

382
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,875
[KANAME gasps]

383
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,208
You're pretty weird, all right.

384
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:46,125
[KANAME laughs]

385
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,291
[KANAME]
Make that really weird!

386
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,666
Really, really weird!

387
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,833
[KANAME laughs]

388
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,166
[MAN]
Hm?

389
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,583
[rumbling]

390
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,208
[CAT hisses]

391
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,791
Oops!

392
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,375
[KURZ sighs]

393
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,791
Oh boy.

394

[DOG barks]

395
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,458
[GIRL]
I'm really sorry, sir!

396
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,166
Fairy! What's the
matter with you?!

397
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:27,750
[FAIRY growls]

398
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,791
Did they notice me...?

399
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,666
Well, thank god.

400
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,833
[KURZ]
Damn, that was close.

401
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,500
[KURZ] Sousuke's got me doing
too many things at once.

402
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,333
Hm...?

403
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,083
I don't believe it...

404
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,916
There's no reason for
a grown man to litter...

405
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,916
[KYOKO]
So, what happened?

406
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,333
Did anything good happen
to you on the way home? Hmm?

407
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,875
[KANAME]
No, nothing!

408
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,750
[KYOKO]
Nothing between you and Sousuke?

409
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,666
[KANAME]
Ah! Oh, please, Kyoko!

410
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,958
Nothing could ever happen
between me and that maniac!

411
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:20,125
[KANAME laughs]

412
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,166
[KANAME]
Too funny!

413
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,125
[KYOKO]
Yes, yes, I keep forgetting.

414
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,125
Hey, did you study
for tomorrow's test?

415
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,458
It's gonna be bright and early!

416
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,833
[KANAME]
Test?! What test?!

417
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,333
[KYOKO]
The kanji test!

418
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,708
The teacher said she'd decide
groups for the school trip

419
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,125
based on our scores.

420
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,250
[KANAME] I didn't hear
anything about that! Nothing!

421
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,333
[KYOKO]
Oh, Kaname, you're okay.

422
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,708
[KANAME]
No, I'm not okay...!

423
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:00,291
[KANAME]
I know it's not a good idea

424
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:01,750
to let my guard down around him,

425
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:04,250
but I didn't think he'd be
pawing through my underwear!

426
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:07,166
I was right, wasn't I?
Total pervert.

427
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,500
Next Full Metal Panic,
Episode 3: "Lingerie Panic."

428
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:14,416
Come here, Sousuke. I've got
something I wanna show you...

429
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,875
[SOUSUKE]
Why're you so angry?
