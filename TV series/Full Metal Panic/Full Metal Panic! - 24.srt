[MARDUKAS]
Yes, ma'am.

163
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,625
[TELETHA]
Lieutenant William Goddard.

164
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,458
Yes, ma'am.

165
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,416
Second Lieutenant Bob Riley.

166
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,333
Yes, ma'am.

167
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,291
Second Lieutenant Stuart Argyle.

168
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,166
Yes, ma'am.

169
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,083
[TELETHA]
Lieutenant Gale McAllen.

170
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,750
[MCALLEN]
Of course, ma'am. I'm honored.

171
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,000
[TELETHA gasps]

172
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,541
Lieutenant...

173
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,791
Lieutenant Gale McAllen
is out on patrol, ma'am.

174
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,291
Sergeant Major Melissa Mao.

175
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,541
Ma'am.

176
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,291
Sergeant Kurz Weber.

177
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,541
Right here.

178
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,125
Sergeant Sousuke Sagara.

179
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,375
Ma'am.

180
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,750
Leading seaman, Lian Shaopin.

181
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:41,000
He's out on patrol,
Madam Captain.

182
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:37,000
She's been there
for ten minutes.

183
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,250
Sousuke, why don't you go over?

184
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,416
Uh?

185
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,833
And try and cheer her up.

186
00:18:56,125 --> 00:19:02,416
[TELETHA sobbing]

187
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,625
[SOUSUKE]
Kaname!

188
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,833
[KANAME]
Yeah?

189
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,708
Sousuke!

190
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,333
I wanted to know if you could
come with me, Kaname.

191
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,791
[KANAME]
Huh?

192
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,875
[KANAME] You're not
gonna do anything weird?

193
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,708
I won't do anything weird.

194
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,583
[KANAME]
It's not dangerous, is it?

195
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,125
[SOUSUKE]
No, it's not dangerous.

196
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,125
Well, here it is.

197
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:55,625
[KANAME]
Uh... Oh!

198
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,875
[KANAME laughs]

199
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,708
[KANAME]
What is this?

200
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,083
A fishing rod, of course.

201
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,208
Not that, silly. This place.

202
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:17,083
My secret fishing spot.
I'm the only one who knows it.

203
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,541
Fishing? But if I'm taking
the flight to Tokyo,

204
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,666
I can only spend 40 minutes
here before I have to go.

205
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,916
[SOUSUKE]
I don't mind.

206
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,500
This was the very first
target of this mission.

207
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,958
[KANAME]
Huh?

208
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:36,166
Originally, I was planning
on taking you here.

209
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,458
But somehow we ended up
taking all those detours.

210
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,041
[KANAME]
Take me here?

211
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,708
Affirmative.

212
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,583
You should fish.
You might even catch one.

213
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,125
Even in the time we have left.

214
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,958
I've never seen anybody
catch something that fast.

215
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,500
You never know.

216
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,458
When I'm with you, I feel I
can do just about anything.

217
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,916
Whether it's catching
a gigantic fish, or...

218
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,750
Or escaping from
some terrible danger.

219
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,708
[SOUSUKE] I know it's only
30 minutes, but will you stay?

220
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,333
[KANAME]
Is that what you really feel?

221
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,750
[SOUSUKE]
Of course.

222
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:16,375
I'm here now, because you
were always there for me.

223
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,875
All right. Tell you what,

224
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,583
why don't we test
your little theory,

225
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,208
and see if your
lucky streak holds out.

226
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,375
Uh! Help me, Sousuke! Uh!

227
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,583
It's huge!

228
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,333
You think it's a sea bream?!

229
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,166
You just might be right.

230
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,958
What about a whale?!

231
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,125
Well, I can't deny that
there's a possibility of that.

232
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:38,541
Listen, I wanna catch this thing
and bring it home, Sousuke.

233
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,083
[SOUSUKE]
Roger!
