[GAURON] Are you implying
that I'd fail at this?

What we're saying is
we can't trust a courier

[KANAME]
What is this?

12
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,208
A gate for the school festival.

13
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,583
It's pretty
impressive, isn't it?

14
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,708
It looks nothing like
a festival gate!

00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,250
Please explain yourself!

16
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,041
I heard that the theme for last
year's festival was "peace."

17
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,416
So this year's theme
is "security."

18
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,208
The gate will double
as an observation tower

19
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,875
where we can post a guard
for people's safety.

20
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,666
It's designed to stand
for a long time,

21
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,958
even if a heavily armed
terrorist decides to come

22
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,875
and attack the school festival.

think it was possible,

but your war mania
is getting even worse.

25

I mean, what's the deal? Is it
eating away at your brain?

And you people!

27
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,208
Don't you have any questions
about this whole thing?

28
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:21,041
Well, in all honesty,
we agreed with Sousuke's idea

29
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,500
that anybody should be able to
come to the school festival

30
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,541
and feel completely safe.

31
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,833
The only one who would feel safe
around that eyesore is Sousuke!

32
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,083
Oh well... maybe you're right.

33
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,916
Maybe peace has made us
forget about security.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,833
But if you've got it in your
head to build an entrance

35
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:38,833
that costs 1,471,000 yen,
you're out of your mind!

Ah, so you noticed.

00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,166
If we're lucky, we may be able
to obtain some triple-plated

39

It usually costs somewhere
around 5 million yen for--

Uh, what did you do that for?

41
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,000
Don't you realize that
the entire budget

42
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:58,125
for the school festival
is only 1,500,000 yen?

43
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:01,041
If we go with your idea, we
won't have any other attractions

00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,833
Going to the Perio Islands.
Is that correct, Madam Captain?

158
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,625
It's a chemical weapons threat.

159
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,125
From what I understand,
an armed group attacked

160
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,666
and occupied the
dismantling facility there.

161
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,375
It doesn't sound very promising.
If they decide to bomb

162
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,833
the warehouses where the
chemicals are being stored...

163
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,458
[TELETHA] We'll have a serious
problem to deal with.

164
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,666
That little nation could
be completely destroyed.

165
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,041
[MARDUKAS] Well, I would imagine
the US military will be sending

166
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,625
in their AS Special Forces.

167
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,500
I hope that'll be
enough to handle it.

168
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,416
[coughs]

169
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,708
Kaname...

170
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:05,333
[KANAME] What do you want,
Mr. Sergeant Sagara?

171
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,250
Please let me know if you're
feeling at all inconvenienced.

172
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,458
I'll try and meet your
needs as best I can.

173
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,250
[KANAME] I am. But I'm not
gonna bother you with it,

174
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,833
because it's not
a problem you can solve.

175
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,666
Sergeant! We have an incoming
radio call from Melida Island.

176
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,250
[sighs]

177
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,583
Understood.

178
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,083
Go ahead.

179
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,750
[KURZ] You need to meet up
with and board the de Danaan,

180
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:32,375
which is now cruising. And be
sure to bring Kaname with you.

181
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,833
Are you sure?

182
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,375
But, Kurz, she's a civilian.

183
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,583
Sorry, bro, Tessa's order.
Besides, all things considered,

184
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,041
the de Danaan is probably
the safest place on Earth

185
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,333
for Kaname to be.

186
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:45,250
Huh. Then I'll be
taking her with me.

187
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,333
[door clicks]

188
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,625
[SOUSUKE]
Do you have a bathing suit?

189
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,166
Uh... I, uh I guess so.

190
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,333
Then please change.

191
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,333
You can use the
far end of the cabin.

192
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,458
Once you finish, put your
belongings in this bag.

193
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,958
All of them.

194
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,083
What's going on? Hey!

195
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,750
[SOUSUKE]
Hurry up, we don't have time!

196
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,750
So what's the deal?

197
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,666
Why are you dressed like that?

198
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,208
You're gonna need to
put this on. Quickly.

199
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,833
Nevermind, I'll do it.
We're short on time.

200
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,666
[KANAME]
Wait! Ah! W-What are...

201
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,041
Sergeant, you got one minute.

202
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,208
Yes, I know.

203
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,500
[PILOT]
There's no time for a re-do.

204
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,791
[SOUSUKE]
I know. It's okay.

205
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,708
Hey, what exactly are you...

206
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,750
30 seconds!

207
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,833
I appreciate it. See you later.

208
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,000
See you later?

209
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,416
[gasping]

210
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,125
[KANAME]
Wh-What are you talking about?

211
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,208
[gasps]

212
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,208
[SOUSUKE]
Okay, let's go!

213
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:48,166
Let's go?! Don't tell me you're
gonna jump out of this airplane!

214
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,041
[SOUSUKE]
Affirmative!

215
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,666
[KANAME screams]

216
00:11:56,125 --> 00:12:03,208
Blue sky. Blue ocean.
Just the two of us.

217
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,875
[OPERATOR]
Ocean splash down confirmed.

218
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,916
Uh, the two people who
just landed are strugglin'

219
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,583
on the water's surface.
They may be drowning.

220
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,416
I can hear splashing noises
and screamin'. It sounds bad.

221
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,916
Please, patch us in quickly
so I can hear them.

222
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,541
[SOUSUKE]
Chidori! Stop!

223
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:24,875
[KANAME]
Shut up!

224
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,250
Have you ever given thought
to how I might feel?

225
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:32,625
I could've killed myself. You
are the worst kind, you loser!

226
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,958
You can just leave
them out there.

227
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,083
[KANAME]
Jerk!

228
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,208
Hi and welcome aboard the Tuatha
de Danaan, Miss Kaname Chidori.

229
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,958
You look a little exhausted.

230
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,291
Of course I am.

231
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,583
After getting dumped from
a plane into the ocean

232
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,458
and then having to dive,
anyone except Sergeant Sabotage

233
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,250
is bound to get
exhausted. Really.

234
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,916
I'm so sorry. Originally,
I was going to

235
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,541
invite you to the base
out on Melida Island,

236
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,000
but the situation here
has changed a bit.

237
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,833
It's all right, I really
wanted to see you too, Tessa.

238
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,000
And you've got a lot of things

239
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,666
you want to talk to
me about, don't you?

240
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,125
Yes, I do. However...

241
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,458
Sergeant Sagara?

242
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,750
[SOUSUKE]
Yes, Captain?

243
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,958
Please head on over
to the main hangar.

244
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,375
And could you tell anyone there

245
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,125
that Miss Kaname and I
will be there momentarily.

246
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,875
As you wish, Captain.

247
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:41,958
--[TELETHA] Miss Kaname...
--Huh?

248
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,708
If you wouldn't mind,
why don't you go ahead and

249
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,208
change into your plain clothes.

250
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,000
And I'll give you a tour
around the submarine.

251
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,083
[TELETHA] This feels
rather narrow, doesn't it?

252
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,625
But it's actually quite
roomy for a submarine.

253
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,083
I've given every thought to
the staff's safety because

254
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,333
they may need to run through
here in an emergency situation.

255
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,250
Thanks to this,
we've had no reports of

256
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,625
clumsy people running into
things and falling-- [yelps]

257
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:05,375
...over.

258
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,666
Are you... all right?

259
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,958
Yes. I'm fine. I'm fine.
This is nothing.

260
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,833
You seem a bit unsteady.

261
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:16,791
Are you really an
honest-to-god Captain, Tessa?

262
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,875
You know it hurts when
people ask me that question.

263
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,625
This ship is my home, and I
assure you that I know all

264
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,833
there is to know about it and
everything that goes on inside.

265
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:29,958
That is, within the proper
bounds of privacy of course.

266
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,541
Please, come this way.

267
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,000
Though I'm afraid you may not
like what you're about to see.

268
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,500
[MARDUKAS]
Attention!

269
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,541
[gasps]

270
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,083
To Miss Kaname Chidori,

271
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,166
for her great bravery,
resolve, and kindness

272
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,333
when our group and Captain
Testarossa faced so many crises.

273
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,791
Everyone with deepest
appreciation, salute!

274
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,208
The moment they heard you were
coming aboard, they all wanted

275
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,958
to pay their deepest respects
to you, Miss Kaname.

276
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:22,416
Uh, I... I'm really,
you know, very honored, but,

277
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,750
I, uh, didn't do all these
great things you said.

278
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:26,875
[MARDUKAS]
Miss Chidori,

279
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,541
what you did would
have been difficult

280
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:32,208
even for the most respected
and capable soldier.

281
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,041
You should be proud of yourself.

282
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,583
Everything that the commander
said about you is true.

283
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,625
You should be proud.

284
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:49,625
[applause, cheering]

285
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,083
Well, the welcome
ceremony is over now.

286
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,625
And FYI, we're going to be
throwing a little party

287
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,208
right here on board the ship.

288
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,708
We do hope you'll join
us in celebrating.

289
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,708
Party?

290
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,083
Yes. Well, you see...

291
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:05,125
Today is this baby's
first birthday.

292
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,791
[KURZ] All right! It's time
for submarine bingo!

293
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,500
Allow me to announce the
fabulous first prize!

294
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:19,000
It's such a great prize,
I wish I were competing!

295
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,416
What will the winner get?

296
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,750
That's right! A hot steamy kiss
from Captain Testarossa!

297
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,333
[GUYS]
Yeah! Woohoo!

298
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,208
Mr. Weber! I didn't hear
anything about this!

299
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,541
But you told me...

300
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,333
"Please let me know
if there's anything

301
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,083
I can do for the party!"

302
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,750
It's what you said!

303
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,416
[TELETHA]
Ye-Yes I said that, but...

304
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,041
If the smooching idea is
bothering you that much,

305
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,250
how 'bout your favorite
underwear then?

306
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,083
That's even worse!

307
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,041
It's your kiss
then. All right!

308
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,333
We've got the Captain's
okay. Let's begin!

309
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,333
[GUYS cheer]

310
00:16:56,541 --> 00:17:00,208
[KURZ] O-65. How's that?
Now I know someone's gotta be

311
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:05,833
