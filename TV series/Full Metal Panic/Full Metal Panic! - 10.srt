1
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,291
[gasps] Ah!

2
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,041
Captain, get down, now!

3
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,625
[KALININ groans]

4
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,333
Sagara, I'm so glad.

5
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,833
Oh, good evening.

6
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,791
[KANAME]
Uh... Good evening...

7
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,833
Here, you guys can split this.

8
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,416
Uh, Kaname...

9
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,000
[KANAME]
She's a cute girlfriend.

10
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,500
I'm sorry I disturbed you.

11
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,500
Uh, I'm afraid you're

12
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,166
misunderstanding
something, Kaname.

13
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,125
I'm sorry. I was meddling
without knowing the details.

14
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,250
I must have been
bothering you for a while.

15
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,000
No, but really,
that's not true at all.

16
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:21,166
[KANAME] It's fine. There's no
need to get worked up about it.

17
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,916
I'm not angry. I just
feel guilty. That's all.

18
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,083
[SOUSUKE]
Kaname...

19
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,708
You're Miss Kaname
Chidori, aren't you?

20
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,041
Huh?

21
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,041
So, what you're saying is
there's a terrorist group

22
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,000
known as A21 after you

23
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:41,125
and they're trying to get
that boy, Takuma, back.

24
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,250
Is that it?

25
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,458
Yes, that's correct.

26
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,458
[KANAME]
And the girl sitting next to you

27
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,541
is your superior office,
Miss Captain, right?

28
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,958
[SOUSUKE]
Also correct.

29
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,291
[KANAME]
Okay, Miss Testarossa?

30
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,208
Yes, Teletha Testarossa,

31
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,750
but all my good friends
call me Tessa.

32
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:57,875
How old are you?

33
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,458
Sixteen years old.

34
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,250
Ugh...

35
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,250
Lemme tell ya something.
I've seen a whole lot

36
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,958
of old war movies and
the submarine captain

37
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:09,125
is always a middle-aged man
with a mustache or a beard.

38
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,958
She's more the type to play
"Ensign A" who at most

39
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,250
gets to come on deck
and read off a telegram.

40
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,666
[SOUSUKE]
I assure you. It's true.

41
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,916
Ugh, I don't care what
kind of relationship

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,833
you have with this girl,
because in the end,

43
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,875
it's absolutely
none of my business.

44
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,458
What bugs me is your
total lack of morals.

45
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,875
Would you normally tell
such an obvious lie?

46
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,958
[SOUSUKE]
Captain...

47
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,291
Madam Captain?

48
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:35,041
Oh, right. You're talking
to me, aren't you? What?

49
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,041
I would greatly appreciate
it if you'd help me

50
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,041
explain this situation
to Miss Chidori.

51
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:43,583
Uh, let's see... I'm in
charge of, uh, what wast it?

52
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:47,166
Attack submarine? And I'm
a captain in the military

53
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,375
and also Sousuke's boss.

54
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,583
Yes, it's all true,
Miss Kaname Chidori.

55
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,208
Um, uh, Captain...

56
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,583
Have I missed anything,
Sergeant Sagara?

57
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,750
[SEINA]
I guess you're awake.

58
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,875
So, what is it you want?

59
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,250
[SEINA]
I wanna talk to you.

60
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,333
Do you think you'll be able

61
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,000
to extract any
information out of me?

62
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,916
I'm not expecting too much.

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,833
You're injured enough that
torture would kill you

64
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,375
before you had a
chance to speak out.

65
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,458
[KALININ]
Then why did you save me?

66
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,958
I told you. I simply
wanted to talk to you.

67
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,541
That's all there is to it.

68
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,958
Anyway, who you and
your people are

69
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,791
isn't really that important.

70
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,333
How can you stand there
and say such a thing?

71
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,541
Your group appears to be
completely unrelated

72
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,916
to this country's
larger institutions.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,375
Any organization lacking
that kind of support

74
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,958
poses no threat to us,

75
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,333
no matter how
capable its people.

76
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:50,666
It's seems to me that you're a
rather capable leader yourself.

77
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,208
I'm not so sure.

78
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,833
Seems I remember having a much
more capable leader with us.

79
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,666
Well, I see how it is.

80
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,166
I consider myself a
very patient person.

81
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,250
So I'll just leave it at
what you two have said,

82
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,041
and drop the subject

83
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,291
[TAKUMA]
Hmph.

84
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,291
And you, you've been
smirking over there

85
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,750
in the cornor for a while now,

86
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,875
and it's really starting
to get on my nerves, okay?

87
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,833
Forgive me, Miss Kaname Chidori.

88
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,833
[KANAME]
Give it up. You're not cute.

89
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,791
I'd like to see your
parents' faces right now.

90
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,208
I'll bet they
spoiled you rotten.

91
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,916
Heh. Are ya angry now?

92
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,125
Are you gonna say,

93
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,958
"You better not talk
bad about my mommy"?

94
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,791
I don't have a mother.

95
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,291
Oh...

96
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,625
Imagine that.

97
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,750
It's the same with me and
Sergeant Sousuke here.

98
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:35,958
Did ya think you're the only one

99
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,000
in the world living
without your parents?

100
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,625
Gimme a break.

101
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,083
Look, it doesn't matter
whether your mom is dead

102
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,583
or just a deadbeat;
the end result is the same:

103
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,583
you're still a spoiled brat

104
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,083
and chances are,
that's all you'll ever be.

105
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,541
[TAKUMA, KANAME scream]

106
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,083
Wh-What the heck's his deal?

107
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,750
[SOUSUKE]
Captain!

108
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,375
What's the matter?

109
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,250
Look at this.

110
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,166
It's a transmitter.

111
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,541
A transmitter?

112
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,916
It's propbably sending a
signal every few minutes

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,625
to let someone know where he is.

114
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,541
[SOUSUKE] Stay away from the
windows and the front door!

115
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,750
Captain, could you remove it?

116
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,541
I have a utility knife and some
anesthetic here in this kit.

117
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,958
[TELETHA] I suppose
there's no other choice,

118
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:33,250
but you know I don't have
any surgical training.

119
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,958
Guess I'll have to do it then.

120
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,500
Hold on, I'm not quite sure
I understand all this,

121
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,541
but you need to break
the transmitter, right?

122
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,750
Please stay back!
I'm busy right now.

123
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,166
Why don't you use that?

124
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,416
[SOUSUKE, TELETHA]
Hmm?

125
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,083
We should only do it
for a few seconds.

126
00:07:56,166 --> 00:08:00,208
Okay! How 'bout we set it
for five seconds on high?

127
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,041
[KANAME]
Here goes...

128
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
[microwave beeps]

129
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:09,833
I'd say that should be enough

130
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,583
to toast any
precision instrument.

131
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,791
I've never heard of such a
reckless way to go about it.

132
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,458
Well it did the job, didn't it?

133
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,333
It's a little early
to start relaxing.

134
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,708
Once our enemies find out that
the transmitter is useless,

135
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,250
they'll intiate their assualt.

136
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,416
With all due respect,
we need to move out, now.

137
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,333
But if they know the
location of this room,

138
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,291
then they're propbably already
watching the entrance.

139
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,958
[KANAME] Yeah, yeah. In that
case, you two should find a way

140
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,375
to sneak out together.

141
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,916
I'm going home.

142
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,458
Don't go, because the enemies
will attack you, too.

143
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,041
Why me? I have nothing
to do with all this.

144
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,625
Technically, that's true,
but I'm afraid

145
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,791
I got you involved
the moment I let you in.

146
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,333
Leave me alone! Why don't you
protect your girlfriend!

147
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,875
She's the one who needs you.

148
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,250
[TELETHA]
Miss Chidori...

149
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,291
Sagara was telling
you the truth.

150
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,083
[KANAME]
Huh? But earlier you--

151
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,875
It was a joke I took too far.

152
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,416
You may find it hard to believe,

153
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,958
but I really am his
commanding officer.

154
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,666
Please, come with us for
your safety and ours.

155
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,208
Okay, fine then. But I'm just
going along for the ride.

156
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,791
And that's it.

157
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,625
[TELETHA] Is this your
high school, Mr. Sagara?

158
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,458
[SOUSUKE] I figured here we
have the least probability

159
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,000
of involivng other people,

160
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,791
and we're still
close to safe house.

161
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,208
So, how long of a wait
are we looking at then?

162
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,125
I contacted HQ via satellite
and got confirmation that

163
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,375
Sgt. Major Mao is supposed to
make it here within two hours.

164
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,791
[chuckles] Hate to
burst your bubble,

165
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,833
but my friends are
gonna get here first.

166
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,291
It'll be the same no matter
where you try to hide.

167
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,166
[KANAME]
Uh, I broke your transmitter...

168
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,083
[gasps]

169
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,750
...with a microwave oven.

170
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,083
Uh--

171
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,333
Now then...

172
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,541
Kaname, who are you calling?

173
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,500
I need to ask Kyoko
to tape a TV program.

174
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,833
I can't miss it this week,

175
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,750
because we finally
find out whether or not

176
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,625
the heroine comes
out of the coma.

177
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,083
Don't you'll give
away our location.

178
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:59,833
Look, I don't mind watching TV
right here, but if I do that,

179
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,750
then somebody outside might
notice that we're in this room.

180
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,916
I'm considering your situation.

181
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,750
Even though I have
nothing to do with it

182
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,708
and got involved
against my will.

183
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,041
You think you're
the only authority

184
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,458
when it comes to emergency
situations, don't you?

185
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,750
It's a real bad habit
of yours, Sousuke.

186
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,125
Try breaking it

187
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,500
Hey, Kyoko? It's me.

188
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,708
Do ya think you could
do me a favor?

189
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,250
Mr. Sagara, when
Miss Chidori talks to you,

190
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,833
is she always that way?

191
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:27,958
Well, not all the time,

192
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,000
but she definitely
has her moments.

193
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,083
I thought you were both
on friendlier terms,

194
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,916
because she brought you that
box of the food she cooked.

195
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,166
Uh, no, we're not in that
kind of relationship.

196
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,083
The fact is, I'm still
struggling to establish

197
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,416
a feeling of mutual
trust with her.

198
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,250
Oh. [giggles]

199
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,416
Glad to hear it.

200
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,708
Huh?

201
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,791
[TAKUMA]
Pretty relaxed, aren't you?

202
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,625
You do know that my
friends wouldn't give up

203
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,708
just because the
transmitter was broken.

204
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,458
As long as you have
me hostage here,

205
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,458
they'll be tracking you down
to the ends of the Earth

206
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,041
if they need to.

207
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,250
[gasps]

208
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,958
There is a way to solve
a problem like this.

209
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,541
So, are you gonna kill me?

210
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,208
If I need to, then yes.

211
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,000
[TELETHA]
No, Mr. Sagara, don't!

212
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,416
I'm afraid it's the most
rational option that we have.

213
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,833
I agree, but if we kill him,
we won't be any different

214
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,666
than the terrorists that
we're always fighting against.

215
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,375
Why we created this group,

216
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,875
what we're doing right now--
it wouldn't make any sense.

217
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,666
Do you think that I'm
just being too naïve?

218
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,541
No.

219
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,916
You should probably consider
thanking her for this.

220
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,375
I see, so now I'm supposed
to feel a debt of gratitude,

221
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,833
is that it?

222
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,916
[TELETHA] I didn't stop him
to make you feel that way.

223
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,541
How silly and
self-gratifying of you.

224
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,958
You really do like keeping
the moral high ground,

225
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,166
don't you, Miss Tessa?

226
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,083
It doesn't bother me if
you wanna think that way.

227
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,041
[KANAME]
Hey, what did I miss?

228
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,541
It's not your business.

229
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,708
[yelps]

230
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,291
[KANAME]
What are you trying to do to me?

231
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,708
It was just an
accident. I'm sorry.

232
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,250
[SEINA] Have you ever
heard of Seiji Takechi?

233
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,500
[KALININ]
No.

234
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,333
[SEINA] He was a Japanese
mercenary who went

235
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,500
all around the world fighting
in a number of battles.

236
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:20,125
When he came back, he started
a welfare organization.

237
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,500
It's purpose was correctional

238
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,083
and the name of
the group was A21.

239
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,375
Basically, it was created
for juvenile delinquents

240
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,375
who had been convitcted
of violent crimes.

241
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,750
He gathered a whole
bunch of these

242
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,875
good-for-nothings together
and sent them away

243
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,166
to a deserted island
that he had purchased.

244
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,708
He not only taught them
complete survival skills,

245
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,750
but also how to engage and
defeat an enemy in combat.

246
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,916
They, I mean, we, learned
how to survive and fight

247
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,791
where there was no electricty,
no food, no water...

248
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,541
We built a small
fortune in confidence

249
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,125
and we were so happy
when we realized

250
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,958
that we didn't have to go
around committing crimes

251
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,333
anymore just to survive.

252
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,750
But unfortunately,
a lot of other people

253
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,291
didn't see it that way.

254
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,208
[KANAME yawns]

255
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,375
Well, are they
coming yet, or what?

256
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,291
So, what did you call this
place, Jindai High School?

257
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,500
Does it matter?

258
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:12,583
No, I was just
curious. That's all.

259
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,333
So, Takuma, how big
is your family?

260
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,708
All I have is my
one older sister.

261
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,583
Oh, and what does
your sister do?

262
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,625
What do you care? This
interrogation is supposed

263
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,000
to be about me not
about my family.

264
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,000
It's not an interrogation.

265
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,833
I was simply wondering what
kind of person you are.

266
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:29,916
Ah?

267
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
[TELETHA]
We're having to go through

268
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,791
a lot of hoops because of you.

269
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,708
It wouldn't hurt for you to
chat with me just a little bit,

270
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,041
would it?

271
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,291
Actually, I have an
older brother myself,

272
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,291
but we haven't seen each other
for a long time now.

273
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,666
I managed to get the
exact answer for one of

274
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,875
Albert Einstein's ten element,
nonlinear, simultaneous,

275
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,000
differential equations when
I was only six years old.

276
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:56,375
But, my brother managed to
get it when he was four.

277
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,916
That's good, isn't it?

278
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,833
Yes, but I was always feeling
inferior to my brother.

279
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:03,958
So how...

280
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,125
Hm?

281
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,541
How did you get along
with your brother

282
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,250
if he always made
you feel like that?

283
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,875
My brother was more like...
like my guardian

284
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,166
because he always
watched over me.

285
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,958
Looking back,
it wasn't your normal,

286
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,958
healthy, brother-sister
relationship.

287
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,875
Does your older sister make
you feel like that sometimes?

288
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,000
Wha-What do you--

289
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,083
It's all right. I understand.

290
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:25,958
Take it from me,

291
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,791
I'm someone who's been there.

292
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:33,000
Ah. Maybe you're right
about feeling inferior.

293
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,875
To tell the truth, I've
always looked up to her.

294
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,125
Hey! That's the first time

295
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,875
you've volunteered
something about yourself.

296
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,791
[SEINA] One day, a TV station
found out about our training.

297
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,500
They landed on the island
without permission

298
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,750
and started playing
with our equipment.

299
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:53,750
There was an accident

300
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,166
and it was such a
mess after that.

301
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,250
Everyone accused us.
The truth didn't matter.

302
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,375
They labeled A21
as a terrorist group

303
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,916
and had the training
facility dismantled.

304
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,250
The students' pasts were
revealed to the public.

305
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,541
Including my own.

306
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,291
[SEINA] We wanna paint this
peaceful town in our colors.

307
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,250
And yes, you're absolutely
right to call it revenge.

308
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,750
Because that's
exactly what it is.

309
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,375
Complete and utter destruction.

310
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,750
A town writhing under
a blanket of flame.

311
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,000
That is what I want.

312
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,916
Where are you going?

313
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,083
Is that something you
ask a girl? Seriously.

314
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,333
What are you saying?

315
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,125
I'm going to the bathroom.

316
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,875
Oh, me too. I think
I'll go with you.

317
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,083
I'm coming just in case.

318
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,083
[KANAME, TELETHA]
You stay here.

319
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,041
[KANAME] Doesn't he have
any sense of delicacy?

320
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,791
I can't believe him.

321
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,625
You know what, it's
kinda spooky in here.

322
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:56,833
Yeah, well, this school has

323
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,166
all kinds of scary
stories linked to it.

324
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,291
Like Archie the
spinebending sneek,

325
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,125
the terrifying tale of the
boy who used to go here.

326
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,250
So like, what kind
of story is it?

327
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,458
[KANAME chuckles]
It goes like this...

328
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:13,666
[KANAME whispers]

329
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,083
What a pervert!

330
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,041
I know! Isn't it scary?

331
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,541
Oh, my god, I would die
right there on the spot

332
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,000
if I ever ran into
someone like him.

333
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:27,541
[flush]

334
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,291
[TELETHA] Excuse me, Miss
Chidori? Please don't leave yet.

335
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,375
Okay, but you better hurry up.

336
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,250
[gasps]

337
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,041
They're late.

338
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,541
[cellphone rings]

339
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,958
Sounds like someone found us.

340
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,875
No way!

341
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,125
So you gonna answer it?

342
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,041
[VOICE]
We have two women with us.

343
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,083
Go outside with him, now!

344
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,291
[click]

345
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:05,458
Yep, I stole it when
I tripped that girl.

346
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,166
Then I secretly
called my friends,

347
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,791
and of course, I let
them know where I was.

348
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:13,166
So, what did you call this
place, Jindai High School?

349
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,375
Pretty darn clever of me,
wouldn't you say so?

350
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,833
Don't you try anything stupid.

351
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,375
I don't plan to.
How do we proceed?

352
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,333
[TERRORIST A]
I release one of the women.

353
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,625
You remove the handcuffs.

354
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:50,958
[SOUSUKE]
Agreed!

355
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,541
[TERRORIST A] Which one do
you want released first?

356
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,541
[SOUSUKE] Whoever gets
released first will be safer,

357
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:02,041
but I don't wanna put the second
person in that kind of danger.

358
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,333
Hey, don't worry, Miss Chidori.
You're a civilian.

359
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:09,500
Your safety is top
priority with us.

360
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,166
[SOUSUKE] Miss Chidori
doesn't belong to Mithril.

361
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,541
Her safety should take priority.
But when we start fighting,

362
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,875
will the Captain be able
to run somewhere safe?

363
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:24,166
With her athletic skills,
if she isn't released first,

364
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,250
I suspect she won't have
much chance of surviving.

365
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:32,000
No, it could be a disaster.

366
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,083
[SOUSUKE]
Chidori.

367
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,250
Hurry up. What's takin' so long?

368
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,541
Send over the
causcasian woman first,

369
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,916
and send the Japanese second.

370
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,333
[KANAME, TELETHA gasp]

371
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,541
Miss Chidori seems to
be in better shape

372
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:02,333
than Miss Testarossa who...
Well, how should I put it...

373
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,833
Just be quiet.

374
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,833
[SOUSUKE]
Captain, stay behind me.

375
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,625
This is humiliating,
Sergeant Sagara.

376
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,125
Did you not even stop to think

377
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,541
I might be prepared for
this type of situation?

378
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,333
Censure me later.

379
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,000
Now, let him walk over.

380
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,166
They set up snipers.
When I say the word,

381
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,166
start making a dash
for the school building.

382
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,250
So you're telling me to hide
all trembling and helpless?

383
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,625
[SOUSUKE] If you don't,
you're putting yourself at risk.

384
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,083
[TELETHA]
I can't risk civilian lives.

385
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,500
[SOUSUKE]
Captain!

386
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,291
[SOUSUKE]
Now!

387
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,458
[TERRORIST C grunts]

388
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:04,791
[TERRORIST C groans]

389
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,333
[TERRORISTS]
Huh?

390
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,750
Kaname, let's go!

391
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,166
[KANAME] Look, you, I'm not
letting you get away!

392
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,500
Stop, Kaname! We need
to move out, now!

393
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,458
I'll get her!

394
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,208
Captain, get back!

395
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,666
Break it up! We're escaping!

396
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,708
Why'd you come back?
You should be gone already!

397
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,000
[KANAME, TELETHA gasp]

398
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,791
I'm gonna guess he's dead.

399
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:48,291
Don't bother crying out.
You'll be joining him.

400
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,708
[TAKUMA] No, wait!
You shouldn't kill her.

401
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,958
What do you mean?

402
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:55,958
Because she's...
No, well, nevermind.

403
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:59,041
That's right, we secured 'em.

404
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,083
What's that? Don't shoot?

405
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,250
Yeah, I got it.

406
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,583
Seina gave us orders
not to kill 'em.

407
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:06,916
We're taking 'em with us.

408
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,625
[sighs]

409
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,791
[KANAME]
Sousuke...

410
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,458
[KANAME]
He couldn't die that easily.

411
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:02,083
I'm sure he'll
come to rescue us.

412
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,333
We just need to hang
in there until he does.

413
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,333
Huh? What the heck
is that huge AS?!

414
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:11,166
Next Full Metal Panic: Episode
11, "Behemoth Awakening."

415
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,541
Hurry, Sousuke!

416
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:15,083
[SOUSUKE]
Next stop, the Odaiba district.
