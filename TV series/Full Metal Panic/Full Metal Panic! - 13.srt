00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,416
[MARDUKAS] The visible fatigue
on the metal of the

2
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,166
variable torque screw
is more than we expected.

3
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,541
Our hopes tend to err on
the side of disappointment.

4
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,625
However, I think that
Tuahar de Danaan

5
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:17,000
is doing better than we
expected, all thing considered.

[sighs]

9
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,208
Huh?

10
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,000
[MELISSA]
Yo! Welcome back.

11
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,666
Thought I'd drop in for a visit.

12
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,875
No wonder this place smells
like cigarette smoke.

13
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,083
[MELISSA]
Hm?

14
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:59,125
I've been using the
ventilator, you know.

15
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,875
[TELETHA]
I wonder what the cleaning lady,

16
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,000
who loves to gossip, will have
to say when she sees this mess.

17
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,291
[MELISSA]
Hm?

18
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,708
If word gets out,
people might start thinking

19
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,875
I drink and smoke
like a cheap bar girl

20
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,416
and I'd rather die than
have that happen to me.

21
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,375
Oh, so you're saying
I'm a cheap bar girl?

22
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,541
Is that it?

23
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,291
Well, who else does
that sort of thing?

24
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,083
Heh. So it's a fair
assumption that

25
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,583
in high-ranking little
Miss Testarossa world,

26
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,416
chicks who like to light up
and lit are all bitches.

27
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,833
Is that right?

28
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,708
Could you please stop
talking like that, Melissa?

29
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,791
You sound like a
B-movie gangster.

30
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,041
[MELISSA]
Well, if that's true,

31
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,458
then I guess that makes
you big bad crime boss.

32
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,583
That's really hurts, you know.

33
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,375
I try hard everyday
to see that people

34
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,125
don't think of this
organization like that,

35
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,416
but the way lower-level
people like behave...

36
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,250
What's that? I'm lower-level?

37
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,666
How can you even
think such a thing,

38
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,375
let alone say it?

39
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,833
I'm talking about your
irresponsible attitude.

40
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,791
I wish you would
remember who you are!

41
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,833
Oh, look at you.

42
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,458
I like to hide underwater

43
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,791
and sit in my chair,
giving orders...

44
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,208
[TELETHA]
You're way out of line!

45
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,583
You'll never know
what my job is like!

46
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:21,791
It must be hard on you imagining

47
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,958
what kind of
responsibility I have,

48
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,333
but I shouldn't be
surprised, coming from

49
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,083
an ex-marine with
muscles for brains.

50
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,708
[MELISSA] Ugh! Why don't
you put your money

51
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,208
where your mouth is

52
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,791
and stand in front of the
bullet sometime, huh, Captain?

53
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh, so relying on a
high-performance M9

54
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,291
makes you a battle
hardened hero?

55
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,958
Yeah! And just what do
you know about the AS?

56
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,708
You, who can't even pilot one?

57
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,375
Oh, I can pilot one.

58
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,958
I simply choose not to.

59
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,333
Aw, is that right, sweetie?

60
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,541
Yes, that's right,

61
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,875
and I can do it better
than you can, too.

62
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,708
A primitive savage who only
has her instincts to go on,

63
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,791
and who can't make the most
out of the specs. Hah!

64
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,875
Why you little...!

How 'bout you show me?

67
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,500
Huh?

68
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,083
Since you say you're
such a skilled pilot,

69
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,750
how 'bout you and me have
a match with the AS's?

70
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,041
If I lose the match,

71
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,458
I'll strip down and run
a lap around the base.

72
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:16,666
[TELETHA]
Naked?!

73
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,916
[MELISSA]
If I'm feeling nice,

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,291
I may allow you your underwear.

Ooh...

[TELETHA]
Fine. You're on.

78
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,833
Let's have ourselves
an AS match, Sgt. Major.

79
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,541
I'll be happy to correct
this concieted attitude

80
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,791
that has a hold of you.

81
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,833
If I lose, I'll do
whatever you say.

82
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,750
Even run a lap naked.

83
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,500
--[WOMAN gasps]
--[MAN] Whoa!

84
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,000

00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,250

P.S. Don't be a coward.

The loser must run a lap
around the base naked?!

Naked? Tessa, naked?

Uh... I guess it
could be Melissa, too.

[MELISSA]
What? Am I not good enough?

95
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,666
Ah!

96
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,208
Our little Captain
is challenging you?

97
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,666
Do you accept?

98
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,000
Of course I do.

99
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,500
You heard what the little
tart said to me, right?

100
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,333
[chuckles]

101
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,416
Well, you shouldn't.
She's pretty fragile.

102
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,083
Yes, it's a waste of your time.

103
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,500
Oh, no, no, no.

104
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,208
I am gonna tease
her to no end.

105
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,583
She's gonna cry, "I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, Melissa,"

106
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:10,708
and I'm gonna keep digging
my heel in. [chuckles]

107
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,041
I find her happiness
quite disturbing.

108
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:16,083
Hey, Marquis de Sade,
stop actin' like a little kid.

109
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,000
You should say the
same thing to her.

110
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,208
She's the real little
kid around here.

111

I'm sorry, who's a little kid?

Miss Captain, you've come to
grace us with your presense.

115
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,666
You may be thinking that
you can easily beat me,

116
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,750
but it's not going
to happen that way.

117
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:38,083
Heh. You really think you
can run a lap naked?

118
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,833
I can hardly wait.

119
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,791
Better ask yourself.

Well, shall we begin the
training session now?

131
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,708
[TELETHA]
Yes! I'm ready, coach!

132
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:29,000
[SOUSUKE] Right... Um, Captain?
Please don't call me coach.

133
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,708
But you are a coach.

134
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,166
I'll call you Mr. Sagara
if you prefer.

[SOUSUKE]
Thank you, ma'am.

I'd appreciate that.

Yes, sir, coach.
I mean, Mr. Sagara.

without the assistance
of a ladder,

not attempt this yourself.

That's roughly two stories.

So don't attempt it.

00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,333
I did it!

164
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,791
I'm in, Mr. Sagara!

[SOUSUKE sighs]

166
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:16,791
Very good, ma'am.

167
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,875
Now please take one
small step forward.

168
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,291
Yes, right away!

169
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,625
Here I go!

170
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,041
Ah!

171
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,708
Huh?!

172
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,958
Captain, do you copy?

173
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,291
Ah. Ah. [coughs]

174
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,708
Captain, listen,
you have to stop moving

175
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,166
and abort right now! Captain!

176
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,666
S-Someone help me!

177
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,708
[SOUSUKE]
Stay still!

178
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,500
I don't know how
to stop this thing!

179
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,083
How do I stop?!

180
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,958
Wait! Captain!

181
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,083
[KURZ] Heh, heh. Whew!
Someone's been hittin' the tap.

182
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,125
Huh?

183
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,125
Hey, barkeep, gimme the usual!

184
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:27,125
Me, too! I want another!

185
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,250
Maybe you should have
something else, miss.

186
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,833
[MELISSA] I can take it.
Hit me again, you old meiser.

187
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:35,166
Heh, heh. Try nursing this one.

188

Heh, heh!

189
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,583
Now, ya know,
our Tessa's out there

190
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,375
doin' some serious practice.

191
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,500
How stupid.

192
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,458
I feel sorry for poor Sousuke.

193
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,000
I'd say you're the
one bein' stupid.

194
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,666
All her life, whenever
someone told her

195
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,916
she couldn't do somethin',

196
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,833
she made it a point
to prove 'em wrong.

197
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,458
You went and told Tessa
she couldn't operate an AS

198
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,708
and now look what happened.

199
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,958
Get too cocky and you'll lose.

200
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,750
[MELISSA]
I know, dumbass.

201
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,250
Uh...

202
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,750
[MELISSA] I know her favorite
snack. The bugs she hates.

203
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,208
Her bra size.

204
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,791
I just couldn't
stand another minute

205
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,833
of her pretending to be
Miss Strong-and-independent.

206
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:12,750
Always putting on a brave face,
never knowing when to back down.

207
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,208
Are you serious?

208
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,125
[MELISSA] Oh yeah. It's so
totally pathetic, you know?

209
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,541
She thinks she can
change the world

210
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,291
with her sub and giant robots.

211
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,833
She's like a hyper
active little kid.

212
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,916
[KURZ] What about you
when you were her age?

213
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,541
[chuckles] I think I was
a lot stupider than she is.

214
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,833
[chuckles]

215
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,208
What's so funny?

216
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,000
[KURZ]
So, is that the honest truth?

217
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:42,458
[MELISSA sighs]
I guess... maybe it's true.

218
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:47,083
I may very well be the victim
of my own inferiority complex.

219
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:59,541
I suppose you're also thinking
that I can't win, Mr. Sagara?

220
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,041
No. That's not true... uh...

221
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,833
It's fine. I'll be okay.

222
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,166
Thank you for your kind
words, but I'm not stupid,

223
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,875
and I'm pretty sure
that I know what goes

224
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,791
into fighting
a battle, all right?

225
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,666
So you're planning on
winning this engagement?

226
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,000
[TELETHA]
Mh-mm. The other reason

227
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,625
I asked you to be my coach,

228
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:18,250
Mr. Sagara, is that I needed
a field expert's opinion.

229
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,500
Y'see, this area doesn't
have good visibilty

230
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,666
because of the think bushes.

231
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,875
The soil is very soft over here.

232
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,583
You see, given the
weight of the M9...

233
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,375
[SOUSUKE]
Huh...

234
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,625
[TELETHA]
So, what do you think?

235
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,166
It sounds like a good plan.

236
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,625
You think so? I'm so glad.

237
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,041
It was worth taking
the extra time.

238
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,708
[SOUSUKE] You may wanna
change the direcion here

239
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,916
to point this way,

240
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,166
taking the time of day
into consideration.

241
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,000
You'd be against the light.

242
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,041
[TELETHA]
I see.

243
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,250
But, no matter which
way you choose,

244
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,625
you're only going to
have one shot at it.

245
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,458
If it doesn't work
after that one try,

246
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,541
I'll give up.

247
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,791
I'll simply have to
surprise Melissa.

248
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,000
Surprise her? You're serious?

249
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,083
Yeah. If I can just do that,

250
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,916
running a lap around the
base naked is nothing.

Don't you think so?

252
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:15,958

Yeah, what?

256
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,416
You have read about
Musashi Miyamoto, right?

257
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,208
[MELISSA]
Huh?

258
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,375
Is it a famous battleship?

Uh... Yeah, nevermind.

A gas turbine engine?

She's using an M6.

264
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,250
Now I get it.

265
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,833
She'd rather have easy handling

266
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,166
than state-of-the-art
specs, huh?

267
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,583
You know, I've been
waiting for a while now.

I'm sorry.

to pull any punches.

Wait, no way!

284

It wasn't a direct hit.

285
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,958
You hit the tree
in front of her.

286

What are you talking about?

287
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,458
A real bullet would've ripped
right through that tree.

288
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,791
Unfortunately, you're not
shooting real bullets this time,

00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,208
you're shooting paint.

You're lucky, Mao.

If it had been a real bullet,

the debry would have
damaged your sensors.

Fine. We'll play by your rules.

So all I have to do
is make a direct hit?

That's affirmative.

00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,833
Calm down, and keep moving.

322
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,166
Don't stay in one spot.

323
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,875
I-I know that, but I...

324
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,416
You'll be fine. I know you
can do it, Madam Captain.

325
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,125
I guarantee it.

326
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,958
[SOUSUKE]
I guarantee it.

327
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,250
Okay!

328
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,625
The M6 is pretty fast.

329
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,083
Doesn't matter though.

330
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,208
So...

331
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,958
...let's finish this.

332
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,041
[MELISSA gasps]

333
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,416
[MELISSA]
ECS?!

334
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,666
[MELISSA] No reaction.
What does that mean?

335
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,333
Very impressive move,
and yet... y'know...

336
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,958
[MELISSA] ...I sttill feel
sorry for the poor thing.

337
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,208
Sayonara.

338
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,750
[M9 A.I.]
Alpha 1 has been lost.

339
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,541

340
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:49,666
[gasps]

341
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,625
[TELETHA]
Please hit it!

342
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:16,458
[pants]

343
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:29,708
[MELISSA] I lost. Oh yeah,
she totally wiped me out,

344
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,250
but I won't complain that
it's not fair to set a trap,

345
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,000
or that the judge
was on her side,

346
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,333
or that everybody
was supporting Tessa.

347
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,208
And I'm not gonna bitch about
how unfortunate and lonely I am.

348
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,833
Oh no, I'm saying
nothing of the sort,

349
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,833
and I won't say how
if it was a real battle,

350
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,333
I would've won.

351
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,625
You won't hear me insisting
like some ungracious loser.

352
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,416
Sounds to me like you got
a whole lotta complaints.

353
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,541
Negligence is the worst enemy.

354
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:58,333
[MELISSA] Yeah, yeah. There's no
excuse for ignorance, is there?

355
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,333
[MELISSA sighs]
God, what was I doing?

356
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:05,625
I'm so stupid. Aw, man.

357
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,416
Melissa...

358
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,500
I'm sorry I said all
those terrible things.

359
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:37,916
[sobs]

360
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,333
I need to thank your people
for their work, Lt. Commander.

361
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:50,958
[TELETHA sobbing]

362
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,416
[TELETHA] I'm sorry I did
such a stupid thing.

363
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,541
Nah, it's a good thing I lost.

364
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,125
It's natural that the
Captain should win,

365
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,791
but enough talk,
it's over with, okay?

366
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,666
Yeah, I've had more
than enough of that AS.

367
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,500
Excuse me. Uh, girls?

368
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:10,041
What happened to running a
lap around the base naked?

369
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,125
[BOTH]
Scumbag.

370
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:00,958
[SOUSUKE] The Self-Defense
Force has set up

371
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:02,375
an extreme AS challenge:

372
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:05,916
for pride, for love,
and because I couldn't say no.

373
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,333
Next Full Metal Panic,
Episode 14:

"Is Narashino Burning?"

375
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:12,541
The keyword for victory
is graded radish.

376

[TELETHA]
You're kidding, right?
