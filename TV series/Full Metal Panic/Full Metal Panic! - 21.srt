[RADIO A] Control of Berilabu
Island is almost complete.

2
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,083
We've got some
survivors still resisting,

3
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,500
but that should be
suppressed very soon.

4
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,791
[RADIO B] At last count,
we had 17 POWs.

5
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,958
All the hostages
detained inside the base

6
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,666
have been rescued.

[RADIO C] Sergeant Major Melissa
Mao is severely wounded.

9
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,875
Repeat: Sergeant Major Mao
is severely wounded.

10
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,541
[KURZ] Well, this kinda
thing happens.

11
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,541
[SOUSUKE]
Kurz. Lian.

12
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,125
I'm sure she'll be okay.

13
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,833
C'mon Sousuke. I'm sure you know
how tough our Melissa is, right?

[gasps]

15
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,666
Don't worry, son.
You gave you best out there.

16
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,166
Lieutenant, but I...

17
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,541
[GAURON]
Yo, Ivan. Long time no see.

18
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,375
What are you planning, Gauron?

19
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,000
'Fraid I don't know what
you're talking about.

20
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:40,458
Do not expect my forgiveness,
or any kind of deal from me.

21
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,958
I will wipe you from this Earth
once I have your confession.

22
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,250
Remember that.

23
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,833
Oh, How scary.

24
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,041
Take this thing away.

25
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,875
[MCALLEN]
Sir!

26
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,500
[KALININ]
Take off in five minutes.

27
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,375
I need to negotiate
with the US military.

28
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,041
[MCALLEN]
Yes, sir.

29
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,666
[GAURON]
Hmph.

30
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,916
[KALININ] I know he wouldn't
do something like this

31
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,833
for no reason at all.

32
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,500
He seems dissolute
and given up to hedonism,

33
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,416
but he's a professional.

34
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,375
He continually secures his
safety through careful planning.

35
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:36,375
There's something
suspicious about all this.

36
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,500
[MCALLEN] Don't you think
it smacks of a diversion?

37
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,500
While he has our
attention focused on him,

38
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,125
the main contingent
attacks somewhere else.

39
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,541
[KALININ]
It's possible.

40
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,458
I already said as much
to headquarters though.

41
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,625
[KALININ] Ask Captain Testarossa
for her orders regarding Venom.

42
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,250
I leave his personal
treatment to you.

43
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,375
Keep him isolated until
the medical check is complete.

44
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,166
Once you know
he has no problems,

45
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,333
you may ignore any
new health issues.

46
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,208
[MCALLEN]
Even if he gets seriously ill?

47
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:10,666
Yes, even if you know without a
doubt that he isn't pretending.

48
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,500
You must think of him as a
highly intelligent savage beast.

49
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,250
I understand, sir.

Hurry and admit the injured.

52
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:33,083
We're heading back to
Barildabu as soon as we tank up.

Move it! The next one's coming.

She'll be fine. Girl's just
got a little concussion

57
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,291
and a ribcage fracture.

58
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,250
You're sure?
Is she gonna make it?

59
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,125
I don't think Death's
gonna be knocking down

60
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,833
any doors to get close
to that spitfire.

62
00:05:58,666 --> 00:05:59,791
Huh?

00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,291
Hey, Sousuke.

00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,916
Hey... Why aren't you
back with your people?

65
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,708
[SOUSUKE]
I made a mistake.

66
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,083
I'm too ashamed to see them.

67
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,000
What happened? Did anybody die?

68
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,208
No...

69
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,083
Then it's okay, right?

70
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,750
Miss Mao doesn't look all
that bad and the doctor said--

71
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,333
You have no idea!

72
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:48,833
What? I-I'm sorry...
I'm not trying to be rude.

73
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,000
One more mistake

74
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,458
and I could have
easily gotten her killed.

75
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,833
Me and that stupid AS.

76
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,583
Huh?

77
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,958
I-I couldn't... I couldn't
start the Lambda Driver.

78
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:01,750
Now, this enhancing
mentality and images,

79
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,416
I don't get it!

80
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,333
Something that unstable
is not a weapon!

81
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,041
It's a spell!

82
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:11,250
Whoever came up with it
is the worst engineer!

83
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,083
Why don't you take a rest?

84
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,708
You must be totally exhausted.

85
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,791
First, Helmajistan. Now, this.

86
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,208
Didn't you have a
tough time over there?

87
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,500
Look, Kurz told me about it.

88
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,125
He was worried about you, too.

89
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,625
I'm not tired, so don't worry.

90
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,250
You're not even acting
like yourself though.

91
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,125
What do you know about me?!

92
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,541
[gasps]

93
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,375
How can you sit there and
say I'm not being myself?

94
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm a mercenary.

95
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,750
I should've been
doing regular work

96
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,291
and using standard
issue equipment.

97
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,916
But ever since
the airline hijacking,

98
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,666
I've run into
nothing but bad luck.

99
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,333
Gauron, that AS,
Helmajistan, guarding you...

100
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,625
One problem after another.

101
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,291
Now, look here!

102
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,083
I didn't ask to have
someone guarding me 24/7!

103
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,750
So if it's too much trouble,

104
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,833
then you shuld just
quit and forget it!

105
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:06,916
I can't quit!

106
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,708
I'm the only one
who's fit for this duty!

107
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,541
I'm your "duty?" What the
hell does that mean?

108
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,666
[SOUSUKE] I think you're
the one who's tired.

109
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,416
I'm not tired.

110
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,958
I've been worried to
death about you, Sousuke!

111
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,375
Can't you see?

112
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,500
Fine, I get it, okay?

113
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:22,708
I get the point.

114
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,041
Why don't you go back
to your room now?

115
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:38,708
Did you see her?

116
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,333
Yeah, I saw her.

117
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,833
[KURZ]
Sousuke?

118
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,666
[grunts]

119
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,041
Kurz, c'mon. Stop it!

120
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,166
Let go!

121
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,500
What the hell was that for?

122
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,541
I overheard you, so
I thought I'd drop in

123
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,791
and help your head stop
swelling from this idea

124
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,125
you've got about being
a hero. That's what.

125
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,916
I think I'm a hero?

126
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,625
[KURZ] Just because you can't
be perfect 100% of the time,

127
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,958
you get all sulky and
take it out on a woman!

128
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,375
You know, it's people like you

129
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,875
who become violent
husbands and cause trouble

130
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,083
for everyone around!
Do you hear me?!

131
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,166
That's it. Kurz has
gone off the deep end.

132
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,750
I did not take it out on her.

133
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,625
[KURZ]
Then what do you call it?

134
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,083
Why did you make
her cry, asshole?

135
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,291
Think real hard about
what you said to her.

136
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,541
I made her cry?

137
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,958
Hmph! I understand
it bothers you,

138
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,833
but it does happen.

139
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:36,541
Of course, you know that,
being such a pro.

140
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,833
You think you're fighting
on your own here?!

141
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,125
Don't flatter yourself.

142
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,750
[TELETHA]
It's not broken? Venom?

143
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,958
Right. The armor and the
ECS lens on the shoulder

144
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:58,083
have received some damage,
but there's nothing else.

145
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,500
There's no danger of it
starting by itself either.

146
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,000
It has a self-destruct system,

147
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:06,000
but that won't start till
someone physically touches it.

148
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,458
Captain?

149
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,666
Oh!

150
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,041
Yes, thank you very much
for your hard work.

151
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,375
We'll analyze Venom
back at the base.

152
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,833
Understood, Captain.

153
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,583
Mr. Mardukas.

154
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,750
Yes, Madam Captain?

155
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,625
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

156
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,958
That toybox may
be passing within

157
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:43,708
a 100 kilometers of you and
your crew in the next 12 hours.

158
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,291
Once you find it,

159
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:50,291
collect as much vital
data on it as you can.

160

do you think
maybe headquarters

that much from us?

[CAPTAIN SAILOR]
When I was a kid, I was captain

00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,333
of a boy's baseball team
called the Oklahoma Sailors.

Huh?

One of our teammates was

00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:17,125
this hopeless half-pint
we all called Nobby.

171
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,416
I put him in right
field, eigth at bat,

172
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,041
gave him the cold shoulder,
and when he made an error,

173
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:25,208
I made him pull his pants
down in front of Kathy.

Ever since I got this
situation dumped on me,

I think I'm starting to see

177
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:35,916
how Nobby must have felt
sitting in right field.

178

Well, that was a sure long
and pointless anecdote.

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,375
[SOLDIERS whispering]

323
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,333
[DANA]
Welcome, Captain Gauron.

324
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,166
Please give me your order.

325
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,791
Thanks, Dana.
Don't mind if I do.

326
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,958
It can't be. There's no way.

327
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,791
How about we start
with an evacuation drill?

328
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,041
[DANA]
Drill commencing.

329
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:43,041
[alarms blaring]

330
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,958
[DANA] Number two engine
room is on fire.

331
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,791
All crew, please evacuate
to the main hanger

332
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,625
at the front of the submarine.

333
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,875
This is a drill.

334
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,250
[SOLDIERS]
I was taking a nap.

335
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,250
[SOLDIERS]
Where's the fire?

336
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,375
[SOLDIERS]
Oh, no. C'mon! C'mon!

337
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,166
Captain's bustin'
our balls again.

338
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,833
[alarms blaring]

339
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,166
[OFFICER]
No! The door is closing!

340
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,666
Miss Chidori may
still be back there

341
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,958
and she's a civillian.

342
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,541
Now please let me
go and find her.

343
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,041
I can't let you do that.

344
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,333
All the people beyond this
point are supposed to be dead.

345
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,125
[SOUSUKE]
Yes, but--

346
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,583
No, buts! That's an order!

347
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,625
[sighs] I understand, sir.

348
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,208
[OFFICER]
Hey you!

349
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,541
[grunts]

350
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:27,750
[gasps]

351
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,166
Are ya sure you wanna be here?

352
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,208
cause you just
ignored an order.

353
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,750
Okay, so what are
you doing here then?

354
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,166
The long and short of it is:

355
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,291
I'm not real fond
of group activities.

356
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,625
I thought somebody else
might ditch the drill,

357
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:42,000
but I never figured it would
be you, Sergeant Somber.

358
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,333
My gut tells me that something
bad is happening here.

359
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,291
Mine, too. Shall we
check it out?

360
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,708
Affirmative.

361
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,250
[DANA]
Main bulkhead closure complete.

362
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,166
The front of the submarine

363
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,375
has now been sealed
off from the rear.

364
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,875
Never give up.

365
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:01,041
[TELETHA] We're in the
worst possible situation.

366
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,125
Gauron has taken
over the submarine.

367
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,083
The crews' lives are
ready to flicker out

368
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,208
like a candle in the wind.

369
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,833
Next Full Metal Panic,
Episode 22:

370
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,000
"Jack-in-the-Box."

371
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,000
Miss Kaname, you're
our last resort!

372
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,833
Please hurry!
