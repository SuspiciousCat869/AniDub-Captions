Takuma Kugayama,
right? Home stay?

3
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,750
No? I was traveling
as a student.

00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,333
[CUSTOMS OFFICER]
Hm... On your own?

00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:17,458

Yes.

[TAKUMA]
Your tie is crooked.

00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,208
[CUSTOMS OFFICER] Weren't your
parents worried about you?

9
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:28,333
[TAKUMA] Not really.
They trust me enough.

10
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,666
[TAKUMA]
It's none of your business.

11
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,833
Fix your damn tie!

12
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,041
[CUSTOMS OFFICER]
You're free to go.

13
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,041
Excuse me?

14
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,625
I said that you're
free to go now.

15

[TAKUMA]
Hurry up and fix your tie!

16
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,375
I can't take it anymore.

17
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,458
W-What did you say
about your tie?

18

Huh? What the heck are
you talkin' about, kid?

[TAKUMA] Y-You think
I'm gonna forgive you?

Nine armored motor cars
and three tanks.

Listen up. Urzu 7
and I will tackle

the amored vehicles located
in blocks B and C.

Urzu 6, keep an eye out
for grounds troops.

Don't start trouble.

first battle after sick leave.

Don't ya think I
deserve a little treat?

[MELISSA]
Glad you still have an appetite,

34

Urzu 7. The coast is clear.

Okay!

You can't escape! Surrender now!

[TELETHA]
It was a miss?

43
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,625
[MELISSA]
Yes, Captain. At this point,

44
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:33,208
there's no sign of the
terrorist group called A21.

45
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,666
[TELETHA]
I see...

46
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,666
I'm sorry that I made you
waste your time, Sgt. Major.

47
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,583
[MELISSA] Don't worry, ma'am.
It's not your fault.

48
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,458
Yes, well, please return
to base as planned.

49
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,458
I'll be waiting.

These things happen.

[TELETHA] This is a problem
I can't put off like that.

53
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,875
This terrorist group
we know as A21.

54
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:59,291
They have a Soviet-made AS in
their possession, don't they?

Line G1, Lt. Commander Kalinin.

56

Connect him.

00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,083
[KALININ]
Good morning, Captain.

58
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,000
I received a report
stating that one of

59
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:13,208
A21's members was arrested
earlier today at Narita Airport.

60
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,083
Are you positive?

61
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,250
[KALININ]
Yes.

62
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,666
What's more, the boy
they arrested

63
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,083
seems to be exhibiting
the same reaction.

64
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,625
Which means...?

65
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,166
[KALININ] Well, Captain, it
means that it's possible the boy

66
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,541
has the capacity to operate
the Lambda Driver.

67
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,250
[KURZ]
Not a single Japanese person.

68
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,333
Another false lead, huh? Dammit.

69
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,708
[MELISSA] Well, it's not like
we can help it, now is it?

70
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,500
Let's just go wait
at the pickup point.

--[SOUSUKE] Uh-oh.
--[MELISSA, KURZ] Huh?

What's wrong, Sousuke?

73
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,500
[SOUSUKE]
I completely forgot.

74
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,083
[KURZ]
Yeah? Forgot what?

75
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,625
Sousuke, don't tell
me you forgot

76
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,791
something important
like the radio codes?

77

[SOUSUKE]
No.

78
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,000
I forgot an appointment
to meet someone.

00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,125
It was at 1900 hours yesterday.

00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,416
Ha, ha.

83
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,916
I need help with my,
uh, Japanese history.

84
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:08,416
[UMPIRE] Strike three and
the batter is outta there.

That was awesome.

88
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,875
Three strike outs in a row.

89
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,250
Yeah, it was a total
piece of cake.

But, ya know, flaunting your
softball skills in PE class?

91

Don't you think
it's a little much?

[KYOKO] Are you having any
trouble with Sousuke?

94
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,125
You said you were
gonna help Sousuke

95
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,000
with some of his
classwork, right?

96
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,458
So what, did he do
something wrong again?

97
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,958
No, no, no. He didn't
do anything.

98
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,458
How could he? I mean,

99
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,583
he didn't show up
for the appointment.

100
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:46,500
No, nothing. [forced laughter]

S-Sousuke?

Good. I'm only slightly
tardy for second period.

114
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,541
It was worth flying
all the way back

115
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,083
from the South China Sea.

116

Um, regarding our
appointment yesterday,

120
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,125
are you angry with me?

121
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,416
[growls] No! I'm not
angry at you.

122
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,458
Not in the least. I mean,
why should I be angry?

123
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,916
Well, that's good to hear.

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,500
I had some important
business to attend to,

00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,125
and I completely
forgot about it.

Hey, Sousuke! Why don't
you come over?

What do you want?

The stars are cleverly
concealed flash bangs

162
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,458

you can throw them at your
enemies in self-defense.

164

Very effective,
since most enemies

at a girl's earrings.

[TELETHA] What's the
security situation here?

175
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,416
[KALININ]
Two platoons. That is to say,

176
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,291
60 soldiers on guard 24/7.

177

This is a facility that

The general public isn't
aware of it's existence.

[TELETHA]
What happened?

182
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,666
[KALININ] He jumped on
an officer in Narita

183
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,458
and nearly choked
a man to death.

184
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,750
He did?

185
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,916
[KALININ]
Yes.

186
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,500
Even after they
had him pinned down,

187
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,750
he was still extremely agitated.

188
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:17,666
They performed a drug test and
found "TI-971" in his blood.

189
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,375
And that's why they
had me called in, right?

190
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,666
Correct, the Japanese government
took him into custody,

191
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,500
and we had no other
choice but to ask you,

192
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,958
Madam Captain, to come in
and observe him.

193
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,041
You're the only one who
can judge whether he,

00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,250
Takuma Kugayama,
has been reformed

And whether or not the so-called
treatment was a success.

If we want to perform a
thorough test on the subject,

00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,416
we would need to measure
his response levels

with a portable NILS.

However, he's probably
gone over the edge.

00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,291
Do you think so?

321
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,416
[TELETHA] The picture Melissa
painted fits you to a tee.

322
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,958
Huh?

323
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,916
Come to think of it,

324
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,458
we've never talked personally
like this before, have we?

325
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,750
Did you know?

326
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,666
I'm actually the same age
as you are, Sagara.

327
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,958
Yes, I'm well aware of
our common ages, Captain.

328
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,791
If we walked hand in hand,

329
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,416
people might think we're
boyfriend and girlfriend.

330
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Huh?

331
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,000
Yes, ma'am, I'm quite
honored you think so.

332
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,916
Please, you can relax when
we're talking like this.

333
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,083
I don't know what to do

334
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,208
if you're acting all
stiff and military.

335
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,958
Roger. I'll do my best, ma'am.

336
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,708
Sousuke, I'm not
giving you an order.

337
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,375
Please think of it
as a friend's request.

338
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,750
Yes, if that's your order,
then I will.

339
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,916
Hey, would you mind it,
if I used your bathroom?

340
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,583
[gasps] I-I have to do my job.

341
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,208
Urzu 7 here with an
urgent communication.

342
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,125
So, is the prisoner hungry?

343
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,333
[TAKUMA]
No.

344
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,500
I guess you understand
the language then.

345
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:43,666
Well of course, I do,
Mr. Sousuke Sagara.

346
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,250
[doorbell chimes]

347
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:54,333
[door clicks]

348
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,041
Ah--!

349
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,041
Kaname, what are you...?

350
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,833
[KANAME] Um... About that
incident earlier today...

351
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:04,208
I can be a little...
you know, stubborn sometimes.

352
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:09,333
So, how do I say this...

353
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,541
I'm sorry.

354
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,166
[gasps]

355
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,666
No, I'm the one who's always
been causing trouble for you.

356
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,166
If you're sorry about it,
then where do I stand?

357
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,166
Would you... forgive me?

358
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,000
[SOUSUKE] There's nothing
that needs forgiving.

359
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,250
It was my fault.

360
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,750
Really? Thank you!

361
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,916
Uh, I still have some
leftovers from yesterday.

362
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,541
I-I brought them
with me. Are ya hungry?

363
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:32,708
If you let me
use your kitchen,

364
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,333
I'll heat them up for you.

365
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,208
Actually...

366
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,875
Oh, did you already eat?

367
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,833
[SOUSUKE]
No, I haven't, but...

368
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,666
Then, why don't we
just eat together.

369
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,833
You don't mind, do you?

370
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,708
No, I appreciate your kindness,
but you see, the thing is...

371
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,083
Huh?

372
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,375
I'm in a rather complicated
situation at the moment.

373
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:53,250
This is a problem that could
take some time explaining.

374
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,500
How can I put this...

375
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,916
I'm not exactly sure
you'd understand

376
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,666
the full extent of
what's going on.

377
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,458
What are you talking about?

378
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,333
[growls]

379
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,416
[TELETHA]
Mr. Sagara...

380
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,958
Do you have a spare T-shirt
or something I could...?

381
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,125
Oh!

382
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:00,208
[TELETHA] Being with
Mr. Sagara makes me happy

383
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,708
and kinda of giddy
at the same time.

384
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:06,083
Oh, my gosh! What am I saying
at a time like this?

385
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:10,541
Next Full Metal Panic:
Episode 10, "Run, Run, Run."

386
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,291
Am I a burden?

387
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,125
[SOUSUKE]
It's not a problem, Captain.
