I care about him.

shake this feeling...

we'll never be able to escape.

I've had enough of this.

Let's just dump it
off the cliff.

No, we can go down the slope.

[SOUSUKE]
Once we get down there,

38
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,166
we'll be in hilly terrain.

39
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,500
It'll give us the
advantage of cover.

40

And just how do you
know that for sure?

41
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,500

I used to fight in this land.

had the latest model AS's,

Didn't we have a surgery kit?

00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:23,541
You still gotta pay me $300
from that poke game we played.

58
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,916
[SOUSUKE] We've got a heavy

A burden?

What did you say?

00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,166
Are you tellin' us we should
leave Batist behind?

62
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,083
No, I was talking
about the warhead.

[ANDY]

I'm sorry if I wasn't clear.

65
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,708
If you have time to argue,

66
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,500
why don't you check the
shock absorbers on the M9s?

67
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,958
Did you ring up HQ?

68
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,041
Our long distance communications
are malfunctioning.

69
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,875
Then let's hide the
trailer behind the rocks,

70
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,458
and find the nearest town.

71
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,708
They've gotta have a
telephone there, right?

72
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,125
I have an objection.

00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,875
Ugh! Not you again!

74
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,541
It takes 3 days to reach
the nearest town.

75
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,833
The enemy is more likely

76
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,166
to find the abandoned
warhead in the meantime.

77
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,541
I propose we launch
a counterattack.

78
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,125
A counterattack?
You must be kidding.

79
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,750
We only have four AS's
left in our squad.

80
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,458
I'm not much for
fightin' losin' battles.

81
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,833
We'll have a better
chance of winning.

00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,291
This is our unit's mission,
okay, Sergeant?

83
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,458
And you have no right
to give us orders.

was the right one.

If only we had listened
to him, then...

better than we do.

What is it?

area is like my back yard.

older than me.

We worked well together.

Why haven't we caught them yet?

That goddammed warhead
is our merchandise.

There's no excuse for
it to have been stolen.

Can't we do anything?

163
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,250
I don't wanna lose
another squad member.

164
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,583
[BATIST groans]

165
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,166
We may be able to pick up
an emergenc surgical kit.

166
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,250
[gasps]

167
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,500
[ANDY]
What? Is there a village nearby?

168
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,625
[SOUSUKE]
No.

169
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,041
It's a remote camp
we used to stay at.

170
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,041
But we need to take a detuor,

171
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,500
which might put us
out in the open.

172
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,125
[GAURON]
They changed direction?

173
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,458
That's right.

174
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,125
I thought they were going
over the mountain range

175
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,458
and straight to the town.

176
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,166
[ZAIED]
Now they're heading this way.

177
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,125
Taking the scenic route, huh?

178
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,708
Do you think they're
tryin' to confuse us?

179
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:07,958
[ZAIED] No. It's more likely
that Kashim is headinng...

180
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,375
...here.

181
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,708
[BATIST groans]

182
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,458
Sergeant! Have you found
the surgery kit yet?

183
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,833
[SOUSUKE]
No, not yet.

184
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,208
Holy shit, this
place looks terrible.

185
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,916
Hey, Sagara, you really
expect us to believe

186
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,250
you used to live here?

187
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,875
Affirmative.

188
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,083
Looks like somebody...
lost a battle.

189
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,291
[SOUSUKE]
Affirmative.

190
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,750
[gasps]

191
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:13,708
Found it.

192
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,458
Oh! All right!

193
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,125
[SOUSUKE]
It's all vaccuum-packed,

194
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,041
but we should still
sterilize everything.

195
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,250
Jackson, give me the flashlight.

196
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,333
Andy, go boil some water.

197
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,625
Okay.

198
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,041
And I'll go keep watch outside.

199
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,333
So is it finished?

200
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,958
Yes, but we shouldn't move
him until his fever's down.

201
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,708
Andy and Jackson are
checking if there

202
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:08,125
are any tools or bullets left
that we can make use of.

203
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,833
Is it a good idea for us
to stay here hiding?

204
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,750
No, we'd better
assume our enemies

205
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,375
will discover this place
sooner or later.

206
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,166
Unfortunately, Gauron also
knows about this hideout.

207
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,833
[GRAY]
He knows?

208
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,875
The people who attacked
our unit back then--

209
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,708
Gauron was also fighting
on their side.

210
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,166
[SOUSUKE]
It was only by coincidence

211
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,041
that I was away from the
camp on reconnaissance.

212
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,333
I guess I've been pretty lucky.

213
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,833
Just one single mistake,

214
00:15:56,916 --> 00:16:00,333
and I'm sure my destiny would've
been the same as Zaied's.

215
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,333
[GRAY]
I'm from Eastern Europe.

216
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:16,083
As you may know, that area
is rife with civil war.

217
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,875
I joined the resistance movement

218
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,250
and started to operate an AS.

219
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,583
One day, our enemies
surrounded us.

220
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,166
We were supposed to
have reinforcements,

221
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,125
but they never came
until the end.

222
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,375
And that was it: the whole
unit had been abandoned.

223
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,916
It often happens.

224
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,625
I wandered around for a while,

225
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,000
and now I'm a mercenary
from Mithril.

226
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,708
All the other
soldiers in this unit

227
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:45,125
must have similar experiences
to mine, I suppose,

228
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,541
but of course, they
never talk about it.

229
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,833
Anyway, I was wondering
if you would stay

230
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,708
with our unit when this is over.

231
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,166
[gasps]

232
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,083
If I have to fill a vacancy,
I'd like a skilled pilot.

233
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,791
You've passed
the test, Sergeant.

234
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,166
Well, I...

235
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,125
[GRAY] You can give me an
answer when we get back.

236
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,125
Well, I hope you'll consider it.

237
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,833
[GRAY] A pretty awful
homecoming, isn't it, Sergeant?

238
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,291
A homecoming?

239
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,583
[GRAY] Oh, right. I guess
Japan is your homeland now.

240
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,000
Homeland?

241
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,916
[GRAY] Do you have someone
waiting for you in Japan?

242
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Uh, no...

243
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,083
Well, maybe yes, maybe no...

244
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,541
[GRAY]
Hm.

245
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,958
There's a six hour
time difference.

246
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,250
It must be nighttime there.

247
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,916
Miss Mao, thank you.

248
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,666
So do you really feel safer
when "he" guards you?

249
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,916
Oh, sorry if I gave
that impression.

250
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,666
Wow! It's pretty good.

251
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,000
[MELISSA] We'll be informed
once the mission is finished.

252
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:12,125
I'll let you know as soon
as I hear something.

253
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,666
Don't worry. He'll be back soon.

254
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,208
So why don't you think
about getting him

255
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,291
a welcome home present?

256
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,125
He'll probably be
coming back exhausted.

257
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,583
[KANAME]
Mm.

258
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,875
[SOUSUKE]
Gauron will most likely

259
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,958
follow his previous success
and take this path.

260
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,541
With Kashim, one would
expect him to think

261
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,458
we'd attack exactly the
same way we did last time.

262
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,833
If we counterattack directly,
we won't stand a chance.

263
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,333
So we'll set up an ambush.

264
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,750
They'll set up an ambush,

265
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,500
and shoot at us from there.

266
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,166
Kashim really has no
other viable options.

267
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,875
We should dig in
where we can shoot

268
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:15,958
but somewhere they
won't be able

269
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,958
to shoot back at us.

270
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,500
I propose...

271
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,333
[ZAIED]
Here.

272
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,291
Heh.

273
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,416
[GRAY]
Are you ready?

274
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,041
[SOUSUKE]
Affirmative.

275
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:55,666
Here we can shoot the
enemies as they come.

276
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,541
We may not be as good
as Kurz though.

277
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,708
[ANDY]
I don't like you, Sagara.

278
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,291
Even though you're a kid
and you're skillful as hell,

279
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,833
you're still a punk.

280
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,875
Real smartass, you know that?

281
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,708
Your kind pisses me off.

282
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,916
[SOUSUKE]
I see.

283
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,833
I'm savin' a punch for
you back at the base

284
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,500
so don't go and
get yourself killed.

285
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,833
I can't promise anything,
but I will try.

286
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,166
Heh. Motivation.

287
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,791
That's what I'm
talkin' about, son.

288
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,958
[chuckles]

289
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,166
[laughs]

290
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:41,250
[beeping]

291
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,625
[alarm beeping]

292
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,041
[GAUREN] Kashim, there's no
place for you to escape.

293
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,125
There are no reinforcements.

294
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:06,416
What can I say? Reality is
a harsh mistress.

295
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,250
Next Full Metal Panic,
Episode 17:

296
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,541
"The Wind Blows
at Home, Part 3."

297
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:14,208
No one's going home
alive, this time.
