I don't have any regrets.

Hey, Miss Chidori!

Oh, right, good morning.

00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:18,333
Wait, did you think about
what I said yesterday?

17
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,041
Said about what?

18
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,583
Come on. You know you want me
to be your main squeeze.

19
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:26,416
Oh, that. I'm sorry, but your
application has been rejected.

00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,125
Oh, don't say that, babe.

[SOUSUKE] That's it.
Consider yourself suspect.

00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,458
Good morning to
you too, Sousuke.

26
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,250
So who is this guy, Chidori?

27
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,708
Oh, that's Mr. Shirai
from class 2.

28
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,250
He's just a civilian,
so you can let him go.

00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,333
Are you sure?

30
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,541
Of course I am.

31
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,958
[SOUSUKE]
I'll let you go this time,

32
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,541
but if I catch you
doing this again,

33
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:55,541
I'll track down you and all your
relatives. Is that understood?

[KANAME sighs]

Jeez laweez, if you're
gonna interfere in my life,

36
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,625
you could be more
polite about it.

37
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,625
Maybe a little less
gung-ho approach.

serious just then.

Yeah, yeah. Thanks anyway.

Huh?

It's weird, I feel
like someone's been

watching me all day.

48
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,791
Someone watching you?
You mean like a boy?

49
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,916
Well, it's hard to explain, but
I can feel it in my shoulders

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,291
like someone's
digging into them.

Oh, I let him play
my dating sim,

97
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,291
because he was having a
tough time understanding

the dating environment
of Japanese teenagers.

stupid or something?

Um, Sousuke,
what did you just do?

She said she wanted to go
shopping for a swimsuit,

so I told her to go
do it by herself.

she got real angry.

to choose her swimsuit, okay?

111
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:11,625
I could advise her regarding

various types of
military apparel,

113
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,916
but I have no idea when it
comes to civilian clothes,

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,875
and that's why I refused.

on a compromise!

Chidori and the others go?

But nothing has happened
to me since then!

00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,833
and I really couldn't
care less about Shirai.

160
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,375
In any case, Sousuke Sagara,

161
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,250
you and I are going
on a date tomorrow!

162
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,500
Huh?

163
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,708
Is there some reason
we're all at my place?

164
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,583
We're gonna have an
over-night study session.

165
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,625
But I can't have a boy
staying at my house

166
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,500
because my daddy would kill me.

167
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,208
Satoru Shirai has made passes
not only at Chidori,

168
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,666
but many other girls as well.

169
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,750
And on top of that, he easily
carried out a rather

170
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,375
complicated and high-level
tactic to dump his own girl.

171
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,791
He's definitely not a person
to be underestimated.

172
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,250
[KANAME] Oh, whatever.
He's just fooling around.

173
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,125
And now, why exactly does
Sousuke have to date you?

174
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,208
I promised some of my
friends from junior high

175
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,041
that they'd get to meet
my boyfriend tomorrow,

176
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,583
which puts me
in a bit of a spot.

177
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,458
But I don't mind as long as
I can get through it

178
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,458
and save face.

179
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,750
Even though he is a little
on the scruffy side,

180
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,291
he is sorta handsome.

181
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,375
And since it was your fault
that Shirai broke up with me,

182
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,625
don't you think you should
at least do me this favor

183
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,083
to make up for it?

184
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,958
[KANAME] Ugh, you're
just being vindictive...

185
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,958
Very well. I accept your
order for a date, ma'am.

186
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,291
Uh, oh, no you don't!

187
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,250
What're you getting
all upset for?

188
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,666
It's not really any
of your business

189
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,291
what Sousuke does
in his spare time.

190
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,833
Th-That's true, but I--

191
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,250
I was unsuccessful at
today's love simulation,

192
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,833
and after a brief analysis,
I have concluded there is

193
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,208
but one reason:

194
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,041
I don't know the
game in real life.

195
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,166
Nowadays, wars are won by the
group with the most information.

196
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,958
Recon is crucial

197
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,500
[sighs]

198
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,833
I hope you know what you're
getting yourself into...

199
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,250
[MIZUKI]
All right then...

200
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,958
What brand of pants did
you buy most recently?

201
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,208
Uh... My basic equipment
is a combination of

202
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,666
Harry Hower's black suede
western shirt,

203
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,541
and a pair of black chino pants
to achieve low visibility

204
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,125
on active duty out in the field.

205
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,041
[MIZUKI] Okay... That last
bit was a little weird,

206
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,166
but it'll do.

207
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,208
I enjoy buying
expensive clothing.

208
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:04,041
In fact, I just purchased
a Hurberry jacket.

209
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,000
The price was roughly the same
as the Steyr AUG rifle

210
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:11,750
used by Austria's army, or the
cost of six 40mm anti-AS shells.

211
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,083
Look, you don't need to
say all that crazy stuff.

212
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,833
Now, what special skills
do you have?

213
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,875
Scouting, recon, setting bombs,
and operation of the AS.

214
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,666
No! Tell me Shirai's
special skills!

215
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,541
Um, impure sexual relations,
and also, uh...

216
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,708
Nobody brags about being good
at something indecent!

217
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,666
Snowboards, or basketball!

218
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,083
[cheering]

219
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,375
[SOUSUKE]
Hm..

220
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,000
I do have some experience
playing basketball.

221
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,708
Back in Helmajistan, we used
an old RK92 as the net.

222
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:48,541
Helma-huh? RK90 who?
You can't say stuff like that!

223
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,000
[MIZUKI] Hey, Shirai,
where are we gonna go next?

224
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,916
[KANAME]
They're still at it?

225
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,375
[SOUSUKE]
I wanna see a movie.

226
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,250
[MIZUKI]
Ooh, what movie?!

227
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,791
[SOUSUKE] Jogging Man 2. I heard
the hacking was very realistic.

228
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,958
And it's supposed to be
full of suspense.

229
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,875
Though, I doubt a civilian
hacker has access to a computer

230
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,500
that can reach America's
National Security Agency.

231
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,083
[MIZUKI]
What're you talking about...?

232
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,416
[KANAME] Serves her right.
She's cracking.

233
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,250
[MIZUKI] I don't understand.
Can't you be serious?

234
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,708
[SOUSUKE]
I'm always serious.

235
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,875
Come on, ask me
another question.

236
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,958
[MIZUKI] In that case...
Shirai, do you love me?

237
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,125
[KANAME gasps]

238
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,875
[KANAME]
What did she say?!

239
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,333
[MIZUKI] Say it softly
like you always do...

240
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,791
[SOUSUKI] Right, uh...
I love you, Mizuki.

241
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:36,125
[KANAME] Okay, it's just
practice. Just practice...

242
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,958
[MIZUKI]
Tell me again, Shirai!

243
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,500
[SOUSUKE]
I love you, Mizuki...

244
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:40,791
[MIZUKI]
Again!

245
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,583
[SOUSUKE]
I love you, Mizuki!

246
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:47,208
[MIZUKI] Shirai, sweetheart...
Do you still love me?

247
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,541
[SOUSUKE]
I still love you, Mizuki.

248
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,041
[MIZUKI] Will you love me,
now and forever?

249
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:56,291
[SOUSUKE] Yes, Mizuki.
I will love you forever...

250
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,583
[KANAME growls]

251
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,583
[KANAME] Keep it down!
Some of us are trying to sleep!

252
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,083
[MIZUKI sobs]

253
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,708
[SOUSUKE] What's wrong,
why are you crying?!

254
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,916
[MIZUKI]
Shut up! I hate you. I hate you!

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,708
[SOUSUKE]
But just a few seconds ago--

256
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:17,750
[MIZUKI] I said shut up! And
stop staring at me like that!

257
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:18,916
[SOUSUKE]
I don't understand...

258
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,958
[KANAME sighs]

259
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,916
Oh, check it out!
Here they come!

260
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,083
[FRIEND A] Haven't seen you
in a long time, Mizuki!

261
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,833
I have to say, those
sandals are super cute!

262
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,458
Mizuki, have you lost weight?!

263
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:33,291
You think so?
Meet my friend! See?

264
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,000
Huh?

265
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,041
Now, from the right...

266
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,833
We have: Manami Akagi...

267
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,416
...Madoka Tsuge...

268
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,666
...and Shouko Midorikawa.

269
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,291
[KANAME]
They're like traffic lights.

270
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,458
[KANAME giggles]

271
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,250
So, Mizuki, where's
your boyfriend?

272
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:52,416
[SOUSUKE]
Hello, I'm Satoru Shirai.

273
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,041
It is nice to meet you.

274
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,375
[SOUSUKE] Sitting by the window
facing the road is dangerous.

275
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,500
I can't see the
entrance, either.

276
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,125
[KANAME]
What's dangerous...?

277
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,500
[SOUSUKE] A long time ago,
a fellow soldi-- I mean...

278
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,500
My junior highschool teacher was
attacked while he was eating.

279
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,708
He still has the scar from where

280
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,208
the 9mm went through
his shoulder.

281
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,708
[MIZUKI laughs]

282
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,875
[MIZUKI] What on earth are you
talking about, sweetheart?

283
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,666
[SHOUKO] Mr. Shirai
certainly is different

284
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,333
than Mizuki's stories about him.

285
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,833
[MANAMI] Seems like a clean,
dependable kinda guy.

286
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,541
I'm afraid you misjudge me.

287
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,833
I love to wear absurd and
totally impractical garments.

288
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,500
What's more, I derive
great pleasure from

289
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,041
spending time with women
for no apparent reason.

290
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,041
I'm just that kind of person.

291
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,416
[MADOKA] That's funny.
You don't seem that way.

292
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
[SOUSUKE] I don't blame you,
since you're all amateurs.

293
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,708
[KANAME]
Huh. Amateurs at what?

294
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:41,500
I may be like that, but Mizuki
is my irreplaceable girlfriend.

295
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,583
She's wonderful!

296
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,000
Stop it, Shirai!
Don't make me blush!

297
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,333
You're my special lady,

298
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,333
and I just wanna tell them
how precious you are!

299
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,041
[ALL]
Do tell!

300
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,875
As much as the political
value of a spy satellite!

301
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,500
[KANAME slurps]

302
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:10,583
Uh, is this the kind of movie
you wanna go see on a date?

303
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:11,333
What?!

304
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,583
[KANAME]
Hey, Sousuke!

305
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,583
[SOUSUKE] It's so stupid
to attack with bayonets!

306
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,500
They still have some
ammunition left!

307
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,000
Why don't they lure the enemies
to the hill behind them and

308
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:22,625
kill them one-by-one while the
front line gets stretched out?!

309
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,500
Mr. Shirai is totally awesome
at this game, isn't he?

[SOUSUKE growls]

311
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,416
[GIRLS]
Hm...

312
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,375
Um, don't you think they've
figured it out by now?

313
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,458
We're fine as long as
we can keep it up

314
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,791
until we leave the park.
After that, I'll manage.

315
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,916
Hey, if you say so.

316
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,416
[MADOKA] Mizuki, is that
guy really Shirai?

317
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,916
[MIZUKI]
Of course.

318
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,333
[MADOKA] But he's like
a totally different guy

319
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,875
than what we thought
'cause of what you've said.

320
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,541
Are you sure there
isn't something

321
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,000
that you're hiding from us?

322
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,208
I'm not hiding anything!

323
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,083
Well, Mizuki,
what're you doin' here?

324
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,333
Uh... Shirai!

325
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,208
[GIRLS]
Huh?

326
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,958
[KANAME gasps]
Gotcha...!

327
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,291
[SHIRAI]
Why'd you do that to me?

328
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,708
Do what?

329
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,541
[SHIRAI] Don't act all innocent!
Every restaurant in town

330
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,750
said it was a young woman's
voice, so say something, Mizuki!

331
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,625
Oh yeah... right... something.

332
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,791
Ow, what'd you do
that for, Miss Chidori?

333
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,208
[KANAME laughs]

334
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,791
Sorry, but you and I need
to have a talk somewhere.

335
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,500
Pizza place,
noodle shop, wherever.

336
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,500
Sagara...?

337
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:27,708
Get lost, eh?

--[gun firing]
--[screaming]

339
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,375
Well, here I am, Satoru Shirai,
back with your drinks.

340
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,541
[growling]

341
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,000
Uh, Sousuke, everyone
found out already.

342
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,708
Um, what do you mean?

343
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh, Mizuki...

344
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,708
Why are you looking
at me like that?

345
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,708
Do you think I'm lying
to you or something?

346
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,458
No, no. I didn't say
you were lying, but you...

347
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,583
I really wanna see how
deeply in love you two are!

348
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,083
Perhaps I'd be more
inclined to believe you...

349
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,541
[GIRLS]
...if you kissed!

350
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,166
K-Kiss him?!

351
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,750
[MANAMI] Can't you two do that?
You're in love, right?

352
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,041
W-Well, you see...

353
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,000
Gee, it's awfully strange,
don't you think?

354
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,250
Most peculiar...

355
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,291
Hey, Chidori, when they
say kiss, do they mean

356
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,208
putting your mouth
to someone else's?

357
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,291
Um, yes, Einstein.

358
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,541
[MIZUKI]
Uh! W-Wait!

359
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,541
[gasping]

360
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,500
[MIZUKI sighs]

361
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,750
[MIZUKI] You are
absolutely the worst kind!

362
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:33,083
Who said you could kiss me?!
What kind of nerve--?!

363
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:38,000
Shirai and Sousuke...
All of you!

364
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,916
I hate you all!

365
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,166
[MIZUKI sobs]

366
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,625
Miss Chidori, was that guy
we saw with the girl earlier

367
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,250
the real Satoru Shirai?

368
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,666
That's right.

369
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,083
The one sinking into the lake
there is Sousuke Sagara,

370
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,541
and he has no connection
to Mizuki whatsoever!

371
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:58,041
He's just a stupid, perverted,
war-crazy military maniac!

372
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,375
[MADOKA] Okay, that was a
little too much information.

373
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,875
[KANAME]
It's true! It's what he is!

374
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,291
He does whatever
people tell him to.

375
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,333
He's just like Mizuki said,
and I hate him, too!

376
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,500
[KANAME pants]

377
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,083
Hey, uh, Minami,
we better get a move on.

378
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,750
[MINAMI]
Yeah, okay, let's go.

379
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,791
Uh, you're going back home?

380
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,291
Ah, yeah, we have
to go find Mizuki.

381
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,000
She must be feeling really
depressed right about now.

382
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,750
She might be selfish, stubborn,

383
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,666
sneaky, and a bit
of a show-off and...

384
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,083
But the fact is...

385
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:30,166
When you get right down
to it, she's just lonely.

386
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,875
See you, Miss Chidori.
Have fun with Mr. Sagara.

387
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:37,291
Uh, for the record,
we're not really like that!

388
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,375
Thank goodness.

389
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,333
Hey, have you taken up
permanent residence over there?!

390
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,708
Um, no. Did I do something
that I wasn't supposed to do?

391
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,083
You kissed her without
getting her permission!

392
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,583
Isn't that, like, some kind
of sexual assault?!

393
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,833
[SOUSUKE]
That was not my intent.

394
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,000
So what was your intent then?

395
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,083
Can you just kiss
anybody like that?!

396
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,125
Yes, when it's necessary.

397
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,125
I have kissed all
sorts of men, and I--

398
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:05,958
[KANAME]
Uh--

399
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:06,875
[SOUSUKE]
Yes!

400
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:07,916
There was a Turkish mercenary

401
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,041
who took a bullet
to the stomach.

402
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,333
And there was an old
Tajik man who was blown away

403
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,875
in an explosion.

404
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:19,250
Some of them I revived,
but the others...

405
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,750
Okay, I get it.
Why don't you stand up?

406
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,791
I don't know, you still
look like you're angry.

407
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,458
I'm fine, but you're
gonna catch cold

408
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,625
if you don't get out of there.

409
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,250
[KANAME gasps]

410
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,208
[SOUSUKE]
What's wrong, Chidori?

411
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,416
Your face just turned red.

412
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,458
Ah! Is that so?

413
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,958
Is there something wrong
with your health?

414
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,708
No, no! Nothing's wrong!

415
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,208
[KANAME giggles]

416
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,333
Ah, yes. It might be
some kind of disorder

417
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,791
of the circulatory system.

418
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,625
I think you should
see a doctor at once.

419
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,875
I'm telling you
there's nothing wrong!

420
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,500
God, you're impossible!

421
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,041
[SOUSUKE]
She's still angry...

422
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,083
I'm not angry!

423
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,083
Big, fat idiot! How come
I need to be angry?!

424
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,083
I'm not angry!
What does he know anyway?!

425
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:17,666
[incoherent mumbling]

426
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,250
[KANAME] I'm sorry, Sousuke,
I said more than I should've.

427
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,750
Let me cook you dinner
to make up for--

[KANAME gasps]

429
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,500
[KANAME] Why is there
a girl in your room?!

430
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:09,541
Next Full Metal Panic, episode
8: "Dangerous Safe House."

431
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,083
Who the heck is she?!

432
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,500
[SOUSUKE]
She's the submarine captain.

433
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,000
[KANAME]
You expect me to believe that?!
