00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,208
[SHINTARO]
The 96 model has a weak joint

2
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,625
on its right arm.

3
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:12,500
They've accurately recreated
even the weakness.

4
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,250
Of course, when
Ban Presto's making it...

5
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,791
[SHINTARO sighs]
Shinji...

6
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,708
[thunder]

7
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,625
Summer!

8
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:34,250
Ocean!

9
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:40,791
And... sweet...
summer... memories...

10
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,041
[yelps]

11
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:51,875
Please don't tell me

12
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,666
this is supposed to be the
highlight of the summer?

13
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,833
Hey, at least we're
still in Chiba, right?

14
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,083
Listen to me!

15
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,750
We were supposed to go
swimming in Kujukuri,

16
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,375
or walk the white
sands of Onjuku!

17
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,958
Haven't you ever listened
to the Beach Boys?

18
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,583
That's what a summer's
supposed to be!

19
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,833
Okay, we can go in now!

20
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,333
I've checked out the security!

21
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,375
So stop goofing around!

22
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,125
You! It's your fault.
It's all because of you!

23
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:16,250
You shouldn't have come with us
if it bothered you this much.

24
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,958
She's right. You shoulda
opened your mouth

25
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,375
and told them that when Sousuke
agreed with Shinji's idea.

26
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,083
Besides, you're in
high schol now,

27
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,916
so stop trying to ruin
the fun for the rest of us

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,375
just 'cause you
didn't get your way.

29
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,541
It could even be more
exciting than swimming,

30
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,583
like if a really hot
BS pilot asked me out.

31
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,125
Ooh, what do ya
think I should do

32
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,875
if one of them comes up and
asks me to play BS with him?

33
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:42,291
I think the term you're
looking for is AS.

34
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,291
[SHINTARO] We need to break
our losing streak here

35
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,666
at the Post Festival.

36
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,500
Those guys from
Nerima have taken

37
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,708
to calling themselves
the "Red Dragon"

38
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,333
in their latest and most
ridiculous challenge

39
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,166
We need to give
these jokers hell!

40
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,250
I want to wish you all,
the best of luck!

41
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,791
Start boarding your mechs!

42
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,500
[MEN]
Yeah!

43
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:15,083
[VENDORS shouting]

44
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:18,291
Check this out! I got the
very best Nerima daikon.

45
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,875
Go ahead, mister.
Try some of this radish.

46
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,250
[MAN IN COSTUME] The big battle
of the machine troops

47
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,541
is gonna start soon.

48
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,375
You kids don't wanna
miss the action.

49
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,208
Wow, it looks really stupid.

50
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,375
Duh. It's just a cardboard box.

51
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,666
[MAN IN COSTUME] Aw, but the
real ones look super cool.

52
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,166
[CHILD A] You're gonna lose
again this year, huh?

53
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,041
Let's go.

54
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:41,791
[SHINJI] Aw man. Even the
little kids call him stupid.

55
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:42,958
[SOUSUKE]
Hm?

56
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,166
The real AS trooper's
here. Super weak.

57
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,958
[SOUSUKE] Are there problems
with the equipment?

58
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,708
[SHINJI] Uh-uh, the
equipment's supposed to be

59
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,083
some of the best in Japan.

60
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,416
They're paratroopers.

61
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,958
Okay, so why are they weak?

62
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,166
Well, their equipment

63
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,875
is the only thing they
have goin' for 'em.

64
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,666
Huh...

65
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,666
[SHINTARO]
Shinji!

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,625
[SHINJI]
Huh?

67
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,500

68
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,291
Heh. And you must be Mr. Sagara.

Sir! Sergeant
Sousuke Sagara, sir!

00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:10,750
[SHINTARO]
Hm?

71
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,541
[SOUSUKE]
I-I mean, it's nice to meet you.

72
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,791
Hi. Shintaro Kazama's the name.

73
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,083
I work as a secretary
on the base.

74
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,375
I admit I'm surprised,
because Shinji's never brought

75
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,208
his friends to the
festival before.

76
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,500
Geez, Dad. Could you
put a lid on it?

77
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,875
See? It's things like that

78
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,708
which make me worry
about him sometimes.

79
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,333
Come on, Dad. Cut it out.

80
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,625
Anyway, I hope you
have a good time here.

Yes, sir. I will,

[SHINTARO]
What an unusual kid.

He's got real military manners.

Hm?

00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,625
[KYOKO]
That's gotta take some skill.

86
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,333
[MIZUKI] I'm really wishing
I hadn't ordered something

87
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,708
with seaweed in it.

88
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,041
Get that stuck in my teeth,
no one will ask me out.

89
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,458
[KYOKO] Hey, do you
want anything, Kaname?

[RYUNOSUKE]
Hi there.

92
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,375
So, where're you girls from?

93
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,250
Uh, we came in from Sengawa.

94
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,625
What a coincidence!

95
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,250
My group just got
here from Nerima...

96
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,250
[KANAME]
What's his deal?

97
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,541
[MIZUKI]
Weird sunglasses.

[KYOKO]
Cosplayer?

99
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,166
How'd you like to check out
an AS from the inside?

100
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,291
[GIRLS]
Huh?

101
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,541
I'll let you feel the power

102
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,500
of the Nerima Red Dragon
up close and personal.

103
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,750
The Nerima Daikon?

104
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,875
No! I said, "Nerima Red Dragon."

105
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,250
A red colored dragon, okay?

106
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,375
What d'ya say?

107
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,375
Oh, yes!

108
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,708
I'd love to try it out with you!

109
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,125
My name: Ryonosuke Akagi.

110
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,041
And you are?

111
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,208
Eh?

112
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,166
Someone who's not big on AS

113
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,791
or the raving idiots
who go gaga over them.

114
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,291
Don't you worry, baby.

115
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,250
I'll teach you AS from A to Z.

116
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,250
[KANAME]
No, thank you.

117
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,291
Heh. She's even cuter
when she's angry.

118
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,291
Captain Akagi, it's time for
us to start boarding now.

119
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,041
Roger that.

If you girls will excuse me.

[MIZUKI]
Urg... What is going on here?

122
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,125
How come you pick
her and not me?

123
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,125
You wait, Kaname.
I'll have my revenge.

124
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,708
Well, I don't think
it's her fault.

125
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,875
Why does everyone
look so depressed?

126
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:16,875
Did something happen?

127

00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,333
the battle of the

132
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,916
featuring Team Narashino
vs. Team Nerima.

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,166
Will the players please
enter the ring?

134
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:39,625
Akagi! Watch out 'cause
we're gonna win this year!

Hah! What are ya talkin' about?

136
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:45,750
The Nerima Red Dragon is gonna
fry you all nice and crispy.

137
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,125
--[KANAME] Huh?
--[KYOKO] Must be Daikon.

I won't forgive him.

139
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,875
[SHINJI, SOUSUKE]
Huh?

140
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,375
[gunshot]

141
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,708
[MACHINE TROOPS]
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

142
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,125
Hah! We can do this In one shot.

143
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,291
Divert maximum power
to the right arm.

144
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,666
Diverting maximum power
to the right arm!

145
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,041
Now pull!

146
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,416
[ANNOUNCEMENT]
Oh, ho, ho!

147
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,791
Team Nerima shows its
strength once again.

148
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,708
It seems that Team
Narashino is rather weak.

149
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,666
Weak doesn't even begin
to describe it.

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,625
Another weak show.

151
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,458
[ANNOUNCEMENT]
Narashino's not giving up.

152
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,375
It looks like they're
couching on their anchors.

153
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,500
Let's take the lead!

154
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,291
But we've already
reached top speed, sir.

155
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,625
Don't be soft on them.

156
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,291
Cancel the power limiter.

157
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,708
Canceling!

158
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,708
[ANNOUNCEMENT]
Wow, what a hit!

159
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,375
It looks like Nerima wins again!

Hey! Why don't you

Calm down, Shinji.

Huh? Uh...

Looks like they're
sitting in tandem.

164
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,875
There should be a gap
in their synchronization.

00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,791
I say we take advantage of that.

Uh, we're sitting
in tandem too, sir.

Plan b. Roger.

Ah! Here it comes,

No way.

Can you hear me, Nerima Daikon?

[RYUNOSUKE]
That's Nerima Red Dragon.

[SOUSUKE] This is supposed
to be a contest.

195

Not a war.

196
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,875
You shouldn't use such
underhanded tactics.

197

[RYUNOSUKE] Hmph. Let's talk
where I can see you.

It certainly was a
beautiful smash.

Let's see your face.

Oh, so an AS pilot
needs no name?

202
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,500
Very well.

203
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,958
I challenge you!

00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,875
[SOUSUKE]
No problems here.

Sousuke, just what do
you think you're doing?

[SOUSUKE]
How did you know it was me?

00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,541
You're the only one

00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,500
who would do something
this ridiculous.

209
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,791
[SOUSUKE]
But the contest should be

210
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,291
about conforming to the
spirit of fair play.

211

Ugh! You...! Ah!

Why did I have to
come to this place?

Uh, bad Shinji.

are you doing?

[KANAME growls]

really handsome guy.

Well, after some discussion,

I never knew we had
such a skilled AS pilot

here in Narashino
right under our noses.

but to become a secretary?

at piloting the AS, right?

I started reading AS fan
in the first place?

how difficult it was

to opperate an AS

and I hoped that would
help me figure out

00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,500
why you could never
hack it as a pilot,

when the other guys
make it look easy.

something important.

The background support team

plays an important
role in the battle,

even if they're
not on the field.

276

Soldiers on the front lines
can't show their abilities

have a chance, don't I?

[RYUNOSUKE] I only fought with
him once, and briefly at that,

was a skilled AS pilot.

Of course, I don't think I'd
lose if I had you with me.

[SOUSUKE] The unexpected
attack of an amatuer

Just pretend like you're
in gym class, okay?

319
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,916
I'm here if you need anything.

320
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,625
Please do not touch me.

321

[ANNOUNCEMENT] The cavalry
battle is about to start!

322
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,041
Players, take your positions!

323
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,708
[KOSUGE]
He used to be such a good kid.

324
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,291
[KOSUGE] But they haven't been
getting along too well lately.

325
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,125
I heard they were arguing
like that just the other day

326
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,208
when the secretary broke

327
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,666
that plastic model
Shinji gave him.

328
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,125
The Kazamas' teamwork
is in bad shape.

329
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,750
Teamwork will often
times get formed

330
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,250
during the heat of the battle.

331
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,666
You never know untill
you're actually there.

332
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,625
[ANNOUNCEMENT]
Ready!

333
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,416
[SHINTARO]
How did you talk me into this?

334
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,583
[SHINJI] Don't worry, Dad.
I've got it under control.

335
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,625
What do ya mean?

336
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,541
Since when do yo--

337
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,875
One of the assistants
gave me this disc to use.

338
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,708
[KANAME]
What do I do?

339
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:23,958
Tell me what to do!

340
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,500
It's quite simple.

341
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,500
Just imagine you're punching
someone you really, really hate.

342
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,208
No problem.

343
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,000
Take this!

344
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:32,875
Ah!

345
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,583
Quick! Block with your arm!

346
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,125
Hey, this OS is awesome!

347
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,333
They blocked me.

348
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,416
It's all right, babe.
You're a natural.

349
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,666
Try it one more time.

350
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,875
You think so?

351
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,708
Then watch this.

352
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,166
The Captain's machine moves

353
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,416
in a totally different
way than the others.

354
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,625
Miss Kaname, he's got to be
the one piloting it.

355
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:57,833
Gotcha!

356
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,125
Hey, Sousuke!

357
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,000
We can't afford to
underestimate their captain.

358
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,750
He's rather adept, you know.

359
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:03,875
You think so?

360
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,375
I don't know.

361
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,250
Most of their punchs were
looking a little funny to me.

362
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,708
Okay, C group, D group,

363
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,875
help out the Kazamas in
B group on both sides.

364
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,083
[C GROUP]
C group, roger!

365
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,458
[D GROUP]
D group, ten four!

366
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,041
So what's our plan for now?

367
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,583
Our current tactical
strategy is fairly simple.

368
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,416
As long as we beat
the Captain's machine,

369
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,666
we have a chance to win.

370
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,083
You have an interesting
way of looking at it.

371
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,416
Roger that.

372
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,666

[RYUNOSUKE]
Don't worry.

375
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,458
We're about to teach your
boyfriend a little lesson.

376
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,708
Huh?

377
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:38,666
B group, C group,
let's do our special move!

378
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,000
They're coming!

379
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,458
It's the Red Stream attack
of three stars in a row!

380
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,833
The Red, what?

381
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,958
They did a leap frog maneuver!

382
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,625
Uh-oh! Ah!

383
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,000
Assume low stance.

384
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,916
Assuming low stance.

385
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,625
Those guys beat us with
that move every year.

386
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,000
The wait, the timing, the power,

387
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,541
the sheer decisiveness
of it all... Perfect.

388
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,375
That felt really good!

389
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,833
[RYUNOSUKE] If you beat the
enemy, you'll feel even better.

390
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:13,000
I'd feel better if you
weren't hanging over me.

turning the right leg.

Yeah, I know, but what
can I do about it?

393
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:18,833
[SOUSUKE]
Get out of there!

394
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,333
We'll take over from here!

What are you saying?

396
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,875
We can't just leave you
alone to face the enemy!

the Narashino Airborne spirit!

404

Oh, Shinji...
I'm hopelessly clumsy.

405
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,625
I can't even repair
a plastic model,

406
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:54,458
but still, I can't just give up
and throw in the towel.

Uh, no, it's called

00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,375
[SOUSUKE]
An assassination.

478
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:04,250
[KANAME]
Seriously?

479
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,291
[SOUSUKE]
Seriously.

480
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,666
[KANAME]
Okay...

481
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,000
Next Full Metal Panic,
Episode 15:

482
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,166
"The Wind Blows
at Home, Part 1."

483
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,166
You need to make
sure you come back.

484
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,958
[SOUSUKE]
If I'm lucky.
