Once we start the operation,

00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,958
these two UN transport planes

00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:09,416
will land with our support,
accommodate the hostage group

from the jumbo jet,
and take off within 5 minutes.

What? In 5 minutes?!
That's not enough time!

6
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:19,000
Five minutes is an eternity to
be protecting a target that big.

7
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,541
What should we do if one of the
transport planes gets destroyed

while it's taking off?

9
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,333

in one of the

As a last resort,
you may ditch your AS,

to destroy it completely.

00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,458
Don't piss me off!

319
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,958
[KANAME screams, grunts]

[KANAME]
Pull yourself together, Sousuke!

321
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:03,375
I don't wanna escape by myself!

322
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:07,000
Why do ya have to send me back?
Why can't we go back together?

Next Full Metal Panic,
Episode 6: "Still Alive."

324
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,500

00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,291
[SOUSUKE]
