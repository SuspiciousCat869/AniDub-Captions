1
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,500
[TELETHA]
I'm sorry I called you up here.

2
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:14,875
[KANAME] That's okay. Did you
wanna talk about something?

3
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,708
I was thinking it
would be best

4
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,041
if I could talk with you
before things start to get

5
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,875
too hectic around here.

6
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,875
Is it... about Mithril?

7
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:26,041
Well, no. It's actually
about you and me.

8
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:26,583
Huh?

9
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:27,750
The Whispered.

10
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,041
[gasps]

11
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,625
I think you may have
noticed already,

12
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:34,166
but I'm also one of them.

13
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,750
[gasps]

14
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,625
[TELETHA] The Whispered are
said to be a gold mine of

15
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,208
Black Technology.

16
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,583
Under the right conditions,
they can supply

17
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,833
scientific theories and
engineering concepts

18
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:53,041
which are far higher than
the current standard.

19
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,125
[KANAME]
Can I do that, too?

20
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,291
[TELETHA]
As far as I know,

21
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,916
you've shown your power
at least twice.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,541
The first time was in the
mountains of the Conga region.

23
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:07,083
The second time was at
the battle with Behemoth.

24
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,125
On both occasions,
you knew something

25
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,375
you never could have learned.

26
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:22,583
Of course, I did give you a
little help the second time.

27
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,375
Wait, you helped me?

28
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:27,125
[TELETHA]
Miss Kaname, listen to me!

29
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,416
[gasps]

30
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,416
Don't you remember?

31
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,875
[KANAME]
Uh... I don't really understand

32
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,958
what happened at that time.

33
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,875
What happened then
is called resonance.

34
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,250
Resonance?

35
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,333
Yes. What this means is that

36
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,791
we Whispereds can share
our thoughts with each other

37
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,625
at the deeper levels
of the psyche.

38
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:47,875
It happens at times when

39
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,083
you and I both feel
we need each other.

40
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,291
It gives us a connection.

41
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,541
[KANAME]
Huh?

42
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,125
[TELETHA] This is a very
dangerous thing to do.

43
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,583
We need to try and avoid
the Whispered's resonance

44
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,291
as much as possible.

45
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:05,083
[KANAME] Why? If we do have
such a handy power available...

46
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,333
Something as convenient
as this can often be

47
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:10,375
a double-edged
sword, unfortunately.

48
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,083
The Whispereds resonance
is more like mind sharing

49
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,750
than conversation.

50
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,416
We begin to blend into
each other and become one.

51
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,083
Like this for example.

52
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,416
[TELETHA]
See, it's too late.

53
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,125
I can't separate the tea
and the milk anymore.

54
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,791
You could lose yourself,

55
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,541
cease to be, if you
make one false step.

56
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:49,541
Okay... I kinda get it,
and I kinda don't.

57
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,833
I'm sorry if I'm speaking
in abstract terms here.

58
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,416
Truth is, I'm not sure
that I understand it

59
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,916
all that well myself.

60
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:08,125
Anyway, Miss Kaname, the reason
I'm telling you all this

61
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,125
is that there are some
people who want the power

62
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,125
of the Whispered at any cost.

63
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,750
[KANAME]
You mean like that Gauron guy?

64
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,958
[TELETHA]
Yes. He wants your power.

65
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:20,083
If he found out about me,
he would be after me as well.

66
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,291
He will stoop to any means
to achieve his twisted goals.

67
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,458
[KANAME]
Oh, god.

68
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,583
But whatever happens, I want you
to know you're not alone.

69
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,166
We at Mithril have
absolutely no intention of

70
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,833
letting you fall into
the enemy's hands.

71
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,625
So that's why Sousuke's
been with me?

72
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,416
Oh... uh...

73
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,916
[laughs] Though I don't think
I've ever heard of a guard

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,458
who is such a handful.

75
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,208
Sousuke says, "I'm here
to protect you."

76
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:51,708
But he always ends up blowing
himself up or something.

77
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:55,333
I mean, the guy's like an extra
from a bad war movie, right?

78
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,583
At least he's fun
to watch though.

79
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,250
Ha! Don't think for a
minute that I've thrown up

80
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,333
the white flag!

81
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,833
Huh?

82
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,125
If you wanna know the truth,
I often see him at the base,

83
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,625
even in times of peace.

84
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,333
Are... Are you serious?

85
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:13,125
Yes. In fact, we even went
out to a sandy beach.

86
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,458
There was nobody else around.

87
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,125
A beach. A sandy beach...

88
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:23,666
[TELETHA giggles]
The rest is a secret.

89
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,875
[KANAME]
Look, you.

90
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,583
Guess we're even now, huh?

91
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:31,500
You got it wrong. Sousuke and
I are nothing like that.

92
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,041
[KALININ]
As I informed you earlier,

93
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:53,750
an armed group has seized
this US military facility:

94

the chemical weapons

95
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,833
on Perio's Berildaobu Island,

96
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:01,333
which is currently storing a
few hundred tons of nerve gas.

97
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,208
The armed group is threatening
to release every last drum of

98
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,291
nerve gas now in storage
unless their demands are met.

--[GUYS whispering]
--[LEADER] Be quiet!

100
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,791
[KALININ] Our main duty is
to suppress the enemy AS units

101
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:16,333
and secure the safety of any
hostages taken by the enemy.

102
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,208
We estimate their current
fire power at nine AS's

103
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,166
and five self-propelled
Triple A's.

104
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,166
What the... What is that?

105
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,250
This AS is thought to be
Russia's latest model.

106
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,125
It is supposed to be the
successor to the Savage.

107
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:36,208
And we know we can engage it
in combat using ordinary mecha

108
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,708
and traditional battle tactics.

109
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,375
However, there is one enemy AS

110
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,291
to which we must pay
special attention.

111

[KURZ gasps]

112
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,375
This mecha has been loaded
with special equipment,

113
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:57,375
so ordinary attacks against it
are going to be ineffective.

114
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:01,166
If you should encounter this AS,
you must avoid a direct battle.

115
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,000
In short, run away.

why don't we surround it

You don't know
what we're facing.

122
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,666
When I say run away,

123
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,458
it's not a suggestion
or request, but an order.

124
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,250
Failure to follow orders
will be punished...

125
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:29,000
...assuming you're still
alive at the end.

126
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,708
For convenience's sake,
we will call this AS Venom.

127
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,541
Sergeant Sagara is to engage

128
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:40,583
and hopefully annihilate
Venom using Arbalest.

129
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,916
Once we encounter Venom,

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,625
everyone else will fall back
into support roles.

131

Don't let up for a moment.

132
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:49,458
Collaborate and force
close-quarters combat.

133
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,958
Then the victory
will come to us.

134
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,875
And what if I should
lose the battle?

135
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,375
The operation will fail,

00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,000
Of course.

142
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,916
How could he say what
he did in the briefing

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,958
after reading the reports
from Helmajistan?

Ha!

The whole Indian
Ocean squadron...

146
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,791
They treat Sousuke like
he's some kinda murderer

or something.

148
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,083
Though I can't blame them,
seeing as how the rest

he could've joined them there,

Maybe you and me could go to
the cockpit for a little-- Ugh!

160
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,625
What's wrong? You
shouldn't be down here.

161
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,541
I-I was gonna... Well, I...

162
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,250
Sousuke? Well, there's
nothin' to worry about.

163
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,916
His last mission was
just a bit rough.

164
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,083
[MELISSA] Well, I'm afraid we'll
be heading out pretty soon.

165
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,458
Heading out?

166
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,291
[inaudible]

167
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,208
Sorry to have disturbed you.

168
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,166
[OPERATOR]
Current depth: 80.

169
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,625
Speed: 3 knots.
EMFC: no problems.

170
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,958
[OPERATOR 2] Current is
from the northwest, 2 knots.

171
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,375
Slight breeze on the surface.

172
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,375
[OPERATOR] AS chambers
are airtight. All green.

173
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,541
Commander, please start
filling AS chambers number one

174
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,333
and number six with water.

175
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,208
[MARDUKAS] Aye, ma'am.
Commence flooding of the

176
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:56,375
number one and number six
AS chambers.

177
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,041
[KALININ] This time, we will
deploy troops under water.

178
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,916
Six AS's will split
into three teams:

179
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,458
blitz, cover, and bomb squad.

180
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,958
McAllen and Sagara
will rush the enemy.

181
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,041
Weber and Guen will
support with cover fire.

182
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:13,791
Mao and Danigan will
work bomb squad.

183
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:17,375
Split up and head to your
stations after passing waypoint.

184
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,666
That's all.

185
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,083
Commander, open all AS hatches.

186
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,791
Aye, ma'am. Open all
hatches for AS deployment.

187
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,083
And what if I should
lose the battle?

188
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,666
The operation will fail,

189
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,375
and your fellow soldiers
will become his victims.

190
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,625
[MELISSA]
Sousuke.

191
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:11,958
Yes, go ahead, Mao.

192
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,166
[MELISSA] You seem awful
gung-ho about this.

193
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,458
What does that mean?

194
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,541
[MELISSA] Don't bite off
more than you can chew.

195
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,250
Look, nobody is listening
to this channel.

196
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,708
[SOUSUKE]
It doesn't matter, I'm--

197
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,166
[MELISSA] If you're thinking
that it's all up to you to

198
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,333
protect us along with
Kaname, you're dreaming.

199
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,583
[gasps]

200
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,833
I'm gonna have to say
"thanks, but no thanks."

201
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,500
I imagine Kurz, McAllen,
and everyone else

202
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,500
would say the same thing.

203
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,875
Maybe you're right, Mao.
I'll keep that in mind.

204
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,333
[MELISSA]
Good man. Talk to you later.

205
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,416
[MCALLEN]
Urzu 1 to all members.

206
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,625
That was waypoint three
we just passed.

207
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,875
We'll split into
separate groups now.

208
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,291
[MELISSA]
Urzu 2, roger.

209
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,666
[KURZ]
Urzu 6, roger.

210
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,041
[SOUSUKE]
Urzu 7, roger.

211
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,458
[GUEN]
Urzu 10, roger.

212
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,875
[DANIGAN]
Urzu 12, roger.

213
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,000
[MELISSA] These tunnels
are awful convenient.

214
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:19,166
Santa Claus'll have an easy
time of it come Christmas.

215
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,333
[DANIGAN]
Freakin' A.

216
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,291
Playing moles at the
bottom of the ocean.

217
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,500
How'd I get stuck
with this duty?

218
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,500
[MELISSA laughs]
Don't complain.

219
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,166
We're the only ones
who can do this job.

220
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,083
Whatever. Even if the
enemy's bombs went off,

221
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,416
I doubt our forces would
take on that much damage.

222
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,250
Granted, some of the
poor bastards who live

223
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,666
on these islands might die,
but hey, what the hell.

224
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,666
Danigan!

225
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,666
[DANIGAN]
It's a joke. Lighten up.

226
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,333
[MELISSA] I don't think
those jokes are appropriate

227
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,291
during a mission. Get serious.

228
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,666
[DANIGAN]
Don't get all worked up over it.

229
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,500
I'll do my job right.

230
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,166
[MELISSA]
I sure hope so.

231
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,875
[KURZ]
I wonder if they'll pull it off.

232
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,041
[GUEN]
If they make a mistake,

233
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,125
we've only got
one option: run away.

234
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,250
We're not paid enough
to fight in poison gas.

235
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,333
[KURZ]
Ha. You got that right!

236
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,291
Mithril's got great equipment,
and they pay okay,

237
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,500
but the way they go about
business is so damn slow.

238
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,250
"Secure the hostages and don't
play with chemical weapons."

239
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,708
That's what they tell us.

240
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,791
Yeah, but I'm guessin'
a regular storm trooper

241
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,250
doesn't pull in our salary.

242
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,166
[SOUSUKE]
AI, set power to Military.

243
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:41,125
[ARBALEST A.I.] Roger. GPL,
military. Power is increasing.

244
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,750
--20... 30...
--[MELISSA] This is Urzu 2.

245
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,166
We successfully
disarmed the bombs.

246
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,541
On our way to ground level.

247
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,916
[KURZ]
Urzu 6, I'm ready any time.

248
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,708
[GUEN]
Urzu 10, so am I.

249
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:55,291
[ARBALEST A.I.]
80... 90... 100.

250
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,875
[MCALLEN] Urzu 1 to all members.
It's open season. Go attack.

251
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,166
Roger.

252
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,875
[OPERATOR] It's started!
A signal for commencing

253
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,500
the attack has been
received from the M9's ADM.

254
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:47,458
We'll surface now. Please
prepare to raise all ECS masts.

255
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,916
Set MBT to normal.

256
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,416
[GUEN]
This is Urzu 10.

257
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,666
I've destroyed all the confirmed
anti-aircraft artillery.

258
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,125
[KURZ]
Urzu 6 here.

259
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,750
I've killed all the enemies
I can see from this point.

260
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,166
Send me some more.

261
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,333
[DANIGAN]
Urzu 12, I'm on the ground.

262
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,875
I took B quarter under
control and secured it.

263
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,208
All hostages safe.

264
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,541
[MELISSA]
This is Urzu 2.

265
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,291
I've secured A quarter and
confirmed 23 hostages.

266
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,958
All of them are safe.

267
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,291
[SOUSUKE]
This is Urzu 7.

268
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,166
I've destroyed four
enemy AS's. Still searching.

269
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,583
[MCALLEN]
Urzu 1 to all members.

270
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,166
I haven't encountered Venom yet.

271
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,125
Did anybody see it?

272
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,166
[KURZ]
Negative. He's not in my space.

273
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,416
[GUEN]
Not here either.

274
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,250
[MELISSA] Negative. No,
affirmative. He's...

275
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,375
[gasps] What is this,
some kind of joke?

276
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,666
What's going on, Urzu 2? [gasps]

277
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,916
What the hell is that?

278
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,291
[GAURON]
Good to see you, Mithril.

279
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,291
I missed you.
Especially Kashim.

280
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:02,083
I never got to pay you back
for our time in the desert.

281
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,166
Gauron.

282
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,291
[GAURON]
Party time! Everybody dance.

283
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,500
[MCALLEN]
Urzu 1 to Urzu 6.

284
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,708
Can you shoot him?

285
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:14,958
[KURZ]
Negative.

286
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,083
I can't secure a line of
fire from this position.

287
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,708
I'm moving now.

288
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,250
[MCALLEN]
Urzu 10, what about missiles?

289
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,041
[GUEN]
I ran out, sir!

290
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,333
Oh, dammit to hell.

291
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,500
Urzu 7, go forward. Everyone
else stay back in support.

292

[SOUSUKE]
Seven, roger.

293
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,583
[DANIGAN] So this is what
they warned us about.

294
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,041
[SOUSUKE] Affirmative.
Don't get close to him.

295
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,875
[MELISSA]
Urzu 2 to all.

296
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,333
Try aiming for the weapon
instead of the body.

297
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,708
Go for the magazine
of the Gatling gun.

298
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,250
--[MELISSA gasps]
--What happened?

299

You're slowing down!

302
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,750
[MCALLEN]
Did we get him?

303
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,083
[MELISSA]
Be careful.

304
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,833
[GAURON]
Excellent job, guys.

[SOUSUKE]
Danigan! Stay back!

306
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,625
Should I use it?

307
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,708
AI, start the Lambda Driver!

308

Come on, AI. Answer me!

[GAURON]
Bang.

314
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,625
[gasps]

315
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,791
Mao!

316
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,958
Urzu 2! What happened?
Do you copy?

317
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,750
Urzu 2!

318
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,750
[gasps]

319
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,166
[GAURON laughs]

320
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,833
[MCALLEN]
Urzu 7, what's goin' on?

321
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,166
[SOUSUKE] This is Urzu 7,
Mao got injured.

322
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,500
Condition unknown.

323
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,125
[MCALLEN] Urzu 7, lost the
transmission. Repeat.

324
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,750
[SOUSUKE] Mao got injured.
Go help her. Hurry!

325
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,833
AI, wh-what's wrong?

326
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,791
Tell me why I couldn't use it!

327
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,916
Answer me, AI! Can't you
start the Lambda Driver?

328
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,541
[KURZ]
Sousuke, it's me, Kurz.

329
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,791
Take Venom to the
east end of the island.

330
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,916
Go back to that building.

331
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,250
What are you planning?

332
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,416
[KURZ]
It'll be okay. Leave it to me.

333
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,125
How far are you running?

334
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,083
[KURZ]
There! Stop there!

335
00:19:56,583 --> 00:20:01,000
You disappoint me!
I thought you were better!

336
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,125
[DANIGAN]
Did you do it?

337
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,000
[SOUSUKE]
I don't know.

338
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,375
Gimme the gun.

339
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,416
Stay back.

340
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:52,208
[GAURON] You did it.
It's overheated again.

341
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:03,125
[GAURON] Seems we've swapped
roles, Kashim. I surrender.

342
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,750
Do whatever your heart desires.

343
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,041
Go to hell, Gauron.

344
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:12,500
Better shoot me now. You might
regret it later, Kashim.

345
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:16,291
[MCALLEN]
Urzu 2, do you read me? Urzu 2!

[KALININ] The wounded animal
lashes out in desperation.

348
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:05,541
Dying comrades...
drifting hearts.
