00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,750
[INTERCOM STEWARDESS]
Passengers, welcome aboard.

2
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:05,166
This is flight JNA 903 departing
Tokyo on a flight path to Naha.

3
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,125
[MALE STUDENT A] Hey there,
Miss! Wanna join our party?

4
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,708
Hey, this is the
Marine Corps' M6

5
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,250
I was tellin' you about before!

6
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,875
[MAYUKO]
Awesome! We're really flying!

7
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,958
Oh, yeah! Hey, Kaname,
you have to check this out!

8
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,291
[KANAME groans]

9
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:19,833
Huh...?

10
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,500
[KANAME]
Hm?

11
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,166
Hey, what's up with you? You've
been weird since yesterday.

12
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,750
Is something bothering you?

13
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,458
Um... No, why?

14
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,541
Does it have to do with Sousuke?

15
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:34,791
[KANAME gasps]

16
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,750
Well, no! Why do you ask?
I mean, seriously.

17
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,291
[KANAME laughs]

18
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:42,041
All right, I get it.
I'll change the subject.

19
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,458
[gasping]

20
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,916
[MALE STUDENT B] Oh man,
I think the plane's tilted over!

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,333
[PASSENGERS screaming]

22
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,458
Nothing to worry about.
Just turbulence.

23
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,000
Right.

24
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:55,291
But it's kinda strange, what
with the weather being so clear.

25
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,125
[CO-PILOT whimpering]

26
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,125
W-W-What're you doing?!

27
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,458
[CO-PILOT gasps]

28
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,250
Perhaps you'd like to die, too?

29
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,000
[CO-PILOT]
No, please! If you kill me,

30
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,208
you'll have no one
to fly the plane!

31
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,500
Is that right?

32
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,250
'Cause you know,
I've always wanted a shot

33
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,583
at flying a commercial
aircraft like this one.

34
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:34,291
Seems like it would be more
fun than a transport plane.

35
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,833
What's your expert opinion?
How's this thing handle?

36
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,000
Please! Don't kill me, Mister!

37
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:44,458
Hm? I was just asking
if it was fun to fly.

38
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,208
[TERRORIST]
Gauron.

39
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,500
[GAURON]
Hm?

40
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,500
Oh. See what I
have to deal with?

41
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,875
What's the matter with you?

42
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,958
Why did you have to go
and kill the pilot?

43
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,625
He lied and told me the
plane was out of order.

44
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,708
Said he was going back
to Haneda so he could--

45
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,875
[TERRORIST] If you enjoy murder,
that's your own business.

46
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,791
But just in case you've
forgotten, this opportunity

47
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,958
has been given to you by
my country with one caveat.

48
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,625
You will not needless endanger
the success of our mission.

49
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,791
[GAURON chuckles]
Now, don't be like that.

50
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:17,458
As long as they listen to me,
I'll be a perfect gentleman.

51
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,166
Yes... Don't you agree?

52
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,041
You heard what the man said.

53
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll keep up my end and do
my best not to kill you.

54
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,958
But if you don't listen, I'll be
forced to kill someone else.

55
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,625
Passengers, all right?

56
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,541
Now, let's see...

57
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,958
I wanna turn this
plane and head north.

58
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,166
Our destination is
there on the map.

59
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,666
It's a fervently autocratic
enclave. Very rare these days.

60
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,625
Huh?

61
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,333
[SHINJI]
Hey, Sousuke, look over there!

62
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,041
It's an F16 with
UN markings on it.

63
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,875
I wonder why it's flying
around this airspace?

64
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,416
I'm sure it's nothing
to worry about.

65
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,875
[SHINJI]
Mm-hm.

66
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,000
[KYOKO]
Hey, Kaname...?

67
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,583
[KANAME]
Hm?

68
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,291
[KYOKO] Isn't Okinawa supposed
to be surrounded by the ocean?

69
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,708
Last time I checked.

70
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:26,083
Well, there's been nothing
but mountains for a long time.

71
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,083
[MALE STUDENT C]
This is getting weird.

72
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,625
Isn't there a flight attendant
around here somewhere?

73
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,041
I haven't seen one
in quite a while now...

74
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:44,125
[SHINJI] Something's not
right... This isn't Okinawa...

75
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,333
You know, I don't even
think we're in Japan.

76
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,875
So it would seem...

77
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:59,833
Well, gentleman. We're just
in time for the party.

78
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,000
[MALE STUDENT D]
Where are we?

79
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,458
[FEMALE STUDENT A]
This isn't Okinawa, is it?

80
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:13,000
Look, Sousuke! They've got a
Mig-21 out there on the tarmac!

81
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,916
And that tank over there?
Must be a T-54!

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,875
It's all, like,
junk from 50 years ago!

83
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,875
Wait a second;
they've got the latest RK-92!

84
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,041
Everything's Soviet-made,
but there's a huge gap

85
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,250
between the new and the old.

86
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,083
[GAURON]
Your attention please.

87
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,750
I'm speaking to you on
behalf of your captain.

88
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,750
Due to unavoidable
circumstances,

89
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,375
we've made an emergency landing

90
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,625
at this air base in the
autonomous region of Khanka.

91
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,500
What is that supposed to mean?!

92
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,791
[TEACHER] I didn't hear
anything about this!

93
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,000
[TEACHER ASSISTANT]
Hey, calm down!

94
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:48,083
Huh, I can't believe
she just noticed it now.

95
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,083
[GAURON] Given the complicated
political situation of the area,

96
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,750
I'm gonna need all of you to be
on your best hostage behavior.

97
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,708
Just so you understand
where I'm coming from,

98
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,000
please take a look
outside your window.

99
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,541
[STUDENTS gasp]

100
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,833
[GAURON] Do not be alarmed,
the soldiers and tanks only wish

101
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,000
to extend their welcome.

102
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,125
But if you try to escape or
hesitate to follow orders,

103
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,666
we will not hesitate
to shoot you.

104
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,916
We thank you for flying with us.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,541
[TELETHA]
We were completely taken in!

106
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,958
I thought we destroyed the
enemy's base of operations

107
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,458
to prevent things like this!

108
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,666
[KALININ] It seems there's
another mastermind involved

109
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,791
apart from the KGB.

110
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,375
The Khanka enclave...

111
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,958
But they're too weak for
something like this, no?

112
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:32,458
Right. It seems they and
the KGB are being used...

113
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,250
...by some unknown person.

114
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,125
What you're saying, then,
is this unknown person

115
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,291
took 400 hostages to cover
the kidnap of one girl,

116
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,750
and on top of that, chose a
politically difficult place

117
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,500
so mounting a rescue would
be next to impossible?

118
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,416
[KALININ]
A well-orchestrated hijack.

119
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,583
Typical terrorist methods.
Atypical execution.

120
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:50,833
A job well done.

121
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:51,958
Huh?

122
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,708
Uh...

123
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,500
[TELETHA]
Tell me, Lt. Commander.

124
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,125
What do you think
is the probability

125
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,541
of the hostages being
released safely?

126
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,541
You mean without Chidori, ma'am?

127
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,625
Of course. What I'm think is,
if we do nothing, it might be

128
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,583
easier getting the 400 other
people on board released

129
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,875
without a major incident.

130
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,708
I'm sure the autonomous region
of Khanka doesn't wish

131
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:16,250
to make the situation any more
complicated than it is.

132
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,875
[KALININ] There will be
no profit in it for them,

133
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,333
should even only a few hundred
Japanese citizens be murdered.

134
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,166
[TELETHA]
I agree.

135
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,083
We'll begin
diplomatic negotiations

136
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,208
and secure their safe return.

137
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,583
We'll find and rescue
Miss Chidori after.

138
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,250
That's a sound argument.

139
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,208
However--

140
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,458
[TELETHA]
We'll wait and see.

141
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,458
[KALININ]
Hm?

142
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,958
For the time being.

143
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:42,333
Very well. We can take
some time if you want.

144
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,416
But we may be giving
the snake an opportunity

145
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,291
to build up his venom.

146
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:53,125
I know... But we should wait
until we hear something.

147
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,083
[GAURON]
You, over there.

148
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,750
I'm talking to you, Miss.

149
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:04,083
Yes, you, the lovely young
lady with the long hair.

150
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,083
What is it?

151
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:11,500
I would like to send a videotape
off to the mass media,

152
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,541
and you're very photogenic.

153
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,875
You'd be the perfect
face for this tragedy.

154
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,750
Oh no, not me. I'm just
a plain, ordinary girl.

155
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,208
Emphasis on plain.
Nothing special at all.

156
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,166
In fact, your viewers might
get sick to their stomachs

157
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,916
watching me. I'm serious.

158
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,916
[GARUON] What did I say
about hesitating? Don't be shy.

159
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,041
Wait a minute...
Please, sir! Let go of me!

160
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,791
I don't wanna do it!
Why are you taking me?!

161
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:35,958
[KYOKO]
Kaname!

162
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,541
[TEACHER]
Hold on! My student!

163
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,000
What're you going
to do with her?

164
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,791
Not to worry, ma'am.
We'll return her very soon.

165
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,416
I'm not gonna
let you do that.

166
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,541
If you need someone,
you can take me.

167
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,791
You wouldn't arouse
as much sympathy.

168
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,458
This is for the mass media.

169
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,458
That is the worst
excuse I've ever heard!

170
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:53,750
You're nothing but a coward!

171
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:54,750
[GAURON]
Hm?

172
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,208
You're the worst
kind of criminal!

173
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,750
It's bad enough that you had
to hijack a plane at all!

174
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,125
Now you're going to take
a child, and for what?!

175
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,500
To make some point,
whatever that might've been?

176
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,916
It means nothing! It's garbage!

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,750
God will never forgive you
for what you've done--

178
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,375
My, my. Aren't we a
little chatterbox?

179

[gasping]

180
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,541
Oh my God...

181
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,916
No... Please don't...

182
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,541
[crashing]

183
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,708
I'm sorry.

184
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,583
Let go!

185
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,875
[GAURON growls]

186
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:40,625
[TERRORIST]
Gauron.

187
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:41,666
[GAURON]
Hm?

188
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,125
We need to move, so hurry up.

189
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,666
[GAURON]
Hm. Let's go.

190
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,000
We don't need all these
other people anymore.

191
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:56,916
[KANAME] Let me go!
I can walk by myself.

192
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,208
Teacher...

193
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,500
Shut up and keep moving.

194
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,291

[FEMALE STUDENT B]
Teacher!

197
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,208
[MALE STUDENT E]
Somebody call a doctor!

198
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,000
[SOUSUKE]
I'm so stupid!

199
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,458
[HENCHMAN A] I never expected
it to be this big.

200
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,916
[HENCHMAN B] We had to
consider both scenarios.

201
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,500
Detonation in the air,
and on the ground.

202
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:07,500
This should be more than enough.

203
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,750
[HENCHMAN B] Okay, see the
red cord down in there?

204
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,416
Remove the insulating tape,

205
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,083
and plug it into
the outlet marked "3."

206
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,583
[HENCHMAN A]
Found it. Plugging cord in.

207
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:18,750
[beep]

208
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,875
[HENCHMAN B]
Okay. Keep your hands clear,

209
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,291
and don't touch anything.

210
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,125
No one is allowed to
use walkie-talkies

211
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,791
or cell phones for 30 meters.

212
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,708
[GAURON]
When will you know the results?

213
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,041
[FEMALE DOCTOR] Tomorrow
morning at the earliest.

214
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:53,666
That's a long time. Couldn't
we expedite the process?

215
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,125
[FEMALE DOCTOR] The medications
won't take affect

216
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,250
until at least another
6 hours. If not more.

217
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,958
If I can't get my results,

218
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,041
maybe I should kill you
and take her elsewhere.

219
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,750
Don't be so impatient! You have
no idea what the Whispered are,

220
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,458
nor do you understand the
importance of this research!

221
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,041
[GAURON]
I beg to differ.

222
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,875
[FEMALE DCOTOR] how can you say
that when you have the nerve

223
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,750
to bring Codarl with you?!

224
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,125
[GAURON] It's my backup in case
the people of this country

225
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,333
have a sudden change of heart.

226
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,958
[FEMALE DOCTOR] Hmph.
Then you're a bigger coward

227
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,500
than I thought.

228
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,166
Don't be so cocky. You will do
exactly what I tell you to do.

229
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,458
Now, is that perfectly clear?!

230
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,916

[SOUSUKE gasps]

233
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:16,000
[SOUSUKE] Sgt. Sagara,
B-3128, Urzu 7 reporting.

234
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,250
[TELETHA]
Are you safe, Mr. Sagara?

235
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,500
[SOUSUKE]
That's an affirmative, Captain.

236
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,916
I'm so glad.

237
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,291
Sgt. Sagara, explain the
situation on the ground.

238
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,083
[TELETHA]
How terrible.

239
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,500
[SOUSUKE] It appears
they are going to kill

240
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,666
all the passengers to mask
the kidnapping of Chidori.

241
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,500
The bomb looks extremely
difficult to deactivate.

242
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,458
My equipment isn't good
enough to risk an attempt.

243
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:45,000
I understand. We will start
preparing a counter-measure.

244
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,500
[SOUSUKE]
Yes ma'am.

245
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,333
Listen, Sgt. At this point,
the safety of the passengers

246
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:53,666
is a greater priority
than Chidori's rescue.

247
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,916
[SOUSUKE]
Roger.

248
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,958
[SOUSKE]
Sir...

249
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,583
[KALININ]
Hm? What, Sgt.?

250
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:03,666
[SOUSUKE] The leader of
the hijackers... It's Gauron.

251
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,875
[TERRORIST]
Don't move.

252
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,916
[KALININ] He has assassinated
more than 30 VIPs,

253
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,625
and he's the man responsible
for two aircraft bombings.

254
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:23,875
At least, that we know of.

255
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,250
In short, a very dangerous man.

256
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,375
The last time we encountered
him, we had the KGB pursuing us.

257
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:35,041
Gauron was one of
their mercenaries.

258
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,666
One day while Sagara and I were
out on our respective patrols,

259
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,125
he attacked the guerilla
hideout with two Arm Slaves.

260
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,291
[KALININ]
There were no survivors.

261
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,625
And then what?

262
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,541
Together, Sagara and I
vowed to seek revenge.

263
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:55,166
An opportunity presented itself
to us two weeks later.

264
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:03,333
We set me up as the decoy,
and Sgt. Sagara as the sniper.

265
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,125
He shot Gauron.

266
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,416
But somehow he's still alive.

267
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,041
Yes, it would seem so.

268
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,000
He sounds like a
viciously cruel man.

269
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,208
I hate to say it, but we
couldn't have counted on him

270
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,833
releasing the hostages
from the start.

271
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,125
Right.

272
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,541
[TELETHA]
It's agreed then.

273
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,750
We need to make this Gauron
pay for his crimes in full.

274
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,750
[KALININ]
Yes, Madam Captain.

275
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,625
[TERRORIST]
Turn this way. Slowly.

276
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,416
Tell me, just who were
you communicating with?

277
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,750
Start talking now!

278
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,041
The person I was
communicating with...

279
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,541
[TERRORIST]
Hm?

[TERRORIST grunts]

282
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,750
Did you really think...
you could beat me...

283
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,500
...if I didn't have a weapon?!

284

[TERRORIST yelling]

285

D-Damn you...
Who... the hell are you?

286
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,208
I take out the garbage.

287
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,875
So how are you feeling?

288
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:40,958
[KANAME grunts]

289
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,916
Not too good.

290
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,375
[FEMALE DOCTOR]
Really? That's too bad.

291
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,666
We have a long way to go.

292
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,500
Please, let me go back home.

293
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,833
I don't think I can take
anymore of this sleep-learning.

294
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,416
[FEMALE DOCTOR]
Learning?

295
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,791
Don't be ridiculous.
This is something you've known

296
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,333
since before you
were born, Miss Chidori.

297
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,125
[KANAME gasps]

298
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,583
We need to move very
quickly on this mission.

299
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,916
[MELISSA]
Sorry we're late, sir.

300
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,333
We told the taxi to hurry!

301
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,333
[KURZ chuckles]

302
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,833
[KALININ]
Please pay attention.

303
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,041
This is the plan which we,
the crew of the Tuatha de Danaan

304
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,500
will carry out.

305
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,250
First, we will send each
respective AS support unit in

306
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,541
led by an AS team
comprised of six Arm Slaves.

307
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:21,666
Attack helicopters, transport
helicopters, then VTOL fighters.

308
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,125
[KALININ] The greatest
problem we will be facing

309
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,541
is the bomb located here,

310
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,625
which I suspect has a
remote control trigger.

311
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,250
It is utterly imperative
that we disarm the bomb

312
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,833
before the terrorists have
a chance to flip the switch

313
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:46,250
after they recover from the
shock of our initial attack.

314
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,750
[KALININ]
Once we start the operation,

315
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,416
these two UN transport planes

316
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,875
will land with our support,
accommodate the hostage group

317
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,625
from the jumbo jet,
and take off within 5 minutes.

318
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,375
What? In 5 minutes?!
That's not enough time!

319
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:08,500
5 minutes is an eternity to be
protecting a target that big.

320
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,041
What should we do if one of the
transport planes gets destroyed

321
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,583
while it's taking off?

322
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,916
Then accommodate as many
hostages as possible

323
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,958
in one of the
transport helicopters.

[KALININ] As a last resort,
you may ditch your AS.

325
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:24,500
But in that case, make sure
to destroy it completely.

326
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:28,250
This should take priority
over your lives.

327
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,875
We are the only ones in the
world who can make this mission

328
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,250
a success, so I'm
counting on each of you!

329
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,250
I want you to work to
the best of your ability!

330
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,458
Is that it?

[TELETHA] Any communication
from Mr. Sagara?

335
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,041
[KALININ]
Not yet.

336
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,041
I hope he's going to be
all right, Lt. Commander.

337
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,666
I mean, considering our enemy...

338
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,833
The one thing I can say is this:

339
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,958
As long as I've known him,

340
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,333
Sgt. Sagara has never let
his personal feelings

341
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,625
get in the way of his judgment.

Where did that shot come from?!

[HENCHMAN A] I don't know!
Was it from inside?!

[HENCHMAN B]
Let's go!

346
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,375
[HENCHMAN A]
Right!

Only the stupidest of amateurs

348
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,708
would go out at a
time like this...

00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,875
I'm a professional soldier!

350
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,208
Will this be like
those other times...?

351
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,791
I informed him
which of his duties

352
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,708
takes the higher priority.

353
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,208
He's a pro among pros.

What're you thinking, Sousuke?!

Even if you are a military buff,

you can't control

Right.
