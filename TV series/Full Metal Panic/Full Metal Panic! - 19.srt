1
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,250
[SOLDIER B]
Hm?

2
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:25,625
[SOLDIER A] It's time. C Craft
goes on standby starting now.

3
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:29,041
I'm handing the task of
cleaning the hangar over to you.

4
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,333
Roger that.

5
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,166
[chuckles]

6
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:50,875
Ah!

7
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,791
Melissa, you won't be
sick all over the place

8
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,208
drinking in this
hot bath, will ya?

9
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,833
'Course not. I'm fine.

10
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,750
The beer's non-alcoholic,

11
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,791
because it's right
before a mission,

12
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,333
and nobody on my crew
consumed any alcohol

13
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,208
during the party either.

14
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,666
Are ya sure?

15
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,708
A-ha!

16
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,750
It's non-alcoholic. It is.

17
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,041
[yawns]

18
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,500
It's still hard to
believe that they let you

19
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,833
put a bath in a submarine.

20
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,000
Originally, it was designed

21
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,166
for washing AS parts
with chemicals,

22
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,833
but when it's not in service,

23
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:37,958
I can commandeer it for
my own personal use.

24
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,791
[KANAME] Is-Is it safe
for people to go in?

25
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,791
Perfectly. This bath
is my pride and joy.

26
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,166
I imagine people who are
used to Japanese baths

27
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,625
may not feel like
a shower is enough.

28
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,375
I know, because I used to
live in Japan as a child,

29
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,875
and as a matter of fact,
so did Mr. Weber.

30
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,250
Oh, where'd you live?

31
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,333
Okinawa.

32
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,750
Really? Then where did...?

33
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,083
Something the matter?

34
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,875
No, it's just Sousuke.

35
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,333
I was wondering what
kinda kid he was.

36
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:09,083
Mr. Sagara back then...?

37
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,250
Well, to tell ya the truth,

38
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,083
I met those two
for the first time

39
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,791
somewheres around a year ago.

40
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,333
A year ago? Those two?

41
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,250
Let me see, if I
remember correctly,

42
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,291
it happened right after the
de Danaan's maiden voyage.

43
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,291
That means it's
been almost a year

44
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,041
since Urzu 6 and Urzu 7
joined the team.

45
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,750
[KANAME, TELETHA]
Mm-hm...

46
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,333
Oh, I don't know,
Captain Testarossa,

47
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,916
think it's all right
to tell a civilian?

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,541
Miss Kaname is a special case.

49
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,583
[laughs]

50
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,041
[sighs] It was around the time

51
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,125
when the first batch
of mass-produced M9's

52
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,000
were about to be
officially deployed.

53
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:49,125
[helicopter blades whirring]

54
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,750
[MELISSA]
Two members of our team

55
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:08,541
were disabled for active service
by an accident during training.

56
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,333
I was the one who
went to the trainees'

57
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,875
so-called tryout camp

58
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,916
to handpick the
replacement personnel.

59
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,833
Trainee?

60
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,916
You mean there was a time
when Sousuke was a rookie?

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,375
It's hard for me to
even imagine that.

62
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,583
Funny, somehow I can
imagine it just fine.

63
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,541
So what happened out there
at the trainee camp?

64
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,875
Well, the first one I found
to be a little naive,

65
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,166
but he was polite
and unsophisticated.

66
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,083
And oh, yeah, he was
also a terrible shot.

67
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:46,916
Huh. Sounds like the total
opposite of Kurz, huh?

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,333
Wait a minute!

69
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,958
[MELISSA] This trainee, Kurz
Weber, had a pretty cute face,

70
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:56,750
but one day, he approached me
when nobody was around.

71
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:01,041
[KURZ] Yeah. Everything I try,
I'm just no good at.

72
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:05,375
Even when it comes to something
as simple as holding a rifle.

73
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,083
Sergeant Major, I honestly
don't think I can stand

74
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,958
another minute in this
awful training camp.

75
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,291
[MELISSA] What is this guy,
some kind of wuss?

76
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:18,458
So, what I really need right
now, isn't more training,

77
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,958
but love.

78
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,375
I need the warmth of
someone close to me.

79
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,791
[MELISSA]
W-Wait!

80
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,875
Sergeant Major, please let
me cry on your chest.

81
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,958
I'm baring my soul to you!

82
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,083
Please bare...

83
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,208
[gasps, grunts]

84
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,958
[KURZ]
...your body!

85
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,458
[MELISSA yelps]

86
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,625
[MELISSA]
You asshole!

87
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,916
[KURZ groans]

88
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,333
Keep your hands to yourself.

89
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,750
[KANAME]
That is disgusting.

90
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,041
At that point, his name
promptly disappeared

91
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,458
from my short-list
of rookie candidates.

92
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:02,875
And Mr. Sagara?

93
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,791
[MELISSA]
Sousuke?

94
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,875
Uh, he really didn't
show up on my radar.

95
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,333
Huh?

96
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,583
[MELISSA] I had almost made up
my mind on three candidates

97
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:18,291
after careful study of
their performance data.

98
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,208
The first one was
Jonathan Hareru,

99
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,250
an ex-Israeli soldier
who held the best score.

100
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,750
Next was Rickarudo Plado,
an ex-Peruvian soldier.

101
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:30,666
And then a former Italian
soldier, Daniere Buriash.

102
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,500
If I had to choose now,
I'd pick two of them.

103
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,666
[MELISSA]
Then I noticed the results

104
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,375
of an AS simulation test,

105
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,625
where an old RK92
destroyed the M6 operated

106
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,000
by that Jonathan guy.

107
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,833
[MELISSA]
So who was operating the RK92?

108
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,000
Sousky Segal?

109
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,500
Well, that's a weird name.

110
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,041
Yeah, that's what
I thought, too.

111
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,500
His test scores weren't
all that great either.

112
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,541
In fact, there was nothing
outstanding about him

113
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,250
except that name.

114
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,500
Was it just random chance?

115
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,208
I couldn't really say.

116
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:13,833
So I took it upon
myself to find out.

117
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,708
Um, excuse me.

118
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,166
So am I right in guessing
that you're Sousky Segal?

119
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,333
Affirmative. Actually,
my name is pronounced

120
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,125
Sousuke Sagara, Ma'am.

121
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:37,416
Wait a minute, you are the
one who defeated Hareru's M6

122
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,000
with a Savage, aren't you?

123
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,458
That's right, I was lucky.

124
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,833
Uh-uh. That takes
more than dumb luck.

125
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,000
Then he must have
made some mistakes.

126
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,208
What a conversationalist.

127
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,333
Right. I was almost ready
to give up at that point,

128
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,125
but, as misfortune
would have it,

129
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,708
a certain idiot came
waltzing into the barracks.

130
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,916
You mean Mr. Weber, right?

131
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,250
[MELISSA] "Did you come here
to steal my underwear?"

132
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,708
That's what he said to me.

133
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,958
A higher ranking officer.

134
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:07,875
So you can guess how
easily I lost my temper.

135
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,416
Careful, Miss,
you'll get burned.

136
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,333
Why don't you
try me, little man?

137
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,083
[KURZ, MELISSA]
Ah--

138
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,041
That's enough from both of you.

139
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,791
[gasps]

140
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,125
[MELISSA]
Whoa, that was freaky.

141
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,625
How did he cover
all that distance?

142
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,291
Your name is Weber, isn't it?

143
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,166
Stop flirting with
the petty officer.

144
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,458
You may incite
the other soldiers.

145
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,041
Uh, okay.

146
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,625
[MELISSA] Two candidates I can
cross off my list for good.

147
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:55,166
Wow. The worst
introduction ever.

148
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,666
You're tellin' me!

149
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah. It sounds like them.

150
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,291
Yeah, no joke.

151
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:05,583
But honestly, it was nothing
compared to what happened next.

152
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,000
[PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER]
Uh, w-we're a group

153
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,291
of loyal revolutionaries.

154
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,833
Yesterday, we successfully

155
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,000
kidnapped the daughter
of the president,

156
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,250
a puppet dictator,
in a surprise raid.

157
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,041
If you want her back,
you need to pay

158
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:30,458
$5,121,076.52 immediately.

159
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,250
The price is not negotiable.

160
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,041
We will not discount
even a penny.

161
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,250
My, my. A bit exact, aren't we?

162
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,541
If you do not comply,
we cannot guarantee

163
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,500
the First Daughter's safety.

164
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,166
Today, she's wearing

165
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,375
a bunny girl costume,
as you can see.

166
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,791
But, who knows what
kind of clothes

167
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,708
we'll dress her
up in tomorrow...

168
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,875
maybe a geisha girl
or a samba dancer

169
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,625
from the Carnivale parade.

170
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,458
This is not a joke.
We're serious.

171
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:57,375
I don't like this,
Daddy, please hel--

172
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,916
What the hell was that?

173
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,708
[MILITARY GUY 2] The amount for
the ransom is rather exact.

174
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,083
Well, they must have
some kind of reason for it.

175
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,958
What exactly are
they serious about?

176
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,375
Everyone! I know the credibility

177
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,583
of this threat is
questionable at best,

178
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,541
but you must know that
maniac guerilla groups

179
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,250
cannot be measured by the
yardstick of commonsense.

180
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,750
We will carry out the mission

181
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,750
to rescue the hostage from these
hardline leftist guerillas

182
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,625
at the request of the
Berugan government.

183
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,333
Is that understood?

184
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,833
You're kidding.

185
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,041
I'm sorry, Melissa.

186

You'll have to finish the
story for me another time.

187
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,625
Serving as Captain
must be tough,

188
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,708
especially if you have to
be on call like that

189
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,625
even when you're taking a bath.

190

What do ya think?
Should we get outta here

191
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,333
and dry off before we
start feeling dizzy?

192
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,625
[KANAME]
Yeah.

193
00:11:58,583 --> 00:11:59,916
[gasps]

194
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,750
You'll have to finish the

195
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,791
[KANAME] If I leave now,
I don't know the next time

196
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,041
I'll get a chance
to hear this story.

197
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,375
Actually... I'd like
to hear some more.

198
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,375
Hey, as long as you feel okay.

199
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,333
Well, there weren't
enough instructors

200
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,916
at the camp to put
together a rescue squad.

201
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,041
So they started asking
around for trainees

202
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:22,000
to volunteer and provide
support on the mission.

203
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,458
Lemme guess.
Those two volunteered.

204
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,541
Yeah. They, of all people.

205
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,416
[GUY ON RADIO]
This is team Sapphire.

206
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,416
Things have gone South.
We're talkin' FUBAR.

207
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,375
What happened?

208
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,000
The enemies may have been...

209
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,833
...abnormal, but they
also had three AS's.

210
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,666
[MELISSA] The main group had
all become prisoners of war.

211
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,291
The only ones left
were the four of us

212
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,666
assigned to the rear.

213
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,208
Ma'am, we gotta withdraw.

214
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,583
Just four of us
against all of them

215
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,125
isn't gonna do anything.

216
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,708
Our best option now is
to retreat and regroup.

217
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,333
No. Regrouping
for another attack

218
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,750
would take too long.

219
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,041
Our enemies would
be better prepared

220
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,083
than we could ever hope to be.

221
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:20,958
[JIMMER]
But Ma'am--

222
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,041
Battles have an ebb and a flow.

223
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,541
Once you lose the flow,
that's the end of the battle,

224
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,041
and you get pulled
under the rising tide.

225
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,500
Right now, we still
have a chance.

226
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,083
So what's your
part in this plan?

227
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,333
[SOUSUKE]
Hm?

228
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,416
You must have something
up your sleeve, right?

229
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,041
Not as much as you've got.

230
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,916
[MELISSA] As I guessed.
You're hiding something from me.

231
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,583
So what is it?

232
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,791
[KANAME]
So, what did you do?

233
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,541
[MELISSA] Found out what
they were, of course.

234
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,458
A naive crook who,
quote unquote,

235
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,166
"couldn't hold a rifle right,"

236
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,375
And a guy who could get
mediocre scores on purpose.

237
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,791
This is Weber. I'm in position.

--[LEADER] What the...?

If you don't wanna die,

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,458
set the hostage free
and surrender quietly.

247
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,041
[MELISSA]
I have six AS's positioned

248
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,791
around the perimeter,
ready to open fire.

Give up and I'll
let you survive.

You want me to give up?
Are you stupid?

I'm going to call bullshit.

It's about one meter
out of place.

I'm talking about the
machine on your left side.

Can you get it to
move to the right?

I'll try.

You'll be the first to
fall under our fire.

I know, because I'm familiar

00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,625
with every type of AS,
and yours is too slow.

Not only the machine,
but the dumbass pilot as well.

319
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,875
[KANAME]
Wow.

320
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,625
[KANAME] Whoa. Of course,
it looks totally different

321
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,625
than when we had the party.

322
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,375
[SOUSUKE] Right. The submarine
is getting close

323
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,458
to the area of operation.

324
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,875
[KANAME]
Area of operation?

325
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:18,041
[SOUSUKE] Yes. A real operation
is about to commence.

326
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,500
[TELETHA]
Well, party time is over.

327
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,333
Is everyone ready for launch?

328
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,083
[MELISSA]
Sousuke's been acting strange.

329
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,291
I don't know if we can
beat these enemies.

330
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:08,833
[TELETHA]
Melissa...

331
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:11,916
[MELISSA] Next Full Metal Panic,
Episode 20: "Venom's Flame."

332
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,500
What's this feeling?

333
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,291
I have a bad hunch.
