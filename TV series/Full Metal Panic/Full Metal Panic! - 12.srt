I've got it!

Why don't we send Arbalest

00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,416

It would take an hour

Yes, I am.

[MARDUKAS] I didn't receive
your permission, Captain,

to launch in 3 minutes.

Somewhere with rougher terrain.

spare enough time

for the pilot to get in and
start it up after it lands.

It shouldn't be out in the open,
but downtown is no good either.

full use of its abilities.

Oh, ho! Ride 'em cowboy.

Is that it?

[KANAME]
Hm?

00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,291
I think I've seen that before.

[SOUSUKE]
It's no good.

169
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,708
It's a sitting duck.

It's not over yet.

No, not the break!

Once it stops, that's the end.

This is Urzu 7. I'm here.

taking you so long?

break the capsule.

can't crack the shell?!

Yes, that's affirmative.

I have one more grenade.

What did you say?

You wanna fight? Attack me?

[ARBALEST A.I.]
Yes, Sergeant.

242
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,875
So this machine must be
equipped with a Lambda Driver?

243
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,125
Am I right?

244
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,583
[ARBALEST A.I.]
Correct.

245
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,708
If we assume the enmy has
Lambda Driver capabilities,

246
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,291
is there any way we
can counter against it?

247
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,541
[ARBALEST A.I.]
Unknown.

As the site commander,
I demand to know.

[KANAME] Listen up.
I don't know the specifics,

256
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,833
but apparently there's
a cooling system

located near its groin.

...I think.

You think?

00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,125
[KANAME]
That's all I know, okay?

263
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,833
A regular attack won't work.

264
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,000
You have to use
the Lambda Driver.

You've got it, right?

266
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,666
Did the Captain tell you that?

You mean Tessa?

Um, maybe she did.
I'll just leave it at that.

Don't think of it as nonsense.

Concentrate my senses.

281
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,541
I will make it hit the target.

I'll destroy it!

It isn't fair. It just isn't.

Yes, you're right.
It really isn't fair.

anything left for me now.

thank you for your help.

the need to thank me,

Yeah, well, maybe later.

Huh?

Because... I'm utterly
exhausted at the moment.

But there is something
that I'd like

to get off my chest right away.

Wait, what are--

324
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,666
I think I may have
fallen in love

325
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,500
with our serious sergeant.

326
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,333
[KURZ]
Ooh! Oh, my!

327
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:57,833
--I... That is...I mean...
--[KURZ giggles]

328
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,875
Well then, now that
everyone's clear,

329
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:04,000
may the best woman win.
Fair enough?

330
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:07,625
[KURZ] Oh! Tessa and Sousuke
sittin' in a tree,

331
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:11,291
K-I-S-S-I-N-G...

332
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,250
[TELETHA]
Shall we withdraw now?

333
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,625
I heard that Mr. Kalinin
made it out safely.

334
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,333
[TELETHA]
Please, you have to listen.

335
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:01,708
Melissa's making fun of me.

336
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:02,875
[MELISSA]
You started it.

337
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,333
[TELETHA]
I can't take it anymore!

338
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,875
I challenge you to a duel.

339
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:08,083
[MELISSA] Fine with me.
I'll mop you up good.

340
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,291
[TELETHA gasps]

341
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:11,000
[SOUSUKE] Next Full
Metal Panic: Episode 13:

342
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,041
"A Cat and a Kitten's
Rock &amp; Roll."

343
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,375
This is starting to worry me.
