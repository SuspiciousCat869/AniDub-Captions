1
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,250
Why do I have this feeling

2
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,000
you're gonna be hungry again
10 minutes from now?

3
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,750
Crab bread is
really tasty, Kirie.

4
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,500
You want some, Yukinari?

5
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:59,416
Uh, no thanks. I'm okay.

6
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,833
Oh well.

7
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,791
Come on, time for gym class!

8
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,708
Gotta burn off that bread!

9
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,166
One more, Kirie.
I'll run extra laps!

10
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,500
Get goin', Tubby.

11
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:10,958
Girls are weird.

12
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,166
I want crab bread.

13
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,833
You're gonna explode
if you eat any more.

14
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,000
[MACHIDA] Hold on!

15
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,708
Just where do you
think you're going?

16
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,000
This school is a sacred place.

17
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:30,333
How dare you sully it
with your garbage?!

18
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,291
Okay. Who is that person?

19
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:38,208
He's just some nutcase.

20
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,166
You want to know my name?
So be it!

21
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,208
Okay then.
See ya 'round, Klingon.

22
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,000
Hey! Gimme a second.

23
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,375
Just a little equipment trouble.

24
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,208
As long as there's
trash in the world,

25
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,833
and as long as I draw breath,

26
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:04,541
I'll be there to make sure
it gets thrown away!

27
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,375
Sworn protector
of Mizuno High School,

28
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:11,541
Lightning Cleaning
Squadron, Mamo-ranger!

29
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,625
We should go.

30
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,833
Good idea.

31
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,541
Don't you need
more than one person

32
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,958
to make a squadron?

33
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,916
Hold on!

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,875
What are you going to
do about this wrapper?

35
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,208
Oh.

36
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,041
We'll be more careful
from now on, so...

37
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,750
Look at this wrapper!

38
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,958
It's not gonna grow hands
and throw itself away!

39
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,333
You found the damn thing!

40
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,333
If it bugs you so much,
throw it away yourself...

41
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,791
Mamo-dork!

42
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,000
How dare you!

43
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,083
Still refuse to admit
your wrong-doing?

44
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,291
Fine! Face the
awesome sucking power

45
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,333
of the Lightning Mamo-vacuum!

46
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,375
Litter vanquished!

47
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,000
All in a day's work
for the sworn protector

48
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,500
of Mizuno High School,
Mamo-ranger!

49
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,875
Hey, wait!

50
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,375
What is it already?

51
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,041
Repent villains!

52
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,541
How can you not care about
the future of our planet?

53
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:12,041
The wrapper's gone!

54
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,416
Litter vanquished, okay?

55
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,708
Ah, I thought I could
open your eyes to the truth,

56
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:15,833
but oh well.

57
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,750
You're all too far gone.

58
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:22,750
Suffer the pine-scented
wrath of Mamo-ranger!

59
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,541
What are you doing, you pervert?

60
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:31,125
I'm just taking out the garbage.

61
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,875
What's wrong Mamo-vacuum?

62
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:39,125
I dare you to do that again--

63
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,750
Mamoru Machida!

64
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:41,916
Who're you?

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,375
Being president of
the cleaning committee

66
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,333
doesn't give you the
right to terrorize people!

67
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,250
Take off that mask this instant!

68
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:53,250
What are you doing? Stop it!

69
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,791
Once the hero is unmasked,
his only solace is death.

70
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,750
Miharu, are you all right?

71
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:02,083
Oh, uh, yeah.

72
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,250
I'm glad.

73
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,083
I'll be in my hidden
fortress if you need me.

74
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,125
Not so fast!

75
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,750
We're taking a trip
to the guidance office.

76
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,916
It just isn't fair!

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I did all this for
Mizuno High School,

78
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,375
and this is the thanks I get?

79
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,833
Spare me the theatrics.

80
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,125
Oh man. Ms. Hijiri runs
a pretty tight ship.

81
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,875
Ms. Hijiri?

82
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,666
Uh-huh! That was Ms. Hijiri.

83
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,666
She arrived at the beginning
of the second term.

84
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,416
Rumor has it,
she'll drag students

85
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,708
down to the guidance office

86
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,291
and scold them
for almost anything.

87
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,875
Poor Mr. Moo Moo-ranger.

88
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,666
If I had thrown away that
wrapper like I was supposed to,

89
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,333
he wouldn't be in
any trouble right now.

90
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,666
It's not your fault, Miharu.

91
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,666
He's right.
Don't sweat it, okay?

92
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:53,541
She thinks she's so smart
putting me on clean-up duty.

93
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,875
That's not a punishment.

94
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,875
More like a reward...

95
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,250
Why don't people
clean up after themselves?

96
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,041
You think I'm gonna
give up just like that?

97
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,125
I'll never abandon my quest
to turn Mizuno High School

98
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:15,833
into an antiseptic
paradise. Mamo-ranger!

99
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,916
It's that boy from before.

100
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,333
Problem solved.

101
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,708
How dare you crap on me!

102
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,583
Excuse me.

103
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:30,750
Huh?

104
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,708
So we meet again,
Little Miss Crab-breath.

105
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,416
Attacking me
before I've had a chance

106
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,250
to transform into
Mamo-ranger is totally uncool!

107
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,041
I'm sorry about earlier.

108
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,333
You just want me to let my guard
down so you can finish me off.

109
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,541
Mr. Moo Moo-ranger you wanna
keep the school clean, right?

110
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,666
Right! Now leave me alone!

111
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,625
I'd like to
introduce you to someone,

112
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,333
to make up for this morning.

113
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,208
Introduce me to someone?

114
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,916
Uh-huh!

115
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,458
Miss Lilica!

116
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,666
Hello there.

117
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,375
Sorry to interrupt
your cleaning.

118
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,375
Is this young man
a friend of yours?

119
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,666
Yes. I'd like you
to meet Moo Moo-ranger.

120
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,125
Mamo-ranger.

121
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,583
Moo Moo-ranger meet Miss Lilica.

122
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:22,333
She cleans Fukuyama's whole
mansion every single day!

123
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,208
Isn't that amazing?

124
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,083
So, what is it that you need?

125
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,833
Well, you see...

126
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:32,875
we wanna know how to
make the school cleaner!

127
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,916
I thought maybe you could
share your cleaning secrets.

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,666
Hey, what's the big idea?

129
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,041
I don't mean to be impolite,

130
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,875
but Moo Moo here has
been fighting every day

131
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,208
to try to keep our school clean.

132
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:48,208
He calls himself a squadron,
but it's just him.

133
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:49,916
Thanks Crab-breath.

134
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,333
It's so brave how Moo Moo

135
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,333
tries to keep the school
clean by himself.

136
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,333
Can you teach him?

137
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,833
Let me get this straight,

138
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:00,166
day after day you've been
fighting grime all by yourself?

139
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,666
That's right! And I'll
never rest until it's gone!

140
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,666
A dirty school is worse
than no school at all!

141
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,791
I'll scrub those floors
'til my last breath!

142
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,166
'Til your last breath...

143
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:19,875
Tell me, is this
the path you've chosen?

144
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,750
Are you truly prepared to defend
those ideals, no matter what?

145
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,333
Uh, yeah!

146
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,125
So be it.

147
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,125
You'll help?

148
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,541
Meet me downtown at midnight.

149
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,666
You've much to learn,
my disciple.

150
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,166
Wow. You're
really lucky Moo Moo.

151
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,833
Uh, Moo Moo?

152
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:55,291
Well, well...
a careless smoker.

153
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,333
How would you deal
with such a man?

154
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,375
I'd give him a warning?

155
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:04,708
Pointless!

156
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,166
[Smoker] Stop! I can't breathe!

157
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,958
Why did you do that?

158
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,375
[Smoker] Huh? What do you mean?

159
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,375
You shouldn't toss your
cigarettes on the ground.

160
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,833
It's not healthy.

161
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,750
[Smoker] No, I'm sorry.
It's just one cigarette.

162
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:23,041
[Smoker] I'll never do
it again! I promise!

163
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,750
The ideals you hold most dear
mean nothing to your enemies.

164
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,541
If you cannot win them over
to your way of thinking,

165
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,791
you must annihilate them.

166
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,083
Of course, Master!

167
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,500
Tell me, what's wrong
with this picture?

168
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:51,333
Here in Mizuno,
non-combustible garbage

169
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:55,083
is supposed to be placed
in transparent trash bags.

170
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:59,291
There's all sorts of
non-combustible garbage in here.

171
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:04,291
Right the wrong
that stands before you.

172
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,333
Yeah! Just leave it to me.

173
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:10,666
Um, newspapers
and magazines, okay.

174
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,125
And these milk packs
are recyclable also.

175
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:16,833
Cardboard boxes are okay
if they're not waxed.

176
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:22,375
This one's a no-brainer.

177
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:27,541
Envelopes with plastic windows
are waste paper, not recyclable.

178
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,791
They're only fit for burning.

179
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,708
Master, this trash is
within the legal size limit.

180
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:38,916
I don't get it.

181
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,333
Ah!

182
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:44,333
Things aren't always as
they seem. Uncover the truth.

183
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,666
How did my master know?

184
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,166
Her instincts are
just out of this world!

185
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,791
You've had enough
training for one night.

186
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,875
But what should I do
with this giant tanuki?

187
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,166
Reflect on the
mysteries of recycling,

188
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:05,041
and the question
will answer itself.

189
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,250
All right, Master.

190
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,166
What's up, Miharu?

191
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,583
Yeah, you're all
smiles this morning.

192
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,666
It's a brand new day,

193
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,583
and I already know
it's gonna be wonderful.

194
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,083
Say, Miharu...
you're not just happy

195
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,041
because you can eat more
crab bread are you?

196
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,583
Un-unh. I'm too
excited to be hungry.

197
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,458
I can't wait
to get to school.

198
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,125
You'll see.
Everybody will be so happy.

199
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,250
So tell us. Come on.

200
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,625
I don't wanna
spoil the surprise.

201
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:51,291
Huh. Hey, buncha slobs.

202
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,125
What was that?

203
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,333
So long as the
world has garbage,

204
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,708
and trash does
its maximum harm-age,

205
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,916
and people keep littering
because they're stupid

206
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,833
and don't think about
the consequences-age,

207
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,416
why stop here when I can
clean the whole universe?

208
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,333
Lightning Cleaning
Squadron Mamo-ranger!

209
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,500
Commander Mamo-Red reporting for
duty.

210
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:21,583
Wow.

211
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,541
Still can't be a
squadron by yourself.

212
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,333
Lightning Squadron Mamo-ranger.

213
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,000
Who's alone now?

214
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,833
Your puppets are cool!

215
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,333
Oh, Master, I stayed
up all night long

216
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,041
making this new costume.

217
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,958
You taught me well,

218
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,625
and I'm ready to put
your wisdom into practice.

219
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,166
Stupid crow!

220
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,125
Watch out, Miharu!

221
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,958
If you can't win them over...
you must annihilate them!

222
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:00,000
I kind of miss
the Lightning Mamo-vacuum.

223
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,000
Good morning, everyone.

224
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,791
Why are you all crouching?

225
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,750
What the hell is going on?!

226
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,958
Look! On the roof!

227
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,375
Mamoru Machida's
lost his marbles.

228
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,375
Machida? That nerd?

229
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,625
Maybe something happened while
he was training with Lilica.

230
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:19,958
Lilica?

231
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,958
What did you just say?
It all makes sense.

232
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:26,083
Lilica asked if she
could go out last night.

233
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,041
If I'd only known...

234
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,833
Uh, Fukuyama?

235
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:34,208
If Lilica actually trained
Machida to be her protégé,

236
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,041
we should start
wetting ourselves now.

237
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,125
What?

238
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,416
W-What do you mean?

239
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,875
Outta ammo? Hmm?

240
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,333
Hmm, I wonder
where everyone went.

241
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:58,500
Well, at least I can do
my witchcraft in peace.

242
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,250
Here goes nothin'.

243
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,500
Oh mighty Mabanya, so long
as I have his Killty doll,

244
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,208
let me have
Yukinari's heart as well!

245
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,291
Don't move.

246
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,208
Excuse me,
I'm kind of in the middle

247
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,541
of something
important right now.

248
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,000
Quiet!

249
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,125
All you're doing
is making a mess!

250
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,625
Yeah, yeah, I'll clean
it up when I'm finished.

251
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,750
Smoke damage is
no laughing matter!

252
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,166
Do you have
any idea how long

253
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,958
it'll take to get
this place clean?!

254
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,625
No? 'Cause I do!

255
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,666
Blah blah blah, leave me alone!

256
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,000
Shut up!

257
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,458
Right, no ammo.

258
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,708
I'm so scared. Now go away.

259
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,208
Don't make fun of me!

260
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,041
The battle has just begun!

261
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,958
Lightning! Mamo-slugger!

262
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,541
Aww, bummer.

263
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,333
Look what you did to my crystal
ball, you jerk!

264
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,833
It's because you moved, stupid!

265
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,583
[KILLTY] Kill you.

266
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,333
Kill you.

267
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:02,750
Isn't that...

268
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,875
Machida must have tangled with
Lisa's magic.

269
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:09,166
Fine then, Lisa and Lilica are
both your problems, Fukuyama.

270
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,083
Do something about it!

271
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,333
Like hell!

272
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,500
We're talking about a magic
wielding ditz

273
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:15,833
and a trained killer!

274
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,375
If you think I'm interfering,

275
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,166
you're dumber than I thought!

276
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,041
If you didn't let them do
whatever they damn well please,

277
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:24,625
none of this would've happened!

278
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,916
There's just...
no pleasing you, is there?

279
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,125
What do we do?!

280
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,666
It'll destroy the school
if we don't stop it!

281
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,250
What are you
talking about? We?

282
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,000
This is all your fault!

283
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,166
Uh-unh! Well maybe a bit!

284
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,625
Killty smash!

285
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,333
Kill you!

286
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,750
I think that Killty doll's

287
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:55,125
gotten way too big
for his britches!

288
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,208
Lemme check how to stop him.

289
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,583
Uh.

290
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,125
You have to check the book?!

291
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,541
All right! I don't
know if this'll work,

292
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:06,458
but it's a chance
I'm gonna have to take!

293
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,666
Mamo-ranger final weapon...

294
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,000
Go!

295
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,583
Now what?

296
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,208
I've had about all
the weirdness I can take!

297
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,625
Hey! Up there!

298
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,208
When Mamo-Red's in a pinch,

299
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,875
he summons his final weapon
from its underground hangar!

300
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,458
The Lightning Mamo-machinedar!

301
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,916
Mamo-machinedar, get it?

302
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,333
'Cause it sounds
like my name, kinda...

303
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:47,750
Master Lilica, I've finally
thought of a way to recycle it.

304
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:01,208
Killty wins!

305
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,583
My depth perception sucks!

306
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,916
Wow! You showed
that tanuki who's boss.

307
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,125
I was only trying
to protect the school.

308
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,541
I wouldn't expect someone
like you to understand.

309
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,208
Really?
Then how come it looks like

310
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,250
a garbage dump right now?

311
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:19,000
Look around, dummy.

312
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,125
The school is completely
trashed thanks to you.

313
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:25,041
And your costume is completely
unoriginal, so there.

314
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,041
Huh?

315
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,041
Why can't I do anything right?

316
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,416
Mamoru!

317
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,041
Mamoru!

318
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,208
[LITTLE MAMORU] Yeah?

319
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,958
I'm here, Mama!

320
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,666
Turning off the water's
too hard for you?

321
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,041
I'm sorry.

322
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,416
You can just go to bed hungry!

323
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,541
But first...

324
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,458
Please, Mama, forgive me.

325
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,916
Who am I kidding? I'm useless!

326
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,958
So, you're running away.

327
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:06,083
Master Lilica, why'd you come?

328
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,333
Then all that was just a lie?

329
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,208
Huh?

330
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,458
You told me you were prepared

331
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,541
to defend your
ideals no matter what.

332
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,791
What happened to that
indomitable spirit?

333
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:20,416
I'm useless. It's true.
My mom told me so.

334
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,750
I thought wearing this mask
would help.

335
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,583
Maybe wearing it would help me
change for the better,

336
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,375
maybe I could be like one of
those cool heroes

337
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,833
I admired so much when I was a
kid.

338
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:35,208
It was a good idea, but I-I'm
not...

339
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,291
Look at me.

340
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,500
Huh?

341
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:44,708
Hey! What was that for?

342
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,583
M-M-M-Master!

343
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,458
Those scars...

344
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,458
They're from my time
in Bosnia and Chechnya,

345
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,375
Afghanistan, Somalia...

346
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:03,708
I've been sent out on
assignments all over the world.

347
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,208
No matter how dire the
situation,

348
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,333
no matter how slim the odds,

349
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,333
I always found a way to prevail.

350
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,916
I'm so sorry, my Master.

351
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,083
If you really believe in keeping
the school clean, fight for it.

352
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,375
'Til your last breath.

353
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,708
Okay.

354
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,708
It doesn't matter that
you're a squadron of one.

355
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,083
Uh-huh.

356
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:33,708
As long as you fight
for what you know is right,

357
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:37,291
you're already a hero.

358
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,333
Kill you!

359
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,791
Nice knowing you two.

360
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,500
Hold on!

361
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,041
[Everyone] Machida!

362
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,416
It's Moo Moo!

363
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,541
No! I am Mamo-ranger,
Lightning Cleaning Squadron!

364
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:04,541
Mamo-ranger!

365
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,708
Kiss my ass!

366
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:10,708
Machida!

367
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,166
Go Moo Moo!

368
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,958
Lightning! Mamo-broom!

369
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,291
Huh?

370
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:26,875
Where's Moo Moo?

371
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,250
Is he all right?

372
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,625
Ah!

373
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:43,875
He's okay! Oh Moo Moo-ranger!

374
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:53,875
He's okay! Oh Moo Moo-ranger!

375
00:21:53,958 --> 00:22:03,875
He's okay! Oh Moo Moo-ranger!

376
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:13,875
He's okay! Oh Moo Moo-ranger!

377
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:23,916
He's okay! Oh Moo Moo-ranger!

378
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:33,916
He's okay! Oh Moo Moo-ranger!

379
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:43,916
He's okay! Oh Moo Moo-ranger!

380
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:53,916
He's okay! Oh Moo Moo-ranger!

381
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:03,958
He's okay! Oh Moo Moo-ranger!

382
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:13,958
He's okay! Oh Moo Moo-ranger!

383
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:25,500
He's okay! Oh Moo Moo-ranger!

384
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,916
That stupid witch!
How could we have tied?

385
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,500
Actually, I won,
but who's keeping track, right?

386
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,916
What? Let's have a
rematch next episode.

387
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,333
I'll show you who's best!

388
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:35,666
Sorry, no time.

389
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,083
Next episode is all about
Tomoka and Big Brother.

390
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,833
Um, don't freak out,
but you're not even in it.

391
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:41,916
What?!

392
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,041
Girls Bravo Season Two,
next episode,

393
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,791
"As Long As We're
Together Then Bravo!"

394
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,750
Wait! Don't I come back again?

395
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:50,083
I made this
costume for nothing?!
