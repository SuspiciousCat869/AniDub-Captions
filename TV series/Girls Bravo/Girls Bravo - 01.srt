My name is Yukinari Sasaki.

I know I look pretty young,

39
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:15,416
but I'm a sophomore
at Mizuno high school.

I was born on March 31st,

Or so I thought.

47

But since I'm so short,

Over time, I developed
such a strong fear of girls

that I'd break out into
a rash whenever one came near!
