00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,416
[YUKINARI] Miharu, hurry up,
we're going to be late!

2
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,750
[KIRIE] Our teacher'll kill us

00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:10,125
if we're tardy to writing
class again. Come on.

4
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,458
[MIHARU] But I'm still in
the middle of eating breakfast.

5
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,583
[YUKINARI] It's okay. Let's go.

6
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:18,166
[MIHARU] Oh, sorry, breakfast.
Nothing personal.

[KOYOMI panting]

10
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,583
[KOYOMI] Uh, this is... 

11
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,708
[KIRIE] We're here!

12
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,625
I can't believe it.
It just started pouring!

13
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,541
Now we're all wet.

14
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,000
But I thought
the weatherman said

15
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,791
it wasn't
supposed to rain today.

16
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,083
Like you can go
off what they say.

17
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,833
Hey Yukinari,
I got dibs on the tub.

18
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,166
Sure.

19
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,500
Miharu, why don't you...

20
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:20,291
M-M-M-M-Miharu, what are you
doing taking your clothes off?

21
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,333
It's really chilly
in these wet clothes,

22
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,291
so I'd like to
take a bath, too.

23
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay, but could you
please do it in there?

24
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,583
I'm sorry, Yukinari, but...

25
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:32,333
...could you help me out
of my clothes, please?

26
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,916
[KIRIE] Yukinari...

27
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,041
Cool off, you little perv!

28
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,166
[MIHARU] Yukinari!

29
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,250
I'm sure the little
pervert will be fine.

30
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,708
Come on,
let's take our bath.

31
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,750
[front door closes]

32
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,166
[KIRIE and MIHARU scream]

33
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,083
[YUKINARI gasps]

34
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,375
Hey, what's wrong?

35
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,625
[KIRIE] Get out of here,
you sleazeball!

36
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:06,833
Dumbass.

37
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,500
[MIHARU] Uh, Kirie...

38
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,208
I didn't hit him that hard.

39
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,375
Besides, that's
the only way he'll learn.

40
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,958
Okay, but what about...

41
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,291
Oh yeah, huh.

42
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,000
We've got a problem,
Yukinari.

43
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,916
Yeah, no kidding.

44
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,416
A girl?

45
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,916
[KIRIE] Yeah.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,708
We looked in the tub
and there she was, out cold.

47
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,500
She was...
in my bathtub?

48
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,666
[MIHARU] Yeah.

49
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,458
I'll take her
to the living room.

50
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:37,583
Wait, Yukinari,
what about your allergy?

51
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,166
Hey, I'll be okay.

52
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,708
You two should hurry up
and take your bath now.

53
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:45,375
After all, you'll catch a cold
if you stay wet too long.

54
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,916
[CHILD KOYOMI] Hey Daddy?

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,541
The planet that you came from,
tell me what it's like.

56
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,875
[KOYOMI'S DAD] If it weren't
raining today, you could see it.

57
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,416
[KOYOMI sighs]
Okay.

58
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,500
I wanna go visit
Earth someday.

59
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,125
Someday it is, then.
You can go.

60
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,416
Really? Really?

61
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,791
We'll go there together,
Daddy? It's a promise?

62
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,458
Sure.

63
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,750
It's a promise.

64
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,666
[KOYOMI] No!

[KOYOMI panting]

66
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,666
Excuse me, but...

67

...are you okay?

68

Huh?

69
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,208
No!

Hey, wait, what did I do?

71
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,458
What?

72

Ow.

Where'd she go?

[alarm goes off]

77
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,625
[YUKINARI]
Pretty neat, huh?

78
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,708
You can record
stuff onto it.

79
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,916
Geez, don't freak
her out anymore!

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,166
But, I was just
trying to be nice.

81
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,750
It's okay, just wait over there.

82

Now then, are
you feeling better?

83
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,166
Mm-hmm.

84
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:49,625
I wanna ask you a few things...
if that's all right.

85
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:54,666
Oh yeah. Your clothes.
I washed 'em for you.

86

What's the matter?
Are you okay?

87
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,208
Oh, uh, yes.

these right here then.

You're lucky, Koyomi.
It's a really lovely name.

Thank you.

Hey, uh, why don't you
give me your phone number?

TV show?

My favorite TV show is called
"Have Stomach Will Travel."

113

It's a reality show!

114

They go traveling
all over Japan

tracking down different

116
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,541
kinds of rare or weird
or yummy well-known dishes.

117

When I watch it,

118
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,708
I get really excited
about all the tasty food

had a chance to try.

is very energetic.

favorite show, right?

But seriously, all you
remember about yourself

is your own name?

Where the hell'd
you come from?

The weather cleared up,

135
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,125
so I thought maybe I could
convince you and Miharu

136

to spend the afternoon
having some naughty fun.

to this peasant hovel.

such a delicious
young beauty within it.

Her loss of
memory is your gain.

render her immune to

00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,416
my father's planet.

324
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,041
Are you saying...
you're from--

325
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:51,083
Your little speech
gave me goosebumps, Koyomi.

326
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:51,875
[YUKINARI Fukuyama!]
[KOYOMI gasps]

327
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,500
Fancy meeting you here.

328
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,875
I've been looking
all over for you.

329
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,791
Oh. Walking around
in such a skimpy outfit

330
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,625
could give men the wrong idea.

331
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:07,208
Isn't it about
time we head home?

332
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,166
Stop it already, Fukuyama!

333
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,333
What's your problem, Puny-nari?

334
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,625
Can't you see
she doesn't like you?

335
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,416
Just stop bugging her already!

336
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,791
You've got moxie,
but seriously now...

337
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,833
what could you
possibly do to me?

338
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,666
Oh...

339
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,541
Koyomi, run for it!

340
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,208
Okay!

341
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,083
Puny-nari, you dare
exploit my weakness

342
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,333
to steal my woman?!

343
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,208
Take this you
ballsy little freak!

344
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,708
[YUKINARI and KOYOMI yelp]

345
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,958
[KOYOMI thinks]
The star mark.

346
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:53,083
That's it! I remember!

347
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,958
[NANAE] The subject
is Miharu Sena Kanaka.

348
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:01,416
She disappeared from her
bathroom about a month ago now.

349
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,583
We have reason to
think she's on Earth.

350
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,708
I want you to bring her
back to Seiren...

351
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:10,541
before the Special Forces
ladies start butting in.

352
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,333
Can I count on you, Koyomi?

353
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,208
Yes.

354
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:19,000
The crystalized Aqua Lamp
will only give you a 36-hour

355
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,583
window of opportunity in
which to complete your mission.

356
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,291
If you exceed
that 36-hour limit,

357
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,333
you won't be able
to return to Seiren.

358
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,208
Do you understand?

359
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,250
Perfectly, Captain.

360
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,458
K-Koyomi!

361
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,000
Koyomi?

362
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,125
[FUKUYAMA smirks]

363
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,625
Your landing could use
some work, Puny-nari.

364
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,375
Dammit!

365
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,166
You managed to outwit me,
if only for a moment.

366
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,416
I underestimated you,

367
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,833
but it's time to separate
the men from the boys.

368
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,541
Come on, Koyomi.

369
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,708
I'll make your first night
on Earth a memorable one.

370
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,958
And by memorable,
I mean nasty!

371
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,750
[FUKUYAMA laughs]

372
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:10,833
[KIRIE] Go be nasty...
in Hell!

373
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,250
Hey Kirie.

374
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,916
[MIHARU]
Yukinari!

375
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,583
Miharu!

376
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,791
Hi, Koyomi.

377
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,750
But where's Fukuyama?

378
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,875
[KIRIE] I'm sure he's having
a memorable time right now.

379
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,416
And by memorable,
I mean unconscious.

380
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,666
Oh, that sounds like fun.

381
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,833
I guess that means Yukinari won
our game of Earth tag, right?

382
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,083
Uh...

383
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:41,708
[KIRIE laughs]
Yeah, Yukinari won all right.

384
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,291
[MIHARU, KIRIE,
and YUKINARI laugh]

385
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,916
[KOYOMI]
I remember...

386
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,791
What I'm supposed to do.

387
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,416
[MIHARU] All of that running
around made me hungry.

388
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,791
[KIRIE] Yeah, me too.
How 'bout you, Yukinari?

389
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,666
[YUKINARI] I think I could
eat a horse right now!

390
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,333
[KOYOMI] I'm supposed to...
