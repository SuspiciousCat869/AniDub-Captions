1
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,375
My name is Kazuharu Fukuyama.

2
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,458
I'm the finest man
at Mizuno High School.

3
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,375
No, the finest
man in the world!

4
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:10,000
Between being heir of
the super-rich Fukuyama family,

5
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,125
and my stunning good looks,

6
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,375
the women should fall
at my feet, and usually do.

7
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,708
But there are still some

8
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,875
who don't fathom
my universal appeal.

9
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,291
There's Miharu,

10
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,666
the naïve beauty who is
hungrier than she is smart,

11
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,458
and Kirie, who
hides her love for me

12
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:27,125
under her violent
top-heavy exterior.

13
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,291
There's also the
fragile and shy Koyomi,

14
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,291
and Tomoka,
the precocious child,

15
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,833
and my darling Ebi

16
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,750
who can be changed into
the cutest little girl ever!

17
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,500
First I have to deal
with that wuss, Puny-nari,

18
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:42,000
who lives with them all and
who's even bewitched my sister!

19
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:47,791
Then I can focus on my dream:
an all-girl paradise on Earth!

20
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:52,583
Until then,
keep your eyes on me!

21
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,250
This baseball
game's gonna rock!

22
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,750
I still can't believe
that Fukuyama gave us tickets

23
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,083
to the stadium
in the first place.

24
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,500
He said it's to make up
for acting like such a dumbass,

25
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,541
but that'll
take season tickets.

26
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:48,583
Wow! It's huge!

27
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:52,541
It's so enormous!

28
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,375
Yeah, and it looks
just like melon bread!

29
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,250
Kind of, but that
would be a lot of bread!

30
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,500
Yeah, this is the heart and
soul of Japanese pro baseball!

31
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:04,666
The Tokyo Gigantes
home stadium! Ta-da!

32
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,166
Fukuyama Dome.

33
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,416
It's the biggest
covered stadium in Asia.

34
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,750
It holds up to 55,0000 people!

35
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,583
Now if only it
weren't named after

36
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,458
my least favorite person
in the whole world.

37
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,125
Oh.

38
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:20,958
Hey, what do you mean,
"Oh"? This is "Oh," huh?

39
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,666
Get real!
This is where Matsuki hits,

40
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,000
Kiyoharu yells,

41
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,000
and Shitahara
throws fastballs!

42
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,416
It's practically
hallowed ground!

43
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,958
Seriously, have you ever seen

44
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,750
a more impressive
building in your life?

45
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,416
This took 3 years
and 35 billion yen to build!

46
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,875
Oh. 35 billion yen. Okay.

47
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,125
Miharu, a bunch of bananas

48
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,541
usually costs
around 200 yen, okay.

49
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:46,708
Okay.

50
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,250
So with 35 billion yen,

51
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:52,250
a person could buy
about 15,000 tons of bananas.

52
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,750
15,000 tons of bananas, okay.

53
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,166
And those elephants
we saw at the zoo

54
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,291
weighed about 5 tons each.

55
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,208
If Fukuyama's family took
the money they spent on this,

56
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,041
and gave it to you instead,

57
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,166
you could eat an
elephant's worth of bananas

58
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,208
every day for
the next 57 years!

59
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,833
An elephant's worth
of bananas for 57 years!

60
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,000
That is amazing!

61
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,333
All it takes is
the right explanation.

62
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:20,916
Geez, and people treat me
like I'm a little kid?

63
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,875
Gate F. Yeah, this is it.

64
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,416
Do we really
have to go in there?

65
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,958
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

66
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,541
Koyo's right. That dumb
pervert is up to something.

67
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,750
Yeah, are we even sure there's
a baseball game scheduled today?

68
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,250
What's gotten into you guys.

69
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,208
We're talking about Matsuki
and Kiyoharu and Shitahara!

70
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,750
Fine! I'll go by my damn self!

71
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,083
Kirie, hold on!

72
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,291
Well, it's about time.
I was starting to think--

73
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:08,125
Don't just pop up out of
nowhere! It makes me nervous!

74
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,125
And so you start swinging?

75
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,541
Hitting people isn't a very
good coping mechanism, Kirie.

76
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,500
What's going on here, Fukuyama?

77
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,083
I better see some
baseball pretty damn quick!

78
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:22,958
Baseball? Who said anything
about a baseball game?

79
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,833
Fine! Then what are
these  tickets for?

80
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:29,250
Hey, what's happening?

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,208
Judging from its exterior,

82
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,000
you'd be right to
think the Fukuyama Dome

83
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:40,708
only hosts mundane
events like baseball games.

84
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,375
Huh? But I thought that this
place only went two levels deep!

85
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:49,291
Officially it does, but we
hold the main event down here.

86
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,666
Once a year, women come to
the Dome from around the globe.

87
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,041
They put their strength
and honor on the line

88
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:58,916
as they pair off to face
each other in unarmed combat.

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,708
These brave women risk life and
limb in their quest for glory.

90
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:08,250
It's just another day
here at Girls Fight.

91
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,708
That must hurt a lot.

92
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:30,041
Hey, aren't those women
on the All Japan Judo Team?

93
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,500
The fact that they're on
the Judo Team means nothing.

94
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,875
Here at Girls Fight, they're
just a pair of rank amateurs.

95
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,958
Only the strong
survive and move on.

96
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,250
That's the key to working one's
way up the Fukuyama ranking.

97
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,083
The Fukuyama ranking?

98
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,541
What are you babbling about?

99
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,291
Funny you should ask!

100
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:52,291
The Fukuyama ranking is the gold
standard for women fighters.

101
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,166
And yours truly
came up with the idea!

102
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,083
Equal parts fighting
prowess and physical beauty.

103
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,625
On the one side,
there's the eye candy,

104
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,000
on the other there's
the girl power angle.

105
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,958
T&amp;A... combat...
who could ask for anything more?

106
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:09,166
It doesn't mean anything,

107
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,833
it's just you
stroking your own ego again.

108
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,458
We came here for nothing.

109
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,958
Let's go home.

110
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,208
I'm really glad I got
to see the Banana Dome.

111
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,708
We should grab some
lunch on the way home.

112
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,666
So, care to try
your luck, Kirie?

113
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,291
Well, what do you say?
Your violence is--

114
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,791
Keep dreaming, dumbass.
I'm not doing this.

115
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,541
For God's sakes, Kirie,

116
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,583
are you just going to randomly
punch me all day long?

117
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:39,125
Don't worry, I'm gonna
kick you a few times, too!

118
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,958
You leave me no choice.

119
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,000
Remember this?

120
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:48,000
Hey, you! Gimme that!

121
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,541
A picture's worth
a thousand words.

122
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,208
B-But how did you
get that photograph?

123
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:57,708
You obviously underestimate
what the Fukuyama family can do.

124
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:01,000
Your private lives are
mine to exploit and enjoy!

125
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:06,416
If you enter into my
Girls Fight tournament and win,

126
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,166
I'll give this back to you.

127
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,583
But if you
refuse to compete...

128
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,750
well... you get
my drift, Kirie.

129
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:19,458
Um, Kirie, are you sure you
wanna go through with this?

130
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,166
It's not like I have a choice.

131
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,208
I have to get that photo back
before anyone else sees it.

132
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,958
That's the reason?

133
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,541
Yes, Fukuyama's
blackmailing Kirie

134
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,708
with some horrible photograph.

135
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,208
No, I mean, well... maybe.

136
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,875
But... it's just a photo,
how bad can it be?

137
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,791
I don't wanna talk about it!

138
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,666
Damn that Fukuyama!

139
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,666
When he hands me
that first place trophy,

140
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,958
I'm gonna cram
it right up his...

141
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,833
Yeah! You said it!
Cram it right up his nose!

142
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,291
Huh?

143
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,458
I bet you can win
for sure, Kirie.

144
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,750
I'll cheer really loud,

145
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,041
so go out there
and do your best.

146
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:58,208
Right on! Kirie's gonna be
the new Girls Fight champion!

147
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,166
Don't let Fukuyama get to you.

148
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,708
I know you can do it!

149
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,916
Why not?

150
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,416
Hey, at this point,
I've got nothing to lose.

151
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,208
I might as well kick some ass
as long as I'm here, right?

152
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,958
How very confident,
but this is Girls Fight,

153
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:21,916
and none of your opponents
will hesitate to kick back.

154
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,416
Honestly, Big Brother,
I don't know why

155
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,416
you get so excited about
this tournament of yours.

156
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,291
It's kind of stupid.

157
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,541
[HAYATE] It's rather low-brow,
if I may be so bold.

158
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:43,083
[KOSAME] Miss Kirie, you'll
be mine so very soon now.

159
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,166
Geez! Why the hell
do I have to fight

160
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,916
dressed up in
this stupid costume?!

161
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:57,333
It's all part
of the fun, Kirie!

162
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,791
Here at Girls Fight,
we judge the contestants

163
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,791
on both their physical
prowess and their beauty.

164
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,041
If you're fortunate
enough to advance,

165
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,041
you'll get a
fabulous new costume

166
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,708
for each successive round.

167
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,708
Let's get this match started.

168
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,666
Don't forget to keep it sexy!

169
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,166
She's a natural.

170
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:43,333
I haven't broken a sweat!

171
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,041
That's amazing, Kirie.

172
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,250
If you win two more times,
you're the champ!

173
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,916
Don't worry, Kirie.

174
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,333
It'll be a piece of cake!

175
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,333
Good idea! If Kirie wins,
lets buy a cake!

176
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,666
Thanks you guys.

177
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,083
When I get that photo back,

178
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,416
Fukuyama and I are
gonna have a little chat.

179
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,250
You seem very confident of
your abilities Miss Kirie.

180
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,750
It's Hayate and Kosame.

181
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,541
What are you doing here?

182
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,291
We thought it would
be polite to stop by

183
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:13,541
and wish you the best of luck
before the next match begins.

184
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,125
Are you saying that
Kirie's next opponent is...

185
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:19,500
Yes.

186
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,708
Can you hear me?
Just hang in there!

187
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,708
Damn it!
She's lost consciousness.

188
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,333
Give her oxygen, stat!

189
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,166
She told me that she was
a pro wrestling champion.

190
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,333
I wanted to see
how strong she was.

191
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,625
If I had known
she was that weak,

192
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,791
I would've
given her a handicap.

193
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,958
Then that woman just now...
you did that?

194
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:42,208
Miss Kirie, I do hope
that you can satisfy me.

195
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Remember, Kirie,
don't let her corner you!

196
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,833
Keep moving no matter what!

197
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:02,500
Yeah, but... Yukinari...

198
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,458
The ring's full of mud!

199
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,041
How the hell am I
supposed to keep moving?

200
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,416
Come on, Fukuyama!

201
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,125
Why do I have to mud
wrestle against Kosame?

202
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,250
How's this for a reason?

203
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,666
I'm making you mud wrestle
because it's totally kinky!

204
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:28,791
So if there are no more
glaringly naïve questions,

205
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,666
let's get this match underway.

206
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,125
One more thing.

207
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,375
Oh, Miharu!

208
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,750
Yes? I'm down here, Fukuyama!

209
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,791
Isn't it about time for a snack?

210
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,125
Wow!

211
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,208
I had the vendors
send down a few things.

212
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,458
Please, eat as much
as you want.

213
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,125
As much as I want?

214
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:54,125
But of course. Koyomi,
Tomoka, help yourselves.

215
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,375
Uh, thank you.

216
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,000
Yeah! Tomo

217
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,291
Hey! They get lunch
and I get a thong?!

218
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,125
You should save it
for the fight, Kirie.

219
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:05,916
Ah, the semi-finals.
Ready? Begin!

220
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:14,291
Go mud wrestle in Hell!

221
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,791
Just give up before
you get hurt. Come on.

222
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,833
I knew you'd satisfy me.

223
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,916
Oh yeah?

224
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:46,083
Quit it!

225
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,583
Ever since the
first time we fought,

226
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,875
I wanted to do this.

227
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,625
Your breasts are
sublime Miss Kirie.

228
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,250
I can die happy now.

229
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,708
No!

230
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,833
I'm not finished!

231
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,000
Your skin is soft and lovely.

232
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,583
And you have such
great muscle tone.

233
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,875
No!

234
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,208
Make it stop!

235
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,750
Get off of me! Get off of me!
I said "Get off!"

236
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,291
Un-unh.

237
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,041
Let go of my boobs!

238
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,333
They're mine now.

239
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,791
Stop molesting me this instant!

240
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,041
Hey, I could really use
some advice right about now.

241
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,916
Yukinari!

242
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,625
This is so yummy.
Here, open up.

243
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,541
Put this pepper stuff
on the yakisoba, Koyo.

244
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,375
It makes it even better.

245
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,958
Oh, you're right.

246
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,625
I don't mean to ruin your meal,

247
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,583
but could you guys stop
stuffing your faces long enough

248
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,291
to help me get
the hell outta here?

249
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:48,333
Miss Kirie, let's get dirty.

250
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,666
You're gonna love
this stuff, Miharu.

251
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,250
It makes it tastier!

252
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,291
Miss Kirie, I love you!

253
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,291
Huh?

254
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,791
Kosame!

255
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,000
Huh. I really didn't think
Kirie could pull it off.

256
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,166
[LILICA] Yes,
I had acknowledged

257
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,166
the possibility
that Kirie might win,

258
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,291
but I'm surprised nonetheless.

259
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,333
Well, I assume
that you're ready

260
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,208
to defend your
place in the rankings?

261
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,875
Death before dishonor.

262
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,583
Just one question!

263
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:36,333
Who here's ready
for the final battle?

264
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,333
All right, then.
We're only moments away

265
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,958
from this year's Girls
Fight championship match.

266
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,500
Newcomer Kirie Kojima
may have bested

267
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:48,166
the number 2 ranked Kosame
with some peppery assistance,

268
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,666
but believe you me,

269
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,208
her final opponent is
no one to sneeze at!

270
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,791
Now approaching the ring

271
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:59,250
is the undefeated Girls Fight
champion, Lilica Stacy!

272
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,541
Isn't she...

273
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,666
That's the lady who cleans up
the dumb pervert's house.

274
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,041
My...

275
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,333
You're amazing Lilica!

276
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,666
Hold on a sec,
you're my final opponent?

277
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,916
Yes.

278
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,333
I expected some monster
to come lurching out.

279
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,541
I'm glad it's just you.

280
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,708
Is that so?

281
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,333
I do hope I give
you enough of a fight.

282
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,458
Per Girls Fight's tradition,

283
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,625
the final round
wire cage death match!

284
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,500
What the hell?

285
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:33,458
Ready? Begin!

286
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,500
Fukuyama's the one I wanna
beat up, not his maid.

287
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,791
Kirie, look out!

288
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,916
Huh?

289
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,541
Rule number 1,

290
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,375
never take your eyes off
your opponent during a fight.

291
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,083
Rule number 2,
always fight as though

292
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,583
your life depends on it,
because it does.

293
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,708
Kosame! Wake up!

294
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,583
Kosame! Thank Mabanya!

295
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,958
Miss Lisa?
I'm sorry. I lost.

296
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,208
[HAYATE]
Just save your strength.

297
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,708
You fought her very well.

298
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:18,500
Miss Kirie... did she win?

299
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,250
Kosame, wait!

300
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,166
[HAYATE] Kosame...

301
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,208
Miss Kirie...

302
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,500
Rule number 3...

303
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,666
Kirie!

304
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,958
Kirie!

305
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,250
I can't believe she
finally met her match.

306
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,791
That maid lady is
totally overpowering her.

307
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,458
Kirie, please, just give up.

308
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:01,000
She's not even trying, Yukinari.

309
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,750
If she thinks
I'm throwing in the towel,

310
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,916
she's in for a surprise.

311
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,083
No!

312
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,416
Kirie!

313
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,083
Kirie!

314
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,000
Kosame... but...

315
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,833
Kirie, wake up!

316
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:10,666
Is she okay?

317
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,041
Kirie!

318
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:12,958
Kirie!

319
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,791
Kirie, can you hear me?

320
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,500
Kirie, please get up.

321
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,583
Ah! Kirie!

322
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,375
Hey, guys.

323
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,750
Guess I lost.

324
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,500
Um, Kirie?

325
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,166
Kosame!

326
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:48,916
Are you okay?
Please, Kosame wake up.

327
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,000
Miss Kirie?

328
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,416
Oh Kosame,
I'm so glad you're all right.

329
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,333
I'm so glad.

330
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,708
Miss Kirie.

331
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:08,250
Huh? What's up?

332
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,250
My lips are sealed, Kirie.

333
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,416
This year's Girls Fight
was the best one ever!

334
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,208
Let's have a big old
round of applause, folks,

335
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,833
for all our beautiful ladies!

336
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,666
Oh, Kirie! Kosame!
That was so touching!

337
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,458
[HAYATE] Touching. Quite.

338
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,458
Aww, I'm crying
just like a little kid.

339
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,750
Yes, they're both wonderful.

340
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,958
But is it really that touching?

341
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,458
Or is everyone clapping for T&amp;A?

342
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,041
Um, yeah.

343
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:49,166
That was...
my very first kiss.

344
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,083
Lovely.

345
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:26,083
Yukinari! Yukinari!

346
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:28,250
Have you ever
seen so many fish?

347
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,583
Which one should we eat first?

348
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,958
This is an aquarium,
not a restaurant, Miharu.

349
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:33,833
Ikebukuro is a
really neat place.

350
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:36,000
I never knew there were
restaurants where you could

351
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,625
look at this many fish
before you eat them.

352
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,958
I'm so happy.

353
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,166
Miharu, you're not
allowed to eat the fish there.

354
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,583
