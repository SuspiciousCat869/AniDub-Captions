This is so boring!

00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:34,375
What's boring?
You didn't like the movie?

7
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,541
Uh, yeah, Tomoka's right.

8
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,750
The movie is
pretty stupid, huh?

9
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,708
We should take it back.

10
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,041
That's not what I mean!

11
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,500
Sitting around the house
watching movies is boring.

12

Tomo wants to
do something fun!

00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,041
Come on Short Stuff.

14
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:51,333
Why don't you take us
someplace fun for once.

15
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,083
I'd like to, but...

16
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,250
...we're a little
short on money.

17
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,416
Yes, it's because he's been

18
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,750
letting us live here
for free all this time.

19
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,208
Yes, that's right.

20
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,541
Yukinari is
poor because of us.

00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:09,083
No! I don't wanna hear excuses!
I just wanna go out!

22
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:13,125
Hey, Tomoka, do you feel like
playing an Earthling game?

23
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:16,333
Huh? An Earthling game?
Do you really mean it?

24
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,875
Nya...

25
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,916
It's still your turn Tomoka.

26
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,416
Maybe you can't play
any more of your cards.

27
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,208
Tomoka, if you
have to skip your turn

28
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,291
3 times in a row, then...

29
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,833
You're out.
I'm sorry, Tomoka.

30
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,916
All right. Which one?

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,791
Huh?

00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:42,750
Which one of you is it?

Locking the 8 of hearts!

Trying to force me out, huh?

35
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,958
I'm not having fun!

00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:53,125
No fair! No fair!
Tomo wanted to win!

37
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,125
Um, maybe...
you'll win next time.

38
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,750
I didn't wanna play this
stupid game in the first place.

39
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,416
How am I supposed to
show you how clever I am

40
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,625
if I'm stuck playing a game
meant for little kids, huh?

41
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,041
Who's there?

42
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,958
Care to try your luck
at something more adult then?

[EVERYONE] Fu-Fukuyama!

I overheard the conversation
as I was sneaking in.

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,375
It sounds like Tomoka

46
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,041
wants to play something
a little more exciting, right?

47
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:24,708
Exactly! Yeah! I wanna
play a game that's super fun!

48

You're very lucky
I stopped by, Tomoka!

If there's one thing
I've got, it's game!

No, Lilica, that will do.

will be a lot more fun!

Hey, wait, those are tiles
for Mah-Jong, aren't they?

64
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:10,041
Ma-Mah-Jong? What's that?

65
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,375
Mah-Jong sounds like
a really tasty game.

66
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,583
Get real!

67
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,375
You know Mah-Jong's
gonna bore Tomoka

right out of her
blonde little head.

69
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,708
If this were ordinary
Mah-Jong, yes, but it's not.

70
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,375
It's a very, very
special version.

71
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,666
A Fukuyama family favorite.

72
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,000
He's right.
The tiles are... different.

73
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:35,250
Huh? Different?
Different how?

74
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,500
Um, this one says "undress."

75
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:42,625
Hey, look at this tile.
What are you supposed to rub?

76
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:46,958
What the hell are those?!

77
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:50,083
I told you it was
Fukuyama-style Mah-Jong.

78
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,708
The rules are the same:

79
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,583
Collect 4 three-tile sets
and you win.

And what happens
when the game's over?

Keep talking, perv.

83
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,750
Based on their tiles,

84
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,041
the winner can make
the loser undress,

85

rub them for a while,

86

or make them wear one
of our delightful costumes.

over the Mah-Jong outfits.

I don't want to get rubbed
any more than I already have.

Wah!

Dammit. Just tie me into
a knot already, why don't you?

98
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,583
You really should be
more careful, Kirie.

99
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,625
What would the
world do without me?

100

Don't bring over
sleazy games,

and I won't hurt you, okay?

102

It's not a sleazy game! This
game looks really interesting!

103

Yeah, it sounds
like a lot of fun.

104
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,458
And these costumes
are adorable.

Seashells!

106

Oh look, there's
even rabbit ears.

Miharu says the cutest things,

108
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,625
but sometimes
I think she's sort of...

109
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah, a little slow. Ditto.

110
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,500
Well, at least these two
are willing to take a chance.

111
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,291
Yeah!

112
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,833
Bring on the Mah-Jong!

Nya nya!

114

Okay, it's your call, Kirie.

115
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,791
Of course, if you're
really that afraid of losing,

116
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,708
I'll stop
pestering you about it.

117
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,375
Getting you naked would be
like shooting fish in a barrel,

118
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,625
only a whole lot less sporting.

119
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,875
No wonder you're
too afraid to play.

[FUKUYAMA laughing]

Don't do it!
Can't you see he's trying to--

123
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:50,000
Bring it on!
I'll show you who's scared.

124
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,375
First, I'm gonna beat
your ass at Mah-Jong,

125
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,875
and then we're
gonna play dress up!

126
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:59,416
Hmm. That's the spirit.
I'm glad you changed your mind.

127
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,875
As for you, I'd usually
say no, but I'm feeling

128
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,541
uncharacteristically
generous today.

129
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:09,541
You can play also.
Just try to stay clothed.

130
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,291
What?!

131
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:17,000
Your generosity is legendary.
Thank you for this privilege.

132
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:25,375
All right then. Here we go!

133
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,541
The first game will
be between the four of us.

134
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,750
I'm gonna win!

135
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,750
I'll try my best
not to beat you, sir.

136
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:35,750
Nobody made me play games
like this on Seiren.

137
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,750
Enough talking!
Let's get started!

138
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,541
Nya! Nya! Nya! Nya!

139

Huh? Do you wanna
play too, Ebi?

140
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,708
Okay! You can
be on Tomo's team!

141

Nya. Nya nya-nya-nya!

142
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,291
[EBI] So, here's what
we're gonna do.

143
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,875
I wanna finish the game
with an easy hand at first.

144
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,125
You know, get a
"feel" for the table.

145
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,625
If we get some rubs, we
should throw away rabbit ears.

146
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,583
Then we play the waiting game

147
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:04,083
and grab good tiles
from Fukuyama and Hayate.

148
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,375
Damn I'm good.

149
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,125
So which tile
should Tomo choose?

150
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,916
Mmm. This one!

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,625
Nya! Nya!

152
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,958
That's a stupid tile!

Nyo nyo nyo nyo!

154
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,291
What's gotten into you, Ebi?

155
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,750
Nyo nyo nyo nyo!

156

Stop freaking out!

00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:27,666
I don't want that, either!

162
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,416
No no!

163
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,625
And I definitely
don't want that.

164
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:34,583
Nyo nyo nyo nyo!

165
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:39,291
Why is it...
that I'm sitting here

166
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,666
wearing nothing but a snake?

167
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,666
Hey! I can hardly
move in this thing!

168
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,666
Neither can I.
This is a problem.

169
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:54,291
Fukuyama! How come you're
not wearing something dumb?

170
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,625
I guess I'm just that good.

171
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,166
If you don't feel
like getting naked,

172
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,833
you should just quit
while you're ahead, Kirie.

173
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,333
I'm not quitting!

174
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:07,291
There's no way you're
getting off that easy!

175
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,708
Then let's begin
the second game.

176
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,666
I'll do my best! Yay!

177
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,875
Is it too late to
watch that horror movie?

178
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:27,000
And so it begins!

179
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,833
Nyo nyo nyo!

180
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,000
I see. Someone has trained you.

181
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,708
But not well enough!

182
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,000
"Dear Mother, How are you?

183
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,916
I'm sitting in a
backyard on Earth,

184
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,541
naked except for the huge
snake wrapped around my body.

185
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:49,875
I've never been so
humiliated in my entire life.

186
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,041
I wish the snake would
just swallow me whole,

187
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,041
so I wouldn't have to
deal with this horrible,

188
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,916
horrible planet any longer.
Love, Koyomi"

189
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:04,458
Now what? Oh it's you.

190
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,583
Ha! Read 'em and weep!

191
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,916
So, Kirie, how 'bout you slip
into a gym class outfit for me?

192
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,083
And let me have it...
when you're done.

193
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:21,958
Fukuyama! How come
you're only targeting me?!

194
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,291
I'm not exactly fully
clothed over here, you know.

195
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,583
There's plenty of humiliation
to go around, okay?

196
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,041
What did you say?

197
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,416
I'm gonna wedge those tights
where the sun don't shine!

198
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,458
They're already there,
but I appreciate the offer.

199
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,583
Now lose the top!

200
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,250
Don't get so riled up, you two.

201
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,125
It's only a game of Mah-Jong.

202
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,750
Just look on the bright side.

203
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,541
Now you have a brand
new gym uniform,

204
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,083
and it didn't
cost you a thing.

205
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,583
Isn't that lucky?

206
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,791
Yeah, that's
gonna calm her down.

207
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,375
Hmph. You can
drop out if you want to,

208
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:54,083
but you'll have to pay
the balance, either way.

209
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,333
For the last time,
I'm not quitting!

210
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,416
Hmm. Good to know.

211
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,166
Fine. Now come on,
let's hurry up

212
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,083
and start
the next game already.

213
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:06,125
Kirie's competitive nature
clouds her judgment.

214
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,958
She can't beat me.

215
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,791
The real threat is... Miharu.

216
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:15,125
Oh! That one!

217
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,583
Huh? Already?

218
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,000
Done!

219
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:24,958
All right, I get to rub
Yukinari 3 times, right?

220
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:28,458
Uh, Miharu?

221
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,916
Wah! Hold on Miharu! No, wait!

222
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,083
This is fun!
Rub rub rub rub rub!

223
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,500
Who would have guessed
Miharu has such good luck?

224
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,791
So much for my naughty
fun. Pity that.

225
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:41,708
Hey, why don't
you take a break?

226
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,958
You can re-think
your strategery.

227
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,541
Huh?

228
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,333
Splendid idea.

229
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,541
All right, let's take
a break. How's that sound?

230
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,791
Oh! Okay!

231
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,333
I'll go make
some tea for everyone.

232
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,500
Damn it all, I was so
close to finishing, too.

233
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:04,166
One of these,
and one more rub tile,

234
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,125
and I'd have
the perfect hand.

235
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,833
Well, I need to go
take care of something.

236
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,208
Quiet, cat boy.

237
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,375
Looking good, Puny-nari.

238
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,000
Fukuyama...

239
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:23,375
what are you doing
in here... with Kosame?

240
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,750
Oh, nothing.

241
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,000
I just thought maybe
you'd like to team up with me.

242
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,708
Team up? With you?

243
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,708
That's right. I think we
should try working together.

244
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:36,666
It's the only
way to beat Miharu.

245
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,875
Wait, you wanna cheat?!

246
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,166
Do you really wanna
die looking like that?

247
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,041
Come, Puny-nari, you
know you're dying to see

248
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,875
Miharu wear all
sorts of sexy costumes!

249
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,541
You know you want to.

250
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:52,541
Well...
I mean I...

251
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,875
... a little bit.

252
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,500
So you shall.

253
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,291
Don't bungle
this up, Puny-nari.

254

Hey, Big Brother,
how did it go?

in there somewhere!

Bravo!

Wait 'til I tell
Miharu how Yukinari

259
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:16,458
teamed up with Big Brother
to cheat her out of her clothes.

260
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,375
You cheated and made me
wear skimpy outfits.

261
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,291
Yukinari, how could you?

262
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,708
Miharu, wait!

263
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,375
Don't worry, Yukinari.

264
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,958
I'll never abandon
you like Miharu did.

265
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,250

say this one time.

get into the house?

320
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,791
Quick hide all the goats!

321
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:17,291
My mistake!
It was really just a coat rack.

322
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,083
You're an odd little girl.

323
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,791
Done.

324
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:33,500
Well, I'm gonna finish
my set now, too. Here we go.

325
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,208
Perfect.

326
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,708
There's no damn way
I'm gonna lose this time.

327
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,083
Done!

328
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,833
You've gotta be kidding me!

329
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,791
This is degrading.

330
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,458
Why do I have to
wear this thing.

331
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,166
Cheer up, Kirie.

332
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,250
I think that costume
looks really cute on you.

333
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,583
It could be worse.

334
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,458
You could look like
that guy at the convention.

335
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,916
Fukuyama! It's time
we upped the ante.

336
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,625
I think the loser
of the final game

337
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,333
should walk around
the neighborhood.

338
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,250
I'm having plenty of fun
just the way things are.

339
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,333
Why the hell would I want--

340
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,208
If I lose the last game,

341
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,500
I'll go around in a loin cloth

342
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,458
or anything else you
can possibly think of.

343
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,166
Do you want to do it or not?

344
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,208
What are you saying, Kirie?
Are you crazy?

345
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,750
Huh. A loin cloth, eh?

346
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,500
Fantastic!
Then I accept your offer.

347
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,916
And if I win the last game,

348
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,166
then I wanna give Yukinari
a super extra special rub.

349
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,500
Knock yourself out.
You can rub him all you want.

350
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:41,291
Great! Hold on to
your ears, Yukinari.

351
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,208
But I don't want a rub!

352
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,125
Do or die time, Puny-nari.

353
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,333
We'll play it safe
and knock Kirie out

354
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,666
right away with a Tenho.

355
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,000
What's a Tenho?

356
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,166
Wait, don't tell me.

357
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,291
I've had enough.
I'm done playing.

358
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,875
You sure about that?

359
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,083
The idea behind
Tenho is simple.

360
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:06,041
You give me enough good
tiles to win right away.

361
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,916
Don't fail me, Puny-nari.

362
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,166
I can't betray Kirie.

363
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,208
Don't try anything funny.

364
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:17,708
Huh? Yukinari dear,
are you all right?

365
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,583
You look sick.

366
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,833
I'm sure they're just
"last game jitters."

367
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,416
Am I right?

368
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,708
Uh, yeah.

369
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,416
Okay, let's finish this!

370
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,083
Yeah! I'll play my very best,

371
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,375
so I can give Yukinari
my super special rub!

372
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,375
Good luck, Yukinari.

373
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:38,750
And so begins...
our final game!

374
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:49,916
This is perfect.

375
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,541
Once I roll two on the dice,
everything will be set.

376
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,458
Prepare yourself, Kirie.

377
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,416
Here goes!

378
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,750
Nya nya nya nya!

379
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,583
Wha? What the hell
just happened?

380
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,625
I got a little
wild with my swing.

381
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,291
A thousand pardons.

382
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,125
You're not injured,
are you, Master?

383
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,875
Um, I'm guessing that we did
something we shouldn't have.

384
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:31,000
Dammit. You know I thought
something seemed fishy.

385
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,291
You were cheating
the whole damn time, huh?

386
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,000
Even you, Yukinari!

387
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,000
Yukinari, how could you?

388
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,125
I thought you were different,

389
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,583
but you're just
like all the others.

390
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:44,958
But... I didn't... I mean...
Kosame was gonna shoot me!

391
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,791
Save your lame excuses.

392
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:51,000
Enjoy your little
field trip you cheaters.

393
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,500
You ready?

394
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,500
Hmm. A promise is a promise.

395
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,375
How come I have to do this?
I wasn't even playing.

396
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:04,875
I'm sorry, Miss Lisa.

397
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,166
I'll explain guilt
by association later.

398
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,833
For now though,
we should get walking.

399
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:14,458
Hey Fukuyama, cheaters
never do prosper, do they?

400
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,666
Well, not this time.

401
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,375
My strategy was perfect.

402
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,583
If she'd kept that rub
and thrown away rabbit ears,

403
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,375
she could have finished a set.

404
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:03,250
I can't figure out why
she didn't hang on to that rub.

405
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,916
You gotta form sets
fast in that first game.

406
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,958
Why doesn't she get
something so simple?

407
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:12,083
We're together every day,
but she doesn't understand me.

408
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,666
Huh, that's women for ya.

409
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:21,000
How come the others never
seem to understand me...

410
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:29,041
The sound of
a siren at midnight...

411
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:33,291
People scream and it cuts
through the peaceful night.

412
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:36,833
Observe the fatal battle
between 3 rabbits

413
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,458
who steal everything
in the darkness of night,

414
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:43,333
and the detective intent
on tracking them down.

415
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:46,333
Girls Bravo
Season Two, next episode,

416
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:47,958
"Rabbit Ears Bravo!"

417
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:49,541
Don't miss it.

418
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,041
Am I just a sound effect?
