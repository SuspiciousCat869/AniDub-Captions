1
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,666
[MAHARU laughs]

2
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:25,666
I'll have an Earth man
of my very own in no time!

3
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,458
With a body as hot as mine,

4
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,958
there's no way he'll
be able to resist me.

5
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,666
I'm counting on you two,
happy hunting!

6
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,125
[POYON] Magical Girl
Papipupe-poyon!

7
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,416
Give transcendence advent
in this world of anxiety!

8
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,958
What?

9
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:56,250
Maharu wants you to track down
a husband for her on Earth?

10
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,166
Uh-huh.

11
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,958
Wait... Maharu?

12
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,666
Yeah, she's my big sister.

13
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,583
She's having a bit of trouble
in the romance department.

14
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,416
It's because men are pretty
rare back home on Seiren.

15
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,708
Oh, I see.

16
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,291
Maharu asked me if
I'd look as a favor.

17
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,333
She told me to take
as long as I need,

18
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,791
but I just don't
know if I can do it.

19
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,666
You get kind of... anxious

20
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,583
when there're
guys around, huh?

21
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah.

22
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,500
That mission is child's play.
Just leave it to Tomo!

23
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,458
I'll get the job done.

24
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,583
Uh...

25
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,458
Okay.

26
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,500
Who's she?

27
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,208
Right. I didn't
introduce her yet.

28
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,250
I'd like you all to meet
Tomoka Lana Jude.

29
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,625
She came along to assist me.

30
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:41,625
I'm a special agent with the
Seiren Space Management Bureau.

31
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,958
You're a special agent?

32
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,000
But aren't you just a kid?

33
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,125
Tomo's not just a kid!

34
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,375
Tomo is a very important
person back on Seiren,

35
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,166
and I brought
a bunch of stuff

36
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,833
that'll make this
assignment a piece of cake.

37
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,416
Observe.

38
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,375
[EBI] Nya?

39
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,250
Get out of there!

40
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,875
What the hell is that?

41
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,000
Is that gonna
help us find a man?

42
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,750
I don't know.
What does it do, Tomoka?

43
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,000
I've never seen
that thing before.

44
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:24,416
What was it doing in my bag?

45
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,375
Let's eat it.

46
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,958
Nyo!

47
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:27,833
Nya nya!

48
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,916
Don't look at me, freeloader.

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,833
Nya!

50
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,125
Hey, quit it, come on.

51
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,041
You can't just go
sticking your nose wherev--

52
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,125
You damn kinky seal!
Stop it already!

53
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,000
Nya!

54
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,416
Nya nyo.

55
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,458
It's okay, little guy.
I'm not gonna eat you... yet.

56
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,250
Nya nya!

57
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,666
Wait! Stop bouncing away!

58
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,833
I gotta ask,
do you really think

59
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,666
Miharu's gonna
eat that thing?

60
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,375
Pretty much
looks that way.

61
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,000
That's just gross.

62
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,208
At this rate,
how will I ever be able

63
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,083
to carry out
my promise to Maharu?

64
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,916
Whoa! What is that?

65
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,041
That's totally cool!

66
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,791
Wow! That's amazing!
What's that one? Neat!

67
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,083
Ahh. Special agent or not,
she's still just a little kid.

68
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,250
So anyway, Miharu,
when did the two of you

69
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,166
start getting along so well?

70
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,500
Little Ebi and I have
gotten along from the beginning.

71
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,833
Ebi?

72
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,291
Right, huh, Ebi?

73
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,833
Nya nya nya.

74
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,916
Is that really what
you've decided to call it?

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,916
Uh-huh!
Doesn't it sound tasty?

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,375
Nya nya nya nya-nya!

77
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm ashamed
to admit it, Mother,

78
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,125
but I'm beginning
to lose heart.

79
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,583
I took this job,

80
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,916
because I wanted to be able
to bring people together.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,333
And I really wanted
to do right by Maharu

82
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,625
and honor her request
for a husband,

83
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,666
because I felt bad
about how she hasn't

84
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,250
been able to get married,

85
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,666
but there are
so many men on Earth.

86
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,333
More than I ever
could have imagined.

87
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,333
I can't even walk down
the street out of fear of them.

88
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,583
I have to hide in
the shadows and in the alleys,

89
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,666
and even there
I don't feel safe.

90
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,791
I always expect the worst.

91
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,750
What if I can't
fulfill Maharu's request?

92
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,916
And what do
I do if I run into

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,750
that monstrous man
from before...

94
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,416
the one with the demented
laugh and the white gloves.

95
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,416
If he should
ever catch me...

96
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,208
I can't even imagine
the horrors that await me!

97
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:41,333
The things he'll do!
Oh no no! No no no no! Wah!

98
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,416
Hey, uh, Koyomi?

99
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,958
Now what?!

100
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,708
Oh man. I could be wrong,

101
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,375
but I don't think
you're up for this.

102
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,541
Hey Koyo,
stop hiding in there.

103
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,500
You're never gonna
complete Maharu's request

104
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,750
if you're always acting
like such a 'fraidy cat!

105
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,541
Well it's the truth, right?

106
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,458
Aw, come on now, Tomoka.

107
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,541
There's no reason
to get so upset.

108
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,958
Tomo is not upset!

109
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,666
I'm only saying
all this stuff

110
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,291
'cause Koyo needed some
positive reinforcement.

111
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,583
Well, that's
just how kids are.

112
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,458
They think that yelling
fixes every problem.

113
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:24,208
Koyomi, there's no deadline,
so just take your time.

114
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,166
I agree.
Just do your best,

115
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,083
and you'll be
sure to find a man.

116
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,458
Yeah, totally.

117
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't worry about what
some little kid has to say.

118
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,208
Tomo is not a little kid!

119
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,291
And to prove
that Tomo's no kid,

120
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,208
I'm gonna go out there
and find a husband

121
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,000
for Maharu
before Koyo can!

122
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,125
But... what about Koyomi?

123
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,166
Well I can't
possibly take care

124
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,750
of shy little
Koyo all the time.

125
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,458
If you wanna make it fair,

126
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,166
I guess you guys
could team up with her.

127
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,916
You want us to
help out Koyomi, then?

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,291
Sure I do.

129
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,791
Somebody as important,

130
00:07:56,875 --> 00:08:01,833
and mature, and beautiful
as Tomo doesn't mind a handicap.

131
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,500
Well then, Koyo.
No time to waste.

132
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,208
Hey, cheer up.

133
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,166
The three of us are
gonna help you find a guy.

134
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,791
It'll be easy, okay?

135
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,666
Okay.

136
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,291
So then, what do we do?

137
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,541
Just relax.

138
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,333
There's always more than
one way to skin a cat.

139
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,375
Will we have to...
skin a cat?

140
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,000
Careless. Very careless.

141
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,458
I let Yukinari out of my
sight for just a little while,

142
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,708
and now some other girl's
in love with my soul mate again.

143
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,875
Look at her, throwing
herself at my dear Yukinari.

144
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,333
[muffled scream]

145
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,041
Hayate! Kosame!

146
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,333
You summoned us?

147
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,458
Mistress Lisa?

148
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,625
You will investigate
that girl for me.

149
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,083
Know thy enemy.

150
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,125
Right.

151
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,958
Is this... one of the ways
that you skin a cat?

152
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,666
Stop freaking out!

153
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,750
This way you'll be able
to find a man in no time flat.

154
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:01,666
Even so, I think
this is... a bit much.

155
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,333
Hey, cutie!
Gimme some love!

156
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,666
Okay!

157
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,625
Yeah! Over here, too! Bend
forward a little, yeah!

158
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,291
Do you mean like this?

159
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,541
Woah! Cleavage-a-rama!

160
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,375
Whoa! Booty-licious!

161
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,666
Shoot men!
Just keep shooting!

162

What is that girl who's after
my soul mate doing over there?

I have discovered
her weakness.

181
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,333
It would seem that
she's quite terrified of men.

00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,375
She's terrified
of men?

Then how exactly do
you explain all that.

Well, the details are unclear,

just say husband?!

to bury my face in those.

She's wearing that
trampy little outfit

Miss, do you have a plan?

194
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,583
That girl...

195
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,208
You said she's terrified
of men, did you not?

one thing to do.

you so bad.

Where could she have gone?

324
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,750
I think we've
lost them for now.

325
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,041
[KOYOMI crying]

326
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,041
Hey, I'm sorry.

327
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,458
I didn't know it
was gonna get that bad.

328
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:58,541
Just leave me alone already!

329
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,166
I've got it!

330
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,833
This is a great
time for a bath!

331
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:02,750
What?

332
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:03,416
What?

333
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,750
Whenever you're sad,

334
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,083
a good bath makes you feel
like a whole new person!

335
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,416
Come on, Koyomi.

336
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,000
But I... I don't want to!

337
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,583
Hey Mister, do you wanna
go somewhere with Tomo?

338
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,833
Sure, we can go
anywhere you want.

339
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,291
Tomo is so happy!

340
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,666
I'm super glad
that I met you.

341
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,291
Hey now,
don't get carried away.

342
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,333
[TOMO giggles]

343
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,416
Okay! Here we are.

344
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,833
Huh? But this is...

345
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,625
I'm terrible...
taking it out on them

346
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,375
after all
they've done to help me.

347
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,500
I need to apologize.

348
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,958
And I have to tell
Maharu the truth, too.

349
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:53,625
I'm not going to be able
to honor her request.

350
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,875
Well this is it!

351
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:01,250
Hmm? Koyomi?

352
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,833
All right!

353
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,666
Nooo!

354
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,625
[KIRIE] What?
[MIHARU] Huh?

355
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,500
[YUKINARI] Koyomi!

356
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:11,583
Fukuyama?

357
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,208
Oh, Miharu too.

358
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,750
You both found it impossible
to forget about me,

359
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,958
and so you came
back to Earth, right?

360
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,250
That's so sweet.

361
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,916
Wrong wrong wrong!
I didn't come back for you!

362
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,125
Let go, you!

363
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:25,500
Tomo found this
man fair and square!

364
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:28,666
I hope the irony of this
isn't lost on the two of you.

365
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,666
Please just let go of me.

366
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,458
Wait, Koyomi, don't
wriggle around so much!

367
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,625
It's that light again!

368
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,125
They... they all vanished.

369
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,166
Hey Maharu.

370
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,833
So I guess Miharu
used to live here too, huh?

371
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,208
What is it with you?

372
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,208
I'm in the middle
of taking a bath!

373
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,458
Now, now. You'll be
very glad Tomo stopped in.

374
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,625
Yeah! I brought you
a husband from Earth,

375
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,625
just like you
asked us to do.

376
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,000
Let's see...

377
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:14,083
Ah, a husband.
And that would be him?

378
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,125
That's right!

379
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,250
He seems kinda stupid,

380
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,375
but I think
he's pretty cute.

381
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,250
Please, I'm begging you!

382
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,250
You don't have to
play so hard to get.

383
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,208
I know that in your most
secret heart of hearts,

384
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,416
you think that
I'm number one.

385
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,625
If anything, I think that
you're public enemy number one!

386
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,500
He's good looking all right...

387
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,791
for a guy who acts like
he needs to be hosed down.

388
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,416
Yeah, I hadn't noticed.

389
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,833
Seriously, I had no idea

390
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,208
that guy was
such a pervert.

391
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,958
I guess that
was my fault.

392
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,208
Quiet!

393
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:52,833
Uh... Ma-Maharu.

394
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:57,458
Maharu! I've ended up
in some nudist paradise

395
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:02,125
where all the women
are as beautiful as Koyomi!

396
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,250
Did you seriously
think that I would

397
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,291
accept this sleazeball?

398
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,416
No! I had nothing to do
with it! He wouldn't let go!

399
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,708
A sleazeball?

400
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,125
No, you've got it all wrong.

401
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,916
And if loving beautiful
women like you is wrong,

402
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,708
I don't wanna be right.

403
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,166
Stop feeding me
lame excuses,

404
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,583
and go find me
a quality man!

405
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,916
I'm really sorry!

406
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,875
Koyomi and the others...
they haven't come back yet.

407
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,208
I wonder how
things turned out.

408
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,625
I mean look at
the guy they took.

409
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:42,125
Yeah. I'll bet Seiren
still doesn't know what hit it.

410
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:42,666
Huh?

411
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,166
I'm so sorry!

412
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,333
Koyomi!

413
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,625
Almost forgot
what it looked like...

414
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:58,166
Koyomi my darling.
Where did you go?

415
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,458
Koyomi?

416
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:05,000
Go look for her... in Hell!

417
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:13,291
Uh, what just happened?
Looks kinda iffy.

418
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,833
Tomoka's back also.

419
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,625
You weren't gone very long.
Did it not go too well.

420
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,666
Um, about that...

421
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,541
Maharu kinda
sorta chewed us out.

422
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:27,000
She told us not
to bring back perverts.

423
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,000
Well, at least
the girl's got good taste.

424
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,208
I'll have to start
looking all over again.

425
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:37,875
It's tough being the best.

426
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:42,250
I have to tell you, Mother,
Earth is a scary place.

427
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,541
Random men pick on me,

428
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,166
and there's this
one pervert

429
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,500
who won't stop
chasing me around.

430
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:53,291
I want... I want...

431
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,083
I just wanna go
home to Seiren!
