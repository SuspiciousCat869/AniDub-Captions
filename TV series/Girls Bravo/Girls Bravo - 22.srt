[school bell rings]

2
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,208
That's all we have for today.

3
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,916
She gave us so much homework.

4
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,750
There is no way I can
read six chapters tonight.

5
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:38,125
Well hey, you wanna go to
baseball tryouts this afternoon?

6
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,291
Miharu.

7
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:39,916
Huh?

8
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,916
Ready to go?

9
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,583
Um, actually,
there's something

10
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:43,833
I kinda have to take care of.

11
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:44,916
Yeah? Like what?

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,416
See ya later!

13
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,875
Well, if it
isn't my favorite

14
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:52,041
pink-haired
alien girl-- Huh?

15
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,875
What's the matter with her?

16
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,375
No idea.

17
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:01,583
You know she has been going
out by herself a lot lately.

18
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,416
I have to hurry.

19
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,625
You definitely earned this.

20
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,541
Wow!

21
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,791
You're one of the best
workers I've ever had.

22
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,125
Thank you, sir.

23
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,916
Working here
was a lot of fun.

24
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,083
You know, having you around's

25
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,458
given my banana
a whole new lease on life!

26
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,625
Huh?

27
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,458
By the way,
why did you take this job?

28
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,666
I mean, you don't seem

29
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,625
like you're hard up
for money or anything.

30
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,416
Huh? Well, ya see,
I wanted to buy some gifts

31
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,958
for the people who
are important to me.

32
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,250
Yeah?

33
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,916
The friends
I've made here

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,333
have all been
really good to me.

35
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,750
I can't help them out

36
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,291
the same way
they've helped me,

37
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,000
but I can buy
them something nice

38
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,583
to let them know
how much I care.

39
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,416
It's my way of
saying thank you.

40
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,666
That's very kind.

41
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,125
You're always welcome here.

42
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,375
'Kay. Well, thank you very much.

43
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,250
I hope she doesn't
notice I overpaid her,

44
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,500
or she'll probably
bring it back.

45
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:07,166
Okay then. Huh?

46
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,333
We're home.

47
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,000
We're home.

48
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:10,750
Hey you crazy kids.

49
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,583
Nya!

50
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,000
Hello you three.

51
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,916
Oh my, Miharu didn't walk
home from school with you?

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,458
No, not today.

53
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,333
Yeah, she said she had to
go take care of something.

54
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,458
Well, she hasn't
come home yet.

55
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,125
Tomo hasn't seen her either.

56
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:24,791
Nya. Nya!

57
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,041
Oh.

58
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,125
Man, I could eat a horse.

59
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,166
Whatcha got?

60
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,166
Well, I did buy
some mochi today.

61
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,958
Let's have teatime.

62
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,125
Yeah!

63
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,375
Mochi mochi gonna
be in my belly soon.

64
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,500
Nya nya nyaya
nya nya nya nya.

65
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,958
Mochi mochi gonna
be in my belly soon.

66
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,041
Welcome home, Yukinari.

67
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,291
They're eating our mochi.

68
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,125
How the hell'd
you two get in here?

69
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,000
Well, I'm happy
to see you too, Kirie.

70
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,500
Here we are, Yukinari.

71
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,000
Just the two of us,
well, and everyone else.

72
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,541
And no Miharu!

73
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,125
I'm always having to play

74
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:01,041
second fiddle to
that pink-haired ditz!

75
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:05,333
Lisa, stop throwing
yourself at Puny-nari!

76
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,583
You can be such a square.

77
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:12,875
We're soul mates, Yukinari.

78
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,333
Mabanya told me so.

79
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,041
Why else would
we both be here?

80
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,375
'Cause I live here,
and you're crazy?

81
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:25,500
Oh no! You're so
vigorous, Yukinari.

82
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,916
At least she's consistent.

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,541
Down Lisa!

84
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,333
[KOSAME] Miss Kirie,
let my mistress have her fun.

85
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:38,541
No!

86
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:47,000
Which of these would
Kirie like better?

87
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,916
I love it!

88
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,250
This cup is just
perfect for Koyomi.

89
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,750
Tomoka and Ebi
are gonna love this.

90
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,333
Oh Mabanya...

91
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,583
I hope Lisa doesn't have
a weird mushroom thingy.

92
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:15,958
Fukuyama's always
staring at my panties.

93
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,291
Maybe I should
buy him a pair.

94
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,250
Or maybe he'd like
a bra even better.

95
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,083
No!

96
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,916
Miss Kirie will you
be my big sister please!

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,083
Your big sister?

98
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,916
You're older than me,
you nutcase!

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,500
At last, it's finally time
for us to consummate our love.

100
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,916
So... consummate
me already, dammit.

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,375
No thanks!

102
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,416
Whoa, Lisa just touched him
in his bathing suit place.

103
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,791
What are we gonna do?

104
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,083
We have to save him,
and quick!

105
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:59,666
Koyomi, why don't we
follow their example?

106
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,166
[FUKUYAMA laughs]
[KOYOMI screams]

107
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,791
Once I buy Yukinari
something, I'm all done.

108
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:15,000
What could I get him that
would make him really happy?

109
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,000
Huh?

110
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,333
Wow!

111
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,000
Huh?

112
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:31,500
It's so pretty.

113
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,166
Koyomi!

114
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,333
The very sight of you warms
the cockles of my heart!

115
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't want anything
to do with your cockles!

116
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,500
Just leave me alone!

117
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:47,208
Oh, it's my first time,
and I'm on top.

118
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,875
Have your way with me,
you blue-haired Adonis.

119
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:53,541
You've been teasing me
all year, you naughty boy.

120
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,166
Come on, sexy.

121
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,583
Time to put your mouth
where my money is.

122
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,375
Huh?

123
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:04,041
That hurt.
You're so rough, Yukinari.

124
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,416
I never would have
guessed you liked it rough!

125
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,375
I don't mind, darling.

126
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:12,250
However you wanna
do it is fine with me!

127
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,416
Blond witchy girl just
doesn't know when to quit, huh?

128
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
[HAYATE] How right you are.

129
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,375
Whoa. How did you do that?

130
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,333
It's like you're
a ninja or something.

131
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,666
Well, our training
regimen was not dissimilar.

132
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,208
We follow
Mistress Lisa at all times,

133
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,875
undetectable until we
choose to reveal ourselves.

134
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,041
Or until we choose to strike.

135
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,916
Hmm. That's gotta be tough.

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,916
Tomo respects
your abilities.

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,875
You know, that means a lot
to me coming from you.

138
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,083
We never did finish our battle
in the backyard the other day...

139
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,875
You need only name
the time and the place.

140
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:52,708
Oh yeah, how 'bout now?
You're goin' down!

141
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,583
I think not!

142
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,291
I'm sure Yukinari will like
this present I got for him.

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,458
Yukinari...

144
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,250
I should hurry back home,

145
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,541
so I can give everybody
their presents. Yeah!

146
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,791
Nya.

147
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,458
How could you do
such a terrible thing?

148
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,625
Wait, I'm sorry!

149
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,791
What if Yukinari is
stupid or impotent now,

150
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,375
because you
clobbered him, huh?

151
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,833
The universe isn't going
to give me a new soul mate,

152
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,625
just because
you broke this one.

153
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,666
I am terribly sorry,
Mistress Lisa.

154
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,541
Tomo's sorry too. Our bad.

155
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,333
Why were you
roughhousing in here anyway?

156
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,500
Did you both grow up
on a farm or something?

157
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,166
I've never even seen a farm,

158
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,583
but I bet people
are hitting each other

159
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,583
with animals on
farms all the time.

160
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,166
Lisa, I'm okay.

161
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,541
I'll carry this
regret to my grave.

162
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,333
It's not like we
meant to clobber him.

163
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,708
It just kinda happened.

164
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:45,958
Haven't you guys

165
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,083
ever been obsessively
in love with someone?

166
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,458
Love is everything.

167
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,083
If more people felt
all-consuming love like I do,

168
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,500
there'd be no war.

169
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,833
Yes! And once I get
Yukinari to love me back,

170
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,333
we'll all get to
live in a perfect

171
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,000
candy-coated utopia
filled with awesome clothes

172
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,166
and the occasional human
sacrifice to Mabanya.

173
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,833
You are bat-shit crazy,
aren't you?

174
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,208
As always, I find your
theories most intriguing.

175
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,500
Yeah, whatever.

176
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,708
I didn't grow up on a farm,

177
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:16,041
but I still know cow
poop when I smell it.

178
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,375
What did you just say to me,
you mouthy little brat?

179
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,375
Uh-oh!

180
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,250
You've got a really big mouth

181
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,875
for such a little girl,
don't you?

182
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,083
I'm outta here!

183
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,333
Come back, you!

184
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:31,041
Oh, Kirie. Just tell me
you'll be my big sister.

185
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,083
Fine. I'll be your damn sister.

186
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,875
Oh, what a relief.

187
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,708
I think Fukuyama's finally
given up looking for me.

188
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,750
Ah!

189
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,791
I-Is somebody over there?

190
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,750
Just my imagination.

191
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,083
I need to learn
how to calm down.

192
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:05,583
Ahh!

193
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:12,208
Koyomi!

194
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,583
You can run,
but you can't hide, Koyomi.

195
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:20,250
Now, succumb to my embrace.

196
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:25,125
You must, it is
your... sexual destiny!

197
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,000
Fukuyama!

198
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,333
Huh?

199
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,750
Succumb to destiny... in Hell!

200
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:36,166
Oh, you can pile
drive me next, Miss Kirie.

201
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:40,791
Here, big mouth, how 'bout
we pull that mouth even wider?

202
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,375
Stop already!

203
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,041
If you keep yanking on my face,
it's gonna freeze like that.

204
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,583
Come on, both of you,
just calm down!

205
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,791
Perhaps all of us
should calm down.

206
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,250
Huh?

207
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:04,000
Kirie... are you all right?

208
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,875
Huh? Yukinari!

209
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,458
I'm okay, but what about you?

210
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,541
Miss Kirie!

211
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,166
Oh, Miss Kirie,
I missed you so much.

212
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,000
Get off of me.

213
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,125
You know,
I don't think

214
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,208
all of this is very
good for Yukinari.

215
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:24,541
Oh, well, uh,
sorry Yukinari.

216
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:28,541
Hey! You're not
being very nice to him!

217
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,416
Oh yeah, well you're
being even worse, Lisa!

218
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,000
Yukinari is sick because
of girls like you, so there.

219
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,500
Miss Kirie.

220
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,666
Are you all right?

221
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,666
Oh, Miss Kirie,
I love you so much.

222
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,583
Shut up!

223
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:46,166
Huh?

224
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,791
[YUKINARI whimpering]

225
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,916
Yukinari, what's wrong?

226
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,166
My girl rash... it's gone.

227
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,583
[EVERYONE] What?

228
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,791
Hey, did Short Stuff
finally get over his allergy?

229
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,458
I didn't think it was possible.

230
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,041
How'd you do it?

231
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,041
I don't know.

232
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,958
Maybe I developed
an immunity?

233
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:13,583
Yay!

234
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,416
Get off of him!

235
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,458
Oh calm down!

236
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:17,875
I'm just making sure
my dear Yukinari

237
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,041
is completely
cured, that's all.

238
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,416
Well, how very
selfless of you.

239
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,708
There's still no rash.

240
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,541
Cool! Let's use
Koyo to test him next!

241
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,125
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What do you mean?

242
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,083
I really don't
wanna test anybody.

243
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,416
You're super
afraid of guys, Koyo.

244
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,125
If you don't make
him itchy, then he's cured!

245
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,208
It's for a good cause, Koyo.

246
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,416
Come on! Take one for the team,
and touch him already!

247
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,000
Tomoka! I really don't want to!

248
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,333
Uh, Yukinari?

249
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,791
I... I feel okay.

250
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,625
I feel terrific!

251
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,708
All right!

252
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm home!

253
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:35,000
Oh come on.

254
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:41,958
Hey, Miharu.

255
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,375
I'm glad I ran
in to you, Koyomi.

256
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,000
I went shopping today
and I bought you something.

257
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,291
You'll never guess
what happened!

258
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,958
Yukinari got
over his condition.

259
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,541
Huh?

260
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,166
Thanks everybody!

261
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,875
Congrats, Short Stuff!

262
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,083
Welcome to the world
of touching girls!

263
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,750
Nya nya.

264
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,666
Now there's nothing
standing in the way

265
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,166
of our glorious
predestined love.

266
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,250
Hey Lisa, how 'bout you give
your soul mate a little space?

267
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,666
Let the girl have her fun.

268
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,166
I'm a growing girl,

269
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,083
these are only
going to get bigger.

270
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:26,416
Puny-nari, you're less
of an eunuch than I thought.

271
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,916
You're all happier
about this than I am!

272
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,166
Here! On the house, ninja-boy.

273
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,375
Well, I guess one
wouldn't hurt any--

274
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,333
Oh Kirie--

275
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,375
Hey everyone, having
trouble breathing over here.

276
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,416
See, isn't it great?

277
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:03,791
Uh, Miharu?

278
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:08,375
I'm just gonna
put this stuff away.

279
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,250
Well, hurry back
down all right?

280
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,666
Can it be?

281
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:49,750
Yukinari doesn't
get his girl rash anymore?

282
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:53,250
Now he won't be itchy if
other girls wanna touch him.

283
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,291
And if he wants to
touch other girls he can.

284
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,333
Now he can do
whatever he wants to.

285
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,583
This is great.
It really is.

286
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:05,250
Lisa's crazy about Yukinari,

287
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:09,083
and Kirie has loved him
for a very long time now.

288
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:12,000
Yukinari could never get
too close to them before,

289
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,625
because of his allergy,
but now he's okay.

290
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:19,291
And that's good.
Now that Yukinari's better,

291
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,458
he can spend time
with any girl that he wants.

292
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,750
So why...

293
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:32,000
...why do I feel like crying?

294
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:58,875
Now that he doesn't
itch, does that mean

295
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,208
that I'm not a special
girl to Yukinari anymore?

296
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,583
He's always been special.

297
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,333
Ever since the very
first time I saw him.

298
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:10,625
He's the most special
boy I've ever known.

299
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,458
Nothing can ever change that.

300
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,708
Huh?

301
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,708
It's time to go home, Miharu.

302
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,583
Back to where we belong.

303
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,541
You know in your heart
that you don't belong here.

304
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:52,208
I know... in my heart...
I don't belong here.

305
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,625
Does that mean
that I'm not

306
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,666
a special girl
to Yukinari anymore?

307
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:08,750
It's been so long.
I've waited so patiently.

308
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:16,000
At long last, I have
everything I've ever wanted.

309
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:20,875
You are mine,
dear Miharu, and mine alone.

310
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,750
Miharu's been up there
for a pretty long time.

311
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,875
What? I didn't even
know she was home!

312
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:31,041
Oh yes, she said
she'd come down

313
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,125
after she put some
things in her room.

314
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,583
I have to tell
Miharu the good news.

315
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,916
Aww, just leave
her alone, Yukinari.

316
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,500
I'm sure she'll
be down in a minute.

317
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,791
It can't wait.
Miharu needs to know,

318
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:49,250
because Miharu's
a special girl to me.

319
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:54,041
Yuki... nari.

320
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,625
Miharu!

321
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,125
Huh?

322
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,041
Miharu.

323
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,916
You were always so kind to me.

324
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,208
And you were always smiling.

325
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:35,291
Living with you meant that every
single day was a happy one.

326
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,458
You filled an empty
spot in my heart

327
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,750
I didn't even know I had.

328
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:42,250
Girls Bravo,
season two, next episode,

329
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:45,708
"Bravo to Seiren!"

330
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,083
We were happy then.

331
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:51,791
We could have stayed
that way... forever.
