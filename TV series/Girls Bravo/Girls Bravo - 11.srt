1
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,833
Here we are!

2
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:04,083
It's bath time!

3
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't know, are you sure
we came to the right place?

4
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,708
Let me double check.

5
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,750
Three days, two nights,
at Mountain Hot Spring Inn

6
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,541
for up to five people.

7
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:14,791
Yeah, this is it.

8
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,708
A real popular
place this hot spring.

9
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,750
Isn't this how
horror movies start?

10
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,541
I stand corrected.

11
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,708
There's a light shining
through the trees!

12
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,583
Nobody who likes delicious
food could possibly be evil.

13
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:34,125
No, wait, Miharu!

14
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,166
Yukinari, is that you?

15
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:43,458
Kirie, and Miharu,
Koyomi, and Tomoka.

16
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,666
Don't poor people know
how to knock anymore?

17
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,291
It's so pretty here.

18
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:00,708
Yeah. It kind of makes up
for yesterday being so crazy.

19
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,750
I love a good
bath in the morning.

20
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,291
Whoa! Miharu!

21
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,375
It's a brand new year and
I know it's gonna be great!

22
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,833
It's not New Year's yet, Miharu!

23
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:19,583
Come on girl, put 'em away.

24
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,041
Happy New Year!
More like Happy Nude Year!

25
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:22,958
[MIHARU, TOMO,
and KIRIE laughing]

26
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,666
[KOYOMI sighs]

27
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,708
All right!
I'm here and I'm ready to fish.

28
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,708
Kirie, it's really chilly!

29
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,916
Well, duh,
that's why I did it!

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,541
Tomo didn't start
the water fight,

31
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,791
but Tomo's gonna end it!

32
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,208
[MIHARU, KIRIE,
and TOMO laughing]

33
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,666
Take that! And that!

34
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,708
I give up! No more Tomoka!

35
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,083
I was too freaked out
yesterday to notice...

36
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,708
but this place is pretty nice.

37
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,625
I'm glad we came.

38
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,125
Koyomi?

39
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,083
Any second now...

40
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,750
How do you know
what it's going to do?

41
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,750
Well, I can feel
the bait moving around

42
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,166
on the end of the line,

43
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,166
trying to get
away from the fish.

44
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,833
Fish are pretty predictable.

45
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,083
I still don't get it.

46
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,625
Nya.

47
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,333
Just watch.

48
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
There! The first thing
you do is hold the rod steady.

49
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,583
Keep the fish from moving.

50
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:09,791
You use the rod's flexibility

51
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,291
to lure the fish
toward the rocks.

52
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,625
If you keep
pulling up on it,

53
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,125
you'll see the bait, and then...

54
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,875
...got him!

55
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:19,625
Wow!

56
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:20,416
Wow! That's amazing!

57
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,083
Cool! You caught it!

58
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,916
Nya nya!

59
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,958
What's wrong, Koyomi?

60
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,041
You've been
acting weird all day.

61
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,333
If something's bugging you,
you can tell me.

62
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,666
Hey! Koyomi!

63
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,333
Miharu...

64
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:43,166
Koyomi, Yukinari
is really amazing.

65
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,750
Look at all these fish!

66
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:48,708
He just keeps catching more
of them. I was so surprised.

67
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,291
Does he really?

68
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,166
It's almost like magic.

69
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,166
I don't think that it's magic.

70
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,166
He told me how it works.

71
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,458
You put some tasty bait
on the end of the line

72
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,791
and wait for the fish
to start chasing after it.

73
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,000
I see...

74
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,833
So they chase them.

75
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,875
Is... is something
the matter, Koyomi?

76
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,458
Koyomi, come on.

77
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,833
Something's
really bothering you.

78
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,500
I'm so sorry.

79
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,583
Everyone's
having a good time,

80
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,500
and here I am
ruining it for you two.

81
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,416
Hey now, we're
worried about you,

82
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,375
because you're our friend,
and that's what friends are for.

83
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,916
Kirie...

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,583
Now then, what's going on?

85
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,791
Nya nya nya nya nya nya!

86
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,458
Stop whining Ebi, it'll be fun!

87
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:36,041
Uh, Tomoka, I think your
bait's a little too fresh.

88
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,708
Tomo knows what she's doing!

89
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,750
I'm gonna catch me the biggest
fish you've ever seen!

90
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,666
Oh yeah!

91
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,708
Nyaaah!

92
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,208
Not too bad for
my first time, huh?

93
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:58,375
But up ahead there's a...

94
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,208
Nyaaaah!

95
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,500
He's... nearby.

96
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:03,916
Who's nearby?

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,458
That person.

98
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,750
What person?

99
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,250
Hmph. That person!

100
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,583
Don't sweat it.

101
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,666
If that pervert
shows up again,

102
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,125
I'll kick his ass for you.

103
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,208
That'll teach
him a lesson, right?

104
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,208
I guess so.
Thanks a lot, Kirie.

105
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:23,458
Hey, Kirie.
Are these good to eat?

106
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,583
Miharu, you're so strange.

107
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,916
Am I? I don't feel it.

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,541
Yes. Quite strange.

109
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,083
You're totally strange.

110
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,625
Maybe I am. Oh.

111
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,583
Big Brother!
Nature makes me itchy.

112
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:49,958
Why are we out here anyway?

113
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,041
Don't you fret, Lisa.

114
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:56,000
I think we're in for
a very amusing evening.

115
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,541
We sure had a lot
of fun today, didn't we?

116
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:06,000
Mhmm. The sun was shining.
The water felt great.

117
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,291
And best of all,

118
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,791
there were no nasty
cockroaches to bother us.

119
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,208
Cockroaches?

120
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,458
There aren't really
cockroaches around

121
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,791
the hot springs, are there?

122
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,458
Right, Koyomi?

123
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:21,083
Tomo didn't
catch one single fish.

124
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,583
Ebi is useless!

125
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:27,291
Nya...

126
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,750
You know, I was pretty
surprised, Yukinari...

127
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,541
I never knew you were
so good at fishing!

128
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah, you're amazing, Yukinari!

129
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,500
When I was younger,

130
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,541
my dad and I used to
go fishing all the time.

131
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,125
Yukinari and I have been
friends ever since we were kids,

132
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:52,041
but there are still lots of
things I don't know about him.

133
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,708
You looked really cool doing it.

134
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,916
Maybe you're not so useless.

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,541
Thanks... I think.

136
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,500
Yukinari, you're such
a little sleezeball!

137
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,916
Go drown in Hell!

138
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,791
You really shouldn't be
so rough with him, Kirie.

139
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,166
It's okay,
I'll just have to nurse

140
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,000
my poor broken soul mate
back to health.

141
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,416
Huh?

142
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,416
Lisa?

143
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,708
What the hell?

144
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,083
Huh? Fukuyama!

145
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,208
Who else?

146
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,583
I hope my co-ed bath
is to your liking.

147
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,541
What did you say?

148
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,250
You bought the damn hotel?!

149
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,541
Yes. Why not? We're rich.

150
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:57,208
We bought every hot springs
hotel in the area.

151
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,041
From now on,
this place will be called

152
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,416
the Fukuyamaville
Hot Springs Resort.

153
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,958
Right, old woman?

154
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:06,208
That's a wonderful idea,
Master Kazuharu.

155
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,541
It's very rare to find such

156
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,250
sound business sense
in one still so young.

157
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,000
Don't fall for it, landlady.

158
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,458
He's acting nice right now,

159
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,416
but you don't
know him like we do.

160
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,541
How could you
let him have his way?

161
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,791
It was simple, dearie.

162
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,375
Ah! She's gonna eat me!

163
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,791
Yukinari, are you
feeling any better?

164
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:30,916
Come on! Just leave us
alone for a few days, Fukuyama!

165
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,791
We're on vacation!

166
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:37,500
It's my hotel. I can make
the bath co-ed if I want to.

167
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,625
How can you be
so damn selfish!

168
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,625
What is wrong with you?

169
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,458
Maybe if you'd
invited us along,

170
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,916
we wouldn't be at
this dreadful impasse.

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,125
Why would we?

172
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,750
All you and your
screwy sister ever do

173
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,958
is try to get into our pants!

174
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:54,625
Well, which came first,
the chicken or the egg?

175
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,125
The egg.
Or was Mr. Chicken first?

176
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:02,791
Whatever. How about we
settle this fair and square.

177
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,000
How's that?

178
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,375
[KIRIE screams]

179
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,666
Big Brother wins
eleven to zero. It's over!

180
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,000
Well, I guess that's settled.

181
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,166
That was cool.

182
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,625
I mean, I never
would have guessed

183
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,541
that that big dumb pervert
was so handy with a paddle.

184
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,291
Fukuyama, what
kind of man are you?

185
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,916
You only beat me
because Lisa used her magic.

186
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You cheated!

187
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,333
Obviously.

188
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,625
If I'd lost, I'd have to
return my beloved hot spring

189
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,375
to how it was,
and stay two miles away

190
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,041
from Miharu and Koyomi
for a whole week.

191
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,541
With stakes that high,
of course I'm going to cheat!

192
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,666
What happened to
"fair and square"?

193
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,666
Those were your words, not mine.

194
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,166
Wha--?

195
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:13,000
Anyway, it's time
to make good on your bet.

196
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,416
Huh? Human body-brush?

197
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,416
You're a dirty boy!

198
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,541
Fukuyama, let's play again!
Best two out of three.

199
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,125
I would just beat you again.

200
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,541
Go ahead and prove it
if you're so damn cocky.

201
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:33,208
I wonder what part of me
I should have you wash first?

202
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,208
I'll be dead in
the cold, cold ground

203
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,833
before I do a human
body-brush on you!

204
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,791
When a person
really wants something,

205
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,416
they use the magic word.

206
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,916
Don't they, Kirie?

207
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,916
Please. Give me a rematch.

208
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,416
Huh?

209
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,541
Oh, generous Fukuyama,

210
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,000
I beg of you, play me again.

211
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,500
And after you lose?

212
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,458
If I lose again,
I'll do whatever you want.

213
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,125
I promise!

214
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,625
All right. It's a deal.

215
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,958
Really?

216
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,500
However, I think it's time
that we upped the ante.

217
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,916
If you lose, you have
to be my bath time mate

218
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,916
for the rest of my life!

219
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,166
What?!

220
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,833
Ooh. Rub a dub dub.

221
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,708
Um, isn't there anything
else you'd rather have?

222
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,875
There's always Plan 'A'.

223
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,625
All right,
all right, I get it.

224
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,250
I agree to your condition.

225
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:29,750
Very well. Let's get
this rematch underway.

226
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,375
Puny-nari.

227
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,750
Yukinari?

228
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:34,750
Wait a minute!

229
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:35,875
What does he have
to do with this?

230
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,083
Correct me if I'm
wrong, and I'm not,

231
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,958
but I never said who
my opponent would be.

232
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:42,208
No fair. Yukinari's hurt
right now, and you know it.

233
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,458
And just whose
fault would that be?

234
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:50,000
I-I can do it, Kirie.

235
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,416
Yukinari...

236
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,208
But you can hardly walk.

237
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,583
I-I'll be okay,
don't worry.

238
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,083
What?

239
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,708
I felt pretty confident when
I was fishing earlier today.

240
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,833
Maybe there's a bit of it left.

241
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,458
Yukinari...

242
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:05,708
Okay, then.

243
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,000
And because
I'm feeling generous,

244
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,000
I'll even let
him have a partner.

245
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,333
Really?

246
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,875
Ooh, me! That game
looks like lots of fun!

247
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,333
Anybody but you.

248
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,541
Oh.

249
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:16,750
When you get over-excited,

250
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,166
you have a tendency
to make things explode.

251
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,541
Puny-nari's partner will be...

252
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,500
Pick Tomo! I know
you're not too smart,

253
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,000
but this should be
a no-brainer, even for you.

254
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,375
Hmm.

255
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,333
Koyomi's the obvious choice!

256
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,250
What?! But I don't wanna play!

257
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,333
Hey, that's not fair, Fukuyama.

258
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,625
You can't pick Koyomi,

259
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,166
you know how
scared she is of you.

260
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,541
Don't burst a blood
vessel, Puny-nari,

261
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,166
I just agreed to let the two
of you team up against me.

262
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,583
You should be thankful.

263
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,833
I'll do it.

264
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm going to play. I want to.

265
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,166
It's okay, Koyomi,
don't force yourself.

266
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,208
But... I-I want to
help out for a change.

267
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,875
And I'll do my best.

268
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,000
Koyomi...

269
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,208
Please let me!

270
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,041
All right.
Let's give it our all.

271
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,500
Yeah!

272
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,500
New rule: if Koyomi's
on the losing team,

273
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,125
there's an
additional consequence.

274
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,500
What?

275
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,375
A fun dinner party dish,

276
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:21,500
aptly named Fruit Salad
à la Koyomi.

277
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,125
Look at those melons.

278
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,166
[KOYOMI whimpers]

279
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:31,000
Koyomi! Koyomi,
you have to snap out of it!

280
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:34,166
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

281
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,291
No, if that's
the rule, I accept!

282
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,250
Koyomi!

283
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,291
Sassy, I like.

284
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,916
We're not gonna lose!
Just you wait!

285
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:53,125
Just don't come
crying when I beat you.

286
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,333
Okay, let's get started.

287
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,083
I'm sorry, Yukinari.

288
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,416
Blood is thicker than ping-pong.

289
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,666
I have to root for
Big Brother this time.

290
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,750
But my heart will always
be on your side of the net.

291
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:12,291
If I remember how it felt
to go fishing, I'll be okay.

292
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,500
Concentrate. Concentrate!

293
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,250
Take that!

294
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,125
Fine! Bring it on!

295
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,333
Uh. Yukinari?

296
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,541
I almost feel bad.

297
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,125
Are you okay?

298
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,416
Yukinari...

299
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,750
Anyone have a maid
outfit I can borrow?

300
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,541
All of a sudden we're
looking at a singles match.

301
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,458
Shall we continue,
sweet Koyomi?

302
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,625
I can have that
fruit ready in a snap.

303
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,666
Now, Koyomi, let's
get down to business!

304
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,500
Hah!

305
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,500
What?

306
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:54,833
All right.

307
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:55,791
Amazing.

308
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,000
No way!

309
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,875
Well, I must not have been
paying any attention just then.

310
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:06,791
It won't happen again, Koyomi.

311
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:11,083
That was just a fluke,
yeah, that's it.

312
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,375
Koyomi, you're awesome!

313
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,166
Koyomi, you looked really cool!

314
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,541
I think the basic
idea's the same.

315
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,666
I knew this game would
be right up Koyo's alley.

316
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,166
But how could you
have known? Tell me!

317
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,833
It's a little different
from Earth ping-pong,

318
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:29,250
but we have a game on
Seiren called Pan Pon Pin.

319
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,958
Koyo's won the tournament
five years in a row!

320
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,166
Really?
That means there's no way

321
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,208
Fukuyama can beat her, right?

322
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,375
Lisa... magic time.

323
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,000
Hmph.

324
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,875
Curses.
Who would've ever guessed

325
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:03,000
that Koyomi was a veritable
ping-pong Valkyrie?

326
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,208
I wanted to win
by skill alone,

327
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,875
but desperate times
call for desperate measures.

328
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,750
Project S.

329
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,041
I love you.

330
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,750
Who's your daddy?

331
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,958
Fukuyama!
You're just a cheating coward!

332
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,666
I-I'm sorry. I can't...

333
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,125
Look at her shaking like
a winsome full-breasted leaf.

334
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,041
The sexual
harassment is working.

335
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,250
All I have to do is keep
talking, and victory is mine!

336
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,666
Let's get married!

337
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,458
Work that kimono, baby!

338
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:41,833
Oh, what a wonderful bra!
I can totally see it!

339
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:45,541
No, don't say any more!
I just can't take it!

340
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,625
And what color panties?

341
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,000
Let's see now, if I remember,

342
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,625
Koyomi's bra and panties
are both blue-ish green.

343
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:52,750
No!

344
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:57,125
Miharu, why are
you telling him that?

345
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:01,041
I'm sorry. I forgot
about the polka dots, huh?

346
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,250
Please, make it stop.

347
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,791
Get a hold of yourself, Koyomi!

348
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,083
You can't give up now!
If you lose this match,

349
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,625
that cheating pervert's gonna
serve you up like a fruit salad!

350
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,458
You'll never stop
being afraid of him!

351
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,625
And I really don't want
to be his damn loofah.

352
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:23,666
It's terrible,
I know, but I... I...

353
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,791
It's not over until
the fat lady sings.

354
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:26,458
Just pretend that ping-pong
ball is Fukuyama and hit it!

355
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:30,833
Fukuyama's the ball?

356
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:34,666
Koyomi... kiss me!

357
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,833
[FUKUYAMA] Woo woo woo woo...

358
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:42,833
No! I hate pushy men!

359
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:47,333
I hit it! And the ball looked
exactly like Fukuyama's face!

360
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,041
Yes! It actually worked!
Keep it up, Koyomi!

361
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,083
It's nine all!
Your serve, Koyomi.

362
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,833
I won't lose!
Not to you, pervert!

363
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,833
I'm not losing today!

364
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:13,250
Behold my last weapon,
my plentiful balls!

365
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,291
No... means no!

366
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,208
That's it!

367
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,083
Koyomi wins!
Nineteen to nine!

368
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,000
Yeah! You did it!
You won the match, Koyomi!

369
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:32,125
Koyomi, you were amazing!

370
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,166
I couldn't have
done it without you.

371
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:39,625
Woah. I don't think his
balls will ever be the same.

372
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,083
Nya. Nya. Nya. Nya...

373
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,541
Hey! One more match!
Double or nothing!

374
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:51,666
Or the winner could
scrub the loser's back.

375
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,958
Come on, Kirie,
what do ya think?

376
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,166
Good idea?

377
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,458
Ah! I'm boiling in here,
let me out already.

378
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,916
Why'd I even
bother coming here?

379
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,083
This feels really good.

380
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,916
Yeah, it's very
relaxing in here.

381
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,333
I think this hot spring
is the best of 'em all.

382
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,916
You said it!
The perfect end to a long day.

383
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,916
Hey, Koyomi, come and join us!

384
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,791
Yes!

385
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,958
Nya nya!

386
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,583
Hey!
