[ANNOUNCER]
Now, tomorrow's horoscope:

2
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,666
Aries, bad luck
awaits you outside,

3
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,375
so stay at home and relax.

4
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,583
Taurus, you're in
for a rocky day, too.

5
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:13,000
Just go with the flow.

6
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,708
Gemini, wearing
a silver bracelet

7
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,291
can really increase
your productivity at work.

8
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,625
No handcuffs though!

9
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,000
Next, Cancer,
a vase of Dandelions

10
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,000
on the window sill
brings financial gain,

11
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,291
and Leo, you are
one lucky girl!

12
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,583
Keep your eyes peeled for
a checkered handkerchief,

13
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,666
a bandaged face,
and a Killty keychain.

14
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,416
If you find somebody
with all three,

15
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,583
they're your soul mate!

16
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,041
My... soul mate?

17
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,291
All done.

18
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,041
What's wrong, Puny-nari?

19
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,875
You got something to say, Puny?

20
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:05,250
Uh, no,
not really. I just-

21
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,458
You're too much of
a coward to talk back.

22
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,125
If you're a man,
then act like one!

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,958
[YUKINARI panting]

24
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:20,958
[YUKINARI yelps in surprise]

25
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,125
Time to start
the day, Yukinari.

26
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,458
Miharu...

27
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,875
It's morning, and that
means it's breakfast time.

28
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,625
Breakfast?

29
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:33,250
Yeah. We're having white rice,
homemade miso soup,

30
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:37,083
and an omelet filled with lots
of vitamins from Mr. Chicken.

31
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,916
Mister?

32
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,125
All that food will push the bad
dreams right out of your head.

33
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,000
Miharu...

34
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,375
I still need to get ready,

35
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,833
so please, go ahead
and start breakfast without me.

36
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,333
Get ready?

37
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,958
Oh yeah... this'll be your
first day of school, won't it?

38
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,041
Uh-huh!
Well, you better hurry up!

39
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,958
Your food is getting cold.

40
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,291
Um, Miharu?

41
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,666
Huh?

42
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,625
Thank you. You know,
for being so patient with me.

43
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,541
I'm sure I'll get over
this phobia sooner or later.

44
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,583
[MIHARU giggles]

45
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,125
[YURIKUMA] Miharu accidentally
wandered to Earth,

46
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,791
from her home planet of Seiren-

47
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,583
a world of almost all women.

48
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,541
After what happened before,

49
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:23,000
it didn't seem smart to leave
her home alone all day.

50
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,458
Instead, she'll go
to school with us.

51
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:32,125
Fukuyama convinced the principal
to let her in right away...

52
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:38,875
without having to deal
with the usual red tape.

53
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,875
Though I'm still a little
worried, I mean it is Fukuyama.

54
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,541
I have to protect Miharu against
people like that.

55
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,833
But first, the breakfast Miharu
prepared especially for me!

56
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:59,041
I knew it. Well, she did
make me breakfast, sort of.

57
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,625
Thank you for the food!

58
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:07,000
Hey, this is pretty good.
Hmm, delicious.

59
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:12,208
Um, Yukinari,
does it taste all right?

60
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,333
Oh, yeah, it's terrific!

61
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,708
Do you really mean it?

62
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,500
You sure know your way
around the kitchen, Miharu!

63
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,666
Thank you very much!

64
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,208
You know, all that food

65
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,000
you made for me on
Seiren was terrific, too.

66
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,625
I'm so happy to
hear that you liked it.

67
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,541
If only there were just
a little bit more of it...

68
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:33,083
Oh, sorry about that.

69
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,541
I nibbled at it to check
the flavor, and when I stopped--

70
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh no, don't worry about it.

71
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,291
Too much food would have
been bad for me, anyway.

72
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:44,083
Food is bad for
you if you eat too much?

73
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,500
Is that true?

74
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:49,541
Oh, ow ow ow!

75
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:50,625
I'm having a little trouble

76
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:54,208
getting into
these Earth clothes.

77
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,875
Wah!

78
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,125
Yukinari, what's the matter?!

79
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,916
Miharu, what do you
think you're doing?!

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,791
I think I'm changing.

81
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,000
Ch-ch-ch-changing?

82
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,833
If you're changing,
why are you naked?

83
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,166
Is naked bad?

84
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,083
It's not that it's bad...

85
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,125
but if Kirie
sees us like this...

86
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,041
Oh, Kirie, good morning.

87
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,666
Yukinari?

88
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,833
Yeah?

89
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,333
Why is it morning after morning,

90
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:31,583
after morning, after morning,
after morning she's naked?!

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,333
Does it hurt much, Yukinari?

92
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah, well, just a little bit.

93
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,458
Oh, your lip,
there's blood on it.

94
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:44,458
It's not that bad.

95
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,416
I'm fine.

96
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,625
Here. Use this.

97
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,583
You wouldn't be bleeding
if I hadn't hit you so hard.

98
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,625
I have two, so... you can
keep this one if you want to.

99
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,625
Thanks a lot, Kirie.

100
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:02,333
Uh, what, I didn't
mean anything by it!

101
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,625
Oh, me next!

102
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,416
I have a present to
give Yukinari also.

103
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,166
A present?

104
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,750
Oh, wow, it's a...

105
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,083
It's your very own Killty doll.

106
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,333
Killty, huh?

107
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,458
Yeah.

108
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,708
[KILLTY] I love you.
I hold you. I kill you.

109
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,208
Neat, huh?

110
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,291
I found him in a shop just
yesterday, isn't he the cutest?

111
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,083
Yeah, uh...

112
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,416
Here, I'll put him on.

113
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,708
[LISA] A checkered handkerchief,

114
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:34,458
a bandage on his face,
a Killty keychain...

115
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,750
Yukinari?

116
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,583
Ow. Ow.

117
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,291
I'm sorry about
that, Miss. I didn't--

118
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,750
Huh?

119
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:57,875
N-n-now I'm really sorry.
Are you hurt?

120
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,791
A bandage on your face,
checkered handkerchief...

121
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,750
Killty keychain...

122
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,833
I found you! My soul mate!

123
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,666
[MIHARU and KIRIE] Yukinari!

124
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,125
Oh, this is definitely more
than some mere coincidence!

125
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,625
This is no chance encounter!

126
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,666
No, it's the hand of fate!

127
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,291
I am the absolute luckiest
girl in the universe

128
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,291
to have Mabanya shower
such blessings down on me.

129
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,625
I'm so thankful.

130
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,833
Yukinari, snap out of it!

131
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,500
Let's take him
to the nurse's office.

132
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,833
--[KIRIE] Come on.
--[MIHARU] Okay.

133
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,500
Oh, Miharu,
grab his bag.

134
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,416
Right.

135
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,000
...And I owe it
all to black magic.

136
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,625
This is a thank you

137
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,166
from the netherworld
for my faithful service.

138
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,875
Oh, Mabanya, please watch
us from your unholy domain

139
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,916
as my soul mate and
I walk hand-in-hand

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,416
through our life together.

141
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,125
I just know that
I'll be blissfully happy

142
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:59,000
with my soul mate, my...

143
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,416
Oh, in the excitement
of the moment,

144
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,625
I didn't even ask for his name.

145
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,875
I can be so stupid,
stupid, stupid!

146
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,541
Please, my love,
may I have your name?

147
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,625
Hayate. Kosame.

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,083
[HAYATE] Did you summon us?

149
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,291
[KOSAME] Mistress?

150
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,958
The uniform that
man was wearing,

151
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:24,583
it seems we both attend
Mizuno High School, does it not?

152
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,583
Yes.

153
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,875
Then you know
what must be done.

154
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,500
Do you understand?

155
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,833
Quite, my mistress.

156
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,791
I love you. I hold you.
I kill you.

157
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,041
My soul mate.
You're not going anywhere.

158
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,750
I'm so wiped out.

159
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,500
Will you be all right,
Yukinari?

160
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,458
Well, you did have yourself
kind of a tough morning.

161
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,875
Ah, it could've been worse.

162
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,666
Least Fukuyama's
not here today.

163
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,750
I wonder what
happened to Fukuyama.

164
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,250
I really wanted to
thank him for convincing

165
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,750
the principal to let me go
to school with the two of you.

166
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:16,708
I don't know, he's not the type
that skips out on class...

167
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,041
The silence is
kind of weird, huh?

168
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,458
And speaking of weird,

169
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,291
the blond girl
from this morning...

170
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,750
Who let her out
of the nuthouse?

171
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,458
Kirie!

172
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,125
Fu... kuyama?

173
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:33,708
Kirie, I need you to tell me
more about that girl you met.

174
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,416
Where did you see her?

175
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,875
Tell me, Kirie!

176
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,125
What's the matter, Kirie?
Answer me!

177
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,208
Answer me, Kirie!

178
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,041
Ask your questions in Hell!!

179
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,250
[bell dings]

180
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,291
[KIRIE panting]

181
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,666
So...

182
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,791
Tell me a little bit more
about that girl, Kirie.

183
00:10:58,875 --> 00:10:59,958
Gross.

184
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,208
What exactly was she like?
Extremely cute?

185
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,250
Yeah, she kept
going on about Mabanya

186
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:09,208
and how Yukinari is her
destined mate or something.

187
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,791
What?!

188
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,041
Gross.

189
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,833
A little longer,
just a little longer,

190
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:21,291
and I'll be joined
with my soul mate.

191
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,708
Oh, Mabanya,
lend me your strength,

192
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:28,250
so that I may have
success in this endeavor.

193
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,625
Ah! My future husband!
I'm crazy with waiting!

194
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,250
Puny-nari, you little bastard,
what did you do to her?

195
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,291
Well, I don't remember anything,
because I was unconscious.

196
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,916
Don't try and
hide it from me!

197
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,083
Hide what?
I don't know anything!

198
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,625
Fukuyama...

199
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,375
Chill out Fukuyama.

200
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,708
Target is acquired.

201
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,583
Kosame, are you ready?

202
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,583
Always.

203
00:11:58,708 --> 00:11:59,083
Four.

204
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,458
Three.

205
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,041
Two.

206
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,708
One.

207
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,250
Zero.

208
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,125
What's happening?

209
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,166
An ambush!

210
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,041
Could it be?

211
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,000
My eyes!

212
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:25,958
My eyes, oh, and my ears!

213
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:32,375
Target neutralized.
Time to head out.

214
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,666
Hey, you.

215
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,583
Where do you think
you're taking Yukinari, huh?

216
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,458
And who might you be?

217
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,833
I'll ask the questions!

218
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,708
The audacity of
attacking us at a school!

219
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:54,208
There's absolutely no way
you're gonna get away with this!

220
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,291
Lovely.

221
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,000
Why you!

222
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:12,791
Too bad. We'll have to
start from here next time.

223
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,833
What the hell was that about?

224
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,833
Kirie, where is Yukinari?

225
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,875
It was them...
no doubt about it.

226
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,541
Huh? Fukuyama, wait!

227
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,666
Where are you going?!

228
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,916
Hey!

229
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,583
Oh please, let me outta here!

230
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,708
What are you going
to do with me?!

231
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,583
Yukinari Sasaki,
Mizuno High School second year.

232
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,833
His extreme fear of
women manifests itself

233
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,375
in an allergic reaction
whenever he's touched by one.

234
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,041
He's allergic?

235
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,458
Yes.

236
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,666
With the sole exception
of a girl named Miharu,

237
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,583
who currently resides with him,

238
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,625
all women who
touch him trigger it.

239
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,333
My poor dear that's terrible.

240
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,625
But don't worry...
your days of suffering are over.

241
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,416
I'm going to cure your disease

242
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,083
with some demonic
assistance, that is.

243
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:10,291
Lisa!

244
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,833
Hmm? Oh, hey.

245
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,958
Lisa! So this is where
you've been hiding!

246
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,750
You! You're from this morning!

247
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:17,916
Yukinari!

248
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,125
You know each other?

249
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,791
I couldn't find you, Lisa!

250
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,458
You don't know how
much a brother worries!

251
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,000
Brother?

252
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,041
Oh, Lisa,
I've never known such pain!

253
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,375
Your brother?

254
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,041
Uh-huh.

255
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,333
Allow me to introduce myself,

256
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,791
I'm Lisa Fukuyama,

257
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,375
and this is my first
year at high school!

258
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:42,791
And to my left are my trusty
servants, Hayate and Kosame.

259
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,250
They've been
my private body guards

260
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,791
ever since I was a baby,
and they do my bidding.

261
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:48,875
Bidding... huh.

262
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,500
Well, it's been
fun chatting with you.

263
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,708
Lisa! You've been locking
yourself in your room

264
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:58,083
for months going
on and on about Mabanya.

265
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,166
Then you just
disappear this morning,

266
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,625
and I find you
cozying up to Puny-nari?!

267
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,708
It's more than a brother
should have to bear!

268
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,166
Lisa!

269
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,458
Um, excuse me.

270
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,041
Why did you have
your bidders kidnap

271
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,750
Yukinari in the first place?

272
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:17,500
Oh, why you ask?
Well, it's simple.

273
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,416
We're going to
have a ceremony

274
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,583
to join my soul mate and me
in unholy matrimony!

275
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,375
Lisa!

276
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,250
Marriage?!

277
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,791
Mat-ri-mo-ny?

278
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,500
What is this?
You don't get to decide for him.

279
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,208
Ceremony?

280
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,375
Yeah, ya see it's when, uh...

281
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,541
If you'd like to participate,

282
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:42,458
please keep your arms and
legs outside of the pentagram.

283
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,708
Wh-What's happening?

284
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,125
Spirits of the darkness,

285
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,375
creatures of
the eldritch beyond,

286
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,125
in the name
of Lisa Fukuyama,

287
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,041
show yourselves to me!

288
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,625
Sanctify my marriage
with your presence!

289
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,041
Don't do it, Lisa!

290
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,000
[FUKUYUAMA] I don't
think I can live in a world

291
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,500
where Puny-nari
is my brother-in-law.

292
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:23,166
Now, dear Yukinari...

293
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,666
Our infernal union.

294
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,958
Sealed with a kiss.

295
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,416
Huh?

296
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,208
This can't be possible!

297
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,125
My poor broken Yukinari.

298
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,708
It's mostly your
fault that he's broken!

299
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,083
Hey! She's the one
you should be blaming!

300
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:13,791
She ruined everything with some
sort of funky pink-haired magic!

301
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:17,583
Now, Lisa! Don't talk
to Miharu like that!

302
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,708
And anyway, why Puny-nari?

303
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,708
Haven't I told you
before I'd be happy

304
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,208
to find the
perfect guy for you?

305
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:28,000
If you continue interfering

306
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,666
with my destined love match,
I'll never forgive you.

307
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,083
But... but I didn't--

308
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,416
Hey, wait, hold on!

309
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,916
Look, I don't know how
you got it into your head

310
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,583
that Yukinari
was the guy for you,

311
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,958
but trust me on this,
it wouldn't work out.

312
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:47,708
Because... Yukinari
is afraid of women.

313
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,958
So! How come she
gets to chase him?

314
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:53,041
Miss Lisa, this is
the girl I told you about.

315
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,500
The one named Miharu.

316
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,666
Miharu?

317
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,750
Yes, the one female
who doesn't trigger

318
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,583
Yukinari's allergic reaction.

319
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:03,166
Oh. I see.

320
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,083
So, now that you get it,
you can go home, right?

321
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,958
But I'm not finished yet!

322
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,458
Yukinari's hurt.

323
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:13,916
Just leave the poor
guy alone already.

324
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,041
Oh yeah, and don't
forget to pick up

325
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:21,083
your unconscious pervert
brother on your way out.

326
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,625
What? Where am I? I don't...

327
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:41,000
What? What? What?!

328
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,875
Uh, hey, what?

329
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,625
I'm so glad
you could make it.

330
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,083
Are you feeling
any better, Yukinari?

331
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,583
I sure hope so.

332
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,000
Fukuyama's sister?

333
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,083
Hey, now.

334
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,875
No need to call me
Fukuyama's sister,

335
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,375
like we're strangers.

336
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,250
Please, call me Lisa.

337
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:03,666
Okay, but what is all this?

338
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,583
Oh, you mean
the full-course meal?

339
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:10,041
I pulled a few strings and
borrowed the cooking classroom.

340
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,083
I thought that a special dinner
might help with your recovery.

341
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,750
Uh, special how?

342
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:20,458
Yeah, ya know...

343
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm really
not that hungry.

344
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,791
I mean, I am...
I'm really, really hungry!

345
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:30,416
Well then.
I should get you a plate!

346
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:39,916
Now Yukinari, there's plenty
of everything, so dig in.

347
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,083
Okay.

348
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,291
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

349
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:49,500
Well then... here I go!

350
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,458
Delicious.

351
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:54,916
Of course, silly.

352
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,458
When it comes to home cooking,
Lisa's the best!

353
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,375
I also made duck blood,

354
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:03,958
deep fried scorpions,
and royal jelly with bee larva.

355
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,750
Not only does
it taste wonderful,

356
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,958
but it's really good for you.

357
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,625
By the way, Yukinari, dear.

358
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,916
Hmm?

359
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,333
Is it true what they say?

360
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,125
That you have this
condition that flares up

361
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,958
if you get too
close to a woman?

362
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,458
Afraid so.

363
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,041
That is absolutely tragic.

364
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:25,375
To have you right here
and be denied your embrace.

365
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,958
I guess... sure.

366
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,541
But don't you worry.

367
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,541
I came up with
a great new idea

368
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,583
on how to banish your
woman phobia forever!

369
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,958
Um, your idea... tell me
it won't involve demons.

370
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,458
Goodness no!

371
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,375
Just forget about all that
black magic this afternoon.

372
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,375
Phew.

373
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,750
You see, my dear Yukinari,

374
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,125
the whole reason
I prepared this meal

375
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,875
was to help you try
and kick your allergy.

376
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,750
But... how will it help?

377
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,791
Most conditions
can be reversed...

378
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:58,208
if you know
what you're doing.

379
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,541
Huh?

380
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,291
Chinese medicine believes
that like cures like.

381
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,041
It's pretty simple.

382
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,916
If you have stomach troubles,
you eat a stomach.

383
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,583
If your liver's bad,
you eat a liver.

384
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:10,666
Huh.

385
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,875
The point is...
since touching a woman

386
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,541
makes you
break out in a rash,

387
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:21,958
what better cure
than a woman's touch?

388
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:26,333
Now, Yukinari.

389
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,583
Enjoy me.
It's time for dessert.

390
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,666
Yukinari, get back
here and fondle me!

391
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,625
This is your destiny!
Mabanya told me so!

392
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,791
I have no clue
what you're talking about!

393
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:44,791
Yukinari dearest, I adore you.
I'm yours for the taking!

394
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,625
No thank you!

395
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:53,291
Oh, Brother. Sorry I had
to put you in there,

396
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,458
but I couldn't let
you interfere with us.

397
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,041
Yukinari and I are in love,

398
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,625
and nothing's going
to get in the way of that.

399
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,125
Wah!

400
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:05,500
Yukinari! Yukinari, wait!

401
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,833
I know that you love me!

402
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,625
I'm not giving up!

403
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,625
I did mention you're
my soul mate, right?!

404
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,875
I'm home.

405
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,708
Today was just too much.

406
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,833
Miharu?

407
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,708
Oh, Yukinari, welcome home.

408
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,291
You waited up for me?

409
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,625
Yeah, I thought that
maybe you'd be hungry,

410
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:37,416
so I prepared
dinner for you.

411
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,583
Hmm. I see.

412
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,916
Sorry about that.

413
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,583
I was making it, and then
I got really, really hungry.

414
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,041
I tried.

415
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,250
So, let's eat.

416
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,875
Okay. Oh, I'll serve
you some soup...

417
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:04,083
Well, whatever's
left of it that is.

418
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:04,916
Um, Yukinari?

419
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah?

420
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,958
Sorry I dropped
a demon on you.

421
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,708
Don't worry about it,
everything worked out.

422
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:11,833
You really mean it?

423
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:12,833
Sure do.

424
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:16,000
Good!

425
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:16,875
Dig in!

426
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,541
Yeah.
