1
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:04,291
My name... is
Yukinari Sasaki.

2
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,333
I'm just your average
high school student.

3
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,666
Except for being
allergic to women

4
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,291
and breaking out in a rash
whenever one touched me,

5
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:14,208
my day-to-day life
was pretty quiet.

6
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:17,291
But ever since that day
I was transported to Seiren,

7
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,375
a planet of almost all women,

8
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,958
my life has changed completely.

9
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,708
That's where I met Miharu,

10
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,458
the one girl
I'm not allergic to.

11
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,500
She came back to earth
with me somehow,

12
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,750
and now we live together.

13
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,375
There's also my
best friend, Kirie;

14
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,750
Fukuyama, our resident pervert;

15
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,541
his kooky sister, Lisa;

16
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,458
and some other
visitors from Seiren:

17
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,125
Koyomi, who's afraid of men;

18
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,833
Tomoka who's a legend
in her own mind;

19
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,458
and Ebi, our
extra-terrestrial pet.

20
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,333
Life is anything but boring.

21
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:51,916
I wonder what else
is in store for me.

22
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:12,291
Hey, you, lookin' good!

23
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:22,708
You did remember to send that
letter to Koyomi, didn't you?

24
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,875
[LILICA] Indeed, just
as you ordered, Master.

25
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,458
Today... today I finally get

26
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,416
both Miharu and Koyomi at once!

27
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,166
All of my scheming...
it's about to bear fruit!

28
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,041
Two in one blow.

29
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:02,083
Wow! It's really big!

30
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,750
I've been looking forward to

31
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,833
today's swim class
for a long time!

32
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,208
Yeah, it's just
the thing on a hot day!

33
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,375
Right! Come on,
Kirie, let's go.

34
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,791
What's the hurry, Miharu?

35
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,083
Hey, look.

36
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,958
The pool's not going anywhere.

37
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,083
Damn. Miharu is totally hot.

38
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,375
Even in one of those
school swimsuits!

39
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,750
Yeah, Kirie, too.

40
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,416
Not too shabby, huh guys?

41
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,708
How come there's a hole
in my swimsuit, Kirie?

42
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,625
Oh yeah, that's just there to--

43
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,291
There's a hole
in yours too, Kirie!

44
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,666
It's like a pocket!

45
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,833
Miharu get your
arms out of my suit!

46
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,708
Oh, they both went in!

47
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,250
This swimsuit's
really stretchy.

48
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,791
That's not what
it's there for!

49
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:46,916
The hole just lets the water
that comes in through the top

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,458
go out through
the bottom, okay?

51
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,833
That's amazing, Kirie!

52
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,916
Let's go, Miharu.

53
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,916
Before their trunks
get any tighter.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,833
Sorry I'm late!
My locker's too tall!

55
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,000
Sorry! Sorry!
It was an accident!

56
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:17,375
What's this thing
doing here, anyway?

57
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,166
Huh?

58
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,166
Hey, they're all
over the place...

59
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,333
Oh no, Yukinari,
are you all right?

60
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:30,625
Geez, Yukinari
can be such a clutz.

61
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,625
Surf's up!

62
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,916
Fukuyama, that's amazing!

63
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,541
You can't ride
that thing in a pool!

64
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:45,875
Come on!

65
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,541
Thanks to an unexpected
illness,

66
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,291
our teacher can't make it
today.

67
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,250
My goodness, what
happened?

68
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,083
Just tell me where it hurts,
honey.

69
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,291
My stomach. It came so
fast.

70
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,708
Hang in there,
okay?

71
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,958
I'll take you over to the
nurse's office right away.

72
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,583
Ah! The
baby!

73
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,625
What?

74
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,000
It's coming! It's coming!

75
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:09,833
Wait a minute, do you
even go to this school?

76
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,875
There's only one thing to
do in a time like this...

77
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,458
Ready when you are, Kirie!

78
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,916
Woo-hoo!

79
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:30,833
All right, ladies.
It's pool party time.

80
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,333
What are you talking about?

81
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,166
You can't just throw a party
because the teacher's gone.

82
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,833
And you floozies on the raft,

83
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,500
what are you doing
wearing those bikinis?

84
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,916
Enjoy, Miharu.
And for Kirie, the white.

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,125
Feel free to lose these

86
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,583
as you experience
the wonders of my pool.

87
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,750
Wow, I didn't know the school
had swimsuits like that.

88
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,500
They don't!

89
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,541
Those are his!

90
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,291
What are you babbling about?
This isn't your pool!

91
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,500
Do you know
how stupid you are?

92
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh, it's mine.

93
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,833
I had this sudden
inexplicable interest

94
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,208
in the high school swim team,

95
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,916
so the Fukuyama family
paid to remodel the pool.

96
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,625
Wait, your family did what?!

97
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,166
Good grades depend on
a good learning environment,

98
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,625
and I'd rather do my learning
poolside at a resort.

99
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,833
What's going on?!

100
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,458
You... you didn't.

101
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,625
And the coup de grace.

102
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,000
Goodbye hapless rivals.

103
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,166
Hello exclusive harem oasis.

104
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,833
Whatever you're planning,
Fukuyama, just forget it.

105
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,666
I've already had
enough stupidity

106
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,333
out of you for one day.

107
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,125
Kirie, there's plenty of time

108
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,708
for talking you out
of that one-piece later.

109
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,041
'Til then, it's Miharu time!

110
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:16,541
Hya!

111
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,250
Miharu watch out!

112
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,416
Um, Fukuyama,
where are you taking me?

113
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,541
Don't you worry
about that, Miharu.

114
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,250
After we find
some place secluded,

115
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,750
I'm going to take
you to paradise!

116
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,916
Miharu looks so hot
in this swimsuit,

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,625
it's almost a shame
it has to go!

118
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,041
Wait a minute,
what am I saying?!

119
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,791
Not so fast, Fukuyama!

120
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,916
Where did that
jet ski come from?

121
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,458
You're the one who
brought it to school today.

122
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,416
Dumb ass!

123
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,208
Oh, thank you for
catching me Yukinari.

124
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,041
I didn't hurt you, did I?

125
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,000
No, I'm okay.

126
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:01,541
I should've flushed you
out of the swimming pool

127
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,166
with the rest of the boys.

128
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,666
If Miharu's going to have

129
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,583
poolside naughtiness
with anyone,

130
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,041
it's going to be me!

131
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,375
No she's not!

132
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,166
Yukinari!

133
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:27,083
Yukinari... Yukinari!
Are you all right?

134
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,083
Oh, you finally woke up.
I'm so glad.

135
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,083
Mi-Miharu...

136
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,166
If something bad
ever happened to you,

137
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,208
I don't know what
I'd do, Yukinari.

138
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,458
But... but I'm not Puny-nari.

139
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:50,125
Um, Yukinari?

140
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,458
[FUKUYAMA as YUKINARI]
Don't worry Miharu, I feel fine.

141
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,000
I could stand to be taller
and less scrawny you know.

142
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,708
But hey.

143
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,791
Uh. Yukinari...

144
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,833
[FUKUYAMA as YUKINARI]
I know, let's rub sunscreen

145
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:06,083
all over each other's
willing, pliant flesh.

146
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,208
Sure.

147
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,291
[FUKUYAMA as YUKINARI]
Lisa's magic did the trick.

148
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,333
Poor Fukuyama, I think
he needs mouth-to-mouth.

149
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,000
I should be the one to do it.

150
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:18,000
Aww, no fair.

151
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,583
[YUKINARI as FUKUYAMA]
What?

152
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,833
Come on, Yoko, you gotta share.

153
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,916
All I know is I'm next.

154
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,625
[YUKINARI as FUKUYAMA]
What are they talking about?

155
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,333
I'm not Fukuyama, I'm Yukinari!

156
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,875
Oh, Fukuyama!

157
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,708
How awful!

158
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,000
He had it coming.

159
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,458
You can't get
anywhere with Miharu,

160
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,375
so you go running back
to your floozies?

161
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,291
Just give it a rest, Fukuyama.

162
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:46,583
[YUKINARI/FUKUYAMA]
Huh? It's me!

163
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:52,333
[YUKINARI as FUKUYAMA]
But then I'm... I'm... Fukuyama!

164
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,458
[YUKINARI as FUKUYAMA]
This is bad.

165
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,291
[YUKINARI as FUKUYAMA]
Huh? Kirie, listen to me.

166
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,083
I need you to
believe what I'm saying.

167
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,333
I know I look
exactly like Fukuyama,

168
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,875
[YUKINARI as FUKUYAMA] but I'm
not Fukuyama, I'm Yukinari.

169
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:10,833
I'm Yukinari! That's the
dumbest thing I've ever heard!

170
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,000
[FUKUYAMA as YUKINARI]
Hmm.

171
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:18,375
[YUKINARI AS FUKUYAMA] That
doesn't mean it's not the truth.

172
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,750
Take that!

173
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,541
Don't look, stupid!

174
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,541
[FUKUYAMA AS YUKINARI]
Hubba hubba.

175
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,625
Oh, sorry about that, Yukinari.

176
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:36,916
[FUKUYAMA AS YUKINARI]
Not a problem!

177
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,708
[YUKINARI AS FUKUYAMA]
Um, Miharu?

178
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,083
Fukuyama?

179
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,125
[YUKINARI AS FUKUYAMA]
I was wondering if maybe

180
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,791
you'd like to play
with us for a while?

181
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,750
[YUKINARI AS FUKUYAMA] Since
nobody believes I'm Yukinari,

182
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:51,166
I guess I'll just
start acting like Fukuyama.

183
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,333
[YUKINAR AS FUKUYAMA]
Gosh, I wish I were

184
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,916
even half as popular
as Fukuyama here.

185
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,458
[FUKUYAMA AS YUKINARI]
You cheater.

186
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,375
[FUKUYAMA AS YUKINARI]
You're so lucky Fukuyama,

187
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,875
but I'm allergic to women,

188
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,375
so I can't play with
the other girls like you do.

189
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,500
[FUKUYAMA AS YUKINARI]
It's so unfair.

190
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,708
Miharu's the only one
who doesn't set it off...

191
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,125
Hmm.

192
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,333
[FUKUYAMA AS YUKINARI]
Without her I'd have nothing.

193
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,583
Nothing I tell you!

194
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,125
Poor Yukinari.

195
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,375
[YUKINARI AS FUKUYAMA] Miharu,
don't you fall for it, too.

196
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,083
I'm sorry, Fukuyama.

197
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,708
Yukinari gets itchy,

198
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,208
and I'd feel bad if
he were all by himself.

199
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,666
But I'll try to make
sure Yukinari has fun today,

200
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,791
even if it's
just the two of us!

201
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,583
[YUKINARI AS FUKUYAMA]
You-you don't recognize me.

202
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:35,583
[FUKUYAMA AS YUKINARI] Well
then, better luck next time!

203
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,666
[YUKINARI AS FUKUYAMA]
But I... I don't

204
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,708
need to be around
all these other girls.

205
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,083
I'm not like Fukuyama.

206
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,375
[YUKINARI AS FUKUYAMA]
I was perfectly happy

207
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,208
just being with Miharu.

208
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,625
She's the only one I need.

209
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:53,375
[YUKINARI AS FUKUYAMA]
And now she's with him.

210
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,708
Oh, my poor dear Yukinari.

211
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,541
Don't you worry,
starting tonight,

212
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,125
we'll live together
as brother and sister.

213
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,208
I'll love you as
a sister should.

214
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,958
Well as a sister
shouldn't, I mean.

215
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:25,750
[YUKINARI AS FUKUYAMA] Miharu...
I'm happy just being with you.

216
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,958
[YUKINARI AS FUKUYAMA]
What's that doing here?

217
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,833
[FUKUYAMA AS YUKINARI] Now then,
what's next on my itinerary.

218
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,375
[FUKUYAMA AS YUKINARI]
An all-girls swimming contest!

219
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:41,583
Or perhaps a water-fight
with these luscious beauties.

220
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,375
Yukinari...

221
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,750
What's up? You haven't
been yourself this afternoon.

222
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,208
[FUKUYAMA AS YUKINARI]
Uh, whatever do you mean, Kirie?

223
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,500
I'm the same old Puny-nari
you know and love, really.

224
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:00,791
Like hell you are.

225
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,375
Miharu's a different story,

226
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,958
but how come your rashes aren't
popping up when you touch me?!

227
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,375
[FUKUYAMA as YUKINARI]
Uh...

228
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,541
Um, maybe I've finally gotten
over that pesky allergy.

229
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,083
Yeah, that's the ticket.

230
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,500
[FUKUYAMA AS YUKINARI]
Touching your body must have

231
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,208
put me on the path of healing.

232
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,458
If that's the case, you should
let me grope you more...

233
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,875
[FUKUYAMA AS YUKINARI] just
to make sure I'm totally well.

234
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,166
Are you out of your mind?!

235
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,750
Wait! You don't want
to hit me with that thing!

236
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,250
[KIRIE AS YUKINARI]
But-But that's me.

237
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:41,125
[FUKUYAMA/ AS KIRIE]
Then, I'm inside...

238
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:46,458
[FUKUYAMA AS KIRIE] This is
the greatest moment of my life!

239
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,375
[FUKUYAMA AS KIRIE]
Jackpot, baby.

240
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,500
[KIRIE AS YUKINARI] Hey! Stop
rubbing on those this instant!

241
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,875
[KIRIE AS YUKINARI]
They're not yours to play with!

242
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,583
[FUKUYAMA/KIRIE]
Oh, yeah, I definitely love

243
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,083
swim class day
the very best of all.

244
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,208
[KIRIE AS YUKINARI]
Only one person I know

245
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,041
would do this sort of thing!

246
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,166
[KIRIE/YUKINARI] This is
all your fault, Fukuyama!

247
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,500
[YUKINARI AS FUKUYAMA]
I'm not Fukuyama!

248
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,375
[KIRIE AS FUKUYAMA]
Huh? I'm Fukuyama!

249
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,166
All right! It's my body!

250
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,916
Oh, it's so good to be home
again!

251
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,791
[GIRL 1 AS YUKINARI]
No way!

252
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:32,250
[YUKINARI AS GIRL 1] Just
when I'd gotten my body back!

253
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,458
Wow! This game looks like fun!

254
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,541
Oh yeah, this is a total blast.

255
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,375
Take that!

256
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,916
[MIHARU AS YUKINARI]
I'm inside Yukinari.

257
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,625
[YUKINARI AS KIRIE]
Whoa, Miharu is inside my body?

258
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,458
[KIRIE AS FUKUYAMA]
Yukinari, you're dead meat

259
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,958
if you do anything
weird to my body!

260
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,875
[FUKUYAMA AS MIHARU]
All right! I'm in Miharu!

261
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,416
I'll never have to
leave the house again!

262
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,958
[YUKINARI AS KIRIE]
Fukuyama, I'm not gonna let you

263
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,083
fool around
with Miharu's body!

264
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:25,375
[FUKUYAMA AS MIHARU] Sorry,
Puny-nari, finders keepers.

265
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,750
This body is mine.

266
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,875
Why don't you go play
with Kirie for a while.

267
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,375
[YUKINARI AS KIRIE]
You pervert!

268
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,791
You had Lisa do all this
with her magic, didn't you?

269
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,541
[YUKINARI AS KIRIE] Have her
change us back right now!

270
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,666
[KIRIE as FUKUYAMA]
Huh? Huh?

271
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,375
That's not supposed to happen!

272
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:56,791
[KIRIE AS FUKUYAMA]
An o-o-octopus!

273
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,583
Get out of here!

274
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,541
Everyone, run for it!

275
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,958
[KIRIE AS FUKUYAMA]
Miharu! I mean... Fukuyama.

276
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,416
[YUKINARI AS KIRIE]
What's he doing?

277
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,250
[FUKUYAMA AS MIHARU] This
entire mess is Lisa's fault.

278
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,541
Only one thing to do.

279
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,583
[MIHARU AS YUKINARI]
Fukuyama!

280
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:25,416
[FUKUYAMA AS MIHARU]
Hey, come on, baby.

281
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,791
Yeah, right there.

282
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,083
[KIRIE AS FUKUYAMA]
He didn't.

283
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:46,250
[YUKINARI AS KIRIE]
B-b-but Miharu's body...

284
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,416
[FUKUYAMA AS MIHARU]
Oh, almost there!

285
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,833
[KIRIE AS FUKUYAMA]
Wait! Yukinari!

286
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,500
[YUKINARI AS KIRIE]
Let go you monster!

287
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,333
[YUKINARI AS KIRIE]
Give up already!

288
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:14,541
Between Kirie's body and
my resolve, I'm invincible!

289
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:20,416
[YUKINARI AS KIRIE]
Or maybe not!

290
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,666
[MIHARU AS YUKINARI]
Yu-Yukinari!

291
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,500
[MIHARU AS YUKINARI]
Kirie, please don't faint on me.

292
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:46,375
[KIRIE AS FUKUYAMA]
Hold on, Miharu...

293
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,916
[MIHARU AS YUKINARI]
But Kirie...

294
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,500
[KIRIE AS FUKUYAMA]
Listen, if you blow up

295
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,000
that octopus right now,

296
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,541
your real body is just gonna
get blown up along with it.

297
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:58,916
[FUKUYAMA AS MIHARU] Ooh, don't
ever stop the tentacle love.

298
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,416
[MIHARU AS YUKINARI]
I'll miss my body,

299
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,458
but if I can save Yukinari,
it's worth it.

300
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,833
[KIRIE AS FUKUYAMA]
You would... do that for him?

301
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,416
Don't! It'll take
my body with it!

302
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,916
[MIHARU AS YUKINARI]
Oh no, not Kirie's body, too!

303
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,583
I'm here!

304
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,583
[MIHARU AS YUKINARI]
Lisa?

305
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,041
[KIRIE AS FUKUYAMA]
Yeah, I should've known

306
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,416
that this was
all your fault.

307
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,958
I'm sorry. My fun
got a bit out of hand.

308
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,583
Playtime's over!

309
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,041
Miharu! Miharu!
Or are you Fukuyama?

310
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:03,875
Uh... hello Yukinari.

311
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,125
Uh, is it really you?

312
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:08,458
I'm definitely me,
Yukinari. We're okay!

313
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,875
All right!

314
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,083
You're finally
back to normal, Miharu!

315
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,750
I'm glad you're you again, too!

316
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:22,375
It's so good to be back.

317
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,541
Kirie! Are you all right?

318
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,333
Yeah, never been better.

319
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:35,708
I know I've said
it before, mother,

320
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:39,333
but Earth is
a really dreadful place.

321
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,458
[TOMO] It's a lucky thing
we came down here!

322
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:51,625
There's gotta be one good man
in a pile that big, right?

323
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,791
[TOMO] Wow, cool!

324
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,875
Big Brother?
Where did you go?

325
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,833
Big Brother!

326
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:06,375
Aww, I could've
had Yukinari all to myself

327
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,458
if you hadn't
ruined everything.

328
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,291
Yeah, thanks for all
the help, Big Brother, dear.

329
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:15,833
Big Brother! Where are
you, anyway? Big Brother!

330
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,958
[FUKUYAMA AS BOARD]
Wait! I'm over here!

331
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,708
Change me back already!

332
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,708
Lisa, change me back!

333
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,541
Oh, am I condemned to spend
the rest of my life like this?

334
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:28,208
As a section of
poolside walking planks?

335
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:32,541
To have strangers step on me
until I get moldy and rot away!

336
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,750
Somebody! Help me!

337
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,916
Kazuharu Fukuyama
is stuck in here.

338
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,291
It's terrible, huh?

339
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,916
No kidding. Seriously.

340
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,583
Let's get showered.

341
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,583
Sounds good.

342
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,791
Then again...
this could work.

343
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,291
Love, it's a prize
worth fighting for.

344
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,416
[KOSAME] Any battle waged for
love is a battle worth waging.

345
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,375
Fight for the love
you feel, Kirie!

346
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:38,625
Put your pride and your life
on the line, Kirie!

347
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,625
Do it for love!

348
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,000
What are you
talking about?

349
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:45,958
Girls Bravo Season Two,
next episode, "Fight Bravo!"

350
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,166
Hmm, I can't wait.

351
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,958
No, seriously,
what are you talking about?
