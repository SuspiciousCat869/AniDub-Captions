1
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:06,125
Correct. The target
is still here on Earth,

2
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,916
therefore the gate's
condition remains unstable.

3
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,416
Left unattended,
there's a strong likelihood

4
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,791
that the gate will
spontaneously open again.

5
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,250
Yes. Very well.

6
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:21,666
I'll continue to
watch the target.

7
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,458
[MAHARU] Aww. Koyomi and Tomoka

8
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,333
have been gone so
long and still nothing.

9
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,708
When are they gonna show up

10
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,708
with my hot
new husband to be?

11
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:54,250
The big 3-0 is
right around the corner.

12
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,000
Is this my fate?

13
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:59,583
Alone and unloved
for the rest of my life?

14
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,000
My sister is
having all sorts of fun

15
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,250
with that boy on Earth,

16
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,625
and I just sit here at home,

17
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,416
inching towards
my expiration date.

18
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,416
I'll die a lonely old maid.

19
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,541
It's Koyomi and Tomoka's fault!

20
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,083
I bet they're
too busy having fun

21
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,041
on Earth to even
think about men!

22
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,291
I am royally pissed!

23
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,708
I'll be in the damned tub!

24
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,208
Miharu! Time to go!

25
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,583
Coming!

26
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:31,000
Hey, I didn't mean
to rush you, Miharu.

27
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,875
We've got plenty of time.

28
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,916
Yeah, but... this is
my first school festival.

29
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,291
Wait a minute,

30
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,083
they don't have any
school festivals on Seiren?

31
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:45,750
Un-unh. We only
have town festivals.

32
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,416
I used to go
with my big sister.

33
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,000
She'd go too?

34
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,625
Uh-huh!

35
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,958
Big Sister Maharu loves
going out and having fun.

36
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,166
She never missed
a single festival.

37
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,916
Okay, let's go.

38
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:07,041
I wonder how
Maharu's doing.

39
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,500
Miharu!

40
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,791
I'm coming, Yukinari!

41
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:21,583
The coast is clear.

42
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,500
Tomoka, do we
really have to go?

43
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,958
We're going, okay?

44
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,708
You're such a 'fraidy cat!

45
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,375
But that school
is such a scary place.

46
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,083
There are
so many boys there...

47
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,916
and male teachers...
and Fukuyama.

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,375
I know he's
kind of perverted,

49
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,833
but Big Brother
Kazuharu is pretty nice.

50
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,458
You shouldn't say
bad things about him.

51
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,416
But we still have to find
a husband for Maharu.

52
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,875
If we don't
bring her one soon,

53
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,625
she's gonna be
really mad at us!

54
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,208
Why do today what you
can put off 'til tomorrow?

55
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,625
Um, but...

56
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,083
The two of us are going

57
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,708
to that school festival,
and that's final!

58
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,500
If you really
don't wanna go,

59
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,458
what's up with
the school uniform, huh Koyo?

60
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:03,083
Uh... n-nothing
else was clean...?

61
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,708
A likely story!

62
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:08,458
Nya! Nya nya nya nya!
Nya nya nya nya...

63
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,375
What's the matter, Ebi?

64
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,791
Nya nya nya nya...

65
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,041
I have no idea
what you're saying.

66
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:19,375
Okay Koyo, let's
head down to school.

67
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:22,291
Nyo.

68
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,208
I know they're doing it
as a personal favor,

69
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,625
but maybe I shouldn't
have asked them

70
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,000
to do it in
the first place.

71
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,750
Miharu... I wonder if
she's doing well over there.

72
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,791
Hm. I'm sure she is.

73
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,541
Oh, you know, if I could
get to Earth somehow,

74
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:51,291
I could wrap up
the husband-hunt in a snap.

75
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,916
Huh?

76
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,666
Nya Nya?

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,916

Yahhh!

W-What the hell
just happened?

80
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,416
Huh?

81
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,291
Nya nya?

82
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,750
No way.

84

Good morning.

Aren't these just
the smoothest threads

86

you've ever seen?

87

[MAHARU] It can't be.

88
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:34,708
Did I really
end up... on Earth?

89
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,750
[MAHARU laughing]

90
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,208
Okay! Let's go get me a man!

91
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,791
Welcome back, Master.
We're so glad you're home.

92
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:08,916
Okay then.

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,125
Yes, Master.
Table for one, coming up.

94
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,583
Hey you in the apron,
act more dignified.

95
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,875
Okay!

96
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,416
Keep working!
And don't forget to smile.

97
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,583
Listen up ladies,

98
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,333
even though it's only
for a few minutes,

99
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,541
every person here is
your actual master right now.

100
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,375
Make sure that
you treat them

101
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,500
with the respect
they deserve.

102
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,708
Right!

00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,708
[MACHIDA] She's so good.
Check her out, guys.

104

Thanks to Lilica
cracking the whip,

our class' maid café
is doing big business.

106
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,875
I guess.

107
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,916
Although I still
think they should've

108

voted to screen
my movie instead.

109

Guys being lazy,
that's a shock.

Uh, hi Kirie.

113

We're here to
make sure you girls

00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,083
are working hard enough.

115

Go scrub a bathroom,
clean-freak.

116
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,625
So, anyway,
wanna be a pal

117
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,208
and go shopping for me?

118
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,583
Go shopping?

the dessert bananas.

All right, we'll go
buy some more then.

Hey, where'd...
where'd they...

a little work to be done,

those two just
vanish into thin air.

Well, the shopping
arcade isn't very far.

126
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,416
I'll go by myself.

I really don't
wanna go in there.

but I'm staying here!

here all by myself, Tomoka.

like a lot of fun.

of it like that.

00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,875
Something's up.

165
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:07,041
And every time I talk
to a guy, they run off.

166
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,333
Maybe I'm just more woman
than Earth men can handle.

167
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,750
Excuse me!

168
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:18,291
Eh?

169
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,541
M-M-M-M-Maharu!

170
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,791
Ah! It's you again!

171
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,333
Miss me much?

172
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:31,583
But-But-But why are
you on Earth, Maharu?

173
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,916
[YUKINARI yells]

174
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,458
Oh! I'm so glad
I get to see you again!

175
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,708
[YUKINARI]
Must purchase bananas.

176
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,708
[MAHARU] I'm sure
you can do that later.

177
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,083
Hey, are you all
by yourself today?

178
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,583
Want some company?

179
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,375
How's Miharu been?

180
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,708
Is she doing all right?

181
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,375
I mean, I don't have
any reason to worry,

182
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,791
but that's just what
sisters do, you know?

183
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,958
Hey! Come on, you
can't just faint on me!

184
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,833
I am talking to you!

185
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,625
Hey, thanks again for
buying me this great outfit.

186
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:13,541
But... they gave me
that money to buy bananas.

187
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,458
So, this is
Miharu's high school.

188
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,416
It seems pretty cheerful.

189
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,875
It doesn't
always look like this.

190
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,458
There's a festival today.

191
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:26,916
Huh? Nice timing!

192
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,583
Man, do I love me
a good festival!

193
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,833
Huh? Isn't that...

194
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,916
Cotton candy and
octopus balls are delicious!

195
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,083
I could eat this
stuff every day!

196
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,541
Yes, but...

197
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,708
we haven't found
a husband for Maharu yet.

198
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,291
If she could
see us right now...

199
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,583
Koyo, don't be
a stick in the mud.

200
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,791
Stick in the mud?

201
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,208
Yeah, just chill out
about that promise

202
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,125
we made to
Maharu already.

203
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,166
You think I
should... chill out?

204
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,375
Think about it!

205
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,291
Maharu can't come to
Earth without permission

206
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,750
from the Space Management
Bureau back on Seiren, right?

207
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,791
And they're not gonna
let her come over here!

208
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,083
They know
better than to let

209
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:09,000
that man-crazy
goofball run amuck!

210
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,375
There's nothing wrong
with having a little fun.

211
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,333
Who's gonna know?

212
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,750
I guess you're right.

213
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,791
See, aren't
you glad you came?

214
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,750
Uh-huh! I'm gonna forget
all about Maharu today

215
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,625
and have some
fun for a change!

216
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,583
That crotchety old maid.

217
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,875
Really? So this Maharu person's

218
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,750
a crotchety
old maid, is she?

219
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:35,625
Oh yeah, we wouldn't
be here except for Maharu.

220
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,791
She asked us for
a really big favor,

221
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,125
and so we had
to come to Earth.

222
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,500
It's all her fault
we're on this planet.

223
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,958
Maybe if she
weren't so mean,

224
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,666
she'd actually find a man
who could put up with her!

225
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,083
Wow, so...
tell me something...

226
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,500
Uh-huh?

227
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,708
What's this
bitch look like?

228
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,375
Ahh!

229
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm glad we had this moment.

230
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,541
Now I know what
you think of me.

231
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,583
Run for it, Koyo!

232
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,958
Hmph. Well, well,
the plot thickens.

233
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,583
Okay, I'll see
you later then.

234
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,125
Come on!
Let's catch those brats!

235
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,458
That's what we get for having
fun all the time, Tomoka.

236
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,416
Maharu's spirit
came here to punish us.

237
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
That wasn't
Maharu's spirit, you dummy,

238
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,000
that was
the real life Maharu!

239
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,916
But what is she
doing on Earth?

240
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,375
How would Tomo know?
I'm just a little kid!

241
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:30,250
I got 'em!

242
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,458
Ah!

243
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:33,916
Koyo!

244
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,625
Did you really
think you could get away?

245
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,500
You just trashed
our booth, lady.

246
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,125
That was totally not cool!

247
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,416
How'm I supposed
to sell any of my-- 

248
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,125
Has anyone told you
you're cute when you're mad?

249
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,500
Huh? W-What
are you doing?

250
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:54,000
Mm. I just wanna see
what's underneath that apron!

251
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,083
Help me!

I swear by
the sword of my father,

255
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,000
I'll face any
foe to protect you,

256
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,208
no matter how vicious,
how monstrous,

257
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,458
how dangerous he may be.

00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,791
Ahh!

00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:19,583
Hey, hero, go fight
that red-head for me, okay?

260
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:26,583
All right! This one
looks pretty cute, too.

261
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,666
You know, I love
a man with a big sword.

262
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,083
Not to burst your bubble,

263
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,708
but that chick sitting
behind him is his girlfriend.

What? What did you say?

265
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,166
How could you string

266
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,708
a 30-year-old old
woman along like that?

267
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:43,208
So cruel. It's so cruel.

268
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,666
Ow! Ow! Ow!

269
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,708
Well, I did tell them their
futures looked pretty crappy.

270
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,750
Thanks for taking
one for the team, hero!

271
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,291
What team?

272

Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

273

How dare Kirie kick me
out of the classroom?

274
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,291
How impudent!

275
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,958
She kicked me out,
and I'm a superhero!

276
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:18,125
Huh? What's with
all the yelling?

277
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:22,458
Oh no, maybe that monster
is attacking the school again!

coming down the hall

quality-time with you...

really came all the way

from Seiren to see me again?

Cuddle me to
your endless breasts

and call me your cupcake!

Go to Hell,
you damn pervert.

threaten my classmates!

Wait, almost ready.

290
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,958
Out of my way!

291

[HALL MONITOR]
Take it outside!

292
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,125
No roughhousing
in the halls!

293
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,166
I don't understand,
how did Maharu come to Earth?

294
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,458
Don't look at me?

295
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,750
Maybe she did it
without asking the bureau.

296
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,625
Or she found
some other way.

297
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,041
Some other way?

298
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:22,291
Uh! Miharu.
I wonder if she...

299
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,750
That was...
an Aqua Lamp.

300
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,291
Huh? Koyo, no!
She'll see you!

301
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:40,041
There you are.

302
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:40,916
I expected
something like this,

303
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,041
but not nearly so soon.

304
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,000
Oh well, once
we've sealed the gate,

305
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:48,041
it won't happen again.

306
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,583
Cha-ching!

307
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,625
Our maid café
was a big hit.

308
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,708
Maybe we should do
one of these every year.

309
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,625
Um, Miharu?

310
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,208
I'm worried about Yukinari.

311
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,458
He went banana shopping
and never came back.

312
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,541
What if something
happened to him?

313
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,750
Don't worry, Miharu,

314
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,041
he's not as
helpless as he looks.

315
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,083
If you're concerned
about his well-being,

316
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,666
feel free to go
and look for him.

317
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,958
Really, it's okay?

318
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,291
Of course.
Any maid worth her salt

319
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,875
should be worried
about her master's safety.

00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,666
Yes. Thank you.

00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,291
Ah! Yukinari!

00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,583
What's going on?

324
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,250
Hey! Where are you...

325
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,250
Aww, jeez.

326
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,291
The roof!

327
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,708
No duh, Koyo!

328
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:50,875
Tomoka?

329
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,833
Come on! We can
hide under this thing.

330
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,500
Okay.

331
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,875
Tomoka?

332
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,125
Yeah?

333
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:11,666
What's gonna happen...
when Maharu catches us?

334
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,583
First she'll
beat us to a pulp,

335
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,458
and then she'll
toss us off the roof.

336
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,208
Tomo sure didn't
plan on dying young.

337
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,916
What do we do?
I'm not ready to die!

338
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Tomo is really sorry.

339
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,000
Let me live and
I promise I'll find you

340
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,333
the best damn
guy on the planet.

341
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,041
Me too!
If you forgive us,

342
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,416
I promise
I won't eat or sleep

343
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,791
or anything until
we find him for you,

344
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,333
so please don't kill us.

345
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,666
Maharu, no!

346
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,708
We're not dead?

347
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,208
I finally caught you guys.

348
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,541
Well, today
was a lot of fun.

349
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,791
And if one day on
Earth was this great,

350
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,291
I can't blame you two

351
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,458
for wanting to
have fun all the time.

352
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,166
But don't spend all
your time playing, okay?

353
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,458
Do an old maid a favor
and find her a man.

354
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:15,708
I am almost 30, you know!

355
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,666
--Right.
--On it!

356
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,250
Here Miharu.

357
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,833
Sorry, but I kind of
borrowed your boyfriend today.

358
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,500
Go easy on him for a while.

359
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,666
I love Earth.

360
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,083
Big Sister Maharu,

361
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:37,958
can't you stay
a little while longer?

362
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,083
The gate's so unstable.

363
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,416
I really should
be leaving now.

364
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,666
Don't worry about it.

365
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,041
If the gate closes,

366
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,750
I can use my Aqua Lamp
to send you back to Seiren.

367
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:51,250
Thank you, but no thanks.

368
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:54,291
There's something I have to
take care of when I get home.

369
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,750
Something you
have to take care of?

370
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,500
That's right.

371
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,666
What's Hijiri doing on Earth?

372
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,041
Something's up.

373
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,583
Maharu?

374
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,458
Oh don't mind me,
I'm just thinking out loud.

375
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,583
When you get to
be as old as I am,

376
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,916
you always end up
talking to yourself.

377
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,666
The two of them look
totally different, don't they?

378
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,916
Yeah, they really do.

379
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,666
Oh, that reminds me.

380
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,541
Your name's
Kirie, isn't it?

381
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,333
Uh, that's right.

382
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,333
Thank you for
being Miharu's friend.

383
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,333
Keep an eye on
her for me, would you?

384
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,708
It'd mean a lot to me.

385
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:31,791
Sure.

386
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,250
As for you, boy,

387
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,541
sorry about all
the trouble that I caused.

388
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:39,000
But I'm glad that
I came here today.

389
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,333
There's no way to know
what the future holds,

390
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:45,125
but I think my sister's
in good hands at your place.

391
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,083
So please keep looking
after my little sister

392
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,833
just like you have been.

393
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,500
Okay, Yukki?

394
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,375
Um, it's Yukinari.

395
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,416
Hmm? Something
bothering you, Yukki?

396
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,875
No ma'am!
I'll protect her!

397
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,916
Good! That's the spirit!

398
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,875
Well, it's time for me to go.

399
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,541
Take care, Miharu.

400
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,791
Big Sister.

401
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,416
Okay then, goodbye.

402
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:49,208
Big Sister, take care
of yourself, too.

403
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:28,333
Mmm, there's nothing
like soaking up the sun.

404
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,458
Maharu, all the redhead like
you would soak up are freckles.

405
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,250
Shut up, slacker.

406
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,083
I'm just trying to get
a spot in the next episode.

407
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,750
Don't worry, you'll
get lots of screen time

408
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,250
in the last volume.

409
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,791
I would certainly hope so!

410
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:42,458
Girls Bravo Season Two,
next episode,

411
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,250
"Sunny Afternoon is Bravo!"

412
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,250
Keep cool.

413
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,916
I wonder which
will happen first:

414
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,750
Maharu gets a husband or she'll
get a big part in the show!
