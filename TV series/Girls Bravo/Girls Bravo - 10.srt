1
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,500
We get to go to
the hot springs tomorrow!

2
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:08,791
Right on!

3
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:12,000
It was really neat how
you won the grand prize

4
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,416
in that store raffle, Miharu.

5
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,458
The supermarket people
looked really surprised!

6
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,666
I hope the bath is
big enough for all of us,

7
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,291
like they were on Seiren.

8
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,416
How can a planet
with such cool TV shows

9
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,166
have such little tubs?

10
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,541
Ready or not,
hot springs, here we come!

11
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,208
Here we are!

12
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,375
It's bath time!

13
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,916
Nya, nya nya!

14
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,791
I don't know, are you sure
we came to the right place?

15
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,583
Let me double check.

16
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,291
Three days, two nights,
at Mountain Hot Spring Inn

17
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,583
for up to five people.

18
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,083
Yeah, this is it.

19
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,541
A real popular
place this hot spring.

20
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,125
[KIRIE] Isn't this how
horror movies start?

21
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,125
The busty girls
always die first.

22
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:12,583
Pleased ta meet ya.

23
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,250
Kirie, it's just the owner.

24
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,291
Good afternoon,
it's a pleasure.

25
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,416
You must be the Sasaki party.

26
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,083
I've been expecting you.

27
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,458
Right this way, youngsters.

28
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:34,958
Okay, at least
our room doesn't look freaky.

29
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,791
The tatami mats smell good.

30
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:40,000
And the view from
our windows is gorgeous.

31
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,708
Huh? We have a TV.

32
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,166
Hey, I wonder if
Poyon's on right now.

33
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,750
Come on, it's time
for some serious soaking.

34
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,541
I can relax, since I
know that devilish pervert

35
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:54,916
isn't going to pop up.

36
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,875
I bet the bathtub here is huge!

37
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,750
Yeah!

38
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:03,500
I must admit, I don't get
many young people coming here.

39
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,416
Oh.

40
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,208
Tell me, which of those girls
are you gonna score with?

41
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,166
Huh?

42
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,541
What, are you blind?

43
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,541
They're all so sexy and bouncy!

44
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:17,833
Just pick one and move
in for the kill, sonny.

45
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,583
[KIRIE screaming]

46
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,750
Ah, Kirie!

47
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:24,166
That scream!
They must've gone out back!

48
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:29,208
What's wrong?! Are you okay?

49
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,583
Yukinari! In the hot spring...

50
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,875
There's a dinosaur.

51
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,166
Huh? A dinosaur?

52
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,000
Come on, there's no way
a dinosaur could be in her--

53
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,541
I stand corrected.

54
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,625
Giddy-yup! Go get 'em!

55
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,916
Oh, hello there, Yukinari.

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,250
M-M-M-Miharu?

57
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:03,500
They're really friendly,
especially this one.

58
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,166
The truth is,
the hot springs dried up

59
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,458
completely back around
the beginning of the year.

60
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,708
I see.

61
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,083
But... it seemed
like such a waste

62
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:15,666
to have it sit empty after
the hot springs dried up.

63
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,791
So, I did what any
bright-thinking person would...

64
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,708
I filled it with
alligators and bananas!

65
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,166
Right.

66
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,958
Uh, do you have any
tubs that are normal?

67
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:30,291
I guess I'll have to go
back to the drawing board.

68
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,583
Man, shouldn't a
hot springs hotel have,

69
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,583
oh, I dunno, a hot spring?!

70
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:40,125
Calm down, if they dried up,
there's nothing we can do.

71
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,666
And the alligators were fun!

72
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,500
Hey! it's right over there!

73
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,375
Good job, Tomoka!

74
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,708
Wow!

75
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,625
It's as beautiful
as the owner said.

76
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,833
It's a pretty nice spot, huh?

77
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:01,708
Yeah! Let's get changed,
so we can go play!

78
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,208
Let's go!

79
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:08,000
Here, Yukinari.

80
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,250
Ever worn a blindfold?

81
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,958
Huh?

82
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,666
Yeah, thanks for nothing, Kirie.

83
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,125
Hurry, hurry, come on!
It's a race!

84
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:30,291
I wish you'd stop
tugging on my bottoms, Tomoka.

85
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,333
Last one in's a rotten egg!

86
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,791
[YUKINARI whimpering]

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,583
Oh yeah?

88
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,875
Miharu, what's the matter?

89
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,333
Um, where'd Yukinari go?

90
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,041
Don't worry about
that puny pervert.

91
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm sure he's just fine.

92
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,625
Oh.

93
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,708
Thanks for not
overreacting, Kirie.

94
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,208
What do they want?

95
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,666
Who knows.

96
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,416
Hey! There's
something over here!

97
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,583
It's only a doll, right?

98
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,500
But what's it doing here?

99
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,666
And what's with those
strange marks on the chest?

100
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,416
Somebody must've
dumped it into the water.

101
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,625
Hey, Kirie! Look at what
I just found under a rock!

102
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,791
No!

103
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,041
Um, Kirie?

104
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,541
Kirie, wait for us!

105
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,625
Hey, hold on,
you guys! Come on!

106
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,958
Wait for me, okay?

107
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,250
I think we've
been going in circles.

108
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,250
Well, Kirie did freak out
and run into the woods.

109
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,500
Sorry.

110
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,666
Uh. I mean... uh...

111
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,166
Yukinari, look!

112
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,416
Eh?

113
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,958
There's a light
shining through the trees!

114
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,375
This place is huge!

115
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,208
Why's it in
the middle of nowhere?

116
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,333
Hey, how 'bout
we don't go in there?

117
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:55,541
Yeah, I have a bad
feeling about this place.

118
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,625
It was only a crow, Kirie.

119
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,666
You're okay, see?

120
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,833
Anyhow, it looks like
somebody's home right now,

121
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,125
so we should at least
ask them for directions.

122
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,208
But...what if...

123
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,875
Something smells really tasty!

124
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,750
Hey! Hold on, Miharu!

125
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:15,791
Let me go first!

126
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,250
Don't worry, silly.

127
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,541
Nobody who likes delicious
food could possibly be evil.

128
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,708
No, wait, Miharu!

129
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,625
Yukinari, is that you?

130
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:31,708
Kirie, and Miharu,
Koyomi, and Tomoka.

131
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,333
Don't poor people know
how to knock anymore?

132
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,875
It's Fukuyama!
And Lisa's here, too!

133
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,458
Why are you sitting in a creepy
house on a mountainside?

134
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:44,166
Why shouldn't we be?
We own this mountain.

135
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,875
What?!

136
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:55,875
Hey, wait a sec.

137
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,416
If you guys own the mountain,

138
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,375
is that headless mannequin
down by the river yours too?

139
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,916
Mannequin?

140
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,625
Oh! And did it happen to have
seven marks on its chest?

141
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,833
I think there were seven.

142
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,625
Ah, the memories.

143
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,791
That was the doll
I used to develop and perfect

144
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:17,541
the Fukuyama Strip Technique.
Her name was Betty.

145
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,375
Fukuyama Strip Technique?

146
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,166
She fell into
the river one day.

147
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,250
I never saw her again.

148
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,791
What about all that blood?

149
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,000
Blood?

150
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,708
I found a tree covered with it.

151
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,625
But of course,
you must be talking

152
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,125
about the strawberry jam!

153
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,166
Huh?

154
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,041
I wanted to catch some beetles,

155
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,500
so I spread jam
on a couple of trees.

156
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,416
I couldn't be
bothered to clean it up.

157
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,083
We found a skull, too.

158
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,250
Oh that?

159
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,625
Yeah, I used it for
my fortune telling.

160
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:47,250
You hit it really hard,
and then you read the cracks

161
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,833
to find out if you're
compatible with a certain guy.

162
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:53,000
Of course, it told me
that my darling Yukinari and I

163
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,250
are the perfect match!

164
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,875
Lisa, you shouldn't leave

165
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,000
your witchcraft
stuff lying around.

166
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:03,250
Well, at least I didn't have
my "special doll" wash ashore.

167
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:07,000
Oh boy.
I'm suddenly really tired.

168
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,458
Tired? Hey, I know!

169
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,833
Why don't you take a relaxing
soak in our hot spring?

170
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,291
Oh, so there's
a hot spring here, too?

171
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,333
Indeed! Before we bought it,

172
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,375
this lodge was
a hot springs hotel.

173
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,083
There's even a large
outdoor bath, Miharu,

174
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,375
if you're interested.

175
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,333
Yeah! I can finally
bathe in a big tub again!

176
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:29,666
I thought--

177
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,541
Lisa! I think our
hot spring speaks for itself.

178
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,000
What are you talking about?

179
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,291
You dummy. Do I have
to draw you a picture?

180
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:42,000
Hot springs for me.
Puny-nari for you.

181
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,291
Oh. I see.

182
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,875
You're so smart.

183
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,041
Hey! What are you two
whispering about over there?

184
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,250
She was just telling me

185
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,000
how glad she is that
I'm her brother, Kirie.

186
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,958
Kirie dear,
would you like seconds?

187
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,333
No thanks.

188
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,875
Well then, now that
everyone's finished eating,

189
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,166
how about a nice relaxing bath?

190
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,083
But... what if... I mean...

191
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,458
No kidding.

192
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,875
I think Fukuyama's hot spring
sounds pretty fishy.

193
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,583
You probably wired
it to scan my boobs,

194
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,000
didn't you, you sicko?

195
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,500
Why do you hate me?

196
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,916
Fine then!

197
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,541
You said that you were tired,

198
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,708
so I innocently
offered you my hot spring.

199
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,833
I was only trying to be nice.

200
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,708
You poor thing.

201
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,291
Okay, I get it.

202
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,500
Fine. We'll try the
damned thing, but no peeking!

203
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:30,375
If you do,
I swear I'll kill you.

204
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,125
Splendid!
You can trust me, Kirie!

205
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,916
Great! And Yukinari you
can finish your dinner here

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,250
while you wait
for them to come back.

207
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,041
Huh? I don't get to
go to the hot spring?

208
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,375
Don't be stupid!

209
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,250
It belongs to me,
so I decide who gets to use it!

210
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,250
The only people allowed in

211
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,791
are beautiful girls
and my own self,

212
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,875
and you, thankfully enough,
are neither of those things.

213
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,541
Thanks. I got it.

214
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,041
Watch our stuff for us,
okay Yukinari?

215
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:58,833
Come on Miharu...
Koyomi... let's get goin'.

216
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,791
Yukinari... you're not going
to come to the hot springs?

217
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,041
Hey, go have fun.
I'll be okay.

218
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,000
Tomoka, are you staying here?

219
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,208
I guess so. Let's go ladies!

220
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,583
You look thirsty.
Here, drink up.

221
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,083
Oh, thank you.

222
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,666
Oh. Boy. What's going on?

223
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,666
Yeah! That's why
I love this show!

224
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,583
Lights! Camera! Action!

225
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:52,875
No! Get out of there!

226
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,041
The whole thing
is a giant trap!

227
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,000
Now... Yukinari.

228
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,833
Damn I'm good.

229
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,708
Run! Before it's too late!

230
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,791
The party's
just getting started.

231
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,333
You're not going anywhere.

232
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,875
Oh no, you're trapped!

233
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,416
No, don't touch that!

234
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,625
If it goes off,
it could kill us all!

235
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,083
It's finally
mine for the taking!

236
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,208
Come on, just a
little bit further.

237
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,583
All right, you're so close.

238
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,833
That's it! Yeah!

239
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:28,833
Just like that!

240
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,541
One more inch
and you're there!

241
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,291
What is it?

242
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,708
Damn!

243
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:42,291
I should've known it would
come before I had any fun.

244
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,583
What's going on?

245
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,041
No time to explain.
Follow me.

246
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,583
Yukinari!

247
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,541
Kirie?

248
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,666
It was awful.
It appeared out of nowhere!

249
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,041
Uh, Kirie, what are
you talking about?

250
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,375
There's a ghost!

251
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:05,916
Does the word "ghost"
mean anything to you?

252
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,875
Go do your peeping in Hell!

253
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,416
Sneaking a peek,
you pervert!

254
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,791
Why me?

255
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,291
Pervert?

256
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,250
A pervert?

257
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,208
Wah!

258
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,041
You again.

259
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,250
How dare you frighten
my luscious young guests?

260
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,666
I'm going to have
to teach you a lesson...

261
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,708
A very kinky lesson.

262
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,833
No! Stay back!

263
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,166
Don't come any closer, please!
I'm begging you!

264
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,875
Uh, Kirie.

265
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,458
I can't stand it.

266
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,125
Stand what?

267
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,458
Ghosts you little dumbass!

268
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,416
I'm really scared
of ghosts and demons

269
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,458
and all of that
supernatural crap!

270
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,208
I'm so happy!

271
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,416
I finally get to meet you.

272
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,916
Stop putting the moves
on my soul mate!

273
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,583
Be gone, evil spirit!

274
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,541
Hold on, Lisa.

275
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,500
You finally get to meet me?

276
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,041
Do you know who I am?

277
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,916
No. I've never
seen you before.

278
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,958
But she called
you a pervert.

279
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,916
And I've been
waiting so long for one!

280
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,333
Huh?

281
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,750
Why don't you tell us
what this is all about?

282
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,541
Yes. It happened last winter.

283
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,291
I came down here
alone one evening

284
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,291
to relax in the hot spring.

285
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,958
And that's when I heard it.

286
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,208
Is-Is someone out there?

287
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:58,375
No! That dirty
pervert ran his hands

288
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,416
all over my innocent flesh!

289
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,250
And--And then?

290
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,625
What happened next?

291
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,000
I got mad.

292
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,875
I wanted that pervert
to pay for what he had done.

293
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,541
So when he
started to run away,

294
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,500
I tried to catch him.

295
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,791
But then I slipped
on the wet rock.

296
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:23,083
I hit my head
when I fell... and died.

297
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,875
Oh, that's so sad!

298
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:28,791
And so, you've been haunting
this hot spring ever since then?

299
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,458
Yes.

300
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,041
I get it.
So you're the reason

301
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,791
that our hot spring
suddenly stopped working.

302
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,583
What? This hot spring
doesn't work either?

303
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,333
Sorry about that.

304
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,583
When I see people having
fun at the hot springs,

305
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:45,041
I get really lonely,
and it just happens.

306
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,791
But not now.

307
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,416
I'd like to move on
to the next world,

308
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
but I haven't been able to.

309
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,791
So I've been patiently
waiting for a pervert.

310
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,916
What? But I'm not!

311
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,250
I did curse
the original pervert,

312
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,583
so I guess I should feel like
I've already had my revenge.

313
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,041
Revenge, huh?

314
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,500
But I really
wanted to catch him...

315
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,125
run after him with real legs

316
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,500
and grab him
with real hands.

317
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,958
My regret is
what keeps me here.

318
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,291
I thought maybe if
I found another pervert,

319
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,333
I could deal with that regret

320
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,000
and figure out
a way to move on.

321
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,500
Interesting.

322
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,208
Since you were unable
to capture the pervert,

323
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,333
you've been unable
to rest in peace.

324
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,166
Uh-huh.

325
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,625
I know!
We should do a reenactment.

326
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,625
What?

327
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,708
We'll have
Yukinari feel you up,

328
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,000
and you can catch him!

329
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,708
Hey! Hold on a minute, Lisa!

330
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,208
That's a very good idea!

331
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,750
No it's not!

332
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:42,541
But you'll need to inhabit a
living person to make this work.

333
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,500
I volunteer my body
for the reenacted groping.

334
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,916
Do you really mean it?

335
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,083
Yeah! I can't wait!

336
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,416
Oh, Yukinari!

337
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,833
Don't touch me there.

338
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,666
Oh no, the pervert's
grabbing me all over,

339
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,791
whatever will I do?

340
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,208
But I don't want to!

341
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,250
Now! Just make yourself
at home! Go for it!

342
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,291
Yes! This really
means a lot to me!

343
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,625
Oh my, Kirie, you're so warm.

344
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,833
No!

345
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:24,625
Are you... okay?

346
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:28,291
I feel a little dizzy,
but I think I'll be all right.

347
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,583
This is the first time
that I've done this.

348
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,583
This is so unfair.

349
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,791
I can summon demons
at the drop of a hat,

350
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,750
but I can't host
one measly spirit?

351
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,333
This is no laughing matter,
dear Yukinari!

352
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,208
I was really
looking forward to you

353
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,000
doing all sorts of
unmentionable things to me.

354
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,333
Is it okay?

355
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,583
Uh...

356
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,000
Here we go.

357
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:54,666
Wait! What the hell do
you think you're doing?!

358
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,500
I see, Kirie, you like him.

359
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,000
Is she all right in there?

360
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,125
No! No! No!

361
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,125
Yes, she's doing just fine.

362
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,250
Okay.

363
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,833
Well then, if you're ready.

364
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,291
Huh? But I...

365
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,250
Just think like a
pervert and fondle me.

366
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,875
It's not that easy!

367
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,333
I knew Puny-nari wasn't
man enough for the task!

368
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:22,125
Allow me to demonstrate
the basics for you!

369
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:29,041
Don't worry,
those are happy tears!

370
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,500
All right.

371
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,375
No! This isn't happening!

372
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,583
Bravo, Puny-nari!

373
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,750
We'll make a man of you yet!

374
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,125
W-w-w-wait wait.

375
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,458
Stop it already.

376
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,458
It'll be okay, I know it.

377
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,458
Huh?

378
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:53,750
Just be yourself.

379
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:58,208
Oh. All right.

380
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:13,500
I've never felt...
anything like this before.

381
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:21,250
It feels so good.
I'm so close, almost there.

382
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,833
Thank you all so much.

383
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:33,958
Bye Miss Ghost!
Have a great time in Heaven!

384
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:38,041
Health and long life
to you all! Thank you.

385
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:43,208
Oh, and Kirie.
What a wonderful person.

386
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,500
Wait, what are you saying?

387
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,416
I'll see you around!

388
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,291
Until then...

389
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,666
He is wonderful, isn't he?
