1
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,666
Ah! This is...

2
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,333
A girl?

3
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:21,500
Yeah. We looked in the tub,
and there she was... out cold.

4
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,666
She was...
in my bathtub?

5
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,458
[YUKINARI and KOYOMI]
Ahh!

6
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,375
Hey, wait, what did I do?

7
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,500
What?

8
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,250
It's a man!

9
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,000
It's amnesia,
there's no question.

10
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:40,250
The Earth... it's so close
and yet so far...

11
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,875
my father's planet.

12
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:47,916
Are you saying...
you're from--

13
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,791
The star mark.

14
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,833
I remember...

15
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,875
What I'm
supposed to do.

16
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,166
I'm supposed to...

17
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:12,583
[MIHARU] Koyomi! Go on,
I brought you a towel.

18
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,375
Oh, uh, well thank you
for doing that.

19
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,416
[MIHARU giggles]

20
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,916
Seiren...

21
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:46,416
[MAHARU] Listen up! How many
times do I have to explain?!

22
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,625
My younger sister
disappeared from our bathroom.

23
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,958
[CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENT]
So you keep telling us.

24
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,083
Could you please try
to calm down a little?

25
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,791
[MAHARU] My sister
vanished into thin air!

26
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,541
I'm not feeling very serene!

27
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,666
Anyhow, she--she's been
assigned a case number.

28
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,625
There's no point
waiting around.

29
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,291
Whatever! Just hurry up
and find her already!

30
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,750
We'll do our best!

31
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,375
But it still might
take a little time.

32
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:13,583
Miharu... here I am
worried sick about her,

33
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,625
and she's probably having
all sorts of fun with that guy!

34
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,375
They're probably getting it
on morning, noon, and night!

35
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:25,375
So unfair! I'm not gonna
let her have all the fun!

36
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,625
A missing person case?

37
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,125
The subject is
Miharu Sena Kanaka.

38
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,291
She disappeared from her
bathroom about a month ago now.

39
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,208
We have reason to
think she's on Earth.

40
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,875
I want you to bring
her back to Seiren...

41
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,958
before the Special Forces
ladies start butting in.

42
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,416
Can I count on you, Koyomi?

43
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,208
Yes.

44
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:49,000
The crystalized Aqua Lamp
will only give you

45
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,375
a 36-hour window
of opportunity

46
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,916
in which to
complete your mission.

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,791
If you exceed
that 36-hour limit,

48
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:58,041
you won't be able
to return to Seiren.

49
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,875
Do you understand?

50
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,625
Perfectly, Captain.

51
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,708
I do hope that your first
assignment goes smoothly.

52
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,625
[KOYOMI] Right!

53
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,541
[FROG] Rise and shine!

54
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:14,208
It's time to eat breakfast.
Rise and shine!

55
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,500
Only 12 hours...

56
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,458
Hello?

57
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,291
[KIRIE] Yukinari!

58
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,083
How come you act
like such a damn pervert

59
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,666
every single morning!

60
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,875
[MIHARU] Excuse me, but did
I do something I shouldn't have?

61
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,875
Listen to me, please!
You've got it all wrong!

62
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,333
[KOYOMI] Excuse me...
[KIRIE] I've got it all wrong?

63
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,416
Fine!

64
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,208
Why the hell is
Miharu wearing that?

65
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,791
[YUKINARI] Well...
[KIRIE] Why?

66
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,041
I--

67
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:44,875
[KIRIE] You what?
[YUKINARI] ...don't know.

68
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:45,958
Hello?

69
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,375
What do you mean
you don't know?

70
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,708
Excuse me?

71
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:49,666
If you made Miharu wear that,
you are dead meat!

72
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,791
Hold on a minute!

73
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,375
[MIHARU] But he didn't, Kirie.

74
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:57,250
I wanted to learn more about
doing things the Earth way. See?

75
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,750
Ah!

76
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:02,166
I found this magazine in a box
underneath Yukinari's bed.

77
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,583
There are a bunch of pictures
of women who are cooking,

78
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,208
but they're not wearing
anything but an apron and socks.

79
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,541
I just assumed that's how

80
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,416
you're supposed
to cook on Earth.

81
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,916
[YUKINARI] Not quite, Miharu.

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,583
Uh, gimme that magazine.

83
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:17,625
[KIRIE speaking angrily]
Yukinari!

84
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,000
[YUKINARI laughs uncomfortably]

85
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,541
I'm not allergic to
photographs of girls, you know.

86
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,958
You porn-reading pervert!

87
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:30,166
Nasty! Nasty! Nasty! Nasty!
Nasty! Nasty! Nasty! Nasty!

88
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,291
I thought you were afraid
of girls, you sleazy bastard!

89
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,000
What should I do?

90
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,125
First the shock of traveling
here gives me amnesia...

91
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,458
then I discover
that one of the people

92
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,958
who took care of me
was the very girl I was

93
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:49,000
sent here to locate
and bring back to Seiren.

94
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:54,125
I really wanted to do a good
job on my first assignment.

95
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:58,666
What should I do?
There's only half a day left!

96
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,208
Koyomi?

97
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,333
Uh, yes?

98
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,250
Miharu made a couple
of rice balls for you,

99
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,666
if you're hungry, uh...

100
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,333
Let's see... where...

101
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,875
Uh, thank you.

102
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,750
I'll leave them
over here.

103
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,541
Do you...
remember yet?

104
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:20,750
Oh... sorry.

105
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,500
I see.

106
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,666
Koyomi?

107
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,083
Uh, yeah?

108
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:29,375
I got a hunch that...
you came here from Seiren, huh?

109
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,125
What?

110
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:34,166
You were saying yesterday
that your father is from Earth.

111
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,250
Oh... right.

112
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,375
I guess that your
memory came back.

113
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,541
Mhmm.

114
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,875
I'm glad.

115
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,833
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to lie.

116
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,708
Hey, don't
worry about it.

117
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,791
Well, then, I...

118
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,416
You're here because
of Miharu, aren't you?

119
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,291
Yes. My name is
Koyomi Hare Nanaka.

120
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,875
Miharu's older sister
put in a request

121
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:06,416
with the Space Management
Bureau, and... they sent me.

122
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,083
You came to take Miharu back.

123
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,750
Yeah.

124
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,375
This is all of it, right?

125
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,750
This is definitely
most of it!

126
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,625
I know Koyomi's eating with us,

127
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,500
but isn't this still
gonna be too much food?

128
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,708
But... I wanna make
sure that Yukinari

129
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,375
can eat as much
as he wants today.

130
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,791
As much as he wants?

131
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,125
[KOYOMI] The wormhole that
connects Seiren and Earth

132
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,625
will close in
another half a day.

133
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,416
We have to go back
before that happens.

134
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,583
[YUKINARI] Miharu doesn't
know any of this yet, does she?

135
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:43,541
No.

136
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,208
I see.

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,416
Uh, Yukinari?

138
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,583
Yeah?

139
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,250
I thought that you were...

140
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:55,166
they told me that you
were allergic to women,

141
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,833
but you seem
fine around Miharu.

142
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:02,333
I'm better than fine.
I can't really explain it.

143
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,875
I randomly popped into
Miharu's bathroom on Seiren.

144
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,791
When she accidentally
came to Earth,

145
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,250
I let her stay here,
'cause she had nowhere to go.

146
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,125
Pure coincidence...

147
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,958
But now... I think
that it was meant to be!

148
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,083
[CHILD KOYOMI]
Hey Mommy?

149
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,291
[MOM] Hmm?

150
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,000
Where did Daddy go?

151
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,916
To a faraway place.

152
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,083
A faraway place?

153
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,916
Father went back to his home.

154
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,166
Uh?

155
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,208
He went up there.
Back to his home on Earth.

156
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,833
Do you understand?

157
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,875
But... he'll
come back, right?

158
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,458
[KOYOMI] To reunite people
with their loved ones...

159
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,041
that's the whole
reason I took this job.

160
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,333
I know it's my
assignment, but...

161
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,791
I don't think
I have the right

162
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:58,958
to separate two people who
care so much for each other.

163
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,041
I'll go alone.

164

[YUKINARI knocking]
Koyomi?

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,416
Uh? Yukinari!

166
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,166
I, uh... I'm going back
to Seiren by myself.

167
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,166
I'll just tell my superiors

168
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,000
that I couldn't
find Miharu in time.

169
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:21,416
Miharu! I-I just...

170
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,583
Koyomi, I know
you came here

171
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,333
all the way from
Seiren to find me.

172
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,000
You knew it all along?

173
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,666
Mmm.

174
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,083
It's okay,
I can tell Maharu

175
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,708
that you're safe
and sound here on Earth.

176
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,208
That way you can stay--

177
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,125
No.

178
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:41,208
Yukinari and I had
a long talk about it.

179
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,416
I think I should
go back to Seiren.

180
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,541
But if... if
you do that,

181
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,208
Yukinari and you won't
be together anymore.

182
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:53,791
I really like Earth,
but Seiren is my home.

183
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,708
Miharu...

184
00:11:58,833 --> 00:11:59,958
Don't worry.

185
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,833
I know Yukinari and I
will both be all right.

186
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:07,416
So come on. It's time
we were going home.

187
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:14,041
Yeah... Yeah.

[MAHARU crying] Miharu!

192
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,833
Hi Maharu.

193
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:10,083
Miharu, I was so
worried about you!

194
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,833
Excellent work, Koyomi.

195
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:19,375
But Chief, I...
I didn't really do much.

196
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:23,083
Mission accomplished.
Congratulations.

197
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,541
[MAHARU] I'm so glad.

198
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,583
I'm so glad you're home.

199
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,750
I'm going!

200
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,083
Yukinari?

201
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,416
Good morning.

202
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,750
Good morning!
You're early for a change.

203
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,583
It wasn't so tough.

204
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,791
Uh, so, uh where's Miharu?

205
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,333
She went home.

206
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,625
Huh?

207
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:13,541
To Seiren.

208
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:14,583
What? Hold on!

209
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,416
Wait, Yukinari,
what are you saying?

210
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,125
They're both gone?!

211
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,708
Koyomi came to take
Miharu back to Seiren,

212
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,500
and you just stood there
and let the two of them leave?

213
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,833
Hey, leave him
alone, Fukuyama!

214
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,125
They'd still be here

215
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,125
if you weren't such
an asexual waste of space.

216
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,375
Now they're gone forever,
and it's your fault!

217
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,666
Stop it, Fukuyama!

218
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,916
It's all your fault!

219
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,625
Cut it out!
Cut it out already!

my back is breaking.

221

But the warmth
of Kirie's firm, taut buttocks

222
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,166
against mine leaves

in Hell!

you know.

It's my fault
that she left.

through a lot lately,

it easy for a while, okay?

in the excitement
of the moment, but...

244

thank you for
finding my sister.

I mean, I was
only doing my job,

and Miharu helped me
out so much on Earth,

I should probably
be thanking her.

Yeah?
She did, huh?

Um, is Miharu
home right now?

out with the dishes.

on Earth, isn't it?

Sorry about the mess,
Big Sister Maharu.

260
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,666
As soon as I've cleaned up,

261
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,250
I'll get everything
ready for dinner.

262

Say, can Koyomi stay
and eat dinner with us?

You're such a sweet girl.

267
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,458
From the moment that
our father passed away,

268
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:41,041
you've never asked me
for a single thing.

269
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,958
Except for seconds, right?

270
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:47,166
I'm really happy
to have you back,

271
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,541
and Koyomi, I'll never
forget what you did.

272
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,791
But it's not up to me.

273
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,791
For once in your life,

274
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,000
you should think of
your own happiness.

275
00:17:56,083 --> 00:18:00,291
Be selfish.
Do whatever you want to do.

So, what do you want
more than anything?

To be with Yukinari.

Then that's
what you should do.

280
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,208
I wonder if all of
the men on that planet

281
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,875
are as great as
the one that she found.

282
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:31,375
Maybe I should wish on
a star for my future husband.

283
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:37,333
And for my little sister.
I know she'll be happy.

284
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,083
We've received a communique
from the Information Division.

285

It seems that girl has used
the gate to return to Earth.

286

[KOYOMI]
What's its status?

287
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,250
It's stabilized for
the moment. The Aqua Lamp

288
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,041
should function
without any problems.

289
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:56,833
It's a Special Forces
matter now.

290
00:18:56,916 --> 00:19:01,166
I didn't know...
I'm very sorry.

291
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,583
Don't worry.

292
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,375
So far nobody has
filed a search request.

293
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,375
And truth be known,
I'm not too fond

294
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,250
of those
Special Forces ladies.

But Chief Nanae!

296
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,875
And Koyomi...
I have another job for you.

297
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,375
Hey, Yukinari,
do you wanna swing by

298
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,916
the shopping
arcade for a bit?

299
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,500
Huh?

300
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,458
There's a new cake shop
opening up down there,

301
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,500
and they say it's
supposed to be pretty good.

302
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,875
No thank you.

303
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:33,750
I think I just
wanna be alone today.

304
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,208
I know.

305
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,583

309
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,000

311
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,125
Ah?

But... Miharu...
I thought you...

Big Sister Maharu
said that I could go.

316
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,541
So I thought
about you really hard

317
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,875
until that special blue light
started shining around me.

318
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:11,750
And suddenly, there I was...
sitting in your bathtub.

319
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:18,416
I guess... I came back.

320
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,333
Oh, Kirie!

321
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,666

back to Earth, too!

322

Looks like things around
here are gonna be lively again.

323
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:41,583
Oh, there is something...
that I should mention.

324
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,708
[TOMO] Hello!

325
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:48,541
Missing people?
Stolen items? General worries?

326
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,083
Have no fear,
now that Tomoka's here!
