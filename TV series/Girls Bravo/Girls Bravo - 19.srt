[glass shattering]

2
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,958
[alarm ringing]

3
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,250
Dammit!

4
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,500
Sir!

5
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,041
[MACHIDA] My daughter
and I are all right,

6
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,291
but they made off

7
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,458
w-w-with our family's
most treasured heirloom,

8
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,458
the Mamo-ranger mask!

9
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,833
Rabbit monsters!
The rabbit monsters took it!

10
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,833
Damn! The Phantom Rabbits!
I should have known.

11
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,875
They're not
getting away this time!

12
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:16,333
[police whistles blowing]

13
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:17,333
Stop!

14
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,333
He's really persistent.

15
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,666
Here, catch Kirie!

16
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,750
Hey, nice pass, Miharu.

17
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,416
Go ahead and call me a tortoise,

18
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,375
I'm coming out
of my shell today.

19
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,250
Look out evil-doers!

20
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:34,875
Maybe not.

21
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,791
What a shame.

22
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,541
Some guys don't
know when to quit.

23
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,291
You shouldn't even try to
catch the Phantom Rabbits.

24
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,166
Here.

25
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:51,250
Don't underestimate me,
you thieving hussies!

26
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,458
Gotcha!

27
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,791
I finally captured
the Phantom Rabbits.

28
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,208
Piece o' cake!

29
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,750
Huh? What the--?

30
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,333
Blow-up dolls?

31
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,625
Get back here!

32
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,583
Hey...

33
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,083
Not their intended use,
but oh well.

34
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,958
Funny. I feel like
I know them from somewhere.

35
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,625
Nya nya nya. Nya nya. Arf!

36
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,750
You know we cut it
really close last night.

37
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,250
I'm really sorry.

38
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,250
I know I never should
have been so careless.

39
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,583
That's true.

40
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,333
They almost
captured us, Kirie.

41
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,958
Still, I'm glad you
weren't injured worse.

42
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,083
I guess it's a good thing

43
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,583
he's not a better shot, huh?

44
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,625
Well! I think he
meant to only wing me.

45
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:57,166
I happen to know that
Kazuharu's a very skilled shot.

46
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,625
You'd think
Kazuharu was perfect

47
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,625
the way you always
stick up for him.

48
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,041
No I don't!

49
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:06,166
Big Sister Kirie goes for
the strong, violent type.

50
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,625
No I don't!

51
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,041
I like him too.

52
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,125
After all, he has
been one of our café's

53
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,833
most loyal customers.

54
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:16,375
Customer...

55
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,750
Oh.

56
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,125
Hey! Don't get sloppy now.

57
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,833
You know he
must never find out

58
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,791
that we are
the Phantom Rabbits

59
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,500
who give him
so much trouble.

60
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,625
Don't you worry, Koyomi.

61
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,791
I promise not to
tell him our secret.

62
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,291
And I'm going to
get our loot back

63
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,291
if it's the
last thing I do.

64
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:40,833
Ugh. Great,
I got the joker.

65
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,666
Listen up you guys!

66
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,666
Oh my gosh, Tomoka.

67
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,833
Are you
trying to scare us

68
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,583
all half to
death or something?

69
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,333
Don't sneak up
on us like that!

70
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,666
I wanna come
along next time!

71
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,000
Tomoka, you're
still not old enough yet.

72
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,208
She's right.

73
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,000
That's why
we always say no.

74
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,250
What kind of
reason is that?

75
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,500
Why can't I go?

76
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,500
I could help out
with all kinds of stuff.

77
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,833
It's not fun
and games, Tomoka.

78
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:06,833
Huh?

79
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,833
Failure is not an option.

80
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,375
The stakes are too high.

81
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,208
We leave with the loot
no matter what risk.

82
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:17,375
And that's the cardinal
rule of the Phantom Rabbits.

83
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,125
Tomoka?

84
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,416
Nya! Nya!

85
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,750
Somebody get
him off of me!

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,875
These tailor-made pants
cost me a small fortune.

87
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,208
But Fukuyama, Ebi loves
you more than anyone.

88
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,875
Sure Miharu, just go ahead
and kick me while I'm down.

89
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,375
Hey, I've got an idea,

90
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,875
you should ask
your superiors

91
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,875
to hire Ebi
as a police dog.

92
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,041
Oh, don't you start in.

93
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,208
Here, your favorite.

94
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,083
Oh, why thank you.

95
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,625
Huh?

96
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,041
So, uh, how
about them Rabbits?

97
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,166
Huh?

98
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,541
Oh yeah, I almost
captured them again,

99
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,000
for whatever
that's worth.

100
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,958
I read about it
in the newspaper.

101
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,416
You know, at least
they didn't get away

102
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
with that mask
they were after.

103
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,750
Yeah.

104
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,250
But only
because one of them

105
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,416
dropped it into the river

106
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,750
as they were
making their escape.

107
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:15,958
And there was
another incident

108
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,500
at the same
time last night.

109
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,916
Huh? Another incident?

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,500
Can you ladies
keep a secret?

111
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,500
Yeah. Yeah.

112
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,416
They left behind
a ransom note!

113
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,916
You were chasing the Rabbits.

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,291
I was in the bathroom,

115
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,750
and when I came out,
my daughter was gone.

116
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,083
The only clues I found

117
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:38,041
were her panties
and that note!

118
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,250
Oh no!

119
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,250
"I have your daughter.

120
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,500
If you want her back,

121
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:43,916
I'll trade her for the
gold Mamo-ranger mask.

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,958
--The Phantom Thief BS."
Ah, The Phantom Thief,

123
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,958
a dastardly new villain
here in Water Field Town.

124
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,958
Otherwise known
as Black Snow.

125
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,666
But... that's
the worst kind!

126
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,708
Rumor has it he's collecting

127
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,125
rare and valuable masks
from all over the world.

128
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:03,333
First the Rabbits,
and now this Black Snow?

129
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,083
Oh, Lisa!

130
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:13,208
So then, how are you going
to track him down, Fukuyama?

131
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:17,958
Easy. Scotland Yard
is nothing if not thorough.

132
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,125
Our investigation has yielded
a very likely suspect.

133
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,708
Really? Who do
you think it is?

134
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,666
Loose lips sink ships,
as they say.

135
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,000
This CD contains

136
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:32,750
all of the information
on our suspect.

137
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,166
Just be careful.

138
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,833
You'd be in
a bit of a pickle

139
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,000
if anything
should happen to it.

140
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,416
Thank you, Kirie.

141
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
But he's already
as good as caught.

142
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,833
We'll storm
into his hideout

143
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,291
just as soon as
everything's in place.

144
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,208
Tell me, Kirie...

145
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,333
Uh?

146
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,333
What's wrong
with your hand?

147
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,500
Oh no, it's nothing.

148
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:02,708
So, uh, Fukuyama.

149
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,833
Um, I bought
some new lipstick.

150
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,875
Well, what do you think?

151
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,416
Uh, it's rather sexy.

152
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,791
D-D-Don't work too
hard on this case.

153
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,583
All work and no play...

154
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,250
Okay.

155
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,583
You pulled it off!

156
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:34,083
Koyomi, that
was really amazing!

157
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,208
What is this place?

158
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,375
Please, somebody help me!

159
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,166
Is anybody there?

160
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,583
That must be her...
the poor little thing.

161
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,458
Come on, let's get her
out of here right away.

162
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,750
If Mr. Machida buys

163
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,750
his daughter back
with the gold mask,

164
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,625
and Black Snow
gets his hands on it...

165
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,125
Then the Phantom Rabbits
would be disgraced!

166
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,416
Yeah we would!
Let's stop 'em!

167
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,125
I'll make sure we
get that mask back

168
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,750
if it's the
last thing I do.

169
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:18,000
Daddy, help!

170
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,666
Who are all of you?

171
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:30,583
A trap?

172
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,458
Please, just
let us out of here!

173
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,875
Come on, I'll make
it worth your while,

174
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,791
if you know
what I mean.

175
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:56,791
It'll be okay,

176
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,291
we're gonna
get you out of here.

177
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,000
I expected those bumbling
fools from Scotland Yard,

178
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,000
but you three
were a surprise.

179
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,291
Amazing what good
bait will attract.

180
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,000
Hey, you don't play fair.

181
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,791
Trading the loot
for a hostage

182
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,125
isn't a very
sporting way

183
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,791
to go about
stealing things.

184
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:15,708
When it comes to me
getting the masks I desire,

185
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,500
the ends
justify the means.

186
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,208
So what are you
going to do with us?

187
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,000
I've come to the conclusion
that Water Field Town

188
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,500
isn't big enough
for the four of us.

189
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,041
I do appreciate my rivals
delivering themselves

190
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,875
into my clutches like this.

191
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,500
They're not
technically masks,

192
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,083
but your rabbit ears
are pretty cute.

193
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,750
Perhaps I should add
them to my collection, eh?

194
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,958
Why don't you add this
to your collection?!

195
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,833
Ow! Damn you
Phantom Rabbits!

196
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:44,958
Mark my words,

197
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,666
I'm gonna make you
pay for that later!

198
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,041
I'd like to see you try it.

199
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,666
Don't worry,
we'll get you out, Lisa.

200
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,041
Just trust us.

201
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,791
Why should I
trust you thieves?

202
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,416
You're thieves aren't you?

203
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,208
Then there isn't
any difference, huh?

204
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,958
You're no better
than Black Snow is.

205
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,291
We're way better.

206
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,125
The only thing
we have in common

207
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,458
with that hooded freak

208
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,375
is that we all really want
your father's gold mask.

209
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,541
That's right!

210
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:11,708
We did risk our lives

211
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,625
to sneak in here
and rescue you, you know.

212
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:14,875
Where do you get off

213
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,375
saying that we're
no better than Black Snow?

214
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,791
Quiet!

215
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:22,375
Now let's get outta here.

216
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,125
All right!

217
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,166
Hey, you really
can trust us.

218
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,958
Oh, you'd think
a place this big

219
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,250
would have exit signs!

220
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,500
Keep your eyes
peeled for traps.

221
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,750
Well, they're a risk
we're gonna have to face.

222
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,125
There's something I don't get.

223
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,583
Huh?

224
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,583
How did you
know where I was?

225
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,291
Well, it's because...

226
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,291
It's because somebody
has a really big mouth.

227
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,958
Somebody has
a really big mouth?

228
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,625
Yeah, and it's
Scotland Yard's

229
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,833
most famous and
successful detective!

230
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,791
He's really just
a big blabbermouth.

231
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,916
Kazuharu's not a blabbermouth.

232
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,416
Koyomi managed
to steal that disc

233
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,416
with the information
about Black Snow right out

234
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,125
from underneath
Kazuharu's nose.

235
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,916
Thank you
for telling me.

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,833
All right, enough
with the chit chat, girls.

237
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,083
Black Snow
might have noticed

238
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,000
we broke out
of our cell.

239
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,333
Let's hurry.

240
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,291
Okay, you can
come out now!

241
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,708
Could you be any louder?

242
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,666
Why is there
sticky stuff on the floor?

243
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,833
It's too sticky!

244
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,125
I can't... pull
myself out of it.

245
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,833
Now we're in trouble.

246
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,500
Thank you for
bringing her back.

247
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,125
We weren't trying
to bring her back,

248
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,458
we were trying to leave.

249
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,458
Hey, Lisa,
are you all right?

250
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,041
Uh-huh,
I'm fine, Kirie!

251
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:00,041
But what about where that
bullet grazed your hand?

252
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:04,250
Huh? But how'd you...?

253
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,500
Phantom Rabbits,
you're under arrest!

254
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,250
Ka-Kazuharu?

255
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,708
You're a girl?

256
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,166
It can't be.
I don't believe it.

257
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,916
I always knew
I'd get a leg up

258
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,666
on you three eventually.

259
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,833
So how'd you
figure out who we were?

260
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:24,958
Between your demeanor

261
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,666
when I'd come into
the Nap Rabbit Café

262
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,583
and those
playing cards you use,

263
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,875
I had my suspicions.

264
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,250
I gambled on a hunch
and set up this trap.

265
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,875
Voila. You fell for it
hook, line, and sinker.

266
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,000
Then... Black Snow's
working for you?

267
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,000
This man does work for me,

268
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:44,541
but there's no such
person as Black Snow!

269
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,708
I'm Yukinari Sasaki!

270
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,750
And Mr. Machida
generously allowed us

271
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,791
to borrow one
of his castles.

272
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,291
I-I wanna talk to a lawyer.

273
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,083
You don't
have any evidence,

274
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,708
no jury on Earth
is gonna find--

275
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,041
Koyomi managed
to steal that disc

276
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,375
with the information
about Black Snow

277
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,083
right out from
underneath Kazuharu's nose.

278
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,958
Hey, that was my voice!

279
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,083
Do I sound that
cute in real life?

280
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,291
Indeed, it's
clear as a bell.

281
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,375
It'll be Exhibit 'A'
at your trial.

282
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,375
So that's what you're
going to do with it.

283
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,625
What?! You're gonna use
that to put us in jail?

284
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,958
No fair!

285
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,750
They shouldn't let people
like you be detectives!

286
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,916
Careful Miharu,
you're about to have

287
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,791
a wardrobe malfunction.

288
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,083
Huh?

289
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,583
Gah! The goo pulled
my clothes down.

290
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,291
Moving just
makes it worse.

291
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,791
Huh? No!

292
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:37,125
My word, look at those
stretchy tights, Koyomi.

293
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,916
No!

294
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,500
Kirie, I am so
sorry I shot you.

295
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,125
But... Kazuharu...

296
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,583
If only I'd known it was you.

297
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,125
I never would
have fired my gun.

298
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,166
I should have
told you my secret.

299
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,958
I'm sorry, too.

300
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,291
It's all right.

301
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,458
I suppose this
makes us even now.

302
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:19,125
Turn yourself
in to the police.

303
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,500
It's the right thing to do.

304
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,125
I can help you.

305
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,791
Kazuharu...

306
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,625
I need you to trust me, Kirie.

307
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,791
No! No!
Don't fall for it!

308
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,375
No, Kirie, don't!

309
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,458
Huh?

310
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,791
What is this... oil?

311
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,166
Is this another one
of your sneaky traps?

312
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,375
I don't think
this is another trap.

313
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:45,125
Huh?

314
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:49,166
Ta-da! It's the
Phantom Rabbit Petite!

315
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,000
You three can
thank me later.

316
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,708
What? Now there's
a Phantom Rabbit Petite?

317
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,666
Wow, she must have
followed us over here.

318
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,833
I told you I could be
useful for stuff, remember?

319
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,875
But nobody listened!

320
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,000
Okay, who wants
to go back home?

321
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,750
Me!

322
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,083
Maybe next time, right?

323
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,291
Come back!

324
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,041
Go and arrest me... in Hell!

325
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:20,541
It's nothing personal. Bye!

326
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,416
Congrats, Tomoka.
You're an excellent Rabbit.

327
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,708
Yeah! I told you so!

328
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,041
I didn't even know
you could do this with Ebi.

329
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,375
Hold on!

330
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,583
Huh?

331
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,708
You're all under arrest!

332
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,583
Damn Rabbits!

333
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,458
Gotcha!

334
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:50,416
Phantom Rabbits, why don't
you surrender already?

335
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,958
He's very persistent,
isn't he, Kirie?

336
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,791
Hey, Koyomi...

337
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:58,541
Wow. It's amazing
how stubborn he is.

338
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,916
Just hang on
Scotland Yard Big Brother.

339
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,375
He can't hold onto
that rope forever.

340
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,583
What do I do?

341
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:08,375
Kirie!

342
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,333
Huh?

343
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,416
Convince the
others to give up.

344
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,166
Kirie, I'm begging you.

345
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,458
Huh? But how can I...?

346
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:15,958
Remember Kirie,
it doesn't matter

347
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,833
how much you like Kazuharu
and he likes you back,

348
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,000
you really shouldn't try

349
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:24,750
to break up
the Phantom Rabbits.

350
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:28,666
Dammit. Well, in
that case, take this!

351
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,833
And this! And this!

352
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,833
Stop the Ebi,
I wanna get off!

353
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,833
We'll be okay,
just hold on.

354
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:36,833
It's not gonna work.

355
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:40,166
Poor Ebi's
running out of air.

356
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,666
Do doo.

357
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,083
Nya nya nya
nya nya nyaaa!

358
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh no! There's too
much weight on here!

359
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,583
If we don't think
of something right away,

360
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,791
we're gonna crash!

361
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,500
We have to dump
something, and quick!

362
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,291
[GIRLS screaming]

363
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,125
Kirie!

364
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,625
Yeah?

365
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,541
I want you to promise me...

366
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,666
Promise...

367
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,333
Turn yourself in.
It's the only way.

368
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,000
Okay then.

369
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:28,208
Kazuharu!

370
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,875
He did that to
save us, didn't he?

371
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,041
What a courageous man.

372
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:41,291
Kazuharu.

373
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,250
I'm so glad
that you're all right!

374
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,125
I thought you were a goner.

375
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,625
Look, that lamp caught him.

376
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,166
How is he gonna
get down from there?

377
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,000
I wanna thank you for
honoring your promise, Kirie.

378
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:07,208
I did it... I did it...
because I...

379
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,875
Not so fast.

380
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,708
I can't just let
you have Kazuharu

381
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,666
all to yourself, Kirie.

382
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,000
You're both too
young for Kazuharu.

383
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,375
Um, I'm just the right
age to be his girlfriend.

384
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,083
Your sex appeal
hasn't had a chance

385
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,375
to mature like mine.

386
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,583
Keep dreaming!

387
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,041
Everyone knows guys
prefer younger women.

388
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,625
What are you talking about?

389
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:29,541
Kazuharu has loved me
for a long time now!

390
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,875
No, me! He loves me!

391
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,375
He actually loves me.

392
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,875
He loves Tomo best!

393
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,708
You know that's not true.

394
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,041
He winked at me.

395
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,750
Bravo Detective Fukuyama.

396
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,125
I think their days
of crime are over.

397
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,041
Why thank you,
but this time around,

398
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,291
I'm the one who pilfered
something outrageous.

399
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,958
What?

400
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,333
Oh, just their heart.

401
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,708
It's a masterpiece!

402
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,208
[EVERYONE] Huh?

403
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,416
What the hell was that?!

404
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,250
We shot a scene
after that one

405
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,416
where the Phantom Rabbits
team up and kick your ass.

406
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,750
Really?

407
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,916
And what the hell was up
with that superglue scene?

408
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,208
Superglue?

409
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,791
We never shot it half naked,
you damn pervert!

410
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,583
Why'd I change it around?

411
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,625
Right, I'm me.

412
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,916
Lying bastard!
Lying bastard!

413
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,250
This movie needs
a whole lot more Tomo.

414
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,375
Nya nya!

415
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,333
That bathtub scene
was so embarrassing.

416
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,833
Big Brother, I wanted to play

417
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,916
the part of
Yukinari's soul mate.

418
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,791
Why did you kick
me so hard, Kirie?

419
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,083
This is the best movie ever!

420
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,416
I'm gonna get that mask

421
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,666
and become the
Gold Mamo-ranger!

422
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,458
I'll get the attention
of all the girls

423
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,875
when I screen my
big-budget masterpiece

424
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,625
at the school festival.

425
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,000
They're not gonna
let you show this crap!

426
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:28,458
Originally, the festival was
held for ceremonial purposes.

427
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:29,375
Oh.

428
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,458
Back in the old days,

429
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,916
it was a chance
to offer sacrifices

430
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,416
to the various gods.

431
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,916
I don't think you
should sacrifice things

432
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,458
at a school festival.

433
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:37,750
Hey, come on out!

434
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,541
That's how you
summon them, see?

435
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:42,291
Girls Bravo Season
Two, next episode,

436
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,791
"School Festival is Bravo!"

437
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,083
Bring a friend!

438
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,500
Come out devil!

439
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:50,125
From the blue forest
metropolis, I summon thee.
