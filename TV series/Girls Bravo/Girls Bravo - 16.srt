1
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,541
Ahh.

2
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,458
I did it!

3
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,875
There's nothing the
mature Tomoka can't do!

4
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,458
Listen up, Ebi,

5
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:27,458
I have an announcement!

6
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,750
Nya?

7
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:29,958
You know, I've spent
too much time having fun,

8
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,041
so starting tomorrow,
I'm gonna do my best

9
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,333
to find a husband for Maharu!

10
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,875
Nya nyo?

11
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,375
I'm on a mission!
Be back later!

12
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,833
I'll show 'em
what I'm made of!

13
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:48,541
Tomo's gonna find her
a man lickety-split!

14
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,041
Nya nya!

15
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,458
Huh?

16
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,833
Sorry Ebi, you can't
come with me this time.

17
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,208
It's super important
romance stuff.

18
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,791
Nya...

19
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,875
Uh, those sad Ebi eyes
won't work on me.

20
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,166
Nya nya...

21
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,333
All right, come on.

22
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,041
Oh, hey, Tomoka!

23
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,208
Huh?

24
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,083
Hey, Kirie! Whatcha doin'?

25
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:14,291
Koyomi's not doing her job,

26
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,166
so Tomo's going to
work especially hard.

27
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,541
Work especially hard?

28
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,250
Well yeah,
somebody's gotta find

29
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,333
a husband for
Miharu's big sister!

30
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,791
Oh yeah, I'd forgotten.

31
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,583
What's that for?
It's a really important job!

32
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,750
I didn't mean
anything by it.

33
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,166
Just be careful that you

34
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,375
don't work too hard
at it, okay Tomoka?

35
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,083
You still need to get
plenty of sleep at your age.

36
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:39,166
Tomo is mature enough
to work 25 hours a day!

37
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,708
Well, I guess you're
a pretty hard worker.

38
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,666
Hey, I know!

39
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,625
I heard they're taping
something with Poyon

40
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,250
in front of the train
station today.

41
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,583
You wanna go and see it?

42
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,000
What?! Poyon's
really down there?

43
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,833
Uh, forget about it!

44
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,625
You're using that little
kid stuff to distract me,

45
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:56,958
but it's not gonna work!

46
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,666
Why not? I mean,
you are still a kid.

47
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,041
What's the hurry?

48
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,375
Enjoy your childhood
while you have it!

49
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,583
So, let's go!

50
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:08,791
Tomo's not a little kid, okay!

51
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:14,291
You-You always insist on
treating me like a little kid.

52
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,791
You don't think
Tomo can do anything!

53
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,833
Hey! Tomoka wait!

54
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,541
Don't talk to me,
you boob monster!

55
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:28,916
She thinks
I'm a boob monster?

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,750
I can't stand her!

57
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,958
The boob monster's
gonna feel pretty stupid

58
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,041
when I come back there
with a husband for Maharu.

59
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,333
Oh, Tomoka.

60
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,125
Huh?

61
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,833
Well, well,
fancy meeting you here.

62
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,208
Lucky me. It's the pervert.

63
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,583
Nya.

64
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,041
Such sterling
manners you have.

65
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,625
Just think of me
as your big brother.

66
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,666
Yes, big brother Kazuharu.

67
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,875
So then, where to, Sis?

68
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,666
Tomo's busy with her work.

69
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,500
Go chase a girl, okay?

70
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,708
Oh. Working, eh?

71
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:00,958
That's right.

72
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,250
I'm supposed to find

73
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:06,250
a good-looking,
sweet, mature Earthling

74
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,833
and send him back
to Seiren for Maharu.

75
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,250
In that case, look no further!

76
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,625
I know it won't be easy.

77
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,458
I, Kazuharu Fukuyama,
was meant for greater things

78
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,041
than tedious monogamy.

79
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:19,166
But if I'm the only man
for the job, take me!

80
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,125
You must be
dumber than you look.

81
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,500
I got in a lot of trouble

82
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,541
for bringing you back
last time, pervert.

83
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,583
Hey...

84
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,583
I have work to do, okay?

85
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,666
Stop following me
around already!

86
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,916
Who says I'm following?

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,125
Maybe I have to go
this direction, too.

88
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,083
Huh?

89
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:42,750
Huh?

90
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,125
Hmm.

91
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,166
[BAKER] Thank you!

92
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,333
Have a good afternoon!

93
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,250
[FUJII] My gosh, Kirie.

94
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:58,250
Fujii! Long time no see.

95
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,375
That is Kirie, isn't it?

96
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,583
Yes...

97
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,333
So, uh...
how've you been?

98
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:08,125
Been good.
How long's it been?

99
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,916
About a year now?

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,666
That sounds about right.

101
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,833
Tell me, Kirie...

102
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,583
Is your answer...

103
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,375
...is it still the same?

104
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,208
No, it's fine.

106
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,875
Sorry. You know...

107
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,333
for bringing it
up again like that.

108
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,583
I didn't mean to be pushy.

109
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,791
So I guess that means
you still like him.

110
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,958
Ah.

111
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:40,291
Well then... Good luck!

112
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,750
Wh-Wh-What was
that all about?

113
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,250
That bittersweet
moment was totally random.

114
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,625
That must be the guy who
used to follow her around.

115
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,541
Poor fool still
hasn't learned.

116
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,500
The boob monster
sure is popular.

117
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:05,291
What's up?

118
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,916
I wonder if Kirie's
getting sick or something.

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,958
She was acting fine before.

120
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,458
Hmm.

121
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,500
[NAKAGAWA] Thanks, Kirie.

122
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,000
No problem.

123
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,625
After all it's my fault

124
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,125
you ended up here
in the first place.

125
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,708
No, it was an accident.

126
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,791
You were busy
beating up Yukinari.

127
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:28,125
It's not like you meant
to throw him onto me.

128
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,375
Hmm?

129
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:35,125
Uh, no. Nevermind.

130
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,166
Is something wrong?

131
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,583
Your face is all red.
Fever maybe?

132
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,916
He totally likes her.
Is she stupid?

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,875
That bastard, she should
be checking me for fever.

134
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,500
Get better soon, okay?

135
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,083
Yeah, thanks for coming.

136
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,208
The plot thickens.

137
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,375
What does that mean?

138
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,041
Damn that Nakagawa,

139
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,458
another rival for
Kirie's affections.

140
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,208
Huh? Why are they
all in love with her?

141
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,708
Nya!

142
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,791
Men tend to mistake
Kirie's friendliness

143
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,666
for more romantic interest.

144
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,166
Maybe she's letting off
some sort of pheromone.

145
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,208
It's 'cause
she's a boob monster!

146
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,291
A boob monster, eh?

147
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,708
I prefer the
term boob-irific.

148
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,750
Stop following me around pesty.

149
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,166
I'm following Kirie,
the same as you.

150
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,916
Apropos of nothing,

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,041
weren't you
supposed to work today?

152
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,500
I'm studying Kirie,

153
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,708
since all the men
are crazy about her.

154
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,125
I'm gonna figure out
the boob monster pheromone

155
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,291
and use it to
find Maharu a guy.

156
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,625
Cut it out!

157
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,041
Hmm?

158
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,875
I'm begging you Ms. Kojima,

159
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,375
just give me
a moment of your time.

160
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,833
Whatever, stop pulling
on my skirt! I'll listen!

161
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,291
I'm so glad
you're ready to listen.

162
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,083
Pick me, and
you'll live in comfort

163
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,583
for the rest of your days.

164
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,375
It'll be a very happy life.

165
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,416
Whattya say?

166
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,083
Uh, well I--

167
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,833
Hey lady, um, will
you be on my team?

168
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:03,791
And um... can you
be my real big sister?

169
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,250
They're surrounding Kirie!

170
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,166
Love sick fools, all of them.

171
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,625
Ebi!

172
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,375
Nya!

173
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,375
What was that?

174
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,666
Wh-Wh-What the
hell just happened?

175
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,583
It's Ebi's secret weapon.

176
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,083
I call it E-Beam.
Cool, huh?

177
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,916
Nya nya.

178
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,875
Sublime.

179
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,375
I'm gonna rescue
the person in trouble,

180
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,958
since I'm super-mature,

181
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:49,000
even if it is Kirie, who always
treats Tomo like a little kid.

182
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,833
Now I understand.

183
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,166
Understand what?

184
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,875
Obviously you want
Kirie to recognize

185
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,875
the fact that you're an adult.

186
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,375
Yeah, like I care what she--

187
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,250
Hey, I have an idea.

188
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,250
Hmm?

189
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,291
You follow
Kirie and protect her

190
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,875
from whatever
trouble comes up.

191
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,458
Hmm?

192
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,541
She would have to respect your
abilities then, would she not?

193
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,833
Oh yeah?

194
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,166
So what's in it for
the big dumb pervert, huh?

195
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,166
I'd be more than
happy to support

196
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,291
your endeavor any way I can.

197
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,208
Hmm.

198
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:23,041
But don't you
want Kirie's respect?

199
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,166
To have her
regard you as an adult?

200
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,041
Yeah, I'll do it.

201
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,750
I'll double-cross Tomoka later

202
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:35,208
and reap the rewards
from a grateful Kirie.

203
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,708
Thanks for all your help today.

204
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:41,333
I'm gonna show you
just how thankful I am.

205
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,833
Here. We. Go.

206
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,083
I bet the big dumb pervert
will try to double-cross me.

207
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:57,833
No matter,
I'll get rid of him

208
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:58,958
once he's
outlived his usefulness.

209
00:10:59,041 --> 00:10:59,958
And then...

210
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,041
I'm sorry,
how could I have thought

211
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:01,708
that you were
a little kid, Tomoka?

212
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:02,833
You're super mature!

213
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:03,375
By the way,
I'd like you to have this.

214
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,250
Please take it.

215
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,916
Wow! This is the best
apology gift ever!

216
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,166
Yeah!

217
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,958
Do my bidding, child pawn.

218
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,166
Even a mindless
drone has his uses.

219
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,375
So, onward!

220
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,041
Nya. Nya. Nya.

221
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,166
Yeah! Let's do it!

222
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,125
Nya! Nya!

223
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,916
Hey!

224
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,166
Hey are you all right?

225
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,666
Any time!

226
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,250
Fire, Ebi!

227
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,833
Thanks, lady.

228
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,250
Don't run out
into the street, okay?

229
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,750
Okay.

230
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,166
Uh, are you still alive?

231
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,541
I was sort of
expecting the E-Beam.

232
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,375
Me too. I guess Ebi has
to recharge or something.

233
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,041
Nya.

234
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,125
Well, at least the truck
didn't run them over.

235
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:39,333
I'm sorry,
just wait right here.

236
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,916
I'll get that
balloon back for you.

237
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,250
Thank you.

238
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,375
Well, so far so good.

239
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,791
Yeah. We rock!

240
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,791
[PERV] Hey babycakes,
do those legs go all the way up?

241
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,041
How about you and me
have a good time?

242
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:10,583
Hua!

243
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,416
[WOMAN] No way!
Help me grab some!

244
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,541
Wouldn't it be easier to
protect her if we were closer?

245
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,666
No way! Not 'til you start
keeping your hands to yourself!

246
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,333
Besides, it's not our fault

247
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,541
Kirie keeps getting
into so much trouble.

248
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,000
Right you are.

249
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,041
But her devil-may-care
lifestyle is so alluring!

250
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,083
Living every moment with
her as though it's my last!

251
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,875
That truck hit you too hard.

252
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,875
Now then, it's high time
we told Kirie the truth!

253
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,666
That we were
the only thing standing

254
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,083
between her and
utter catastrophe!

255
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,583
Now you're talking!

256
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,875
I just had a great idea.

257
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,083
How 'bout we save
Kirie one more time?

258
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,125
Hmm.

259
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,208
Hey girl, you got
somewhere to be?

260
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:31,083
Cause we think you should
hang out with us, right guys?

261
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,666
No thanks, you sleezeballs.

262
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,125
Hold on!

263
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,583
Huh?

264
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,791
If you lay so much as
one finger on my woman,

265
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,458
then this sunset
will be your last.

266
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,583
Fukuyama?

267
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,166
What'd you say?

268
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,875
Hmm. Fear not!

269
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,250
I'll save you from
these ruffians, Kirie!

270
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,333
Huh?

271
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,250
Fight me,
dregs of humanity!

272
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,791
Whatever, it's
your funeral cupcake.

273
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,000
Teach 'im a lesson, fellas!

274
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,291
Hmph. Just as we'd planned.

275
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,708
First I heroically beat up
these guys Tomoka bribed,

276
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,041
and then a hero's welcome!

277
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:08,083
Oh, thank you.
My virtue is safe.

278
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,333
Drink up, hero.

279
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,625
I'll dodge the punch
coming at me from the right.

280
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:19,208
And counter with a good kick.

281
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,416
Fukuyama!

282
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,500
Hey punks!

283
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:22,541
Huh?

284
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,791
What's your problem?

285
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,375
Beat up wimps...

286
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,958
...in Hell!

287
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,875
Bastards.

288
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,375
You better go home now, okay?

289
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,416
Just like I planned it.

290
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,125
The stupid pervert's
been taken care of.

291
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,250
Have the blonde guy
pay your doctor bills.

292
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,750
He's loaded.

293
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:57,541
Tomoka, you little imp.

294
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,208
You betrayed me.

295
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,208
There's no easy
way to say this...

296
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,666
She doesn't like you!

297
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:09,000
Anyway, Kirie, guess who--

298
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,375
Hey wait, where'd she go?

299
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,750
Kirie, wait up!

300
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,041
Oh, hey everybody.
What's the big hurry?

301
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:24,791
You see, Tomoka's
been gone all day long,

302
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,250
and she isn't home yet.

303
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,583
Huh?

304
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,083
We've been looking all
over for her, but no luck.

305
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,791
You haven't
seen her have you?

306
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,500
I did run into
Tomoka this afternoon,

307
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,083
right in front of your house.

308
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,458
How 'bout after that?

309
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,125
No, that's the
last I saw of her.

310
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:42,541
I see...

311
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,958
Maybe we should look
on the main street again.

312
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,208
Yeah! Good idea!

313
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:48,791
Kirie?

314
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:49,625
Huh?

315
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,291
Any idea where she could be?

316
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,875
I didn't know she was gone.

317
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,333
Come on you guys.

318
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,583
Everybody cover
a different direction.

319
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,791
Yeah!

320
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:58,916
Right!

321
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,333
Thank you! Have a good day!

322
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:07,291
Damn that traitor.

323
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:11,375
I lost Kirie.
Where could she be?

324
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,833
Where am I?

325
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:16,333
Nya nya...

326
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,875
Huh?

327
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,583
Nyo nyo...

328
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,041
We're fine, Ebi.

329
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,875
Super mature people like
Tomo never get lost, right?

330
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:31,041
Nyo?

331
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,666
Tomo is so brave.

332
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,666
We're not scared, Ebi,
we're not lost!

333
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,166
Tomo is such a big girl!

334
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,958
We're gonna be fine!

335
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:47,291
Tomoka! Tomoka!

336
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,750
Tomoka was so angry
at me earlier today.

337
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,625
What if she ran off
because of what I said?

338
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,250
Tomo is not a
little kid, okay?

339
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,791
I really shouldn't
have called her that.

340
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:06,666
Don't talk to me
you boob monster!

341
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:13,250
Well I don't think
I'm a boob monster.

342
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,291
Anyway, I have
to find Tomoka.

343
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,375
I should've kept the
pervert around longer, huh?

344
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,250
At least he knows
where my house is.

345
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,083
I'm pretty hungry.

346
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:45,000
Yuh-huh.

347
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,583
It's cold out here.

348
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,833
Nya.

349
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,333
It's my fault.

350
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:08,041
I'm alone because
I was mean to people.

351
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,458
Hiding under a bridge.

352
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:23,250
You've got a lot of
nerve running off like that.

353
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,750
How stupid can you be?

354
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:39,208
You know, you're gonna catch
a cold if you stay out here.

355
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,875
What?

356
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,541
Aren't you angry? I mean...

357
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,750
Of course not.

358
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,625
With all the hearts I break,

359
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,958
I'm used to odd
behavior from women.

360
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:58,041
Kirie and the others are
still out looking for you.

361
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,041
Really?

362
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,625
They called me
on my cell phone.

363
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,208
I mean, it's not
like you bothered

364
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,458
telling them
where you were going.

365
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,666
What? You thought
they didn't care?

366
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,125
Anyhow, I'm glad
you're all right.

367
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,791
My women-only paradise

368
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,958
will require at least
one devious little girl.

369
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:26,625
I think the pervert's
nothing but a big dummy.

370
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:31,958
I do. But I think
he's a nice big dummy.

371
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,666
Come on, Tomoka.

372
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,750
They'll all be glad to see you.

373
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:46,041
Okay, Big Brother Kazuharu.

374
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,708
Tomoka!

375
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,791
Fukuyama!

376
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,208
Well? Did you find Tomoka?

377
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,916
Shh...

378
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,500
Thank goodness.

379
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,833
She's had a long day, ya know?

380
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,583
And a full one.

381
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,208
Keeping up with you
is hard work, Kirie.

382
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,208
Huh?

383
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,708
Well now I get it.

384
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:22,833
Tomoka, I'm sorry
I called you a little kid.

385
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:26,083
Hey Fukuyama,
I guess you're not so bad.

386
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,791
I mean, you're the one
who found Tomoka after all.

387
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,125
Anytime.

388
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:33,208
I'm sowing the seeds
for my women-only paradise.

389
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,583
Huh?

390
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,250
Don't worry,

391
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,750
I've already reserved
a special spot in it for you.

392
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,250
Thank you.

393
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,833
Whew! It's good to work
up a sweat on the job.

394
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:29,583
I don't think there's
anything good about this job.

395
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,250
What are you talking about?

396
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,250
All the people are
looking at you, Koyomi!

397
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,500
They love you!

398
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:37,041
But everybody around us
is dressed so strangely.

399
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,208
They make me really nervous.

400
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:41,041
Girls Bravo Season Two,
next episode,

401
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,583
"Bravo at the Part-Time Job!"

402
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,208
Work it, Koyomi!

403
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:49,250
Oh, Mother, there are so many
bizarre people on this planet.
