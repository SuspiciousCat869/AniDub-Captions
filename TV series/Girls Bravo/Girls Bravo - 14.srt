1
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:06,291
Love wisdom number 997.

2
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,666
People say you
can't force love,

3
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,291
but a well-timed
push never hurt anything.

4
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,000
Love wisdom number 998.

5
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,458
Embody love.

6
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,750
When people ask,
"Where's the love?"

7
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,000
tell them "Right here."

8
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:26,583
Love wisdom number 999.

9
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,625
Love is an endless path.

10
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:33,291
Walk at a brisk pace,
but be careful not to trip.

11
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,791
Hmm.

12
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:51,958
All right. I'll do
my very best! Yeah!

13
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:03,041
At last, we've
reached our destination.

14
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,958
This is the place where
ambitious young people

15
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,791
arrive with nothing
but a dream

16
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,333
and work to make it come true.

17
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:13,208
Come one, come all to
the fabled Ikebukuro!

18
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,125
Miharu?

19
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,041
Am I mistaken?

20
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,500
No, Ikebukuro is pretty neat.

21
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,708
Today is my first time
going out with Yukinari.

22
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,083
I'm really excited!

23
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,750
Huh? Yeah, I guess we
haven't ever gone out

24
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,458
just the two of us before.

25
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,958
And today we get to!

26
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,583
That's right!
Well, are you ready?

27
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,958
Yeah! Let's go!

28
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,375
You kids have
a good time now.

29
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,875
Fukuyama, you remember
our agreement, right?

30
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:48,916
Of course.

31
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,958
Today I sit
impotently by and watch

32
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,875
Puny-nari fumble
through their date.

33
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,125
No interference, right?

34
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,458
That's the rule.

35
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,250
And don't you forget it.

36
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,750
That's why we
went to the trouble

37
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,458
of following them all the
way down here this afternoon.

38
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,750
I'm gonna make sure you
don't try anything shady.

39
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,583
You flatter me.

40
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,416
Who the hell do you think I am?
Harry Houdini?!

41
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,666
If I let you run wild,

42
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,125
who knows what kind
of trouble you'd get into.

43
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
This is for your own good.

44
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes. It. Is.

45
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,500
Trotting me around
like some disobedient dog?

46
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,583
Have you no shame, woman?

47
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,750
Thinking back to our moment

48
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,958
of Sapphic bliss
with Kosame, are we?

49
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,750
Quiet!

50
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,708
It's not too late to
add a muzzle you know.

51
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,000
Now, let's go!

52
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,291
Hey, Miharu, you done?

53
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,666
This is kinda weird for me.

54
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,250
Oh. Okay!

55
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,916
M-M-M-M-M-M-iharu!

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,875
Why on earth did you wanna
go lingerie shopping anyway?

57
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,083
Nothing says
"a tiger in the sack"

58
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,833
like seductive lingerie!

59
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,916
What are you talking about?!

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,083
Anyway, Yukinari, which of
these gets you hot and bothered,

61
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:15,583
the panties that I'm wearing
now, or the revealing pair?

62
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,916
Isn't she too young
to be buying lingerie?

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,500
Really! I bet that guy she's
with is a tiger in the sack.

64
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,166
[CASHIER] Have fun you kids!

65
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,791
Wow! You're so fast, Yukinari!

66
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:30,958
Am I fast? I guess I am.

67
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,916
Good. Glad to hear it.
Okay. Great.

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,500
Well then,
on to our next stop.

69
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,375
Huh?

70
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,000
It's over there!

71
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:46,416
Some geckos, some turtles,
some seahorse, and some viper.

72
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,208
Don't worry.
This'll give him a giant boner!

73
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,541
A giant boner?

74
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,166
Yeah! By nightfall,
it'll be super hard.

75
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,250
Super hard?

76
00:05:56,916 --> 00:06:00,833
Yukinari! This nice man
made something for you!

77
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:04,541
He said it'll give you
a giant super-hard boner!

78
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,416
You have no idea what
you're talking about, do you?

79
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,166
Ah, the poor little guy.

80
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,583
Best of luck to you, Limpy.

81
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:14,458
Have fun you kids!

82
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,916
Wow! You're so
strong, Yukinari!

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,500
That's right, Miharu,
I'm all muscle.

84
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,541
Come on. Can't we
go to the movies now?

85
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,875
Um, there is one more
shop I'd like to visit.

86
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,750
Huh? There's one more?

87
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,916
Wow! It's like
Poyon's magic wand.

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,791
We should buy it for Tomoka!

89
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,458
Hey, would you
like to have one?

90
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,916
Uh, I think Tomoka would
have to turn me into a girl

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,500
before that thing
would do me any good.

92
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,791
You could use it all right.

93
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,125
Think outside the box.

94
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:48,125
Um, Yukinari?

95
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,750
I'm fine.
Let's just go to the movies.

96
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,916
Yeah! There's a movie
I've been wanting to see.

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,291
What's it about?

98
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,541
Here we are!

99
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,791
But what could you
possibly wanna see here?!

100
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,708
If a couple watches
one of these movies,

101
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,291
they have a good time
when they get home.

102
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,708
Come on, Yukinari.

103
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,583
You and I are about to climb

104
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,916
the stairs of
adulthood together.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,291
I'm just gonna
pretend that made sense.

106
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,000
Huh?

107
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,458
Miharu's acting weird.

108
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:26,458
She's done her homework.
I can tell.

109
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,625
Why do I have a hunch that
you're about to piss me off?

110
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,750
What is this tripe?

111
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:36,833
Ever wonder why Kazuharu
Fukuyama is such a lady killer?

112
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,791
I share my methods
with the world in my book,

113
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:43,791
"The 999 Walls
between the Idiots and Me."

114
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,791
I gave Miharu a copy of it.

115
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,541
She's put it to good use.

116
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,916
Huh?

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,708
First, you memorize
the 999 love truths in the book,

118
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,291
and then you apply them
to the appropriate situations.

119
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,125
All the places Miharu is
taking Puny-nari on their date

120
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,041
are Fukuyama-approved locations,

121
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:04,583
specifically intended
to put couples in the mood.

122
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,333
Idiot! Are you ready
to feel like a total bastard

123
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,458
if your bad advice
ruins their date?

124
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,125
Well of course I'm ready!

125
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,291
I've always made it quite plain

126
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,791
that I don't want Miharu and
Puny-nari to end up together.

127
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:22,166
Come on, you're not exactly
rooting for them, are you?

128
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,333
Hey!

129
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,458
Why you look down
your nose at my motives,

130
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:29,500
if you're so unwilling to
be honest with yourself?

131
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:34,458
It's the official "Walls between
the Idiots and Me" website.

132
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,708
You should give it a look.

133
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,083
Whatever you're doing
certainly hasn't worked.

134
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:43,041
Not my brand new
satellite cell phone!

135
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:48,291
Worry about yourself, dumbass.

136
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,791
Kirie really should learn
how to curb that temper.

137
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,875
Tying me up and beating me
is all well and good,

138
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,125
but I damn near died!

139
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:06,416
However, at least now I'm free
of my irksome chaperone!

140
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:12,041
So far Miharu's done exactly
what I outlined in the book,

141
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,125
but what if things go too far
and I'm not there to stop her

142
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,583
from throwing
herself at Puny-nari?

143
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,125
I'd be hoisted
by my own petard.

144
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,416
I'll have to
keep an eye on them.

145
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,833
I'm sorry Yukinari.

146
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,500
You don't seem to be
having much fun on our date.

147
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:35,625
I did everything just
like the book said I should.

148
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,250
A book?

149
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:41,250
That does explain a lot,
but you know, it's our date.

150
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,416
We should do it our way!

151
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,125
Wow! I can see
really far through these.

152
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,583
Yukinari, which direction
is our house from here?

153
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,041
I think it's
somewhere over there.

154
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,166
Wow! If I can
see that far away,

155
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,625
maybe I can even see Seiren.

156
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,375
Right, Yukinari?

157
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:29,250
Maybe. I guess
anything's possible.

158
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:35,333
Aww, man. What am I doing?

159
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,708
I can't just sit back
and watch this anymore.

160
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,500
Are you tired?
We've had a pretty full day.

161
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:01,125
No way! I'm too busy
having fun to be tired.

162
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,708
It kind of feels
like I get to eat

163
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,875
the Lantern Festival and
New Year's Day for dinner!

164
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,333
You can't eat either
of those things, silly!

165
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,666
No, I guess that I can't.
That's too bad.

166
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,375
But I think today
was the most fun

167
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,833
I've had since
I came to Earth.

168
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,958
I saw really far
with a telescope,

169
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,750
and that movie
was interesting!

170
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,708
And also...
there was... um...

171
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,541
Oh, I almost
forgot the best part!

172
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,708
Hmm? What do you mean, Miharu?

173
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,083
Whoa! You made all this?

174
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,208
Yeah, I woke up early
this morning to do it!

175
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,750
Please! Dig in!

176
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,708
Good idea!
Thanks for the food!

177
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:49,750
All right.

178
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,000
Ahh! M-M-M-M-Miharu!

179
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,875
Why are you taking
your clothes off in public?

180
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,458
Huh? You see in my dating book,

181
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,375
it says you should
take off your clothes

182
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,583
and get freaky in the
bushes if you go to the park.

183
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,666
Oh, by the way,
what does "get freaky" mean?

184
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,833
The book doesn't say.

185
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,625
You don't wanna know, okay?

186
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,541
Just please,
put your clothes back on.

187
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,625
But... I thought...

188
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,000
You should
look up "get freaky"

189
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,666
in the book's
glossary, Miharu!

190
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,916
Or if you're not too busy,

191
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,791
I'd be happy to demonstrate.

192
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,833
Yeah! Show me how to get freaky.

193
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,416
Fukuyama! Why are you here?

194
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,333
I merely wanted to observe
my pupil in action,

195
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,916
so I followed
you all afternoon.

196
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,375
Observe your pupil?
What does that mean?!

197
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,541
Miharu,
you pre-pubescent fool.

198
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,500
Well hello there, Miharu!

199
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,166
Are you putting all the things

200
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,041
you learned in
that book to good use?

201
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,833
Yeah! Now I know how
to be a tiger in the sack!

202
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:49,125
Wait! You wrote that dating
book she was trying to follow?

203
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,375
Guilty as charged.

204
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,583
Our Miharu's a very
quick learner,

205
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,750
but I'm going to be the one
to give her the final exam.

206
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:00,666
So I'm here to put
the kibosh on your date.

207
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,416
Tada!

208
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,750
Huh?

209
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,500
Huh? That's the bento
Miharu made for our date!

210
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:10,125
Dating tips aren't free.
Fukuyama away!

211
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,041
Dammit! Fukuyama!

212
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,958
But... Yukinari!

213
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,458
As soon as I rescue our bento,
I'll come right back.

214
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:21,208
Wait for me at the benches,
okay Miharu? Just sit tight.

215
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,916
But...

216
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,000
Okay.

217
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,750
That dumbass.

218
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,958
Mommy, where did you go?

219
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,333
What's wrong, little girl?

220
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,083
Are you looking
for your mother?

221
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,375
I-I was looking at toys,

222
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,125
and then I turned
around and she was gone.

223
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:04,750
I-I looked around a lot,
but she's not anywhere.

224
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,375
I can't...

225
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,416
Here.

226
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,083
First have something to drink,

227
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,208
and then we can go
find your mother, okay?

228
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,333
Fukuyama, hand over
that bento, right now!

229
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:32,166
Oh, he's using his big
boy voice. I'm so scared.

230
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,625
I guess I have to
take it back by force!

231
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,916
Hey!

232
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,791
Poor Puny-nari.

233
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:47,875
You must have no idea
how weak you really are.

234
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,750
How else could you even dream
of trying to overpower me?

235
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,541
Well, I'd love to
watch you tear up,

236
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,750
but I've got
a date with bento.

237
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:58,625
You're far too scrawny to
date Miharu, and you know it!

238
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,708
Shut up!

239
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:05,708
Hey. Puny-nari, get off!

240
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,583
I don't swing that way,

241
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,250
so whatever you're
thinking, forget it.

242
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,916
I-I know I'm not
strong enough to defeat you,

243
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,708
but I can't just give up.

244
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,666
Miharu got up early to make
that bento for the two of us,

245
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,000
and I'm not gonna
let you run off with it!

246
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,625
Stop molesting my leg
you little freak!

247
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,375
Unhand me!

248
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,875
Give it back!

249
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,708
Yukinari, you putz.

250
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:39,458
Get off, dammit.

251
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,958
Seems your best
wasn't good enough.

252
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,708
Hey, you!

253
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,250
Huh?

254
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:52,041
Huh?

255
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,041
We're the frog and cow
comedy duo at your service.

256
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:57,958
We saw you steal the bento
and run away with it.

257
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,291
Yeah, and that
is no laughing matter.

258
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,791
Don't worry, little boy,

259
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,250
Frog and Cow are
here to help you.

260
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,208
Have you lost your mind, Kirie?

261
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,458
Shut up, dumbass!

262
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:12,250
We're the frog and cow
comedy duo, remember?

263
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,375
Are you ready Mr. Frog?

264
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,916
Ready and willing!

265
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,375
Good!

266
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,541
Yeah!

267
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,375
Steal lunch...

268
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,500
...in Hell!

269
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:34,541
Hey you, little boy.
Here ya go.

270
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:41,791
Thanks Kiri-- nevermind.
Thank you both.

271
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,208
Thanks, Kirie.

272
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,708
Dummy.

273
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:01,750
Bye lady! Thank you!

274
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,833
It's so late!
I didn't know.

275
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,458
I have to get back!

276
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,666
Pardon me, could I trouble
you for some directions?

277
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,708
Oh. Oh dear.

278
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,833
Hello. What can I
help you with, ma'am?

279
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,041
You see, I have to return
to the train station now,

280
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,250
but I've forgotten
how to get there.

281
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:31,583
Oh, I know where the train
station is. I'll show you.

282
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:32,833
Well thank you, Miss.

283
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,666
That's very thoughtful of you.

284
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,291
Huh?

285
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,125
Miharu!

286
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,708
Miharu!

287
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,541
Where could she be?

288
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,875
I have to find her,
right away!

289
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,916
Ah. Thank you so
much for your kindness.

290
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,166
I'm glad I could help.
Take care!

291
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:11,583
What should I do?
It's almost 7 at night!

292
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,166
She's still not here.

293
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,708
Yukinari!

294
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:54,541
It's been 3 hours
since I left.

295
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,125
But Yukinari
told me to sit tight

296
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,083
until he rescued our lunch.

297
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,791
I bet he'll be back any minute.

298
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,500
All right, I just have to be
patient for a little bit longer.

299
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:37,208
I can't stand it! I'll
save you, Miharu!

300
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:41,750
Dammit! Stop
tying me to things!

301
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,541
No way, it's not your job.

302
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,250
Let Yukinari be her
knight in shining armor.

303
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,791
He's earned it.

304
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,708
You saw it yourself.

305
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,750
Weak little
Yukinari tried so hard

306
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:57,000
to get Miharu's bento
away from you.

307
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:01,541
He didn't have a chance
in the world, but he tried.

308
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:08,750
Kirie, do you have a cell phone?

309
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,875
Thanks to a certain
over-zealous someone,

310
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,333
mine doesn't work anymore.

311
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,208
Yeah I have one. What for?

312
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,291
Her knight in shining
armor needs some help.

313
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:26,416
Miharu! Miharu!

314
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,166
Where could she have gone?

315
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,041
I don't know where else
to look for you, Miharu.

316
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,291
Huh?

317
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,208
A restricted number?

318
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,666
Hello?

319
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,916
Have you tried looking for
her in the park, you retard?

320
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,708
What? Hello? Hello?

321
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,916
Miharu!

322
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,500
Huh?

323
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,416
Yukinari!

324
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,250
Yukinari!

325
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,958
Miharu!

326
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:26,458
Other people's happiness
is no fun. I'm leaving.

327
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,208
Wait! Hey, Fukuyama.

328
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,500
Now what?

329
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:31,833
Why'd you do that,

330
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,541
after you spent all day
trying to ruin their date?

331
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:39,291
I don't really know.

332
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,958
What? Is something amusing?

333
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,416
Oh, nothing.

334
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,041
You're laughing at nothing?

335
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,083
What? Tell me already!

336
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:26,875
You take the caps off

337
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,750
and recycle plastic bottles
with the non-burning trash.

338
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:32,250
Miharu, you learned how
to separate the trash?

339
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:36,125
Yes, if we all do our part,
the town stays nice and clean.

340
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,458
You're right.
I should pitch in too.

341
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,791
The insides of
bananas are really tasty.

342
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,958
But what about
the peels, Kirie?

343
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:46,833
Girls Bravo Season Two,
next episode, "Clean Up Bravo!"

344
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:48,166
Should be neat.

345
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,916
Is a banana peel inedible trash
if I just ate it?
