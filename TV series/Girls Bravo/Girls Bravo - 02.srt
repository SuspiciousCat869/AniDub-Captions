Come on, Yukinari.

Let's take a nice

Stop! I told you,
if I don't hurry up,

I'm not going to make
it to class on time!

Taking a bath is more
important than going to school.

Uh, Kirie?

00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,125
Good morning, there.

Oh, do you wanna
take a bath, too?

27

No, Kirie, w-w-w-w-wait.
This isn't what you think!

Sorry.

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,791
[YUKINARI] I think it
stinks how you always

32
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,916
punch first and
ask questions later.

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,583
Well, it looked
really bad!

34
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,458
Sorry.

35
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,208
As far as she's
concerned...

36
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:50,041
She really
puts it away.

No kidding!

00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,916
[YUKINARI] Miharu accidentally
came to Earth not too long ago,

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
from her home planet, Seiren,

40
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:01,125
a world filled almost
totally with women.

41
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,333
Since then, we've tried
sending her back

42
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,958
a bunch of different ways,

43
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,291
but no luck so far.

44
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,958
For now, at least,
she's staying at my house.

[MIHARU]
Yukinari!

00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,500
Huh?

47
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,500
This is really tasty!
I was wondering what it is.

48
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,791
[KIRIE]
The thin pieces?

49
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,666
They're called bread.

50
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,833
Do you like it?

51
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,750
Yeah!

52
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:28,416
Kirie understands the...
unique situation with Miharu.

53
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,750
So they don't have any bread
on the planet that you're from?

54
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,166
Now she actually
helps me out with her.

55
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,375
Nuh-uh, but we do have

56
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,666
a similar kind of food
that we call "pana."

57
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,333
For her part, Miharu doesn't
seem too homesick for Seiren...

58
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,833
"Pana"?

59
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,083
...which is good, because we
don't know how to get her there.

60
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,833
I guess that's
a good thing.

00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:43,916

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,708
Thank you!
That food is wonderful!

00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:50,583
It's so soft and tasty.

64
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,916
You like bread
that much?

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,375
Yeah. I like that
curry rice from yesterday, too.

66
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:59,291
But I think the bread I ate
right now is even better.

67

Okay then.
Hey, I know!

68
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,166
I'll bring back
some bread for you

when I come home
from school today.

From school?

71
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,250
So you can buy
bread where you learn?

72

Uh-huh! The school bread almost
makes it worth having to go.

The school bread...

74

There are a lot
of different types,

75
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,541
but the best is the bread
with the curry inside.

love to try some.

Well, it's not
that I can't.

But the school curry bread
is the most popular one!

Sorry, Miharu,
we have to go,

but don't you worry!

96
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,791
I'll get that
curry bread for you.

Oh yeah, there are
snacks in the cupboard.

98

Help yourself
if you get hungry.

99
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,541
I'll see you later.

100
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,833
I'm so hungry.

101
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:37,500
Bread. School bread.

102
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,666
It must be like silk.

Spicy curry wrapped inside
all that doughy goodness.

104

it fills the mouth

with warmth and
leaves you ecstatic!

That's it!

108
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,083
If I buy the school
bread for myself,

109
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,583
I don't have to
wait for Yukinari,

110
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,458
and that means
I get to go outside.

I'm outside on
a beautiful day!

I get to Yukinari's school.

Uh, you've never
seen a banana before?

It's a banana?

121
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,375
It's a banana.

122
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,125
So, it's a banana.

123
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,125
Yeah, it's
a banana.

124
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,000
Is it different
than curry bread?

125
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,041
It is very different
than curry bread.

126
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,958
That's what I thought.

127
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,625
Yeah, they're
the sale item for today.

128
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,708
Are they going
to sell out?

129
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,541
Well, the demand for
bananas has been down lately.

130
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,000
People just don't eat 'em
as much as they used to.

00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,333
Oh, I'm sorry.

132
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,958
Yeah, in the old days,

133
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,916
bananas were
a pretty ritzy fruit...

134
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,333
really hard to come by.

135

Imported fruit!
Fit for a king!

136

Wow, fit for a king!
That's really incredible.

137
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,208
[VENDOR laughs]
Wanna try one?

138
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,375
Is it okay?

139
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,833
Sure.

140
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,916
Dig in.

141
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,083
You like it?

142
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,708
Yes! Thank you,
it's good!

143
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,208
It's really
soft and very sweet!

144
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,416
It is, isn't it?

145
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,708
I can remember the very first
banana that I ever tasted.

146
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,125
Heh, changed my life forever.

147
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,916
I was a boy of fifteen.

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,458
I was in bed with
a bad case of the measles,

149
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,583
and my mother,
poor woman that she was,

150
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,208
went without to buy me bananas.

151
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,166
She fed me those bananas
with her own chapped hands

152
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,166
with such devotion it
made me want to weep

153
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,583
tears of gratitude flowed down
my young face like a river,

154
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,458
as I kept saying,
"It's good. It's good."

155
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,625
There and then, I vowed
that I would someday

156
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,666
open my own
produce store.

157
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,791
Taiwan, China,
the Philippines, Ecuador!

158
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,500
I sailed the world over
chasing a dream.

159
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,291
I can remember how many
times I almost perished at sea,

160
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:23,250
but it was all worth it when
I finally found the very best

161
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,291

00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,791
And the third
floor girl's bathroom.

320
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,208
Oh, I see.

321
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,166
[GIRLS scream]

322
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,333
[FUKUYAMA panting] The second
floor girl's bathroom.

323
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,208
Is that so?

324
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,666
[GIRLS scream]

325
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,250
[FUKUYAMA panting]

326
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:14,000
And last, but not least,
the faculty women's bathroom.

327
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,666
[LADY] Hey!
No men allowed, sonny! Hmph!

328
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,041
Thank you very much

329
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,583
for showing me all
of these bathrooms.

330
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:25,208
But if you don't mind,
could you maybe carry me

331
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,750
back to where
Yukinari is waiting for me?

332
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:33,041
Be patient, my sweet, we have
one more stop on our itinerary.

333
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,916
The grand climax of the Mizuno
High School tour, you might say.

334
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,791
You'll love it.

335
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,041
Oh.

336
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,166
Who is this
person anyway?

337
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,333
Let us go, now, to
Mizuno High School's

338
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,625
Secret Garden of
Earthly Delights!

339
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,750
Miharu!

340
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,458
Miharu?

341
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,083
Hey, Yukinari,
any luck over there?

342
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,125
Uh-unh. She's just gone.

343
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,625
Damn that Fukuyama!

344
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,916
Where's that
pervert hiding?!

345
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,416
This very moment,
Miharu might be...

346
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,750
with Fukuyama...

347
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,583
[MIHARI] Oh, no,
but I... I don't...

348
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,791
There's nothing to
be afraid of, Miharu.

349
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:17,708
Let us become Mizuno
High School's Adam and Eve.

350
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:19,458
Behold!

351
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh, no!

352
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,416
Ah, what good does it do

353
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,916
getting yourself all
depressed like that?!

354
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,416
But, Kirie.

355
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,041
Oh, just give it a rest.
You've always been that way.

356
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,375
You give up
without even trying,

357
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,791
and then you act
like a hermit.

358
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:36,791
You mope, and you're clumsy.
God you're clumsy.

359
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,708
But you're good to people,
and you do try.

360
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,000
Huh?

361
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:45,208
All of that stuff I said
back in the classroom...

362
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,916
all the good things
that I said about you...

363
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,375
I meant them.

364
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,750
Kirie?

365
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:57,166
That's why...
you should have...

366
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:03,125
you know...
more faith in yourself!

367
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,625
[YUKINARI] That was--
[FUKUYAMA laughing maniacally]

368
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,958
Yukinari!

369
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,333
Mi-Miharu!

370
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,708
Yukinari, wait!

371
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:16,708
Ah, man, and right when we
were at the good part, too.

372
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,166
Stop, Fukuyama!

373
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh, don't waste
your breath, Puny-nari.

374
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,375
You know you can't
possibly catch me!

375
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,291
Dammit, I'm not giving up!

376
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,208
I'm going to get Miharu back!

377
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:31,166
[FUKUYAMA laughing]
If you can, that is!

378
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,000
Um, excuse me, but
I should get back to Yukinari.

379
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:38,333
Don't be silly, Miharu,
we've reached our destination.

380
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,708
Okay.

381
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,208
[YUKINARI panting]
She... must be... in there. 

382
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,291
No! Yukinari!
Don't open that door!

383
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,583
Oh! My! God!

384
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:09,750
[ALL GIRLS] 
Peeping tom!

385
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,583
[KIRIE sighs]

386
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:16,000
Um, excuse me.
Will you stop beating him up?

387
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,625
I said "Stop it!"

388
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,625
Puny-nari had it coming.

389
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:20,833
Fukuyama!

390
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,750
Anybody who'd peep
at these sweet young things

391
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,458
is an enemy
to womanhood.

392
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,333
You're one to talk.

393
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,791
Yukinari!
Yukinari! Yukinari!

394
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,416
Sorry, but Miharu's
coming with me!

395
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,875
Fukuyama!

396
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,875
Kirie!

397
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:39,625
What a baby.

398
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,208
Yukinari! Yukinar--!

399
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,708
Just forget about him.

400
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,208
Leave that runt behind,

401
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,250
and spend every day with me
in my perverted wonderland.

402
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,166
What do you say?

403
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,208
[FUKUYAMA laughing]

404
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:22,833
What just... happened?

405
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:27,958
Fukuyama!

406
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,875
Kirie, wait a minute!

407
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,750
Sorry. I got carried away.

408
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,875
I'm sorry. Sorry. Okay? Okay?

409
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,458
Go apologize...

410
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,708
in Hell!

411
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,291
What was that?!

412
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,083
First an explosion, and now...

413
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,750
He looks hurt, fellas.

414
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,125
Hey, he's waking up.

415
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:59,500
Are you okay?

416
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:04,666
Peeping tom!

417
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:09,833
There it is... his secret.

418
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:13,291
Exactly the opposite
of Yukinari...

419
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:17,041
an allergy... to men.

420
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,875
I'm really sorry.
Because of me, you got beat up.

421
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:25,583
Don't worry about it.
Really, that wasn't your fault.

422
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,416
If I never came to school...

423
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,166
I should have just stayed
at home like you told me

424
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,875
to do in the first place.

425
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,625
Miharu...

426
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,083
Still, I'm sorry.

427
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,041
I'm telling you I'm fine.

428
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,875
Sure I'm not very big,
but I'm tougher than I look.

429
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,375
Yukinari!

430
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:47,000
Oh yeah, I got you
some school bread.

431
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:51,375
Oh... I'm sorry
it got all burnt up.

432
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:54,708
I'll buy you another
one tomorrow, 'kay?

433
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:04,791
This is very tasty...
Yukinari's curry bread!
