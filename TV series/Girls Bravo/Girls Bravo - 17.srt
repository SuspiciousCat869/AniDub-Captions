00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:02,833
[MIHARU]
You're lucky, Koyomi,

2
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,916
your skin is
really smooth.

3
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,416
[KOYOMI]
Um, I guess so.

4
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,833
I envy you Miharu.

5
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,833
You eat what you
want and stay skinny.

6
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:13,541
And you're a lot curvier,
you know... on top.

7
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:17,125
But why? I think that
you're beautiful, Koyomi!

8
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,000
--Look at you!
--Hey! Stop it, Miharu!

9
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,583
That tickles.

10
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,625
[MIHARU and KOYOMI laughing]

12

[MIHARU sneezes]
[bathtub explodes]

13
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,208
[KOYOMI]
Ah! The bathtub!

14
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,333
[MIHARU] Oh, no.
What are we going to do?

15
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,375
[TOMO] Wake up already!

16
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,000
It's Sunday, Tomoka.

17
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,041
Good night.

18
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,416
Come on! It's practically
six in the morning!

19
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,416
Get up!

20
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,958
Okay, okay, I'll get up.

21
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,208
What do you want?

22
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,041
Miharu and Koyo
went out somewhere

23
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,583
and didn't even
invite me along.

24
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,500
Huh?

25
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,750
Well good morning, Kirie.

26
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,166
Morning you two.

27
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,583
So, did anyone
see you sneak out?

28
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:25,916
I guess not.

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,083
[TOMO] I don't believe it!

30
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,083
Kirie gets to go
with them, and I don't?

31
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,250
How come nobody
invited Tomo? Huh?

32
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,291
[YUKINARI yawns]

33
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,916
Maybe some store's
having an early bird sale.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,458
Maybe Tomo wanted
to go shopping, too!

35
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:43,625
It's not nice to leave me
behind like some little kid!

36
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,375
They're on the move!

37
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,791
Come on, hurry up
and get dressed

38
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,458
so we can follow them.

39
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,250
[YUKINARI sighs]
You're kidding, right?

40
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,791
[YUKINARI] We've been
riding for a long time.

41
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,333
I wonder where they're heading.

42
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,541
[TOMO] Hey! Get a load of that!

43
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,625
An amusement park.

44
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,916
But why wouldn't
they take you along?

45
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,875
[TOMO growls]
It's not fair! It's not fair!

46
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,000
I can't believe
they'd go to a theme park

47
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,375
and leave me at home!

48
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,375
Hold on, they're not
getting off of the train.

49
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,583
[TOMO] Hmm. So where are
they sneaking off to, huh?

50
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,791
Huh?

51
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,000
Who are all these guys?

52
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,458
I mean, I feel like we just took

53
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,833
the train to Nerdville.

54
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,333
Maybe there's
some kind of big event

55
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,875
happening around here today.

56
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,083
Big event, huh?

57
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,333
Something boring
or something fun?

58
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,208
Hey! Over there!

59
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,458
Tokyo Game Carnival?
What's that?

60
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:05,166
It's where they announce
the new video games every year.

61
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,208
Well, Tomo is not amused.

62
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,500
I'm way better at video
games than the three of them!

63
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,000
We're going in there!

64
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,333
Nya nya!

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,916
Hey, wait up, Tomoka!

66
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,083
That line to get inside was
a lot longer than I thought.

67
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,041
Nya!

68
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,458
No way! That looks like Poyon!

69
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,875
Hey, Tomoka! That's not...

70
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,833
I'm your biggest
fan in the world!

71
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,375
[COSPLAYER] Hi! I'm Poyon.

72
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,875
Wh-Wh-Wh-What?

73
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,500
Why didn't
anyone tell me Poyon

74
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,833
was some fat guy in drag
who smelled like wet feet?

75
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,375
Don't freak out now, Tomoka.

76
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,291
He's just cosplaying.

77
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,708
[TOMO growling]

78
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:51,666
Nya?

79
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,416
I don't care
what you call it!

80
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,250
This loser has no right
to be dressing up like Poyon!

81
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,250
But my costume's so accurate.

82
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,916
This isn't over, freak.

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,750
If you don't want to
see me beating this weirdo

84
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,750
within an inch of his life,
you better look away now!

85
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,250
Hey, calm down, Tomoka!

86
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:14,416
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you all right, miss?

87
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,416
That was weird.
That girl...

88
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,666
[GUARD] Hey you!

89
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,875
This is bad. Tomoka!

90
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,041
I'm not scared of you!

91
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,333
I'll take you all on at once!

92
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,333
[YUKINARI and TOMO panting]

93
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,708
Are you happy now?

94
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:39,791
I'll show 'em!

95
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,500
I'll vaporize
them with the E-Beam,

96
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,125
and that fake Poyon too!

97
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,250
No way. Please, just
try to behave, okay?

98
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,291
Yukinari, this way!

99
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,000
Huh? Miharu?

100
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,791
I've been looking
all over for you.

101
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,375
[YUKINA] That's him?

102
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,333
Yes.

103
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,958
Explain yourselves!
You better have a good excuse,

104
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,750
or you'll be hearing
from my lawyer!

105
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,875
Tomoka, you don't
have a lawyer.

106
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,291
So guys, why are you here?

107
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,125
You see,
what happened was...

108
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:16,375
I sort of broke
the bathtub last night,

109
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,500
so I wanted to make
some money to repair it.

110
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,166
I told Kirie what happened,

111
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,875
and so she set us up
with this part-time job.

112
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:27,083
Yeah, our official
title is "Eye-candy."

113
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,833
So that's...

114
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,750
...why you're
dressed like that?

115
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,875
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:37,625
No, it's okay.
You look good.

117
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,125
But...
it doesn't matter now.

118
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,083
But why not?

119
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,708
We're in trouble, Yukinari.

120
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,416
One more girl was supposed
to show up this morning,

121
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,750
but she flaked out
at the last minute.

122
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:51,750
And it's too late now to try
and find a replacement for her.

123
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,583
Oh what do I do?

124
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,291
I don't know.

125
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,541
Me neither.

126
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,000
I know it's totally unfair

127
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,500
to spring this on you
at the last minute, but...

128
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:04,375
Um, you wanna
fill in for her?

129
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,791
Say what?

130
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,250
Yeah, she was gonna be
our emcee, and you can do that.

131
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,333
It'll be easy.

132
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,375
So, whattya say?

133
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,750
Kirie, I get dizzy

134
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,875
just standing up
to give a book report!

135
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,083
You can do it, Yukinari!

136
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,541
Everything is written down.

137
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,708
All you need to do is
read straight from the script.

138
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,208
It's the easiest
money you'll ever make!

139
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,500
Talking in front of people
makes me wanna throw up.

140
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,875
Wait, what did you say?

141
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,208
Huh?

142
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,583
Please, just say it
for me one more time.

143
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,916
Talking in front of people
makes me wanna barf?

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,833
Perfect.

145
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:34,833
What?

146
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,416
Your voice is just perfect!

147
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,208
Perfect? Really?

148
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,375
Forgive me, Yukinari...

149
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,083
Oh how stupid I've been
not to realize it...

150
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,916
I can't believe
I've never noticed until now

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
what a beautiful
voice you have.

152
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,750
Right, Miharu?

153
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,750
Yes! Yukinari's voice
is really pretty!

154
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,458
It's so soothing yet clear,

155
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,708
the sort of voice
that rejuvenates

156
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,250
anyone lucky
enough to hear it.

157
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:01,208
Your vocal chords are a blessing
from the heavens above!

158
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,250
That's right!

159
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah? You think so?

160
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,708
But Kirie...
don't we need a girl?

161
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,250
The best voice in the world!

162
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,916
It's marvelous!

I said just one!

325
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,458
I-I wonder what all those men

326
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,416
by the stage
are yelling about...

327
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,166
I think they're
about to play a game!

328
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,666
Do your best!

329
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,166
Good luck Yukinari--
I mean Yukina!

330
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,208
Hey Big Brother Kazuharu!
Don't lose, okay?

331
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,208
I know you're all
anxious to find out

332
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,375
whether or not Yukina will
be sleeping alone tonight!

333
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,708
It's time to
reveal our first game!

334
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,875
Exciting bike!

335
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,333
It's a racing simulator.

336
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,333
Whoever can do
3 laps around the course

337
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,375
in the shortest
time wins the round!

Do your best Yukinari!

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,458
Yeah, thanks.

00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:46,041
Hold on, what do you think
you're doing back there?

344
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,875
This is a 2-person
bike, my dear.

All of our games
are specially designed

Oh, no! I'm falling off.

352
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,625
I'd better hold on tighter.

Yukina!
Don't tell me you're...

Game over, man, game over.

You're busted!

Everyone!

00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,625
Yukina's
definiely an 'A' cup!

365
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,750
She said I just had
to read the script.

366
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,666
Oh, you are
just so scrumptious.

367
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,208
[KIRIE] Yukina's time was
3 minutes and 10 seconds.

368
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,041
Fukuyama's time was
2 minutes and 55 seconds.

All right!
Fukuyama is the winner!

Oh poor Yukina,
can she win the next 2 rounds?

371
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,541
Or will Fukuyama
win the tournament

372
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,125
and finish the day on top?

373
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,916
On top of her that is!

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,541
Wah. This sucks.

The all new Prance

There's nothing to it,

all you have to do
is keep touching

whatever color paddles
come up on the screen.

If it's so easy, why do I
have a bad feeling about this?

00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,208
Okay.

Wait until
we're home, okay?

Ahh!

Oh no, I guess I lost.

394
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,125
But don't
think you'll beat me

395
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,250
that easily
in the last game.

396

[FUKUYAMA laughs]
[YUKINARI] You lost on purpose!

And now, last but not least,
Sleep Fighters Omega!

398
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,208
Sure, it may look like just
another generic fighting title,

399
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,416
but it uses cutting edge
technology to scan the players

400
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,375
and import them as
their game characters.

401

Good luck Yukina!
I know you can beat him again!

This game is gonna rock!

403
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:35,833
Yukina's fate depends on
the outcome of this final round!

Take your gloves off in Hell!

[KIRIE] Yukina's talking
a lot of trash,

409
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,916
but can she finish him off?

410
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,875
Hey, how come you're
not fighting back, huh?

411
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,708
I just can't
bear to hurt you.

Even if it is only your
character in some video game.

Huh? What do you mean?

414
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:16,125
So I'm going to finish you
off... quick and painless.

Huh?

my Hundred-handed Strip Attack!

[YUKINARI screams]

418
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:27,416
Oh man! Fukuyama's
technique is dynamite!

419

Right on,

424
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:47,750
Amazing! But I think
Yukina did a very good job also.

425
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,416
That was some
great playing, Fukuyama!

426
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,666
Come on up and claim your prize.

hurts the first time.

00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,416
Get off!

430
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,916
Hmm? There's something...

431
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,291
...in my hand
that shouldn't be.

432
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,708
That's a...

433
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:14,708
That's right, it's
exactly what you thought.

434
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,833
And now you can
get the tub fixed up!

435
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:33,416
Lucky me.
I hope you're happy.

436
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,833
Fukuyama got to third base.

437
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,500
It was really fun!

438
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,125
There were so many
different games!

439
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,208
Nya! Nya!

440
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:45,041
Uh-huh! And Yukina
was really cute.

441
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,291
Yeah, a little too cute.

442
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,500
I love a good
game of Mah-Jong.

I've never seen
tiles like these.

444

Well I have made
a few changes to it.

445

A few changes, huh?

446
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:34,666
I don't know...

447
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,500
I think you'll
like it, Puny-nari.

448
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,208
If the girls lose, they have
to take their clothes off.

449
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:41,125
Well, what do you say?

450

00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:49,916
Wow! Fukuyama,
you have really good tiles!
