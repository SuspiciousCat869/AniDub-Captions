You...

I saw you on Earth.

You're behind all this?

Why did you take her?

Nevermind. Just give Miharu back

I'm okay.
Remember what I told you.

Sure I'm small, but I'm actually
a lot stronger than I look.

I'm sorry, but I really don't
like it when people yell at me.

Why are you doing this to her?

195

My name is Yukina.

It's all over my body...

The star mark, that's right.

00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:47,625
It's both my blessing
and my curse.

But... what's that have
to do with Miharu?

You're... allergic.

It's funny, isn't it?

210

This rash, I get it every
time I touch a man.

211
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,375
That's why I decided...

212
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:14,250
if I could never enjoy
a man's embrace,

213
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:21,083
then no one else on Seiren
should get to enjoy one either.

Your fighting skills
are top notch.

Never you mind.

I'll tell you what she's doing!

222
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,083
She's been
following Miharu around

223

ever since she
was a little girl.

Once Hijiri joined the
Space Management Bureau,

wouldn't have to suffer anymore.

No more star marks.
No more men appearing on Seiren.

I wouldn't have to be ashamed.

So, you finally give up.

Yeah! And it hurt!

Sometimes people hurt you,
but loneliness hurts worse.

I know, because I used
to be just like you.

and reach out to somebody
with your hands,

you'll meet

Right.

328
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,500
Yukki... you did it.

329
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:13,750
He's okay.

330
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,250
Yes. Everything is okay now.

331
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,125
They're all coming
back home to us.

332
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:29,333
You know... you're a damn idiot,
but you're my kind of idiot.

333
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:16,125
Oh, Yukinari! Rise and shine!
It's time for breakfast.

334
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,333
Today I made fresh
cooked rice and clam miso soup,

335
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:22,375
a Japanese style omelette,
and baked horse mackerel.

336
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,791
I hope you're hungry,
sleepyhead.

337
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,500
Huh? Yukinari?

338
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,000
Miharu?

339
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,000
Yukinari!

340
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:37,333
Ah, Miharu... good morning.

341
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,833
You know better
than that, Yukina.

342
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,916
You're both going
to end up all itchy.

343
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,375
Not me!

344
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,458
And that's because
Yukinari is the man

345
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,583
that I'm destined to be with.

346
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:51,250
After that first time I met him,
I haven't gotten one rash.

347
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,416
So you get cured and my
allergy comes right back.

348
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,750
Yeah, that seems
all kind of fair.

349
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,708
Please, just get
off him already.

350
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,250
Sorry, Yukinari.

351
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,208
Can I hide in here?

352
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,625
Uh, Kirie?

353
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,833
So here you are, Kirie.

354
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,500
When you slammed me
into the floor like that,

355
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,583
I suddenly realized you
were the perfect girl for me.

356
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:20,291
Hold on. I'm not sharing
Miss Kirie with anyone.

357
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,875
What are you talking about?

358
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,875
I've been harassing Kirie
for years now, she's mine!

359
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:29,125
Ms. Hijiri, it looks like she's
turned over a whole new leaf.

360
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:32,041
Ah, don't worry Yukinari,

361
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,083
my feelings for you
will never change.

362
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:43,416
They shouldn't be so noisy
this early... right, Daddy?

363
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:49,000
They're all just a bunch of
horny teenagers if you ask me.

364
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,041
NYA.

365
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,166
It would seem so.

366
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,625
You're wise beyond
your years, Tomoka.

367
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,500
Well, that's all right.

368
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,375
At least the gate
is staying open now.

369
00:22:57,458 --> 00:23:00,083
I can comb this
wonderful masculine planet

370
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:03,000
for the man of my dreams!

371
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,000
You know, you're pretty cute.

372
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,500
Wanna get married
later this afternoon?

373
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,083
Huh?

374
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:12,208
Aw geez. And I thought there
were too many girls here before.

375
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,916
[GIRLS] Yukinari!

376
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,916
Yeah, I'll be right down!

377
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,583
Huh?

378
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,125
Yukinari!

379
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,500
Coming!

380
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,916
My name is Yukinari Sasaki.

381
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,041
Girls have been picking on
me and bossing me around

382
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,083
ever since I was a little kid.

383
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:37,458
It got so bad I started breaking
out whenever they touched me.

384
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,416
You know what?

385
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,208
I still do, but it doesn't
really bother me anymore.

386
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,375
There was a time
I thought I hated 'em.

387
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:52,833
But I've had a change of heart.
I love girls! I really do!
