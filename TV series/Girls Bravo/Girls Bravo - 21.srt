1
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,666
Ah?

2
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,750
[YUKINARI] Yeah.
Don't worry, Dad.

3
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:17,250
I'm doing just fine.

4
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,291
You know, Mom says you've
been working too hard lately.

5
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,083
Try to relax a bit, okay?

6
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:25,000
I mean, you don't
wanna burn yourself out.

7
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:29,958
Yeah. I miss you too, Dad.

8
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,458
Daddy, where are you?

9
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,875
"Eye on Mizuno."

10
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,583
If you love delicious
fruits and vegetables,

11
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,000
and who doesn't?

12
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,625
You don't want
to touch that dial.

13
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,041
This week we
focus on Mr. Yaoshichi,

14
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,208
a local grocer whose ripe,
luscious produce

15
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,625
leaves his competitors,

16
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,958
and their veggies,
green with envy.

17
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,583
You'll find him
in the shopping arcade

18
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,291
near the train station.

19
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,375
And here he is!

20
00:02:59,458 --> 00:02:59,791
Thank you for
speaking to us today.

21
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:00,583
Thanks!

22
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,666
Do you wanna buy bananas?

23
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,916
Then come to
the banana man!

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,166
I got 'em all!

25
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,333
You know what?

26
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:09,166
This is the best cake
I've had all day.

27
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,625
It's the only
cake you've had.

28
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,791
That's what you think.

29
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,125
[MIHARU and YUKINARI laughing]

30
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,166
Hey, Miharu?

31
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,291
What's up with those
dots on your forehead?

32
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:25,291
I mean, is that
a birthmark or tattoo or what?

33
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,791
All I know is when they glow,
better run for it!

34
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,125
You know, I'm not sure.

35
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:34,416
What do you mean?

36
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,666
It's on your head,
isn't it?

37
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,250
Yeah, but those dots
have been up there

38
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,666
ever since
I was a little girl.

39
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,000
You know,
I guess I never really

40
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,208
gave it any thought, Kirie.

41
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,791
I don't remember Maharu

42
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,125
having one of those
when she visited.

43
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,041
Observe!

44
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,583
Tomo's forehead
is zit-free.

45
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,916
Nya!

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,041
Maybe there's something
special about those dots.

47
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,208
I wonder...

48
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,416
Special how?

49
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,833
I've got it!

50
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,708
If Miharu's
special zits disappear,

51
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:05,375
she'll start acting
like a whole other person.

52
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,666
No way.

53
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,500
Interesting.

54
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:20,166
Without dots, maybe
she'd act... like this...

55
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:20,875
Wah!

56
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,708
Ah!

57
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,541
No! Spying on me
in the bathroom!

58
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,833
You're such a pervert!

59
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,833
No! It's not like that!
I swear it!

60
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,000
Save your excuses, dumbass.

61
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,916
Stare at naked girls in Hell!

62
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,750
Hey, if we get rid of
that mark on her forehead,

63
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,791
maybe Miharu
won't flounce around

64
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,708
like a chuckleheaded nudist!

65
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,541
Huh? But why is her
beating me up a good thing?

66
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,458
There's no knowing
what she might do.

67
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,666
Think of it.

68
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,208
Nya.

69
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,750
Here! Bon appetit!

70
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,208
Have as much
as you want.

71
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,583
Hey, thanks Miharu.

72
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,833
It's great!

73
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:03,166
What did you...
put in my food?

74
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,458
Voila!

75
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,166
But... why,
Miharu, why?

76
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,125
I don't know.

77
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,541
It just seemed
like a good idea.

78
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,291
What kind of
reason is that?

79
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,500
Farewell, Yukinari.

80
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,791
Guess you won't
be having seconds.

81
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,666
Once we get rid of
those zits on her forehead,

82
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,416
no more Little Miss
Goody-Goody Two Shoes.

83
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,708
No! I would never
poison Yukinari!

84
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,250
Are you two mad
at me or something?

85
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,458
Maybe nothing will happen.

86
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,916
But there's only one
way to know for sure.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,416
Huh? Um...
What are you doing?

88
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,791
No! Stop touching me there!

89
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,958
What's going on?

90
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,250
So, how do
you feel, Miharu?

91
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,458
Like kicking ass
and taking names?

92
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,166
Are you evil yet, or what?

93
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,625
I don't have all day.

94
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,625
The two of you
aren't very nice.

95
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,833
It's okay, Miharu.

96
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,875
Let's get you
cleaned up, all right?

97
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,458
There's just
no pleasing some people.

98
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,000
That was dumb.

99
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,500
And people wonder
why girls give me a rash.

100
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,666
The mark on
her forehead?

101
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,875
That's right, Koyo!

102
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,458
But you don't
have one either!

103
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,375
No, I don't have it,

104
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,250
but my mother
back on Seiren

105
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,041
has one on her head, too.

106
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,041
Wow, your mom's
pretty cool.

107
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,791
Hey, in that case,

108
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,458
do you know
anything about them?

109
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:23,333
Uh, not really.
I mean...

110
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,916
Now let's see what
his customers have to say!

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,041
Ma'am, do you come to
Yaoshichi's shop very often?

112
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,333
[SHOPPER] Oh, yes.

113
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,083
His produce has always
been very fresh. Ahh!

114
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,458
Especially the bananas!

115
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,875
Our bananas are the best!

116
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,333
Ah! That's him!

117
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,458
Huh?

118
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,833
Koyomi?

119
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,291
What's up with Koyo?

120
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:02,666
That man.
He looked like...

121
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,375
...my father.

122
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,541
Hey Mommy?

123
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,916
Hmm?

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,666
Where did Daddy go?

125
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,708
To a faraway place.

126
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,375
A faraway place?

127
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,208
Father went
back to his home.

128
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,625
Uh?

129
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,375
He went up there.

130
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,500
Back to his
home on Earth.

131
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,125
Do you understand?

132
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:33,250
But... he'll
come back, right?

133
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:37,250
When do I get
to see my daddy?

134
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,750
Koyomi?

135
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,250
Huh?

136
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,541
Tell me what you see.

137
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,250
There's something
on your head.

138
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,166
That's right,
without this mark,

139
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,000
I never would have met
your father and married him.

140
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,875
But what
does it do, Mommy?

141
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:57,416
Well, whoever bears
this mark on her forehead

142
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,333
has somebody waiting for
her in a place far, far away.

143
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,458
This mark is
the key, Koyomi.

144
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:07,166
It opens a door
to that faraway place,

145
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,750
so they can be together.

146
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,583
It's called the star mark.

147
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,458
Star mark?

148
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:17,666
But... my star mark
won't shine anymore.

149
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,791
The door will
never open again.

150
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll never see him again.

151
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:31,625
I'm sorry...
I'm so sorry, Koyomi.

152
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,125
Mommy!

153
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,166
Well, how's she
doing in there?

154
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,875
Dunno. She still
looks pretty depressed.

155
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,458
Hey, come on guys.

156
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,208
You shouldn't
spy on people.

157
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,583
It's not nice.

158
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,541
Shh, she's gonna hear you.

159
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,500
Poor Koyomi.
What's the matter?

160
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,083
How come she got
so upset, anyway?

161
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,625
Yeah. Something must
have happened to her.

162
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,750
But what?

163
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,708
All right.

164
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,500
Dammit, she's coming out!

165
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,750
Quick, everybody
let's hide in my room.

166
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,250
Right!

167
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,000
What? Hmm? Huh?

168
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,250
We made it.

169
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,375
Hold on, where's Tomoka?

170
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,458
Oh, why are you just
standing out here, Tomoka?

171
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,541
I-I'm field testing
my latest invention.

172
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:22,500
Yeah, that's it.

173
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,166
I call it
the Ebi-Clean 2,000.

174
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,625
Nyuh.

175
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,625
It's a mop, it's a pet,
it's a skateboard.

176
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:31,791
We can mass produce them

177
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:32,500
and get filthy rich, Koyo.

178
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,291
Nyo.

179
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,125
So, feel like getting
in on the ground floor?

180
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,625
Uh, no thanks.

181
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,500
Actually,
I have to go down

182
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,000
to the shopping
arcade for a while.

183
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,500
Husband hunting for Maharu?

184
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,791
Good idea, Koyo.
I'll come too.

185
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,333
Um, I think
I'll just go alone.

186
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,541
See ya later, Tomoka.

187
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:51,791
Oh.

188
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:03,208
I'm sorry about earlier.
Please forgive me.

189
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:07,083
Hmm.
Well, all right then.

190
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,958
But I'm only gonna
let it slide this one time.

191
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,291
Nya!

192
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,375
Here, Ebi, help me
eat all this ice cream.

193
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,083
Nya!

194
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,166
Why would Koyomi leave
her behind like that?

195
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,208
Yeah.

196
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,375
I don't know.

197
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,833
Something must
really be bothering her.

198
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,666
Excuse me,
I'm looking for this man.

199
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,208
Sorry, you haven't seen
the man in this photo, have you?

200
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,291
No, I don't know him.

201
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,541
Um, thank you very much.

202
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,958
Uh, hello?

203
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,416
Huh? Yeah?

204
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,375
Uh, d-d-do you know
the man in this photo?

205
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,791
Doesn't ring a bell.

206
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,625
So you're lookin'
for a man, huh?

207
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:51,833
Uh!

208
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,625
How 'bout we have
some fun, hot stuff?

209
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:58,083
Sorry I-I have to go!

210
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,208
I don't believe it.

211
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,333
Koyomi was talking
to some random guy.

212
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,875
Yeah. I guess that means

213
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,791
she's not scared
of men anymore.

214
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,875
Um, she did run
away screaming.

215
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:12,375
Well, shy little Koyomi
is talking to strange men

216
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,125
instead of worrying
that they're going to do

217
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,750
kinky things to her.

218
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,000
Well, she must be stuck

219
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,250
between a rock
and my hard place.

220
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,708
Fu-Fukuyama?

221
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:22,500
Nya!

222
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:23,666
It's Big Brother Kazuharu.

223
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,875
Here, Tomoka.
Nobody likes a dirty girl.

224
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,958
Thank you very much.

225
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,750
What are you doing here?

226
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't even
want to know, do I?

227
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,625
Calm down, Kirie.

228
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,333
We can help you figure out
what's wrong with Koyomi.

229
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,541
We're smart!

230
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:44,166
Oh yes, I'm really
worried about her, Lisa.

231
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,291
Me too.

232
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,916
If there's anything
we can do for her,

233
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,583
we have to give it a try.

234
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,666
Oh, my dear Yukinari!

235
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,791
You're so sweet.

236
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,000
I would love to help
you out with this.

237
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,666
Hey Lisa, you've got
something brown on your nose.

238
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,958
Our poor little Koyomi!

239
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,833
I had no idea!

240
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,708
It's the saddest
thing ever!

241
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,166
Oh, so that's it.

242
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,500
Koyomi was out
looking for her father.

243
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,666
[HAYATE] Yes.

244
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,083
However, none of
my sources were able

245
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,000
to provide me
with a name.

246
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,833
[KOSAME] Ooh, Miss Kirie!

247
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:23,000
Kirie... Oh Miss Kirie.
Ooh, Miss Kirie.

248
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,166
Don't worry, Miss.

249
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,166
I'll certainly do
my best to keep Kosame

250
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,166
from ravishing you today.

251
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,333
Gee thanks.

252
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,208
Oh yeah, Koyomi's
father was an Earthling.

253
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,583
I'd forgotten.

254
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,500
Huh? Are you
sure about that?

255
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:36,583
Uh-huh! She told me the same
evening she arrived here.

256
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,875
And you never
thought to share

257
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,416
that tidbit of
information until right now?

258
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,458
Well, I didn't
know until right now

259
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,416
that her father was
living here on Earth.

260
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,333
I just kind of assumed
he was back on Seiren.

261
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,250
That's neat.

262
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,541
Koyomi's parents
are just like

263
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,500
Yukinari and me,
aren't they?

264
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,291
Because I was
born on Seiren

265
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,708
and Yukinari
was born on Earth.

266
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,375
Oh, and Koyomi's mom

267
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,625
has something on
her forehead, too.

268
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,500
Just like me.

269
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:07,000
You both have the birthmark,
but what does it mean?

270
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,125
Let's get to work already!

271
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,250
Uh, Fukuyama?

272
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,875
Dry your tears, Tomoka.

273
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,208
This is no time
for maudlin sentiment.

274
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,083
We have to find
Koyomi's father.

275
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,125
With my brains and your...
something, we're unstoppable!

276
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:20,916
Nya!

277
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,041
Go!

278
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,958
Yeah, we'll check in
with the hospitals later.

279
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,333
But what now?

280
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,125
Since Koyomi was looking
for her father around here,

281
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,583
she must have
had some reason

282
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,000
to think this was
a good spot to do it.

283
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:37,000
Right! So we should
look around here for him.

284
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,375
I want Koyomi and her
father to be together.

285
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,708
Yeah, but she never
did tell any of us

286
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,375
about this
whole dad thing.

287
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,500
Maybe she kept it to
herself for a good reason.

288
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,875
Oh.

289
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,833
Maybe, but now that I know,
I can't just ignore it.

290
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,250
Me neither.

291
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,833
We gotta help
her out somehow.

292
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,416
Uh. Right!

293
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,166
Okay, if you won't
take no for an answer.

294
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:04,333
Has anybody seen
the man in this picture?

295
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,833
Excuse me, have
you seen this man?

296
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,583
Thank you very
much for your time.

297
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,333
Uh, sir, have
you ever seen this--

298
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,000
Sorry.

299
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:22,041
I'm fine. I can't give up.

300
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,375
Hello?

301
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,875
Have you... have
you seen this man?

302
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:31,333
He's my... he's my father.

303
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:47,500
I can't. I can't
do anything right.

304
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,250
I'm useless.

305
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,291
I can't even
find my own father.

306
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:55,583
I thought I could
find a husband for Maharu,

307
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:59,416
but I can't find anybody.

308
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,875
You don't have to
do it alone, Koyomi.

309
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:10,041
Huh? What are
you all doing here?

310
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,625
Come on, it's okay.

311
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,375
If there's any way
we can help out,

312
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,125
Koyomi, just let us know.

313
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,083
Yeah, you should have
said something before.

314
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,666
We could have
been helping you

315
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,666
look for him all
this time, silly.

316
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,291
Helping me look?

317
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,291
Here. You see?

318
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,375
You have great
parents, Koyomi.

319
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,250
You all seem so happy.

320
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,541
Um, sorry.

321
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,333
I don't mean to be nosey
about something personal

322
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,458
like your father
being missing, Koyomi,

323
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,916
but when I see
you working so hard,

324
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,500
I feel like
the least I can do

325
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,250
is try to
help you find him.

326
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,708
Miharu...

327
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,583
Oh please,
won't you let us all

328
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,708
help you find your father?

329
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,583
We wanna help.

330
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,250
Okay!

331
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,791
Sorry to bother you guys,

332
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:06,000
but... has anyone seen
the man in this photo?

333
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,583
We really have to find him.

334
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,250
My friend's
father is missing.

335
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:13,458
Does anybody recognize
the man in this photograph?

336
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,291
Asking around like that
is just a big waste of time.

337
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:21,583
I'll channel Mabanya's powers
and find him right away.

338
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,916
Lisa, what are you doing?!

339
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,500
Uh, excuse me.

340
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,041
Do you know
anything about this man?

341
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,833
Have any of you seen
the man in this photograph?

342
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:33,916
Anybody?

343
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,416
Excuse me,
do you know this man?

344
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,833
Have any of you
seen him before?

345
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:42,166
Everybody, we're
looking for Koyomi's dad.

346
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,708
Excuse me, ma'am,

347
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,333
have you seen
the man in this picture?

348
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,750
If you could
just take a look,

349
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,791
it'd be greatly appreciated.

350
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:49,958
He's about yea tall.

351
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:50,666
They're right.
I shouldn't just give up.

352
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,833
Excuse me, have
you seen this man?

353
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,958
What gives?

354
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,958
We didn't come up
with a single lead.

355
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:05,041
Yeah, and we were
out here all afternoon.

356
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,791
But we tried.

357
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,416
Hey, but don't
let it get you down,

358
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,375
we'll find him
next time for sure.

359
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,833
Yeah!
At least we know

360
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,750
he's somewhere
in this town, right?

361
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,333
Right! We'll look
around some more tomorrow.

362
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,833
So don't be sad,
okay Koyomi?

363
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,291
I'm all right.

364
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,416
Huh?

365
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,458
Really. I'm not
so upset anymore.

366
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,666
I really wish I could have
found my father on Earth,

367
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,458
but I did find a bunch
of wonderful friends

368
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,083
who care about me.

369
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:38,541
That's more
than enough for me.

370
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:45,000
Miharu's star mark helped
bring all of us together.

371
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,500
This isn't over!

372
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,416
That's right!

373
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:49,958
Big Brother!

374
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,416
And Tomoka's with him!

375
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,666
So, you're finally
done fooling around, huh?

376
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,041
Fooling around?
You wound me!

377
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,375
Yeah, Kirie.

378
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,333
Big Brother Kazuharu
and me spent all day

379
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,708
trying to help
Koyomi find her dad.

380
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,500
What? You were
looking, too?

381
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,416
Yes! Incompetent
though I may be,

382
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,416
I'll toil to my
last breath to reunite

383
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,541
the fair Koyomi
with her father.

384
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,125
Fukyuyama...

385
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,541
Big Brother Kazuharu,
it's showtime!

386
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,541
Oh, I see.
Then witness if you will...

387
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,125
...the power of my genius!

388
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:26,708
Huh? That's me.

389
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,416
Good evening,

390
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,208
we're interrupting
our regular programming

391
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,958
to bring you a special
exposé entitled

392
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,541
"Where is Koyomi's Father?"

393
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,500
We'll begin by interviewing

394
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:42,208
Kazuharu Fukuyama
and Tomoka Lana Jude,

395
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:42,708
No way.

396
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:43,541
Way.

397
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,750
who are kind enough to bring

398
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,708
this tale of woe
to our attention.

399
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,875
Hello.

400
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:47,875
Greetings, TV Land.

401
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,541
Now, what can
you share with us

402
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,416
about this
sad situation?

403
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,916
I-I'm sorry,

404
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,750
I promised myself
I wouldn't cry,

405
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,083
but... imagine
a father and daughter

406
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,083
living worlds apart!

407
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,291
She came to Earth
forsaking all she knew

408
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,375
to try and find him!

409
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:10,791
Hey Koyo's dad,
if you're watching this,

410
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,791
come down to the station.

411
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:13,583
Nya!

412
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:14,916
What do you think?

413
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,208
We took our idea to
the Mizuno Cable TV station

414
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,916
and spent the rest of
the afternoon taping it.

415
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,083
Finding Koyo's dad after
this is gonna be a cinch!

416
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:23,791
Nya nya!

417
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,416
That wasn't so bad.

418
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,958
And one more thing.

419
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,750
This is Koyomi!

420
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:35,125
Her measurements
are 80, 50, and 78.

421
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,041
Her breasts are a
little on the small side,

422
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:41,416
but she really makes
the most of what she's got.

423
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
She's got a huge heart
under those little boobs.

424
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:47,125
But her hips are
a different story.

425
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:51,333
Yes, curvy and splendid.
And so smooth and supple.

426
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,458
They're the hips
of a seductress.

427
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,375
Yeah, Koyo's hips make up
for her little boobs.

428
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,875
Look! Koyomi's father!

429
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,458
Feast your eyes on her.

430
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,291
The gorgeous
fruit of your loins.

431
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,041
She's hot.

432
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,125
Please come forward.

433
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,166
Uh-huh.

434
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,083
Your smokin' hot
daughter misses you.

435
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,375
Who's your daddy?

436
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,666
There's a big cash
reward if you come forward!

437
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,958
Tomoka's right,
I'm filthy rich.

438
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,583
Money hand over fist.
I'll even reward you to find

439
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,458
Koyomi's father for us!

440
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,833
If you have any information,

441
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,750
call our 24-hour hotline
at the Mizuno Cable station.

442
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,083
Just look at her!

443
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,208
Operators are
standing by. Call now!

444
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,541
Fukuyama!
What the hell is this?

445
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,833
Genius, isn't it?

446
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,333
Wouldn't any
absent father wonder

447
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,583
how his daughter
has grown up?

448
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,541
What man wouldn't
step forward to claim

449
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,791
parentage of
such a beauty?

450
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,541
Sometimes I wonder
if mom did drugs.

451
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,583
Look guys, it's them!

452
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:43,666
You're right.

453
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,166
I wanna hear more
about that reward.

454
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,416
Huh

455
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,875
Hey, I know her father.
Hell, I am her father.

456
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:59,958
Check it out. Hey!

457
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,208
Wow! Koyo has a
whole bunch of dads!

458
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,166
Well, this isn't
what I had intended,

459
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,041
but it sure is hilarious.

460
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,875
It always ends up
like this, doesn't it?

461
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,333
I know what you mean.

462
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,791
Look at Koyomi,
she seems so happy.

463
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:17,083
Happy? She's beside herself.

464
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,333
[TEACHER] It's time to
put our plan into motion.

465
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,541
[YUKINA] Agreed.

466
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:53,041
[YUKINA] Not even the star
mark can save you now.

467
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:31,958
Kosame, why are you
hugging that empty soda can?

468
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,083
Miss Kirie gave this to me.

469
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:37,125
It's a present.
A gift from my love!

470
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,416
Um, it's trash, Kosame.

471
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,625
Girls Bravo
Season Two, next episode,

472
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,500
"Present is Bravo!"

473
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,583
She shouldn't have...

474
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,208
Well, you're
right about that.
