00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,708
[ANNOUNCER]
And there's the whistle.

2
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,041
The game is over.
Japan did it.

3
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,458
What a miraculous win!

4
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,000
[ANNOUNCER 2]
That was amazing.

5
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,125
Truly, a historic match.

6
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,083
How right you are.

7
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,291
They've met their opponents

8
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,958
on the field of battle
and bested them.

9
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,416
But when the match is over,

10
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,083
they all share
the same love of soccer.

11
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,625
And look! The players
are exchanging uniforms.

12
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,458
It's quite touching.

13
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,291
What a wonderful
act of friendship.

14
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:30,500
Friendship, huh?

15
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,541
What a bunch of bologna.

16
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,000
Wow! They did it!

17
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,333
They sure did!

18
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,416
The blue uniformed
people won the game!

19
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,666
I'm so glad for them!

20
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,958
They really gave it their all!

21
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,666
Those players
are just amazing!

22
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,875
And the coach!

23
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,916
I haven't been
this excited since--

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,416
Phew! I almost missed Poyon.

25
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,458
Good thing I switched over!

26
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,791
That was unbelievable!

27
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,250
You could color me shocked!

28
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,208
Hey! What's the big idea?!

29
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,000
Tomo's watching TV!

30
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,541
Are you kidding me?!

31
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,750
We weren't done
watching soccer yet!

32
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,291
But Tomo watches
Poyon's show every single day!

33
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,750
So watch it tomorrow!

34
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,583
Ours happens
once every four years!

35
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,416
It must not be very popular!

36
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,208
Come on, it's a
damned re-run!

37
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,500
Shut up already!

38
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,333
Stop it, you
little brat!

39
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,375
Just give me
the clicker!

40
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,041
[YUKINARI] Maybe we
could find a way

41
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,750
to make everybody happy.

42
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,041
[KIRIE and TOMO]
Huh?

43
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,583
[KIRIE and TOMO]
Nobody asked you to butt in!

44
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,875
[YUKINARI]
Just trying to help!

45
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,041
Yukinari, are you all right?

46
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:42,375
Uh-oh. I think it's broken.

47
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,208
Yeah, it's cause Tomoka
was acting like a little brat.

48
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,583
Hey! Tomo is
not a little brat!

49
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,458
Really?

50
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,458
That cartoon you were
watching is a little kid's show.

51
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,750
I just assumed that only
a little kid would like it.

52
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:56,916
[KIRIE laughs]

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,166
Tomo is not a little kid!

54
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,416
On Seiren, Tomo is super
mature and super elite.

55
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,000
Just to prove it, I'm gonna
show you my magic powers!

56
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,916
Magic?

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,791
That's right, Kirie.

58
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:12,333
Tomoka is a very distinguished
person back on Seiren.

59
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,625
That's why she's
allowed to practice magic.

60
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,916
Not like me.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,416
I'm just a failure
who can't do anything right.

62
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,541
But it's probably something

63
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,375
totally random
and useless, right?

64
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:28,333
Like how Miharu can
cause an explosion?

65
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:32,625
Oh yeah! I'll show you
what my magic can do!

66
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,916
Tomo knows how to
magically transform stuff.

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,166
And to prove it,

68
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,541
I'm gonna turn Ebi
into something different.

[BOTH] Wow!

72
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:51,958
I told you so!

73
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,083
Tomo's magical
powers are top-notch!

74
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,041
But don't be afraid, Earthlings.

75
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,125
The mighty Tomo
means you no harm.

76
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:02,041
She is so cute!

77
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,250
Aww, she's like a little doll.

78
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,000
I just wanna squeeze her!

Yes, you really
are cute, aren't you?

80
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,125
I wonder if she can talk.

81
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,291
Say what?

Oh, she's just adorable!

little noises of hers.

your little finger,
aren't you, cutie?

Hello. Hey, you guys...

really great, aren't they?

Okay, everyone pay
attention to Tomo now.

Listen up!

93
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,958
What a waste of time.

94

Who needs friends when
they already have a soul mate?

I just know he's realized
our connection by now.

96
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,250
Don't worry, darling Yukinari.

97
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,791
Lisa Fukuyama,
the love of your life,

98
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,458
is only moments away.

My dearest Yukinari!

100
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,291
It's time to bask in
our pre-destined bliss.

101
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,083
Geez, Tomoka, chill out!

102
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,125
Ow! My head!

Lisa!

104
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,416
What was all
that yelling about?

105
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,625
Who are you supposed to be?

106
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,750
Hand over that thing,

107
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,416
or you and me are
gonna have problems.

108
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,250
Uh, hi there Lisa.

109
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,958

111
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:19,041
Yeah. This is
Fukuyama's younger sister.

112
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,291
Fukuyama's younger sister?

113
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,500
So you're the younger sister

114
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,833
of that perverted
Earthling guy I kidnapped.

115
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,833
It's a pleasure to meet you.

116
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,166
I don't wanna have to hurt you,

117
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,625
so you should give
Ebi to me right now.

118
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,083
What on earth is that
little girl talking about?

119
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,791
Tomo is not a little girl!

Just hand over Ebi already,
okay Blondie?!

I'm still gonna change you
back to your ugly old self.

You're not being
very nice to her!

You're just a stranger,
so what do you know?

133
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,666
It's a tricky alien beast

134
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,375
that acts like a pretty
little girl to sucker people in.

00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,625
Leave her alone!

136

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,166
Here we go...

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,041
Uh... Tomoka...

139
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,875
You've got some nerve, Blondie.

140
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:26,166
Prepare yourself for
the awesome wrath of Tomo!

141
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,625
Huh?

142
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,458
Come on.

143
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,291
I can't believe she made
this appear in your living room.

144
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,541
It's unbelievable all right.

145
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,958
That's great, but how
do we get it out of here?

146
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,208
She's pretty darn good...

147
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,375
for just an Earthling I mean.

148
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:14,666
Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

149

Nine. Ten.
Eleven. Twelve. Thirt--

150
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,208
Nya! Nya!

151
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,833
Nya nya nya?

152
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,375
Hey! This isn't
a playground in here, you know?

153
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,583
Nya?

154
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,583
Maybe bringing her
here wasn't such a good idea.

155
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,916
Nya, nya, nya...

156
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,958
Put a sock in it!

158
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,958
Oh, hey Big Brother.

159
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:27,291
Do you remember that voodoo
doll I asked you to make me?

160
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,000
Nya?

161
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,250
You are so damned cute!

162
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,458
Look at those
thin alabaster legs,

163
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,708
sticking out of your shirt.

164
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,416
Your slender body
that would snap

165
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
under anything but
the lightest embrace.

166
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,000
You, who meow up at me
with tear-filled eyes,

167
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,750
just like a frightened
little animal.

168
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,541
You are perfection!

169
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,791
An angel made flesh!

170
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,916
I, Kazuharu Fukuyama,
thank the heavens above

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,375
for sending down
such a sublime creature.

172
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,333
Nya! Nya! Nya! Nya!

173
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,625
It's okay. Here let me see you.

174
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,833
Nya, nya...

175
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:04,958
Aww, look at you.

176
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,083
Such a cute
little trouble-maker.

177
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,000
Watching you's going
to be a full-time job.

178
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,666
Lisa...

179
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,541
You're my younger sister,
and I respect that,

180
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:20,000
but if you try to keep me away
from that stunning cherub,

181
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,041
I'll never forgive you.

182
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,541
My, my.

183
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,291
For somebody who spends most of
her time shut away in her room,

184
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,166
Miss Lisa has
a lot of guests today.

185
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,208
Master Kazuharu
will be so pleased.

186
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,166
Coming. The ones in red
are coming to get me.

187
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,625
She's here.
That crazy naked woman.

188
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,250
That pervert will find me.

189
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,958
You bunch of 'fraidy cats.

190
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:51,041
Nothing's gonna happen
with Tomo here to protect you!

191
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,291
[TOMO laughs]

192
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:55,500
This time, Blondie's going down!

193
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,916
Do watch your step.

194
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,125
Nya... Nya...

195
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,208
Faster! Faster!

196
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,583
Wait for me!

197
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,833
Hurry up!

198
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,416
Hold on, wait for me.

199
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,458
Nya, nya!

200
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,166
Hey! Stop it!
That really tickles.

201
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,208
Come on, cut it out Ellie.

202
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,708
Nya, nyo?

203
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,125
Sorry about that.

204
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,916
Right then you reminded me
of somebody I used to know.

205
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,458
Nyo?

206
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,125
Nyo...

207
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,791
A photo?

208
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,208
Yes.

209
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,875
It was taken when Mistress Lisa
was still very young.

210
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,166
And that's Ellie,
her favorite doll.

211
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,916
Ellie?

212
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,125
It's been ten years,
but it feels like yesterday.

213
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,458
Where could you be hiding?

214
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,791
Ellie?

215
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,750
Ellie, come out!

216
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:18,958
[EILLIE] Boo!

217
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:23,333
Ellie! Don't scare me like that.

218
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,916
Hurry up, and let's play!

219
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,458
It was all thanks
to the book I found

220
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,666
the first time I went
down into that laboratory.

221
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,875
By performing the rites
written inside of it,

222
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:40,458
I brought my doll
Ellie to life.

223
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:46,166
We did everything together:
play time, baths, bedtime.

224
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,708
We were inseparable.

225
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,458
Ellie was the one person
I felt comfortable with.

226
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:13,000
But our good times
ended too soon.

227
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:17,916
Ellie! What should
we play with today?

228
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:28,500
Ellie? Ellie?
Is something wrong?

229
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:32,166
Why aren't you moving?
Stop playing around!

230
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,625
It isn't funny anymore.

231
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,083
You're so mean!

232
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:41,458
You didn't even
say goodbye, Ellie.

233
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,958
So that's what happened.

234
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,458
Correct.

235
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:50,250
Hey, I wonder if Lisa's
reliving her memories with Ebi.

236
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,833
Maybe Ebi reminds her of
that doll she used to have.

237
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,166
It is possible.

238
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,875
I think maybe we should
all go try to cheer up Lisa.

239
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,166
Mm. You're right.

240
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,375
Let's go see if we can
find the two of them.

241
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,375
Well, I guess even
she has her good qualities.

242
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,958
Hey, Koyomi, we're going
to be heading out pretty soon.

243
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:14,125
Oh, I think I'll stay behind
and help clean up a bit more,

244
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,916
if that's all right.

245
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Tomoka!

246
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,875
What got into her?

247
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,750
It's gonna take a lot more
than that to stop me, Lisa!

248
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:40,125
Nya, nya, nya...

249
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,833
Keep on dreaming, cutie.

250
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,958
Ellie, the only reason
I got so good at black magic

251
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,875
was to bring you back to life.

252
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,708
The spell worked
the first time I cast it,

253
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,791
but that's the only
time it ever worked.

254
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,333
I tried so many times,

255
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,000
that I knew the
pentagrams by heart.

256
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,875
But you never
woke up again, Ellie.

257
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,416
Oh, I'm sorry.

258
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,250
I didn't mean to wake you up.

259
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,375
Hey! My face is super ticklish!

260
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,000
Remember me, Blondie?

261
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,500
Tomoka, you did hear
that story back there, right?

262
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,875
It's true.

263
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,916
Lisa had her reasons
for acting like she did.

264
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,791
So there's nothing
to fight about, right?

265
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,541
It's way too late for excuses.

266
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,791
Tomo's here
to settle the score

267
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,416
with that blond
black magic bimbo.

so I'll go first.

Cease fire, monster troops.

nothing left of her.

Yeah, it's like a cartoon.

would have fighting monsters?

00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,416
That a girl, Tomoka.

331
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,458
Ellie.

332
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,250
[ELLIE barks]

333
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:40,375
Um, Tomo knows how much you
wanted to see your doll again.

334
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,875
Tomo heard about before.

335
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,916
It was sad.

336
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:52,875
So then, you used magic
to make this Ellie for me?

337
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:58,625
Tomo admits that she
lost this time, so I guess...

338
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,541
I think that...

339
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:06,000
Maybe you and me could
kinda sorta be friends.

340
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,500
Huh?

341
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,416
When the match is over,
everyone becomes friends.

342
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,541
That's how it works here.
I saw it on TV.

343
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,458
You won, fair and square,
and the match is over.

344
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,916
So Blondie and Tomo
are friends now.

345
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:23,125
You know, the TV
isn't always right...

346
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:28,583
But...

347
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,666
If you really wanna
be friends with me,

348
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,500
I guess it would be kinda
neat to have you as one.

349
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,833
[ELLIE barks]

350
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,750
You're glad it
worked out. Me too.

351
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,958
Nya nyaa! Nya nya nyuu!
Nya nyu nya nyu...!

352
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,833
Hey, come on, that tickles!

353
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,541
[TOMO] I know!

354
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,375
You should come over to
our house and watch Poyon!

355
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,375
[LISA] When is it on?

356
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,333
Don't worry, I recorded it!
