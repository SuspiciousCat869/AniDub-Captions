Look Yukinari,
I'm right over here.

Yukinari!

[HIJIRI] Yes.

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,750
Do any still resist us?

11
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,875
A few misguided fools.

12
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,458
They'll be shown
the error of their ways.

13
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,958
I see. What about...

[HIJIRI chuckles]

00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,833
You have thought of
everything, haven't you?

16
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,375
Tell me, what do we do

17
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,625
if the other one
realizes her powers?

18
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:14,250
Even if she does...
the answer is simple.

19
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,500
We kill her.

20
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,791
[HIJIRI laughs evily]

00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,833
Miharu!

22
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,791
We're tired of playing
hide and seek.

23
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,791
Come out, come out
wherever you are!

24
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,750
Nya nya nya.

25
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,166
[HAYATE] Well? Any
sign of her up there?

26
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,833
[KOSAME] Uh-Uhn.

27
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:35,708
Hmph. Yukinari gets cured,
so of course Miharu

28
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,708
has to spoil it all
by running away.

29
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,666
That girl is such
a party pooper.

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,500
Oh! Hey, Yukinari, is Miharu...

31
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,083
Oh, I see.

32
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:02,958
Hmm. Well, it appears that
Miharu has left the house.

33
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,083
Thanks, Sherlock.

34
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,166
Any idea where she
might have gone?

35
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,916
She'll come back
when she's hungry.

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,541
But... better safe than sorry.

37
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,166
Hello, it's me.

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,250
Uh-huh. Can you
bring the device?

39
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,458
What device?

40
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,083
Now, now. Be patient.

[LLICA] Sorry for
the delay, Master.

00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,208
There was traffic.

Bastard!

You know I wondered how you
were alwaysable to pop up

00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,666
wherever we were at
just the right moment.

48
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,041
But a spy satellite?

49
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,416
That's low, even for you!

50
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,916
That's water under
the bridge, Kirie.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,833
Let sleeping dogs lie, you know?

52
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,750
Oh, you're a dog all right.

53

You perverted peeping
tom piece of shit!

54
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,625
[LILICA] Koyomi, about what
time did Miharu come home today?

55
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:54,208
Um, I think that she
came home around 6 p.m.

56
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,791
[LILICA] This is a
satellite photograph

57
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,958
of Yukinari Sasaki's
neighborhood.

58
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,000
Let's zoom in closer.

59
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,958
Wow! You should check
this thing out, Kirie!

60
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:08,125
It even shows you the people
walking down the sidewalk!

61
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,625
Hey, you're right. Pretty cool.

62
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,000
Of course.

63
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:15,333
If there's one thing the
Fukuyama Group excels at,

64
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,500
it's surveillance technology.

65
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,333
The images are quite detailed.

66
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,916
The ratio is one pixel
to every centimeter.

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,291
[LISA]
Ooh! Right there!

68

That purple blob's Miharu!

69
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,791
[LILICA] Now I'll start
cycling through the images

70
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:32,458
in 5 minute intervals.

71
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,916
There!

72
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,250
That light! It can't be...

73
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,000
Isn't that the bathroom window?

74
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,583
Then Miharu might have...

75
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,958
gone back to... Seiren.

76
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,875
But why?

77
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,458
That's stupid.
Why would she just leave?

78
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,541
Nya nya!

79
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,041
Oh my, what's this?

80
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,458
What's wrong, Lilica?

81
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,458
Well, I shortened the
interval between images

82
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,916
and played it back.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,041
There seems to be another
woman entering into the house.

84
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,416
Another woman... is she hot?

85
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,000
Hold on! That looks like
our teacher, Ms. Hijiri.

86
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:15,875
Uh-oh! Something's got
Koyo all freaked out!

87
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,583
We have to find our
Aqua Lamps right now!

88
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,083
We're too late.

89
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,916
Koyomi... what?

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,458
Ahh! Koyo! The Aqua Lamp!

91
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,041
Someone stole both
of our Aqua Lamps!

92
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,458
Look, they're just gone!

93
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,666
Special Forces! They did it!

94
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,166
Say what?!

95
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,750
Wait, who took what, where?

96
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:46,833
The Special Forces took Miharu
and swiped our tickets home.

97
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:51,375
And now... we'll never...
ever see Seiren again.

98
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,291
It's all right, Tomoka.

99
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,875
Hey! Wait a second.

100
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,541
What are the Special Forces?

101
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,500
And why did they kidnap Miharu?

102
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,625
Yukinari...

103
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,125
But they did!

104
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,750
Koyomi, can you please tell
us what this is all about?

105
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,333
Mhmm.

106
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,750
The Special Forces unit
is one of the branches

107
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,083
of the Seiren Space
Management Bureau.

108
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,333
Tomoka and I are in
a different branch.

109
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,625
We investigate missing
persons cases.

110
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:22,833
Most of the people who disappear
from Seiren do it accidentally,

111
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,500
but if anyone leaves illegally,

112
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:28,125
it's the Special Forces' job to
bring them back for punishment.

113
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,708
Whoa. You bring them
back for punishment?

114
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,958
Yes. But that sort of thing
almost never happens.

115
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,500
So long as a member of the
Space Management Bureau

116
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,791
accompanies the traveler
and watches over them,

117
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:43,333
the punishment is
usually waived.

118
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:46,500
With us here, Miharu
should have been fine.

119
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,166
But, even with the two of
you here, they took her.

120
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,041
So, why?

121
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:55,875
I think I know. It's because
of Miharu's unique ability.

122
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,333
Miharu's unique...ability?

123
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,541
That mark on her forehead.

124
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,208
The same mark your mother has.

125
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,750
Well, uh... yes.

126
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,125
So that mark... it's like...

127
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,750
Sacred.

128
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,416
It... is?

129
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,708
That's right.

130
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,375
They call it the star mark.

131
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,083
You see, whosoever
wears the star mark

132
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,083
has the power to open
a watery gateway

133
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,833
between Seiren and Earth.

134
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:26,333
Anyone who's born with that
mark can open a gateway.

135
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,416
It's rare.

136
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,083
What are you talking about?

137
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,916
How come you never
told Tomo this before?

138
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,875
I'm so sorry.

139
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,083
Chief Nanae and myself
are the only ones

140
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,458
in our department
who know about this.

141
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,125
The only reason
I've known about it

142
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,083
is because my mother had
the same sacred mark.

143
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:47,125
My father was brought to Seiren
through my mother's power,

144
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,791
just like Miharu
brought Yukinari.

145
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,166
but...

146
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,583
The Special Forces.

147
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,166
Yes.

148
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,125
But why would they kidnap a girl
being watched by bureau agents?

149
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,208
I have no idea.

150
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,916
But if they went to the trouble

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
of sending an agent
all the way to Earth,

152
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:07,750
and keeping her
so deep under cover...

153
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,291
they must really want her.

154
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,333
The gateway that connects us
between Seiren and Earth

155
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,791
has already been sealed.

156
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,375
And without our Aqua Lamps,

157
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:21,166
we can't even send them a
transmission to ask why.

158
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,333
There's no way home.

159
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:27,791
Then that means...
I'll never see Miharu again?

160
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,333
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,916
I didn't watch
her closely enough.

162
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,458
This is all my fault.

163
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:40,291
Hey, Puny-nari.
Weren't you listening?!

164
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,500
They've taken Miharu!

165

Hey!

00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,791
Aren't you angry?

167
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,500
Why don't you act
like a man for once?

168
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,875
Stop it, Fukuyama!

Dammit!

You're just a
pathetic little boy.

00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,541
All right, I'll go and
rescue Miharu myself!

it's time we were going.

him at a time like this?

right for once.

and Tomoka stranded here?

never see Miharu again?

Yukinari, you have
to be strong. Okay?

am I supposed to do?

Miharu has no eye for fashion.

That's for sure.

So, uh, where's Tomoka?

00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:25,041
Upstairs. She said she
wanted to be alone.

We must find a way to
get through to Seiren.

The dignity of the Fukuyama
family is at stake!

you bought for me.

Yea, by their
cotton and elastic.

I, Kazuharu Fukuyama, will
travel to Seiren and rescue you!

I don't even know which side's
the top and which is the bottom!

How come Miharu bought me this

Nya nya.

What I really wanted

219
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:23,791
was the Poyon magical
transformation set.

220

This is like a

about this thing!

If I don't tell her,
who's gonna?

say something, huh?

Check it out, Boss,
this guy's crying.

Aww, did the big bad
man make you cry?

[BOSS] Hey, kid.
Crying never solved anything.

238
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,958
You gotta struggle.

239
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,541
You gotta keep fighting
the good fight.

240

[BOSS] And once you've
given it your all,

if your best wasn't good
enough, then you can cry.

know you could talk.

anything to say until now.

you were always so sweet...

247
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:26,250
so unique... so innocent.

248
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,291
And you ate a lot.

249
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:37,208
You liked... to laugh.

250
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:41,208
Before I knew it, we were
already living together.

Although it got crazy sometimes,

252

I still...
remember every moment.

253
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,916
Because... because you
were with me, Miharu.

254
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's all because of you....

255
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,666
that I was able to smile.

256
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,416
The reason why I don't
have to worry...

257
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,458
and the fact that my
girl allergy is gone...

258
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:06,791
and the reason that I
can now laugh freely...

259
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:11,916
it's all because...
you were with me, Miharu.

260
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,041
Miharu, please don't worry.

261
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,208
I'll bring you back
here no matter what!

262
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:22,291
I'll find a way to get to
Seiren and share with you

263
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,000
the things that you gave to me.

264
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:28,083
I swear. I'm going
to bring you back!

I wanted to hear.

Don't you give up, Yukinari.

all the way on Seiren.

You're meant to be together.

Yeah, what she said!

271
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,208
I think that Kirie is right.

272
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,958
All of us meeting one
another like this

273
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,208
wasn't just some coincidence.

274
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,791
I know you'll see Miharu again.

275

Yes. I'm absolutely
sure about it.

Right, Tomoka?

277

You said it! I'm gonna
see her again, too.

278
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:12,166
So she can take this
ugly thing back

279
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,833
and get me a Poyon magical
transformation set.

I'm absolutely sure about that!

It's time for us
to investigate here.

What's Lisa doing?

If she thinks she can steal my
soul mate's heart and run away,

she's got another thing coming!

Besides, there's that thing.

304

If she doesn't tell me what
it is and which end is up

305
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:20,458
it's gonna bug me for the

Which way did they go?

They couldn't have
gone far, don't worry.

Looks like we've bought
ourselves some time.

00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,416
So the Special Forces
took Miharu?

325
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,791
[NANAE] Yes, I'm afraid so.

326
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,000
Then we have to get over
there and save her!

327
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,208
[MAHARU] I'm sorry,
there's no way for us

328
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,541
to teleport you
to Seiren right now.

329
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,208
However, there just
might be another way.

330
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,416
Please! Tell us what it is,

331
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,791
and keep in mind that
money is no object!

332
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:40,166
And if that doesn't work,
maybe my magic can do it!

333
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,208
Maharu, please tell us
what to do. Hurry!

334
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:48,375
Koyomi... you might have
the same power as Miharu...

335
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,458
A power passed down
from your mother.

336
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,750
You might have the star mark.

337
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,041
The star mark?!

338
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,333
[SPECIAL FORCES GUARDS]
Hey, they're over here!

339
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,875
[MAHARU]
Dammit.

340
00:19:56,958 --> 00:20:01,416
It's up to you Koyomi, you're
the only one who can do it.

341
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,083
[KOYOMI]
Maharu!

342
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,208
Koyomi...

343
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,375
I can't. I could never
have a power like that.

344
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,583
I mean... you all know
how useless I am.

345
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:20,083
I just get into trouble
and mess things up.

346
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:24,541
All of this... it happened
because I wasn't careful.

347
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,166
Koyo, you're wrong.

348
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,958
The only one who thinks
you're useless is you.

349
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,208
Because the rest of us know

350
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,041
there are bunches of wonderful
things about you.

351
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:40,125
Tomoka...

352
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,625
Really?

353
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,250
Mm.

354
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,291
Father... Mother...

355
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,916
I need you. Please,
give me your strength.

356
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,041
[DAD] It's... Koyomi.

357
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,791
Everybody... it's time to go.

358
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:25,666
Hmph . You don't
have to tell me twice.

359
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,875
Koyomi, are you all right?

360
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,375
Yes. But please hurry.

361
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,666
I've never done this before,

362
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,625
this gate doesn't
feel very stable.

363
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,625
It could close at any moment.

364
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,000
Come on, don't get all
stressed out over that.

365
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:43,708
Even if it closes, if we can get
to Seiren and rescue Miharu,

366
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,708
she can open a new one for us.

367
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,833
Yeah! And Tomo could
show the others

368
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,958
how to get to the Space
Management Bureau.

369
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:50,958
Nya nyo.

370
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,708
So don't worry about us.

371
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:55,125
We'll be back with Miharu
before you know it.

372
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,458
Right.

373
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,958
Lilica, would you please
watch over Koyomi for us?

374
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:02,083
It would be my
pleasure Miss Kirie.

375
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:09,083
And Kosame, we'll need
you to protect her also!

376
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,250
All right! Onward!

377
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:16,458
Miharu...

378
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,500
We're going to save you.
I promise!

379
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,958
Yukinari...

380
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,791
What? It's almost over?

381
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,708
Everything has an end,
no matter what.

382
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,375
Let's finish strong.

383
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:07,375
Does that mean
that I don't have

384
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:09,291
to be afraid of
Fukuyama anymore?

385
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,583
That's what I like
to hear, Koyomi.

386
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,791
It's time we showed
those friend-nappers

387
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:14,750
what we're made of!

388
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,125
Nya nya!

389
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:19,833
Girls Bravo, Season two,
next episode, "Final Bravo!"

390
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,666
Don't miss it!

391
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,958
Yukinari, I love you!
