1
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,458
[KIRIE] Look, I don't know
how you got it into your head

2
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,833
that Yukinari was
the guy for you,

3
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,875
but trust me on this,
it wouldn't work out.

4
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,958
Because Yukinari's
afraid of women.

5
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,708
She's so hard-headed.

6
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,625
Like I should talk.

7
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:44,916
Okay, Mom! I'll be over at
Yukinari's house if you need me!

8
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,041
Hey, don't wanna forget that.

9
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,666
I put tons of work into this,

10
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,083
and it'll all be for
nothing if I leave it here.

11
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,500
I'll see ya later!

12
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:11,708
Hold on... wasn't that Miharu?

13
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,416
I wonder where she's off to.

14
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,083
But if she's out right now...

15
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:23,125
That means Yukinari's
home all by himself.

16
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh, why am I getting
so nervous all of a sudden?

17
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,250
I mean, this is
my lucky break, right?

18
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,666
Come on,
just press the button

19
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,000
like usual
and open the door.

20
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,041
[doorbell rings]

21
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,958
Huh?
[doorbell rings]

22
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,625
Yukinari!
Answer the damn door!

23
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,166
Yukinari?

24
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,708
So the other day
I'm walking down the street,

25
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,833
and this really disheveled
guy comes stumbling up to me.

26
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,333
I don't get it.

27
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,958
In this note, Miharu said
she was going out for a while,

28
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,500
and that
she'll be back later.

29
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,916
But that's no reason
to be so down about it.

30
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,666
Besides, it's not
like the two of you

31
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,500
are joined at
the hip or something.

32
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:34,083
She can't spend
every minute with you.

33
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,833
Maybe something
unexpected came up, right?

34
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,791
I'm sure she'll be back
home in time for dinner.

35
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,250
Okay?

36
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,916
Yukinari...

37
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,041
If you're like this now,

38
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,041
what are you going
to do if Miharu ends up

39
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,416
returning to Seiren some day?

40
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,416
Seiren?

41
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,041
Sorry, that was
a stupid thing to say.

42
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,375
And that's exactly
what's going to happen.

43
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,541
Huh?

44
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,666
Miharu... I mean
just look at me.

45
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,416
She's definitely gonna go back
to Seiren one of these days.

46
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:20,833
Because I'm slow and puny.
She's gonna throw me away.

47
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,125
Stop.

48
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,458
Why would Miharu do
something dumb like that?

49
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,000
You are so... it's okay.

50
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,833
I'm sure that's not
what happened this time.

51
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,208
This time?

52
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,416
What do you mean it's
not what happened this time?

53
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,625
What? Well, uh...
I didn't mean anything.

54
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,500
But do you
know what happened?

55
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,958
Well, I saw her riding
in a car on my way over.

56
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:46,083
I don't think Seiren
had anything to do with it.

57
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,041
She was in a car? What kind?!

58
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,791
Um... it was
an expensive white import...?

59
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:54,125
I didn't know I was gonna
get grilled about it later!

60
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:57,666
So it was an expensive
white import...

61
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,666
She wouldn't
ride with a stranger.

62
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,708
Now, who does Miharu know
with that kind of a car?

63
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,250
[BOTH gasp]

64
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,833
[BOTH] Fukuyama!

65
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,083
That's terrible!

66
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,750
I have to go save
Miharu right now!

67
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,458
Oh geez!

68
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,416
Yukinari, wait for me!

69
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,125
I've never been here before.

70
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:28,166
The word "mansion"
doesn't quite cover it.

71
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,541
[LILICA] Might I help
you two with something?

72
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:44,083
Um, uh, hi... is Fuku- I mean,
is Kazuharu here right now?

73
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,500
Ya see, we're friends
of his from school.

74
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,958
And we were in the neighborhood
just now, and well...

75
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,958
Wait, Yukinari, why'd you say
that we're friends with him?

76
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,916
If we tell her the truth,
she won't let us in.

77
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,125
Just leave the talking to me.

78
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,291
What? What did you just say?

79
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,291
What?

80
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,416
What did you say
just a moment ago?

81
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Uh, I said that we're
both friends of Kazuharu's.

82
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:09,583
Friends?!
Master Kazuharu has friends?!

83
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,208
Excuse my outburst.

84
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,541
The shock has rendered me
slightly light-headed.

85
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,833
Uh, what do you
mean "the shock"?

86
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,708
Well then, if there
are no more questions,

87
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,791
would the young
lady care to step inside?

88
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,000
Huh? But why only me?

89
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:26,708
Hey, wait a minute,
can't I go in too?

90
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,083
A thousand pardons,

91
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:31,875
but Master Kazuharu's
hatred of men is unrivaled.

92
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,291
That is all.

93
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:39,375
Think I'm throwing
in the towel, do you?

94
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,250
I'm a new man today,
so look out!

95
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:52,250
If Miharu needs rescuing,
I'll show this wall who's boss!

96
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,083
Just wait!

97
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,750
Miharu!

98
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,625
Where am I?

99
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,708
I think I've been
going in circles...

100
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,125
I don't even see
the mansion anymore.

101
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,125
Maybe I should catch
my breath for a second.

102
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,166
And then I'll go on.

103
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,041
This is the heliport;
the pool's down that way.

104
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,916
Oh.

105
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,041
Fukuyama's stupid,
but he sure is rich.

106
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,458
[rapid gunfire]
Ah!

107
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,208
Is something the matter?

108
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:39,041
Is something the...
wasn't that gunfire just now?!

109
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes. It would seem that
a mouse has sneaked in.

110
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,291
An amateur.

111
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,708
Has anyone ever suggested

112
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,833
that you might be taking
pest control a little too far?

113
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,041
Let us go inside now.

114
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,541
Huh?

115
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,666
Unfortunately, Master Kazuharu
is taking a nap right now,

116
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,083
but I will take full
responsibility for your welfare

117
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,458
and show you around
the mansion in the meantime.

118
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,041
Uh, don't go to any trouble.

119
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,583
I'm simply implying
that right now it is

120
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,708
much safer to
be indoors than out.

121
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:10,500
But, hey... what's
that supposed to mean?

122
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,750
Any closer, and I'd look
like swiss cheese.

123
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,333
Ah, but I'm not
going to give up!

124
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:28,041
No! I have to rescue Miharu
from Fukuyama's lewd clutches!

125
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,500
Crap!

126
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,541
Damn, I missed.

127
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,041
This is Alpha One, I've cited
the intruder. I am in pursuit.

128
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:44,583
What the heck's going on?!

129
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,708
What's with this place?!

130
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:06,500
Hey! Where'd all this wind
suddenly come from?!

131
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,916
All central air conditioning
is automatically routed

132
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,833
through the vents
near the floor.

133
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,000
Something wrong?

134
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,666
Will you just
turn the thing off?!

135
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,125
Stop it!

136
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,000
This way please.

137
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,916
Damn it.
What's with this place?

138
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,250
It would seem that
your bra is too small.

139
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,291
Is that an oversight or
a matter of preference?

140
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,666
Say what?

141
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,000
Your measurements are
89 on top and 64 underneath.

142
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:43,458
Might I be so bold as to suggest
that you stop wearing an F cup.

143
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,791
It would be a waste

144
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,041
of such lovely bountiful
breasts as yours.

145
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,791
When did my chest
become such a hot topic?

146
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,791
This elevator is designed
to perform a full body MRI

147
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,458
of all of its female passengers.

148
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,541
It then strips away the clothes
from that computer image

149
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,000
and measures one's bust,
waist, and hips.

150
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,125
Truth be known,
it's a very innovative system.

151
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,875
Not to mention,
a very expensive one.

152
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,291
Master Kazuharu can enjoy
all female visitors' bodies

153
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:15,416
in 3-d rendered,
real-time virtual imagery.

154
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:22,791
This technology was pioneered
by the Fukuyama Science Fou--

155
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,291
That took five years to develop.

156
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,500
Are you stupid?
This machine is pointless!

157
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:28,833
If you're going
to make something,

158
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,708
why not make something
useful for society!

159
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,041
I'm sensing you
didn't much like it.

160
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,958
Why would I?!

161
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,375
Let's move on then.

162
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,666
I wanna go home.

163
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,250
Damn it all,
we lost the target.

164
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,000
Don't worry about it.

165
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,666
Come on, let's check out
the next sector.

166
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,916
Okay Romeo 6-4,

167
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,125
we're moving on to
the north quadrant.

168
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,083
[HEADQUARTERS]
Understood Alpha Two.

169
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm still alive.

170
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,791
Okay, now what?

171
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:14,000
How am I going to find
my way out of this maze?

172
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,708
No way! I can't let
myself get discouraged.

173
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,291
Right now, the only thing
I should worry about

174
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:26,708
is how to save Miharu!

175
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,166
What?

176
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,250
Today's mouse
is very energetic.

177
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,750
Wouldn't you
agree with me?

178
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,166
Oh, I'm talking to myself.

179
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,250
But where on
earth did she go?

180
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,375
I needed that.

181
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,791
Master Kazuharu.

182
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,708
Lilica.

183
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,416
Are you awake Master?

184
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,958
Why are you talking to me?

185
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,666
My sincere apologies.

186
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,875
You had a visitor--
a buxom young woman

187
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,125
who mentioned to me that
she was a friend of yours.

188
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,083
Friend of mine?

189
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,458
I was showing her
around the mansion,

190
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,333
but I seem to have lost her.

191
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,708
Huh. I don't know.

192
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:08,708
It's nothing to brag about,
but I don't really have friends.

193
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,916
I, Lilica,
regret her disappearance.

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,833
Oh, nevermind. Speaking of
girls, where's you-know-who?

195
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,666
Right. Miharu's
in a room in the back.

196
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,791
I see.

197
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,916
Come on!
How the hell

198
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,375
am I supposed to get out
of this place anyway?

199
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,958
Oh. All I wanted was to have
some quality time with Yukinari,

200
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:52,250
and I even got up
extra early to make this.

201
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,750
Why does it always
have to turn out this way?

202
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,708
Huh?

203
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,791
Hey! Miharu?

204
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,583
Oh. Hmm? Kirie?

205
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,625
What happened?

206
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,500
There's only one pervert
who would do such a thing!

207
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,625
Fukuyama! Is this
your idea of a joke?!

208
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,833
I want my clothes
back this instant!

209
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:39,291
Fukuyama!
Are you listenin--

210
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,333
[KIRIE yells]
Fukuyama?

211
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,583
What's wrong, Fukuyama?

212
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,875
Are you okay, Fukuyama?

213
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,833
What happened to you, Fukuyama?

214
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,250
Hey, Fukuyama!

215
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,541
Are you stupid?!

216
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,875
Ever since
I made the mistake

217
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,500
of trying that nasty ass
bento you brought me,

218
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,833
I've been barfing non-stop!

219
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:56,208
Huh? Oh, you've
been eating my bento!

220
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,666
Geez, how on earth
could you possibly

221
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,333
make it taste like that?

222
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,708
I probably have stuff

223
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:05,250
in my garbage cans
tastier than that slop.

224
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,583
You've got some nerve!

225
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,916
I got up early and tried
my very best on this, too.

226
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,333
Of course,

227
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,541
I know it's not as good
compared to Miharu's cooking,

228
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:16,000
but I put a lot of thought into
the foods nutritional value.

229
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,083
You know, I even
counted the calories.

230
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,458
I made sure to include

231
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,750
a lot of different
kinds of ingredients

232
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,541
and packed it full
of vitamins and minerals!

233
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,250
It's not exciting,
but it's healthy!

234
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,000
It's not so bad.

235
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,208
Are you paying
attention, Fukuyama?

236
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,833
I think my groping
days are over.

237
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:37,500
What are you saying?
You can't die from my cooking.

238
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:41,625
Everything's
getting dark, Kirie.

239
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,458
Will you hear my last wish?

240
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,833
Uh, what is it?

241
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,416
Nurse me.

242
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,416
Huh?

243
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,666
If you'd be my nurse,

244
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,458
I could leave this
world without regrets.

245
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:58,125
Oh, and in a pink nurse
outfit if possible.

246
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:58,875
You son-of-a--

[FUKUYAMA coughing]

248
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,791
I guess that'd be okay.

00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,791
I just have to be
your nurse, right?

250

Looking good, Kirie.

00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,916
The fit is perfect.

253
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,458
How is it perfect?
The skirt is tiny.

254
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,708
Don't worry about that.

255
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,708
That's how I like them.

256
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,041
Hey, do you think you
could hand me that book?

257
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,916
Thank you Nurse Girl.

258
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,833
Oh no! I can't
control my hands!

The patient shouldn't
be pulling up skirts!

260

Sorry, it seems that you
have kicked me so much

261

that I've developed a terrible
case of Phantom Hands Syndrome.

262
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,958
Huh? What are you saying?

263
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,875
Please, forgive
these hands of mine,

264

they know not what they do.

265
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,750
It's just that you beat me up
over and over and over again.

266
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,625
Oh, stop it. I get it already.

267
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,083
Oh, my hands, I can't stop them.

268
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,666
Why, you...

269
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:14,041
Perverted faker!

Hmm? You didn't...
what's wrong, Kirie?

271

Just now, I swear some
little blue kid's face

272
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,875
was poking out of your chest.

What are you talking about?

Oh, Lisa.

276
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,958
I'm sorry to barge in like this.

277
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,416
I made a mistake in
my ghost-rain technique

278
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,208
and the ghosts all escaped.

279
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:43,500
I'll exorcise them right away,
it'll only take a minute.

280
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,208
All right,
just be quick, okay?

00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,000
Be gone, spirits!

sister for her unorthodox hobby.

I don't care why they're here,

286

just do something
about it already!

287
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,291
Ah, do something about it, huh?

288
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:04,000
I think you should
do something about it!

00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,750
You... must be kidding.

290

You're even hot as
a shrine maiden, Kirie.

291

Go now, tool of divine justice!

292
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:18,208
Return these lost souls to
the abyss from which they came!

293
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,625
Yes, I'll do it!

294
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:20,708
I'll defeat them!

295
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,583
What are you, nuts?!

296
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,250
Um, should I help
you clean that up?

297
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,541
No, thank you.

298
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,875
I'll be just fine on
my own, so please go

299
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,458
to Master Kazuharu's
bedroom now.

300
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,083
Yes, ma'am!

301
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,375
I'll go there right now!

302
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,625
Just like that, my room becomes
a portal to the great beyond.

303
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,000
Don't worry, Big Brother,

304
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,833
these ghosts will be
out of here any minute now.

305
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,500
I don't think
I'll be holding my breath.

306
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,291
I give up!

307
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,875
I just wanted to spend some
time with Yukinari, that's all!

308
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,750
I'm going home now.

309
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,625
Or maybe not.

310
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,000
Lisa...

311
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,708
How much longer
is this going to take?

312
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:16,541
I won't let a single
one of you escape!

313
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,041
Hold on,
what's this all about?

314
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,500
Who are you anyway?

315
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,958
W-w-w-w-what are you doing?!

316
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:32,916
Kosame. I want you
to call me Kosame.

317
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,666
I remember you. We fought
when you kidnapped my friend.

318
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,666
You looked very...
lovely that day.

319
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,375
I'd like to get to know
you a little bit better.

320
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:50,583
So how about we pick up
where we left off?

321
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:51,666
No!

322
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,875
Hey, wait a minute!

323
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,708
So this is where
you've been, Kirie?

324
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,791
Fukuya--

325
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:04,375
Would you please
take care of me, Kirie?

326
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:08,958
I'm really not feeling
all that good right now.

327
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,750
Miss Kirie...

328
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:13,708
Where were we?

329
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:20,416
[KIRIE yells]

330
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,333
Hey, wait a minute!

331
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,250
Take care of me!

332
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,416
Miss Kirie...

333
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
No!

334
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,250
Don't come near me!

335
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:34,916
All I wanted was to eat
my bento with Yukinari, okay!

336
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:36,833
Nurse Girl.

337
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:40,041
Huh?

338
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:40,916
Miharu!

339
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,833
Oh my, hi, Kirie.

340
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,000
Miharu, you're all right.

341
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,875
Yes, and you're
looking very healthy also.

342
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,458
Are you okay?

343
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,958
Did Fukuyama do
anything weird to you?

344
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:56,000
No. Fukuyama... I mean Master
and the maid named Lilica

345
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,000
have both been
extremely kind to me.

346
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,541
Master?

347
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,041
I'm working
part-time for Fuku--

348
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,541
I mean part-time
for Master now.

349
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,250
This is my first day.

350
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,625
You're working here?!

351
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,083
Uh-huh!

352
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,541
Yukinari has to buy so much
extra food to keep me fed,

353
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,291
so I thought if
I could work here,

354
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,625
I could help with
the grocery bills.

355
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,208
So naïve.

356
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,375
Fuku-- I mean, Master, told me
that I needed to call him Master

357
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,916
when I'm wearing
this uniform,

358
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,458
because it's all
part of the job.

359
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,666
I don't really
understand it yet.

360
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,333
Where are you going, Kirie?

361
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,916
I want you to wear that
outfit next, all right?

362
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,250
You and Miharu can both be

363
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,041
my cute little
tag-team pair of maids.

364
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:40,583
Go be sick... in Hell!

365
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,291
I guess that Kirie
can be a bigger handful

366
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,250
than these spirits when
she gets into one of her moods.

367
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,375
I find her to be quite barbaric.

368
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,416
But that's why she's lovely.

369
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,833
This was a long day...

370
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:12,708
I'm sorry. I really
wanted it to be a surprise.

371
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,333
Oh, don't worry about it.

372
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,583
You didn't do anything wrong.

373
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,333
Miharu?

374
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,958
Ever since I came to Earth,

375
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,250
it seems like I just
cause trouble for everyone.

376
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:32,375
Today, I got Yukinari
really worried for nothing.

377
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,708
Hey, Miharu, are you hungry?

378
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,291
Huh?

379
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:40,083
Here. Let's go
home and eat okay?

380
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,750
Yukinari can have some, too.

381
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,875
Yeah.

382
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:51,708
Kirie, I am pretty hungry,
now that you mention it.

383
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:54,000
Oh, Miharu, big surprise.

384
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:55,916
I'm looking
forward to your bento.

385
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,791
Don't look forward
to the taste though.

386
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:06,875
They're coming.

387
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:09,291
The ones in red
are coming after me.

388
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:11,958
They're coming to catch me.
