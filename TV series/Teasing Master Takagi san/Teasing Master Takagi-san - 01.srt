1
00:00:04,313 --> 00:00:05,463
Here, we say,

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,723
"I am Hanako."

3
00:00:08,206 --> 00:00:12,549
As opposed to here, where we say, "He is a teacher."

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,100
Hey, Nishikata.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,780
Huh?

6
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:26,841
What are you doing?

7
00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:29,034
Stop accusing me, Takagi.

8
00:00:29,257 --> 00:00:30,661
I'm learning.

9
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:34,211
I swear.

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,930
Right.

11
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,057
<b>"Eraser"</b>

12
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:18,873
This'll work well as a spring.

13
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:26,113
Now I have all the pieces I need
to make my desktop jack-in-the-box!

14
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,947
Just you wait, Takagi.

15
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,131
Huh?

16
00:02:36,617 --> 00:02:38,387
Hey. What's going' on?

17
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:39,453
I'm not sure.

18
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,465
My pencil case just won't open.

19
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:44,329
Maybe it got dented when I dropped it earlier.

20
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,632
Do you think you could try opening it, Nishikata?

21
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,240
Uh.

22
00:02:49,434 --> 00:02:50,696
Yeah, sure.

23
00:02:57,563 --> 00:02:59,715
You must have loosened it or something...

24
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:07,697
What is it, Nishikata?

25
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,953
Huh? Oh, it was nothing.

26
00:03:10,978 --> 00:03:12,313
I'm sorry for shouting.

27
00:03:23,961 --> 00:03:30,054
Seriously, Nishikata, you should see your face.

28
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:30,614
Ugh.

29
00:03:30,984 --> 00:03:32,112
Just shut up.

30
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:37,781
You suck.

31
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,833
She totally got me.

32
00:03:41,274 --> 00:03:44,639
And worse, she got me with
what I was about to get her with!

33
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,224
Now that I think about it,

34
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:51,046
it's unusual for Takagi to ask me for help.

35
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:54,123
Why didn't that raise any red flags in my mind?

36
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,751
I have to plan my next move.

37
00:03:57,063 --> 00:04:00,270
But how am I supposed to embarrass her of all people?

38
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:10,860
Hey.

39
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:13,314
Uh.

40
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:15,796
What's up?

41
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,140
Can I borrow your eraser?

42
00:04:18,623 --> 00:04:19,813
I forgot mine.

43
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,484
How did you forgot your eraser?
Takagi, you're such an airhead sometimes.

44
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:37,247
Guess so.

45
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:38,796
Thank you very much.

46
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:53,887
That reminds me.

47
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:55,245
Hmm?

48
00:04:55,524 --> 00:04:56,604
Know what I heard?

49
00:04:56,684 --> 00:04:58,264
If you take your eraser,

50
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,179
write the name of your crush on it, and use it all up,

51
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:02,396
they'll like you back.

52
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,880
Yeah, I've heard that before too.

53
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,464
Only a little kid would actually believe it, though.

54
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:11,935
Hmm?

55
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:15,148
A kid, huh?

56
00:05:16,557 --> 00:05:18,147
Huuh...?

57
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,065
Hmm?

58
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,279
Ahh.

59
00:05:28,744 --> 00:05:29,593
Huh?!

60
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:30,937
What do you see?

61
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,806
Huuuh?

62
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:41,828
Huh? Ohh...

63
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:46,191
Wha...

64
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,757
What are you doing?

65
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:56,483
Nothing's written on there, right?

66
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:57,916
C'mon.

67
00:05:58,296 --> 00:06:00,993
I'm not some dumb little kid who'd believe that works.

68
00:06:01,974 --> 00:06:05,681
Oho? You sure about that?

69
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,063
There's no way.

70
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,755
You're just making fun of me again, aren't you?

71
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,463
Yeah?

72
00:06:12,354 --> 00:06:13,390
You think so?

73
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:15,200
Did I actually?

74
00:06:15,617 --> 00:06:17,706
Did I actually write something on there?

75
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:19,990
And then just forget that I did?

76
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,262
You're done with it, so can you give it back now?

77
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:32,633
Sure.

78
00:06:33,713 --> 00:06:35,213
It wasn't me, I swear!

79
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:37,554
Someone else must have gotten a hold of it and then...

80
00:06:42,404 --> 00:06:44,813
I knew there was nothing written on that thing!

81
00:06:45,707 --> 00:06:46,280
Hey!

82
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,722
You didn't forget your eraser, it's right there!

83
00:06:51,464 --> 00:06:53,349
No yelling in class.

84
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,400
I'm sorry, sir.

85
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,570
Not only did you freak out, but you got in trouble!

86
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,720
I think that's enough messing around for one class.

87
00:07:07,204 --> 00:07:09,494
I should be the one saying that!

88
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,608
Mr. Tanabe?

89
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:12,901
May I go to the bathroom?

90
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:13,894
Fine.

91
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,977
There's gotta be something.

92
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:23,075
Something I can do to embarrass her.

93
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,049
Anything!

94
00:07:24,847 --> 00:07:25,295
Huh?

95
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:29,691
That's it!

96
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,961
I'll write someone's name on Takagi's eraser and make
fun of her for it when she comes back from the bathroom!

97
00:07:35,104 --> 00:07:36,087
Genius!

98
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,193
Just one question:

99
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,026
Whose name should I write?

100
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:41,012
Huh?

101
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:45,401
There's a name on it already?

102
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:51,958
Should I not look, then?

103
00:07:52,381 --> 00:07:54,424
Maybe just a tiny peak.

104
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,875
"Lo"? "Lo"?

105
00:08:01,307 --> 00:08:02,715
Then that means...

106
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:10,139
...it's not my name.

107
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,949
Not that I'm, like, upset or anything.

108
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:34,112
Come on!

109
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,840
I'm gonna look at it!

110
00:08:39,362 --> 00:08:40,861
I have to know!

111
00:08:58,187 --> 00:08:59,517
I can't believe it!

112
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,107
She got me again!

113
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,104
Nishikata, that face was priceless.

114
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:15,460
And man, you acted exactly how I thought.

115
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,632
I just have to tease you.

116
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:21,318
I can't help it.

117
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:25,335
Oh yeah? Well just you wait, Takagi!

118
00:09:25,637 --> 00:09:30,027
Mark my words, one of these days I'm gonna
get back at you and embarrass you so bad!

119
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,829
Like that'll ever happen.

120
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:34,621
You don't think I can do it, huh?

121
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:35,887
Well, yeah.

122
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:37,535
I'm serious!

123
00:09:37,613 --> 00:09:39,523
You better be on your guard.

124
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,206
I think it's impossible.

125
00:09:41,841 --> 00:09:42,976
But keep dreaming.

126
00:09:43,057 --> 00:09:45,197
You can't even win fifty-percent odds.

127
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,226
"Fifty-percent odds"?

128
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,320
Whaddya mean?

129
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:50,952
Not telling.

130
00:09:52,453 --> 00:09:55,349
Man, day duty is such a pain in the butt.

131
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:03,868
Why do I have to go to school early to
clean the blackboard and write a lesson log?

132
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:07,876
I take it back, day duty's awesome!

133
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:10,857
I guess what they say is true.
The early bird gets the worm!

134
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:16,071
I thought this was money, not some stupid arcade token.

135
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,093
<b>"Day Duty"</b>

136
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:27,467
I just got a great idea!

137
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:32,297
I should use this opportunity to rig
Takagi's desk with some kinda prank.

138
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:36,180
Just thinking about it woke me up a little.

139
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:42,490
Ta...

140
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:50,957
My plan is ruined, she's already here.

141
00:10:51,827 --> 00:10:52,767
Wait, why?

142
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,680
I don't see anyone here.

143
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,316
That's weird.

144
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,721
Did I just imagine it or something?

145
00:11:07,123 --> 00:11:09,043
No, she's definitely here!

146
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,997
My Takagi-sense is tingling!

147
00:11:11,301 --> 00:11:13,334
But where is she hiding?

148
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:15,827
And that was a close one.

149
00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:18,962
I was about to let my guard down
and start humming. But not today!

150
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:21,416
Where are you?

151
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:23,507
Show yourself.

152
00:11:29,807 --> 00:11:32,084
You're making this too easy, Takagi.

153
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,714
I can see the name on your shoes under the desk.

154
00:11:35,913 --> 00:11:39,120
You're probably planning to surprise
me when I go up to clean the blackboard.

155
00:11:39,537 --> 00:11:41,288
But I won't give you the chance.

156
00:11:42,531 --> 00:11:43,745
Ahh...

157
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,568
Day duty is such a pain, I don't feel like doing anything!

158
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:51,092
Not like anyone will notice if
I don't clean the board anyway.

159
00:11:51,515 --> 00:11:53,495
Ooo, stings, doesn't it?

160
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:57,527
You must be mortified that this
silly plan of yours didn't work.

161
00:11:59,407 --> 00:12:01,247
I can hardly contain myself!

162
00:12:01,381 --> 00:12:03,575
I wanna see the look on her face so bad.

163
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:04,845
But wait...

164
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:07,905
Would Takagi really make such an amateur mistake?

165
00:12:08,117 --> 00:12:09,695
This is hide-and-seek 101!

166
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:11,964
No!

167
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:13,194
She wouldn't!

168
00:12:13,477 --> 00:12:15,347
Which means that's a trap!

169
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,235
That was close.

170
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:18,881
She's devilish, that one.

171
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,681
Gotta stay on my toes.

172
00:12:21,044 --> 00:12:22,696
So if she's not there,

173
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:23,900
where is she?

174
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:25,902
She's gotta be nearby.

175
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:27,982
She wouldn't miss the opportunity.

176
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:35,116
I don't see her in the hallway,

177
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,549
so there's only one place left.

178
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,323
Welp!

179
00:12:43,576 --> 00:12:45,369
I guess I'll go to the bathroom!

180
00:12:47,436 --> 00:12:49,688
Now pretend I'm not here.

181
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:53,351
I got you!

182
00:12:57,463 --> 00:12:57,966
What?

183
00:12:58,167 --> 00:12:59,549
She's not there!

184
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:01,651
Huh?

185
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,382
Well that was a waste of time.

186
00:13:17,754 --> 00:13:19,715
What the heck was I doing?

187
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:25,961
Hey!

188
00:13:31,957 --> 00:13:32,997
Are you okay?

189
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:33,928
Come on!

190
00:13:33,953 --> 00:13:35,508
I didn't look behind the curtain?

191
00:13:36,117 --> 00:13:37,960
Totally fooled you, didn't I?

192
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:44,396
If you're up real close, you can see through the curtain,

193
00:13:44,421 --> 00:13:45,922
so I saw you the whole time.

194
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,316
Not fair!

195
00:13:47,341 --> 00:13:50,034
She looks so happy! This sucks!

196
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:51,645
Ahh, that was fun.

197
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,422
Just thinking about the look
on your face makes me wanna...

198
00:13:57,936 --> 00:14:00,411
This was worth waking up early for.

199
00:14:00,537 --> 00:14:02,004
Just to mess with me?

200
00:14:02,957 --> 00:14:03,577
Yup!

201
00:14:09,212 --> 00:14:11,646
I can't believe she got me again.

202
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:13,394
Hey, Nishikata.

203
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:13,821
Huh?

204
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,916
Know what?

205
00:14:21,137 --> 00:14:23,797
It's just the two of us in this quiet classroom.

206
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:26,827
Doesn't it feel like we're the only ones in the world?

207
00:14:29,604 --> 00:14:32,828
I think it does, and I hope it stays this way.

208
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,997
Then, uhh, Takagi?

209
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:45,820
Does that mean that you, maybe, like, like...

210
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,785
Good morning everyone!

211
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,556
How about this weather am I right?

212
00:14:52,677 --> 00:14:53,668
Jeez.

213
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:57,357
I'll never understand how you feel
so energetic in the morning, Mina.

214
00:14:57,382 --> 00:15:00,884
Huh? And how else am I supposed to feel, smarty-pants?

215
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:01,751
Tired?

216
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,860
You too, Sanae?

217
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:06,751
Saying you're tired makes your happiness go away!

218
00:15:06,776 --> 00:15:08,238
I saw it on TV!

219
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:10,646
Not everything on TV is true.

220
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:12,356
You can't actually believe that.

221
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:13,665
Well, I do!

222
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:15,646
It's better to be cheerful anywa...

223
00:15:15,671 --> 00:15:16,497
Stop it.

224
00:15:16,522 --> 00:15:17,444
Ow, ow, ow.

225
00:15:17,687 --> 00:15:19,371
That hurts, can you like, not?

226
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:20,834
Just leave her alone.

227
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:23,104
You two would feel better if you smiled!

228
00:15:23,411 --> 00:15:23,938
See?

229
00:15:23,963 --> 00:15:25,373
Ignore them. You were saying?

230
00:15:25,537 --> 00:15:26,126
Huh?

231
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:27,787
It was nothing.

232
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,645
Forget it.

233
00:15:29,517 --> 00:15:30,825
Huuuuh?

234
00:15:32,501 --> 00:15:34,230
Speaking of forgetting things.

235
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:35,637
Did you clean the board?

236
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,712
Ahh! I forgot!

237
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,244
<b>"Funny Face"</b>

238
00:15:51,814 --> 00:15:54,304
How am I gonna pull one over on Takagi?

239
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,251
What am I gonna do?

240
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,052
Think!

241
00:15:58,117 --> 00:15:59,247
Hey, Nishikata.

242
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,251
What are you staring at the mirror for?

243
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:03,495
Oh, hey, Nakai.

244
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:06,407
You practicing' putting on a cool face or something'?

245
00:16:06,604 --> 00:16:07,800
No, that's lame.

246
00:16:10,293 --> 00:16:11,779
A funny face, then?

247
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:15,031
Of course. That's it!

248
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:16,531
So like this?

249
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:20,200
By the way, I've been meaning to ask you something.

250
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:21,859
You're pretty close with Takagi, aren't you?

251
00:16:23,164 --> 00:16:26,028
So I was wondering', like, you into her?

252
00:16:27,674 --> 00:16:31,353
Well, he's clearly ignoring me, which
means I must be on the right track.

253
00:16:31,477 --> 00:16:32,387
Yo, dude.

254
00:16:32,464 --> 00:16:34,754
You totally like Takagi, don't you?

255
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:39,293
That face was so weird, man!

256
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:43,737
I had no idea I had such talent lying dormant within me.

257
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:47,326
Okay, everyone settle down, let's get to work.

258
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,603
Open your books to page 36.

259
00:16:49,628 --> 00:16:50,823
This is perfect!

260
00:16:50,873 --> 00:16:53,080
We just so happen to have the scariest teacher,

261
00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:54,340
Mr. Tanabe, right now!

262
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:59,423
I'll use my funny face to make you laugh
so hard, you'll get in deep trouble, Takagi!

263
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:09,700
Oh man, I wanna make Takagi laugh now.

264
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,308
No. I have to be patient.

265
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:16,484
I have to wait until she starts a
conversation to mess with me, like I planned.

266
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,247
The best moment to mess with someone is when
they're about to mess with someone, themselves.

267
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,220
They'll never expect it then!

268
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,113
And that's when I strike!

269
00:17:25,584 --> 00:17:27,550
All right, girl, come at me.

270
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:29,585
I'm wide open!

271
00:17:30,535 --> 00:17:32,038
Hey, uhh, Nishikata?

272
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,822
Here it is!

273
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:36,336
Whatever do you need, Takagi?

274
00:17:36,396 --> 00:17:37,537
Take this!

275
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:39,093
Huh?

276
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:44,438
Hmmm...

277
00:17:46,313 --> 00:17:47,213
Huh?

278
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:52,703
Hey.

279
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,979
How many times do I have to tell you to be quiet?

280
00:17:57,003 --> 00:17:58,725
I'm sorry! I won't do it again!

281
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:00,773
He's so scary.

282
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,300
This sucks!

283
00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:09,217
I wasn't sure what you were trying
to do at first, but now, I get it.

284
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:11,090
You're not very creative.

285
00:18:11,486 --> 00:18:12,204
Wha?

286
00:18:12,229 --> 00:18:13,936
If you really wanna be funny.

287
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:16,256
You should push your eyebrows up, like this.

288
00:18:16,313 --> 00:18:19,268
Oh, and do this with your cheeks, too.

289
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,542
So like this?

290
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:23,675
Yeah, yeah.

291
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,242
Okay, you're getting there.

292
00:18:25,517 --> 00:18:28,181
Honestly, it's looking better than before already.

293
00:18:28,793 --> 00:18:30,218
What is happening?

294
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,104
Now stick your lips out like a duck bill.

295
00:18:32,148 --> 00:18:33,711
That'll be super funny.

296
00:18:33,736 --> 00:18:36,236
I wanted to make a silly face to make her laugh.

297
00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:39,508
And now I'm getting pointers
on how to do it from my target.

298
00:18:40,097 --> 00:18:41,901
It's kind of humiliating.

299
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:44,021
Whatever!

300
00:18:44,046 --> 00:18:46,611
All I want is for Takagi to laugh and get in trouble!

301
00:18:46,636 --> 00:18:49,206
I couldn't care less who helps me make that happen!

302
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,492
Like this?

303
00:18:51,057 --> 00:18:52,522
Yeah, that's perfect!

304
00:18:53,017 --> 00:18:54,577
It looks way better now!

305
00:18:55,063 --> 00:18:55,983
Okay.

306
00:18:56,137 --> 00:18:58,017
Then why aren't you laughing yet?

307
00:18:58,077 --> 00:19:01,327
I'll laugh really hard if you turn to your left right now.

308
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:02,188
All right.

309
00:19:02,213 --> 00:19:03,173
This is the moment.

310
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:05,392
Here we go!

311
00:19:17,734 --> 00:19:20,594
What are you doing, Nishikata?

312
00:19:20,841 --> 00:19:21,461
Sorry!

313
00:19:21,486 --> 00:19:22,894
I'm really sorry, sir!

314
00:19:24,221 --> 00:19:26,004
Always with the antics.

315
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:28,514
Take my class seriously, will you?

316
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:29,631
I will.

317
00:19:29,656 --> 00:19:30,818
And sorry again.

318
00:19:34,344 --> 00:19:36,155
My stomach hurts from laughing!

319
00:19:36,277 --> 00:19:39,422
I guess I technically got her to laugh, like I wanted.

320
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,409
But she won that round.

321
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,611
Hey. Hey, Nishikata.

322
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,057
Okay, that's enough playing around.

323
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:56,217
If I make Mr. Tanabe angry again, he'll kill me!

324
00:19:56,671 --> 00:20:00,389
I gotta make sure I don't get involved
with Takagi for the rest of this class.

325
00:20:14,277 --> 00:20:16,555
You finally decided to look at me.

326
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,949
We should totally have a staring contest.

327
00:20:26,974 --> 00:20:29,423
One. Two. Three.

328
00:20:34,393 --> 00:20:36,771
That face is so weird!

329
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:37,821
Nishikata!

330
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,679
What did I say?

331
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:45,427
Whenever Takagi gets my heart racing,
things don't play out the way I want them to.

332
00:22:17,762 --> 00:22:19,090
<b>"One Hundred Yen"</b>

333
00:22:23,024 --> 00:22:23,910
Ugh.

334
00:22:24,211 --> 00:22:26,084
I'm exhausted, yet again.

335
00:22:26,131 --> 00:22:27,217
What did I say?

336
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:30,021
Don't say you're tired, it'll make things worse!

337
00:22:30,177 --> 00:22:31,927
It takes your happiness away!

338
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,467
Yeah, whatever.

339
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:44,966
What's up?

340
00:22:45,171 --> 00:22:46,526
Are you doing okay?

341
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:48,250
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

342
00:22:48,437 --> 00:22:49,977
You two go on ahead.

343
00:22:50,097 --> 00:22:50,992
Why?

344
00:22:51,017 --> 00:22:53,146
I'm just feeling a little tired, is all.

345
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,526
By your rules, there goes your happiness.

346
00:22:55,551 --> 00:22:56,252
Huh?

347
00:22:56,997 --> 00:22:58,997
Yeah, guess you're right.

348
00:22:59,097 --> 00:22:59,960
Mina.

349
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,366
Care to tell us what you're hiding under your foot?

350
00:23:03,474 --> 00:23:04,922
Whatever do you mean?

351
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:06,704
I always stand like this.

352
00:23:14,137 --> 00:23:15,717
Wait, no fair!

353
00:23:15,801 --> 00:23:19,592
I found that hundred yen! What
happened to finders keepers?

354
00:23:19,747 --> 00:23:21,292
You are so greedy.

355
00:23:21,997 --> 00:23:22,829
Mina.

356
00:23:23,747 --> 00:23:24,537
Come on.

357
00:23:24,562 --> 00:23:25,828
It's a token.

358
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:31,188
It must have turned into that when I
said I was tired. I told you it was real.

359
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:34,273
You know that's not how the world works.
