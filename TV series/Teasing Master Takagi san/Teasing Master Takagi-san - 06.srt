1
00:00:02,288 --> 00:00:02,868
Well...

2
00:00:02,893 --> 00:00:07,613
As I'm sure you know, summer vacation starts
tomorrow. Try not to get into any trouble.

3
00:00:12,564 --> 00:00:14,515
Summer vacation is gonna be awesome!

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:14,943
Hey.

5
00:00:15,817 --> 00:00:18,015
We're thinking of going to the beach tomorrow, you in?

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,450
Yeah, you know it, dude.

7
00:00:19,526 --> 00:00:22,302
I suddenly have a huge craving for watermelon!

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,555
I'd eat some watermelon.

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,950
Perfect! Let's get one for tomorrow!

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,950
Good idea!

11
00:01:57,276 --> 00:01:58,456
<b>"Tandem Riding"</b>

12
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,118
Summer vacation.

13
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,231
You excited?

14
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,311
Yeah.

15
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:11,911
It feels like I've been waiting for it forever.

16
00:02:12,053 --> 00:02:13,973
Now I can play as much as I want!

17
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:15,108
I'm a free man!

18
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:17,155
You better not forget about your homework.

19
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,232
Knowing you, you'll put it off.

20
00:02:19,316 --> 00:02:21,629
I bet you're thinking "play first, work later."

21
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,080
How'd you know?

22
00:02:23,105 --> 00:02:24,775
Haha! So I was right?

23
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,708
Well yeah.

24
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,225
But the whole point of a break is to relax, right?

25
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:31,643
I wanna go to the pool, hit the
beach, and go camping and stuff.

26
00:02:31,723 --> 00:02:34,293
Man, I barely have enough time to do all that!

27
00:02:35,844 --> 00:02:39,006
I wish we could just have summer vacation forever.

28
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,939
Yeah?

29
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,744
I like going to school, too, though.

30
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,437
Because...

31
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,150
It's fun.

32
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:53,335
No more of that for a while, huh?

33
00:02:54,343 --> 00:02:55,550
So hot!

34
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,532
But the breeze feels great!

35
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,773
Can you go faster? This rocks!

36
00:02:59,798 --> 00:03:02,357
You wouldn't be saying that if you were pedaling!

37
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:08,973
It's hot out.

38
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:17,383
Should we do what they were doing?

39
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,023
Huh?!

40
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,055
Of course, you'd have to be in the front.

41
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,611
No. We can't!

42
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,767
Uh. 'Cuz it'd be dangerous with cars driving by, you know?

43
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:26,475
There are no cars around.

44
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,240
It's not even a public road.

45
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,524
Yeah, but.

46
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:30,927
Hold on.

47
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:32,595
Are you embarrassed or something?

48
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,385
No! Of course I'm not embarrassed!

49
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,080
Oh.

50
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,639
You can't do it, then?

51
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,389
What are you talking about?

52
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:40,330
Tandem riding is super easy.

53
00:03:40,423 --> 00:03:43,308
I just don't think we should do it, 'cuz it's not safe.

54
00:03:45,465 --> 00:03:46,925
Let's go to the vacant lot, then.

55
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,661
Huh?!

56
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,293
If you can't do it, then you owe me a juice.

57
00:03:56,973 --> 00:03:58,595
I hope you're not too thirsty,

58
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,405
because I got this, no sweat.

59
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,333
Hmm?

60
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,250
That was just the practice run!

61
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,510
I can do this!

62
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,805
I'll take grape.

63
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,057
Could ya gimme a second?!

64
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,683
Is it really this hard to ride with
someone sitting on the back of a bike?

65
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:20,845
Just checking, but you're not trying to
throw us off balance on purpose, are you?

66
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,082
Of course not.

67
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,330
Are you sure.

68
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,492
I'm just sitting how I usually sit.

69
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,713
If we can't get it to work, then it's gotta be your fault.

70
00:04:29,343 --> 00:04:30,383
I mean...

71
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,740
...the last time I did this with someone.

72
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,997
They didn't have any trouble peddling.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,804
Oh, really?

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,751
That's cool.

75
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,000
I take it they were a girl?

76
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,040
Nope.

77
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,450
Not a girl.

78
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,690
I see.

79
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,452
One more time.

80
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,159
I think I've almost got it!

81
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:56,309
This time for sure!

82
00:04:56,623 --> 00:04:57,466
What's going on?

83
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,619
Why do I feel so frustrated?

84
00:04:58,644 --> 00:05:00,368
I'm just riding a bike!

85
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,585
What's up?

86
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,833
You're getting into this.

87
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:04,790
I'm not!

88
00:05:04,815 --> 00:05:07,263
I just don't wanna waste my hard earned money on you!

89
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,403
Yeah, that's it!

90
00:05:08,428 --> 00:05:10,523
I just don't want to buy her a drink! That's all!

91
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,050
Hey!

92
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:17,823
We're moving!

93
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,607
By the way, Nishikata,

94
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,635
the last time I rode on the back of someone's bike,

95
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,128
it was my dad's.

96
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:26,385
I think I was four at the time.

97
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:35,492
Take it.

98
00:05:35,517 --> 00:05:37,130
Why, thank you.

99
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,020
Ahh...

100
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,406
That's good!

101
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,352
Are you not gonna get yourself a drink, too?

102
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,465
Uh. Nope.

103
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,618
I'm, uhh, not thirsty.

104
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,353
I can't tell her I have no money to buy my own.

105
00:05:55,453 --> 00:05:56,448
How would that look?

106
00:05:58,579 --> 00:05:59,456
Want some?

107
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:04,548
No.

108
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,177
I'm fine, thanks.

109
00:06:06,356 --> 00:06:09,534
She'd just call it an indirect
kiss again to get me to blush.

110
00:06:10,465 --> 00:06:12,135
Come on, I know you're thirsty.

111
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,882
Have some.

112
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,468
I really don't want any.

113
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,450
Endure it.

114
00:06:19,702 --> 00:06:20,875
You can do it.

115
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:22,586
Endure.

116
00:06:25,804 --> 00:06:26,844
Drink this.

117
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,032
We can't have you getting heatstroke.

118
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:31,383
I can have it?

119
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,283
Yeah.

120
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:35,087
Besides.

121
00:06:35,973 --> 00:06:37,035
I know you.

122
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,750
You don't want mine because it's an indirect kiss.

123
00:06:39,885 --> 00:06:40,551
Huh?!

124
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:43,283
Tha-That's not it!

125
00:06:43,308 --> 00:06:44,615
I'm just not thirsty!

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,762
Right.

127
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,700
But you'll drink yours?

128
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,542
Well, you already bought it.

129
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,582
It'd be a waste when it's this hot.

130
00:06:54,876 --> 00:06:56,170
Thanks for the drink.

131
00:06:59,513 --> 00:07:01,752
We won't be walking home from school for a while.

132
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:02,363
Ahhh...

133
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:03,640
Got that right.

134
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:05,169
We're on vacation, after all.

135
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,130
I know!

136
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:12,376
How about starting tomorrow, we
practice tandem riding here until noon?

137
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,128
Okay, I guess.

138
00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:16,253
But not on the road.

139
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:17,356
That's what I meant.

140
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,608
We'll just ride here.

141
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,341
If we're only ever gonna ride
here, there's no point in practicing.

142
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,783
Yeah, there is.

143
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:26,820
You know.

144
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,440
Summer vacation.

145
00:07:28,846 --> 00:07:30,196
It starts tomorrow.

146
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:33,043
What does that mean?

147
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,459
All right!

148
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,266
Well, we should head home.

149
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,370
Summer vacation.

150
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:42,938
Huh?

151
00:07:43,693 --> 00:07:44,779
I'm excited.

152
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:46,190
It'll be fun!

153
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:48,594
Yeah, obviously.

154
00:07:49,906 --> 00:07:52,225
<b>"First Day of Summer Vacation"</b>

155
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:56,200
Why'd it have to rain on our first day off?

156
00:07:56,247 --> 00:07:57,330
I know.

157
00:07:57,355 --> 00:08:00,950
Summer vacation's barely even
started, and my plans are already ruined!

158
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,840
It's not like it's supposed to rain tomorrow.

159
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:05,160
I wanted to go to the pool today.

160
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,464
And I'm never getting that time back!

161
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:09,236
Please stop crying.

162
00:08:10,703 --> 00:08:13,073
You know we can't do anything about the rain.

163
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,055
Let's just start our homework.

164
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,531
Huh?

165
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:16,039
Huh?

166
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:17,823
What's with those faces?

167
00:08:18,093 --> 00:08:20,498
Don't tell me you two didn't bring yours.

168
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,580
I told you guys to bring your
homework over since it's raining out!

169
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,515
I figured I must have misheard you.

170
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,583
Unbelievable!

171
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,174
Why do we get assigned homework during
summer vacation in the first place?

172
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,890
It's a violation of human rights.

173
00:08:32,992 --> 00:08:34,883
It's hardly a break with homework.

174
00:08:35,023 --> 00:08:36,305
Right?

175
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,526
Dream all you want, we still have to do it.

176
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:53,830
Ugh! Do me a personal favor, Yukari
quit doing your homework and relax!

177
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,200
Seeing you do yours reminds me that I
have to do mine, and now I can't enjoy myself!

178
00:08:58,265 --> 00:08:59,225
Whatever!

179
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,900
Maybe you need the reminder!

180
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,775
It's only the first day still.

181
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,963
Just forget about school.

182
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,941
Typical, from a person who will be
crying with regret on August thirty-first.

183
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:15,467
You're so stubborn.

184
00:09:15,743 --> 00:09:17,515
Forget you. I'm gonna read manga.

185
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:19,759
Yeah?

186
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:20,866
Fine.

187
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:25,351
Hey, Yukari?

188
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,440
Hmm?

189
00:09:27,268 --> 00:09:30,343
I got a great idea. Can we write our book report on manga?

190
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:31,710
Yes, please.

191
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,877
Can you two just go home already?

192
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:38,747
<b>"Test of Courage"</b>

193
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:45,975
It stopped raining.

194
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:46,793
Awesome!

195
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,354
Wait, why exactly am I happy about that again?

196
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:57,435
Nishikata.

197
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,312
You're here.

198
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,561
Yeah, we made a promise, didn't we?

199
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,727
Guess so.

200
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:13,126
Something wrong?

201
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:13,883
Uh.

202
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:14,876
No.

203
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,631
It's nothing.

204
00:10:17,109 --> 00:10:18,059
Whoa.

205
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,913
There are so many puddles here.

206
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:21,515
Well, you know what they say.

207
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,018
When it rains, it pours.

208
00:10:23,243 --> 00:10:25,660
I didn't recognize her for a second there.

209
00:10:26,055 --> 00:10:29,730
Come to think of it, I've run into her
a few times on our days off by chance,

210
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,225
but this is our first time meeting up.

211
00:10:33,703 --> 00:10:34,613
No way!

212
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,657
This isn't like, a date, is it?

213
00:10:36,973 --> 00:10:38,612
No, obviously not!

214
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:41,345
We're just here to practice
tandem riding, like we agreed to!

215
00:10:41,396 --> 00:10:42,462
Nishikata?

216
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:44,638
Huh?! What's up?

217
00:10:45,055 --> 00:10:45,925
You hear me?

218
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,805
Hello?

219
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,253
No. Sorry.

220
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:49,946
What did you say?

221
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,263
This place is in pretty bad riding condition.

222
00:10:53,288 --> 00:10:55,145
Uh, yeah.

223
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,593
Actually,

224
00:10:56,618 --> 00:10:59,399
I was planning to go out after we practiced today.

225
00:10:59,913 --> 00:11:01,363
No sense going back home.

226
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,851
Do you wanna hang out with me to kill some time?

227
00:11:04,941 --> 00:11:05,801
Okay.

228
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:07,019
Is this a date?

229
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,711
No, no, no.

230
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,671
No way!

231
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,548
Uh. Yeah, that's fine.

232
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:15,433
But let's go someplace where there aren't too many people.

233
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:18,613
There's no telling what our
classmates would say if they saw us!

234
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:20,095
Hmmm...

235
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,732
How about...

236
00:11:22,193 --> 00:11:23,378
That's it!

237
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,646
A test of courage?

238
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,394
Perfect for summer, right?

239
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,015
Wouldn't it be scarier if we did it at night?

240
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,197
Not by much.

241
00:11:33,229 --> 00:11:35,532
I heard it gets pitch black when you're in there.

242
00:11:38,725 --> 00:11:41,446
Some say, there's a presence.

243
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,180
Sorry.

244
00:11:42,645 --> 00:11:43,048
What?

245
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,119
A presence?

246
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,674
Well, that's what I heard.

247
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,660
This tunnel doesn't have any sharp turns.

248
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,770
But for some reason, a lot of cars
ended up crashing straight into the walls.

249
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,123
So they had to make a new road nearby.

250
00:11:57,515 --> 00:12:02,742
And since then, every night, without
fail, a bloodthirsty ghost appears.

251
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,875
Looking for cars to prey upon.

252
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,623
But there's even more to it.

253
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
Rumor has it.

254
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:10,299
People are spirited away here.

255
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:11,566
Dozens.

256
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:14,361
Maybe more have disappeared right in this very tunnel.

257
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,144
Are you going in?

258
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,021
Or are you chicken?

259
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:22,761
I am so not chicken!

260
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,412
It's the middle of the day!

261
00:12:24,437 --> 00:12:27,512
Why would I be scared of going
in some dusty, stupid, old tunnel?

262
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,844
It's way darker than I thought.

263
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,865
Why is the wind making such a weird noise?

264
00:12:39,255 --> 00:12:40,095
Hey.

265
00:12:40,153 --> 00:12:41,493
Check out what's on the wall.

266
00:12:42,142 --> 00:12:43,468
A talisman?

267
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,805
For spirits.

268
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,058
It keeps them away.

269
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,653
So clearly,

270
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,368
there must be something evil in here.

271
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:54,983
I'm not surprised you're scared.

272
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,046
I'm not! I was just shocked, that's all!

273
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:57,731
Look!

274
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,861
Uh, great; what is it this time?

275
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:03,061
Weird.

276
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:05,759
I wonder what this steel barrel is doing here.

277
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,212
Uh. Yeah.

278
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:08,720
All right.

279
00:13:08,776 --> 00:13:10,322
I vote you look inside.

280
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:10,870
Huh?

281
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,378
Are you scared?

282
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:15,015
Will you stop saying that?

283
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,800
I'll look.

284
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,855
It's not that big of a deal.

285
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,814
Ah!

286
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,753
That's what I was really worried about!

287
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,616
Takagi?

288
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,370
Takagi?

289
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,123
Where'd you run off to?

290
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,695
Quit messing with me.

291
00:13:57,007 --> 00:14:00,129
Didn't she mention something about being spirited away?

292
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:01,784
But that couldn't...

293
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:03,506
Takagi!

294
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,026
Answer me!

295
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:07,350
Takagi!

296
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,395
What are you freaking out for?

297
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,455
It's just me.

298
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,950
Where'd you come from?

299
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,117
Hey.

300
00:14:21,168 --> 00:14:23,434
You were looking for me just now, weren't you?

301
00:14:24,314 --> 00:14:26,015
Huh? Yeah right.

302
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,053
Why would I do that?

303
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,630
So she lured me in here to jump-scare me a ton.

304
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,500
Whoa.

305
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,511
Look at that.

306
00:14:34,986 --> 00:14:36,363
That's a big hole.

307
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,014
Why don't you take a peek inside it?

308
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,248
Like I'd fall for the same trick twice.

309
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,605
Don't make me laugh!

310
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:45,953
Oh no, I'm stuck!

311
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:47,464
My hand's stuck in the hole!

312
00:14:47,873 --> 00:14:49,425
How do you like my acting?

313
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,515
I've been working on it.

314
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,438
I'm gonna freak you out so bad!

315
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,002
I don't know what, but it feels like
something's pulling me from the other side!

316
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,250
Help me...!

317
00:14:57,317 --> 00:15:00,288
Nishikata.

318
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:03,635
Did I scare you?

319
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,250
No.

320
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,146
What is that?

321
00:15:05,303 --> 00:15:06,974
I dunno, I found it on the ground.

322
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,204
Oh!

323
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:11,564
Glad your hand came loose.

324
00:15:13,553 --> 00:15:14,314
Man.

325
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,211
I gotta find some way to get
her before we leave this tunnel!

326
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,063
As jumpy as usual.

327
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,273
Ahh...

328
00:15:24,817 --> 00:15:26,147
Some fresh air!

329
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,168
This sucks.

330
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:29,267
I couldn't find anything to get her back with.

331
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,805
Must be another couple on a date in the spooky tunnel.

332
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,197
Don't bother them.

333
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,175
Let's go.

334
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,598
Okay.

335
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,259
She called it a "date."

336
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,361
She doesn't know what she's talking about.

337
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,407
Hmm?

338
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,120
What is it?

339
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,584
You're blushing again.

340
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,870
Did you have fun back there?

341
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,196
Because I did.

342
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,182
I guess.

343
00:15:54,843 --> 00:15:56,463
Yeah, but...

344
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,700
It's almost noon, we should go back home soon.

345
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,181
Yeah, let's.

346
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:01,889
What way are you going?

347
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:07,196
You want to go back through there?

348
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:08,209
Yeah, why not?

349
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:09,259
Are you scared?

350
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:10,580
When am I ever?

351
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:19,418
I met my quota for the day.

352
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:21,635
Wait.

353
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,973
It's summer vacation.

354
00:16:23,006 --> 00:16:26,216
Why do I still have just as many push-ups to do as normal?

355
00:16:27,393 --> 00:16:29,430
<b>"Summer Science Project"</b>

356
00:16:30,196 --> 00:16:33,076
Yes, the consommé flavor is quite good.

357
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:33,925
Don't lie.

358
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,190
Your eyes are watering.

359
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:36,555
No, they're not.

360
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,925
And I know it's better than your kelp flavor.

361
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,385
They both sound awful.

362
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,870
There are so many flavors to
choose from. Why would you pick those?

363
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:46,307
You wouldn't understand, miss watermelon.

364
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,000
Take risks while you're still young, right?

365
00:16:49,126 --> 00:16:51,925
That's some philosophy to apply to popsicles.

366
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,080
Hey, did you two decide on
subjects for the science project?

367
00:16:55,106 --> 00:16:56,177
Not yet.

368
00:16:56,202 --> 00:16:57,357
Me neither.

369
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,290
You?

370
00:16:58,632 --> 00:17:00,252
I'm still thinking, too.

371
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,577
Isn't there something easy I can do?

372
00:17:04,664 --> 00:17:06,500
Like, finish-in-a-day easy?

373
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,481
Just do actual research.

374
00:17:08,547 --> 00:17:09,634
Hmm...

375
00:17:10,026 --> 00:17:12,024
A dog observation diary?

376
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,635
Ah! Awesome idea!

377
00:17:13,806 --> 00:17:15,385
That sounds super easy!

378
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,040
And dogs basically behave the same way every day.

379
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,500
So I can just copy the entries and change the dates!

380
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,000
If you're gonna lie, write it by hand at least.

381
00:17:23,131 --> 00:17:25,211
Besides, dogs barely do anything.

382
00:17:25,302 --> 00:17:29,950
They wake up, bark for a walk, bark to
be fed, and sleep every chance they get.

383
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,146
Maybe they'll wake up and bark for attention,
but then they'll just bark for food again.

384
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,441
Why would anyone want to observe that?

385
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,790
You're such a stick in the mud, Yukari.

386
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,870
Well she is the class president.

387
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,660
It comes with the territory.

388
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,253
Right?

389
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,864
Shut up.

390
00:17:46,046 --> 00:17:48,806
Anyway, have you two started to do your homework yet?

391
00:17:51,117 --> 00:17:52,931
We've still got plenty of time.

392
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,476
Right?

393
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,364
Just so you know.

394
00:17:57,389 --> 00:17:58,798
You're not copying mine.

395
00:17:59,876 --> 00:18:02,406
Not even if I do your science project for you?

396
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,186
On a dog?

397
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,226
No, thank you.

398
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:07,763
You say this now, but you're gonna end
up sharing your answers with us anyway.

399
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,580
She wants the class to get good grades.

400
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:11,225
Right?

401
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,908
Maybe I should do an observation
diary on their procrastination habits.

402
00:18:16,464 --> 00:18:17,370
<b>"Water Tap"</b>

403
00:18:19,913 --> 00:18:21,823
So hot.

404
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:25,926
This is the worst day of vacation yet.

405
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:28,660
Are you kidding?

406
00:18:28,685 --> 00:18:30,434
First, I overslept.

407
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:34,386
And then I had a flat tire.

408
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:39,173
But at least all this happened on a
day we're not practicing tandem riding.

409
00:18:39,198 --> 00:18:41,858
Takagi said she was going on a family vacation.

410
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:45,280
When's she coming back from that?

411
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,340
I was gonna stay home for a few hours and
do chores, so I could have the afternoon free,

412
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,770
but of course I was sent on a shopping trip.

413
00:18:52,486 --> 00:18:55,167
Truly this is the darkest of vacations.

414
00:18:55,436 --> 00:18:57,695
That kinda sounded poetic, I should write it down.

415
00:19:01,093 --> 00:19:02,191
That looks like...

416
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:06,406
Yeah, it's Takagi.

417
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,461
Huh.

418
00:19:08,877 --> 00:19:10,262
I guess she's back.

419
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:14,108
I might as well use this opportunity to follow her.

420
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,046
Maybe I can find a weakness to exploit in the future.

421
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,733
Uh oh.

422
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,810
Did she see me there?

423
00:19:36,835 --> 00:19:38,776
Maybe it was my imagination.

424
00:19:40,316 --> 00:19:41,872
No, she did see me!

425
00:19:42,186 --> 00:19:44,866
But I can see her hat sticking out around the corner.

426
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,765
You think you're gonna surprise me, don't you?

427
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,686
Not while I still may breathe!

428
00:19:49,744 --> 00:19:51,214
I should write that down, too.

429
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:00,192
She... She got me!

430
00:20:01,136 --> 00:20:02,222
Going somewhere?

431
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:02,782
Yeah.

432
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,559
Just grocery shopping.

433
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,370
Hey.

434
00:20:05,443 --> 00:20:06,635
What a coincidence.

435
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:08,041
I am too.

436
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,533
We could take your bike, ride tandem?

437
00:20:10,712 --> 00:20:11,534
Come on.

438
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:13,450
We agreed no doing that in the road.

439
00:20:14,282 --> 00:20:16,409
When did she find out I was following her?

440
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,330
Fine.

441
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:18,549
Let's walk together, then.

442
00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:21,079
Oh no! I gotcha!

443
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,498
Are you okay?

444
00:20:26,283 --> 00:20:28,643
And the curse of today continues.

445
00:20:29,939 --> 00:20:31,010
You're hurt.

446
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:33,833
Nah. It's nothing. I'll just let it be.

447
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,234
Don't do that.

448
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:36,881
You should wash it off.

449
00:20:46,087 --> 00:20:47,547
How embarrassing.

450
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,510
Does your knee hurt that much?

451
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,356
No.

452
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,355
It's just that I was already having
a bad day, and now I got a cut, too.

453
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,325
I'm wallowing in how much this vacation sucks.

454
00:20:58,736 --> 00:21:02,475
And it's not like I can write about
my misfortunes for my summer homework.

455
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:03,427
Here.

456
00:21:03,452 --> 00:21:03,868
Huh?

457
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,149
But it'll stain.

458
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:09,196
Don't worry, just take it.

459
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:10,788
Uh.

460
00:21:11,586 --> 00:21:12,388
Thank you.

461
00:21:25,232 --> 00:21:26,736
That feels nice!

462
00:21:27,716 --> 00:21:30,725
So you tried to catch me before, right?

463
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:33,335
Thanks for that.

464
00:21:34,953 --> 00:21:36,212
You should come in.

465
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,160
The cold water's really nice.

466
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,413
Uh, No, I...

467
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:42,332
You know you want to.

468
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:47,411
Cooling you down?

469
00:21:47,689 --> 00:21:48,111
Uh.

470
00:21:50,203 --> 00:21:51,265
You know what?

471
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,672
I had a good day.

472
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,430
Because I got to see someone.

473
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,524
Huh?

474
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,925
Wh-Who do you mean?

475
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,025
You'll get your souvenir tomorrow.

476
00:22:03,515 --> 00:22:04,186
Hey!

477
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,946
Stop that Takagi, the water's really cold!
