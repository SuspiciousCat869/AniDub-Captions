1
00:00:02,426 --> 00:00:03,161
<b>"Coffee"</b>

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,040
Ugh. Bitter.

3
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:12,012
What's going' on with your face?

4
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:12,446
Ugh.

5
00:00:13,277 --> 00:00:15,937
Huh? Wait. Isn't that coffee?

6
00:00:15,962 --> 00:00:17,885
I thought you hated the stuff, Mina.

7
00:00:17,927 --> 00:00:19,893
Why would you buy it you hate it?

8
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:25,220
Well, I'm becoming more of an adult now, so I
thought I should try to get myself used to it.

9
00:00:25,336 --> 00:00:26,473
Huh?

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,045
How exactly are you more of adult now?

11
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,792
Ah! Hey, I may not be tall, but I'm growing in some ways!

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,265
I'd like to see you drink this, Sanae!

13
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:42,264
No problem.

14
00:00:42,337 --> 00:00:43,435
I like it black.

15
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:44,295
Huh?

16
00:00:46,883 --> 00:00:48,800
You like it black?

17
00:00:51,943 --> 00:00:53,854
Do you wanna trade with me, then?

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,813
I do. But I'm an adult, so...

19
00:00:57,838 --> 00:01:01,018
Three, two, one...

20
00:01:01,043 --> 00:01:02,785
Okay, whatever, let's trade!

21
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:03,998
Yes!

22
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,942
Ahhh... So good.

23
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:13,063
You sure you're okay with this?

24
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:13,680
Yeah.

25
00:01:13,705 --> 00:01:16,175
There's gotta be some adults who can't drink coffee.

26
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,180
You know you're a kid right?

27
00:01:19,135 --> 00:01:20,559
Why're you so mean?

28
00:01:21,436 --> 00:01:22,096
Ahh!

29
00:01:22,121 --> 00:01:24,662
Ahhh! Ow!

30
00:01:27,443 --> 00:01:29,207
Oh great.

31
00:01:29,453 --> 00:01:31,958
Adults don't try to tackle their friends, Mina.

32
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:18,009
As I've come to expect, Takagi made fun of me a ton today.

33
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,780
But I'll get her tomorrow!

34
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:30,085
Nishikata.

35
00:03:31,817 --> 00:03:32,680
Takagi!

36
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:35,468
Oh.

37
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:38,055
On your own today?

38
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,878
Yeah.

39
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,130
Cool. Let's walk home together.

40
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:42,457
Uh. Wait, why?

41
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,500
What?

42
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,950
Um, sorry.

43
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:47,897
I thought I heard something.

44
00:03:48,463 --> 00:03:50,521
But, um, you're on your bike, and all.

45
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:52,101
I'll just push.

46
00:03:55,216 --> 00:03:56,048
<b>"Empty Can"</b>

47
00:04:01,486 --> 00:04:03,867
That's that new drink that just came out, isn't it?

48
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:04,853
Is it good?

49
00:04:05,856 --> 00:04:07,019
What is this?

50
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:08,817
Some kind of trap?

51
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:10,025
I like it.

52
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,073
You wanna have a sip?

53
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,330
Can I?

54
00:04:13,396 --> 00:04:13,999
Mm-hmm.

55
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,898
Great. Thank you.

56
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,586
Not that I really mind,

57
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:25,931
but won't it be like we're
indirectly kissing or something?

58
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,420
How's that, Takagi? Super embarrassing, right?

59
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:31,687
You're so embarrassed!

60
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,447
Wha...? How?

61
00:04:35,728 --> 00:04:38,087
She's not embarrassed in the slightest!

62
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:39,754
What is with her?

63
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:40,800
Ahh...

64
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:42,544
Boy, that was good.

65
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:43,603
Thanks again.

66
00:04:52,713 --> 00:04:53,858
Can't drink it?

67
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,029
No. Of course I can drink it.

68
00:04:58,012 --> 00:04:59,077
It's nothing.

69
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,681
No big deal.

70
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:07,083
It's like an indirect kiss.

71
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:07,955
Aah!

72
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:14,919
You're so jumpy.

73
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,613
There's gotta be a trash can around here.

74
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:21,228
Man!

75
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:23,665
Wow!

76
00:05:24,179 --> 00:05:26,182
That was a pretty good shot, Nishikata.

77
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:28,635
I just threw it without thinking.

78
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,432
I didn't expect to make it in.

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,028
This is crazy!

80
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,854
I didn't know I was such a good shot!

81
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:45,814
All right.

82
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,538
I wanna give this a go.

83
00:05:58,249 --> 00:05:59,768
What are you aiming at?

84
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,155
You weren't even close!

85
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,547
You're terrible at this!

86
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,228
Oh? Care to make it interesting?

87
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:07,335
Yeah, fine.

88
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,738
I can't say "no" when winning's a sure-thing.

89
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,062
Then, we'll each throw one can at a time.

90
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:14,359
The first person to make it in, wins.

91
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:19,651
Challenging me to a match she can't possibly win.

92
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,526
Takagi's really lost her cool this time.

93
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,425
And it feels awesome!

94
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,837
So if you somehow win,

95
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,241
then I guess I'll do anything you want me to.

96
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:31,136
I'm gonna hold you to that.

97
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,225
You better not chicken out later.

98
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,593
No way.

99
00:06:34,814 --> 00:06:37,563
Besides, it's not like I'm gonna lose to you.

100
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,098
Glad to hear it.

101
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:52,966
If you miss, that means I win.

102
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,830
Ugh.

103
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,166
She totally tricked me again.

104
00:07:01,223 --> 00:07:04,053
Just stand at the same place and use the same angle.

105
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:07,847
Okay.

106
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,450
I can do this.

107
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:12,242
It's a walk in the park!

108
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:13,837
Oh, yeah.

109
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,647
So, uh, if you happen to win,

110
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:18,938
then I'll let you have my first kiss.

111
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,130
Looks like I win!

112
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,758
That wasn't fair.

113
00:07:35,783 --> 00:07:36,734
What wasn't?

114
00:07:37,605 --> 00:07:40,396
Whaddya mean "what wasn't"? As I threw it, you said...

115
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:42,293
Hmm? Said what?

116
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,926
Oh, forget it.

117
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,088
Okay.

118
00:07:45,113 --> 00:07:46,765
Well, a promise is a promise.

119
00:07:46,823 --> 00:07:49,055
Now what should I make you do?

120
00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:59,103
I don't even want to think about what she might say.

121
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:00,028
Know what?

122
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,714
How about this?

123
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:03,817
You can do whatever.

124
00:08:07,297 --> 00:08:09,285
Wait, where are you going Takagi?!

125
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:12,184
Don't pity me! I need consequences!

126
00:08:12,265 --> 00:08:15,074
Letting me off like this makes me feel
like I'll never beat you at anything.

127
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:16,829
You never will beat me at anything.

128
00:08:16,854 --> 00:08:18,815
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

129
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:19,782
Hey!

130
00:08:22,156 --> 00:08:23,256
<b>"Soda"</b>

131
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:26,600
Ahh!

132
00:08:27,455 --> 00:08:29,015
So fizzy.

133
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,425
What is it this time?

134
00:08:30,503 --> 00:08:32,803
Huh? You're drinking soda?

135
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,213
I thought you didn't like soda, though.

136
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:40,885
Why do sodas have to be so fizzy? It stings!

137
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,870
Is there a reason you keep
buying drinks you don't even like?

138
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,899
Pretending to be an adult again?

139
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:47,422
No, not that.

140
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:49,157
I just love the flavor.

141
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,635
But it stings bad!

142
00:08:53,776 --> 00:08:55,830
My poor tongue is hurting so bad!

143
00:08:55,855 --> 00:08:57,083
You're so annoying.

144
00:08:57,182 --> 00:08:58,069
What?

145
00:08:58,094 --> 00:09:00,882
Don't act like it doesn't hurt
your tongue when you have this stuff!

146
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:01,769
It doesn't.

147
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:03,725
Prove it. Have some right now.

148
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,652
All right.

149
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:08,236
Ahh!

150
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:10,466
The pain'll bubble up inside you soon.

151
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:11,720
Yeah, not likely.

152
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,305
Tell the truth. You're feeling it, aren't you?

153
00:09:22,385 --> 00:09:23,733
No, I'm not.

154
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:24,947
Hmm...

155
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:29,210
What pain is she talking about? I'm fine.

156
00:09:30,496 --> 00:09:31,586
Oh no.

157
00:09:31,626 --> 00:09:33,097
I'm about to burp.

158
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,007
Ha! You feeling' it now?

159
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:35,932
Nuh-uh.

160
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:39,073
If I burp right now, she's gonna make fun of me.

161
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,569
But this stupid fizz is still coming up.

162
00:09:46,843 --> 00:09:50,415
I can't hold it much longer!

163
00:09:53,483 --> 00:09:56,313
Agh! It's so tingly, I hate it!

164
00:09:56,547 --> 00:09:57,413
Ahhh...

165
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,595
What's your problem?

166
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,782
Nothing.

167
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,777
Why am I still drinking this?

168
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:13,361
See you tomorrow!

169
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,590
Just you wait, Takagi.

170
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:25,873
Including the walk home, she
teased me 15 times in total today.

171
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:32,869
Each time I make a mistake
during a game, I make a note of it.

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,619
Then I train ten times harder for each one.

173
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,496
I believe that will lead me to my next victory.

174
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:40,720
That's it!

175
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,200
Today I had 15 losses.

176
00:10:43,345 --> 00:10:45,525
And that times ten is 150!

177
00:10:46,377 --> 00:10:49,397
Uh... That might be too much for my first go.

178
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,765
Okay.

179
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,561
Let's try three times first.

180
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:57,917
One, two, three.

181
00:11:01,722 --> 00:11:02,708
Eighteen.

182
00:11:04,193 --> 00:11:05,255
Nineteen.

183
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,925
This is a lot harder than I thought!

184
00:11:13,026 --> 00:11:14,778
Maybe I shouldn't do so many.

185
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,515
No, I have to!

186
00:11:16,547 --> 00:11:20,184
This is my punishment for letting
Takagi mess with me so many times!

187
00:11:22,343 --> 00:11:28,425
I'll savor this agony and use it as
motivation to get back at her next time!

188
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:30,887
I can do this!

189
00:11:32,695 --> 00:11:33,682
<b>"Muscle Training"</b>

190
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,193
What's wrong?

191
00:11:39,223 --> 00:11:40,213
Is your arm hurt?

192
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:41,130
Pull a muscle?

193
00:11:41,155 --> 00:11:45,039
Huh? Oh, no, it's nothing like
that. It's just extra sore is all.

194
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,554
Huh?

195
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,417
I just said it was sore! That really hurts!

196
00:11:53,006 --> 00:11:55,460
Does that count as her first teasing of the day?

197
00:11:55,703 --> 00:11:58,304
I should probably be holding myself accountable.

198
00:11:58,413 --> 00:12:00,094
So I guess that's one.

199
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,433
Hey!

200
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:06,063
That was way too easy!

201
00:12:06,127 --> 00:12:08,833
You must be really sore if flinching hurts.

202
00:12:09,046 --> 00:12:12,266
Okay, well that was definitely teasing, no doubt about it.

203
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,790
So... wanna tell me why you're sore all of a sudden?

204
00:12:15,823 --> 00:12:18,743
Uhh. I started to work out yesterday, so you know.

205
00:12:18,925 --> 00:12:20,095
Interesting.

206
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:22,427
I hope you don't quit after like, three days.

207
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:24,645
Hah. Go ahead.

208
00:12:24,705 --> 00:12:26,038
Laugh it up now.

209
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,312
Why?

210
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:33,820
She teased me 23 times today! Is that a record?

211
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,710
Either way, it's much more than yesterday!

212
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,810
One, two, three.

213
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:46,913
Hey, whatever happened to working out, Nishikata?

214
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,950
Nothing, I still do it daily.

215
00:12:49,263 --> 00:12:50,345
Oh wow.

216
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,176
So you didn't quit three days in?

217
00:12:53,062 --> 00:12:54,655
Yes, thanks to you.

218
00:12:54,713 --> 00:12:56,424
Oh! But you know what I heard?

219
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,846
Huh? No, what?

220
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,225
They say if you work out too much during your
growth spurt, it'll stop you from getting taller.

221
00:13:02,803 --> 00:13:03,924
Uh, wait?

222
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:06,635
Huh?! Oh no!

223
00:13:06,885 --> 00:13:08,765
I think I did hear that somewhere before!

224
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,886
That's not good!

225
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,750
If she ends ups taller than me because I'm
stunting my own growth, I'll never heard the end of it!

226
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,181
She'll make fun of me forever!

227
00:13:15,243 --> 00:13:17,464
What do I do, what do I do?

228
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:21,225
But that is just a rumor.

229
00:13:21,263 --> 00:13:22,423
Just a rumor?

230
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:27,652
In fact, I've also heard moderate
exercise actually supports your growth.

231
00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:30,951
So, that being the case, you should keep working out.

232
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,424
Nothing to worry about.

233
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,164
It's a good idea.

234
00:13:34,349 --> 00:13:35,450
And to be honest,

235
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,474
you kinda look a bit more muscular.

236
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,973
You think?

237
00:13:44,716 --> 00:13:45,876
What's wrong?

238
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:46,769
You're quiet.

239
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,125
Don't tell me that you're blushing.

240
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:53,145
I'm not blushing.

241
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,368
But your face is red.

242
00:13:57,283 --> 00:13:59,265
Yeah, you're definitely blushing all right.

243
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,515
Why do you always have to tease me every single day?

244
00:14:02,568 --> 00:14:05,292
Because I like seeing your reactions, duh.

245
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:06,432
By the way,

246
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:09,549
I wasn't lying when I said you look muscular.

247
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:12,421
Honestly, you've looked pretty good lately.

248
00:14:14,763 --> 00:14:16,207
You're even redder now!

249
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:18,740
Whatever! It's just because it's hot outside!

250
00:14:18,863 --> 00:14:19,533
Hey!

251
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,602
Takagi!

252
00:14:20,648 --> 00:14:21,690
Come back!

253
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,045
The count is 54 today.

254
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,226
Oh, 55 including this last one.

255
00:14:27,506 --> 00:14:32,065
But I'm starting to think that I should keep
working out even if Takagi doesn't tease me.

Well, I reckon' that depends on work.

eat with Jirou on my way home.

but you should have dinner at home sometimes.

Oh. Okay.

320
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:36,845
It's even more awkward now that I tried to fill
the silence, and it worked for all of five seconds!

321
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,095
Ugh. I'm so embarrassed that it's getting hard to breathe.

322

00:18:28,026 --> 00:18:29,066
Yeah, sort of.

337
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:30,532
It's not that bad, though.

338
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,811
Getting wet at all can lead to a cold.

339
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,966
I'm gonna scoot closer, so get
yourself all the way under the umbrella.

340
00:18:44,283 --> 00:18:46,298
My heart's pounding so fast.

341
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,721
It feels like it's about to burst!

342
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:52,761
Calm down, calm down, Nishikata!

343
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:55,915
If she finds out you're nervous,
she's gonna make fun of you again!

344
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,334
Just talk about something.

345
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,221
Anything!

346
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:02,153
So hey, uh...

347
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,293
Hmm?

348
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:08,049
It's pretty unusual for you to forget
your umbrella when it's supposed to rain.

349
00:19:08,786 --> 00:19:12,168
Could it be that you really are an
airhead, and I was right all along?

350
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:15,443
Was that too harsh?

351
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,698
Hmmm...

352
00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:20,579
Yeah, maybe.

353
00:19:20,777 --> 00:19:22,978
I do tend to be sort of forgetful.

354
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,875
Did I hear that right?

355
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,423
Did she just admit she has a fault?

356
00:19:29,729 --> 00:19:31,149
What a rare occasion!

357
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,520
I feel like I've won for once!

358
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:37,738
I'm having trouble remembering
something right now, actually.

359
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,243
Oh, yeah?

360
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,407
Do you need help?

361
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:41,345
Mm-hmm.

362
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:44,175
The two of us, all close, sharing the same umbrella.

363
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,782
We must look like a...

364
00:19:46,006 --> 00:19:47,804
What was the word for it?

365
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,736
I just can't seem to remember it.

366
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,256
Uhh.

367
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:54,147
Wait, you don't mean...

368
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:56,926
It's on the tip of my tongue!

369
00:19:57,243 --> 00:19:59,579
Uh... We look like a couple?

370
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,353
Huh? What was that?

371
00:20:02,613 --> 00:20:04,530
I didn't quite hear you.

372
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,111
Oh, I remember!

373
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,259
It was "couple"!

374
00:20:12,283 --> 00:20:14,603
Come on, there's no way you forgot that!

375
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,677
Oh, what about that thing that couples do?

376
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,751
You know.

377
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,788
It's a way they express their love.

378
00:20:21,813 --> 00:20:24,514
When they take their lips and then
press them up against each other?

379
00:20:26,323 --> 00:20:28,501
If I don't answer her, then I lose!

380
00:20:29,183 --> 00:20:31,162
A... A kiss?

381
00:20:31,223 --> 00:20:34,133
Huh? I can't hear you, the rain's too loud.

382
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,159
What do you mean?

383
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:37,014
It's not raining that hard anymore.

384
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,965
Hmm?

385
00:20:38,173 --> 00:20:40,102
So don't pretend you didn't hear me.

386
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,330
I said it's a kiss.

387
00:20:42,355 --> 00:20:44,119
Ahh. That was it.

388
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:48,580
So how about that phrase they
always use to show their feelings?

389
00:20:48,605 --> 00:20:49,362
Know that?

390
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,303
You know.

391
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:52,095
That one.

392
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,052
Not I "like" you, but...

393
00:20:55,306 --> 00:20:56,912
Pretty sure it starts out the same.

394
00:20:56,937 --> 00:20:58,412
"I" something.

395
00:20:58,493 --> 00:21:00,372
Uh, I dunno.

396
00:21:00,696 --> 00:21:03,369
I think the next word starts with "L" too.

397
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,042
I said I don't know!

398
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:07,976
Nah, you know this one.

399
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,376
"I"...

400
00:21:10,313 --> 00:21:12,250
The next word starts with "L-O."

401
00:21:15,856 --> 00:21:19,057
"I lo"... What's the next letter?

402
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,334
You know it.

403
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,290
Th-That's enough.

404
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:25,236
Oh! The last word is "you."

405
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:27,540
You're not gonna let up, are you?

406
00:21:28,106 --> 00:21:30,034
Ugh, man!

407
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:41,714
Hey, check it out, the rain stopped!

408
00:21:41,739 --> 00:21:42,957
Yeah, you're right.

409
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:44,565
I'm saved!

410
00:21:45,026 --> 00:21:48,366
There was no way I could survive that
treatment until we reached her house!

411
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,477
Well, my place is this way.

412
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,774
Now that the skies are clear, I'll be going.

413
00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:57,739
Where are we?

414
00:21:57,836 --> 00:22:00,047
I don't know how to get home from here.

415
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:01,432
Ugh!

416
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,413
Will you ever give me a break?
