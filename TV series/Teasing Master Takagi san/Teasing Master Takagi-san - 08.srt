1
00:00:04,326 --> 00:00:06,250
If you're ready, hold on tight.

2
00:00:06,275 --> 00:00:06,901
Sure.

3
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:15,694
When we first started practicing tandem riding,
the hardest part was Takagi holding on to me.

4
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,520
Don't tickle me; you're gonna make us fall over!

5
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:31,115
I wasn't tickling you.

6
00:00:31,343 --> 00:00:32,953
I just held on a little.

7
00:00:35,653 --> 00:00:38,526
But if you thought I was, your ribs are ticklish.

8
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:40,936
It's just because of how your hands are touching them.

9
00:00:41,163 --> 00:00:42,711
Change the way you're holding on.

10
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,252
How's this?

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,700
Don't you think that's a bit too close?

12
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,552
No.

13
00:00:48,623 --> 00:00:50,494
I'll fall if I'm not close.

14
00:00:51,386 --> 00:00:52,344
Oh, come on.

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,817
Don't get self-conscious.

16
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:58,898
I'm not! I'm just overheating when you're right
up against me, it's already a thousand degrees.

17
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,330
Anyway, just do me a favor and don't grab on so tight.

18
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,230
But you literally told me to hold on tight a minute ago.

19
00:01:08,446 --> 00:01:09,476
All right, then.

20
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:11,898
Why don't you just show me how
you want me to hold onto you?

21
00:01:21,503 --> 00:01:22,466
Hurry it up.

22
00:01:22,502 --> 00:01:24,636
We're gonna run out of time to practice.

23
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,900
Uh. I guess something like this works?

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,832
But now we've overcome our hurdles!

25
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,066
And finally...

26
00:01:42,256 --> 00:01:44,236
...we've mastered tandem riding.

27
00:01:44,993 --> 00:01:45,663
Yeah.

28
00:01:46,236 --> 00:01:47,336
Looks like we're done.

29
00:01:50,467 --> 00:01:53,548
I mean, we wanted to learn to ride together, and we did.

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,472
So there's no need to practice anymore.

31
00:01:55,743 --> 00:01:57,900
Uh. Mm-hmm.

32
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:02,405
Are you, by any chance, like, kinda bummed?

33
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,529
Huh?! I dunno.

34
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:05,915
Relieved, then?

35
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:10,173
It'd be rude to say I'm relieved we're done,

36
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:13,338
but if I say I'm bummed out,
she's just gonna tease me even more.

37
00:02:14,336 --> 00:02:16,216
A little bit of both options.

38
00:02:16,263 --> 00:02:17,933
Hey. No fair.

39
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,878
Well, what about you, huh?

40
00:02:20,478 --> 00:02:21,638
What about me?

41
00:02:22,086 --> 00:02:24,710
Well, I'd say I'm not that bummed out.

42
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:27,867
Oh, cool.

43
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:37,849
Tomorrow, let's finish up our homework at the library.

44
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:38,784
Huh?

45
00:02:41,887 --> 00:02:43,520
We can check each other's work.

46
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:45,189
Uh. Okay.

47
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:51,996
Vacation's ending. Real soon.

48
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,757
On the other hand, our next term is starting.

49
00:02:57,369 --> 00:02:58,024
Yeah.

50
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:02,369
I wonder when we're actually getting that typhoon.

51
00:04:37,786 --> 00:04:38,660
<b>"Typhoon"</b>

52
00:04:45,073 --> 00:04:46,746
Oh man, it's so windy!

53
00:04:53,063 --> 00:04:54,762
Whoa, that's really high!

54
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:56,977
This typhoon is crazy!

55
00:04:57,963 --> 00:05:00,873
I don't know why, but I feel really excited!

56
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,750
Now wind, blow harder and harder!

57
00:05:07,527 --> 00:05:08,697
Perfect timing!

58
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,160
I feel like I'm controlling this huge gust!

59
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,477
So awesome!

60
00:05:14,156 --> 00:05:15,185
Now, gale.

61
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,474
I command thee...!

62
00:05:23,997 --> 00:05:25,594
Morning, Nishikata.

63
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,675
Good morning, Takagi.

64
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,603
This wind is really something, huh?

65
00:05:30,987 --> 00:05:33,053
I probably should have tied my hair back.

66
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:35,830
Uh. Yeah, I bet that would have helped.

67
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,650
I was just checking the direction of the wind.

68
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,550
You realize I didn't ask what you were doing.

69
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,743
Come on!

70
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:48,013
Why does she always have to see
me at the worst possible times?

71
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,425
So what were you doing?

72
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,540
I just said, I was checking the direction of the wind.

73
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,450
Weird.

74
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:55,320
That's not what it looked like to me.

75
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,515
"Now wind, blow harder and harder!"

76
00:06:01,373 --> 00:06:03,475
I could have sworn I heard that.

77
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,069
Me? No way, that would just be ridiculous.

78
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,872
Watching someone else do it makes
me realize how embarrassing it is.

79
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,575
So, why were you checking the
direction of the wind, then?

80
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:16,555
I just thought it'd be good to know.

81
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,176
Given that the wind's so strong.

82
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:20,244
So I won't fall over!

83
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:21,317
Yeah?

84
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:24,412
But you had both hands raised up so high.

85
00:06:24,963 --> 00:06:26,613
Like, "Wow!

86
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:29,305
I feel like I'm controlling this huge gust of wind!

87
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:32,107
So awesome!"

88
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:33,767
I'd bet that's what you were thinking.

89
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:36,206
That's even more embarrassing.

90
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:39,816
By the way, do you notice anything different?

91
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:48,506
You're not riding your bike?

92
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:49,071
That it?

93
00:06:49,163 --> 00:06:50,169
Uh-huh.

94
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,305
Question is:

95
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,330
Why do you think I'm not riding it today?

96
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:55,720
Because there's a typh...

97
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,175
If you guess right,

98
00:06:57,203 --> 00:06:59,725
I'll keep quiet about your little performance earlier.

99
00:06:59,756 --> 00:07:01,039
I won't tell a soul.

100
00:07:02,113 --> 00:07:04,833
We've been over this,
I was checking the wind's direction.

101
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:08,137
You have until that plastic bag gets here.

102
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,283
Are you serious? I
have a time limit?

103
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,640
I have no choice but to get this right.

104
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,190
She wouldn't be asking such a simple
question if there wasn't a twist.

105
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,704
So I can rule out anything obvious like,
"It's dangerous to ride a bike in a typhoon."

106
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:24,358
Think. Think!

107
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,700
Some other problem that a strong wind would cause.

108
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:28,415
Bike.

109
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,970
Wind.

110
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,693
Could it be her skirt?

111
00:07:35,762 --> 00:07:37,661
Your... Your...

112
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:42,967
I can't bring myself to say
that out loud! It's too awkward!

113
00:07:45,683 --> 00:07:47,820
And... you are out of time.

114
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:51,876
The correct answer is that it's
dangerous to ride a bike in a typhoon.

115
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:52,506
Sorry!

116
00:07:52,836 --> 00:07:53,406
Huh?

117
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,634
What?

118
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,040
Seriously?

119
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:58,073
You read into things too much.

120
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,620
Okay.

121
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,794
Let's get going.

122
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,349
This wind is so strong.

123
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,275
Yeah.

124
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:20,049
Kinda gets you excited, doesn't it?

125
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,332
Yeah. I mean, I don't really
know what you're talking about.

126
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,494
Hmm?

127
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:27,135
Come on.

128
00:08:27,295 --> 00:08:28,975
Doesn't it make you want to shout?

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,830
Raise your hands to the sky!

130
00:08:32,165 --> 00:08:34,472
"Now wind, blow harder and harder!"

131
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:36,549
This sensation!

132
00:08:36,574 --> 00:08:38,926
It's like I'm controlling the storm!

133
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:44,015
I am the great Wind King, ruler of this world!

134
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,699
I shall blow the school away
to the far ends of the earth!

135
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:52,599
Hey, I never went that far!

136
00:08:57,729 --> 00:09:00,135
So you weren't just checking the wind's direction.

137
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,262
Uh...

138
00:09:01,495 --> 00:09:02,407
Well, whatever.

139
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:05,455
Let's race to school!

140
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,262
Hurry up!

141
00:09:07,817 --> 00:09:08,777
So strong!

142
00:09:08,802 --> 00:09:10,985
Huh? Wait up, Takagi!

143
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:12,500
You always try to get a head start!

144
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,052
For some reason,
Takagi was really energetic this morning.

145
00:09:20,547 --> 00:09:21,470
<b>"Marathon"</b>

146
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,095
All right!

147
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,223
Let's do this!

148
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,225
How are you so full of energy?

149
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,095
I thought you hated marathons.

150
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,830
Nah.

151
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,235
I'm looking forward to it!

152
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,250
In fact, let's race, Sanae!

153
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,210
Okay.

154
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,742
How about if I win, you don't get to eat any lunch?

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,950
Yeah.

156
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,410
Bring it on!

157
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,635
Wait. You sure?

158
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,345
You know Sanae is really fast, don't you?

159
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,975
Yeah, but I'm in the zone!

160
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,756
Uh-huh...

161
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,521
What's the point of running a marathon?

162
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,730
It's not like we're ever gonna run this
much after we're finished with school.

163
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,385
It doesn't make any sense.

164
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,455
So lame.

165
00:10:00,717 --> 00:10:02,203
You said it, dude.

166
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,643
You look enthusiastic, Nishikata.

167
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:09,559
Nishikata.

168
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,420
You sure you're up to this?

169
00:10:14,493 --> 00:10:16,395
Ha! 'Course I am.

170
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,525
It was my idea to begin with.

171
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,380
'Kay.

172
00:10:19,867 --> 00:10:21,253
See ya later!

173
00:10:23,683 --> 00:10:26,103
You and Takagi sure are close.

174
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:27,667
Huh?!

175
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,447
Are you going out with her?

176
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,900
What are you talking about?

177
00:10:30,953 --> 00:10:32,747
Don't get the wrong idea, Kimura!

178
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:36,900
I'm only competing with her because the
winner gets to order the loser around!

179
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,900
Wait. You're racing each other in the marathon? But...

180
00:10:39,925 --> 00:10:41,485
It's none of your business.

181
00:10:43,072 --> 00:10:47,052
Judging by that reaction,
I wouldn't put money on the two of them going out.

182
00:10:47,282 --> 00:10:49,742
Yeah, I mean, if they were going out...

183
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:53,055
Nakai! How are you feeling?

184
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,242
Pretty darn good!

185
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:57,462
And it's all thanks to you
training with me every single day!

186
00:10:57,986 --> 00:10:59,986
Let's destroy this marathon!

187
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,093
Yeah!

188
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,556
They'd be acting something like that.

189
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,383
All right, gather 'round!

190
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,167
I'll never understand why we have to do this.

191
00:11:14,276 --> 00:11:16,606
Just accept it already, Kimura.

192
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,720
Empty your mind.

193
00:11:27,107 --> 00:11:29,115
Run with an empty mind.

194
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:33,065
Calm yourself and avoid wasting unnecessary energy.

195
00:11:37,062 --> 00:11:39,519
I've got you this time, Takagi.

196
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:43,372
I've jogged every evening for
over two weeks just for this day!

197
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,750
Come rain.

198
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,634
Come wind!

199
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:51,326
There's no way I'm gonna lose after all that prep.

200
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,676
Oh! Empty your mind.

201
00:11:56,013 --> 00:11:57,631
Empty your mind.

202
00:11:59,462 --> 00:12:00,995
Hey, Nishikata!

203
00:12:02,236 --> 00:12:04,834
I figured you would have sprinted way ahead of the pack.

204
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,995
Oh yeah?

205
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,390
Sorry, but pacing yourself is the key.

206
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,150
But clearly you don't get it.

207
00:12:12,093 --> 00:12:16,677
You look unfazed, but you sped up because you
couldn't see me ahead of you and panicked, right?

208
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,620
Hmm?

209
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:22,299
I was running slow until now because
I wanted to give you a handicap.

210
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,926
Handicap?

211
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,646
Wait, did she just read my mind?

212
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,005
Well, I'm going on ahead.

213
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:28,813
Huh?

214
00:12:36,192 --> 00:12:38,560
I can't have lunch.

215
00:12:38,613 --> 00:12:40,433
And I'm already so hungry.

216
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,040
I started out too fast.

217
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,708
That's right.

218
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:46,095
You'll see, Takagi.

219
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,390
If you keep running that fast,
you're gonna lose your pace just like her!

220
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:52,193
And all I have to do is keep up my pace.

221
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,578
Wait.

222
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,300
But what if Takagi is actually
good at running marathons?

223
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:01,616
If she is, I'm screwed!

224
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:04,666
I don't have the time to empty my mind!

225
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:08,775
Is she already running back?

226
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,883
She's that much faster than the boys?

227
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:24,339
I lost my pace, but I caught up.

228
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:29,813
If you manage to touch me,
then you can be the winner.

229
00:13:37,823 --> 00:13:40,045
I can't touch her in front of all these people!

230
00:13:40,107 --> 00:13:41,985
Who knows what they'd think was going on?

231
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:44,949
Takagi, you sneaky little...

232
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,293
You deliberately made me lose my pace!

233
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,147
Ugh...

234
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,745
Takagi.

235
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,700
I'll give you a different win condition, too.

236
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,477
If you can run 50 meters ahead of
me, the crown is yours!

237
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,524
You mean that?

238
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,509
Hook, line, and sinker!

239
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:05,743
I hope you're ready!

240
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,404
Because I'm gonna destroy your pace this time!

241
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,905
You're finished!

242
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:10,707
Cool!

243
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,625
I win, then.

244
00:14:12,113 --> 00:14:14,193
All the girls are supposed to turn back here.

245
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,330
Good luck!

246
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,430
You boys still need to run two more kilometers.

247
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,286
Oh, that is so not fair, Takagi!

248
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:24,461
That's why I asked if you were sure!

249
00:14:24,486 --> 00:14:27,516
We're recording your time Nishikata. Don't stop running!

250
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:36,616
What'd I say?

251
00:14:36,763 --> 00:14:39,253
Your sides start to hurt and you get hungry.

252
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:44,230
As far as I'm concerned, absolutely nothing
positive comes from running a marathon.

253
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:49,830
If you used all that energy to run instead of
complaining, you might be able to go a little faster.

254
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,200
Why would I do something so pointless?

255
00:14:52,502 --> 00:14:56,372
You really think running is
more pointless than complaining?

256
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,050
I just wanna eat lunch.

257
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:01,548
I'm hungry too.

258
00:15:01,573 --> 00:15:03,058
I'm starving.

259
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:12,325
<b>"Ribs"</b>

260
00:15:14,512 --> 00:15:17,052
Takagi messed with me a ton today.

261
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:18,039
Again.

262
00:15:18,803 --> 00:15:19,763
Man.

263
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,312
You'll get yours.

264
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:22,727
What's up?

265
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,260
Stop staring.

266
00:15:26,424 --> 00:15:27,601
I can't get over that.

267
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,167
You have such ticklish ribs!

268
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,790
She does this every time there's an opportunity.

269
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,885
Yeah, sure, my ribs are ticklish.

270
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,015
But aren't everybody's?

271
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,250
I'm not special.

272
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,040
Hey, Takagi.

273
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,521
Hmm?

274
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,310
Wanna make a bet?

275
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:45,506
I'm thinking whichever one of
us laughs first is the loser.

276
00:15:45,896 --> 00:15:47,197
Yeah, why not?

277
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:50,343
If it's all the same to you,
I'd like to start right now.

278
00:15:50,526 --> 00:15:51,137
Okay.

279
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,617
I've got you now!

280
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,456
You have no idea what I've got in store, do you?

281
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,152
Looks like both your hands are
occupied holding your bike.

282
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:00,950
Too bad.

283
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,346
You're at a disadvantage.

284
00:16:02,825 --> 00:16:07,597
If you think you can protect your ribs with
only your elbows you've got another thing coming!

285
00:16:07,693 --> 00:16:09,210
Oh. By the way,

286
00:16:09,904 --> 00:16:13,285
so you know, my ribs happen to not be ticklish.

287
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,877
Made you look!

288
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,747
Wow. No laugh?

289
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,282
That was too close for comfort.

290
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:31,663
And did she say she's not ticklish?

291
00:16:31,763 --> 00:16:33,776
That's a bluff if I've ever heard one.

292
00:16:34,156 --> 00:16:35,716
She's wide open!

293
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,316
Then could she be telling the truth?

294
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,018
No.

295
00:16:42,343 --> 00:16:46,110
My best option remaining is to just
go for it and find out that way.

296
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,358
Is something wrong?

297
00:16:52,453 --> 00:16:53,286
Huh?

298
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:56,992
All good. It's, uh, nothing.

299
00:16:58,953 --> 00:17:01,573
This is kinda embarrassing.

300
00:17:01,843 --> 00:17:03,963
Should I really touch her like that?

301
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:07,100
Wouldn't it be sexual harassment?

302
00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:09,577
Hmm?

303
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,938
Better hurry up, or I'll get you again.

304
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:14,578
Huh?!

305
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:18,832
What the heck?

306
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:21,440
I thought I had the perfect plan all worked out.

307
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,842
How did I not realize it had such a pitfall!

308
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,045
It's too risky to go through with.

309
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,475
I'll keep my distance and maybe this can end in a draw.

310
00:17:41,671 --> 00:17:43,451
That face isn't fair!

311
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:45,786
I win.

312
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:50,946
I'm really dropping the ball today.

313
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:54,786
I can't believe I forgot that
Takagi makes such good funny faces.

314
00:17:56,296 --> 00:18:00,966
Well then, what should I make you do this time?

315
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:03,661
Huh? There's a penalty for the loser?

316
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,414
You said, "Wanna make a bet."

317
00:18:05,506 --> 00:18:06,981
Of course there is!

318
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:09,966
Now, let's see...

319
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,094
You can't eat rice for the rest of your life.

320
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:14,994
Huh?

321
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:16,935
That's brutal!

322
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,641
Don't worry, I'm just kidding.

323
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,661
You can't read <i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

324
00:18:25,716 --> 00:18:26,581
Huh?

325
00:18:28,662 --> 00:18:30,384
That's pretty cruel, too.

326
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,264
Well how about this, then?

327
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:39,151
You have to poke my ribs.

328
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,286
Uh?

329
00:18:43,302 --> 00:18:45,842
Uhh. Wait, that's my punishment?

330
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:46,857
Mm-hmm.

331
00:18:47,546 --> 00:18:48,779
Okay, then.

332
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:54,834
Hmm?

333
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
That's it!

334
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,146
I see what's going' on here!

335
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,370
She wants to enjoy me getting
embarrassed and struggling to touch her.

336
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,598
Not on my watch!

337
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,890
Come to think of it.

338
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:13,059
This might actually be the first
time I've ever touched her.

339
00:19:13,396 --> 00:19:15,125
Anywhere but her shoulder, I mean.

340
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,580
No, don't think about it.

341
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,725
You're just poking her!

342
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,414
It's not a big deal!

343
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,109
You okay?

344
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,500
See?

345
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,478
Told you.

346
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,588
My ribs aren't ticklish in the slightest.

347
00:19:36,202 --> 00:19:37,156
Yeah.

348
00:19:45,006 --> 00:19:47,136
My armpits are pretty ticklish, though.

349
00:19:49,846 --> 00:19:52,008
I definitely can't touch her there!

350
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,131
<b>"Regret”</b>

351
00:20:00,836 --> 00:20:02,256
I totally forgot!

352
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:03,153
About?

353
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,095
This is absolutely terrible!

354
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,395
What's terrible?

355
00:20:06,487 --> 00:20:10,340
We didn't do our test of courage over the summer... ah...

356
00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:13,944
Oh yeah, I guess we didn't.

357
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,896
Let's do it today after school!

358
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:16,830
We just gotta!

359
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,105
Uh, I guess that's okay.

360
00:20:26,345 --> 00:20:28,305
You feel that? It's so haunted!

361
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,384
Ooooh...

362
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,450
Are we really going in there?

363
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:33,312
Yes!

364
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:38,636
They're too excited for this to be a test of courage.

365
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,845
It's so dark!

366
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,488
Uh-huh.

367
00:20:43,513 --> 00:20:44,395
Oh!

368
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,805
A hole!

369
00:20:48,742 --> 00:20:49,572
Oooh.

370
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,055
Huh? A paper talisman!

371
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,425
For the spirits!

372
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,110
Yeah.

373
00:20:55,006 --> 00:20:56,006
Look at that!

374
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,235
What's a steel barrel doing in here?

375
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:58,826
Uhh?

376
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,228
This isn't scary at all.

377
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,076
What? No.

378
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,155
It's super scary!

379
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,027
Yeah, no.

380
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,233
Whoa, look!

381
00:21:13,465 --> 00:21:15,183
I found a Frisbee!

382
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,000
Lucky!

383
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,836
That's weird to find this deep in.

384
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,488
It's kinda chilly in here!

385
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:20,728
You think it's a ghost?

386
00:21:20,753 --> 00:21:23,225
No, we're just out of the sun
and the wind is blowing through.

387
00:21:23,835 --> 00:21:25,527
This is so fun!

388
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,370
Oooo!

389
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,392
Whaddya doing; don't chase me!

390
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,123
Are you happy we did it?

391
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,225
Mm-hmm.

392
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:44,925
It was such a classic summer vacation adventure!

393
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,896
Sure, whatever that means.

394
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,756
But it sucks.

395
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,319
Summer vacation isn't coming back any time soon.

396
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,260
Yeah.

397
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,620
I'm not used to you being so bummed out Mina.

398
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:03,103
Talk about a downer.
