1
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,799
There's gotta be some way I can
beat Takagi at her own game.

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,930
I gotta get that last laugh!

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,055
Or, at the very least, I have to do something
to stop her from teasing me every day.

4
00:00:21,358 --> 00:00:22,830
Sorry, I didn't see you...!

5
00:00:27,466 --> 00:00:28,572
Hey, Nishikata.

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,871
Good morning.

7
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:34,035
Oh. Ah. Good morning.

8
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,190
Uh. Something wrong?

9
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:36,796
Oh, no.

10
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,203
Not at all.

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,451
Hmm...

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,666
Well, you want to go to school together?

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,513
Uh...

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,355
Sure.

15
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:18,336
<b>"Who's Taller?"</b>

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,243
Did she see that?

17
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,745
Did she see me apologize to a pole?

18
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,975
Hey, Nishikata.

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,549
Yeah? What's up?

20
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:32,672
Want to tandem ride?

21
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:34,609
You already know my answer.

22
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,058
We'll get in trouble if we're seen.

23
00:02:37,563 --> 00:02:39,202
You're just too embarrassed.

24
00:02:39,303 --> 00:02:40,675
No, I am not!

25
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:42,141
Yeah. Right.

26
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,573
Well, she hasn't said anything strange.

27
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,740
Guess she must have just missed seeing me.

28
00:02:48,276 --> 00:02:48,832
Phew.

29
00:02:51,316 --> 00:02:52,452
Took you long enough.

30
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,260
Breaking out the winter uniform?

31
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,525
Yeah. It's been getting colder lately,
so I thought the time was just about right.

32
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:01,474
Wh-What?

33
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:03,925
Did you grow?

34
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,580
Huh?

35
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,422
I think that uniform looked a
little bigger on you last spring.

36
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:12,099
Now that I think about it, she might be right.

37
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,200
This thing feels like it was tailor-made for me.

38
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,313
I didn't even notice.

39
00:03:17,103 --> 00:03:18,001
Could it be?

40
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,700
Am I finally having a growth spurt?

41
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,213
Man.

42
00:03:24,397 --> 00:03:27,663
I'm growing so much lately,
I might need a new uniform soon.

43
00:03:27,843 --> 00:03:29,792
Must be one of those "growth spurts."

44
00:03:30,283 --> 00:03:33,863
But by comparison, you sure haven't
changed much, have you, Takagi?

45
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:40,894
That's sexual harassment.

46
00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:44,144
"Haven't changed much."

47
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:47,242
N-No!

48
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,315
That's...

49
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,923
Come on, you know that's not what I was talking about.

50
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,389
Uh. I was talking about your height.

51
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,358
Huh? Well, yeah, I was too.

52
00:03:57,669 --> 00:03:59,399
Why, what did you think I meant?

53
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:04,613
N-Nothing.

54
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,868
Oh?

55
00:04:07,202 --> 00:04:08,618
Now what?

56
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,631
Hmm...

57
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,174
You know what?

58
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,752
I take it back, maybe you haven't gotten taller.

59
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:16,432
Huh?!

60
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:17,735
What do you mean?

61
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,902
I totally grew!

62
00:04:19,163 --> 00:04:22,272
In fact, I'd be willing to bet
I'm taller than you now, Takagi!

63
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:27,206
Yeah? Do you care to find out for sure?

64
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,114
Why're we doing it here?

65
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,420
So we can take our shoes off to be fair.

66
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:41,473
We're gonna be late for school.

67
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:42,595
Nah, this'll be quick.

68
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,844
Here, turn around.

69
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:54,689
Let's see.

70
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:58,647
She's kinda... warm.

71
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:00,971
Uhh...

72
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,040
So, Takagi?

73
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:04,870
Huh?

74
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:09,889
Normally, wouldn't you stand against a
wall and make a mark to measure height?

75
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:13,287
Yeah, but I think it's more accurate
if we stand together like this.

76
00:05:18,336 --> 00:05:20,015
I think we're about the same height.

77
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,348
Huh? Really?

78
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:23,428
Really.

79
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:25,364
If you don't believe me, check for yourself.

80
00:05:31,493 --> 00:05:32,748
No way, you're right.

81
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,870
Told yah.

82
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:35,627
Hey.

83
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:38,062
You're not like, on your tiptoes are you?

84
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,484
Why? You don't trust me?

85
00:05:41,436 --> 00:05:42,499
All right then.

86
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,790
Is this better?

87
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,936
You'll be able to tell if I'm cheating now.

88
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,053
Uh. Yeah. I guess.

89
00:06:04,157 --> 00:06:04,805
Wait.

90
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,360
Now it kinda looks like.

91
00:06:06,693 --> 00:06:07,698
I'm taller.

92
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:10,064
That's because I was on my tiptoes before.

93
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,645
So you were cheating, I
called it! You're a liar!

94
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:16,833
I never said I wasn't on my tiptoes.

95
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,973
Good for you though.

96
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,510
You're taller after all.

97
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:23,410
Yeah, walk away.

98
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,348
You're acting all cool on the outside,
but on the inside, I bet you're really bitter!

99
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:30,417
Oh. By the way,

100
00:06:30,442 --> 00:06:32,249
if you think I'm bitter, you're wrong.

101
00:06:33,355 --> 00:06:34,512
Know why?

102
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,482
When your body grows too fast.

103
00:06:36,507 --> 00:06:37,725
You might run into things.

104
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,571
Like, utility poles.

105
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,284
Huh?

106
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,290
Wait! Does that mean you saw me do that?

107
00:06:50,315 --> 00:06:51,095
Are you ready?

108
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,135
School's a-waiting'!

109
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,029
Takagi.

110
00:06:53,923 --> 00:06:54,693
Hey.

111
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,980
Takagi?

112
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,775
So cold.

113
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,210
I dunno, I feel fine.

114
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:15,800
You're so sensitive to the cold, Yukari.

115
00:07:16,323 --> 00:07:17,363
Take that!

116
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,222
Mina, your hand is freezing!

117
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,593
<b>"I Hate the Cold"</b>

118
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,429
Jeez.

119
00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:34,043
You do that again, and I'll hate you forever.

120
00:07:35,197 --> 00:07:36,130
Forever?

121
00:07:38,353 --> 00:07:39,723
Will you stop it?

122
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,809
Why?

123
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:42,475
Because I hate it!

124
00:07:42,506 --> 00:07:44,521
Why are your hands so cold anyway?

125
00:07:45,707 --> 00:07:46,847
You know why.

126
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:49,309
You just don't want to accept it.

127
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,322
People who have cold hands have warm hearts!

128
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,828
I don't think a person with a warm heart
would enjoy torturing their friends for kicks.

129
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:57,935
Now, now.

130
00:07:58,146 --> 00:07:59,875
There's no need to hold a grudge.

131
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:04,841
I'm not kidding. If you do it
again, I'm gonna be really mad.

132
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:06,201
You're already mad.

133
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:07,227
Gotcha.

134
00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:09,306
So cold!

135
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,753
Stop it!

136
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,015
I said stop, Sanae!

137
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,133
That's the "My heart is so warm" attack.

138
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:17,515
Help me, Yukari!

139
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:20,605
Take this!

140
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,900
Now let's see how you like it!

141
00:08:27,343 --> 00:08:30,118
Your hands are so warm. It's scary.

142
00:08:30,658 --> 00:08:32,930
That must mean you've got a cold heart.

143
00:08:33,486 --> 00:08:35,725
That is not what it means and you know it!

144
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,389
Stay away, cold-heart!

145
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:40,106
Prepare for the "Cold heart frozen soul" attack!

146
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,015
Equally as fearsome!

147
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,592
It's not even close!

148
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:44,287
Hey.

149
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,420
So cold!

150
00:08:46,223 --> 00:08:47,729
What'd you do that for?

151
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,193
Get me back if you can.

152
00:08:54,728 --> 00:08:56,660
You get back here!

153
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,677
Stop that!

154
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:00,620
Quadruple cold hands!

155
00:09:02,203 --> 00:09:03,815
Four times the power!

156
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,427
No way can I do that.

157
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:14,005
Will you stop it?! Your hands
are cold as ice! Leave me alone!

158
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,670
Did you know they say that people
with cold hands have warm hearts?

159
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,425
Nope!

160
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,410
It's Takagi and Nishikata, again.

161
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,040
I saw them show up to school together today.

162
00:09:28,113 --> 00:09:30,035
Those two are so close.

163
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:33,097
Well, maybe they are going out.

164
00:09:37,062 --> 00:09:38,396
<b>"Invitation"</b>

165
00:09:40,243 --> 00:09:42,317
I really can't help but wonder.

166
00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:44,206
Do you think they're going out?

167
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,780
Who knows?

168
00:09:45,913 --> 00:09:47,663
You don't sound very interested.

169
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,020
They're so close, it makes me want to know.

170
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,950
Why is that?

171
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,487
Are you jealous of them?

172
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,830
Am I jealous?

173
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,895
Well, not exactly, but...

174
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,012
Mina.

175
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,932
Yukari says she wishes she had
a boy she could flirt with.

176
00:10:01,957 --> 00:10:03,870
That's not even close to what I said!

177
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:04,875
Hey.

178
00:10:05,053 --> 00:10:06,020
You listening?

179
00:10:07,397 --> 00:10:08,298
Mina?

180
00:10:08,368 --> 00:10:11,944
Sanae! I'm on the toilet.
Don't talk to me right now, please!

181
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:14,790
You're gonna make me lose my concentration!

182
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,387
Huh?

183
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,450
You are too much sometimes, Sanae.

184
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,700
It's good.

185
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:21,106
You should watch it later.

186
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,750
Really? Cool, I will!

187
00:10:22,783 --> 00:10:23,765
Hey, Takagi?

188
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,288
Hmm?

189
00:10:29,782 --> 00:10:32,324
I just came up with the perfect plan!

190
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:37,800
It's the ultimate, fail-proof plot to
tease Takagi on our way home from school!

191
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,643
Hmm?

192
00:10:41,743 --> 00:10:44,613
What are you smirking to yourself about over there?

193
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,775
Something pervy?

194
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,600
No.

195
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,719
It's nothing dirty or weird or whatever.

196
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,380
Dirty or weird?

197
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,374
That's what I said!

198
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:54,831
Your face is turning red.

199
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,610
Whatever.

200
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,370
Just you wait until after school!

201
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,918
By the way, Nishikata.

202
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,780
Later, do you wanna walk home together?

203
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,810
Yeah, sure!

204
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:10,140
Oh, no!

205
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,626
Was I too eager?

206
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,450
Did she realize I'm up to something?

207
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,767
I mean.

208
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,906
Yeah, sure.

209
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,606
Isn't that what you just said?

210
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,675
Uh-huh.

211
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:22,272
That a problem?

212
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,175
Hmm...

213
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,428
No.

214
00:11:25,563 --> 00:11:28,765
But just in case you change
your mind before school's out,

215
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,176
you can give me a definite answer later.

216
00:11:32,236 --> 00:11:32,973
See ya.

217
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:40,589
Well that was weird.

218
00:11:40,762 --> 00:11:43,476
As long as she isn't on to me, I guess it's fine.

219
00:11:43,946 --> 00:11:45,076
Hey, Nishikata!

220
00:11:46,225 --> 00:11:48,765
We were gonna play "Super-Pro" at my house today.

221
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,855
You want in on that?

222
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:50,975
Um...

223
00:11:52,255 --> 00:11:54,175
Sorry. I can't today.

224
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,790
You spending time with your girlfriend again?

225
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:57,945
My "girlfriend"?

226
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,080
Takagi, right? I called it.

227
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,435
Huh?! What are you talking about?

228
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,092
We're not like that at all!

229
00:12:04,117 --> 00:12:07,460
It's true, Takagi and Nishikata are not going out.

230
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:10,633
I know 'cuz we just asked her in the bathroom.

231
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,595
Aw, really?

232
00:12:11,675 --> 00:12:12,274
Yeah!

233
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,305
Oh man, I seriously gotta go.

234
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,136
Bathroom, here I come.

235
00:12:17,886 --> 00:12:22,185
Uhh... What was she doing in the
bathroom before if she has to go now?

236
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:28,046
All right, putting that aside,
if you're not going out with her,

237
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,822
why are you walking home with
her for like the hundredth time?

238
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:33,277
Well, because she asked me to?

239
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,280
Asked you?

240
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,470
And you're sure that's not because you're going out?

241
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,019
Uh.

242
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:40,030
I don't think so, at least.

243
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,097
Hmm?

244
00:12:43,323 --> 00:12:44,782
Okay, whatever.

245
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,433
Hey, isn't next period in the lab?

246
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,701
You're right, let's hurry!

247
00:12:56,846 --> 00:12:57,756
No way.

248
00:12:57,979 --> 00:12:58,808
I don't buy it.

249
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,570
Takagi just wants to tease me.

250
00:13:04,814 --> 00:13:06,230
Ready to get going?

251
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,265
Yeah. But we're going straight home today, okay?

252
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:09,983
Huh?!

253
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,015
But I had it all planned out!

254
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:14,191
I wanted to get a Ponkan Popsicle!

255
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,345
Don't you think it's a little bit cold for that?

256
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,830
Not when you go inside and pump the heat it's not!

257
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,650
You said it.

258
00:13:21,823 --> 00:13:24,093
If she's not gonna say anything about it,

259
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,606
then to give her my "definite"
answer, I've gotta ask her myself.

260
00:13:29,203 --> 00:13:32,098
That's kinda embarrassing now
that I'm face to face with it.

261
00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:35,437
I've never been the one to ask
her to walk home with me before.

262
00:13:36,263 --> 00:13:37,423
Nishikata.

263
00:13:37,956 --> 00:13:39,469
Yeah? What's going' on?

264
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,329
Oh, good!

265
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,660
If she asks me, all I have to do is say yes!

266
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,595
That's easy!

267
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:45,798
You know what?

268
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:49,057
Earlier today someone asked me
if I was going out with you.

269
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,372
Huh?!

270
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,578
And...

271
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,475
After I told them we weren't,

272
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,535
they said that they thought I liked you.

273
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,632
I'm always asking you to walk home with me.

274
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:00,674
Maybe that's why they thought that.

275
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:03,749
I should have known!

276
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:05,805
This is what you were after the whole time!

277
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,679
Hmm?

278
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:12,540
You orchestrated everything, so I have no
choice but to ask you to walk home with me!

279
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:14,283
Just so you can watch me squirm!

280
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,005
You okay?

281
00:14:16,243 --> 00:14:17,891
Try to sound calm.

282
00:14:17,993 --> 00:14:20,723
Just say something like, "Oh yeah? That's funny."

283
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,882
Oh yeah? Tha-That's funny!

284
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:26,675
Nice!

285
00:14:27,587 --> 00:14:28,110
Uh.

286
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,330
So, anyway.

287
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,530
About your request from this morning.

288
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,773
Hmm?

289
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:33,732
Uh.

290
00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:36,083
I don't have any plans, so uh...

291
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,638
Let's...

292
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:43,152
"Let's" what?

293
00:14:43,453 --> 00:14:45,033
Hang in there, man!

294
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:46,934
If you can get through this,

295
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,182
then you get your chance to mess with Takagi!

296
00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:55,876
Let's walk home together.

297
00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:04,269
I'll have to think about it.

298
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:05,730
Huh?!

299
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:08,486
I'm just kidding.

300
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,534
Let's go.

301
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:13,095
I can't wait.

302
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,366
Because... it looks like you're scheming something.

303
00:15:19,229 --> 00:15:20,366
She's on to me!

304
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:31,256
If she's already suspicious of
me, should I hold off on my plan?

305
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,524
But I came up with such a good idea!

306
00:15:33,863 --> 00:15:37,492
Not that I've thought about how to carry
out said idea to begin with, though.

307
00:15:43,426 --> 00:15:44,806
Want to get some juice?

308
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,487
Now that I think about it, my mouth is dry.

309
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:52,196
Aww.

310
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:53,746
Most of them are sold out.

311
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:57,849
I really wanted to get something cold.

312
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,328
But all they have is...

313
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,109
Sweet red bean soup and whatever that is!

314
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:04,864
What do we do?

315
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:08,856
I need something, but I'm
in a no-win situation here!

316
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:12,326
A "no-win situation"?

317
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,436
Should we find another vending machine?

318
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:17,897
Nah.

319
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,808
I'm thirsty, so I guess...

320
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,850
...I'll just go for this one.

321
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,192
Gross.

322
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,040
With a name like that, duh.

323
00:16:36,146 --> 00:16:37,186
On any other day,

324
00:16:37,211 --> 00:16:39,227
I'd completely regret buying this.

325
00:16:39,763 --> 00:16:42,537
But now I know for sure that my new plan will work!

326
00:16:43,756 --> 00:16:44,960
Hey, Takagi.

327
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:45,920
Hmm?

328
00:16:46,466 --> 00:16:49,845
Say there's one juice that's
really tasty but gives you a fever.

329
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,050
And another that's just plain disgusting.

330
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:54,185
Which would you choose?

331
00:16:55,886 --> 00:16:56,575
Hmm...

332
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:01,458
<b>"Two-Choice Question"</b>

333
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:05,750
One juice that's really tasty but gives you a fever

334
00:17:05,777 --> 00:17:08,465
and another that's just plain disgusting?

335
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,705
Hmm...

336
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:10,925
How's it feel?

337
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,807
You can't decide, can you?

338
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:14,175
Feel the unease!

339
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,205
I want to see your face contorted
with conflicting emotions!

340
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,238
'Kay, question.

341
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:23,751
So if I drank the tasty juice and got a fever.

342
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,160
Would you come and visit me while I'm stuck at home?

343
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:26,763
What?

344
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,000
What's the point in asking me that?

345
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,446
Does it affect your answer?

346
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,921
Significantly.

347
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,542
You wouldn't visit, then?

348
00:17:35,075 --> 00:17:35,542
Uh.

349
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:39,916
Hey. I didn't say that. Don't put words in my mouth.

350
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,209
If you were out sick, then I'd visit you.

351
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,999
Then I'd take the tasty one.

352
00:17:49,613 --> 00:17:51,100
Well, this is weird.

353
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:52,742
What's going on?

354
00:17:53,863 --> 00:17:57,465
I expected her to be conflicted, but
she doesn't have a care in the world.

355
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,792
Hold on.

356
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,788
I feel a little weird now.

357
00:18:00,986 --> 00:18:02,326
Am I the loser here?

358
00:18:03,675 --> 00:18:05,853
Has my "two-choice question" plan failed?

359
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,208
No, it's still too early to give up!

360
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:10,106
'Kay!

361
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,143
Next question!

362
00:18:11,636 --> 00:18:12,367
Okay.

363
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:14,604
No more allowance for your whole life,

364
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,790
or no more teasing me ever?!

365
00:18:16,815 --> 00:18:18,395
No allowance for life.

366
00:18:18,526 --> 00:18:19,414
So quick!

367
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,213
I'd be fine.

368
00:18:21,238 --> 00:18:24,618
I've been saving up my New Year's money
and anything else I've gotten for a while.

369
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,094
And once I'm in high school, I'd just get a job.

370
00:18:27,465 --> 00:18:30,398
Clearly, the better choice is to keep teasing you.

371
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,870
I underestimated her!

372
00:18:33,896 --> 00:18:35,694
I'll need a better question than that.

373
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,743
Nishikata.

374
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:37,469
What?

375
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:40,619
Well, you've asked me two weird questions in a row.

376
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,345
What's your angle?

377
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,183
Are you just trying to give me a hard time?

378
00:18:44,977 --> 00:18:45,526
Huh?

379
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,801
Not really.

380
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:50,634
Fine.

381
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,296
Then I'll ask you one, now.

382
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:54,595
Would you rather that I disappear

383
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,830
or that you'd have to be teased by me forever?

384
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,476
What'll you choose?

385
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,423
Huh?

386
00:18:59,936 --> 00:19:01,420
What do you mean "disappear?"

387
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:03,413
Poof, I'm gone.

388
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,177
I don't want to be teased for the
rest of my life but for her to disappear?

389
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:12,334
That feels like a step too far.

390
00:19:13,573 --> 00:19:16,146
I'd, uh, choose to be teased.

391
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:19,633
Thought so.

392
00:19:19,715 --> 00:19:21,345
You do like being teased.

393
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,404
No, I don't!

394
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:24,002
Why would anyone like that?

395
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:25,297
It's just...

396
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,140
I don't exactly want you to disappear either.

397
00:19:28,265 --> 00:19:29,378
That would suck.

398
00:19:30,526 --> 00:19:31,646
You want to be with me?

399
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:32,335
That it?

400
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:34,610
That's not...

401
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,093
Made you blush!

402
00:19:37,118 --> 00:19:39,418
Man, why does she always have to do this?

403
00:19:39,463 --> 00:19:41,768
Is it that fun to see me uncomfortable?

404
00:19:43,065 --> 00:19:45,725
I gotta come up with a good question to get back at her.

405
00:19:45,805 --> 00:19:46,845
Question two.

406
00:19:46,925 --> 00:19:48,366
Huh? You're not done?

407
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,643
You get zeroes on all tests for the rest of your life,

408
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,773
or you have kiss me.

409
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:54,766
Which is it?

410
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,850
A "kiss"?!

411
00:20:00,953 --> 00:20:02,321
Gotta choose one.

412
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:06,153
I'd get a zero even if I study well?

413
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,660
Yep.

414
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,287
It doesn't matter what you do.

415
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,831
I couldn't live with that!

416
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:15,525
My parents would take away my allowance immediately,
and there's no way I'd get into high school!

417
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,436
But if choose the kiss,

418
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:21,053
she's gonna make fun of me like there's no tomorrow!

419
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:22,969
Hard decision, huh?

420
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,989
Man!

421
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:27,063
The more I struggle to choose, the happier she gets!

422
00:20:27,923 --> 00:20:29,458
I gotta choose quickly.

423
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,642
All zeroes for life is too much!

424
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:32,382
But!

425
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,228
I have no choice!

426
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,660
I'll pick not getting zeroes on my tests.

427
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,697
Sorry, which option was that again?

428
00:20:44,896 --> 00:20:47,571
Th-The one with the kiss.

429
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,156
Ho, ho?

430
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,286
Is that so?

431
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,260
Okay, then.

432
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:10,136
Aww, man.

433
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,294
Looks like you were right.
You are taller than me.

434
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,806
What's with that look?

435
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,914
I was just making sure.

436
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,231
She's messed with me so many times today.

437
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,830
But I have this all figured out now.

438
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,110
One option has to be something she'd never choose,

439
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:47,040
and the other just has to be something
I can make fun of her for picking!

440
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,181
That way, I win no matter what!

441
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,050
Okay, Takagi. I got one...

442
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,156
All right, next question.

443
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,232
You have to go around the school while
doing a handstand, or you and I...

444
00:21:57,257 --> 00:22:00,720
Whoa, hold on a second! I can't even do
a hand stand, that option doesn't work!

445
00:22:00,993 --> 00:22:02,720
And when can I ask the questions again?

446
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,500
As soon as you're done answering my questions.

447
00:22:04,546 --> 00:22:05,939
What? Why?
