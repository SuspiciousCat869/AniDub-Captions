1
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:06,586
All right, buddy,

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,450
I'm sure you know,

3
00:00:08,506 --> 00:00:10,802
but you've been way too loud during class lately.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,780
I expect you to shape up.

5
00:00:13,996 --> 00:00:15,632
Uh. Yes, sir.

6
00:00:16,053 --> 00:00:17,467
Sorry about that.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,080
So I'm putting you in charge of
cleaning the science room after school.

8
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:22,077
Huh?

9
00:00:22,436 --> 00:00:24,750
Don't forget to wipe the desks down, too.

10
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,156
Huh?!

11
00:01:58,404 --> 00:01:59,351
<b>"Cleaning Duty"</b>

12
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:07,120
It's not fair that it's just me.

13
00:02:07,635 --> 00:02:09,635
Takagi should be getting punished, too.

14
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,171
She's the one who's always teasing me during class.

15
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,907
But I guess the problem is that my reactions are too loud.

16
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:20,325
Let's just get this over with and head...

17
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:24,345
What are you doing hiding in the closet?

18
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,211
I was trying to scare you.

19
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:30,546
Ahh...

20
00:02:30,596 --> 00:02:33,076
That was so worth having to waste time in there.

21
00:02:33,323 --> 00:02:36,540
Wait. Lemme guess, you have to clean as punishment, too?

22
00:02:38,153 --> 00:02:39,963
Why don't we just get it over with?

23
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,670
Okay?

24
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,612
So, I have a proposal for you.

25
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:48,832
Before we start,

26
00:02:48,973 --> 00:02:51,523
let's make a game out of cleaning, so it's more fun.

27
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,427
A game?

28
00:02:53,155 --> 00:02:53,735
Yep.

29
00:02:53,816 --> 00:02:58,102
How about we do rock-paper-scissors, and
the loser has to clean a quarter of the room?

30
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:58,942
You in?

31
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:01,242
Hold on.

32
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:04,474
That means if I win all four
times, I won't have to clean anything!

33
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,790
Heh! Sure.

34
00:03:06,883 --> 00:03:08,488
All right, let's get started.

35
00:03:09,613 --> 00:03:10,493
Round one!

36
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,479
I'll use rock.

37
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:14,853
Why's she telling me what she's gonna choose?

38
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,500
Rock. So if I go with paper, I'll win?

39
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,577
But she knows that, so...!

40
00:03:26,562 --> 00:03:28,555
I told you I was going with rock.

41
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,997
I hate you!

42
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,840
You need to trust me more.

43
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,675
I won't be tricked twice.

44
00:03:33,765 --> 00:03:35,515
I'll take her word for it next time.

45
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,051
Oh!

46
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:38,488
And I'm not gonna tell you what I'm picking anymore.

47
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,810
Man.

48
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,862
I knew it.

49
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,115
She's messing with me again.

50
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:48,971
Hmm?

51
00:03:49,343 --> 00:03:50,382
Nishikata!

52
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:51,731
Uh. Hey, Nakai!

53
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,830
What's going' on in here?

54
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:56,556
You two just felt like hanging' out?

55
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,215
No, I was loud in class, so I
have to clean the room as punishment.

56
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,852
Hm. That's rough, man.

57
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,540
What about you?

58
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:07,384
Me? I'm, uh...

59
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,218
...just hanging' around.

60
00:04:10,243 --> 00:04:11,030
You know.

61
00:04:11,446 --> 00:04:12,716
Oh. Okay.

62
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,660
Hey, Nakai.

63
00:04:15,703 --> 00:04:17,403
Let's not get in their way, yeah?

64
00:04:17,499 --> 00:04:18,652
Oh. You're right.

65
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,437
Well, we'll be on our way.

66
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:23,088
Cool. See yah around.

67
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:25,505
Oh, and Nishikata.

68
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,018
Huh?

69
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,173
Good luck to yah, dude!

70
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,800
Uh. Oh, right.

71
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:31,997
With this?

72
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:35,094
Come on, let's just get out of here.

73
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:36,829
Sorry, Takagi!

74
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,020
Mm-hm.

75
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,160
See yah!

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,040
By the way, bet you didn't know.

77
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,255
They're going out.

78
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,889
Wait, what? They are?

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,592
Seriously? I had no idea.

80
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:51,971
I mean, I did notice them hanging
out a lot lately, but still...

81
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,080
It's not like they're trying to hide it.

82
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,065
It's just that they're both the kind
of people who wouldn't announce it.

83
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,019
True.

84
00:04:58,803 --> 00:05:01,677
He said he's hanging around, and she was with him.

85
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:05,914
But if you notice, they were on their way to the rooftop.

86
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:08,337
The... The rooftop?

87
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,221
And right about now,

88
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,920
they're probably all alone up there.

89
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:15,582
Huh? Just the two of them?

90
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:20,594
You gonna clean?

91
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,580
Huh? Uh. Yeah!

92
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:23,316
I am.

93
00:05:29,073 --> 00:05:31,775
Aww. Enjoying their time.

94
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:34,236
With each other.

95
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:36,020
Up there together.

96
00:05:36,647 --> 00:05:37,580
I wonder what...

97
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:39,055
I wonder what it's like.

98
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:42,920
Up there.

99
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,471
Right?

100
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,194
Yeah. I guess so.

101
00:06:05,013 --> 00:06:06,593
Hey. I finished.

102
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:08,350
Okay, then.

103
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,949
Rock, paper, scissors.

104
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,670
How did I end up losing every time?

105
00:06:21,176 --> 00:06:22,876
Well, that's finally done!

106
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,580
Let's go. It's getting late.

107
00:06:25,913 --> 00:06:27,020
So casual.

108
00:06:27,045 --> 00:06:29,844
I hope you learned your lesson
and won't tease me in class now.

109
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,930
I guess.

110
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:32,667
I could always just be more discreet.

111
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:34,787
We're gonna get in trouble no matter what!

112
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:37,172
Yeah, well, if it happens, it happens.

113
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,345
Not to mention.

114
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,870
I wasn't even told to clean in the first place.

115
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,808
Huh? You've gotta be kidding!

116
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,700
Okay, for real.

117
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:48,959
Why am I the only one who gets in trouble all the time?

118
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,593
So you're just here to mess with me, like usual?

119
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,403
There's that, but...

120
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,697
...I wanted to enjoy my time, too.

121
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:03,681
Huh? Enjoy...

122
00:07:04,845 --> 00:07:06,985
...your time?

123
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:12,621
And on that note, you're buying me juice on our way home.

124
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,398
What? Why?

125
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:18,312
<b>"Kickover"</b>

126
00:07:20,897 --> 00:07:22,344
The sun's killing me.

127
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,887
Yeah, me too.

128
00:07:23,912 --> 00:07:25,260
I'm really thirsty.

129
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:28,876
Oh! I know.

130
00:07:29,046 --> 00:07:31,592
How about a competition and the loser buys drinks.

131
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,520
Yeah, why not?

132
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:38,017
Can I decide what we compete in then?

133
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:39,643
Think I've got a good idea.

134
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:41,927
The high bar?

135
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:46,721
Uh-huh. Whichever one of us can't do a
kickover on the high bar is the loser.

136
00:07:48,716 --> 00:07:51,933
I just happened to try doing a
kickover on the high bar recently.

137
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,365
And bam! I was actually able
to for the first time in my life!

138
00:07:56,652 --> 00:08:00,613
Ever since then, I've been itching'
for my chance to show Takagi up in a duel!

139
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,252
To be honest, I wouldn't be all that
surprised if she could do one, too.

140
00:08:05,837 --> 00:08:06,735
But!

141
00:08:06,906 --> 00:08:08,355
Hey, Nishikata.

142
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:11,496
You realize, I'm wearing a skirt, right?

143
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,607
Exactly!

144
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,102
Can't flip over the bar wearing a skirt!

145
00:08:16,493 --> 00:08:18,005
She's unable to compete!

146
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,099
I win!

147
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:20,829
Oh, well.

148
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:23,219
I call dibs on going first, then.

149
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:24,026
Eh?

150
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,843
Really? You want to?

151
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,354
Yeah, it's fine.

152
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,330
However, I'd like to add one extra rule.

153
00:08:31,355 --> 00:08:32,552
You can't watch me.

154
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,226
Huh?

155
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,781
You're surprised?

156
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,465
I am wearing a skirt.

157
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:40,855
So if you look at me on my turn, then you're the loser.

158
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,120
Here I go!

159
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,412
Okay.

160
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,616
Your turn, show me what you got.

161
00:08:59,846 --> 00:09:01,306
Did she really do it?

162
00:09:01,512 --> 00:09:02,972
I have no way of knowing.

163
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:05,443
Whatever, now's not the time.

164
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,577
I've gotta focus on the task at hand!

165
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:14,780
Whoa.

166
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,533
Well, we both were able to do it.

167
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,707
So what now?

168
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,660
One more time. Do over.

169
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:23,137
All right.

170
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,763
Then I'll go first again, 'Kay?

171
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,139
No hesitation.

172
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,750
That's not a good sign.

173
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,510
She's either really confident or hiding something.

174
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,593
I bet she's not even doing a kickover.

175
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,450
She said I lose if I look during her turn.

176
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:42,000
But it's a different story if she's cheating.

177
00:09:42,025 --> 00:09:44,554
Today's the day that I finally beat her!

178
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:53,995
No way!

179
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,990
She's actually doing it?

180
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,003
Shorts?!

181
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm done.

182
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:11,315
You can turn around now.

183
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:15,555
What's wrong?

184
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,650
Sorry, Takagi.

185
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,488
I lose.

186
00:10:25,513 --> 00:10:26,183
Here.

187
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,152
Thanks.

188
00:10:28,322 --> 00:10:30,492
Though, I don't really feel like a winner.

189
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,886
Since you disqualified yourself and all.

190
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,080
Yeah, about that.

191
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,797
If you had shorts on the whole time,
then why didn't you let me watch you do it?

192
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,094
Pervert.

193
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,885
Hey, don't get the wrong idea!

194
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,079
I just wanted to make sure you
were actually swinging over the bar!

195
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,200
Really?

196
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,597
Yes, really!

197
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,413
All right, then.

198
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:07,095
So you thought I was cheating, is that it?

199
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,252
What?! No, I just... Ugh...

200
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,830
All right, what's the big idea?

201
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:34,089
Why are you always picking on me, day in and day out?

202
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,572
It's nothing.

203
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,520
Huh? Ba-dump!

204
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,510
Be straight. You like being treated this way, don't you?

205
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,141
Ahh... Squeal!

206
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,648
I said,

207
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,135
"You like being treated this way, don't you?"

208
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,309
Ahh... Squeal!

209
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,343
<i>100% Unrequited Love</i> is so good!

210
00:12:10,214 --> 00:12:11,369
<b>"Cold"</b>

211
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,161
Pay attention, this part's important.

212
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:18,765
And you can bet it's gonna be on the test.

213
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,567
So make sure you remember it.

214
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:37,255
Morning. Sorry I'm late.

215
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,612
Hey, Nishikata.

216
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,065
I wasn't expecting you. I thought you were out sick.

217
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,272
Are you feeling better?

218
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:49,094
Yeah. I think so.

219
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:52,139
Morning. You have a cold?

220
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,780
Yeah.

221
00:12:55,545 --> 00:12:56,649
But it's nothing.

222
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,462
I can handle it.

223
00:12:58,723 --> 00:12:59,882
No big deal.

224
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:01,157
Nailed it!

225
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,014
Huh?

226
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,117
I bet you just stayed up watching <i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

227
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:11,605
How did she figure that out?

228
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:13,673
Squeal, squeal!

229
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:16,261
Don't say that so loud, it's embarrassing!

230
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:19,224
Funny, I only heard you screaming.

231
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,311
You're right. Sorry, sir!

232
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:25,035
Come on, that was really low, Takagi.

233
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,089
You okay?

234
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,149
You're coughing.

235
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:31,009
Yeah. It's not that bad.

236
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,176
Man.

237
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:36,640
She won't pull any punches even when I'm sick!

238
00:13:38,053 --> 00:13:38,493
Heh...

239
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:42,413
But luckily, I have the ultimate plan to defeat her today!

240
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:45,992
Wait, what's a guy like him doing here?

241
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,829
Him and his perfect hair!

242
00:13:47,854 --> 00:13:48,910
Now I'm really mad!

243
00:13:48,935 --> 00:13:50,722
I'm going to give him a piece of my mind!

244
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:52,002
Hey!

245
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,540
Oh wow.

246
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,674
You're so cute.

247
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:07,837
Squeal!

248
00:14:10,743 --> 00:14:12,065
I can do that!

249
00:14:15,546 --> 00:14:20,180
I may have caught a cold, but it was worth
it for the invaluable knowledge I've gained!

250
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,201
Okay, Takagi. Come at me.

251
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:28,949
Gimme your best shot! I'll counter it and make you blush!

252
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:32,599
Ni...

253
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,757
Come on!

254
00:14:46,793 --> 00:14:48,037
Whenever you're ready!

255
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,227
Uh...

256
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:54,808
Uh. What?

257
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,732
Don't worry. 'S nothing.

258
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,042
Weird.

259
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:08,955
She isn't making her move.

260
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:11,357
I can't stay in this pose forever.

261
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:14,373
And my right hand's on my
chin, so I can't even take notes.

262
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:18,443
Wait, what if she figured it out because of the pose?

263
00:15:18,468 --> 00:15:21,090
Is it too obvious I've got a
counter-trap ready to spring on her?

264
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,972
One way to find out.

265
00:15:25,393 --> 00:15:27,067
Sit normally.

266
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:41,580
What's her deal today?

267
00:15:41,605 --> 00:15:42,867
I don't understand!

268
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:45,857
Any other day, she'd have teased me three times by now!

269
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,679
Is she sick or something?

270
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:49,885
Huh?

271
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,245
When she's quiet, she's really...

272
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,517
Uh-oh.

273
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,885
I think I'm starting to second guess my plan here.

274
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,224
Countering with "You're cute," when
she messes with me might be embarrassing.

275
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:26,540
Duh, of course it is!

276
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,754
How did I ever think I'd be able to say that?

277
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:32,200
I bet it's because I'm sick, and
didn't get any sleep last night.

278
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,242
Are you okay?

279
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:33,727
Hey.

280
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,040
Uh. Yeah.

281
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,062
It's all good.

282
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,959
Your face is a little red.

283
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,652
Huh?

284
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,925
And you look tired.

285
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:41,931
Sure you're good?

286
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,498
Yes, I'm fine.

287
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:46,493
But you're getting even redder.

288
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,705
Do you have a fever?

289
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,776
Why are you being so nice to me today, Takagi?

290
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:53,810
How many times do I have to tell you? I'm totally okay!

291
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,870
Really?

292
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,644
Really!

293
00:16:55,953 --> 00:16:59,511
When I said I was feeling sick,
it was more like an excuse, anyway.

294
00:16:59,717 --> 00:17:02,877
I really just woke up at like,
eight-thirty, so that's why I was late.

295
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,378
I'm fine! Promise!

296
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:05,418
Okay.

297
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:06,820
I guess I believe you.

298
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,422
It's about time!

299
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,127
So... I can tease you again.

300
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,827
Huh? What do you mean?

301
00:17:16,153 --> 00:17:20,127
And of course, she ended up making
fun of me more than usual that day.

302
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:22,589
Young love!

303
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:23,986
Squeal!

304
00:17:24,101 --> 00:17:26,835
Yukari, Sanae, what's with the snail's pace?

305
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,008
Power walk, let's go!

306
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:30,715
Why should I exert myself that much for a Popsicle?

307
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,925
'Cus, it's the baked sweet potato flavor!

308
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,580
It's a summer exclusive!

309
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,515
That's a weird flavor for summer.

310
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,595
They're sold out of it everywhere that I've looked.

311
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,785
But I think this one snack store will have it.

312
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,249
So we gotta check before they sell out too!

313
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:47,135
What are you doing?

314
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,891
There's no point in taking a shortcut if
you're gonna drag your feet the whole time!

315
00:17:51,763 --> 00:17:55,254
I just noticed Takagi and Nishikata are inside the store.

316
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,729
Oh hey. You're right.

317
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,186
Could it be that those two are...?

318
00:18:01,263 --> 00:18:03,470
Mina, maybe we shouldn't get in their way...

319
00:18:03,495 --> 00:18:06,455
Hey! Takagi!

320
00:18:10,952 --> 00:18:12,155
<b>"Tailing"</b>

321
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,979
Sha-bam!

322
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:16,610
Got my sweet potato pop!

323
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,945
Uh. I'm happy for you.

324
00:18:23,242 --> 00:18:24,618
See you tomorrow.

325
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:27,716
They're so lucky.

326
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,370
Lucky how?

327
00:18:29,423 --> 00:18:31,052
Well, look at the two of them.

328
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,866
You know.

329
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,700
A guy and a girl together.

330
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,894
It's just nice.

331
00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:38,675
Huh? Why?

332
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:41,005
You didn't notice?

333
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:44,260
Don't blame me, it was your idea.

334
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,635
Hey. Why exactly are we following them?

335
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,472
We live in the opposite direction.

336
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,659
Shhh!

337
00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:57,656
They're gonna notice us. Shut up!

338
00:18:57,933 --> 00:18:59,422
Just tell me what you think.

339
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,589
Don't you feel,

340
00:19:00,614 --> 00:19:03,095
I dunno, like something's going on between them?

341
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,895
Hmm...

342
00:19:04,368 --> 00:19:06,564
Oh! They've got a bike right there!

343
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:08,617
They should be riding it together, right?

344
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,404
That is so romantic!

345
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,831
Riding home together after school.

346
00:19:12,856 --> 00:19:14,710
Oh, but that's a tough decision, because you can

347
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,749
spend a lot more time together if you walk instead!

348
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,485
Maybe if you trade off every other day?

349
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,000
Can I have a bite of that?

350
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,708
Uh. Yeah, but just one bite, okay?

351
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,725
Hey, Takagi.

352
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,338
You wanna race somewhere?

353
00:19:28,595 --> 00:19:30,055
Are you challenging me?

354
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,633
Uh-huh!

355
00:19:31,026 --> 00:19:32,665
We'll start once we turn that corner.

356
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:35,167
The first one to make it all the way to the shrine wins.

357
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:37,378
Hmm. Okay, why not?

358
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:41,000
Haha. She either has to ride her bike or pull it.

359
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,200
With that flat tire, she'll lose either way.

360
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:45,604
You have way too wild an imagination!

361
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:47,992
I guarantee you they're not talking about a race!

362
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,240
They're talking about something more intimate than that.

363
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,425
I just know it!

364
00:19:58,479 --> 00:19:59,531
Nishikata.

365
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,964
I'm up for us racing to the shrine.

366
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:04,010
But before that...

367
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:04,690
Hmm?

368
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:14,762
They're gone?

369
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,458
Did they make it all the way to the shrine already?

370
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:18,527
No way!

371
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,425
Maybe they realized we were tailing them.

372
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,661
Ugh, come on, let's go home already.

373
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,636
Uh. Yeah.

374
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:33,579
I say we buy more popsicles on the way.

375
00:20:33,613 --> 00:20:35,132
Will you let me have a bite?

376
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,948
Just buy your own if you're gonna keep eating mine!

377
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,473
So close.

378
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,004
Hmm?

379
00:20:53,466 --> 00:20:56,005
Ah. Did we lose them?

380
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:02,243
Any idea why they were following us in the first place?

381
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:03,642
No.

382
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,171
Hey, uh...

383
00:21:05,446 --> 00:21:08,546
Now that I think about it, we should
have gone around that corner too.

384
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,912
It would have been a lot easier to hide over there.

385
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,574
Huh.

386
00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:13,775
I hadn't thought about that, guess you're right.

387
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:15,804
But I wonder...

388
00:21:17,082 --> 00:21:18,867
Would you have preferred if we did?

389
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,030
Well, no.

390
00:21:22,473 --> 00:21:23,766
It doesn't really matter.

391
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,693
Good!

392
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,795
I'm glad.

393
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,658
Oh, I almost forgot!

394
00:21:27,783 --> 00:21:29,412
We're racing to the shrine, yeah?

395
00:21:29,935 --> 00:21:32,190
Ready, set go!

396
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:35,234
Huh?! Hey, hold on!

397
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:38,381
I'm calling' you out! That's a false start, Takagi!

398
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:14,603
Tailing those two turned out to be kinda fun in the end.

399
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,160
Taking' the long way home.

400
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,950
They probably did notice us following them.

401
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,480
I better apologize to Takagi tomorrow.

402
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:27,367
They're out of the baked sweet potato flavor!

403
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:29,555
It's okay!

404
00:23:29,694 --> 00:23:31,260
They got red bean soup!

405
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:34,353
What is with you wanting these flavors in the summer?

406
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:36,376
So you gonna let me have a bite?
