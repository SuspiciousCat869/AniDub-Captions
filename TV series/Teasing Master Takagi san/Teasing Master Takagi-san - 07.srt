1
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:38,153
A brand new issue.

2
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:42,499
Day-one purchase.

3
00:00:44,894 --> 00:00:45,800
<b>"Shopping"</b>

4
00:00:47,626 --> 00:00:48,360
Here you go.

5
00:00:49,197 --> 00:00:50,087
Thanks, Mom.

6
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:56,373
I have a few stores I want to browse,
so let's meet back here when you're done.

7
00:00:56,653 --> 00:00:57,391
Gotcha.

8
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:00,845
And don't get anything too showy, okay?

9
00:01:02,726 --> 00:01:03,745
I won't.

10
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,634
Thank you, come again.

11
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:10,282
Volume five of <i>100% Unrequited Love</i>!

12
00:02:45,243 --> 00:02:47,738
I wonder what type I should try on first.

13
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:52,863
Hmm...

14
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,833
Actually, what type does he like?

15
00:02:59,623 --> 00:03:00,408
Hmm...

16
00:03:05,122 --> 00:03:08,662
I can't wait to get home and read this cover to cover!

17
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,080
Nishikata!

18
00:03:13,723 --> 00:03:15,312
What are you doing here?

19
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,582
Uh, shopping?

20
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:17,620
Same as you.

21
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,682
Again?

22
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:21,843
Why does she always have to
show up at the worst possible time?

23
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:24,542
I swear, she's gotta be following me or something!

24
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,544
No.

25
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:27,834
Now's not the time to think about that.

26
00:03:28,143 --> 00:03:32,193
I need to focus my energy into making
sure she doesn't find out what I bought.

27
00:03:33,486 --> 00:03:36,276
Anyway, I saw you leaving the bookstore.

28
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:37,305
Here it comes!

29
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,423
Gotta think quick!

30
00:03:39,242 --> 00:03:39,955
Did you buy something...?

31
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,719
So you're shopping? That's cool! Whatcha getting?

32
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,740
That was too close a call.

33
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,056
I hope changing the subject is
enough to get out of this alive.

34
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,644
Mainly, a bathing suit.

35
00:04:00,082 --> 00:04:01,212
A bathing suit?

36
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,480
Are you blushing?

37
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:07,257
No, it's just hot in here!

38
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:08,778
Hey.

39
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,540
What kind of girl's bathing suit do you think looks best?

40
00:04:12,674 --> 00:04:15,094
Uh, what kind of...? Why you asking me?

41
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,440
I-I don't know, they're all probably fine.

42
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,848
You've seen 'em all?

43
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,345
You're quite the connoisseur.

44
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,595
No, you don't get it!

45
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,110
I mean that I couldn't care less! I'm not some expert!

46
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:26,823
Hot in here?

47
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,498
Yes, it's hot in here.

48
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,200
Typical. Of course, she messes with
me the second we bump into each other.

49
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,287
All right, I'm gonna go home now.

50
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:37,907
'Kay.

51
00:04:38,797 --> 00:04:41,728
At least, I was able to hide the manga from her.

52
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,385
You just bought the new volume of <i>Unrequited Love,</i> right?

53
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,398
Could I borrow it?

54
00:04:46,863 --> 00:04:48,384
I was so close!

55
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:49,755
Was she watching me?

56
00:04:52,622 --> 00:04:54,962
I don't know what you're talking about.

57
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:57,166
You don't? Was I wrong?

58
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,385
Hey, wait.

59
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:03,788
There's no way she could have seen from
outside with the register where it is.

60
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,321
She's bluffing.

61
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:11,022
Dodged a bullet there.

62
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:13,259
Yeah, totally wrong.

63
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,659
You couldn't be more off.

64
00:05:14,803 --> 00:05:15,683
Oh yeah?

65
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:17,260
Then what did you buy?

66
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:20,566
Uh, <i>Robot Zombie</i>?

67
00:05:29,641 --> 00:05:31,795
Yeah, sure, whatever, that!

68
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,653
It's like, the last thing a girl would be interested in!

69
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,365
It's way too ridiculous!

70
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:39,561
Yeah, right.

71
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,570
You bought <i>Unrequited Love,</i> didn't you?

72
00:05:41,595 --> 00:05:43,090
Yup! Sure did!

73
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,487
Gah!

74
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:47,144
N-No.

75
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:48,865
Let me see it, then.

76
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:53,279
Man. She backed me into a corner again.

77
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:56,423
This is what always happens.

78
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,082
No matter what I do, I can
never beat Takagi at her own game.

79
00:06:02,986 --> 00:06:05,576
Wait, I take that back.

80
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:10,437
Okay, but first, shall we make a bet?

81
00:06:10,796 --> 00:06:11,343
Hmm?

82
00:06:12,803 --> 00:06:16,888
We can bet on whether or not the
book I bought is <i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

83
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:21,055
I say our usual condition applies.

84
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,903
If you're wrong, you have to do whatever I tell you to.

85
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,470
Fine with me.

86
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,567
And if I get it right, then you do whatever I want.

87
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,802
Yeah, okay.

88
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,330
So, then what is it you think I purchased?

89
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:34,976
Heh.

90
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,366
It's all in the presentation.

91
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,226
It's your move, Takagi.

92
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,667
I'm sure my level of confidence
will have you second guessing yourself.

93
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,347
Huh?

94
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:47,701
Nishikata sounds so much more confident than normal.

95
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:51,465
Maybe it's actually not <i>100% Unrequited Love</i>!

96
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:58,957
Oh yeah. If she's gonna find out anyway, I
might as well teach her a lesson in the process.

97
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,357
Think you can just get me like that again?

98
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,352
Nuh-uh. I've learned.

99
00:07:03,386 --> 00:07:04,125
Know what?

100
00:07:04,386 --> 00:07:06,346
I'm gonna bet that it's <i>Unrequited Love.</i>

101
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:07,418
Huh?

102
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,161
Y-You sure about that?

103
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,101
Mm-hmm.

104
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:14,724
Let's see it.

105
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:22,595
Awesome!

106
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,740
I got it right!

107
00:07:26,387 --> 00:07:28,933
I don't know how she saw through me that time.

108
00:07:29,096 --> 00:07:31,135
I should just go home and read this.

109
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,735
That'll make me feel better.

110
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:35,503
Ugh. I'll see yah around.

111
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:37,256
Where do you think you're going?

112
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,890
Help me out.

113
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,287
I need a bathing suit.

114
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:48,594
We said if I won.

115
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,858
I'd get to tell you what to do, didn't we?

116
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:53,702
I have to help her pick one?

117
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,162
Hot in here?

118
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,639
Yes, it's still hot!

119
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:00,626
<b>"Bathing Suit"</b>

120
00:08:07,293 --> 00:08:09,352
Which one do you like most?

121
00:08:11,543 --> 00:08:14,433
Uh. They all look nice to me.

122
00:08:14,783 --> 00:08:16,783
Will you actually look and pick one?

123
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:18,518
You did lose our bet.

124
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,870
I don't think she realizes what she's asking of me.

125
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,880
It's embarrassing just being here! I
can't look directly at the bathing suits!

126
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,265
Oh. Check it out.

127
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:32,957
What do you think of this one?

128
00:08:34,663 --> 00:08:38,226
I guess I just have to pick one
if I want to get this over with.

129
00:08:38,526 --> 00:08:41,283
I-I think that one's nice.

130
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:42,310
Oh?

131
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:47,024
In that case, I might as well try it on.

132
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:48,004
Huh?

133
00:08:48,948 --> 00:08:51,972
Stay right there. I'll only be a minute.

134
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:54,567
What am I doing?

135
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,141
How did I end up in this situation?

136
00:08:58,326 --> 00:09:01,004
Right now, just beyond that curtain.

137
00:09:01,562 --> 00:09:04,884
Takagi is taking off her...

138
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:12,547
How's it look?

139
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:16,557
I dunno, fine?

140
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:17,703
That's all?

141
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,660
I'll try on another, then.

142
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:21,991
You mean you're not done?

143
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,217
Until you tell me I look good in one.

144
00:09:25,242 --> 00:09:26,257
No, I'm not.

145
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:30,469
Huh? Tell her she looks good?

146
00:09:30,494 --> 00:09:32,850
That's way too embarrassing for me to say!

147
00:09:35,906 --> 00:09:37,316
Hey, Nishikata.

148
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:41,838
Sorry, can you hand me that bathing suit?

149
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,658
Huh?!

150
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,217
The yellow one I was looking at.

151
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:50,848
She's covering herself, does that mean?

152
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,486
It's to the left of that one.

153
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,354
Uh-huh, that's it.

154
00:09:54,513 --> 00:09:56,383
Just a few feet to my right.

155
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,304
She's totally naked.

156
00:10:12,364 --> 00:10:13,742
Sorry again.

157
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,139
Thanks a bunch.

158
00:10:27,172 --> 00:10:29,172
Oh, gimme a break!

159
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,499
That was totally on purpose!

160
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:36,029
But forget that, I need to get out
of this store as soon as possible.

161
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,660
If someone from school sees me here with Takagi,

162
00:10:38,743 --> 00:10:40,054
I'll never hear the end of it.

163
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,950
Wow, there are so many!

164
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,759
All right! How's this one?

165
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:52,979
Uh.

166
00:10:55,026 --> 00:10:56,940
Oh. Hi, Takagi!

167
00:10:57,586 --> 00:10:58,789
Hey, Mano!

168
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:02,512
Hey, Nakai.

169
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:05,252
Uh, hey, what's going' on?

170
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:08,032
You're here to get a bathing suit?

171
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,450
Yeah, I assume that's why you're here, too?

172
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,612
Ow...

173
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:16,020
Hey, Mano, it's embarrassing being
here. Can we hurry it up already?

174
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:19,542
Wha?! We've barely been here five minutes!

175
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,700
If I rush, I might miss something I'd really like!

176
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:23,993
Hmm?

177
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,988
How 'bout we come back later?

178
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,805
What? But you said...

179
00:11:42,877 --> 00:11:44,072
It doesn't matter.

180
00:11:44,283 --> 00:11:45,923
See you later, Takagi!

181
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,992
'Kay!

182
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,810
Don't worry, the coast is clear.

183
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,810
They're gone.

184
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:04,118
Oh. Is that so?

185
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,120
You get so shy sometimes.

186
00:12:07,145 --> 00:12:07,925
What do you mean?

187
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:08,935
No I don't.

188
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:10,709
Well then.

189
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:13,369
Back to trying on more, I assume.

190
00:12:14,856 --> 00:12:17,521
We should probably hurry up and pick one of these out.

191
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:21,713
Otherwise, you'll die of embarrassment.

192
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:23,743
Oh, shut up. I'm fine.

193
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,702
So...

194
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:29,722
...which of these do you like better?

195
00:12:29,796 --> 00:12:32,756
Uh. I dunno, whichever you like, I guess?

196
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,633
Then how about this one here?

197
00:12:35,696 --> 00:12:36,901
Think this one's good?

198
00:12:39,823 --> 00:12:40,723
Uh-huh.

199
00:12:41,236 --> 00:12:44,543
I keep coming back to this pink
one. Do you think it's good too?

200
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,563
Uh-huh.

201
00:12:45,893 --> 00:12:47,365
And this one-piece?

202
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:48,865
Mm-hm.

203
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:51,106
Wanna go swimming together sometime?

204
00:12:51,492 --> 00:12:52,357
Uh-huh.

205
00:12:55,546 --> 00:12:56,572
It's a date.

206
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,908
Okay.

207
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,065
I'll buy you something to drink later.

208
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,425
You're burning up again.

209
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,515
Yeah, I mean, it is super-hot in here!

210
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,776
They should really fix the air conditioning!

211
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,365
The ocean!

212
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,243
We swimming' or what?

213
00:13:19,236 --> 00:13:21,238
Of course we are, come on!

214
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:28,074
Water.

215
00:13:34,051 --> 00:13:35,460
<b>"Ocean"</b>

216
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:38,122
We got the waves!

217
00:13:38,469 --> 00:13:40,363
We got the sun!

218
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,356
We got the seaweed.

219
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,853
Stop Sanae. It's all gross and slimy!

220
00:13:48,322 --> 00:13:49,872
What are you doing, Yukari?

221
00:13:53,557 --> 00:13:55,305
What does it look like I'm doing?

222
00:13:55,423 --> 00:13:57,238
I'm pumping air into this.

223
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,549
But we're at the beach.

224
00:13:58,574 --> 00:14:00,577
You should at least go for a swim, first.

225
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,620
I wouldn't be doing this if I
could just jump in the water.

226
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:09,043
Ah! What, you can't swim?

227
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:13,606
You do sit out during swim lessons.

228
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:15,425
Though you'd probably learn if you didn't.

229
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,341
Whatever.

230
00:14:16,366 --> 00:14:18,565
Just go have fun, I'll be there soon.

231
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,340
Shoo. Shoo.

232
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:37,925
Ah! That was fun, but I'm wiped!

233
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,703
Yeah, let's take a break for now.

234
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,045
Huh?

235
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,440
What happened?

236
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:46,777
You okay, Yukari?

237
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,700
Yeah, I'm okay.

238
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,109
But I managed to break the pump somehow.

239
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,603
So I was blowing it up on my own, and I got winded.

240
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,161
Man, Yukari, do you ever have fun, or do you just suffer?

241
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,209
You don't know my life!

242
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,257
And just for that, I'm not gonna
help you with your homework anymore!

243
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:10,066
Hope you can do it on your own!

244
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,120
You what?

245
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,160
But I can't!

246
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,515
Please have mercy! I won't make fun of you anymore!

247
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,291
Crying won't get you anywhere.

248
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:28,848
Nishikata, are you making
progress on your summer homework?

249
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,675
Uh...

250
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,755
Yeah.

251
00:15:31,468 --> 00:15:33,378
I guess you could say that.

252
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:35,302
Oh?

253
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:39,101
Hey, wanna do our homework together?

254
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:42,753
Uh. Yeah, sure, that's cool.

255
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:44,228
But I have plans in the afternoon.

256
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:45,137
That's fine.

257
00:15:45,162 --> 00:15:47,165
Let's just work on it until noon.

258
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,909
You can copy my answers.

259
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:52,810
Huh?

260
00:15:53,473 --> 00:15:55,110
Okay, then where should we do it?

261
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,310
At the library?

262
00:15:56,335 --> 00:15:59,613
Or, wait. We wouldn't have very
much time to get our stuff, then.

263
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,443
You're over-thinking this.

264
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,180
We could just go over to your house.

265
00:16:12,646 --> 00:16:13,560
<b>"Room"</b>

266
00:16:17,973 --> 00:16:19,400
What is my life?

267
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:21,960
Out of nowhere, Takagi,

268
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:24,883
a girl is coming to my room!

269
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,113
Are we going in?

270
00:16:27,776 --> 00:16:29,736
Sorry. Spaced out for a sec.

271
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,160
This place is nice.

272
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:37,055
You don't have to be polite.

273
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,365
My parents aren't here anyway.

274
00:16:44,612 --> 00:16:46,112
This feels like a dream.

275
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,340
Is this a dream?

276
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,450
Takagi is actually in my room.

277
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,663
It feels so surreal.

278
00:16:54,186 --> 00:16:55,245
What's wrong?

279
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,450
You spaced out again.

280
00:16:59,167 --> 00:16:59,815
Oh.

281
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,876
It's nothing!

282
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:05,613
Hey!

283
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,620
It's your favorite girl's manga!

284
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,651
Aww, you found me! Squeal!

285
00:17:11,926 --> 00:17:13,796
You have every volume!

286
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,500
Huh?!

287
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,680
Don't touch that!

288
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,690
S-Sorry.

289
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,390
Why are you apologizing?

290
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,688
Well, you know, because we were just so...

291
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:27,343
You like this, right?

292
00:17:30,586 --> 00:17:33,016
If you like something, you should just admit it.

293
00:17:33,163 --> 00:17:34,587
What does she mean?

294
00:17:34,823 --> 00:17:36,595
"This" as in her being in my room?

295
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,685
How am I supposed to respond to that?

296
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,615
Maybe this is a dream after all!

297
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:44,748
<i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

298
00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:47,683
You do like it, right?

299
00:17:47,856 --> 00:17:49,515
There's really no need to hide it.

300
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,711
That's what she was talking about?

301
00:17:55,396 --> 00:17:59,333
Now that I've had a chance to look
around, this room just screams "you."

302
00:17:59,553 --> 00:18:01,599
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

303
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:05,387
Hmm...

304
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,477
No, not exactly.

305
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,646
But either way, I like it.

306
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,020
W-Want to start our homework?

307
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,620
Read my mind!

308
00:18:23,527 --> 00:18:24,237
Oh right.

309
00:18:24,276 --> 00:18:26,196
But I only have one desk.

310
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,864
Do you have a folding table or something?

311
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:32,225
Yeah, but they're all being used in different rooms.

312
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:34,040
Too bad.

313
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,340
Then should we sit in the same chair?

314
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,303
Uh...

315
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,188
Huh?!

316
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:44,046
I'm just messing around.

317
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,575
Oh, I know.

318
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,796
We could use your bed.

319
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:59,888
Uh. Um.

320
00:19:00,952 --> 00:19:02,122
Move this.

321
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:04,889
And we've basically got one big desk right here!

322
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,439
You okay?

323
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,490
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

324
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,675
Good idea.

325
00:19:12,493 --> 00:19:13,493
Ohh?

326
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,680
What's the problem?

327
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,337
Lay off.

328
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,770
No problem.

329
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:17,729
Come on.

330
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,762
Let's start.

331
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:21,872
Wait, I'm sitting there, too?

332
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,048
So, hey, uh...

333
00:19:29,073 --> 00:19:31,175
Remember what you said about your answers?

334
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,787
Of course, they are right here.

335
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,958
Awesome, thanks a ton!

336
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,635
Though, I only grabbed these.

337
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,068
Kanji writing drills.

338
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,305
That's so not fair; You tricked me!

339
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,473
No, I didn't.

340
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,950
That's enough.

341
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:53,860
Let's work.

342
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,330
Wait.

343
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,540
If we're just practicing kanji,

344
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,400
was there ever any reason to do our homework together?

345
00:20:24,893 --> 00:20:29,146
Oh no! I saw this exact thing on <i>100% Unrequited Love</i>!

346
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,320
Jeez. I don't know why I have to
make curry with this jerk of all people!

347
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:37,050
He makes me so mad!

348
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:45,679
Um. You can let go of my hand now.

349
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:48,232
Why would I want to do something like that?

350
00:20:48,763 --> 00:20:49,593
C'mere.

351
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,015
Let me see that face.

352
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,590
I can't do that!

353
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,515
You can use it.

354
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,361
It is your eraser, after all.

355
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,396
That's my bad.

356
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,105
Uh. Okay.

357
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,088
Your hand.

358
00:21:09,045 --> 00:21:09,719
Sorry!

359
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,860
You want something' to drink?

360
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,870
Like tea? You want tea?

361
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,610
Mm-hmm.

362
00:21:16,302 --> 00:21:17,612
Coming' right up!

363
00:21:41,846 --> 00:21:43,256
Thanks for having me.

364
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,480
All she did was mess with me.

365
00:21:45,907 --> 00:21:46,857
I think.

366
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,776
Bye!

367
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,120
I'll come again.

368
00:21:54,802 --> 00:21:55,707
Huh?

369
00:21:55,855 --> 00:21:57,454
She'll come again?

370
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,958
Maybe... I should clean my room.
