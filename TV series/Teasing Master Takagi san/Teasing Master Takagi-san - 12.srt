1
00:00:32,817 --> 00:00:34,587
Sanae!

2
00:00:35,303 --> 00:00:36,856
Here! For you.

3
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,086
Uh... A love letter?

4
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:43,467
Of course not! It's just a regular letter!

5
00:00:43,513 --> 00:00:46,507
Everyone's writing them to their
friends these days! Haven't you noticed?

6
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:47,667
No.

7
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,784
Don't you worry, Yukari, I'm gonna write one for you too.

8
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,345
That's nice of you, just don't do it in class.

9
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,845
You need to focus on the lesson.

10
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,470
Friendship is way more important than any lesson.

11
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,900
What, are the girls all suddenly into writing letters now?

12
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:03,280
That's what it looks like.

13
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:06,095
I wonder if some of them are writing love letters, too.

14
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:09,718
Maybe. They do seem really into it.

15
00:01:09,743 --> 00:01:10,863
I'll say.

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,288
Love letters, huh?

17
00:01:12,636 --> 00:01:14,168
I don't get the appeal.

18
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:17,790
They could just say what they want out
loud. Why bother to write it all down?

19
00:01:17,815 --> 00:01:19,551
Must have a lotta time on their hands.

20
00:01:27,389 --> 00:01:29,219
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

21
00:01:29,244 --> 00:01:31,519
Sanae, you're going a little overboard.

22
00:01:31,544 --> 00:01:33,365
One kick was enough.

23
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,587
So kicking him at all's okay?

24
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,592
All right, let's start class.

25
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:42,426
Open up your textbooks to page seventy-six.

26
00:01:47,952 --> 00:01:50,099
Takagi's writing letters, too?

27
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:55,327
Sometimes I forget that she's just your ordinary girl.

28
00:02:11,512 --> 00:02:12,472
What?

29
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:44,976
<b>"Letter"</b>

30
00:03:52,283 --> 00:03:54,047
Is there something wrong, Nishikata?

31
00:03:55,174 --> 00:03:57,020
No, nothing, everything's great!

32
00:03:57,283 --> 00:03:59,453
A letter? Who's it from?

33
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:00,589
And why me?

34
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:03,763
I wonder if some of them are writing love letters, too.

35
00:04:03,806 --> 00:04:06,216
No, no, no, that's obviously not it!

36
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:07,736
Someone's playing a prank on me.

37
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:09,042
Oh, yeah!

38
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:13,729
This could be Takagi's doing.

39
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,538
No, it's gotta be her!

40
00:04:17,816 --> 00:04:18,874
Takagi...

41
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:20,649
Wait a second.

42
00:04:20,776 --> 00:04:22,066
Reign it in, Nishikata!

43
00:04:22,146 --> 00:04:24,346
What if it's somebody else? What if it isn't Takagi?

44
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:27,672
If she finds out I got a letter,
she'll just use that to tease me again!

45
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:30,145
Yeah? What is it?

46
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:30,785
Uh...

47
00:04:31,553 --> 00:04:32,630
Oh, uh...

48
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:39,493
I was just thinking.

49
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,572
It's nice out.

50
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:42,512
Are you hiding something?

51
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:45,517
Why would I be hiding something?

52
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:47,152
Hmm...

53
00:04:47,693 --> 00:04:50,236
Dunno. But you're suspicious.

54
00:04:50,673 --> 00:04:51,884
And blushing, too.

55
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:54,157
You're just imagining things.

56
00:04:54,383 --> 00:04:55,350
Well, maybe.

57
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,156
But why is your textbook closed?

58
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,864
Well. You see, I uh...

59
00:05:01,156 --> 00:05:03,656
I bet it's why your face is red.

60
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:06,238
No, it's not! And my face is not red!

61
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,726
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

62
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:10,388
Yes, that's why I said so!

63
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,208
I guess I was imagining things.

64
00:05:18,513 --> 00:05:20,913
By the way, that letter in your textbook.

65
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:22,800
I put that there.

66
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,647
I knew it!

67
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:31,786
Yeah. I knew that.

68
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,927
I mean, duh. It was obvious.

69
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,395
You liar.

70
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,425
What are you talking about? I'm not lying.

71
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,650
I was just having fun making you squirm.

72
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,329
So. You gonna read what's inside?

73
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:44,600
You wrote something?

74
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:46,757
Well, it is a letter.

75
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:51,923
You're just messing with me like always, aren't you?

76
00:05:55,116 --> 00:05:57,316
Why aren't you saying something?

77
00:05:57,843 --> 00:05:59,374
Okay.

78
00:05:59,672 --> 00:06:01,116
I'll read it at home later.

79
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:03,037
Read it now.

80
00:06:04,216 --> 00:06:05,438
What? Why now?

81
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,955
Because. School's over after this period.

82
00:06:09,323 --> 00:06:11,158
And I wanted an answer by then.

83
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:12,626
An answer?

84
00:06:15,882 --> 00:06:20,016
If it's a letter that needs an answer,
then it's a letter asking a question.

85
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:22,753
Does that mean it's not just meant to mess with me?

86
00:06:23,401 --> 00:06:26,036
I wonder if some of them are writing love letters, too.

87
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:28,366
What if Takao's right?

88
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,784
What if it's a love letter?

89
00:06:29,926 --> 00:06:31,371
Is that even possible?

90
00:06:33,413 --> 00:06:37,063
By any chance, would this
happen to be a love letter, or...?

91
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,792
What's with the silence?!

92
00:06:42,313 --> 00:06:43,665
Why don't you just read it?

93
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,030
Uh, I will, just gimme a minute.

94
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:47,992
I gotta open it up first.

95
00:06:48,782 --> 00:06:53,086
Based on that reaction, I'd wager anything
that this is designed just to tease me.

96
00:06:53,376 --> 00:06:57,330
Whatever it ends up saying, I have to be firm
and confident so that she doesn't get the chance.

97
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,191
Be bold! Be brave!

98
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:01,023
But what if...

99
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,501
No, it can't be.

100
00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:04,941
Why would it be?

101
00:07:05,616 --> 00:07:06,785
There's no way!

102
00:07:07,823 --> 00:07:12,683
But if it is a love letter, then... I...

103
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,370
You could have just asked me to my face.

104
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:39,713
But everyone's writing letters now. It's cool.

105
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:45,459
However, I was also curious how you'd react.

106
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:50,810
So I was right! You were messing with me!

107
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:52,860
Shut it, Nishikata!

108
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:10,223
<b>"First Day of School"</b>

109
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,588
Thanks a lot.

110
00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:20,436
I appreciate it, young man.

111
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:22,565
Welcome. I gotta go now.

112
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,267
Oh, one second!

113
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:28,613
What's your name, new kid?

114
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:30,726
Did I forget to say?

115
00:08:31,506 --> 00:08:32,564
I'm Nishikata.

116
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:36,505
Nishikata. Congrats on getting in!

117
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,084
Mm-hmm.

118
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,884
Thanks.

119
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:46,617
You'll all be learning alongside each
other over the course of the next year.

120
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:49,425
I'm not gonna force you to get along with everybody.

121
00:08:49,546 --> 00:08:53,097
But I hope you realize you're only gonna
make the experience worse if you don't.

122
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,913
Oh, no, did I lose it somewhere?

123
00:08:56,553 --> 00:09:00,433
Well, I don't want to bore you right
off the bat with a long speech, so...

124
00:09:02,386 --> 00:09:04,026
Slept in on the first day?

125
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,999
No, I was, uh...

126
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:08,326
If nothing else, I admire your audacity.

127
00:09:08,383 --> 00:09:09,832
But... Sir, I...

128
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:10,969
What's your name?

129
00:09:12,393 --> 00:09:13,863
It's Nishikata.

130
00:09:14,256 --> 00:09:16,457
All right, then. Sit down.

131
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,844
Uh... Yes, sir.

132
00:09:25,337 --> 00:09:27,802
Oh, great, Everyone's staring.

133
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,129
I have to make friends with people and clear things up

134
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:33,067
before I become known as "that
guy who was late on day one."

135
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:37,209
Mr. Tanabe, a moment of your time?

136
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:41,996
They called and said they're running a little bit late.

137
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:42,903
Really?

138
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:45,011
Are we pushing the entrance ceremony back?

139
00:09:45,036 --> 00:09:46,531
Yes, I'll keep you posted.

140
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:50,906
I just got word that the entrance
ceremony is running behind schedule.

141
00:09:50,953 --> 00:09:53,351
Sounds like it's gonna take a
while before they're all set up.

142
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,170
So in the meantime...

143
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:57,697
...we're figuring out seating.

144
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:05,770
At least I'm not in the front. Sucks to be you.

145
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,038
Oh, come on.

146
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,235
I'm literally as far in the corner as I possibly can be.

147
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:14,369
Normally I'd be happy about being
this far away from the teacher.

148
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:15,909
It's the best spot to goof off.

149
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,839
But I don't know anyone as it is!

150
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:20,561
There's no one behind me or to my left.

151
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:23,302
Worse, I'm sitting next to a girl.

152
00:10:25,372 --> 00:10:27,082
Did you actually sleep in?

153
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:29,676
She's talking to me.

154
00:10:29,843 --> 00:10:32,683
It looked like you were about
to say something to the teacher.

155
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:34,083
Uh... Yeah.

156
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:36,907
No. I didn't actually sleep in.

157
00:10:38,386 --> 00:10:40,251
If only I'd made it here earlier.

158
00:10:40,893 --> 00:10:42,732
I was at the school on time, but...

159
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,691
It's Takagi's fault.

160
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,071
Whoever that is.

161
00:10:46,336 --> 00:10:46,877
Huh?

162
00:10:47,676 --> 00:10:49,694
All right everyone, head to the gym.

163
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,980
Let's keep quiet.

164
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,040
And no running

165
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:54,877
Okay.

166
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:57,240
Hey!

167
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:00,262
You want to walk there together?

168
00:11:00,336 --> 00:11:01,242
Sure.

169
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,251
Wait a second.

170
00:11:09,563 --> 00:11:13,240
You will soon be given a great gift, the right to vote.

171
00:11:13,336 --> 00:11:16,770
With it, you will choose students
for positions of responsibility.

172
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:21,140
It's important you select politicians
who are worthy of your trust and confidence.

173
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:25,979
Similarly, your mothers and fathers
choose their representatives by voting...

174
00:11:28,616 --> 00:11:30,958
Wasn't that speech crazy long?

175
00:11:31,103 --> 00:11:34,196
That dude was talking so long I almost fell asleep!

176
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:37,340
I know, it was like when we started elementary school.

177
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,523
You're pretty cool for coming' in late on the first day.

178
00:11:41,548 --> 00:11:42,903
I didn't mean to.

179
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:45,100
Everybody quit yapping' and take your seats.

180
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,773
I'm sorry for getting back late, sir.

181
00:11:58,882 --> 00:12:00,060
Just go sit down.

182
00:12:00,873 --> 00:12:04,927
That's it for today, but remember,
real classes start tomorrow.

183
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,689
Don't mess around because I'm letting you out early.

184
00:12:07,796 --> 00:12:08,804
Go straight home.

185
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:11,567
Hey, Nishikata.

186
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,717
How 'bout I try to guess why you were late today?

187
00:12:16,323 --> 00:12:17,411
I bet I can.

188
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,853
If I get it right on my first try, I win.

189
00:12:22,086 --> 00:12:23,255
Sure, I guess.

190
00:12:23,506 --> 00:12:26,509
Wait, how is she gonna figure it out on her first try?

191
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:31,813
You were delivering a lost item.

192
00:12:31,953 --> 00:12:33,359
What? How'd you know?

193
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,229
Hey. Quiet down, Nishikata.

194
00:12:36,337 --> 00:12:37,507
I'm sorry, sir.

195
00:12:39,553 --> 00:12:40,597
How did you know?

196
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,318
How indeed.

197
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:55,092
Uh... Wait.

198
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,592
You're Takagi?

199
00:12:57,196 --> 00:13:00,066
You weren't here yet when everyone introduced themselves.

200
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:11,554
What's with that reaction?

201
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:12,925
Hey! I just said to be quiet!

202
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:13,728
Sorry!

203
00:13:21,683 --> 00:13:23,803
Thanks a lot. For picking it up.

204
00:13:27,426 --> 00:13:29,397
It's nice to meet you.

205
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:34,497
It's nice to meet you, too.

206
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,736
<b>"Seating Arrangement"</b>

207
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:43,212
Seventy-two! Seventy-three!

208
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:48,762
Seventy-four! Seventy-five!

209
00:13:55,964 --> 00:13:58,194
All this work's finally starting' to pay off!

210
00:14:09,346 --> 00:14:10,175
Oh, man.

211
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,206
She's not here yet.

212
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:46,696
Morning, Nishikata.

213
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,743
Oh, good morning yourself, Takagi!

214
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,232
So, hey. Have you heard?

215
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:58,391
They're going to be changing where everyone sits today.

216
00:15:04,122 --> 00:15:05,363
Really? When?

217
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,177
During homeroom.

218
00:15:07,202 --> 00:15:09,212
Homeroom? That's first period!

219
00:15:22,552 --> 00:15:22,944
Taka...

220
00:15:22,968 --> 00:15:23,933
Are you okay?

221
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:30,709
First period, huh?

222
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:32,429
That'll be kinda fun.

223
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:34,396
Yeah?

224
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:39,397
Well, I mean, we haven't had a
seating change in a while, so...

225
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,189
Yeah, sure.

226
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:50,513
I guess there are always positives.

227
00:15:51,196 --> 00:15:52,776
But if I'm being honest.

228
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:55,156
I wanted to be next to you for a while longer.

229
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:00,646
She's just messing with me again.

230
00:16:01,012 --> 00:16:02,500
I almost fell for it.

231
00:16:19,356 --> 00:16:22,510
Does anyone still need a number? No?

232
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:25,461
Then move your desks according to the layout on the board.

233
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:27,215
What number did you draw?

234
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:28,442
Twenty-nine.

235
00:16:29,912 --> 00:16:32,362
Oh. The far back again, then.

236
00:16:32,946 --> 00:16:33,816
What about you?

237
00:16:34,972 --> 00:16:37,828
This time I'm front and center.

238
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:38,915
Oh.

239
00:16:41,886 --> 00:16:43,416
We're going to be pretty far.

240
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:44,830
Yeah.

241
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,737
Later.

242
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,497
All right! Now you can sneak me answers on all our tests!

243
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:53,975
What? That's cheating.

244
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,055
I'm not doing that.

245
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,385
It's called mutual aid.

246
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,249
Oh, yeah?

247
00:16:57,274 --> 00:16:58,604
Well what do I get out of it?

248
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:00,345
Words of encouragement from your friend!

249
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,226
Yay...

250
00:17:01,763 --> 00:17:03,101
Yo, Nishikata.

251
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,514
Are you sitting' here?

252
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:05,883
Nah, over there.

253
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,956
Oh, yeah?

254
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:09,579
That's too bad. I was hoping we'd be closer.

255
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,790
Yeah, me too.

256
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:15,882
My vision's been getting really bad lately.

257
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:17,655
I hope I can see what's on the board.

258
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,984
Oh. So that's it.

259
00:17:36,153 --> 00:17:38,077
I'm next to Nishikata, huh?

260
00:17:38,803 --> 00:17:39,872
You okay, Mano?

261
00:17:39,896 --> 00:17:42,451
Yeah. I'm just great.

262
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,002
What's up? Are you not happy?

263
00:17:47,513 --> 00:17:50,691
It's nothing. Feel free to just ignore me.

264
00:17:51,342 --> 00:17:54,227
I'm just depressed because I'm not sitting near Nakai.

265
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:56,948
I was really hoping we'd be next to each other.

266
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,277
How far away is he?

267
00:18:03,053 --> 00:18:04,763
Hey.

268
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:06,327
Someone!

269
00:18:06,723 --> 00:18:09,433
Anyone! Please switch seats with me!

270
00:18:09,592 --> 00:18:14,225
How am I supposed to sneak an early
lunch if I'm right in front of the teacher?

271
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,924
You aren't switching seats
unless you have a legitimate reason.

272
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,600
Also, Kimura.

273
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,820
Please, do see me after class.

274
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:24,826
Right in front of the teacher?

275
00:18:25,676 --> 00:18:29,620
But if I'm being honest. I wanted
to be next to you for a while longer.

276
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:48,529
Hey, Kimura, listen!

277
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,595
I can't see the board from here; let's switch!

278
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,805
Oh. Thanks!

279
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,470
But I already found someone.

280
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,165
It's not like I care.

281
00:19:09,086 --> 00:19:11,873
Nishikata. Hey.

282
00:19:20,946 --> 00:19:22,030
What the...?

283
00:19:23,013 --> 00:19:25,074
Guess what? I'm sitting here now.

284
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:26,447
Wha...? But how?

285
00:19:27,052 --> 00:19:29,371
Well, first Nakai and Kimura switched.

286
00:19:29,396 --> 00:19:31,739
Because Nakai couldn't see the board well enough.

287
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,887
So Nakai was all the way up front.

288
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:38,108
When she saw that, Mano wanted to switch
with me, since I was right next to him.

289
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,118
Mano's short, so she prefers the front anyway.

290
00:19:41,863 --> 00:19:43,800
Oh. I see.

291
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,195
Nishikata.

292
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,192
You tried to sit next to me up there, didn't you?

293
00:19:51,203 --> 00:19:52,167
No, I...

294
00:19:53,236 --> 00:19:55,306
I couldn't see the board well from here.

295
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:57,149
Hmm?

296
00:19:57,726 --> 00:19:58,537
Oh, yeah?

297
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,567
Mmm?

298
00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:05,597
What? It's true!

299
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:07,708
All right, we're starting class.

300
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:09,054
Get your textbooks out.

301
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,675
Oh. That reminds me.

302
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,267
What was it that you wanted to say earlier today?

303
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:15,168
What, did I read you wrong?

304
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:17,123
I thought you were looking for an opportunity.

305
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:25,598
Sorry.

306
00:20:25,973 --> 00:20:28,023
It took me a while to return this.

307
00:20:28,586 --> 00:20:29,249
Thank you.

308
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,032
From over summer break?

309
00:20:32,343 --> 00:20:33,406
Uh... Yeah.

310
00:20:33,913 --> 00:20:35,327
From then, and...

311
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:36,924
The first day of school?

312
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,480
You remembered that?

313
00:20:38,742 --> 00:20:40,889
Of course I did. You did too.

314
00:20:45,306 --> 00:20:46,882
Heh! Thank you.

315
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,340
I made sure to wash it for you.

316
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,300
Oh, nothing.

317
00:20:56,393 --> 00:20:58,584
I'm just kinda glad.

318
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,413
Why?

319
00:20:59,437 --> 00:21:00,791
Oh. Y'know...

320
00:21:00,986 --> 00:21:01,817
For a lot.

321
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:04,496
That I got to return your handkerchief.

322
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,450
And that we ended up next to each other again, oh!

323
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:08,342
And also...

324
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,675
Well, yeah.

325
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:12,689
I'm looking forward to this.

326
00:21:12,723 --> 00:21:15,113
So here, we'd say, "I do not agree."

327
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:18,161
Or you could contract it to, "I don't agree."

328
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:20,135
That part's pretty easy.

329
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,893
But on the next page, things
get a little more complicated.
