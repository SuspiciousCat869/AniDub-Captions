1
00:00:02,406 --> 00:00:04,320
Forget the test!

2
00:00:04,393 --> 00:00:07,327
I'm gonna die if I have to study any longer!

3
00:00:07,352 --> 00:00:08,574
I'm hitting' the arcade.

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:10,352
Well, we can't let you go alone!

5
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:12,360
Hey, Nishikata, are you coming'?

6
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:15,712
I don't know about you, but when I
study for too long, it just doesn't stick.

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,392
Uhh.

8
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,080
Sorry, I think I'm gonna stay.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,622
You've made your choice!

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,464
Later!

11
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,450
What are you guys gonna play?

12
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:26,678
Whichever gets me one of those cute figures.

13
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,620
Man.

14
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:28,620
I'm jealous.

15
00:00:28,682 --> 00:00:30,700
But I can't think about them.

16
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,040
I have to get a good grade on my next test!

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,915
Or else!

18
00:00:34,173 --> 00:00:34,789
Hey.

19
00:00:35,589 --> 00:00:36,731
Can I sit here?

20
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,853
Studying for the test?

21
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,273
Yeah. I am.

22
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,887
<b>"Studying for the Test"</b>

23
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,637
I just saw your friends leaving as I came in.

24
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,617
Yeah.

25
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,130
We were all studying together for a while.

26
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:28,349
Ahh...

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,306
Well I heard them talking,

28
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,750
and I figured they were on their way to the arcade.

29
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:34,658
Are you not going with them?

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,418
I don't have time to play around like they do.

31
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:42,127
If I don't score within the top
fifty of my grade on this test.

32
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,029
My parents are taking away my video games.

33
00:02:45,263 --> 00:02:46,109
Huuuh.

34
00:02:47,263 --> 00:02:48,684
I see.

35
00:02:50,906 --> 00:02:51,951
Oh, no!

36
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,806
Why am I telling her everything?

37
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,750
Now that she knows, she's totally
gonna distract me from studying!

38
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,350
Nice going, me.

39
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,371
I... was just kidding?

40
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,366
About what?

41
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:09,536
Ugh. Forget it.

42
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,368
Anyway, don't interrupt me this time.

43
00:03:12,796 --> 00:03:13,942
That's mean.

44
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:16,299
You say that like I'm always getting in your way.

45
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,639
That's because you are!

46
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,377
Well, yeah. It's 'cuz it's so fun to tease you, Nishikata!

47
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:26,187
Should I study somewhere else?

48
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:29,033
No, if I did that, I'd basically be letting her win.

49
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:34,017
I just realized.

50
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,178
You're not studying?

51
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:36,371
Nope.

52
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:39,539
I like to limit myself to two hours of studying a day.

53
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:40,332
Oh.

54
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,600
I shouldn't be surprised.

55
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,937
She easily scores in the top
ten of our grade all the time.

56
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,420
But, what does she have up her sleeve?

57
00:03:51,323 --> 00:03:53,265
This is Takagi we're talking about.

58
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,350
She's definitely gonna try to mess with me.

59
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,385
I mean, how could she not?

60
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:59,097
It's practically in her blood!

61
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,152
Hmm? What's up?

62
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:02,919
Huh? Oh, nothing, just thinking.

63
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,170
It's not like I was looking at you.

64
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,271
I just kinda spaced out...

65
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:08,264
By the way, you got that one wrong.

66
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:14,422
Problem six, where it says, "Solve for x
over negative two plus three y." That one.

67
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,750
You mean it's not 15?

68
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,670
Mm-hmm.

69
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:18,993
What? Really?

70
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,039
Mm-hmm.

71
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:23,383
Substitute the numbers.

72
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,580
Was that wrong?

73
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,423
No. So then...

74
00:04:30,246 --> 00:04:31,644
Here we go.

75
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,307
Uh... What are you...?

76
00:04:38,176 --> 00:04:40,146
It's easier to teach you this way.

77
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:43,175
So, x equals negative 16...

78
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,211
"Easier to."

79
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,706
She's teaching me?

80
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,115
What is she planning?

81
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,090
Write it out. Go ahead.

82
00:04:51,885 --> 00:04:55,415
There's a negative times a negative
and don't forget order of operations.

83
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,000
It's "PEMDAS" remember?

84
00:04:57,025 --> 00:04:57,840
Oh yeah!

85
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,360
Then let's see.

86
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,580
It's five!

87
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,046
Yep. That's right!

88
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh! And for these next ones, you should be able...

89
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:06,315
She's amazing.

90
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,673
She can figure it out with just a glance.

91
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,790
Hey. I appreciate this.

92
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:13,112
I was really struggling with this page before.

93
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,822
Why don't I teach you from the beginning?

94
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,705
She's gonna teach me the whole thing?

95
00:05:19,947 --> 00:05:21,214
I'm saved!

96
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,317
No, something's fishy here!

97
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,211
Why is she being so nice? She's
never this nice unless she's teasing me!

98
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,136
Hey, Takagi.

99
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:33,294
Why are you being so nice to me today?

100
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,353
Hmm?

101
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:35,594
What do you mean?

102
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:39,577
Well, you're just being kinder than usual.

103
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,363
So...

104
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,370
Oh... Right.

105
00:05:43,457 --> 00:05:46,328
I am always teasing you in the middle of class.

106
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:50,467
I would feel really bad if your
grades went down because of me.

107
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:53,084
Nishikata.

108
00:05:54,627 --> 00:05:57,100
I'm sorry for teasing you every single day.

109
00:05:57,163 --> 00:05:59,100
Let me help you get a better grade.

110
00:06:00,836 --> 00:06:01,959
Takagi.

111
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:04,796
I don't believe it.

112
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,529
You've finally seen the error in your ways!

113
00:06:08,223 --> 00:06:10,119
All right, let's go for it!

114
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:14,457
Thanks for the juice.

115
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,624
No, thank you.

116
00:06:15,731 --> 00:06:18,781
I made huge progress on my math
today, because I had your help.

117
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,904
Now I'm less likely to have my games taken away.

118
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:27,796
Maybe Takagi is actually a good person, after all.

119
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:30,099
Really.

120
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,608
Thank you so much for today.

121
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,700
Oh, no.

122
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,210
You shouldn't thank me.

123
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,457
Since what I taught you, won't be on the test.

124
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,845
Wha... Hey! Hold on!

125
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,887
You're good at substitution now, right?

126
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,370
Yeah, and a lot of good that'll do!

127
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,352
Gimme back that juice right now!

128
00:06:52,377 --> 00:06:53,405
Oops, I already opened it.

129
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,819
You literally just opened it!

I think I did pretty well.

133
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:07,300
I should've gotten a 90 at least.

134
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,160
Hey, Yukari?

135
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,972
Can you teach me this?

136
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,689
I just can't seem to do well in English.

137
00:07:14,714 --> 00:07:17,795
Huh? You make it sound like
you're good at everything else.

138
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,806
No, I'm just extra bad at English!

139
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,620
Anyway!

140
00:07:21,722 --> 00:07:22,602
Help me out here!

141
00:07:22,627 --> 00:07:23,413
In this part...

142
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,790
Sorry, no can do.

143
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,885
I want to review before the next test, too.

144
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:31,975
Huh?! But you always help me study between tests!

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,410
This time is different.

146
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,847
If I can get a 90 or above on everything,
my parents are buying me any game I want.

147
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,290
Cool. So this part's been really tripping me up.

148
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,771
Were you listening?

149
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,750
I don't have the time to teach
you guys this stuff last minute.

150
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,266
Meanie!

151
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,086
Buzz off. Shoo.

152
00:07:48,486 --> 00:07:49,446
What's more important?

153
00:07:49,471 --> 00:07:51,595
Our friendship or some stupid game?

154
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,765
Yeah, what she said.

155
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,345
Sure you can play video games,

156
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,500
but you can't teach them like you can your best friends!

157
00:07:56,525 --> 00:07:58,152
Yeah, what she said.

158
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:04,190
Now that those two academic train wrecks
will leave me alone, I should review.

159
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,546
All right, I'm handing out the next test.

160
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:09,493
Take one and pass it back.

161
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,370
Okay, I've thoroughly reviewed
the material right before the test.

162
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:16,584
Now that I've got English fresh
in the brain, this'll be a...

163
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,566

00:08:30,817 --> 00:08:32,675
You're looking nervous over there.

170
00:08:32,993 --> 00:08:33,823
No, I'm not.

171
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,763
Takagi.

172
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:36,480
Yes!

173
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:41,372
You did very well, as usual.

174
00:08:41,476 --> 00:08:42,982
She's so smart.

175
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:46,612
Sounds like you did fine Takagi.

176
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:48,700
Can we compare answers later?

177
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:49,439
Sure.

178
00:08:49,934 --> 00:08:50,540
So.

179
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,775
You get a good grade?

180
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,790
Yeah, but not a hundred percent.

181
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,450
That sounds about right.

182
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,520
But I got this one in the bag, too.

183
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,950
Next up, Nishikata!

184
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,927
Right!

185
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:04,916
You can do a little better next time.

186
00:09:08,853 --> 00:09:10,157
Was it that bad?

187
00:09:10,703 --> 00:09:12,243
As if you care at all!

188
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:14,499
You're the one who taught me
stuff that wasn't on the test!

189
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,391
All up on your high horse because
you got a good score! Whatever!

190
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:19,681
Hey. Hey!

191
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:21,513
Guess my score.

192
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:22,896
And I'll guess yours.

193
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,157
Whoever gets closer will win.

194
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:27,858
You're always proposing this stuff out of nowhere.

195
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:29,292
But okay.

196
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:32,816
Uh... Is it around 50?

197
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:33,448
Hmph!

198
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,700
You underestimate me too much, Takagi.

199
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,139
You think so?

200
00:09:37,783 --> 00:09:41,206
Okay, then did you get above 60 percent?

201
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:44,920
I'll take that as a no.

202
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,353
How did she know?

203
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,024
Give her your poker face.

204
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:50,987
Confuse her with your world class, unwavering poker face!

205
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,258
Did you get above 55?

206
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,620
That's a yes.

207
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,760
Why?

208
00:09:59,263 --> 00:10:02,132
That leaves everything between 55 and 59.

209
00:10:02,465 --> 00:10:05,067
I have to keep her from guessing the exact score!

210
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,959
Okay, then.

211
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,026
Fifty-six?

212
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:10,719
Or...

213
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,845
Fifty-seven?

214
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,520
Fifty-eight?

215
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:17,824
Fifty-nine?

216
00:10:19,146 --> 00:10:19,890
Yup.

217
00:10:20,623 --> 00:10:21,738
I got it.

218
00:10:22,636 --> 00:10:24,373
You got a 56.

219
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,500
Uhh. Is that the answer you're going with?

220
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,618
Mm-hmm.

221
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,885
Ready to know the truth?

222
00:10:33,936 --> 00:10:35,500
I got a 59!

223
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:37,001
Sucks to be you!

224
00:10:37,026 --> 00:10:39,066
I guess you were sorta close, though.

225
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:40,823
Hey, quiet down.

226
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,596
The only thing that sucks is your grade.

227
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,539
You're right; I'm sorry.

228
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,345
Fifty-nine, huh?

229
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,319
Looks like I was off by three.

230
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,697
All right.

231
00:10:53,864 --> 00:10:56,341
Now it's your turn to try and guess my score okay?

232
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,160
If it's within two percent.

233
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,536
Then you're the winner.

234
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,805
Bring it on!

235
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:05,225
I'm gonna figure it out based on her
reactions. The teacher praised her a second ago,

236
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,618
so I bet that means she got above a 90.

237
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:11,302
Is it... like, a 92?

238
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,155
Uh...

239
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,257
Huh?

240
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,620
What kinda reaction was that?

241
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:19,028
How about a 95?

242
00:11:20,378 --> 00:11:21,558
Ninety?

243
00:11:23,675 --> 00:11:25,425
Or was it 92?

244
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,422
Uh...

245
00:11:29,953 --> 00:11:31,711
She is so faking it!

246
00:11:31,736 --> 00:11:33,020
I'm not gonna fall for that!

247
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,314
She'd never make her reaction so obvious!

248
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,996
She's mocking me.

249
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:39,728
I'm gonna do everything within my power to win this!

250
00:11:40,976 --> 00:11:43,546
Maybe if I focus more on her expression.

251
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,397
What? What's wrong?

252
00:11:48,965 --> 00:11:51,055
Hmm? Oh, nothing.

253
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,887
I was just thinking about something.

254
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:56,741
We've been staring at each other for a long time.

255
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:02,595
Why are you turning away?

256
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,535
Aww come on, that was a cheap shot!

257
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:06,543
I can't look at you after you say that!

258
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:08,159
Think. Just think.

259
00:12:08,563 --> 00:12:10,288
Anything that could clue you in.

260
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,569
That reaction she gave me before was so fake it's painful,

261
00:12:14,663 --> 00:12:17,863
which means she probably wants me to think she got a 92.

262
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:23,373
That also means it won't be between 90 and 94
because they're all within a two point difference of 92!

263
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:27,346
And like I thought before, the teacher
praised her so it must be above 90 percent.

264
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,164
And she said it wasn't 100,

265
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:33,475
so that means it's gotta be between 95 and 99!

266
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,910
Perfect.

267
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,517
Flawless victory!

268
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,100
Takagi.

269
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:41,668
I know what grade you got on the test.

270
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,963
You scored a 97 percent!

271
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,719
Wrong. I got a 92.

272
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:50,939
Wha?! Come on!

273
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:53,873
You really don't trust me enough.

274
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,141
I guess I gave you that
three-point handicap for nothing, huh?

275
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:11,364
<b>"Bookstore"</b>

276
00:13:20,673 --> 00:13:21,767
Coast is clear.

277
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:26,384
Find everything okay?

278
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,507
Four hundred and twenty yen is your total.

279
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,265
You're quick with that exact change.

280
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,100
Want a cov...?

281
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:35,715
No, thank you.

282
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:36,403
A bag...?

283
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:37,192
No, thank you.

284
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,000
A rece...? No, thank you.

285
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,885
Operation successful.

286
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,490
Now to begin phase two: Get home and read it!

287
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:45,298
Oh hey.

288
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,518
Good morning.

289
00:13:49,006 --> 00:13:50,265
Takagi?

290
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,675
What is she doing here?

291
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,805
I'm taking a walk.

292
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,299
Did she just read my mind?

293
00:13:54,324 --> 00:13:56,179
What are you doing here all by yourself?

294
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,319
This is bad!

295
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,261
I can't let her see what I just bought.

296
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,300
I'll have to deny it all the way to my grave.

297
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,770
Oh, nothing.

298
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,620
It's just that I wanted to buy
a book, but they were sold out...

299
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,276
Wait, wait!

300
00:14:07,342 --> 00:14:08,641
What if she saw me at the register?

301
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,520
Reel it in!

302
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:13,970
So I decided to buy <i>Fierce!!
Ultimate Soccer!!</i> volume eleven instead!

303
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,330
The perfect answer!

304
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,750
Boys love that series, but I've never
met a girl who'd give it the time of day.

305
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,509
You won't care to ask more about it.

306
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:22,153
I'm on a roll today.

307
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,305
<i>Fierce-Soccer</i>? Cool, let me see!

308
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:25,134
Huh?!

309
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:28,179
Uh, but I haven't read it yet.

310
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,527
Can I at least see the front cover?

311
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,174
No!

312
00:14:31,297 --> 00:14:33,475
'Cuz I haven't had a chance to look at it yet, either.

313
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,446
And it's my manga.

314
00:14:34,471 --> 00:14:35,881
Then, let's look at it together.

315
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,916
I happen to like looking at it alone.

316
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:39,522
Awww...

317
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:41,805
I wouldn't have thought she'd be this interested.

318
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,500
At this rate, she's gonna blow my cover.

319
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,227
Better get away from her and quick.

320
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,470
I'll see you around, Takagi.

321
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:48,350
Huh?

322
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,020
Hello?

323
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,370
Hey, we ran into each other.

324
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,776
Let's walk together.

325
00:14:59,013 --> 00:15:00,223
Okay, fine.

326
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:06,428
It's pretty unusual to run into someone at the
bookstore so far from home this early in the morning.

327
00:15:08,723 --> 00:15:13,303
I can't let Takagi see this manga and yet
here it is, three feet from her in my backpack!

328
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,146
I feel like my heart's in my throat.

329
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:17,167
I wish I were home already.

330
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,627
Hey.

331
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:20,886
Nishikata.

332
00:15:21,606 --> 00:15:23,583
Are you lying to me about anything?

333
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,444
Are you lying?

334
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:29,366
Uh, um...

335
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,187
You didn't buy <i>Fierce-Soccer,</i> did you?

336
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,830
I bet you bought something that you're so
embarrassed to have, you had to lie about it.

337
00:15:36,855 --> 00:15:37,645
Shut up.

338
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,854
That's not...

339
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,450
It's just some manga for girls, right?

340
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,790
<i>100% Unrequited Love</i>?

341
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:46,603
Okay. There's no point in denying it now, but...

342
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:49,211
...how in the world did you figure it out?

343
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,450
Just luck.

344
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,790
I happened to be passing by when I
saw you at the register checking out.

345
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,576
And I could see what you got.

346
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,370
She knew the whole time and was playing me.

347
00:15:58,395 --> 00:15:59,885
Is it because you like the anime?

348
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,998
I didn't know you read that kind of stuff.

349
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,138
Uh, wait up!

350
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:06,839
Please keep it a secret, I
really don't want anyone to know.

351
00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:11,630
Catching it on TV is one thing, but if people
found out I'm actually buying and reading the manga,

352
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:12,790
I'll be a laughingstock.

353
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:13,525
Hmm...

354
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:15,012
What should I do?

355
00:16:15,113 --> 00:16:16,653
I mean, you did lie to me.

356
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:20,650
And that's extra bad, considering
I've never lied to you before.

357
00:16:21,966 --> 00:16:23,140
But I won't tell.

358
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,155
Huh? You're messing with me.

359
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,352
What do you mean?

360
00:16:28,377 --> 00:16:29,121
I'm serious.

361
00:16:29,146 --> 00:16:30,483
Please don't tell anyone!

362
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,845
Yes, sir!

363
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,563
Why are you so enthusiastic?

364
00:16:34,588 --> 00:16:35,461
It feels fake!

365
00:16:35,553 --> 00:16:37,094
You're so persistent.

366
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,989
Uh... Then how about this?

367
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,702
I know your secret,

368
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,232
so it's only fair that I tell you mine, too.

369
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,447
That'll make you feel better, right?

370
00:16:47,763 --> 00:16:49,309
Since you'll have collateral.

371
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:50,235
Huh?

372
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,259
I guess.

373
00:16:52,823 --> 00:16:53,399
All right.

374
00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:54,621
Come closer.

375
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,838
Okay.

376
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,383
Truth is I've always kind of liked you.

377
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:04,322
Huh?

378
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:09,119
Huh?! What did she...?

379
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:09,958
What?

380
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,744
You're bright red!

381
00:17:14,086 --> 00:17:15,586
You blush so quickly.

382
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,772
It's classic.

383
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,344
Since you lied to me at the bookstore.

384
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,990
I figured I'd lie to you as payback.

385
00:17:24,156 --> 00:17:25,366
Oh, a lie.

386
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:27,322
You shocked me for a second.

387
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,638
That was a lie.

388
00:17:28,728 --> 00:17:30,764
Of course it was. Duh, right?

389
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:32,459
See yah!

390
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,996
I'm turning this way now.

391
00:17:34,572 --> 00:17:35,534
"Duh," right.

392
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,680
I'll see you later, bye.

393
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,718
A lie, huh?

394
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,335
Oh, and Nishikata?

395
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,734
I want to read <i>100% Unrequited Love</i> too, so
let me know when you're done and I'll borrow it!

396
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:54,096
Ahh! Don't say it so loud, Takagi!

397
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,773
<b>"Shelter from the Rain"</b>

398
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,996
This downpour came out of nowhere.

399
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:05,359
I wonder if it'll stop soon.

400
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,140
Hmm...

401
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,762
Well, I hope so.

402
00:18:09,473 --> 00:18:12,309
Aww. Even my socks got wet.

403
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,405
How about you? Are you dry?

404
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,687
Oh man, I can kinda see through her shirt.

405
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,042
You hear me?

406
00:18:20,202 --> 00:18:21,782
Uh. Yeah, I heard you.

407
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,370
Yeah.

408
00:18:22,395 --> 00:18:24,152
Calm down, just calm down!

409
00:18:24,227 --> 00:18:27,096
If she realizes I'm panicking, I'll be branded a pervert!

410
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:29,656
Boy, I sure hope this rain will stop soon.

411
00:18:30,086 --> 00:18:33,176
I wanna be home before five, so I
can catch an anime that's on then.

412
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,120
It's <i>Fierce-Soccer</i>, by the way.

413
00:18:35,362 --> 00:18:36,126
Oh yeah?

414
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,635
That's the one you bought at the bookstore, right?

415
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,040
Or no, I'm mistaken. That's <i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

416
00:18:42,142 --> 00:18:44,934
You promised me you were never
going to bring that up again!

417
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,265
What, I can't talk about it?

418
00:18:46,296 --> 00:18:47,785
You know your own secret.

419
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:51,422
I hope this clears up fast.

420
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:54,971
Uhh. Yeah.

421
00:18:58,763 --> 00:18:59,873
Aw man.

422
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,841
This got a little wet, too.

423
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:04,362
Hey, do you have your P.E. shirt on you?

424
00:19:04,387 --> 00:19:06,000
Uh. Yeah, why?

425
00:19:06,053 --> 00:19:07,673
Do you mind if I borrow it?

426
00:19:07,716 --> 00:19:08,694
I'll give it back.

427
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,364
I want to change out of this.

428
00:19:10,389 --> 00:19:11,724
Huh? Wait, what?

429
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:13,708
You want to change into my P.E. shirt?

430
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:14,660
Like, right here?

431
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,646
Yup. My shirt's wet; I feel all gross.

432
00:19:17,671 --> 00:19:18,725
But aren't you...?

433
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,064
And besides, I know you're having
trouble deciding where to look.

434
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,364
Busted.

435
00:19:24,108 --> 00:19:25,528
Can you turn the other way?

436
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:26,596
Y-Yeah.

437
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,365
You managed to stay pretty dry, huh?

438
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,611
How? Oh.

439
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,553
Did you use your bag as an umbrella?

440
00:19:35,953 --> 00:19:36,872
Mm-hmm.

441
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,586
Good thinking.

442
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:42,004
I had to hold my bike, so I couldn't do that.

443
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:43,613
Yeah, that makes sense.

444
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,507
You know, you can look if you want.

445
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,620
Huh? I can look?

446
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:51,133
What are you trying to say?

447
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:53,108
Because I'm done changing.

448
00:19:55,053 --> 00:19:56,845
Why are you so flustered?

449
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,717
She's screwing with me.

450
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,171
Hey.

451
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,668
Wanna make a bet?

452
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:07,351
We can bet on whether or not the rain will
stop by the time the town clock strikes five.

453
00:20:07,396 --> 00:20:09,726
The loser has to do anything the winner wants.

454
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,580
Why not?

455
00:20:10,613 --> 00:20:12,153
Okay, what's your bet?

456
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,838
That it won't stop in time.

457
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,725
Cool.

458
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,933
Then I bet it will.

459
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,950
If the rain stops, I can go home and watch <i>Fierce-Soccer.</i>

460
00:20:20,975 --> 00:20:23,250
If it doesn't, I get to order Takagi around.

461
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,844
It's win-win!

462
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:26,773
There we go.

463
00:20:26,918 --> 00:20:29,265
I feel much better now that I've changed my shirt.

464
00:20:29,323 --> 00:20:30,877
Thanks a bunch, Nishikata.

465
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,441
Yeah, don't mention it.

466
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,871
It does smell kinda sweaty, though.

467
00:20:34,896 --> 00:20:37,394
Of course it does, it's been super-hot out!

468
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,578
Whoa.

469
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:43,700
That shirt touched my skin and now it's touching hers.

470
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:45,865
Agh! Stop it! What am I thinking?

471
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,287
A cat.

472
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:48,853
Oh. Hey.

473
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,920
Are you trying to get out of the rain?

474
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,142
Come here.

475
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:54,493
He's cute, but be careful.

476
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:55,859
He scratches.

477
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,128
Do you want me to give you your shirt back?

478
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,568
No. I'm fine.

479
00:21:04,716 --> 00:21:06,716
Why don't you wear my P.E. shirt?

480
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,530
Huh?

481
00:21:07,555 --> 00:21:10,563
It did get a little wet, but
it's better than what you've got on.

482
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:12,744
And now,

483
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,060
The shirt that touched Takagi's
skin will be touching mine.

484
00:21:17,316 --> 00:21:18,629
Are you done yet?

485
00:21:19,926 --> 00:21:22,037
Come on, you're not supposed to look!

486
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,946
For some reason this feels naughty.

487
00:21:29,117 --> 00:21:30,835
It smells good.

488
00:21:42,336 --> 00:21:43,726
I guess I win.

489
00:21:44,256 --> 00:21:46,062
What should I make you do?

490
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,427
Oh, well.

491
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,217
At least, <i>Fierce-Soccer</i> 'll be on when I get home.

492
00:21:51,296 --> 00:21:53,499
I'll do what she wants and hurry back.

493
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,752
Oh, I know!

494
00:21:54,777 --> 00:21:55,385
Huh?

495
00:21:56,659 --> 00:21:59,799
Now that it's stopped raining,
let's go somewhere before we head home.

496
00:21:59,824 --> 00:22:01,314
Wait, I wanted to...

497
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:03,790
The bet was, the loser does what the winner wants!

498
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,700
Let's go.

499
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,478
Why?!
