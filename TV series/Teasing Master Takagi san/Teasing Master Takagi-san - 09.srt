1
00:00:04,073 --> 00:00:05,240
The day has come.

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,920
I've waited so long!

3
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:12,626
And finally, I got my first cell phone!

4
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,020
<b>"Cell Phone"</b>

5
00:01:48,203 --> 00:01:50,063
And contact added.

6
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,010
Thanks, man.

7
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:52,623
Sure thing.

8
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,451
You got a cell phone?

9
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:04,217
Right on cue!

10
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,204
Oh cool, you got the latest model?

11
00:02:06,337 --> 00:02:08,734
I was thinking of upgrading to that one, myself.

12
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,345
Do you mind if I take a look at it?

13
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,202
Not at all.

14
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,160
Wow. It's lighter than mine.

15
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,830
I've been waiting for this!

16
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,253
With a cell phone,
I can tease her in all sorts of new ways!

17
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,605
Of course, I've got one plan in mind already.

18
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,705
You're going' down, Takagi.

19
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:27,135
Ooo.

20
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,646
That's a cool feature.

21
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,675
Thanks for letting me check it out.

22
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,558
No prob.

23
00:02:42,063 --> 00:02:42,688
Uhh...

24
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,548
Huh?

25
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,570
Ah, it's nothing.

26
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,993
I thought Takagi was gonna ask me for my email for sure.

27
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,460
What now?

28
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:05,181
Something wrong?

29
00:03:05,206 --> 00:03:07,881
Huh? Nope!

30
00:03:08,203 --> 00:03:09,458
Hmm?

31
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,250
Man.

32
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:14,592
If I can't get in touch with
her, I can't execute my plan!

33
00:03:19,513 --> 00:03:21,939
Wait a second, why don't I just ask her then?

34
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,322
Why didn't I think of that
earlier? It's so obvious!

35
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,385
Hey, Takagi?

36
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,100
What is it?

37
00:03:28,782 --> 00:03:29,659
I, uh...

38
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,426
Uh...

39
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,233
Your email address?

40
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:37,216
Hmm?

41
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:39,778
Never mind, wasn't important!

42
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,429
What's going on?

43
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:44,555
Why am I so nervous all of a sudden?

44
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,747
Get it together!

45
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:48,678
I'm just trying to get Takagi's email address!

46
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,778
I didn't really think about it before.

47
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:55,260
But if I'm asking a girl for her email.

48
00:03:57,106 --> 00:03:59,377
Isn't that kinda like...?

49
00:04:01,146 --> 00:04:02,238
Yes, it is!

50
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:05,355
Hey, Nishikata.

51
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,160
There isn't something you want to ask me, is there?

52
00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:09,201
No, not at all!

53
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:11,086
Nope! Not a thing! Really!

54
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:14,650
Hmm...

55
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:16,622
Funny.

56
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:19,482
I was certain you wanted to ask me for my email.

57
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,330
She knows!

58
00:04:21,817 --> 00:04:22,617
Wait!

59
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:24,319
This might be my chance!

60
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:28,526
All I gotta do is say, "Actually,
you're right," and I'll get exactly what I want!

61
00:04:28,952 --> 00:04:30,862
You've grown too careless.

62
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,613
Uh.

63
00:04:34,657 --> 00:04:36,425
Actually, yeah, you're right.

64
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,305
I am? Then why'd you lie about it?

65
00:04:38,426 --> 00:04:39,405
Are you embarrassed?

66
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:40,336
Or what?

67
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:41,607
Huh?

68
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,037
She found a way to flip this one on me.

69
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,905
Uh. Who, me?

70
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:47,843
Embarrassed? No way.

71
00:04:49,386 --> 00:04:50,457
Hmm?

72
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:53,265
I think you are.

73
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,790
It's just good to have in case something happens.

74
00:04:55,815 --> 00:04:57,195
If what happens?

75
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,550
I dunno something.

76
00:04:58,725 --> 00:05:01,823
So who else did you ask?
I'm not the only one, am I?

77
00:05:02,575 --> 00:05:03,123
Nah.

78
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:05,482
So far Kimura and Takao.

79
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:06,890
And Nakai.

80
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,480
That's all?

81
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,790
It's only been a day.

82
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,015
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you've figured it out by now.

83
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,952
You're the first girl I've asked, whatever!

84
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,755
Just hurry up and give it already, this is killing me!

85
00:05:20,869 --> 00:05:21,959
So what?

86
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,554
Do you want to message me?

87
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:27,608
Of course not!

88
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:31,110
I just want your stupid contact info,
so I can tease you when we're not at school!

89
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:33,305
It has nothing to do with wanting to talk to you!

90
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,055
Seriously!

91
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,885
That's all!

92
00:05:34,923 --> 00:05:36,466
It's nothing weird, I swear!

93
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,227
I knew it had to be something like that.

94
00:05:54,616 --> 00:05:57,506
Well, your plan to tease me has been thoroughly crushed.

95
00:05:57,889 --> 00:05:59,400
Do you still want my email?

96
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:07,896
Yeah.

97
00:06:10,546 --> 00:06:12,144
To make up for teasing me.

98
00:06:12,276 --> 00:06:14,644
Help me clean up next week when I'm on day duty.

99
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,781
I didn't tease you, though!

100
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:18,865
I was going to tease you!

101
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,271
Well, yeah.

102
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:22,620
But if I hadn't found out, you would have eventually.

103
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,950
Y-Yeah.

104
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:25,562
Then it's a deal.

105
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:30,416
I'll talk to you soon.

106
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,470
When I get home.

107
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:39,112
She'll talk to me when she gets home?

108
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,842
Does that mean she's gonna
tease me when I'm at home too?

109
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:51,288
I wish I had a cell phone.

110
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,691
But I asked my mom if I could get one yesterday
and she said I was too young to have a phone.

111
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,879
Of course, she'll say no when
you ask her out of the blue.

112
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:02,915
You do say things out of the blue a lot.

113
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,434
Hey, that's not true!

114
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:07,417
For your information, I've wanted one forevs.

115
00:07:07,686 --> 00:07:09,087
How long is "forevs"?

116
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,301
Umm...

117
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,186
If I had to put it into words,

118
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,208
a week?

119
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:18,856
So in not-Mina time, it's been three days, give or take?

120
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,564
Either way, that's still way too sudden.

121
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,180
Dude what's up with that picture?

122
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:25,950
It's ridiculous!

123
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,920
So dumb!

124
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,700
It's Super Ponpoko!

125
00:07:28,855 --> 00:07:32,225
Pon, pon, Po-pon, pon! Pon, pon, Po-pon, pon!

126
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,375
But there's no denying a lot
of kids have them these days.

127
00:07:36,045 --> 00:07:37,585
I guess I kinda want one, too.

128
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,620
I know, right?

129
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:40,232
I wish we all had 'em!

130
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,460
We should totally all bug our
moms till they buy 'em for us!

131
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,359
You want one too, right, Sanae?

132
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,307
No. Not really.

133
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,294
What?

134
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,450
Why the heck not?

135
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,275
We could message each other and stuff!

136
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:53,322
Because, hold on,

137
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,689
I have one.

138
00:07:57,146 --> 00:07:58,897
What? How did that happen?

139
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:02,836
Sometimes I get home late from my club,
so my parents wanted me to have it.

140
00:08:03,106 --> 00:08:04,398
That makes sense.

141
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,150
Still, you should have told us when you got it.

142
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,787
I know!

143
00:08:09,434 --> 00:08:12,742
If I tell my parents Sanae has
one, maybe they'll buy one for me!

144
00:08:12,877 --> 00:08:14,984
Hey. That's not a bad idea.

145
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,210
I'll do the same thing.

146
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,250
This time my mom'll agree for sure!

147
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:20,135
Then I can get a group chat going!

148
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,480
And I can download tons of games
and play them until I fall asleep!

149
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,830
Group chats are the worst

150
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:29,413
That childish attitude is why your
parents don't wanna get you one.

151
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:30,615
I'm not childish!

152
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,940
Hit me with a scary story!

153
00:08:31,965 --> 00:08:34,835
What, you think not getting
scared means you're not childish?

154
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:35,841
Mm-hmm.

155
00:08:36,993 --> 00:08:38,655
Yeah. So what? It's true!

156
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,980
Just tell me one, okay?

157
00:08:41,556 --> 00:08:42,775
Late one night.

158
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,725
You get a call from an unknown number on your new phone.

159
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:48,373
You answer it and hear something soft.

160
00:08:48,398 --> 00:08:50,848
A faint groaning of some sort.

161
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:53,925
You quickly hit "end call,"

162
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:56,107
and never hear from that number again.

163
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:56,882
That's goo...

164
00:08:56,907 --> 00:08:59,562
But you're just so curious, you have to call back.

165
00:09:00,678 --> 00:09:01,595
Why?

166
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,775
But this time, you hear nothing
on the other end of the line.

167
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:06,409
What a relief.

168
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:08,403
At the end of the month.

169
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:13,075
You look at your phone bill and
find a hundred thousand yen charge.

170
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,594
If that happened my parents would kill me!

171
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:20,871
You're gonna kill me if you keep screaming like that!

172
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:25,792
<b>"Horror"</b>

173
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:33,606
Huh? Good morning, Nishikata.

174
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:35,620
Hey. Morning.

175
00:09:35,645 --> 00:09:37,890
I see you decided to keep your promise.

176
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,563
I appreciate that.

177
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:40,806
Well, yeah.

178
00:09:47,176 --> 00:09:47,916
Let me help.

179
00:09:48,473 --> 00:09:49,698
Sure, thank you.

180
00:09:57,857 --> 00:09:59,822
You're looking tired today.

181
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,290
Really?

182
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,272
Guess so.

183
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,623
Were you up late again?

184
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:07,635
Watching a recording of <i>100% Unrequited Love</i>?

185
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,087
Huh? No!

186
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,167
Really?

187
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,713
What was it, then?

188
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:14,346
Nothing worth mentioning.

189
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,132
Were you messaging some of your friends?

190
00:10:17,187 --> 00:10:19,312
Uh. Kinda.

191
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:20,299
What about?

192
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,532
That's weird.

193
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:25,494
It's unusual for her to pry into something this much.

194
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:27,297
Wait a second.

195
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:29,779
Fun, right?

196
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,273
I mean, messaging your friends when
you get your very first cell phone.

197
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:35,962
Honestly, I was hooked when I got mine, too.

198
00:10:37,378 --> 00:10:40,947
And then before you know it,
you end up getting in trouble for doing it too much.

199
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:44,066
Takagi messaged someone enough times to get in trouble?

200
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,041
Who does she know that well?

201
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:48,502
Oh yeah?

202
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:50,805
With a girl from class I assume?

203
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,304
Nope.

204
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,380
Calm down.

205
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:57,580
She's tricked you with something like this before.

206
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,080
The last time I rode on the back of someone's bike.

207
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,699
I was riding with my dad.

208
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:05,737
I know!

209
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,063
Was it your dad?

210
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:09,540
Why would I get in trouble for texting my dad?

211
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,622
Touché.

212
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,928
Curious?

213
00:11:14,872 --> 00:11:15,860
Not really.

214
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,666
If you tell me what you chat about with the
boys, I'll tell you who I was talking about.

215
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:22,859
Sound like a deal?

216
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,379
I don't care that much.

217
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,979
Wait...

218
00:11:29,303 --> 00:11:31,923
I can kill two birds with one stone.

219
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,597
Sorry about this, but your fun stops here, Takagi.

220
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,555
Actually, yesterday we were sharing videos.

221
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,406
Mostly funny ones,
but there were a couple others mixed in.

222
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,272
Hmm?

223
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,800
Like what?

224
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:50,457
Yes, yes, by all means, keep taking the bait.

225
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,645
I'll send her that link that Kimura sent me.

226
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:14,788
It's thanks to this goat I
didn't sleep well last night.

227
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,447
Did you send me something?

228
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,114
Yeah.

229
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:25,216
It's a video of a cute animal
someone sent me last night.

230
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:27,312
It's not some pervy site, right?

231
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:28,479
Of course not!

232
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:29,885
Huh...

233
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:33,068
Let's see then.

234
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,030
It's so scary that you'll be at a loss for words!

235
00:12:39,234 --> 00:12:40,793
Just give it a second.

236
00:12:40,978 --> 00:12:42,242
Nishikata?

237
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:44,028
Yeah? What's up?

238
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,450
Do you like this stuff?

239
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,225
Like, do you look at it all the time?

240
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:50,910
Huh? Huh?!

241
00:12:51,048 --> 00:12:54,230
Whoa, whoa, hold on, why is that
on your phone? What even is that?

242
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,038
It's definitely not what I sent you, is it?

243
00:12:57,745 --> 00:12:59,055
Nope. Just thought I'd ask.

244
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,009
Huh?!

245
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,580
Now then, let's take a look-see at what you sent.

246
00:13:03,703 --> 00:13:04,238
'Kay?

247
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:08,840
This is pathetic, she got me again!

248
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,521
Huh? It is an animal video.

249
00:13:13,663 --> 00:13:14,394
Aww.

250
00:13:14,446 --> 00:13:15,587
He's kinda cute.

251
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:16,741
Is he a goat?

252
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:19,315
Good, good, she's let her guard down.

253
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,428
Here comes the fun part.

254
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:25,635
That's it! That's the part!

255
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,617
Cower in fear, Takagi!

256
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh. Scary.

257
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,250
Huh?!

258
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:35,680
Yeah. It is, right?

259
00:13:35,705 --> 00:13:36,864
Crazy scary.

260
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,950
Yeah, then again.

261
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,769
It's not that scary when you watch it in the morning.

262
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:46,700
I'll give her that.

263
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:50,773
Huh... So this is what you guys talk about.

264
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,463
Boys are into such weird things.

265
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,632
So I held up my end.

266
00:13:55,663 --> 00:13:58,073
What did you talk about with who exactly?

267
00:13:58,173 --> 00:13:59,266
Mmm...

268
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:01,263
Just the usual stuff.

269
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,825
That doesn't answer the question, and you know it!

270
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,980
It doesn't?

271
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:07,704
Well, I talk with someone that starts with "Kuh."

272
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:08,885
Heh.

273
00:14:09,262 --> 00:14:10,499
That's your clue.

274
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:13,775
"Kuh"?

275
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,720
Like, Kaede?

276
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,256
Wrong.

277
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:19,719
After that, is "zih."

278
00:14:19,744 --> 00:14:20,785
Kuh-zih?

279
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,790
Kazi?

280
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,521
Wait, Kazi?

281
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,425
That boy?

282
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:28,175
No, it's not Kazi, either.

283
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,888
But the last bit is "in."

284
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,916
Kuh-zih-in?

285
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:37,312
What?

286
00:14:45,743 --> 00:14:47,125
Ninety-seven.

287
00:14:47,696 --> 00:14:49,012
Ninety-eight.

288
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,870
Ninety-nine!

289
00:14:52,547 --> 00:14:54,261
Freakin' Takagi.

290
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:57,698
I really thought I'd be able to
get back at her for once, today.

291
00:14:58,443 --> 00:15:00,857
But somehow, she outplayed me yet again.

292
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,164
No.

293
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,640
The day's not over yet.

294
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,431
It didn't work in the morning,
but I bet it will at night.

295
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,372
There's an even scarier video Kimura
told me about after school today.

296
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,940
Since it's scary, I haven't watched it myself.

297
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,330
But this will surely freak her ou...

298
00:15:23,807 --> 00:15:25,339
How does she always know?

299
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,712
Why do I get the feeling I'm gonna
have to do more push-ups after this call?

300
00:15:34,313 --> 00:15:35,682
Hello? Nishikata?

301
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:36,602
Yeah?

302
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,065
I was thinking it's about time.

303
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:41,009
Uh. About time for what?

304
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:43,349
For you to send me a scary video.

305
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:46,208
Huh? I dunno what you're talking about.

306
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,516
Huh?

307
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:49,466
Get real, Takagi.

308
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,964
You think I'm gonna reveal my plan just like that?

309
00:15:52,106 --> 00:15:53,776
This battle is far from over...

310
00:15:53,813 --> 00:15:56,546
Just you wait until after we get off the phone.

311
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,981
Huh?!

312
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:00,845
That's what you were thinking.

313
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,082
What? No. Not me, I wasn't.

314
00:16:03,653 --> 00:16:04,344
Really?

315
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,470
Yes, of course, really.

316
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,013
Then, are you going to go to sleep soon?

317
00:16:12,323 --> 00:16:14,901
Uh, yeah. Probably.

318
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,923
I see.

319
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,740
I was just about to do that, too.

320
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,163
Oh. Cool.

321
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:27,906
This feels kind of weird.

322
00:16:28,303 --> 00:16:28,797
Huh?

323
00:16:29,616 --> 00:16:32,586
I don't think we've ever talked
to each other at night before.

324
00:16:33,323 --> 00:16:35,082
Kind of makes my heart flutter.

325
00:16:37,506 --> 00:16:38,756
See you tomorrow, then.

326
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,377
Good night.

327
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,063
Yeah.

328
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,060
G'night to you, too.

329
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,790
Nishikata?

330
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,110
Yeah?

331
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:54,005
You haven't hung up yet.

332
00:16:55,106 --> 00:16:55,817
Why not?

333
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,064
I dunno, I think you should hang up first.

334
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,672
I called you.

335
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:02,354
So you're supposed to hang up.

336
00:17:02,946 --> 00:17:04,008
And why's that?

337
00:17:04,884 --> 00:17:07,306
Okay, okay, on the count of three.

338
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:08,425
We'll both hang up.

339
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:10,699
One, two...

340
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,248
Liar.

341
00:17:15,407 --> 00:17:17,236
C'mon, you didn't hang up either!

342
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:38,869
Man. Two nights in a row I can't sleep.

343
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,726
<b>"Picture"</b>

344
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,453
Those cats are fighting.

345
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:50,744
Give me like two minutes, Takagi!

346
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:52,764
What are you doing?

347
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,772
Good. Just like that.

348
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,276
Stay put right there for me, kitty-cats.

349
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,550
Yes, that's perfect!

350
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:06,480
Great. Add that to my collection of blurry photos.

351
00:18:06,512 --> 00:18:07,442
What's with you?

352
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,872
Into photography now?

353
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,506
No, not particularly.

354
00:18:12,662 --> 00:18:16,212
I'm just competing with the guys to
see who can take the best picture.

355
00:18:16,936 --> 00:18:18,989
Has anyone already taken the lead?

356
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:24,418
Yeah, Kimura's unbeatable with this.

357
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,658
Whoa!

358
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,727
Gotta admire the commitment.

359
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,305
Funny pictures are great.

360
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,638
Mm-hmm.

361
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:34,876
Wait! I've got an idea!

362
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,135
Let me take a picture of that funny face you do!

363
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,988
Huh?

364
00:18:38,013 --> 00:18:40,015
That can totally beat Super Ponpoko!

365
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,783
Help me out!

366
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,060
Hmmm...

367
00:18:42,118 --> 00:18:45,286
I'll agree on the condition that
you do anything I ask of you.

368
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:47,781
Huh? What kind of "anything"?

369
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,277
The word pretty much covers it all.

370
00:18:51,993 --> 00:18:52,932
Scary!

371
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,311
She has what it takes for me to win, but...

372
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,981
Oh. By the way...

373
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:04,764
That's the one!

374
00:19:10,743 --> 00:19:11,962
I did the face.

375
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:13,269
That was your chance.

376
00:19:13,303 --> 00:19:14,765
Wait! Do it again!

377
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,052
No can do.

378
00:19:17,747 --> 00:19:19,222
No, it's okay.

379
00:19:19,463 --> 00:19:20,213
I know her.

380
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:21,488
She enjoys this too much.

381
00:19:21,513 --> 00:19:22,864
She'll want to do it again!

382
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,345
I'll just act as though I'm upset to lead her on.

383
00:19:28,226 --> 00:19:29,220
Hey, guess what?

384
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:29,901
I knew it!

385
00:19:29,926 --> 00:19:31,281
Here's my chance!

386
00:19:38,675 --> 00:19:39,425
Really?

387
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,842
You had a toy snake on you?

388
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:42,199
That's a great picture.

389
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:44,574
Huh!? Wait, you took my picture?!

390
00:19:45,305 --> 00:19:46,845
Hey! Delete that!

391
00:19:47,088 --> 00:19:47,925
No way!

392
00:19:47,956 --> 00:19:49,042
It's too good!

393
00:19:50,449 --> 00:19:51,885
If you do anything I ask,

394
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:53,772
then I'll delete it for you.

395
00:19:55,356 --> 00:19:56,986
Come on, Takagi!

396
00:19:57,093 --> 00:19:59,063
That was a cheap shot, and you know it!

397
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,178
Wow. I got such a great picture.

398
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,212
Do you wanna see it?

399
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,053
No, I definitely don't.

400
00:20:05,082 --> 00:20:06,166
Just look!

401
00:20:10,382 --> 00:20:11,695
You had burst mode on?

402
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,490
Cool, huh?

403
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,950
The way your face changes?

404
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,521
Takagi, you're the worst!

405
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,702
I know!

406
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:30,392
I'll take a picture of her laughing with
her mouth hanging wide open, just like that!

407
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,773
That'll teach her!

408
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:38,187
Do I look okay?

409
00:20:39,674 --> 00:20:41,184
Well, we're even now.

410
00:20:41,362 --> 00:20:43,444
We're not even close to even!

411
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,774
If you want me to delete this shot,
then you gotta delete yours, too.

412
00:20:49,132 --> 00:20:50,111
Nuh-uh.

413
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,231
I'll keep it.

414
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,030
So you don't have to delete my picture, either.

415
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,250
Wait.

416
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,440
But that's not the point.

417
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,082
Well, see ya.

418
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:04,968
Yeah.

419
00:21:07,294 --> 00:21:08,849
She had fun.

420
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:12,360
But I didn't get a single
funny picture to show the guys.

421
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,030
Hey, Nishikata?

422
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,222
Do me a favor, and don't show my picture to anyone.

423
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:22,599
It's embarrassing.

424
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:33,107
Yeah, right.

425
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,042
Like I could show this to anyone!

426
00:21:35,265 --> 00:21:38,292
What would people say about me having a photo like this?

427
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,830
It's not worth keeping!

428
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,927
Better delete it.

429
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,430
She did say it's embarrassing.

430
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,179
So maybe I can use it for some
kind of blackmail one day.

431
00:21:56,086 --> 00:21:57,390
Might as well keep it.
