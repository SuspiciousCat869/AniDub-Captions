1
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:05,193
How to approach a cat.

2
00:00:05,446 --> 00:00:08,615
Step one: Don't make eye contact.

3
00:00:08,755 --> 00:00:12,480
Step two: Assume a crouching posture.

4
00:00:14,623 --> 00:00:16,243
That do anything for ya?

5
00:00:16,499 --> 00:00:19,573
You can tell by my body language
that I'm not a threat, right?

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,845
Step three: Approach ever so slowly.

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,462
This is incredible!

8
00:00:29,573 --> 00:00:31,783
I guess that guy on TV wasn't kidding!

9
00:00:31,896 --> 00:00:33,927
His advice is just what I needed.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,382
Oh, hey! Nishikata!

11
00:00:44,636 --> 00:00:45,918
What were you doing?

12
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:49,431
Nothing.

13
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:23,352
<b>"Cat"</b>

14
00:02:26,642 --> 00:02:28,370
Curse you, Takagi!

15
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:31,483
I was this close to petting
that cat when you came along!

16
00:02:31,893 --> 00:02:32,397
But...

17
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:36,315
On the other hand, I'm glad she
didn't actually see me petting it.

18
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,823
Because if she did...

19
00:02:39,153 --> 00:02:41,498
Ooh, Nishikata's petting a cat!

20
00:02:41,523 --> 00:02:44,255
I thought boys weren't supposed to like cute things.

21
00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:46,859
She'd never let me live it down!

22
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:52,299
And there's no way I'm gonna give
her more ammo to tease me with!

23
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:54,700
Look, a cat.

24
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:55,289
Really?

25
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,925
Oh, wow. You like cats?

26
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,297
Not especially.

27
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,834
Crap! That was close.

28
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:05,429
Here, kitty, kitty.

29
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:08,092
Over here.

30
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:11,723
So naive, Takagi.

31
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,106
Cats are very wary creatures.

32
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:16,143
There's no way one would just waltz right...

33
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:17,704
Come here.

34
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:19,537
Wh-What?!

35
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,263
Why? That wasn't even a proper call!

36
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,209
Unless...

37
00:03:23,426 --> 00:03:25,458
What is she, some sort of cat whisperer?

38
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,425
That's a good boy.

39
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,477
You're looking cuter than usual, Meeta.

40
00:03:30,723 --> 00:03:31,933
Wait, you know this cat?

41
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:35,735
Yep. He belongs to the old lady who
lives around the corner from us.

42
00:03:35,796 --> 00:03:38,546
No wonder! That explains it.

43
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,380
Aww. So soft.

44
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:50,265
He's great. And he really likes people.

45
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,052
He'll let you pet him all you want.

46
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:54,323
Could it really be?

47
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:56,456
The coveted all-you-can-pet cat?

48
00:03:56,763 --> 00:03:58,685
I need him!

49
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:01,590
Why don't you play with him a little?

50
00:04:01,615 --> 00:04:02,912
What? Why would I?

51
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:03,909
Come on.

52
00:04:04,063 --> 00:04:05,864
You were trying to pet the other cat.

53
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:08,461
You used that trick that was on TV yesterday.

54
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
I think you wanna.

55
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,198
She already knows!

56
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,963
I just thought that guy on TV didn't
know what he was talking about, so...

57
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,269
So... You don't particularly like cats or anything?

58
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,340
No. Not really.

59
00:04:22,426 --> 00:04:25,580
And I've definitely never
wanted to pet a cat or anything.

60
00:04:25,605 --> 00:04:27,882
Really? That's surprising.

61
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:30,197
They're just so cute.

62
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:32,095
Their coats are all fluffy.

63
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,294
And their paws are so squishy.

64
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,295
Are you kidding me?

65
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,572
This cat even lets people touch his paws?

66
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,531
I wanna touch!

67
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:44,485
But I can't!

68
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,430
I've dug myself too deep for that!

69
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:48,627
I know!

70
00:04:49,183 --> 00:04:53,301
I really don't get why people are always
going on and on about petting cats.

71
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:56,310
It's not like they're really that cute.

72
00:04:56,716 --> 00:04:58,960
And even if they were, I wouldn't want to touch them.

73
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:01,401
When it comes down to it, they're animals.

74
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:03,257
You can never be sure what they'll do.

75
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:05,740
You're taking a risk every time you approach one.

76
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:09,305
I see what's going on.

77
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,830
You're saying that because you're
afraid of getting scratched.

78
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:13,176
She took the bait!

79
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:15,059
Of course I'm not afraid!

80
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:19,143
But... If you don't believe me, I'll just
have to prove it right now by petting this cat!

81
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,190
That's okay.

82
00:05:20,256 --> 00:05:21,826
I actually believe you now.

83
00:05:22,397 --> 00:05:23,719
Sorry I doubted you.

84
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:33,290
Your face is like an open book, Nishikata!

85
00:05:33,315 --> 00:05:35,402
You really want to pet this cat, huh?

86
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:38,181
Takagi!

87
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:42,027
What'll it be? You gonna
pet him? Or leave him hanging?

88
00:05:45,196 --> 00:05:46,486
I want to pet him.

89
00:05:46,697 --> 00:05:47,750
Is that okay?

90
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:49,547
Mm-hmm.

91
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:51,812
Though I think Meeta has different plans.

92
00:05:51,837 --> 00:05:53,750
What do you mean?! He disappeared?!

93
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:56,449
Yeah. Do you want to go look for a different cat to pet?

94
00:05:56,596 --> 00:05:58,320
We're gonna be late for school.

95
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,008
So I asked, and Satou said
she likes Tanaka from Class 3.

96
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,243
Oh, I called it.

97
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,480
Didn't I call it?

98
00:06:12,236 --> 00:06:15,555
I can't take it anymore!
I want to talk about love!

99
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,680
<b>"Taste"</b>

100
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,364
So I've been doing some thinking.

101
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:25,207
And I was wondering, what's like your type?

102
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:29,031
Was that too abrupt?

103
00:06:29,776 --> 00:06:31,225
I never expected you to ask.

104
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,923
I happen to like the dependent type.

105
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,432
As for me, I prefer a well-built physique and long hair.

106
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,432
Oh, yeah?

107
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,040
I never would have guessed.

108
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:41,475
It's happening!

109
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,330
They're ready to talk about love too!

110
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:44,144
It's funny.

111
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:46,363
You just caught us in the middle of discussing that.

112
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:48,485
Did I really? What a coincidence.

113
00:06:48,573 --> 00:06:50,122
They've both grown so much!

114
00:06:50,162 --> 00:06:52,341
All right. I'm gonna dig deeper here.

115
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:53,821
What's your type, Yukari?

116
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:56,697
I'm so glad you asked!

117
00:06:57,499 --> 00:07:01,539
Well, if I had to choose,
I'd say long legs and handsome features are nice.

118
00:07:01,603 --> 00:07:02,598
What about hair?

119
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,973
She's really particular about a guy's hair.

120
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:07,656
I tend to like longer hair too, like you do.

121
00:07:07,823 --> 00:07:09,555
Ah! This is fun!

122
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,613
I've wanted to have a conversation
like this with friends forever!

123
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,213
So then a borzoi, yeah?

124
00:07:14,238 --> 00:07:16,341
Uh-huh. A borzo... Eh?

125
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:19,238
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?

126
00:07:19,263 --> 00:07:21,371
Dogs, duh. What are you talking about?

127
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:26,169
Which breed is your favorite?

128
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,151
I don't know, Chihuahuas?

129
00:07:28,236 --> 00:07:31,236
What? But they don't fit into your description at all!

130
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:33,677
Well, there are some long-haired Chihuahuas out there.

131
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:37,361
<b>"Portrait"</b>

132
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,732
You gonna draw?

133
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:46,226
Hm?

134
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,367
You're going to run out of time.

135
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:49,880
Yeah.

136
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,906
Why does it have to be a portrait?

137
00:07:58,033 --> 00:07:59,832
Can't we just draw whatever we want?

138
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:10,942
I'm your reference. You have to actually look at me.

139
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,342
I am looking.

140
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:16,440
Everyone?

141
00:08:16,723 --> 00:08:18,675
Remember to observe your subject.

142
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,040
Don't get too focused on drawing or
this'll take longer than necessary.

143
00:08:22,092 --> 00:08:23,592
You need to strike a balance.

144
00:08:23,617 --> 00:08:27,422
Take twice as much time studying your
reference as you do drawing them.

145
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:29,568
You heard her.

146
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:32,522
Yeah, I did.

147
00:08:38,046 --> 00:08:39,153
Why are you laughing?

148
00:08:39,255 --> 00:08:41,385
Oh... Oh, sorry. It's nothing.

149
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:42,614
Yeah, right.

150
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:44,321
What was that all about?

151
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,327
Is there something on my face?

152
00:08:46,352 --> 00:08:50,264
No, there wasn't anything there when I checked
in the bathroom mirror during the break.

153
00:08:51,316 --> 00:08:53,190
What, then? Bed head?

154
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,354
No, I checked my hair, too.

155
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,524
Is she just laughing at my face itself?

156
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:00,795
I can't do anything about that!

157
00:09:01,276 --> 00:09:03,307
Calm down, calm down!

158
00:09:03,663 --> 00:09:06,300
I know. It's just
her usual game.

159
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:10,840
There's nothing wrong... she's just making
me worry so she can enjoy my reaction.

160
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:13,832
Well two can play at that game.

161
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,261
Are you laughing at how bad your drawing is?

162
00:09:21,286 --> 00:09:22,128
I am not!

163
00:09:22,376 --> 00:09:25,386
Then is there something on my
face that's making you laugh?

164
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:26,233
Ugh!

165
00:09:26,313 --> 00:09:28,703
I didn't expect her to just ask me flat out.

166
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:30,164
No, there isn't.

167
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:31,334
Hm?

168
00:09:32,023 --> 00:09:33,929
Oh, good, she backed down.

169
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:36,741
Mina, I told you a hundred times!

170
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:39,635
My eyes don't slant that much, you're exaggerating.

171
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,856
But that's how I envision you, so that's how I drew it.

172
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,327
Don't draw what you see in your mind, draw me!

173
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:45,094
That's it!

174
00:09:46,227 --> 00:09:47,884
This is supposed to be me?

175
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:49,829
Well, yeah, that's how I envision you.

176
00:09:49,936 --> 00:09:51,171
I can't help it.

177
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,626
That'll teach her.

178
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:03,136
Okay. Only ten minutes left.

179
00:10:03,663 --> 00:10:05,840
Oh, this is gonna be good.

180
00:10:06,376 --> 00:10:07,648
Hey, Nishikata.

181
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:09,682
Mind if I take a look?

182
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,464
Nope. Go ahead.

183
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,623
How do you like that?

184
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,360
Oh, no.

185
00:10:28,716 --> 00:10:30,367
Did I take it too far?

186
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:34,550
I just drew that based on how I envision you, so...

187
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:36,594
Nishikata.

188
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:47,094
That face is too much, Takagi!

189
00:10:48,435 --> 00:10:50,559
My stomach hurts already!

190
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:53,354
If you're gonna draw me weird,
you should draw that face.

191
00:10:53,743 --> 00:10:57,243
Try again. You can do it. Here.

192
00:10:57,493 --> 00:10:58,529
Okay.

193
00:11:06,842 --> 00:11:09,248
If you can't see me well, I can get closer.

194
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,294
Uh, no, no, that's fine, you're good.

195
00:11:11,973 --> 00:11:12,708
'Kay.

196
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,609
When I get a good look at her, Takagi is kinda...

197
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:24,062
Pre... Pret...

198
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:24,919
Pretty...

199
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:26,999
There. Finished. You see?

200
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,557
So?

201
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,464
Was I really looking sideways that much?

202
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:38,084
Oh! Forgot something.

203
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,438
Now it's done.

204
00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:50,472
Why'd you add red? It's not like I'm blushing!

205
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:51,885
Uh, you have been this whole time.

206
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,925
No, I haven't!

207
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,224
It just looks like that. I swear!

208
00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:56,577
Look closely, I'm not!

209
00:11:58,141 --> 00:11:59,142
<b>"Fortune Telling"</b>

210
00:12:03,743 --> 00:12:04,974
Oh, not bad.

211
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,622
This card means your wish will more or less come true.

212
00:12:07,817 --> 00:12:09,229
Really? Is that so?

213
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,167
You should totally get your love fortune told too, Mina.

214
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,373
She's good at this.

215
00:12:14,398 --> 00:12:15,687
See? Go for it!

216
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,620
Huh? You say you want me to get my fortune told,
but I know you really just want to get yours done.

217
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:22,127
What do you mean? You don't know that!

218
00:12:22,152 --> 00:12:23,250
It's obvious.

219
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,339
No, I just wanted Mina to do it!

220
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:29,309
This really sucks.

221
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:31,007
I just wanted to go home today.

222
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,580
Nishikata.

223
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:34,316
What do you want?

224
00:12:34,663 --> 00:12:37,745
Rock-paper-scissors. You up for a match?

225
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,185
What? Why now?

226
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,660
The loser has to buy the winner juice on the way home.

227
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:42,415
Sound good?

228
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:47,244
Sorry, but I just found out I have to clean
the classroom after school, so go home without me.

229
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,236
No problem, I'll just wait here for you.

230
00:12:51,363 --> 00:12:53,298
But I don't want to make you sit around.

231
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,233
Okay.

232
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:58,757
How about if you win, I have to help you clean up?

233
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,507
Why do you wanna play rock-paper-scissors so bad?

234
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,032
I'm just in the mood for it.

235
00:13:04,356 --> 00:13:06,110
All right, I guess it's okay.

236
00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:08,552
Under one condition!

237
00:13:08,577 --> 00:13:09,481
Which is...?

238
00:13:09,716 --> 00:13:13,546
No psychological attacks like telling
me what you're about to choose, okay?

239
00:13:13,783 --> 00:13:15,154
Sure. Fine with me.

240
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:17,052
That was close.

241
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:21,926
I don't need a repeat of that day I lost to
her four times in a row because of those tricks.

242
00:13:21,993 --> 00:13:23,201
Now let's do it.

243
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,436
Rock! Paper! Scissors!

244
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:29,668
I-I won?

245
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,515
This is my first ever victory over Takagi!

246
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,841
Yes! I finally did it! I bet she's super mad!

247
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:38,754
Well... Guess I'm helping.

248
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,909
She doesn't seem to mind.

249
00:13:50,716 --> 00:13:53,086
Whatever, I don't care. I still won!

250
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,667
I gotta celebrate while I have the chance.

251
00:13:55,856 --> 00:13:56,820
Nishikata?

252
00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:58,457
What is it, Takagi?

253
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,595
Do you believe in fortune telling?

254
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,209
Uh, fortunes? Not really.

255
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,189
Why do you ask?

256
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,515
The girls and I had ours told today.

257
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:06,913
Oh.

258
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:09,114
Is that what that deck of cards was earlier?

259
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,700
They're called tarot cards.

260
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,696
Actually, today my tarot reading was about love.

261
00:14:16,911 --> 00:14:17,871
Oh.

262
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:19,973
Love?

263
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:21,630
Turned out good.

264
00:14:22,566 --> 00:14:24,776
It said I'll do well with my current crush.

265
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:25,951
Your current crush?

266
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,858
Good for you, then.

267
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,270
What about you?

268
00:14:29,396 --> 00:14:30,581
Do you have a crush?

269
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,967
Huh? What was that?

270
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,385
I said, "Do you have a crush?"

271
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,044
Nope! I don't! Definitely not!

272
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:42,659
I see.

273
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,659
Why did she ask me that just now?

274
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:47,351
Could it be?

275
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,888
Does Takagi... like me?

276
00:14:52,782 --> 00:14:53,978
What's wrong?

277
00:14:54,063 --> 00:14:56,305
It's nothing! Don't worry about it, everything's cool!

278
00:15:00,853 --> 00:15:02,767
Why do I feel so nervous?

279
00:15:04,228 --> 00:15:06,078
Unless... I...

280
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:10,691
Do I like Takagi?

281
00:15:12,136 --> 00:15:14,908
No, that's just ridiculous.

282
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:20,294
Oh, by the way, Nishikata.

283
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,308
Yeah? What's up?

284
00:15:21,953 --> 00:15:24,003
The reason I asked if you had a crush

285
00:15:24,603 --> 00:15:27,376
was because I had your tarot reading done, too.

286
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:32,000
So that's why you asked me
that. Makes sense I guess.

287
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,000
Should have known.

288
00:15:37,716 --> 00:15:40,371
Wait. Am I disappointed?

289
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:42,283
Yeah. And guess what?

290
00:15:42,336 --> 00:15:44,230
You'll do well with your crush, too.

291
00:15:46,835 --> 00:15:49,413
That'd be great. If you had a crush.

292
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:52,550
You're blushing.

293
00:15:52,926 --> 00:15:55,055
That's because I'm hard at work cleaning.

294
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,500
Just change the subject.

295
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:58,930
So what other readings did you have done?

296
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,845
I asked what you'd pick if we
played rock-paper-scissors.

297
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,815
Huh? As in the match I won earlier?

298
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,355
Mm-hmm.

299
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:09,819
Clearly that didn't work out.

300
00:16:09,952 --> 00:16:13,642
It's just a fortune, not
destiny. I feel stupid for worrying.

301
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:16,612
Maybe if you didn't believe in
something as silly as fortune telling,

302
00:16:16,637 --> 00:16:19,070
you wouldn't be stuck here, doing half my work!

303
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:20,457
It came true, though.

304
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,421
Huh? What do you mean? I won that match, didn't I?

305
00:16:23,446 --> 00:16:25,408
Yup. You sure did.

306
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:31,656
Come on.

307
00:16:31,796 --> 00:16:33,662
Let's get back to cleaning this place up.

308
00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:34,288
Yeah.

309
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:36,042
Wait, what?

310
00:16:42,236 --> 00:16:43,188
"Critical."

311
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,383
Today's the day.

312
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,957
I'm gonna beat Takagi.

313
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,983
Count on it!

314
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:55,167
Oh. Hey, Nishikata. Good morning.

315
00:16:55,586 --> 00:16:57,425
Back atcha. Morning.

316
00:16:58,343 --> 00:17:00,344
Somebody's in a good mood today.

317
00:17:00,636 --> 00:17:02,571
Really? You think so?

318
00:17:03,913 --> 00:17:05,456
I'm in a great mood.

319
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:11,028
You have no idea what's coming your way.

320
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:13,973
It just so happens that I'm invincible today.

321
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:16,304
Because according to my horoscope this morning,

322
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,950
I am number...!

323
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:20,895
Is it your horoscope? Cancer was number one today.

324
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,107
Huh?!

325
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:24,322
Hold on a second, how do you know I'm a cancer?

326
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,776
I mean, I said happy birthday to you this year, so...

327
00:17:27,863 --> 00:17:30,864
Oh. I forgot. I guess that makes sense.

328
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,836
What, does she read everyone's horoscope every day?

329
00:17:34,363 --> 00:17:35,505
She's crafty.

330
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,709
But she underestimates me.

331
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:41,095
I bet she doesn't know that in today's
blood-type fortune, I'm also...!

332
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,703
Also, blood type O's number one, too.

333
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,736
Huh?!

334
00:17:44,906 --> 00:17:46,936
Okay, how do you know that I'm blood type O?

335
00:17:46,961 --> 00:17:48,406
I had a feeling that you were.

336
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:49,579
Just a guess.

337
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:53,384
She's just too good.

338
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:55,479
I was the one underestimating her.

339
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:57,713
You just can't mess with this girl.

340
00:17:58,282 --> 00:17:59,687
But just you wait.

341
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:01,765
Today I'm invinc...!

342
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,790
Feeling invincible today, aren't you?

343
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,290
Because of what you heard about both of your fortunes?

344
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,784
Ah.

345
00:18:10,532 --> 00:18:13,015
Are you freaking' kidding me?

346
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,305
Well then. I hope something good happens.

347
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,749
Yeah, that'd be cool.

348
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,260
I don't care if you basically read my mind!

349
00:18:20,376 --> 00:18:23,166
I'm lucky as can be today! I'll get you!

350
00:18:31,924 --> 00:18:33,744
Teased fifty times.

351
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:36,387
Which means I have to do a hundred and fifty push-ups.

352
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,691
Why? This sucks!

353
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:42,650
Was it stupid of me to get excited just
because I'm supposed to have good fortune?

354
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:43,437
Ugh...

355
00:18:44,345 --> 00:18:45,189
What's wrong?

356
00:18:45,214 --> 00:18:47,262
Are you upset because nothing special happened?

357
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:48,942
It's just a silly fortune.

358
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,832
You seemed to believe that tarot
reading you had the other day!

359
00:18:52,725 --> 00:18:56,455
Man, I've spent all day trying to
think of a plan to beat Takagi,

360
00:18:56,586 --> 00:18:58,504
but I couldn't come up with anything worthwhile.

361
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,838
Maybe I should just call it quits for now.

362
00:19:00,946 --> 00:19:05,721
Either my fortune's wrong, or my luck is
that I only got teased fifty times today.

363
00:19:06,106 --> 00:19:07,147
Hey, Nishikata.

364
00:19:07,316 --> 00:19:08,938
Let's walk home together.

365
00:19:09,376 --> 00:19:10,986
Oh. Yeah, sure, why not?

366
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:13,966
No, I can't let it end like this!

367
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:19,432
By the way, what exactly did
your fortune say this morning?

368
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,000
Say what? You mean...

369
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:23,105
That short description they write with your rank?

370
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:23,747
Mm-hmm.

371
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:25,007
Uh, let's see.

372
00:19:25,116 --> 00:19:26,277
Something like...

373
00:19:26,683 --> 00:19:28,303
Cancer is in first place.

374
00:19:28,362 --> 00:19:30,452
You'll land a critical hit! Get 'em!

375
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,799
That's right! A critical hit!

376
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:36,816
Which means I can turn the tables with a single blow!

377
00:19:36,863 --> 00:19:38,472
It all makes sense now!

378
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,830
No matter how many times she teases me today,
if I can get back at her just once, I win!

379
00:19:42,855 --> 00:19:44,459
Never give up hope!

380
00:19:44,636 --> 00:19:46,836
So? "Something like" what?

381
00:19:46,993 --> 00:19:50,053
Uh... I can't seem to remember what it was.

382
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,809
Hey, Nishikata!

383
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,020
That game Fierce Soccer's on sale today!

384
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,181
We're playing' at his house. You in?

385
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:10,779
Fierce Soccer, huh?

386
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,666
I did want to play that.

387
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,950
But I can't go home without scoring my critical hit!

388
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:23,166
Then again, I haven't exactly
come up with any sort of plan yet.

389
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,630
No, I should still be able to do it.

390
00:20:25,723 --> 00:20:28,697
I'm the luckiest man on
earth today! I can do anything!

391
00:20:29,086 --> 00:20:30,212
You regret it?

392
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,129
Turning 'em down?

393
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,982
Oh, that. Nah.

394
00:20:35,393 --> 00:20:37,367
I wanted to walk home with you, anyway.

395
00:20:39,597 --> 00:20:42,533
Hmm. There's gotta be something.

396
00:20:44,749 --> 00:20:45,556
Hold on!

397
00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:47,993
I didn't just say something super awkward, did I?

398
00:20:55,614 --> 00:20:59,580
Uh... I remembered my fortune which said
I'd land a critical hit today, so...

399
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:02,506
I thought today was gonna be my best
chance to beat you at something!

400
00:21:02,543 --> 00:21:04,545
So what I just said wasn't what it sounded like!

401
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:10,289
This is the worst!

402
00:21:10,473 --> 00:21:12,144
I didn't land a critical hit!

403
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:14,221
I scored on my own goal!

404
00:21:16,907 --> 00:21:18,657
So uh... Do me a solid.

405
00:21:18,683 --> 00:21:20,417
Could'ya pretend you didn't hear that?

406
00:21:22,723 --> 00:21:24,227
I guess I can do that.

407
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:27,320
I'll pretend I heard nothing.

408
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:29,698
If you say it one more time.

409
00:21:31,096 --> 00:21:33,026
I am not gonna say it again!

410
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,030
Forget you, I'm going this way!

411
00:21:35,055 --> 00:21:36,435
I'll see you around!

412
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:53,957
A critical hit.

413
00:21:56,426 --> 00:21:57,980
How terrifying.
