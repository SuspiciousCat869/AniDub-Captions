00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:33,855
<b>"Calligraphy"</b>

2
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:38,270
All right.

3
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,200
Now, we're practicing calligraphy,
so write down your favorite thing.

4
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,702
Due by the end of the day.

5
00:01:44,346 --> 00:01:46,256
Well, I know what I'm writing.

6
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,526
Grilled meat.

7
00:01:47,912 --> 00:01:49,118
My favorite.

8
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,126
Having trouble deciding?

9
00:01:54,465 --> 00:01:55,315
Sorta.

10
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:57,079
Did you figure out what you're gonna write?

11
00:01:57,223 --> 00:01:59,362
Hmmm... Not just yet.

12
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:01,619
I know.

13
00:02:01,644 --> 00:02:04,684
How about we both write down
something that we want from each other?

14
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,000
What we want from each other?

15
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,866
Uh-huh.

16
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:11,215
Hmm...

17
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,816
Okay.

18
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,063
What I want from Takagi?

19
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,122
Hmm...

20
00:02:23,683 --> 00:02:24,404
Duh!

21
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,330
For her to stop teasing me!

22
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,290
This'll be a good way to tell her off!

23
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,552
Wait.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,686
Now that I think about it, that might actually backfire.

25
00:02:35,283 --> 00:02:37,956
She'd probably call me a wuss and make fun of me more.

26
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:42,103
I need to find a way to make her
sorry without provoking her further.

27
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:46,263
This is harder than it should be.

28
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,091
You done? Because I am.

29
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:54,595
Cool.

30
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,628
Let's show each other.

31
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,082
Howdya like this?

32
00:03:03,203 --> 00:03:04,068
"Restraint"?

33
00:03:05,473 --> 00:03:07,352
Uh, yeah.

34
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,391
With what?

35
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:11,006
I can't really help if you don't specify.

36
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,360
Uh... Well, it's, uh, a few different things.

37
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:17,360
She clearly doesn't get it.

38
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:21,406
But then again, at this point if she
did get it, she'd probably get upset.

39
00:03:21,816 --> 00:03:23,049
This is tricky.

40
00:03:26,603 --> 00:03:28,196
So what about you?

41
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:29,789
What do you mean by "status quo"?

42
00:03:31,402 --> 00:03:32,652
Oh, you don't get it?

43
00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:38,455
Well, it means you're easy to tease,
and I want you to stay that way, 'Kay?

44
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,910
Red alert! She's going on the offensive!

45
00:03:40,935 --> 00:03:42,137
It's an ambush!

46
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:44,774
If that's how she wants this to go, fine.

47
00:03:44,827 --> 00:03:46,210
Two can play at that game.

48
00:03:46,235 --> 00:03:47,693
I'm ready for it now.

49
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,516
Are you okay with a do-over?

50
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:52,869
Yeah, sure.

51
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:58,329
Get set to get wrecked, Takagi!

52
00:03:58,356 --> 00:04:00,558
I'm about to fight fire with fire!

53
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,370
So, did you finish?

54
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:04,694
Almost.

55
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,580
This should make Takagi realize
that she isn't exactly kind to me.

56
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:16,033
Can't misinterpret this!

57
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,236
Forget what I said before, now I want to upset you!

58
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,051
Huh... What should I write?

59
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,395
Ho-ho what's this?

60
00:04:24,435 --> 00:04:26,110
Having trouble coming up with something?

61
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:30,666
Perhaps if you were a bit kinder, it'd be easy
to come up with a nice, wholesome request from me.

62
00:04:30,746 --> 00:04:33,095
Oh. I wanted to tell you earlier,

63
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:34,965
you have really nice handwriting.

64
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:36,925
It has an interesting flare.

65
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:38,476
Have you been taught calligraphy?

66
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:40,806
Uh, no, not really.

67
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,792
Hmm?

68
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:44,700
Well, either way,

69
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:46,571
I like it a lot.

70
00:04:59,250 --> 00:04:59,767
Here.

71
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,535
Uh...

72
00:05:01,883 --> 00:05:02,742
Thanks.

73
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:05,607
That's weird.

74
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:07,973
She's being so nice all of a sudden.

75
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:09,513
What's going on?

76
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,341
Could it be?

77
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,712
Is Takagi actually nice,

78
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:17,020
and I just haven't noticed it until now?

79
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:19,157
No way.

80
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:20,885
I'd have picked up on that.

81
00:05:24,113 --> 00:05:26,763
Nishikata, stay still for a second.

82
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:27,516
Huh?!

83
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:30,502
Huh?

84
00:05:34,403 --> 00:05:35,019
Got it.

85
00:05:35,217 --> 00:05:36,818
Something was on your face.

86
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:39,175
Okay!

87
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:41,335
I think I have something to write now.

88
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:53,839
Do you like my beautiful artwork?

89
00:05:53,864 --> 00:05:55,257
You're a weird guy, you know that?

90
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,495
What?

91
00:05:59,316 --> 00:05:59,977
Okay.

92
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:01,106
I'm done.

93
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,750
How about you show me yours first?

94
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,050
Uh... Why not at the same time?

95
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,736
Just show me already.

96
00:06:10,396 --> 00:06:11,390
Ahhh...

97
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,474
I was a little more obvious this time, at least.

98
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,265
You really do have interesting handwriting.

99
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,015
That's all you have to say? Come on.

100
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,697
I'm trying to spell it out for you. Stop teasing me.

101
00:06:23,722 --> 00:06:25,154
What? I can't!

102
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:27,393
You didn't even give it some thought.

103
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,159
All right, I'm sorry.

104
00:06:30,253 --> 00:06:31,759
I'll hold back from now on.

105
00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:32,856
Thank you.

106
00:06:32,943 --> 00:06:34,067
So what's yours say?

107
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:35,593
Curious?

108
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:37,826
Then let's see.

109
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,066
Here.

110
00:06:57,473 --> 00:06:59,501
When she touched my face.

111
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:02,736
Didn't you just say that you'd hold back from now on?

112
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,604
Yeah, but I said that after I already set this up.

113
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,041
<b>"Seasonal Change of Clothing"</b>

114
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,225
So hot.

115
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,277
Yeah, I guess so.

116
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:40,525
We should start wearing our short-sleeve uniform soon.

117
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,522
Yeah. I guess so.

118
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,116
Let's just tell Sanae that we're gonna
start wearing them tomorrow, sound good?

119
00:07:48,243 --> 00:07:50,256
Yeah, I guess so.

120
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:51,995
You guess what?

121
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,719
Huh?

122
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:56,514
Hey.

123
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,774
Long sleeves?

124
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:05,692
Aren't you hot?

125
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:12,636
What?

126
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,750
We said that we'd all change
our uniforms at the same time!

127
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:17,742
Come on!

128
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:19,622
Wait, we did?

129
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,034
Yes, we did!

130
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:22,151
You forgot?

131
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:24,135
Hmm?

132
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,670
Yeah.

<b>"The next day"</b>

Ahhhh! It's a lot cooler wearing short sleeves, isn't it?

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,187
Yeah, I guess so.

136
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:41,920
Hey.

137
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,620
You guess what?

Hey, Sanae. Good mor... ning.

139
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:58,659
I thought you said we were all
gonna change our uniforms together?

140
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:02,545
Uhh...

141
00:09:02,944 --> 00:09:04,255
Uh...

142
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:06,910
I guess I forgot to tell you.

00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:13,059
I wanna ask you to let me go,
but I know I deserve this, so...

"English Translation."

145

Junko says,

146
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,935
"That's right. Walk down this street
to the post office and turn left there."

147
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:28,955
You will see the station.

148
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:31,763
It takes five minutes from here.

149
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:35,148
Somehow I have to get back at Takagi today.

150
00:09:36,582 --> 00:09:39,602
But the ever-present question is: How?

151
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:44,738
I haven't made a jack-in-the-box in a while.

152
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,290
No, I don't have enough materials.

153
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,868
At this point, I wouldn't finish in time, anyway.

154
00:09:50,194 --> 00:09:51,274
Uhh.

155
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,325
Let's see, who should I put on the spot?

156
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,870
Nishikata.

157
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:55,549
Huh?

158
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,540
Uhh.

159
00:09:56,565 --> 00:09:57,360
Yes, sir!

160
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:01,143
Don't "Huh? Yes, sir!" me. Hurry up.

161
00:10:05,135 --> 00:10:06,805
Don't worry, it's 16.

162
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,432
Huh?

163
00:10:08,558 --> 00:10:10,678
Sixteen!

164
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:15,410
You don't even know what class you're in, kid?

165
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:17,015
It's English, not Math!

166
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,534
I told you to read aloud!

167
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,450
Uh... I'm sorry, sir.

168
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,944
Forget it. Sit down.

169
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,540
I told you we were on line 16.

170
00:10:26,565 --> 00:10:28,273
Way to drop the ball there.

171
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:31,586
Yeah, right, you were intentionally
vague, so I'd mess it up.

172
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,256
Really.

173
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:34,522
I didn't think you'd actually mess that up.

174
00:10:34,753 --> 00:10:35,713
Called it.

175
00:10:37,234 --> 00:10:38,309
What's wrong?

176
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:40,122
Are you preoccupied with something?

177
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,177
You could say that.

178
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,841
Mind if I ask what it is?

179
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,062
Ehh.

180
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:50,251
It's really not worth mentioning.

181
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,399
Huuuuh...

182
00:10:52,797 --> 00:10:53,672
Then...

183
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,041
Were you thinking about something naughty?

184
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:01,155
Wha...?!

185
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:03,013
No way! Of course not!

186
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:03,913
Really?

187
00:11:03,938 --> 00:11:04,725
I would never!

188
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,925
Not in a million years!

189
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,843
What kinda guy do ya' think I am?!

190
00:11:08,057 --> 00:11:09,585
I know. I know.

191
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:14,752
You were just trying to think of new way to
get back at me for all the teasing I do, right?

192
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,040
Nuh-uh.

193
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:18,473
No idea what you mean.

194
00:11:18,836 --> 00:11:20,447
I know I'm right.

195
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:22,559
You were looking at me earlier, so...

196
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,681
...it wasn't that hard to figure out.

197
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:27,436
If you already knew, then why'd you ask?

198
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,710
'Cus it's fun to see how you react when I mess with you.

199
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,370
So what?

200
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,197
Did you come up with a good idea?

201
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,086
Hmph!

202
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,250
Yup, sure did.

203
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,790
You see, I came up with the perfect plan.

204
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,410
Oh and this time it's absolutely foolproof.

205
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,502
So...

206
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,632
Hmm...

207
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,713
I'll believe it when I see it.

208
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:50,377
She's not worried at all.

209
00:11:50,402 --> 00:11:53,456
It's like she can read my mind,
so she knows I don't have a plan!

210
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,550
Spill it.

211
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,411
What's this plan of yours?

212
00:11:57,045 --> 00:11:58,475
What idiot would tell you that?

213
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,083
Oh fine, how about just a hint?

214
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:01,349
I'm not telling you!

215
00:12:01,374 --> 00:12:02,596
Just pay attention.

216
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,305
Wait, today's the eighteenth.

217
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,062
The teachers always call on the kid
whose student number matches the date.

218
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:12,084
And today that's Takagi!

219
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,816
If I can get her attention away from class, she might get
in trouble for not knowing where we are in the textbook!

220
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,550
Hey, Takagi?

221
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,700
D'you eat breakfast today?

222
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:21,546
Whadja have?

223
00:12:22,227 --> 00:12:24,307
Yeah, mountain yam over rice.

224
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,700
Why ask?

225
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,362
Ehh.

226
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:28,195
Just curious.

227
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,807
So you like mountain yams?

228
00:12:33,276 --> 00:12:34,635
Yeah, I like 'em.

229
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,454
I usually have energy all day
when I eat them in the morning.

230
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:38,687
Huh.

231
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,331
Yeah, I kinda getcha.

232
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,062
What'd you eat?

233
00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:43,206
Me?

234
00:12:43,385 --> 00:12:44,637
Uh, I had...

235
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,910
Bet you can't guess.

236
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:49,564
Hmm, I wonder.

237
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,442
Rice?

238
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,874
Rice? Why's that?

239
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:56,200
Well, I didn't peg you as a toast kinda guy.

240
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,160
Am I wrong?

241
00:12:57,227 --> 00:12:59,307
No. You're right, I had rice.

242
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,390
It's working!

243
00:13:00,415 --> 00:13:02,489
Just keep her attention off of the lesson!

244
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:05,295
So uhh... you on team rice?

245
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,432
I want someone to read the next page aloud.

246
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,730
Today's the eighteenth, so how about Takagi.

247
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:15,772
Here we go! Heh heh heh.

248
00:13:17,371 --> 00:13:19,265
You don't know where we are, do you?

249
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,075
Do you?

250
00:13:21,977 --> 00:13:24,427
"I will not do such a thing."

251
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,175
Thank you. Very nice.

252
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,388
What?

253
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,022
Hmph.

254
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,080
Nice try.

255
00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:35,735
Wh-What are you talking about?

256
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,323
Man, she's good!

257
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:40,045
I can never seem to get her!

258
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,900
Gotta come up with another plan.

259
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:45,316
Maybe I can take it back to basics
and hit her with the old jack-in-the-box?

260
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:48,684
No, I don't have the materials!

261
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:50,020
Been over this!

262
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:52,385
Okay.

263
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,700
What is it this time?

264
00:13:53,761 --> 00:13:55,750
Uh? It's, uhh...

265
00:13:55,864 --> 00:13:57,746
Nothing, forget it.

266
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,031
By any chance, were you thinking about me again?

267
00:14:03,372 --> 00:14:04,885
No, not really.

268
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,688
Not in so many words.

269
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,910
Plus, why would I think about you?

270
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,367
That'd be weird, wouldn't it?

271
00:14:10,468 --> 00:14:12,765
Oooh, then you were thinking something naughty.

272
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,289
No! I swear!

273
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,678
I know.

274
00:14:20,097 --> 00:14:22,352
I'm always thinking about you, though.

275
00:14:26,357 --> 00:14:27,857
Hey, you're blushing!

276
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:30,336
No I'm not.

277
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:32,025
And gimme a break.

278
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:35,785
You're just always thinking about
different ways to tease me, aren't you?

279
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,841
Eh...

280
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,930
Why did she take so long to answer?

281
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:52,874
Today's June eighteenth.

282
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,790
If I add the month and date together, it's 24.

283
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,925
Number 24!

284
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,373
Nishikata!

285
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:03,599
<b>"Pool"</b>

286
00:15:13,004 --> 00:15:16,984
It's the first day we get to go in
the pool, but all I can do is watch.

287
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:20,106
Why'd I have to hurt my hand?

288
00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:26,247
It's just not fair.

289
00:15:26,349 --> 00:15:28,148
They're all having fun without me.

290
00:15:28,368 --> 00:15:29,403
Right?

291
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:33,497
And of course this happens on
the first day that they let us swim.

292
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,519
It sucks!

293
00:15:34,544 --> 00:15:36,925
So you're sitting out too, I take it?

294
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,884
Mm-hmm.

295
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:41,155
For you it's because of your hand, yeah?

296
00:15:41,258 --> 00:15:42,355
How'd you hurt it?

297
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,566
Yeah.

298
00:15:46,185 --> 00:15:49,252
Well, you know, things happen.

299
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:52,975
I bet you tried to pet a cat, but then it bit you.

300
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,120
Huh?! Wait, how did you know that?

301
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,160
I made an effort not to tell anyone!

302
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,975
I'm actually right?

303
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,771
I just took a shot in the dark!

304
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,616
You are something else!

305
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,540
So what's your excuse?

306
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,941
Why are you just watching everyone swim... today?

307
00:16:16,398 --> 00:16:18,088
That reminds me.

308
00:16:18,883 --> 00:16:22,555
Any girl who sits out during
swimming is usually on her period.

309
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:26,540
According to the textbook, it
causes abdominal pain and discomfort.

310
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:29,598
So says Takao, the King of Health Class.

311
00:16:30,418 --> 00:16:33,103
Oh, uh, it's nothing, forget it.

312
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,129
I shouldn't ask.

313
00:16:35,154 --> 00:16:37,822
It's not really any of my business anyway.

314
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:41,341
You wanted to ask why I'm not swimming today, didn't you?

315
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:42,784
Of course she heard me.

316
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:49,878
Oh. Hey. How about because I figured out your reason
is your hand, you take a shot at guessing my reason?

317
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,410
You're not feeling good?

318
00:16:55,435 --> 00:16:57,783
You have to be more specific than that.

319
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,482
No. Forget it.

320
00:17:00,507 --> 00:17:02,470
I wasn't actually gonna ask you.

321
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,580
Oh?

322
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,514
Then are you admitting defeat?

323
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,450
All right, fine.

324
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,120
I might as well take a guess.

325
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,580
Only one, though.

326
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:15,198
Well, not that you'd get it with more tries.

327
00:17:15,444 --> 00:17:17,194
She's got me cornered now.

328
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:20,289
Is she this confident because
she thinks I can't say "period"?

329
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,953
Because if that's it, I'll show her!

330
00:17:21,978 --> 00:17:23,320
I'll say it ten times!

331
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,885
But wait, this is Takagi we're talking about.

332
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,734
It could be a trap!

333
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:32,191
Even if I gathered my courage and answered, "Period"!

334
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,310
I know what'll happen!

335
00:17:34,664 --> 00:17:36,820
No, and that's very rude of you!

336
00:17:38,983 --> 00:17:40,970
So that's out of the question.

337
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:44,925
But knowing her, she probably already
has an idea of what's going through my head.

338
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,325
I'm hesitating, that's enough for her to figure it out.

339
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,335
But if I don't answer at all,

340
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:52,154
well, I think I know how that'll go, too.

341
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,509
You don't even know the reason why a girl
is sitting out when she could be swimming?

342
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:00,809
Ha! That means I win, then.

343
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,575
Is this a trap or not?

344
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,055
Is she making it seem genuine so I'll fall into a trap?

345
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,635
Or is she making it seem like a
trap, so I'll worry and mess up?

346
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,964
Agh. I'm just going around in circles here!

347
00:18:11,946 --> 00:18:12,986
This sucks.

348
00:18:13,088 --> 00:18:14,716
What was with that face before?

349
00:18:14,741 --> 00:18:16,751
And was she gripping her stomach or what?

350
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,395
Okay, what else could it be?

351
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,803
Maybe an injury?

352
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,326
I don't know; it doesn't seem like it.

353
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,790
It doesn't really look like she's
feeling too sick to be exercising either.

354
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:32,955
Then that leaves.

355
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:34,443
What's left?

356
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:35,777
No.

357
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:43,396
They don't know how good they have it.

358
00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:46,547
They get to goof around and cool off in the pool.

359
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,459
Meanwhile I'm here in the heat using
all my brain power to battle Takagi.

360
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,950
Come on, Nishikata, we don't have all day.

361
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,193
You're not just checking out all
the girls in their swimsuits, are you?

362
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,268
What? Of course I'm not!

363
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:00,866
Are you sure about that?

364
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,750
Because you know what I heard?

365
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,250
Boys are usually looking at girls' chests.

366
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,348
Whatever, then I'm the exception!

367
00:19:10,355 --> 00:19:12,185
I could never say this out loud.

368
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,339
But Takagi doesn't have a very big chest.

369
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:19,120
I heard that small-chested girls are...

370
00:19:19,244 --> 00:19:20,414
...sensitive about it.

371
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,314
So you probs shouldn't bring it up.

372
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,660
So says Kimura, the King of Early Lunch.

373
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,830
Could it be that she's not swimming because
she has some sort of complex about her body?

374
00:19:29,855 --> 00:19:31,528
Like, she's self-conscious?

375
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,200
I had a feeling you wouldn't figure it out.

376
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,232
That means I win today, too.

377
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,832
Oh, Takagi.

378
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:39,420
I do know why.

379
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,820
It's obvious that you're just
self-conscious about your chest!

380
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,021
Ugh! Yeah, right!

381
00:19:47,046 --> 00:19:48,340
Like I could ever say that!

382
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:50,639
It's beyond rude! It's super rude!

383
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,506
The only answer I have left is that she's on her period!

384
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,950
But that's plenty rude, too.

385
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,215
What do I do?

386
00:19:57,557 --> 00:19:59,267
You're still thinking it over?

387
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:01,028
We have to go back inside soon.

388
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:01,616
No!

389
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:05,190
They even say in the textbook that it's
nothing to be embarrassed about! It'll be fine!

390
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,330
You got this.

391
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,925
Just say it with your head held high!

392
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,311
It's now or never!

393
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:12,454
The reason you're sitting out in swim class is...

394
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:17,257
...you're on your period.

395
00:20:21,081 --> 00:20:22,559
Incorrect.

396
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:26,259
And that's pretty rude to say to a girl.

397
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:30,229
Uh! I just thought that since it was
mentioned in our health textbook, it might...

398
00:20:32,938 --> 00:20:35,630
Man Nishikata, your face is bright red!

399
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:41,290
Then is it actually because she's
self-conscious about her chest?

400
00:20:41,315 --> 00:20:42,540
That's all I got!

401
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,193
Ahhh... Too funny.

402
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,111
Upsy-daisy.

403
00:20:56,527 --> 00:20:57,907
And for the record.

404
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,807
Being too self-conscious about my chest...

405
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,700
...is also incorrect.

406
00:21:04,768 --> 00:21:05,548
Wha...?!

407
00:21:06,446 --> 00:21:07,578
Excuse me!

408
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,910
I changed my mind, is it okay if I swim?

409
00:21:11,012 --> 00:21:12,066
That's fine!

410
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,080
Uh... I don't get it.

411
00:21:15,138 --> 00:21:16,835
Then why was she sitting out?

412
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:18,124
Okay.

413
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:20,265
Now that I've gotten my fill of funny faces.

414
00:21:20,315 --> 00:21:21,672
It's time for a quick swim.

415
00:21:22,187 --> 00:21:26,174
Oh, don't tell me you were sitting out that
whole time just so you could tease me more!

416
00:21:33,132 --> 00:21:35,302
Hey. When your hand heals...

417
00:21:38,155 --> 00:21:39,822
...then we can swim together.

418
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,736
It's cold!

419
00:21:54,922 --> 00:21:56,212
I won't fall for it.

420
00:21:56,345 --> 00:21:57,725
When we do swim together,

421
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,911
I'd bet anything she's gonna mess with me again.

422
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:03,791
After all, that's the kind of person she is.
