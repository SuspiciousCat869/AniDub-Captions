1
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:30,262
The current Kira is foolish and overconfident,

2
00:01:30,286 --> 00:01:33,222
not to mention unusually cooperative with the task force.

3
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:36,068
In fact, I suspect he's working hand in hand with them.

4
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:36,790
You think so?

5
00:01:36,815 --> 00:01:38,707
That would make the second L and Kira...

6
00:01:39,428 --> 00:01:40,862
one in the same person.

7
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,919
To the members of the Japanese task force,

8
00:01:44,339 --> 00:01:48,545
was there ever a point in the investigation
where the Second L was suspected to be Kira,

9
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,509
even if the suspicions were later dropped?

10
00:01:50,534 --> 00:01:53,509
Near. I have to kill him.

11
00:01:54,673 --> 00:01:55,773
This is really bad.

12
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:57,748
Turn on the TV. It's Demegawa!

13
00:01:57,773 --> 00:01:59,441
This is Demegawa live!

14
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:03,461
My comrades and I have finally pinpointed
the hideout of the evil organization

15
00:02:03,486 --> 00:02:05,732
bent on trying to catch our beloved god Kira.

16
00:02:05,865 --> 00:02:08,262
We now have the building completely surrounded!

17
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,623
Hello, Kira supporters.

18
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,892
I urge you, do not rush the building all at once.

19
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:37,772
The traitors may attempt to
blend in with the crowd to escape.

20
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,968
I am Kira's loyal servant and spokesman.

21
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:43,030
You must listen to me!

22
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,769
Find them, pull them from the building,
and bring them in front of the cameras.

23
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:50,742
They'll be a sacrifice for Kira!

24
00:02:57,328 --> 00:02:59,709
You can't hide from me. I'll find you.

25
00:03:01,612 --> 00:03:04,838
Near. You've got no choice. You'd better evacuate.

26
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:07,743
You've got some nerve to say that, being Kira.

27
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:10,273
What? Are you still going on about that nonsense?

28
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:11,795
Think about it.

29
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:13,708
With all the anti-Kira groups around,

30
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:17,404
why is it we're being targeted, and
right after I start suspecting you?

31
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:19,668
Pretty convenient, if you ask me.

32
00:03:20,273 --> 00:03:22,273
Near, with all due respect, you're wrong.

33
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:23,838
You're jumping to conclusions.

34
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:27,190
Members of the task force, please listen to me.

35
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,914
Kira is likely amongst you.

36
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:31,114
Even as we speak, he is in that room.

37
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:33,924
I'm simply asking you to think about this carefully.

38
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,667
Light is Kira.

39
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,398
This is all sounding way too familiar.

40
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:43,376
The original L also thought that Light had to be Kira.

41
00:03:51,572 --> 00:03:54,823
The first wave of 20 people
will break the door and get inside.

42
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:56,686
Second wave, stand by!

43
00:03:57,995 --> 00:03:59,152
Wait!

44
00:03:59,177 --> 00:04:00,377
We're the first wave!

45
00:04:00,402 --> 00:04:02,282
What? Like hell. We're going first!

46
00:04:05,338 --> 00:04:07,618
Near, we have to evacuate immediately.

47
00:04:08,262 --> 00:04:10,797
Really, what pathetic people.

48
00:04:11,162 --> 00:04:15,218
I'm not surprised that there are ordinary
people who support what Kira's trying to do.

49
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,857
I'm talking about honest citizens who believe
in their hearts that, by punishing evildoers,

50
00:04:19,883 --> 00:04:22,883
Kira will actually make this world a better place to live.

51
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:26,482
But, as for this crowd outside,
they're a completely different breed.

52
00:04:26,522 --> 00:04:28,509
They are truly despicable and stupid.

53
00:04:28,638 --> 00:04:30,636
This is just a diversion for them.

54
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:31,960
They're all selfish.

55
00:04:33,225 --> 00:04:36,412
I... I know that, but it still
leaves us with the immediate problem.

56
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:39,644
We'll use L's legacy and the
anti-Kira protesters we hired.

57
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,367
Yes, but we only have one shot with that plan.

58
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:47,004
I'm aware of that, but I can't
imagine a better time to do it.

59
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:49,133
Besides, it should be interesting.

60
00:05:06,112 --> 00:05:06,870
What?

61
00:05:06,895 --> 00:05:11,101
It's... It's money!

62
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:19,327
Money?

63
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:21,063
There's so much!

64
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:22,887
What?

65
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:24,975
That's a lot.

66
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,133
Amazing!

67
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:28,654
Man, I wish I were over there right now.

68
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,534
Matsuda.

69
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:30,354
Heh.

70
00:05:30,695 --> 00:05:32,565
Humans are so interesting.

71
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:37,031
Of course, you can use money to get
apples, so I can kind of understand.

72
00:05:37,056 --> 00:05:38,987
I got these first, you bastard!

73
00:05:39,032 --> 00:05:40,118
Out of the way!

74
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:40,957
Dammit!

75
00:05:40,982 --> 00:05:43,505
He's planning to use all this
chaos to escape into the crowd.

76
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:46,784
Even so, he can't escape from Demegawa's cameras.

77
00:05:50,323 --> 00:05:51,595
Over there, pilot!

78
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,491
Go to the floor where all the money's coming from!

79
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:57,392
Geez! What are you doing, Demegawa?

80
00:05:57,431 --> 00:06:00,036
Don't you know that you can't
buy love and peace with money?

81
00:06:02,076 --> 00:06:05,599
A literal downpour of money is
causing mayhem in lower Manhattan.

82
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:07,816
The police have arrived.

83
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:08,937
Police?

84
00:06:08,962 --> 00:06:12,369
They're a welcome sight in the midst of
what can only be called a full scale riot.

85
00:06:12,394 --> 00:06:13,306
This is bad.

86
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:14,386
At this rate...

87
00:06:18,494 --> 00:06:19,417
Let's go.

88
00:06:20,105 --> 00:06:21,638
This is our window of opportunity.

89
00:06:21,663 --> 00:06:23,114
We can leave via the front exit.

90
00:06:23,552 --> 00:06:26,978
It makes sense that the police would
have to mobilize for a riot like this.

91
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,254
Damn! Near was prepared for this situation.

92
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,375
He's planning to come out along with the rest of them,

93
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,908
and if I tell Aizawa and the
others to keep an eye on the police,

94
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:37,263
it will only make me look that much more suspicious.

95
00:06:37,717 --> 00:06:39,464
The police are coming out of the building.

96
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:40,877
They've secured the area.

97
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:44,434
Where is he?

98
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:46,536
He's got to be in there somewhere!

99
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:48,369
Where?

100
00:06:57,979 --> 00:06:58,960
Dammit.

101
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,464
How much money do you think was there?

102
00:07:25,489 --> 00:07:26,422
Bet it was a lot.

103
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,124
Matsuda! Knock it off.

104
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:30,385
It bet it was around $10 million or something.

105
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:32,490
Ooh. What's that in apples?

106
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:41,161
Near.

107
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:42,975
Already?

108
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,076
This is Near.

109
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:51,695
We've re-established a secure connection,

110
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,046
so I thought I should give you a call to let you know.

111
00:07:54,316 --> 00:07:56,377
You're safe. That's a relief.

112
00:07:56,705 --> 00:07:58,614
To all of you on the task force,

113
00:07:58,724 --> 00:08:03,003
I'm sure that by now some of you are
starting to suspect that Kira may be one of you.

114
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:06,505
Given the timing of today's attack on our headquarters,

115
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,083
I don't think anyone could blame you for having doubts.

116
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,460
If you don't suspect the second L of being Kira by now,

117
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:14,017
you're in the wrong line of work.

118
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:18,394
The number I gave you the day before has been reconnected.

119
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,548
Please feel free to call any time you like.

120
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:24,327
Well then, I'll be waiting for your call.

121
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,481
Those were some strong words.

122
00:08:31,506 --> 00:08:33,260
This guy's pretty sure of himself.

123
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:37,205
I've been thinking,

124
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:39,724
and if any of you want to cooperate with Near,

125
00:08:39,761 --> 00:08:40,800
please go ahead.

126
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:45,054
I'm not particularly satisfied
with the way things are going either.

127
00:08:45,085 --> 00:08:47,851
Ideally, we should cooperate with the SPK.

128
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,646
Maybe this will clear the air a little.

129
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:53,205
Still, it kinda feels like Near's against us, doesn't it?

130
00:09:17,027 --> 00:09:19,541
When I think about Deputy Director Yagami

131
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:22,893
I don't want to suspect Light even a little bit, but...

132
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,033
Dad?

133
00:09:26,342 --> 00:09:27,406
Welcome back.

134
00:09:27,431 --> 00:09:29,327
I didn't know you were gonna be home tonight.

135
00:09:29,706 --> 00:09:32,064
Oh, yeah. What are you still doing awake?

136
00:09:32,283 --> 00:09:34,064
I've a couple of exams coming up.

137
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:35,241
I see.

138
00:09:35,684 --> 00:09:37,662
Well, don't push yourself too hard, OK?

139
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:39,589
Kay. You too, dad.

140
00:09:59,651 --> 00:10:02,798
I wouldn't be surprised if one
of the others contacted Near.

141
00:10:02,823 --> 00:10:03,984
It's inevitable.

142
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:05,923
The problem is what comes after that.

143
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:08,067
If I'm too late to act,

144
00:10:08,177 --> 00:10:10,995
something might happen that I won't be able to take back.

145
00:10:15,194 --> 00:10:17,144
I've got no choice but to do it.

146
00:10:19,932 --> 00:10:22,783
Oh! An emergency order from Light! Yay!

147
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,879
Hm. File number three.

148
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:29,841
Huh?

149
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:35,554
No way.

150
00:10:39,665 --> 00:10:41,425
Yes? This is Near.

151
00:10:42,194 --> 00:10:44,265
I'm with the Japanese task force.

152
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:45,665
My name is Aizawa.

153
00:10:58,721 --> 00:11:01,521
So, the time has finally come.

154
00:11:01,546 --> 00:11:06,448
If I do this my safety is guaranteed,
and I can finally just to be a normal wife.

155
00:11:06,764 --> 00:11:08,492
This is what Light wants for me.

156
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:11,684
He wants me to be happy, just as a woman should be.

157
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:14,346
Thank you, Light.

158
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,643
I see. That's very interesting.

159
00:11:19,701 --> 00:11:22,306
You're saying there were two
suspects in the Kira investigation

160
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:25,157
that the previous L detained for more than 50 days,

161
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:28,366
and they were cleared based on the 13 day rule. Correct?

162
00:11:28,976 --> 00:11:32,322
Yes. But of course, that alone
doesn't come prove they were Kira.

163
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:34,757
And L was willing to release them because of that?

164
00:11:34,782 --> 00:11:35,412
No.

165
00:11:35,457 --> 00:11:39,901
L had Deputy Director Yagami, the chief
detective at the time, put on an act.

166
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:45,449
He was instructed to tell the suspects that they had
both been found guilty of being Kira and the second Kira,

167
00:11:45,475 --> 00:11:47,245
and that they were going to be executed.

168
00:11:47,842 --> 00:11:51,998
Then on the way, the deputy director
pulled over and pointed a gun at the suspects.

169
00:11:52,023 --> 00:11:54,869
He said that he would first kill Kira, then himself.

170
00:11:57,198 --> 00:12:02,587
The idea was that if he were Kira, the suspect
would have killed the chief right then and there.

171
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:06,352
Kira is quite impressive.

172
00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:09,873
He must have used his detainment
to demonstrate his innocence.

173
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:11,075
Well done.

174
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:16,567
Out of curiosity, did the suspect volunteer
to be detained as part of the investigation?

175
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:17,521
Hm.

176
00:12:18,177 --> 00:12:21,990
Come to think of it, Light did volunteer to be imprisoned.

177
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:26,492
If he did, then I'd say that settles the matter.

178
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:27,295
Wouldn't you?

179
00:12:27,794 --> 00:12:29,206
So, who was it?

180
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,369
Who were those two suspects?

181
00:12:31,878 --> 00:12:33,552
I can't tell you that much.

182
00:12:33,617 --> 00:12:37,963
I'm willing to cooperate, but I'm still a
member of the Japanese task force working under L.

183
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,240
I understand.

184
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,844
Thank you very much.

185
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:43,668
You information's been quite valuable,

186
00:12:43,768 --> 00:12:48,267
especially the part about Shinigami's eyes
that enable you to see other peoples' names.

187
00:12:48,454 --> 00:12:49,308
It was very helpful.

188
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:50,327
Goodbye.

189
00:12:50,883 --> 00:12:51,488
Hm.

190
00:12:58,104 --> 00:12:59,376
Will that be enough, Near?

191
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,768
Shouldn't you have pressed for a little more information?

192
00:13:01,793 --> 00:13:05,530
I think that all things considered,
his level of cooperation is fine for now.

193
00:13:05,555 --> 00:13:10,047
And besides, I discovered something very important.

194
00:13:10,594 --> 00:13:14,474
The person suspected of being
Kira is Deputy Director Yagami's son.

195
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,649
It's the only possible explanation.

196
00:13:17,846 --> 00:13:21,748
Why else would the deputy director
say he would kill Kira, and then himself?

197
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:25,696
Therefore, tha tmeans the second L,

198
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:28,721
and the person I think is Kira, can only be one man.

199
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:31,331
Light Yagami.

200
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:41,606
Light.

201
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:43,239
Yes?

202
00:13:43,717 --> 00:13:45,417
There's something you should know.

203
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:47,336
I phoned Near and talked to him.

204
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:53,899
Don't worry about it.

205
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,534
After all, I was the one who recommended it.

206
00:13:56,648 --> 00:13:59,243
So, what did the two of you end up discussing?

207
00:14:00,398 --> 00:14:02,539
No, on second thought, I probably shouldn't ask.

208
00:14:02,564 --> 00:14:06,350
I guess it's not appropriate for me to ask
those kinds of questions if I'm a suspect.

209
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,762
Hm.

210
00:14:08,743 --> 00:14:09,776
Don't get me wrong.

211
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:11,865
I want to believe that you aren't Kira,

212
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,318
but I've got to be certain.

213
00:14:13,343 --> 00:14:14,812
I'm sorry to have to do this again,

214
00:14:14,837 --> 00:14:17,744
but I want to put you under
surveillance until we catch Kira.

215
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:20,588
I'm afraid that goes for Misa Amane as well.

216
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:22,856
I'm going to search your place right now.

217
00:14:23,087 --> 00:14:25,840
There's a possibility that Amane might have a notebook.

218
00:14:26,121 --> 00:14:27,715
Hang on a second, Aizawa!

219
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:28,630
No.

220
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:30,612
Go right ahead. Look at this way.

221
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:32,071
At least you can prove to everyone

222
00:14:32,096 --> 00:14:35,546
that I'm not sneaking around and
contacting Misa in private, right?

223
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,219
Huh?

224
00:14:49,918 --> 00:14:50,706
Mogi?

225
00:14:51,197 --> 00:14:52,104
I'm coming with you.

226
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:53,581
I want to make sure, too.

227
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:01,652
It would be best for everyone if Light wasn't Kira.

228
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:06,283
But if Amane has any evidence on her
that connects her with Kira, then...

229
00:15:34,006 --> 00:15:34,742
Huh?

230
00:15:34,795 --> 00:15:39,700
Motchi, Monchichi, long time no see, you two!

231
00:15:39,795 --> 00:15:43,772
Light hasn't been home at all
lately, so I've been super bored.

232
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:44,877
Uh...

233
00:15:45,187 --> 00:15:48,529
Well, there's no way she's got the
notebook hidden under a dress like that.

234
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:52,432
We were just investigating a tip that
there were explosives planted in L's house.

235
00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:55,494
We think it's a prank, but we'd
like to check the rooms, just in case.

236
00:15:55,777 --> 00:15:57,906
What? How about Light? Is he OK?

237
00:15:57,931 --> 00:15:58,754
I have to call him.

238
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:00,334
No. You can't call him right now.

239
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,367
How come?

240
00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:02,601
Don't worry.

241
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:04,734
Light's safe, but he's really busy right now.

242
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,326
He has some other things he has to do,

243
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:09,223
so he's handed the investigation
over to us for the time being.

244
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:10,844
Oh, I get it.

245
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:12,237
Light loves me like crazy,

246
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:13,731
so he doesn't want me to call him,

247
00:16:13,756 --> 00:16:15,852
'cause that'll only make him worry about me.

248
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:19,440
Search as much as you like, Aizawa.

249
00:16:20,432 --> 00:16:22,219
You won't find the notebook.

250
00:16:32,555 --> 00:16:35,793
I wouldn't like all the suspicion
to ruin the atmosphere around here.

251
00:16:35,938 --> 00:16:37,933
This isn't a social club.

252
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:40,632
I think Aizawa and Mogi should do as they see fit.

253
00:16:42,864 --> 00:16:44,386
It's time for Kira's Kingdom.

254
00:16:52,532 --> 00:16:55,565
Greetings to all my fellow Kira worshippers.

255
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,755
I am Demegawa, the voice of our god, Kira.

256
00:16:58,902 --> 00:16:59,884
Behold!

257
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,083
This is the new Kira's Kingdom,

258
00:17:02,142 --> 00:17:04,371
which shares its name with this program.

259
00:17:04,484 --> 00:17:06,447
Its construction is going smoothly,

260
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:09,805
but will depend on the generous
support of our loyal viewers.

261
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:14,500
Once it has been completed, let us welcome our god here!

262
00:17:14,611 --> 00:17:16,563
Whoa. Talk about bad taste.

263
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:24,904
Hey, so is everything OK?

264
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,078
Oh, yeah. Seems like it was just a prank.

265
00:17:27,365 --> 00:17:28,108
Oh.

266
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:31,907
But just in case, one of us is going to stay
and keep watch over you for the next few days.

267
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:33,747
Really? Oh, that would be great.

268
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:36,710
Mogi, why don't you go back to headquarters?

269
00:17:36,743 --> 00:17:37,914
I'll say on guard here.

270
00:17:37,979 --> 00:17:40,799
Huh? I'm with Monchichi instead of Motchi?

271
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,179
What's wrong? Don't you trust me?

272
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:46,607
No. You're just not Monchichi without your old haircut.

273
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,018
You're not cute anymore.

274
00:17:49,432 --> 00:17:50,388
Mogi!

275
00:17:50,413 --> 00:17:51,668
Yes, sir. My apologies.

276
00:17:51,876 --> 00:17:53,479
All right. You stay.

277
00:17:54,977 --> 00:17:56,816
We are now accepting donations,

278
00:17:57,043 --> 00:18:00,654
starting at the million yen mark
towards the completion of Kira's Kingdom.

279
00:18:00,837 --> 00:18:02,211
So, if you truly...

280
00:18:02,236 --> 00:18:03,678
This sounds like a con.

281
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:06,409
Yep. Just another scam at this point.

282
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,555
It doesn't even seem like Kira's style.

283
00:18:10,231 --> 00:18:11,429
Demegawa.

284
00:18:11,654 --> 00:18:13,621
He's just acting on his own now.

285
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:17,118
If he keeps doing this, he'll end
up pushing people away from Kira.

286
00:18:17,653 --> 00:18:19,264
I don't need him anymore.

287
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,488
But I can't do much at the moment.

288
00:18:26,818 --> 00:18:28,558
Hey. Welcome back, Aizawa.

289
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:33,831
We didn't find a notebook in Light's or Misa's room.

290
00:18:34,428 --> 00:18:35,117
But still...

291
00:18:35,142 --> 00:18:36,117
I understand.

292
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:40,019
You're more than welcome to keep watch
over Misa and I until you're satisfied.

293
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:47,051
Next on the program, it's time for me to introduce
the new leaders I have chosen for Kira's Kingdom.

294
00:18:51,054 --> 00:18:52,894
The first gentleman is...

295
00:18:52,943 --> 00:18:53,806
Delete.

296
00:19:01,476 --> 00:19:04,446
We will unite with Kira, and work with him.

297
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:05,793
Delete!

298
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:11,085
Delete!

299
00:19:12,453 --> 00:19:13,613
Delete!

300
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:26,709
Save me.

301
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,350
And delete.

302
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:50,475
Wha... What the hell is this?

303
00:19:50,653 --> 00:19:52,978
Why would Kira kill his own supporters?

304
00:19:53,003 --> 00:19:55,088
Do you think it's because
they're going overboard with this?

305
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:57,838
That might be a possibility.

306
00:19:58,273 --> 00:19:59,788
But this is horrible.

307
00:20:00,353 --> 00:20:01,486
What's going on?

308
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:06,131
There was no chance for either Misa Amane
or Light to use the notebook to kill Demegawa.

309
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:08,946
Mikami.

310
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,574
I can definitely use him.

311
00:20:11,688 --> 00:20:13,902
It seems I was right to choose him for this.

312
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:17,226
He understands Kira's beliefs and ideals perfectly,

313
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:20,034
and he knows what Kira wants and doesn't want.

314
00:20:20,143 --> 00:20:23,661
Thanks to that, he takes action without needing my orders.

315
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:26,796
I had Misa relinquish ownership of the Death Note.

316
00:20:26,866 --> 00:20:30,801
Before she lost all her memories of
the notebook, she sent it to someone else,

317
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,127
along with some special instructions.

318
00:20:33,676 --> 00:20:36,642
Now she won't be able to answer any questions about it.

319
00:20:36,865 --> 00:20:38,898
She's just an ordinary woman.

320
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,946
The main problem was selecting the next owner.

321
00:20:42,554 --> 00:20:45,857
I saw him trying to speak to Kira
through the television broadcasts.

322
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:49,176
It was clear he worshiped Kira
from the bottom of this heart.

323
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:54,061
He would understand that he was chosen
simply by receiving and accepting the notebook.

324
00:20:57,912 --> 00:21:00,523
There was no mistake in my selection.

325
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:02,896
Teru Mikami.

326
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:07,624
He's more than worthy of becoming the hand of Kira.

327
00:21:08,276 --> 00:21:09,385
Shinigami.

328
00:21:09,665 --> 00:21:11,182
Thank you for coming to me.

329
00:21:11,241 --> 00:21:14,064
Now I'll be able to punish evildoers with death.

330
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:21,746
God.

331
00:22:37,116 --> 00:22:40,116
You're a woman who the entire world pays attention to.

332
00:22:40,168 --> 00:22:43,187
It must be fate for us to cross paths again like this.

333
00:22:43,212 --> 00:22:45,851
Please, just listen to what I
have to say first, all right?

334
00:22:46,188 --> 00:22:47,568
Let's meet somewhere.

335
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:49,215
Alone.
