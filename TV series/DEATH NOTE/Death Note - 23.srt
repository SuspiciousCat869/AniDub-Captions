1
00:01:26,668 --> 00:01:29,224
So you're saying one of those people is Kira, right?

2
00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:29,790
Yes.

3
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:31,968
I've got a lot of evidence to prove it, too.

4
00:01:31,993 --> 00:01:34,292
The man who died was Mr. H

5
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:34,829
Kira...

6
00:01:34,854 --> 00:01:37,267
If Higuchi can kill by looking at someone's face

7
00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:41,092
like the second Kira was able to, Matsuda will die.

8
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:47,611
It's... It's him!

9
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:49,256
Don't screw with me!

10
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:52,373
Why the hell can't you remember
the names of the people you hire?

11
00:01:52,797 --> 00:01:54,728
That means I have two hours.

12
00:02:07,687 --> 00:02:08,774
I see Higuchi.

13
00:02:09,018 --> 00:02:10,769
He's only carrying a single bag.

14
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:11,921
I'm in pursuit.

15
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:12,900
I'll kill him.

16
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,391
I'll kill him no matter what.

17
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:17,448
I'm not giving up until I have everything.

18
00:02:20,953 --> 00:02:22,753
Cosme Misa.

19
00:02:22,778 --> 00:02:25,785
A devlish charm, an angel's glitter.

20
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,940
Misa's new line of lipstick just for you.

21
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:33,367
Ryuzaki, the commercial's almost over.

22
00:02:33,962 --> 00:02:34,864
Is that so?

23
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:35,881
Next thing you know,

24
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,992
I'm in a hotel room drinking with all eight of them.

25
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,949
Well, that's rather amusing.

26
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,855
But if I give you any more details,

27
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,146
I'm afraid the people who were
there that night would realize

28
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:46,572
which one of them is Kira,

29
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:48,867
so I think I'd better leave it at that for now.

30
00:02:49,106 --> 00:02:49,942
Of course.

31
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:53,783
Please take your time to tell us all
the details of your ordeal to find Kira.

32
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:54,790
Light.

33
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:58,844
Please put Higuchi's car on audio
channel one, and Sakura TV on channel two.

34
00:02:58,911 --> 00:03:02,480
As expected, Higuchi's watching
every minute of this from his car.

35
00:03:02,787 --> 00:03:03,920
And so according to you,

36
00:03:03,945 --> 00:03:06,804
it was actually at that party that you met Kira.

37
00:03:07,058 --> 00:03:11,213
Yes. But of course, at the time I had
no way of knowing he was actually Kira.

38
00:03:11,535 --> 00:03:13,486
So that means he saw your face?

39
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:14,378
This is incredible.

40
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:17,938
I think it's amazingly courageous of you
to step forward and appear on this program.

41
00:03:17,963 --> 00:03:19,130
Are you sure you're OK with it?

42
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:19,853
Yes.

43
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:21,688
After I started investigating him,

44
00:03:21,747 --> 00:03:25,143
I found out there are two things Kira
has to have in order to kill someone.

45
00:03:25,923 --> 00:03:31,025
There are rumors on TV and the internet as to
what those two things might be, but I know the truth.

46
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,853
A name and a face.

47
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:37,883
But Kira only knows one of those two things
about me, so that means I should be safe.

48
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:42,479
So, he's saying he feels safe enough to step
forward just because I don't know his real name.

49
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:43,851
Wait a minute.

50
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:47,257
Does that mean there's nothing
left that can connect me to his name?

51
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:49,622
Maybe he's already destroyed his file at Yoshida.

52
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:51,384
Am I wasting my time?

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,434
Rem.

54
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:55,145
What do you think?

55
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:58,023
What do I think? About what, may I ask?

56
00:03:58,394 --> 00:04:00,074
Rem? Who's that?

57
00:04:00,168 --> 00:04:02,554
There's no one else in that car, right?

58
00:04:02,836 --> 00:04:05,775
It's impossible for someone
to be hiding without us knowing.

59
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:07,753
He isn't using his cell phone.

60
00:04:08,212 --> 00:04:09,750
Could it be a hidden radio?

61
00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:10,398
No.

62
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:12,819
There aren't any radios or other devices.

63
00:04:13,023 --> 00:04:16,893
Only the bugs, cameras, and
tracking beacons that Weddy placed.

64
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:19,313
I have no doubt that she did a thorough job.

65
00:04:19,473 --> 00:04:23,472
Do you think I'll get to Yoshida
Productions only to find his file isn't there?

66
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:25,556
Is he talking to himself?

67
00:04:25,923 --> 00:04:27,524
Why ask my opinion?

68
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:30,349
I don't see how I'm supposed to know something like that.

69
00:04:30,374 --> 00:04:35,706
If this guy was smart, he would destroy everything that
connects him with his real name before he appeared on TV.

70
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:37,779
And don't you think it's a little too reckless

71
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:41,306
for Yoshida Productions to just let
me into their offices unsupervised?

72
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:42,305
Not. Maybe not.

73
00:04:42,376 --> 00:04:46,919
If there was a robbery, they'd figure out right
away who did it, since I know where the key is.

74
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:49,175
This is sounding very good.

75
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:50,590
He'll still go there.

76
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:51,925
Don't you worry.

77
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:54,552
Even if he does have a file at Yoshida,

78
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,697
it could be just another alias.

79
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:57,567
Damn it!

80
00:04:57,901 --> 00:05:00,670
I wouldn't put it past this guy to do something like that.

81
00:05:00,695 --> 00:05:02,152
No wonder he's confident.

82
00:05:02,745 --> 00:05:07,822
It must be Light and Misa's plan to
have Higuchi go to Yoshida Productions.

83
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:09,347
If that's the case...

84
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:12,739
That may be true, but if he knows that you are Kira,

85
00:05:12,764 --> 00:05:15,035
he's going to announce your name in public.

86
00:05:15,078 --> 00:05:17,035
That's an inescapable fact.

87
00:05:17,244 --> 00:05:17,877
All right.

88
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:20,411
There's only one hour left until the big announcement.

89
00:05:20,724 --> 00:05:22,857
Your only option is to go.

90
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,713
If the name on his file is false, that'll be unfortunate.

91
00:05:26,756 --> 00:05:30,496
But if it isn't, you can kill
him discretely with the notebook.

92
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:33,063
Yeah. I already know that much myself,

93
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:34,618
but just to be on the safe side,

94
00:05:34,643 --> 00:05:37,668
I should also kill the people I
contacted at Yoshida Productions.

95
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:40,854
That includes the president,
Misa, and that manager of hers.

96
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,368
What? No way. He's gonna kill me?

97
00:05:43,393 --> 00:05:44,587
It's all right. Don't worry.

98
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:47,490
He's talking about doing that after he's killed Matsuda.

99
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:51,375
There'd be no point in killing the rest of
you until he's gotten rid of the main threat.

100
00:05:51,764 --> 00:05:53,263
That's true, but still.

101
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,754
Don't be reckless.

102
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:56,698
He's the only one you have to kill.

103
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:02,937
If the people you called end up dying too, the
phone records will implicate you in their deaths.

104
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:04,234
Oh yeah.

105
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:06,578
Rem, I didn't think you were so smart.

106
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:10,477
Then I'll make them all erase
their call histories before they die.

107
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:14,281
But the telephone company will
still have a record of the calls.

108
00:06:14,368 --> 00:06:16,712
There's no way he can just be talking to himself.

109
00:06:16,737 --> 00:06:18,104
But who's Rem?

110
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:19,556
Who is he talking to?

111
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:25,510
If he's talking to someone
right now, it could be a Shinigami.

112
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:29,053
Perhaps.

113
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,865
I should just go ahead and ask him.

114
00:06:33,556 --> 00:06:37,080
How about giving up ownership of
the notebook and returning it to me.

115
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:37,597
No.

116
00:06:37,622 --> 00:06:39,537
I'd end up being ruined if I did that.

117
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:43,820
Even if I forgot the notebook, this guy
says he has concrete evidence to back him up.

118
00:06:43,845 --> 00:06:46,684
If he points out Yotsuba's recent growth on the air,

119
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,386
no one would ever doubt his claims.

120
00:06:48,438 --> 00:06:49,838
They'd believe whatever he said.

121
00:06:49,863 --> 00:06:53,622
That means whoever he says is Kira will be marked as Kira.

122
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,298
Even if he didn't have proof and I got rid of the evidence

123
00:06:57,323 --> 00:06:59,757
by returning the notebook, my life would be over.

124
00:06:59,782 --> 00:07:03,250
I wouldn't get promoted. I wouldn't
even be able to stay with Yotsuba.

125
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:08,101
Of course, Sakura TV has broadcast this show
under the premise that right now, as we speak,

126
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:10,017
Kira is watching this program.

127
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:12,775
In that case, I'll take this chance to call out to him.

128
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,426
Kira! Please, turn yourself in!

129
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,390
This guy's acting like a complete idiot.

130
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:22,413
Still, he was smart enough to fake
his own death to avoid being killed.

131
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,445
I have to kill him as soon as possible.

132
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:30,773
He's arrived at Yoshida Productions.

133
00:07:31,004 --> 00:07:32,675
The show is about to begin.

134
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:52,301
To the left as I come in.

135
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,684
In the desk at the very back.

136
00:07:57,656 --> 00:07:59,011
Very bottom drawer.

137
00:08:17,943 --> 00:08:19,301
Now, Kira.

138
00:08:19,326 --> 00:08:20,660
How do you kill?

139
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:22,035
Show me.

140
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:26,942
We're in position and ready to take him down.

141
00:08:27,103 --> 00:08:28,462
We'll move on your command.

142
00:08:28,728 --> 00:08:29,350
Right.

143
00:08:38,845 --> 00:08:39,878
He's not doing it!

144
00:08:39,903 --> 00:08:41,892
He just made a note of his name before leaving.

145
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:43,830
So he's not gonna kill him here?

146
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:45,790
Ryuzaki, do you want us to apprehend him?

147
00:08:46,018 --> 00:08:48,605
Negative. We still don't know how he kills.

148
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:51,915
Perhaps he's planning to do
something once he's back in the car.

149
00:08:52,057 --> 00:08:53,455
Let's see camera one again.

150
00:08:59,111 --> 00:08:59,997
It's weird.

151
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:04,189
You'd think you'd be desperate to kill
Matsuda this very second, but he's calm.

152
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:05,550
It is strange.

153
00:09:05,738 --> 00:09:09,419
If all he needed was the name, then he
should've simply taken the personnel file with him,

154
00:09:09,444 --> 00:09:11,788
but he just put it back in his drawer after taking a note.

155
00:09:12,112 --> 00:09:18,390
36, 37, 38, 39, 40 seconds.

156
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,353
Kira is a cold-blooded murderer.

157
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:23,530
I can't forgive him for what he's done.

158
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:26,126
Damn! He didn't die!

159
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:27,675
Wh... What's he talking about?

160
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,361
He said he didn't die.

161
00:09:29,386 --> 00:09:31,579
Did he already try and kill Matsuda?

162
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,733
Was writing his name down all he had to do, or was it...

163
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:36,123
What do we do now?

164
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:38,688
Should we just continue watching what he's doing?

165
00:09:38,713 --> 00:09:41,545
What if he can cause a death by just imagining it?

166
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:44,195
I don't understand what's going on.

167
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,027
I still can't figure out how he kills people.

168
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:50,185
But even if we restrain him
now and try to get him to confess.

169
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,023
Only 50 minutes to go until the big Kira announcement...

170
00:09:53,048 --> 00:09:55,148
Damn! I don't have any time!

171
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:57,301
He's making a phone call.

172
00:09:57,326 --> 00:09:58,593
It's probably Misa again.

173
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:00,226
Yeah!

174
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,498
Argh!

175
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:09,609
All right. Calm down.

176
00:10:09,634 --> 00:10:10,967
I already know his face.

177
00:10:10,992 --> 00:10:15,181
If I go back to company HQ, there should
be surveillance videos from when he snuck in.

178
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:19,686
If I had the Shinigami eyes...
half my remaining lifespan, huh?

179
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:20,704
That's a lot.

180
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:23,998
But if he makes that announcement,
my life's as good as over anyway.

181
00:10:24,734 --> 00:10:27,122
Better to have a life that's short and sweet.

182
00:10:30,136 --> 00:10:32,113
Rem. Let's make the deal.

183
00:10:33,311 --> 00:10:34,415
The deal?

184
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,963
Who is this Rem person he keeps talking to?

185
00:10:37,022 --> 00:10:41,032
Could it really be that Kira's power
comes from another world or some being?

186
00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:43,367
I really don't want to think that's the case.

187
00:10:43,623 --> 00:10:45,648
Then what is this Rem?

188
00:10:46,096 --> 00:10:47,137
A Shinigami?

189
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:50,445
Whatever it is, we need to keep watching him.

190
00:10:50,601 --> 00:10:52,567
We'll learn nothing if we take him now.

191
00:10:52,592 --> 00:10:55,765
We may still be able to find out how he kills.

192
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:01,757
With these yes, I'm invincible.

193
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,423
I have more than enough options now.

194
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:08,517
We're heading after him.

195
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,152
You in the red car!

196
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,167
Pull over to the side of the road. Now!

197
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:24,552
This is bad.

198
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:26,744
Higuchi's been pulled over by a traffic cop.

199
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:29,524
I'm gonna have to pass him and
leave the pursuit to Aiber's team.

200
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,483
You were speeding.

201
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:33,112
License, please?

202
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:34,683
Yeah. No problem.

203
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:37,354
Switch all screens to Higuchi's car.

204
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:38,870
Now, let's see.

205
00:11:38,895 --> 00:11:40,663
Where did I put it?

206
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:44,673
This'll take care of him.

207
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:49,873
Hey!

208
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:53,041
Higuchi ditched the cop. He's driving away!

209
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:57,520
What a bastard.

210
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:00,370
This is Traffic Control Squad...

211
00:12:05,612 --> 00:12:08,241
That motorcycle cop just rear ended that truck!

212
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:09,158
He's dead!

213
00:12:09,183 --> 00:12:11,110
He's dead? By accident?

214
00:12:11,202 --> 00:12:12,705
This is very bad.

215
00:12:13,335 --> 00:12:15,588
All he did was put his hand in his bag.

216
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:17,638
Could he have done something at that moment?

217
00:12:17,663 --> 00:12:22,364
More importantly, how was he able to
obtain the name of the cop who stopped him?

218
00:12:22,538 --> 00:12:25,341
Does he only need a face, like the second Kira?

219
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,690
Rem. A deal.

220
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:29,723
No.

221
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:34,365
If he had the power to kill just by looking at someone's
face, he would have already killed Matsuda by now.

222
00:12:34,668 --> 00:12:36,186
What's going on?

223
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:38,065
Unless...

224
00:12:38,665 --> 00:12:39,512
Everyone!

225
00:12:39,956 --> 00:12:42,609
It's too dangerous to allow further action by Higuchi.

226
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:44,110
Let's bring him in.

227
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,142
I believe he has the same powers as the second Kira.

228
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:52,673
He is able to kill just by looking at someone's face.
Please keep this in mind when you move in to arrest him.

229
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:13,276
Watari, connect me to the director of the NPA.

230
00:13:13,546 --> 00:13:14,271
Yes.

231
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:19,426
This is L. We are now aware of Kira's true identity.

232
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:25,458
He is currently heading from Hibiya to
Shibuya along Highway Route 1 in a red sports car.

233
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:27,443
Our group will be handling the arrest.

234
00:13:27,468 --> 00:13:32,049
In the meantime, please instruct all
officers to refrain from approaching his car.

235
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:33,642
All right.

236
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,006
Dad, during the next commercial, take measure seven.

237
00:13:36,121 --> 00:13:37,218
Understood.

238
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:41,599
Demegawa, during the next commercial
break, swap Matsuda and the MC with mannequins.

239
00:13:41,624 --> 00:13:46,207
We'll make it seem as if the broadcast is continuing
as normal using the voices we've already prepared.

240
00:13:46,232 --> 00:13:49,158
We'll leave the cameras running and
have everyone evacuate the building.

241
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,790
So then, Light, what say we go and join the fun as well?

242
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:53,714
Yeah.

243
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,723
Hm?

244
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,113
I'm sorry to do this, Misa,

245
00:13:58,282 --> 00:14:00,874
but I'm going to have to make
sure you're restrained for a while.

246
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:01,642
What?

247
00:14:01,948 --> 00:14:05,096
But that's... stop joking around!

248
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,671
I didn't realize you could pilot a helicopter.

249
00:14:13,696 --> 00:14:14,796
That's incredible.

250
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:17,254
Well, you can figure it out with intuition.

251
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,097
Hm?

252
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:22,401
Higuchi isn't going to Sakura TV.

253
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,959
He's headed the wrong way.

254
00:14:24,026 --> 00:14:28,057
Based on his route, I'd guess he's
going to the Yotsuba main office.

255
00:14:28,126 --> 00:14:30,263
You've been outstandingly brave.

256
00:14:30,288 --> 00:14:30,930
No.

257
00:14:30,981 --> 00:14:32,842
I'm just doing what anyone would do.

258
00:14:33,136 --> 00:14:37,606
If I go to the main office and find a
surveillance video with him on it, I can kill him.

259
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:38,783
Come in, Weddy.

260
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:43,209
Have you removed absolutely everything
relating to Matsuda at the Yotsuba headquarters.

261
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:45,343
Yeah. Why? Is he headed there now?

262
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:47,411
Isn't that convenient?

263
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,335
That should give me mroe than enough time

264
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,685
to go ahead and meet up with
Mr. Yagami to set up the ambush.

265
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:59,263
What the hell? I can't find him!

266
00:14:59,288 --> 00:15:00,740
This is the right tape.

267
00:15:00,765 --> 00:15:02,785
Someone must have erased it.

268
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:04,866
Come back and erase them himself somehow?

269
00:15:04,891 --> 00:15:08,093
Or has someone from the group
betrayed me and started working with him?

270
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,065
No.

271
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,723
Doing that wouldn't absolve them of their crimes.

272
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:17,199
Who cares? I'm out of time. I've got to hurry!

273
00:15:19,457 --> 00:15:21,857
We're quickly approaching the time for the announcement.

274
00:15:21,882 --> 00:15:22,853
How are you feeling?

275
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:24,525
I feel ready for this.

276
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,325
I really want to reveal it now.

277
00:15:27,115 --> 00:15:28,704
Yes, I understand.

278
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:31,637
But let's cut to a quick commercial break first.

279
00:15:31,662 --> 00:15:32,609
Damit!

280
00:15:32,634 --> 00:15:35,607
I'll just have to go to Sakura TV and kill him there.

281
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:41,237
Dad, Higuchi's left Yotsuba.

282
00:15:41,276 --> 00:15:43,009
He's on his way to Sakura TV.

283
00:15:43,034 --> 00:15:44,667
He'll be there in less than 15 minutes.

284
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:45,560
Are you ready?

285
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:48,580
I don't need my son asking if I'm ready.

286
00:15:48,803 --> 00:15:50,034
Of course I am.

287
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:54,845
Is there anything more you'd
like to add before the announcement?

288
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:58,417
Well, I want everyone to think
hard about Kira after he's caught.

289
00:15:58,442 --> 00:15:59,979
People have to realize that Kira is...

290
00:16:00,004 --> 00:16:02,529
You ready, Mr. Yagami? It's almost time.

291
00:16:02,656 --> 00:16:03,600
I know.

292
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:04,427
Here.

293
00:16:04,808 --> 00:16:05,444
Hm?

294
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:08,750
Aiber hates using guns. Right now I'm the only one armed.

295
00:16:08,775 --> 00:16:09,330
Take it.

296
00:16:09,892 --> 00:16:12,820
I can't take this. I'm no longer a police officer.

297
00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:15,256
Japanese law forbids civilians from having guns.

298
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:17,408
That means you shouldn't be using one, either.

299
00:16:18,037 --> 00:16:20,225
I guess you're as stubborn as always, huh?

300
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:25,498
I made it in time.

301
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,468
Why isn't anybody here?

302
00:16:36,915 --> 00:16:40,739
Is it just in case the announcement
is true, and Kira decides to retaliate?

303
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:41,894
Hm.

304
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:44,405
At least it makes my job easier.

305
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,057
We've arrived at Sakura TV.

306
00:16:48,271 --> 00:16:49,687
We're moving into position.

307
00:16:50,581 --> 00:16:51,844
Let's go, Aiber!

308
00:16:51,869 --> 00:16:53,482
OK, Mogi.

309
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:56,361
Right now we're being flooded with phone calls

310
00:16:56,386 --> 00:16:59,171
and faxes showing support for your courage and strength,

311
00:16:59,196 --> 00:17:02,339
and demanding that Kira's identity be revealed right away.

312
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:03,460
Huh?

313
00:17:03,859 --> 00:17:05,642
Even the studio is deserted.

314
00:17:07,004 --> 00:17:09,761
Still, I gotta be careful of where the cameras are.

315
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,932
Can't let myself be seen.

316
00:17:10,957 --> 00:17:13,360
Due to circumstances beyond our
control, we will now end this broadcast.

317
00:17:13,385 --> 00:17:13,986
Huh?

318
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:14,726
What?

319
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:16,345
Dummies?

320
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:17,978
This can't be!

321
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:20,201
Higuchi. Hold it right there.

322
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,480
Don't move.

323
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:24,834
Huh?

324
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:28,666
I'd give up if I were you.

325
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:32,042
You... You must be making some kind of mistake.

326
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:35,544
I'm only here to meet with Mr. Demegawa
and discuss something with him.

327
00:17:35,581 --> 00:17:37,014
They're wearing tinted helmets.

328
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,177
They must be taking precautions against Kira.

329
00:17:39,318 --> 00:17:42,451
In that case... I'm with the Yotsuba Group,

330
00:17:42,537 --> 00:17:44,112
from the Development Department.

331
00:17:44,214 --> 00:17:46,149
Let me show you my business card.

332
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,368
No! Chief!

333
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:55,283
Aiber!

334
00:17:56,926 --> 00:17:59,256
Dammit. I didn't want to have to use one of these.

335
00:17:59,281 --> 00:18:00,037
But...

336
00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:07,021
L, Higuchi has a gun on him.

337
00:18:07,094 --> 00:18:08,370
The chief's been shot.

338
00:18:08,626 --> 00:18:09,888
Higuchi's escaping!

339
00:18:09,913 --> 00:18:10,855
I'm all right.

340
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,205
Sorry, Ryuzaki.

341
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:14,908
If we pursue him right now, we can still catch him.

342
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,270
Hurry!

343
00:18:16,314 --> 00:18:17,214
This is bad.

344
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:19,315
He's escaped from Sakura TV.

345
00:18:28,214 --> 00:18:29,781
This leaves us no choice.

346
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:32,262
We'll have to move in and apprehend him.

347
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:33,729
Watari, are you ready?

348
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:35,377
Yes.

349
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,808
Light, I think you should hold onto this for self defense.

350
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:41,570
This is Kira we're after.

351
00:18:42,437 --> 00:18:43,260
No thanks.

352
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:45,152
Firearms aren't allowed in Japan.

353
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:49,311
You know, I'm sure your father
would say the exact same thing.

354
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,431
He's driving like a maniac.

355
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:02,697
Don't lose sight of him.

356
00:19:02,722 --> 00:19:03,369
Yes, sir.

357
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:17,109
What the hell was all that about?

358
00:19:17,368 --> 00:19:18,943
Had to be a trap.

359
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:22,635
We now end our current broadcast
and return you to regular programming.

360
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,222
The Evening News is next.

361
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:25,588
The program's over?

362
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:28,000
It didn't end just because I showed up?

363
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,917
What the hell is going on?

364
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,948
Ah! What the...

365
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,644
Just like I thought.

366
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:41,778
It was a trap.

367
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,713
All these cars with tinted windows.

368
00:19:43,738 --> 00:19:46,896
So, all that stuff about the
cops not going after Kira was a lie!

369
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:48,628
They've been preparing for this.

370
00:19:49,448 --> 00:19:50,481
What's happening?

371
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:53,977
I thought we told the police not
to get involved with the arrest.

372
00:19:54,002 --> 00:19:55,869
The only one who would do this is...

373
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,690
Yes. You must be right.

374
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:22,461
Damn it!

375
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:23,956
That way.

376
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,649
Stop right there.

377
00:20:48,302 --> 00:20:49,153
Stay back!

378
00:20:49,198 --> 00:20:51,201
Stay back or I'll shoot, I swear!

379
00:21:03,886 --> 00:21:04,966
It's over.

380
00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:08,158
Yes. It's over.

381
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,855
A human whose name is written in this notebook shall die.

382
00:22:39,939 --> 00:22:41,826
This note will not take effect unless the writer

383
00:22:41,851 --> 00:22:44,885
has the person's face in their
mind when writing his or her name.

384
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,037
Therefore, people sharing the
same name will not be affected.
