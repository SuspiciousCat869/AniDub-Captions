1
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:34,565
That was footage from surveillance cameras at the station.

2
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:37,758
The death of one of the FBI agents is captured on here.

3
00:01:39,304 --> 00:01:40,919
Let's see the following scenes again.

4
00:01:40,944 --> 00:01:43,400
Raye Penber passing the ticket gate on his way in,

5
00:01:43,425 --> 00:01:46,202
then him boarding the train, and finally
the part where he dies on the platform.

6
00:01:46,717 --> 00:01:47,469
OK.

7
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:49,046
Let's see.

8
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,570
I think it's next to that.

9
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:52,712
Oh, here it is.

10
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,378
Um, so based on the records I have here,

11
00:01:55,403 --> 00:02:00,043
Ray Penber comes through the west
entrance of Shinjuku Station at 3:11 PM.

12
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,848
Then at 3:13, he boards a train on the Yamanote line.

13
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,119
But even if he was following someone at that time,

14
00:02:06,285 --> 00:02:10,398
I think it's going to be very difficult for us to
draw any real conclusions from this blurry video.

15
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:13,670
Then at exactly 4:42 PM

16
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:16,199
oh, thank you very much, Watari.

17
00:02:16,773 --> 00:02:22,881
Um, and at 4:42 PM, he exits a train at
Tokyo station and dies on the platform.

18
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:25,118
It's quite strange, don't you think?

19
00:02:25,682 --> 00:02:27,988
I'm sorry, what do you find strange?

20
00:02:28,027 --> 00:02:28,869
Yeah, what is it?

21
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:29,912
Did you notice something?

22
00:02:31,196 --> 00:02:32,002
Mmm.

23
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:34,204
We know that Raye Penber got on the train,

24
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:37,354
and then an hour and a half later
he got off and died on the platform.

25
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:40,236
But the Yamanote line only takes
an hour to complete its circuit.

26
00:02:40,406 --> 00:02:42,360
And more importantly, there's the envelope.

27
00:02:42,608 --> 00:02:43,860
Uh, what do you mean?

28
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:50,099
He's holding what looks like an envelope
when he passes through the ticket gate.

29
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:50,524
Huh?

30
00:02:50,778 --> 00:02:51,611
You're right!

31
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:53,177
It's there, under his arm.

32
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:56,656
But in the footage right before his death, it's gone.

33
00:02:56,897 --> 00:02:59,013
I can't believe you actually caught that.

34
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,418
Well, I don't see an envelope on
this list of his personal effects.

35
00:03:03,794 --> 00:03:06,189
Which means it was left on the train.

36
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,069
And if you watch closely at the very end here,

37
00:03:10,643 --> 00:03:14,321
it seems like he's straining to look
inside the train before the doors close.

38
00:03:14,346 --> 00:03:15,375
You can see right here.

39
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:18,271
If that's the case, do you think it could mean something?

40
00:03:18,353 --> 00:03:20,910
Wouldn't it be interesting if Kira was on that train.

41
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:22,102
That's impossible.

42
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:24,885
I admit, I find it hard to believe, as well.

43
00:03:25,512 --> 00:03:29,984
There's no reason for Kira to come to the scene
of his own crime when he can kill from a distance.

44
00:03:30,613 --> 00:03:34,444
Well, maybe he was counting on us to make that assumption

45
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:36,986
and figured he could get away with such a bold move.

46
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,128
Mmm.

47
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:42,391
Mmm.

48
00:03:44,838 --> 00:03:46,499
What's going on with you, Light?

49
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:50,830
You haven't stopped writing criminals'
names in the Death Note for four days straight.

50
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,481
So what are you trying to prove?

51
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,631
I don't see the point in writing
these names weeks in advance.

52
00:03:55,663 --> 00:03:57,904
I've never seen the Death Note used like this.

53
00:03:57,929 --> 00:03:59,304
Consider it insurance.

54
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:03,556
Suppose the son of the detective
superintendent of the NPA was hospitalized.

55
00:04:03,654 --> 00:04:07,570
If criminals stopped dying at the same time,
it wouldn't be difficult to connect the two.

56
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,483
So that's what this is.

57
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:14,382
Are you sure that I can use any date as long as it's
before the end of a person's predetermined lifespan?

58
00:04:14,702 --> 00:04:19,371
Well, I can't guarantee it because we
Shinigami don't normally work that way.

59
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:23,268
But I suppose any time before the
end of their lifespan should work.

60
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:25,632
I really can't count on you, can I?

61
00:04:25,657 --> 00:04:26,660
You got that right.

62
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:28,148
Yes?

63
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:31,246
Yes. Would you please hold for a moment?

64
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,632
Ryuzaki, it's Ukita at the NPA.

65
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:38,804
He says he's on the phone with someone
from the tip line who has information for us.

66
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:42,967
Right, then give Ukita the number for
line five and ask him to have the informant

67
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,358
call that line instead.

68
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:45,573
It'll be safer that way.

69
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,553
Mr. Matsuda, it's OK for you to turn on your cell
phone now. Actually, please turn it on right away.

70
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,900
Uh, sure.

71
00:04:56,891 --> 00:05:00,806
Yes, this is Suzuki, head of Kira's
investigation public information division.

72
00:05:01,987 --> 00:05:03,625
Raye Penber's fiancee?

73
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:05,828
Naomi Misora.

74
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:09,365
I've heard that name before.

75
00:05:11,564 --> 00:05:12,940
So it's her.

76
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:16,517
She's from the Los Angeles BB Murder Case. That's right.

77
00:05:17,035 --> 00:05:18,470
She was working under me.

78
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:22,252
I guess she must have come to Japan with her fiance.

79
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:30,256
Well, apparently she's been missing
since the day after her fiance died.

80
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:33,720
I'm sure that anyone in her
situation would be pretty depressed.

81
00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:34,857
Was it?

82
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,182
Suicide.

83
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:37,775
No.

84
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,000
The Naomi Misora I knew was strong.

85
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:42,706
Not to mention, she was also an excellent FBI agent.

86
00:05:42,977 --> 00:05:46,734
If anything, it's more likely
she'd be trying to catch Kira.

87
00:05:47,692 --> 00:05:50,042
It appears she came to Japan with Penber.

88
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:52,258
It's possible that she may have found a lead.

89
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:57,078
If that's the case, did Kira manage to get her first?

90
00:05:57,971 --> 00:06:00,571
Everyone, at this point I'd
like to focus our investigation

91
00:06:00,604 --> 00:06:02,925
on only those people who Raye Penber was tailing.

92
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:07,221
In particular, he was assigned to two police officers

93
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:08,821
and those closest to them.

94
00:06:09,107 --> 00:06:11,962
Very well, who are these two
individuals he was investigating?

95
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,234
Deputy Director Kitamura, along with...

96
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:19,934
Detective Superintendent Yagami and their families.

97
00:06:20,374 --> 00:06:25,925
At this stage, I'd like to place wiretaps
and surveillance cameras in both households.

98
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:29,659
I have to make sure there's no
evidence left on this computer,

99
00:06:29,684 --> 00:06:31,617
just in case someone goes through it.

100
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:37,728
Now I just have to hide these
clippings from the Death Note in here.

101
00:06:39,063 --> 00:06:42,013
It seems like you're pretty skilled with your hands.

102
00:06:42,054 --> 00:06:44,428
I bet you're pretty popular with the girls, aren't you?

103
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:46,439
Skill has nothing to do with it.

104
00:06:46,627 --> 00:06:48,316
It's your looks that count.

105
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:51,293
I'm guessing you're not that popular, are you?

106
00:06:51,602 --> 00:06:52,226
Huh?

107
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,225
Surveillance cameras?

108
00:06:54,256 --> 00:06:55,252
Ryuzaki.

109
00:06:55,277 --> 00:06:57,444
I don't see how you could even consider this.

110
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,094
If this got out, we'd have a
civil rights scandal on our hands.

111
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,452
We'd all lose our jobs.

112
00:07:01,477 --> 00:07:05,855
You told me you'd be willing to risk your lives for
this investigation, but you wouldn't risk your jobs?

113
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:10,467
Ryuzaki, what are the odds that
Kira's in one of those households?

114
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,475
Maybe 10%.

115
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,617
No, it's closer to 5%.

116
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:17,077
Seriously?

117
00:07:17,155 --> 00:07:18,685
I'm sorry, but it's not worth the risk.

118
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,227
No.

119
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:21,760
Of all the people we've investigated so far,

120
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:24,672
not one of them seemed even the least bit suspicious.

121
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,800
Even if there's only a 1% chance,

122
00:07:26,825 --> 00:07:28,608
we simply can't afford to ignore it.

123
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:29,364
Chief?

124
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,834
I don't have to tell you how offended I
am to learn my family is under suspicion.

125
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:37,056
Having said that, just go ahead with it.

126
00:07:37,446 --> 00:07:39,246
And make sure you install them everywhere.

127
00:07:39,313 --> 00:07:42,337
I don't want any blind spots in the
house, and that includes the bathroom.

128
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,837
Thank you very much.

129
00:07:44,862 --> 00:07:46,054
That was my intention.

130
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,512
Come on, Chief. You don't have to agree to this.

131
00:07:48,537 --> 00:07:49,467
Yes, he's right!

132
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:50,529
Think about your family.

133
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,611
You have a wife and daughter at home, don't you?

134
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:54,452
Yes, I'm well aware of that fact.

135
00:07:54,837 --> 00:07:57,708
But there is no point in doing
any of this if we can't be thorough.

136
00:07:57,733 --> 00:07:59,578
Now I suggest you keep quiet!

137
00:08:03,104 --> 00:08:03,975
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:04,263 --> 00:08:06,063
No, it's OK.

139
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:07,353
Excuse me.

140
00:08:09,776 --> 00:08:15,534
As a courtesy to the chief and his family, only
he and I will conduct surveillance of their home.

141
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,033
Watari, how long will it take to
prepare the wiretaps and cameras we need?

142
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:24,148
Well, starting tomorrow I can set them up at any time

143
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:26,653
provided we know when both houses will be empty.

144
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:31,087
See you later, Light.

145
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,028
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

146
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:37,325
What?

147
00:08:37,547 --> 00:08:38,739
No one's home yet.

148
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:48,591
I'm home.

149
00:08:58,379 --> 00:08:59,661
Huh?

150
00:09:00,313 --> 00:09:01,368
Hmm.

151
00:09:04,704 --> 00:09:05,761
How's it going?

152
00:09:05,786 --> 00:09:08,002
I don't think anyone else is in the house right now.

153
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:09,963
Do you want to play some video games?

154
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:13,506
Come on, it's been a while.

155
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:16,055
You listening?

156
00:09:20,654 --> 00:09:21,666
Hey, Light.

157
00:09:28,148 --> 00:09:29,781
I don't believe it.

158
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:32,325
I never knew he went to such great lengths.

159
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,756
What could he be hiding in there
that he doesn't want anyone else to see?

160
00:09:35,781 --> 00:09:40,269
For a 17 years old kid, I wouldn't say
this kind of behavior is particularly abnormal.

161
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,377
When I was his age, I did strange things, too.

162
00:09:43,623 --> 00:09:46,010
Have you ever talked to your son about the investigation?

163
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:46,882
Of course not.

164
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:50,033
I've never once revealed
classified information to my family.

165
00:09:50,613 --> 00:09:56,772
Besides, I don't get to see them too often these days.
And usually as soon as I get home, all I can do is sleep.

166
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,224
I understand.

167
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:01,333
Where exactly are we going?

168
00:10:03,596 --> 00:10:07,168
Light, don't ignore me when I'm
talking to you or I'll get mad.

169
00:10:07,813 --> 00:10:08,401
Huh?

170
00:10:09,096 --> 00:10:09,595
Hello?

171
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,766
It doesn't look like these clothes have been bugged.

172
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:12,875
I think we're safe.

173
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,117
Yoohoo.

174
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:15,058
Listen to me.

175
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,596
There's a very strong possibility
that there are wiretaps and maybe

176
00:10:18,621 --> 00:10:21,153
surveillance cameras hidden throughout my house.

177
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:21,975
Really?

178
00:10:22,181 --> 00:10:24,759
But that piece of paper was still in your door, wasn't it?

179
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:30,617
That's true, but I left the paper in the door in a
way that it would be obvious to anyone entering the room.

180
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:32,248
The real test is the handle.

181
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:33,423
It is?

182
00:10:33,448 --> 00:10:35,109
When that door is closed, the door handle

183
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,313
automatically returns to a horizontal position,

184
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:38,954
and it won't go any higher than that.

185
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:41,908
But whenever I close the door, I adjust it slightly.

186
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:43,661
Instead of letting it sit horizontally,

187
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,755
I lower it by about five millimeters.

188
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:48,362
When I get home and I try to open the door,

189
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:49,895
if the handle is all the way up,

190
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:51,950
I can be fairly certain that someone was in my room.

191
00:10:53,104 --> 00:10:56,111
But that method alone doesn't tell
me if my door was actually opened.

192
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:59,393
So I put a mechanical pencil lead in place, as well.

193
00:10:59,654 --> 00:11:01,308
So what you do with it?

194
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:02,714
It goes on the hinge.

195
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:04,124
After I close the door,

196
00:11:04,148 --> 00:11:06,152
I take the pencil lead and rest it on the hinge

197
00:11:06,177 --> 00:11:07,422
in such a way that it will break

198
00:11:07,446 --> 00:11:09,584
if the door happens to be opened by anyone.

199
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:12,267
Normally, I take it out myself when I get back home.

200
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:16,638
When I got home from school today, I
noticed that the pencil lead was broken.

201
00:11:16,754 --> 00:11:19,225
Now that you mention it, I do remember that.

202
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:23,394
First the door handle, then the
lead. I know someone was in there today.

203
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:25,267
Maybe it was your mother.

204
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,831
My family wouldn't have noticed the piece of paper.

205
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,741
What's suspicious is that someone
took the time to put it back in the door.

206
00:11:32,295 --> 00:11:33,978
Hi there, can I help you?

207
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,496
What's this all about?

208
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:39,634
Are you buying a book about wiretaps and
surveillance so you can figure this mess out?

209
00:11:41,404 --> 00:11:44,086
By the way, Ryuk, what about your apples?

210
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:45,654
Apples?

211
00:11:46,212 --> 00:11:47,065
Huh?

212
00:11:47,237 --> 00:11:49,554
That's right, surveillance cameras!

213
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:52,256
Once the apple's in my mouth, no one can see it.

214
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:54,981
But while I'm holding it, it looks like it's floating.

215
00:11:55,032 --> 00:11:56,118
I thought so.

216
00:11:56,196 --> 00:11:58,662
You told me that Shinigami can't die.

217
00:11:58,687 --> 00:12:01,650
So I guess it won't kill you to
stop eating apples for a while.

218
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,613
Uh, don't you think that's a bit much?

219
00:12:03,638 --> 00:12:04,263
Come on.

220
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:06,815
I never told you this, but apples are to me

221
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,300
what cigarettes and alcohol are to humans.

222
00:12:09,325 --> 00:12:10,740
Do you see what I'm saying?

223
00:12:10,765 --> 00:12:13,124
I even get withdrawal symptoms.

224
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:14,221
Oh yeah?

225
00:12:14,246 --> 00:12:15,546
What kind of symptoms?

226
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:17,854
My body gets all twisted. I do handstands.

227
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:18,950
It's not pretty!

228
00:12:18,975 --> 00:12:20,581
I don't need to see that.

229
00:12:20,637 --> 00:12:21,504
I know.

230
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:23,181
OK, here's the thing.

231
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,517
Unfortunately, I already gave L
the hint that Shinigami love apples.

232
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:28,346
So I just can't afford to take the risk.

233
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:29,946
When did you...

234
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:33,215
If it's so important for you to eat apples,

235
00:12:34,612 --> 00:12:37,545
you'll have to find out where all the cameras are hidden.

236
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,580
If you're lucky, you might find a blind
spot where you can eat them without being seen.

237
00:12:42,737 --> 00:12:44,477
All right, let's go.

238
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:46,840
Yeah, a camera search!

239
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:51,084
Sounds so interesting.

240
00:13:08,145 --> 00:13:09,667
Oh.

241
00:13:09,898 --> 00:13:13,708
Oh, uh, I have to find the cameras.

242
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,274
I can't believe my son is looking at those magazines.

243
00:13:17,887 --> 00:13:19,954
It's normal for a 17 years old.

244
00:13:20,644 --> 00:13:22,469
But it seems contrived.

245
00:13:22,494 --> 00:13:24,146
It's too obvious.

246
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:27,827
The only reason he didn't want anyone in
his room is because he had these magazines?

247
00:13:27,852 --> 00:13:29,340
That's what he wants us to think.

248
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:31,257
Hey, that's my son you're talking about.

249
00:13:31,663 --> 00:13:34,263
Are you honestly telling me that you suspect him?

250
00:13:34,288 --> 00:13:35,656
I do suspect him.

251
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,413
That's why I placed wiretaps and surveillance cameras

252
00:13:38,438 --> 00:13:40,585
in your house and the deputy director's house.

253
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:42,493
Huh?

254
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:44,888
I found a camera in the air conditioner.

255
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:45,834
Hmm.

256
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:48,344
So they really put cameras in here.

257
00:13:48,404 --> 00:13:50,552
They must have bugged the place, as well.

258
00:13:50,762 --> 00:13:54,919
Even if this is the Kira case, I didn't
think the Japanese police would ever go this far.

259
00:13:55,308 --> 00:13:56,863
This must be L's idea,

260
00:13:57,038 --> 00:13:59,584
which means they've narrowed down their list of suspects.

261
00:13:59,837 --> 00:14:03,131
By now they must have figured out that it
was someone who Raye Penber was investigating

262
00:14:03,156 --> 00:14:04,918
or they wouldn't have gone to all this trouble.

263
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,657
Man, these covers mislead you all the time.

264
00:14:12,546 --> 00:14:13,318
No.

265
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:16,335
Given the situation, it's safer if I just assume

266
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,577
I'm their prime suspect and the only one being watched.

267
00:14:19,763 --> 00:14:21,133
It'll be OK.

268
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:24,348
Luckily, I prepared for this kind of situation.

269
00:14:28,004 --> 00:14:29,321
Oh, Light.

270
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:31,618
Hey, Light.

271
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,760
Come on, dinner's ready.

272
00:14:36,423 --> 00:14:39,330
I love you always.

273
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:46,246
Hideki Ryuga!

274
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,005
I swear he's perfect!

275
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,496
How come no one in my class is like that?

276
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:53,117
Sayu, just eat your dinner.

277
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:54,585
I'll eat later.

278
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:56,294
Hello, Mr. Aizawa?

279
00:14:56,319 --> 00:14:58,727
Are the Kitamuras watching television now?

280
00:14:58,863 --> 00:14:59,763
Yes.

281
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:01,302
He's not home, but the other four

282
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:02,738
are watching while they eat dinner.

283
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,447
It's channel four.

284
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,863
Watari, please contact the broadcasters

285
00:15:07,888 --> 00:15:09,455
and tell them to play our message.

286
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,180
Very well.

287
00:15:10,205 --> 00:15:11,102
Understood.

288
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:14,721
Huh? What's this?

289
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,454
ICPO?

290
00:15:16,528 --> 00:15:18,800
They're saying that in response to the Kira murders,

291
00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:23,063
Interpol has decided to dispatch a
force of 1,500 investigators to Japan.

292
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:27,252
The investigators were drawn from the law
enforcement agencies of its member nations.

293
00:15:27,871 --> 00:15:29,965
1,500 investigators?

294
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:30,968
Woah.

295
00:15:31,717 --> 00:15:34,710
Chances are they've got cameras
in the living room, as well.

296
00:15:34,887 --> 00:15:37,160
Regardless of whether this news is real or not,

297
00:15:37,185 --> 00:15:40,103
it's obvious they're just
trying to evoke a reaction from me.

298
00:15:41,463 --> 00:15:44,162
This is the exact same trick he used last time.

299
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:46,988
The ICPO sure is stupid.

300
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,727
Huh?

301
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:50,657
I mean, there's no point in making this announcement.

302
00:15:51,054 --> 00:15:53,251
If they're going to send all
these people here to investigate,

303
00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:54,876
shouldn't they keep it a secret?

304
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:59,615
Even the FBI agents who were secretly
investigating were killed by Kira.

305
00:15:59,772 --> 00:16:01,213
Why would this be any different?

306
00:16:01,271 --> 00:16:04,659
If you ask me, this is nothing more
than a desperate attempt to shock Kira

307
00:16:04,684 --> 00:16:06,666
in the hopes that he'll reveal himself somehow.

308
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:09,952
Quite frankly, I wouldn't be surprised
if Kira sees right through this.

309
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,155
Hmm.

310
00:16:12,546 --> 00:16:14,683
Your son's clever, isn't he?

311
00:16:14,888 --> 00:16:15,650
Huh.

312
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,008
Well, yes.

313
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,505
Thanks for dinner, Mom.

314
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:19,749
Huh?

315
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:21,421
You're eating a bag of chips?

316
00:16:21,446 --> 00:16:22,547
You just had dinner.

317
00:16:22,572 --> 00:16:24,990
Your good looks are going to go
down the drain if you keep that up.

318
00:16:25,015 --> 00:16:27,140
It's a latenight snack for studying.

319
00:16:30,588 --> 00:16:32,055
I think that's it, Light.

320
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:34,900
I found every camera they put in the house.

321
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:38,083
I guess Shinigami get tired when they work hard.

322
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:40,609
Now let me explain where they all are.

323
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:43,396
It's a little bit complicated, so listen up.

324
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:46,788
There's nothing I hate more
than explaining something twice.

325
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:48,876
All right. It's time for me to hit the books.

326
00:16:49,646 --> 00:16:52,167
There sure are a lot of cameras in this room.

327
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:54,606
I counted 64 in total.

328
00:16:54,788 --> 00:16:58,646
I guess whoever put them here expected
you to at least find some of them.

329
00:16:58,746 --> 00:17:00,094
It has to be L.

330
00:17:00,246 --> 00:17:03,465
He had no qualms about putting
a death row inmate in his place

331
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,068
when he declared war on me.

332
00:17:05,197 --> 00:17:07,697
It's pretty clear he doesn't know any limits.

333
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:09,440
Ah, what I want to know is

334
00:17:09,465 --> 00:17:11,565
how am I going to be able to eat apples?

335
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,958
Obviously, that's impossible now, isn't it?

336
00:17:13,995 --> 00:17:16,641
Oh, yeah. I guess you can't talk in here.

337
00:17:17,221 --> 00:17:19,851
But we'd better discuss this outside tomorrow.

338
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:21,060
OK.

339
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:23,019
I think I'm getting the hang of this now.

340
00:17:23,513 --> 00:17:25,833
Judging by the number of cameras he's planted,

341
00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:28,959
he's planning to make a decision
within a short period of time.

342
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:32,212
Any normal person would slip under these circumstances.

343
00:17:32,338 --> 00:17:34,575
But it won't be that easy with me, L.

344
00:17:34,869 --> 00:17:37,557
This is the closest you get!

345
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:55,276
I've set things up so that criminals will
continue to die over the next three weeks.

346
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:59,477
L is aware by now that Kira can
control the times of death of his victims.

347
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:01,725
Therefore, to avoid suspicion...

348
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,692
he'll need to see the criminals
whose names are being broadcast

349
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:07,790
continue to die while I have
no access to that information.

350
00:18:08,548 --> 00:18:09,548
Oh!

351
00:18:09,573 --> 00:18:11,733
The symptoms are starting!

352
00:18:12,116 --> 00:18:14,427
I'm gonna show you, L.

353
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,300
With Ryuk's information and my preparations,

354
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:26,144
I can continue to kill criminals
whose names are broadcast on the news

355
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:29,057
while masquerading as a typical high school student

356
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:31,148
studying for his entrance exams.

357
00:18:31,965 --> 00:18:33,409
Just watch me, L.

358
00:18:33,465 --> 00:18:35,598
I'll solve equations with my right hand

359
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:37,878
and write names with my left.

360
00:18:39,546 --> 00:18:43,774
I'll take a potato chip and eat it!

361
00:18:54,469 --> 00:18:59,030
After dinner, your son just goes back to
studying without turning on the TV or his computer?

362
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:02,548
It's because the entrance exams are five days away.

363
00:19:12,182 --> 00:19:13,157
Now,

364
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:18,607
a criminal who I should have no knowledge
of will die of a heart attack in 40 seconds.

365
00:19:18,865 --> 00:19:22,999
And the witness to my alibi is L himself.

366
00:19:27,055 --> 00:19:27,956
All right.

367
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:29,650
Just a little bit longer.

368
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:36,148
Ryuzaki.

369
00:19:36,414 --> 00:19:37,832
Yes? What is it, Watari?

370
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:42,077
A few minutes ago, a bank clerk being
questioned on suspicion of embezzlement

371
00:19:42,102 --> 00:19:45,054
and a purse snatcher being held in a detention center

372
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,796
were broadcast on the news.

373
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:50,440
They both just died of sudden, inexplicable heart attacks.

374
00:19:50,971 --> 00:19:52,384
It's him again.

375
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:55,031
While all that was happening at your home,

376
00:19:55,056 --> 00:19:57,386
your wife and daughter were watching television.

377
00:19:57,873 --> 00:20:01,861
When that was over, they turned the TV
off and didn't want anything afterwards.

378
00:20:02,356 --> 00:20:07,204
From just about 7:30 until now, 11
o'clock, your son's done nothing but study.

379
00:20:07,382 --> 00:20:10,871
Kira needs a name and a face.
Without those, he can't kill.

380
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:15,176
So I suppose anyone who didn't
watch the news can't be Kira, right?

381
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:16,732
You said it yourself.

382
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,809
That means my family has been cleared.

383
00:20:18,923 --> 00:20:22,346
It doesn't make sense that Kira
would kill two petty criminals

384
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:24,589
right after their identities were broadcast.

385
00:20:26,023 --> 00:20:28,959
I know it's only the first day
after the cameras were installed,

386
00:20:28,984 --> 00:20:32,138
but the Yagami household seems almost too innocent to me.

387
00:20:32,324 --> 00:20:33,293
Hmm.

388
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,598
Light, are you up yet?

389
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:41,007
Yeah, I'm awake.

390
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:44,925
Today's garbage day, so if you've
got any, bring it down with you, OK?

391
00:20:45,772 --> 00:20:47,094
What a pain.

392
00:20:47,518 --> 00:20:49,325
What are you talking about?

393
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,355
You usually say, there's no need to remind me, Mom.

394
00:20:53,082 --> 00:20:54,528
Yeah, yeah.

395
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,698
Another beautiful day.

396
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:03,288
Well, I can't say for sure whether you are

397
00:21:03,313 --> 00:21:05,995
extremely generous or just a spoiled brat,

398
00:21:06,459 --> 00:21:10,298
but didn't that mini LCD TV cost you $400?

399
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:14,721
Good morning.

400
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:39,091
Perfect.

401
00:22:39,142 --> 00:22:41,091
There's no reason for me to be worried.

402
00:22:41,116 --> 00:22:44,406
After all, this is proof that
they don't have anything on me yet.

403
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:46,389
So this whole thing is nothing more than

404
00:22:46,414 --> 00:22:49,536
a contest between L and I, a battle of wits.
