1
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:28,217
Quiet, Matsuda.

2
00:01:28,242 --> 00:01:29,709
This is not the time to be fooling around.

3
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:30,402
Knock it off.

4
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:31,684
Yes, sir.

5
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,276
This is the Kira investigation.

6
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,571
Stop messing around!

7
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:35,908
Sorry, Aizawa.

8
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:39,383
Matsuda, please don't, Matsuda.

9
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:42,733
After all, the last thing I want is to be dead weight.

10
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:46,687
Ryuzaki, is there anything I can
do to help with the investigation,

11
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:48,136
besides the manager thing?

12
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:50,127
Could you get me another cup of coffee?

13
00:01:55,508 --> 00:01:56,656
I want to help, too.

14
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:59,012
I want to contribute to the case.

15
00:02:04,498 --> 00:02:05,998
I love you.

16
00:02:06,556 --> 00:02:09,974
So please, don't tell me you're going home now.

17
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:15,133
Instead, say you'll stay by my side.

18
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:18,379
Uh, Mr. Director, I can't do this.

19
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,352
I have a boyfriend. Can we cut the love scenes, please?

20
00:02:20,377 --> 00:02:21,265
Uhh...

21
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:22,139
Wait.

22
00:02:22,273 --> 00:02:23,681
Where'd this come from all of a sudden?

23
00:02:23,706 --> 00:02:25,529
Can't we just fake kiss or something?

24
00:02:25,554 --> 00:02:26,277
What?

25
00:02:26,752 --> 00:02:27,315
You're kidding.

26
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:28,848
You can't expect us to make a movie like that.

27
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:30,481
If I say no, then it's no.

28
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:31,054
OK?

29
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,232
Come on!

30
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:33,843
Come on.

31
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:35,590
Get rid of her. Fire her.

32
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,363
The Yotsuba Group's main Tokyo office.

33
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:42,767
And today is Friday.

34
00:02:44,181 --> 00:02:48,608
All the death that are beneficial for
Yotsuba are concentrated around the weekends.

35
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,917
Hmm.

36
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:52,810
The last thing I want to be is dead weight.

37
00:02:52,935 --> 00:02:55,148
Mogi's been incredibly efficient from the start.

38
00:02:55,196 --> 00:02:56,202
Quiet, Matsuda!

39
00:02:56,227 --> 00:02:57,458
This is not the time to be fooling around.

40
00:02:57,483 --> 00:02:58,554
Would you cut it out?

41
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,252
That is his specialty.

42
00:03:00,277 --> 00:03:02,122
And could you get me another cup of coffee?

43
00:03:02,147 --> 00:03:02,995
Matsuda!

44
00:03:11,072 --> 00:03:12,389
Matsu!

45
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,281
Hello, Matsu, get over here.

46
00:03:14,315 --> 00:03:16,200
I guess he had to run off somewhere.

47
00:03:16,347 --> 00:03:17,232
Oh.

48
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:26,824
Hmm.

49
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:37,816
All right.

50
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:40,533
For the time being, I want you
to start going over this list here.

51
00:03:40,558 --> 00:03:41,787
Yes, sir. Right away.

52
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:48,089
Would I punish evildoers and criminals if
I could kill by just seeing a name and face?

53
00:03:48,178 --> 00:03:50,716
Is that what I'd do if I had that sort of power?

54
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:55,536
I mean, it's true that there are lots of people
around that the world could frankly do without,

55
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:59,747
but I don't think I'd become a
murderer just to change the world.

56
00:04:00,258 --> 00:04:01,692
Surely I wouldn't do that.

57
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:03,450
No, I'm thinking too hard about this.

58
00:04:03,475 --> 00:04:07,089
There's no way anyone could murder so
many people and not have any memory of it.

59
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,451
What's wrong?

60
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:11,232
You've been staring at me for the last two minutes.

61
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,189
Wait, let me guess.

62
00:04:12,214 --> 00:04:14,793
You must be annoyed because I'm the
only one eating cake at the moment.

63
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:15,551
Am I right?

64
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:17,232
Uh, no, that's not it.

65
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:17,937
Here.

66
00:04:17,962 --> 00:04:19,403
Really, don't worry about it.

67
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:20,249
Hmm?

68
00:04:20,274 --> 00:04:21,174
Ryuzaki.

69
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:22,600
Yes, what is it?

70
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:28,606
Detective Eraldo Coil has just received a private
request to investigate and reveal the identity of L.

71
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,085
Isn't Eraldo Coil supposed to be the second
greatest detective in the world after L himself?

72
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:36,358
Who on earth would send such a request?

73
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:39,741
The man who sought out Coil's services is Masahiko Kida,

74
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:44,603
the head of the Rights and Planning Department
of the Yotsuba Group's headquarters in Tokyo.

75
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:45,941
So it is Yotsuba.

76
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:49,189
We know that Yotsuba must be linked to Kira.

77
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:51,299
If they're trying to find out L's identity,

78
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:54,566
it's probably because they want to kill
him and need that information to do it.

79
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:55,458
This isn't good.

80
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:59,531
We're already shorthanded enough as it
is, and now we have to worry about Coil, too.

81
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:02,474
Mm, mm. It's quite all right.

82
00:05:03,365 --> 00:05:06,003
The detective known as Eraldo Coil is me.

83
00:05:06,028 --> 00:05:06,578
Oh?

84
00:05:06,603 --> 00:05:08,099
It's quite simple, really.

85
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:10,026
Three of the greatest detectives in the world,

86
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:13,822
L, Coil, and Deneuve, they're all actually me.

87
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:18,452
It's been my experience that people
who try to find me usually fall for this.

88
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:23,159
I'll give you this strawberry if you keep it a secret, OK?

89
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:23,988
Mm.

90
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:26,649
I'm impressed as always, Ryuzaki.

91
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:43,549
Maybe I should leave while I still have a chance.

92
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,424
No, then there would have been no point in coming here.

93
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:49,891
Or should I wait until everyone's
gone and search their offices?

94
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,812
I can't. I'd probably get caught doing that, and then...

95
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:54,983
maybe I should get out of here.

96
00:05:56,158 --> 00:05:57,422
Not this again.

97
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,326
I'm too tired.

98
00:05:59,532 --> 00:06:02,424
Look on the bright side. At least it falls on the weekend.

99
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:05,603
We never know how long these
confidential meetings will go on far.

100
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:07,478
Can you imagine if we did this on Mondays?

101
00:06:07,503 --> 00:06:09,135
That would be the worst start to the week.

102
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,531
Confidential meetings?

103
00:06:10,724 --> 00:06:11,822
All right!

104
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,917
The 19th floor.

105
00:06:25,073 --> 00:06:26,335
I've made it this far.

106
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:27,749
I'm gonna see it through.

107
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,172
All right.

108
00:06:30,398 --> 00:06:32,281
I just have to get close to him, right?

109
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:33,623
Leave it to me.

110
00:06:33,822 --> 00:06:37,787
And you want me to make sure that
we're able to breach the security

111
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:41,237
and override the surveillance cameras
in the Yosuba Group's head office.

112
00:06:41,262 --> 00:06:42,545
Is that all?

113
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,474
Yes.

114
00:06:43,606 --> 00:06:48,061
At this point, it's safe to assume that Kira
and the Yotsuba Group are connected in some way.

115
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:52,216
We're going to investigate Yotsuba
to determine who holds Kira's power

116
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:55,390
and if there is more than one
person who possesses this ability.

117
00:06:55,603 --> 00:06:58,140
We need a clear understanding, quickly.

118
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:25,146
We cannot let anyone from Yotsuba
figure out that we are investigating them.

119
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:29,917
Please realize that if they do notice,
it means we won't be able to catch Kira.

120
00:07:31,248 --> 00:07:33,749
Damn it, I can't hear them clearly.

121
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:37,660
If only I could hear just one thing, something important.

122
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:45,156
Kill him.

123
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,819
I just heard someone say kill!

124
00:07:49,362 --> 00:07:50,561
I'm sure Kira would approve.

125
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:51,210
Kira!

126
00:07:51,356 --> 00:07:53,264
There it is. Kira, they said it!

127
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,143
What's that?

128
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:56,077
Let's have Kira get rid of him?

129
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:57,164
I heard it!

130
00:07:57,314 --> 00:07:58,814
They really are working with him.

131
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,050
I did it! This is huge!

132
00:08:10,143 --> 00:08:11,596
Who the hell are you?

133
00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:16,897
Please be sure not to act
impulsively out of panic or haste.

134
00:08:16,922 --> 00:08:19,483
And don't take matters into your own hands.

135
00:08:20,014 --> 00:08:21,014
Ryuzaki.

136
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:22,459
Yes, what is it?

137
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:26,639
I have just received an emergency
signal from Matsuda's belt.

138
00:08:27,528 --> 00:08:29,148
Oh, where is he?

139
00:08:29,353 --> 00:08:34,043
It seems that it's coming from within
the head office of the Yotsuba Group.

140
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:35,531
Uh, sorry to barge in like this.

141
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,418
Um, my name is Taro Matsui.

142
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:39,897
I'm an agent with Yoshida Productions.

143
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:43,976
I just dropped by to ask if your company would
be interested in using our top multi-talented star,

144
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:46,988
Misa Amane, as your new spokesperson...

145
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:48,932
Hmm.

146
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,624
Disregard everything I just said.

147
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,753
We'll need to rethink our strategy.

148
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:57,795
Matsuda, you idiot.

149
00:09:10,938 --> 00:09:14,320
Yoshida Productions, Taro Matsui.

150
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:18,447
He doesn't have anything suspicious on him.

151
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:21,542
I suppose that means he isn't a corporate spy.

152
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:23,251
Right.

153
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:26,374
Um, so please take Misa-Misa into consideration.

154
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,665
These two were only acting as guards.

155
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,022
The rest of them must be
discussing how they'll get rid of me.

156
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:36,109
Oh, there's no way out of this!

157
00:09:36,205 --> 00:09:37,838
I'm going to killed for sure.

158
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,583
I wonder if the emergency signal got through.

159
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,718
For never mind that.

160
00:09:41,743 --> 00:09:43,918
Even if it did, will Ryuzaki come and save me?

161
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:46,238
Oh no, what's gonna happen?

162
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:51,730
Go ahead.

163
00:09:51,755 --> 00:09:52,855
You can answer it.

164
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:54,816
Don't say that you're here, though.

165
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:56,822
And hold it away from your ear.

166
00:09:56,905 --> 00:09:59,339
Make sure we can listen in on the conversation.

167
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:00,672
OK.

168
00:10:02,697 --> 00:10:03,513
Hello?

169
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:06,264
Yo, Matsui!

170
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:08,207
Ryuzaki.

171
00:10:08,606 --> 00:10:09,405
Oh.

172
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:12,167
Uh, it's me, Asahi.

173
00:10:12,197 --> 00:10:13,486
It's been a while, buddy.

174
00:10:13,511 --> 00:10:15,645
Asahi! Yeah, it's been a long time.

175
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,957
Ha, it doesn't sound like you're out right now.

176
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:19,609
Don't tell me you're home already.

177
00:10:19,772 --> 00:10:20,799
Yeah.

178
00:10:20,824 --> 00:10:22,632
So, you by yourself?

179
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,790
Yeah, I'm by myself.

180
00:10:24,831 --> 00:10:25,764
What's up?

181
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:27,895
He's not with Misa Amane right now.

182
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,097
Matsuda must be on his own.

183
00:10:29,122 --> 00:10:29,844
Hmm.

184
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:32,984
So, do you want to, like, go out drinking tonight?

185
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:34,555
Huh? Right now?

186
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,361
Oh, sorry, I'll have to pass tonight.

187
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:38,936
Ah, what's the matter?

188
00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:41,726
Don't tell me your wallet is in trouble again.

189
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:42,491
In trouble.

190
00:10:42,988 --> 00:10:46,145
Yeah, that's right, big troubles with money.

191
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,868
You know me way too well.

192
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,463
Matsuda's saying he's in big trouble.

193
00:10:50,647 --> 00:10:52,257
Oh, that's too bad.

194
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:54,713
Guess I'll drag you out some other time, all right?

195
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:55,623
See you, buddy.

196
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:57,832
Uh.

197
00:11:01,271 --> 00:11:04,630
Aanyway, what do you think about contracting Misa-Misa?

198
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:07,295
I think she'd be great spokesperson for your company.

199
00:11:07,736 --> 00:11:08,720
Hmm.

200
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:13,553
If you're going to promote one of your clients,
shouldn't you at least bring them with you?

201
00:11:14,618 --> 00:11:17,218
Do you expect us to believe your this girl's manager?

202
00:11:17,696 --> 00:11:20,726
Well, to be honest, at the
moment, she's filming a movie nearby.

203
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:23,028
Once she's finished, I'll call her and get her over here.

204
00:11:23,053 --> 00:11:25,834
Then you can see why she'd make a great spokesperson.

205
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:28,611
I have to keep stalling them somehow.

206
00:11:30,305 --> 00:11:32,839
Misa's cell phone is on voicemail right now.

207
00:11:32,997 --> 00:11:36,016
I left her a message and told her
to get back to me as soon as she can.

208
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:38,512
What are you planning to do, Ryuzaki?

209
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:45,535
Well, we have to consider that if Matsuda dies, our
suspicions about the Yotsuba Group would be confirmed.

210
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:47,212
Hmm.

211
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:51,004
Let's just watch the situation for the time being.

212
00:11:52,272 --> 00:11:53,572
What should we do?

213
00:11:53,597 --> 00:11:56,090
The main question is whether he heard anything.

214
00:11:56,163 --> 00:11:58,472
If it's a possibility, no matter how small,

215
00:11:58,497 --> 00:11:59,631
we'll have to kill him.

216
00:11:59,656 --> 00:12:02,945
I'm wondering if he really did
come here just to promote his client.

217
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:05,538
He could be an undercover cop.

218
00:12:05,563 --> 00:12:07,230
No, that can't be it.

219
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:11,160
The Japanese police have completely
withdrawn support from the Kira case.

220
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,631
Look, it doesn't really matter who he is.

221
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:16,305
We have no choice but to kill him.

222
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:18,545
Hmm.

223
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,478
You know, now that I think about it,

224
00:12:22,503 --> 00:12:24,592
it might be good to have her as the face of our company.

225
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:25,084
Hmm?

226
00:12:25,322 --> 00:12:27,205
Ah, exactly.

227
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,495
Her shoot should be done soon, so please wait.

228
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,654
She'll convince you.

229
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:36,557
Mm, I'm beat.

230
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:41,834
I got a call from Light!

231
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:44,651
He really does worry about me when I'm late.

232
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,120
Misa?

233
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,384
Light! I'm sorry I've been working so much.

234
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:53,779
I'll be finished soon, 'kay?

235
00:12:54,604 --> 00:12:57,440
Misa, you're not with Matsuda at the moment, are you?

236
00:12:57,814 --> 00:12:59,551
Him? He's a total jerk.

237
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:01,397
He just ran off and left me here.

238
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:02,086
Oh.

239
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:05,128
Hang on. I'm getting a call on my work phone.

240
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:07,407
Oh hey, it's from Matsu.

241
00:13:07,546 --> 00:13:09,797
Misa's just received a call from Matsuda.

242
00:13:10,146 --> 00:13:12,904
Tell her to hold her phone so
that we can listen in as well.

243
00:13:14,313 --> 00:13:18,238
Misa-Misa, when you're finished filming,
come over to the Yotsuba Group head office.

244
00:13:18,554 --> 00:13:19,632
It's still tentative,

245
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:22,734
but there's a chance you may be able
to appear in Yotsuba's commercials.

246
00:13:22,788 --> 00:13:24,188
We're working it out now.

247
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:25,734
What? Are you for real?

248
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:27,142
You're amazing, Matsu!

249
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,278
So that's what you've been up to all this time!

250
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,276
Don't worry. We're wrapping up soon.

251
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,842
Great. It's just a short trip by taxi.

252
00:13:35,974 --> 00:13:36,573
Huh?

253
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,967
Listen to me, Light.

254
00:13:38,337 --> 00:13:40,937
There is a chance that we may be able to save Matsuda,

255
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:43,965
but we won't be able to do it without Misa's help.

256
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:46,841
She'll listen to you and do anything you say, won't she?

257
00:13:47,005 --> 00:13:47,722
Uh...

258
00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:51,305
I'm Misa-Misa.

259
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:55,403
My only rule is I don't do nudes, but
swimsuits and lingerie are totally OK.

260
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:57,662
It's really nice to meet you.

261
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:01,538
Hmm.

262
00:14:01,714 --> 00:14:04,209
I gotta admit, she is really cute in person.

263
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,430
That's not exactly the main issue now, wouldn't you agree?

264
00:14:07,455 --> 00:14:09,940
By the way, Matsu, since Yotsuba's a big catch,

265
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:12,665
I got the OK from our office to have a special reception.

266
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,240
Hmm?

267
00:14:13,615 --> 00:14:14,588
Reception?

268
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,380
Good evening.

269
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:19,747
We're very pleased to meet you.

270
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:24,177
Tonight, I'll be entertaining you as our
special guest, along with the girls from the agency.

271
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,678
Hey, is it just me, or is this getting weird?

272
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,616
Hmm. Well, it can't be helped.

273
00:14:30,313 --> 00:14:33,772
Right now, we can't afford to leave
Misa's manager alone for a second.

274
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:36,522
Let's just go with it. I'm going to enjoy myself.

275
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:38,657
All right.

276
00:14:38,682 --> 00:14:40,416
Hard to go wrong with this.

277
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:41,442
Hmm.

278
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,815
Ryuzaki and the others will be able to watch us from here.

279
00:14:45,988 --> 00:14:47,134
This is my way out.

280
00:14:50,288 --> 00:14:52,305
Here you are. Drink right up.

281
00:14:52,454 --> 00:14:54,505
Man, we gotta do this more often.

282
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,238
Hmm.

283
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:56,338
Well, well.

284
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,620
Misa's pretty good at this sort of thing.

285
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:06,343
Excuse me, guys.

286
00:15:08,364 --> 00:15:10,159
I gotta go to the bathroom.

287
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:16,380
Hmm.

288
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:21,919
Ryuzaki, are you watching this?

289
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:22,822
Yes.

290
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:24,532
L... Look, I'm really sorry that I...

291
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,214
That's not important right now.

292
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:27,002
OK.

293
00:15:27,196 --> 00:15:29,822
Listen, the eight men who came here
were having a meeting to determine

294
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,482
who they'd get Kira to kill for them.

295
00:15:31,507 --> 00:15:32,441
Oh?

296
00:15:32,663 --> 00:15:34,002
I heard them say it clearly.

297
00:15:34,238 --> 00:15:36,166
There's no doubt they're behind this.

298
00:15:36,264 --> 00:15:38,197
Yes, that is probably true.

299
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:42,837
But if you did overhear them, and they caught you,
then they'll almost certainly be trying to kill you now.

300
00:15:43,813 --> 00:15:44,703
I know.

301
00:15:45,305 --> 00:15:47,872
Do you think there's anything I can do to save myself?

302
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,353
Well, luckily, you're still
alive, so we may be able to save you.

303
00:15:51,378 --> 00:15:52,766
But for that to happen,

304
00:15:52,905 --> 00:15:55,245
you will have to die before they can kill you.

305
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:56,245
What?

306
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:59,359
I want you to listen to me very carefully.

307
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,897
No way.

308
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,558
But that's... that's crazy.

309
00:16:17,863 --> 00:16:20,332
And you know our company is expanding.

310
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:26,914
Hey!

311
00:16:27,038 --> 00:16:28,098
What the hell?

312
00:16:28,123 --> 00:16:28,937
Who's that?

313
00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:34,349
Wow, I am so drunk.

314
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:38,046
Huh?

315
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:40,792
Oh, h... hi, everyone.

316
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,642
Everyone having fun? Good.

317
00:16:42,763 --> 00:16:43,996
That's great.

318
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:48,355
Now, everyone, the moment you've all been waiting for,

319
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,192
the Taro Matsui show!

320
00:16:54,322 --> 00:16:55,728
Hey, what are you doing?

321
00:16:56,789 --> 00:16:58,090
Yay!

322
00:16:58,115 --> 00:17:00,093
You can do it! Go Matsu!

323
00:17:00,146 --> 00:17:02,500
All right, here we go.

324
00:17:04,855 --> 00:17:05,736
Uh...

325
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:08,417
Hey, you're drunk. That's way too dangerous.

326
00:17:08,442 --> 00:17:10,211
Don't worry. I'm just fine.

327
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:11,640
I do this all the time.

328
00:17:17,864 --> 00:17:19,255
What the hell are you doing?

329
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:20,397
Get in here!

330
00:17:20,422 --> 00:17:20,980
Stop!

331
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:22,332
Are you crazy, you idiot?

332
00:17:22,357 --> 00:17:24,791
It's all right.  No prob.

333
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:44,330
He fell!

334
00:17:47,138 --> 00:17:48,317
This can't be good.

335
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:50,471
Ah, no!

336
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,196
I heard a thud, so I came out.

337
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,440
This is just horrible.

338
00:17:53,465 --> 00:17:54,196
Someone call an ambulance!

339
00:17:54,221 --> 00:17:57,027
Geez. This sure is a crappy role.

340
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:00,957
Look, everyone, I think you should all just
leave this for us to take care of and go home.

341
00:18:00,982 --> 00:18:01,574
What?

342
00:18:02,006 --> 00:18:02,539
But...

343
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:03,770
Don't worry. We'll handle it.

344
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:06,163
Just don't forget about me for your next campaign, OK?

345
00:18:06,188 --> 00:18:06,926
Let's go.

346
00:18:06,951 --> 00:18:09,032
If the press sees us, we're in trouble.

347
00:18:10,011 --> 00:18:10,644
Yeah.

348
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:15,563
What's going on?

349
00:18:15,604 --> 00:18:16,765
Did someone jump?

350
00:18:18,536 --> 00:18:21,988
Well, we're lucky that he ended up
dying right in front of us, at any rate.

351
00:18:22,162 --> 00:18:22,570
Hey.

352
00:18:22,595 --> 00:18:23,228
Huh?

353
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,678
Mm.

354
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:34,828
While I'm aware of the fact that we're shorthanded,

355
00:18:34,853 --> 00:18:38,020
I'm not very pleased about having
to do this sort of thing myself.

356
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:40,419
Matsuda, you idiot.

357
00:18:55,505 --> 00:18:58,747
"Misa Amane's manager dies in fall."

358
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:00,280
Hmm.

359
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:06,905
Yes.

360
00:19:07,205 --> 00:19:08,705
You're Masahiko Kida,

361
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:12,830
VP of the Rights and Planning Department
at Yotsuba's Tokyo office, correct?

362
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:15,513
Yes, that's right. And who am I speaking to?

363
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,767
I go by the name Eraldo Coil.

364
00:19:18,888 --> 00:19:21,465
I'm calling to discuss my terms with you.

365
00:19:22,265 --> 00:19:23,107
What?

366
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:26,532
A $2 million advance and $8 million upon completion?

367
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:27,979
Is he out of his mind?

368
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:28,836
That's not all.

369
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:32,836
Even if we don't commission him, we have to
pay him $2 million just to keep him silent.

370
00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:34,890
So he wants hush money, huh?

371
00:19:35,713 --> 00:19:39,918
If he's saying something like that, we
should assume Coil knows quite a bit already.

372
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:42,607
This it's getting ridiculous.

373
00:19:42,632 --> 00:19:45,407
I've had it. I want out of these meetings right now.

374
00:19:45,432 --> 00:19:47,476
I don't know who Kira is, and I don't care.

375
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:50,626
I just don't want to get wrapped
up in this and end up in jail!

376
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:51,351
No.

377
00:19:51,376 --> 00:19:52,217
Huh?

378
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:56,447
Hatori, I think you are going to end up dead tomorrow.

379
00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:07,587
No, wait. I was only joking. It's not like that.

380
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,339
I'm in. I'll see this to the end.

381
00:20:11,364 --> 00:20:12,871
So what are we going to do?

382
00:20:13,043 --> 00:20:16,863
Coil is still willing to accept the
job, despite what he already knows.

383
00:20:16,888 --> 00:20:17,762
Isn't it obvious?

384
00:20:17,787 --> 00:20:20,391
He'll become partners with us, as long as we pay him.

385
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:24,579
His demand are exorbitant, but we need to
have someone as skilled as Coil on our side.

386
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:26,100
Good point. Pay him.

387
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:27,882
It doesn't matter how much.

388
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:29,997
Exactly. We'll just have to pay him.

389
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:31,205
Uh?

390
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:43,512
All right, we'll contract Coil.

391
00:20:43,605 --> 00:20:45,547
Anyone have any objections?

392
00:20:45,572 --> 00:20:47,481
No objections.

393
00:20:49,022 --> 00:20:50,488
L, are you listening?

394
00:20:50,993 --> 00:20:52,132
I am To disappointed.

395
00:20:52,157 --> 00:20:53,787
I thought this would be a challenge.

396
00:20:53,822 --> 00:20:55,989
Security level here is a joke.

397
00:20:56,014 --> 00:20:58,573
They've left it all to a single contractor.

398
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:01,818
There weren't even any wiretap detectors.

399
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:05,012
It's been about a week since I first snuck into the place.

400
00:21:05,037 --> 00:21:08,414
It looks like things have been
moving pretty smoothly since then, huh?

401
00:21:08,638 --> 00:21:09,837
We've almost got them.

402
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,422
So one of these people...

403
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:15,846
mm... mm... is Kira.

404
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:16,741
Well, then.

405
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:19,230
Now that everyone's here, let's
commence our regular meeting.

406
00:21:19,255 --> 00:21:23,105
But if there's supposed to be
eight, why are there only seven?

407
00:22:37,251 --> 00:22:41,791
Ryuzaki, you think I'm capable of becoming a murderer?

408
00:22:41,997 --> 00:22:42,999
Kira?

409
00:22:43,164 --> 00:22:45,260
Even after I helped you catch him?

410
00:22:45,356 --> 00:22:48,922
Do I seem like that kind of person to you?
