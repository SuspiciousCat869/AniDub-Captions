1
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,043
Delete.

2
00:01:31,339 --> 00:01:32,587
Delete!

3
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:34,508
Delete!

4
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:44,973
The average Japanese adult would say that.

5
00:01:44,998 --> 00:01:48,408
Teru Mikami was a child with a strong sense of justice.

6
00:01:48,752 --> 00:01:50,962
He was able to distinguish right from wrong

7
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:52,606
better than any of his peers.

8
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:55,650
And compared to the average Japanese person,

9
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:58,851
Teru had been through and seen far worse miseries,

10
00:01:58,876 --> 00:02:00,282
and even witnessed death.

11
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:52,401
His hat.

12
00:02:53,492 --> 00:02:54,179
Get it.

13
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:59,193
In this world, there is only good and evil.

14
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:04,920
That was one of the first universal truths I grasped
from observing the world around me when I was a child.

15
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:10,374
Every human being, without exception, ends
up falling into one category or the other.

16
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:15,459
Even those in innocent years of elementary school,

17
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,768
one could not escape that fact.

18
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:22,016
As class president, I strived to achieve
great things for my fellow students,

19
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:24,294
but there were always enemies.

20
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:25,995
Good against evil.

21
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:30,860
No! Stop! Let go of me, please!

22
00:03:33,585 --> 00:03:35,165
Evil has to be confronted.

23
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,423
What do you want, nerd?

24
00:03:40,274 --> 00:03:43,694
There were times when it seemed
evil would triumph over good.

25
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:46,562
But no matter what happened to me,

26
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:48,863
I felt happy for one reason.

27
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:51,170
Thank you, Teru.

28
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:55,576
Hearing those words of gratitude from the victims

29
00:03:55,623 --> 00:03:58,230
made me want to save them again and again.

30
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:02,757
For that reason, I never spared any effort.

31
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:04,602
And in the end,

32
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:08,047
I was able to stand up for my sense of justice.

33
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,302
Does this bug you?

34
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:25,679
But that was only true in the world of children.

35
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:33,872
Middle school was another matter entirely.

36
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:38,820
The more I confronted evil,
the more enemies I had to face.

37
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,934
Victims would become participants,

38
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,839
and even the people watching would be influenced by evil

39
00:04:45,864 --> 00:04:47,966
and become enemies themselves.

40
00:04:50,896 --> 00:04:54,446
But for justice to triumph, it requires action.

41
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:59,161
So I realized, to serve justice, I had to delete evil.

42
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,240
The only person who understood
my hopes and remained my ally

43
00:05:04,265 --> 00:05:06,720
was the woman who raised me on her own.

44
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,257
My mother.

45
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:09,368
No.

46
00:05:09,785 --> 00:05:12,125
Rather, it used to be my mother.

47
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:19,795
Teru, not everything in the world is
going to work the way you want it to.

48
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,406
You have to stop doing this.

49
00:05:22,431 --> 00:05:25,224
There's no reason for you to
suffer so much for your beliefs.

50
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,036
What do you think you're proving getting hurt like this?

51
00:05:28,785 --> 00:05:30,600
This is plain foolishness.

52
00:05:30,718 --> 00:05:32,762
You have to realize that somethings never change...

53
00:05:32,818 --> 00:05:34,540
My mother was wrong.

54
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,689
She didn't side with justice.

55
00:05:37,651 --> 00:05:40,528
She was one of those who deserved to be deleted.

56
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:43,703
That was when the miracle happened.

57
00:05:47,043 --> 00:05:49,140
Four of the worst delinquents from my school

58
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:51,707
lost control of their car while they were joyriding.

59
00:05:52,262 --> 00:05:53,423
They died instantly.

60
00:05:53,673 --> 00:05:55,911
One bystander was killed as well.

61
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:58,844
That bystander was my mother.

62
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:04,229
In one fell swoop, all the
people I resented had been deleted.

63
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:06,609
At first, I was terrified.

64
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:08,270
I couldn't stop shivering.

65
00:06:09,496 --> 00:06:11,438
But then it hit me.

66
00:06:11,884 --> 00:06:13,718
With these people out of the picture,

67
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:16,090
how many others would benefit as a result?

68
00:06:16,574 --> 00:06:18,374
Clearly their victims were relieved.

69
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,641
But beyond that.

70
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,935
Wouldn't everyone in my class be
happier now that they were gone?

71
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:26,168
And sure enough, I was right.

72
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,376
Our classroom became a peaceful, joyful place.

73
00:06:31,718 --> 00:06:34,607
There will always the consequences for evil deeds.

74
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:36,300
That is the way the world is.

75
00:06:36,873 --> 00:06:38,007
The way it should be.

76
00:06:40,862 --> 00:06:42,976
Evil must be deleted.

77
00:06:44,496 --> 00:06:46,095
Now then, let's see.

78
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,325
Are there any more problems with these records?

79
00:06:48,372 --> 00:06:49,016
No, they're fine.

80
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,320
With every passing year,

81
00:06:50,345 --> 00:06:53,108
my commitment to justice only grew stronger.

82
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:57,448
I saw that there will always be
those who have no reason to exist.

83
00:06:57,763 --> 00:07:01,481
Those whose very existence is a threat to society.

84
00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:03,971
And the closer they grew to adulthood,

85
00:07:04,163 --> 00:07:06,736
the less likely was that they would ever reform.

86
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:09,895
They could only be deleted.

87
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:18,429
Mysteriously, every time I judged someone as evil,

88
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,623
they would soon be taken care of.

89
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:22,420
Was it coincidence?

90
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:24,130
Was I special somehow?

91
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:27,352
In the end, it didn't matter.

92
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:30,277
Divine judgment must be brought up evil.

93
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:35,269
And if it isn't, then someone must
take it upon themselves to punish evil.

94
00:07:36,362 --> 00:07:38,562
That's why I became a prosecutor.

95
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:42,317
It is the role of the prosecutor to
see that evil is brought to justice.

96
00:07:42,552 --> 00:07:44,298
It was an ideal job for me.

97
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:47,162
And then...

98
00:07:49,107 --> 00:07:50,712
God came before me.

99
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:53,506
Everything that had been happening around me

100
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,048
wasn't coincidence.

101
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:57,903
It was divine justice.

102
00:07:59,673 --> 00:08:02,510
God had been watching me.

103
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,211
God had seen how I did not surrender to evil.

104
00:08:08,496 --> 00:08:12,272
He reached out his hand and
punished the evil people for me.

105
00:08:12,473 --> 00:08:17,147
Once I realized that, I started to frequent
places where God was bound to be watching.

106
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,900
And then it happened.

107
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:27,284
God recognized me as I had always hoped!

108
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:31,770
Not only that, but he found me worthy
of sharing his power to eliminate evil!

109
00:08:35,485 --> 00:08:38,327
With this, it doesn't matter if I can't hear his voice.

110
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:42,095
I shall figure out what Kira wants and carry out his will.

111
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,796
Delete.

112
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:45,344
Delete.

113
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,522
Delete.

114
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,641
Delete.

115
00:08:48,174 --> 00:08:49,090
Delete.

116
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:49,852
Delete.

117
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:50,940
Delete.

118
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:52,064
Delete.

119
00:08:52,651 --> 00:08:53,697
Delete.

120
00:08:54,095 --> 00:08:55,384
Delete.

121
00:08:57,595 --> 00:08:58,536
Delete.

122
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:12,687
Mikami made the choice to kill Demegawa himself.

123
00:09:12,712 --> 00:09:14,146
I never requested it.

124
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:17,189
An understandable move, but now there's no spokesperson.

125
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:18,906
Kira needs a voice.

126
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:22,031
At the moment, I can't make any moves myself.

127
00:09:22,254 --> 00:09:23,779
What will he do?

128
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:26,041
Kira isn't saying anything.

129
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:28,903
He must be in a situation where he can't move freely.

130
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,015
But this is an important time for him.

131
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:34,332
We need a spokesperson to spread his word to the people.

132
00:09:35,153 --> 00:09:36,964
Then I will take the initiative.

133
00:09:39,321 --> 00:09:40,907
Extra, extra!

134
00:09:40,932 --> 00:09:42,965
There's a new development in the Kira case.

135
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,107
He's chosen a new spokesperson to take Demegawa's place.

136
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:46,924
Take a look.

137
00:09:51,432 --> 00:09:52,610
That woman.

138
00:09:56,332 --> 00:09:58,093
Kiyomi Takada.

139
00:09:58,118 --> 00:09:59,024
Good evening.

140
00:09:59,476 --> 00:10:01,921
This is Kiyomi Takada from News 6.

141
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:05,209
Starting today, it will be my
duty to spread the word of Kira

142
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:06,635
accurately and quickly.

143
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,360
From now on, NHN will fairly...

144
00:10:08,385 --> 00:10:11,271
So he picked NHN's star newscaster, huh?

145
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,408
Kira's got good taste.

146
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:15,514
Choosing Taki was a good idea.

147
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,537
There's no mistaking it.

148
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:20,687
That's the girl that Light dated in university.

149
00:10:20,712 --> 00:10:22,936
...but also his liaison with the people of the world.

150
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:24,784
You've moved quickly, Mikami.

151
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:29,886
However, it won't take them long to find the
connection between us, which could be a problem.

152
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:32,785
No. On second thought, she's not a bad choice.

153
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,699
It's one I never would have
considered, since I already knew her.

154
00:10:35,865 --> 00:10:38,180
But this could actually make things easier.

155
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:39,947
I can definitely use her,

156
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,275
but I'll have to find a way to contact her soon.

157
00:10:43,954 --> 00:10:45,175
Kiyomi Takada.

158
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:49,284
I had a chance to meet her when I was
part of a debate program she was hosting.

159
00:10:49,998 --> 00:10:52,525
She was a shrewd and fair host for the most part,

160
00:10:52,843 --> 00:10:56,001
but her attitude changed suddenly
when Kira's name was mentioned.

161
00:10:56,232 --> 00:10:59,843
She had a uniquely rigid sense of
justice that I could identify with.

162
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:02,805
She hates crimes and social evils with a passion.

163
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,950
I talked with her privately several times after that.

164
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,971
She clearly supports Kira.

165
00:11:08,454 --> 00:11:10,000
But it's more than that.

166
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:11,608
She thinks like Kira.

167
00:11:12,554 --> 00:11:16,897
That makes her the broadcaster most
worthy of being the new voice of Kira.

168
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:23,732
Kiyomi Takada.

169
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:28,115
It'd to be too suspicious for Kira to
choose an ex-girlfriend as his representative.

170
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,243
And there's been no sign of
Light sending her any messages.

171
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:34,129
Maybe I'm thinking about this too much.

172
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:38,343
Everyone, I just had an idea.

173
00:11:38,423 --> 00:11:41,321
I was thinking we could make use of Kiyomi Takada.

174
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:43,314
To be honest, I know her.

175
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:46,820
Back in university, she and I were
actually dating for a little while.

176
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:47,699
Whoa.

177
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:49,043
So he admits it.

178
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,405
He has no intention to hide the connection.

179
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,538
If she's acting as his spokesperson,

180
00:11:53,563 --> 00:11:55,600
she must be receiving orders from him.

181
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:57,966
She's in contact with Kira somehow.

182
00:11:57,991 --> 00:12:01,711
I think our best bet is to use that
connection to find a way to Kira through her.

183
00:12:02,565 --> 00:12:05,390
But Taki's probably doing it
because Kira's threatening her, right?

184
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:07,878
She might be too scared to help
us out with her investigation.

185
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:09,598
That's a good point.

186
00:12:09,943 --> 00:12:11,607
I'm not too worried about that.

187
00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:16,380
I know her current cell phone number. I'm pretty sure
that I'll be able to convince her once we get talking.

188
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:18,515
She'll meet with me if I ask her to.

189
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,104
Ha ha. Wow.

190
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:21,453
Listen to this guy.

191
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:22,820
You're the man, Light.

192
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:28,159
Talking to her will be easy, but the real challenge
will be to get her to help us find and arrest Kira.

193
00:12:28,496 --> 00:12:32,742
We used to talk about a lot of different topics
while we were in college, and one thing was clear.

194
00:12:33,565 --> 00:12:35,157
She worships Kira.

195
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,719
But we might be able to use that to our advantage.

196
00:12:40,987 --> 00:12:43,068
The police claim they support Kira,

197
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:45,385
but aren't doing anything one way or the other.

198
00:12:45,622 --> 00:12:49,837
So I'll reveal that I've joined the police,
and ask her what we can do to help Kira further.

199
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:52,303
To her, it'll sound like a good idea.

200
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:57,009
We can convince her to assist us as
long as we pretend it's for Kira's benefit.

201
00:12:57,854 --> 00:12:59,771
Do you think that'll go over well?

202
00:12:59,854 --> 00:13:02,520
I'm not entirely sure. But it's worth a try, at least.

203
00:13:02,671 --> 00:13:03,568
I agree.

204
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:06,690
It'd be foolish for us to pass up a lead like this.

205
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:08,799
In that case, I'll call her tonight.

206
00:13:08,965 --> 00:13:09,843
Light.

207
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:14,046
If you don't mind, I'd like to listen
in on your conversation with Ms. Takada.

208
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:14,968
Of course.

209
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:16,064
That's fine with me.

210
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:17,832
Actually, it's better if you do.

211
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:21,851
If she lets slip something about Kira, it
would be best if more than one of us was listening.

212
00:13:22,364 --> 00:13:23,924
Uh, yeah.

213
00:13:32,643 --> 00:13:33,636
Yes, Hello?

214
00:13:33,698 --> 00:13:35,894
Kiyomi? This is Light Yagami.

215
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:36,565
Light?

216
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:39,917
Hi. It's been a while. What's going on?

217
00:13:39,942 --> 00:13:43,085
Kiyomi, I have something important to tell you.

218
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:44,925
Could we meet somewhere?

219
00:13:45,265 --> 00:13:46,965
I have a favor to ask you.

220
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,049
A favor?

221
00:13:48,654 --> 00:13:49,487
Yeah.

222
00:13:49,943 --> 00:13:52,118
I know my timing is pretty bad, I mean,

223
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:54,604
you're the woman the whole world is watching right now,

224
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:56,186
so it might not be possible.

225
00:13:57,054 --> 00:13:59,189
Don't play innocent and humble with me, Light.

226
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:02,231
You wouldn't have called if you
didn't think it was possible to see me.

227
00:14:03,154 --> 00:14:04,199
You're right.

228
00:14:05,265 --> 00:14:06,918
Ever since we graduated,

229
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,718
I wanted to talk to you again, but I never had the chance.

230
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,204
And now it looks like our jobs have brought us together.

231
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:16,112
After so much time, our paths are about to cross again.

232
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:18,599
Call me crazy, but I feel like this is fate.

233
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:21,967
What do you mean, our jobs?

234
00:14:21,992 --> 00:14:23,626
I'm working with the police now.

235
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:25,895
That was part of what I wanted to talk to you about.

236
00:14:26,022 --> 00:14:27,157
In person.

237
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:30,735
The police aren't doing anything
to defy Kira at this point.

238
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:33,095
All right.

239
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:36,235
I may be able to help you,
depending on what you're asking for.

240
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,433
I appreciate it.

241
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:41,235
At the very least, I just want
you to hear what I have to say.

242
00:14:41,332 --> 00:14:42,228
Anywhere.

243
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:43,942
Just us two.

244
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:47,936
Well, OK then.

245
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:50,272
After tonight's broadcast is finished.

246
00:14:50,798 --> 00:14:52,192
That sounds perfect.

247
00:14:52,354 --> 00:14:53,929
I'll book a hotel room for us.

248
00:14:54,532 --> 00:14:55,732
A hotel room?

249
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:56,786
Are you sure?

250
00:14:57,477 --> 00:15:00,270
The last I heard, you were still living with Miss Amane.

251
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:03,737
Are things not going to well on the home front?

252
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:05,737
Well, to be honest,

253
00:15:06,421 --> 00:15:10,437
Misa's just not intelligent enough to be my partner.

254
00:15:11,254 --> 00:15:12,341
Motchi.

255
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:13,297
Yes?

256
00:15:13,322 --> 00:15:14,960
Your cooking is really good.

257
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:17,319
And I appreciate that you're doing everything for me,

258
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:18,906
but it's been five days now.

259
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:19,528
Right.

260
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:22,667
Light doesn't know about you
hanging around all the time, does he?

261
00:15:22,692 --> 00:15:25,465
I'm beginning to get a really
bad feeling about this whole thing.

262
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,199
Uhhuh.

263
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:28,338
I mean, I know that Light trusts me totally,

264
00:15:28,363 --> 00:15:31,402
but don't you think most people
would start saying I'm cheating on him?

265
00:15:31,427 --> 00:15:33,448
Oh, he'd be so jealous.

266
00:15:34,465 --> 00:15:37,989
Near and the others told me that this
woman is supposed to be the second Kira.

267
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:41,412
But it could really be this unbelievably stupid girl?

268
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:47,858
It seems that Kira still hasn't tried to contact me yet.

269
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:52,098
If he's in a situation where he's
unable to contact me even if he wants to,

270
00:15:52,488 --> 00:15:56,206
then the next best thing would be
for him to contact Takada instead.

271
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,500
Good evening, this is the 9:00 news.

272
00:16:01,975 --> 00:16:04,788
First, I have an announcement
that comes directly from Kira.

273
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:07,280
His words are to become the new law of the world.

274
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:11,290
Kira will never forgive those people
whose existence is a threat to justice.

275
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:15,935
But he will also not forgive those who live
wastefully, and refuse to use their abilities

276
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,440
to contribute to the betterment of society.

277
00:16:18,498 --> 00:16:19,290
What?

278
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,840
So Kira's going to kill lazy people now?

279
00:16:21,865 --> 00:16:23,199
You're kidding me.

280
00:16:23,224 --> 00:16:25,391
You're taking this too far, Mikami.

281
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,749
It's too early to be making those kinds of statements.

282
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:29,610
I've got to get a hold of him soon.

283
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,621
Matsuda, how is it?

284
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:33,575
Good.

285
00:16:33,732 --> 00:16:36,201
Audio and video online, no blind spots.

286
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:37,476
Until next time...

287
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:39,058
The 9:00 news is just saying.

288
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,854
Everything's in order. I'll head back to HQ.

289
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:42,575
OK.

290
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,919
I missed you.

291
00:17:20,488 --> 00:17:21,499
Huh?

292
00:17:23,265 --> 00:17:27,435
Um, I'm sorry. It's just anyway, please, sit down.

293
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:31,122
To be honest,

294
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:34,418
it doesn't seem like that long
since we last saw each other.

295
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,538
What the hell is Light doing?

296
00:17:49,563 --> 00:17:51,051
He's not saying anything.

297
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:53,468
If he just stays silent, she'll get suspicious.

298
00:17:53,598 --> 00:17:54,668
Come on.

299
00:17:54,921 --> 00:17:56,993
Don't tell me you've never been in love before, Ide.

300
00:17:57,018 --> 00:17:57,638
What?

301
00:17:57,977 --> 00:17:58,602
How's it going?

302
00:17:58,627 --> 00:17:59,860
The mood's perfect.

303
00:17:59,899 --> 00:18:01,457
That's not what I meant.

304
00:18:02,043 --> 00:18:02,675
Huh?

305
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,901
Please excuse me.

306
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,989
Kira.

307
00:18:11,643 --> 00:18:13,155
Is it Mikami?

308
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,861
She just said it's Kira.

309
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:16,812
Kira's contacting her directly?

310
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:19,056
You should answer it.

311
00:18:19,121 --> 00:18:20,417
Um, right.

312
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:21,613
Hello.

313
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:24,063
No, I'm with a friend right now.

314
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:26,073
Yes, we're alone.

315
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:29,717
If luck is on my side, I can get on the phone myself.

316
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,308
Well, Mikami, can you make it happen?

317
00:18:32,506 --> 00:18:34,593
He wanted to meet me all of a sudden.

318
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:38,669
Someone who requests a private
meeting with Kira's spokesperson.

319
00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:41,324
I'd like to speak with him, if I may.

320
00:18:44,065 --> 00:18:45,683
He said the he wants to speak to you.

321
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,271
Perfect.

322
00:18:47,402 --> 00:18:49,559
I was right to choose you, Mikami.

323
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:53,192
She's passed the phone to Light.

324
00:18:53,343 --> 00:18:55,326
It could be dangerous if he's the real thing.

325
00:18:55,899 --> 00:18:56,981
Yes? Hello?

326
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,385
Who am I speaking to?

327
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:02,983
Five pages on November 26th?

328
00:19:03,165 --> 00:19:05,043
I don't get it. What do you mean?

329
00:19:07,117 --> 00:19:08,173
You're God!

330
00:19:08,598 --> 00:19:10,353
You're doing well, Mikami.

331
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,573
Let's just see how much you can figure out.

332
00:19:12,788 --> 00:19:15,288
Got it. You're not free to speak right now.

333
00:19:15,498 --> 00:19:16,305
Yes.

334
00:19:16,332 --> 00:19:17,953
You're being watched at the moment.

335
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:18,886
Yes.

336
00:19:18,988 --> 00:19:21,525
But how can I trust you're the real Kira?

337
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:24,153
Is he asking me to judge someone right now?

338
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,695
Turn to Sakura TV!

339
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,562
What's that?

340
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,217
Sakura TV?

341
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,755
Quick. Let's check it out.

342
00:19:30,332 --> 00:19:32,662
We'll invite Kira back to our program

343
00:19:32,687 --> 00:19:34,732
no matter what it might take...

344
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:36,841
He died!

345
00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:38,863
This is bad. He's the real thing.

346
00:19:38,932 --> 00:19:42,290
Mikami. You're even better than I expected.

347
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:46,298
What? He's removing the bugs?

348
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:48,690
We don't have a choice.

349
00:19:52,008 --> 00:19:54,193
I don't understand. What's going on?

350
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:56,821
Now I can talk without any constraints.

351
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,777
What?

352
00:19:58,787 --> 00:20:00,148
Listen, Kiyomi.

353
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,481
I am the real Kira.

354
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,048
That's right. I'm Kira.

355
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:08,073
That's what I wanted to tell you.

356
00:20:09,232 --> 00:20:11,697
Light is Kira?

357
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:13,779
Listen.

358
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:16,107
I won't allow you to ask Kiyomi who I am.

359
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,908
You don't need to know my identity.

360
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:19,243
Yes.

361
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:21,252
I'll leave the rest to you, God.

362
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:23,787
Do you understand?

363
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:25,035
I am Kira.

364
00:20:25,765 --> 00:20:27,170
The man who was on the phone

365
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:29,858
is one of my followers who I've shared my power with.

366
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:33,262
I... I can't believe it's you.

367
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,903
You were the only man I ever really admired.

368
00:20:36,288 --> 00:20:39,687
To be honest, the only man I ever felt a connection with.

369
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:42,308
And now to find you're Kira...

370
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:44,291
it's incredible.

371
00:20:46,283 --> 00:20:48,590
Please, join me, Kiyomi,

372
00:20:48,932 --> 00:20:51,554
and you will be the goddess of the New World.

373
00:20:53,355 --> 00:20:54,302
Oh, Light.

374
00:21:02,765 --> 00:21:04,279
Light, are you OK?

375
00:21:04,517 --> 00:21:05,404
Yeah.

376
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,102
Kiyomi was able to work things out with Kira.

377
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:09,921
I've decided that from now on,

378
00:21:09,946 --> 00:21:11,593
I'm going to pretend to be dating her.

379
00:21:11,954 --> 00:21:13,645
We might be able to find Kira that way.

380
00:21:14,465 --> 00:21:15,295
Delete.

381
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:16,195
Delete.

382
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:17,243
Delete.

383
00:21:17,354 --> 00:21:18,182
Delete.

384
00:21:18,272 --> 00:21:19,093
Delete.

385
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:20,199
Delete.

386
00:21:21,372 --> 00:21:22,971
Delete!

387
00:22:37,677 --> 00:22:38,773
Come to think of it,

388
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:41,855
it's always been a one on one battle between myself and L.

389
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,704
It's been going on since the beginning.

390
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:44,926
Alright, Near.

391
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:45,852
Fine.

392
00:22:45,877 --> 00:22:47,611
I'll come out if you come out.

393
00:22:47,636 --> 00:22:49,549
I'll accept your challenge.
