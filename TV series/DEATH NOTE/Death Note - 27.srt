1
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:31,396
What was that?

2
00:01:31,673 --> 00:01:32,506
Roger?

3
00:01:32,627 --> 00:01:33,893
What did you just say?

4
00:01:36,782 --> 00:01:38,772
I'm afraid L is dead.

5
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:40,902
He's dead?

6
00:01:40,954 --> 00:01:42,584
But... But how?

7
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:46,744
Was it Kira? Did Kira kill him?

8
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:49,071
Come on, Roger. You've got to tell me!

9
00:01:49,248 --> 00:01:50,275
Probably.

10
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:55,605
But he promised me he'd find Kira and execute
him, and now you're telling me that he's been killed.

11
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:57,355
Mello!

12
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:11,132
If you can't win the game, if you can't solve the puzzle,

13
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:13,882
then you're just a loser.

14
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:20,484
So, which of us did L pick? Me or Near?

15
00:02:23,424 --> 00:02:25,353
He hadn't chosen yet.

16
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:28,835
And now that he's gone, I'm afraid he won't be able to.

17
00:02:31,424 --> 00:02:32,406
Mello.

18
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,044
Listen.

19
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:35,427
You two Near.

20
00:02:35,452 --> 00:02:37,636
Can't the two of you work together?

21
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:38,596
All right.

22
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:39,811
Sounds good.

23
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:45,848
It'll never work, Roger.

24
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,399
We can't do this together.

25
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,466
You know I don't get along with the Near.

26
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:52,612
We've always competed against each other.

27
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:53,921
Always.

28
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:08,058
You know what?

29
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,287
It's fine.

30
00:03:10,438 --> 00:03:12,445
Near should be the one to succeed L.

31
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:15,156
He's not like me. He never gets emotional.

32
00:03:15,181 --> 00:03:18,042
He just uses his head, like it's a game or a puzzle.

33
00:03:21,597 --> 00:03:24,610
And as for me, I'm leaving this institution.

34
00:03:25,443 --> 00:03:26,720
Wait, Mello!

35
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:27,745
Don't waste your breath.

36
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:29,713
I'm almost 15 years old.

37
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:32,420
It's time I started living my own life.

38
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:43,736
A police officer who happened to
be nearby during Higuchi's arrest

39
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:45,626
overhead him talking about a notebook.

40
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,161
If you write a person's name in it with
their face in mind, that person will die.

41
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,612
So that's what you're saying
this notebook of death actually is.

42
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:54,715
That's right.

43
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:58,116
At this point, the Japanese police
should have it in their possession.

44
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:11,388
Mr. President, the current L is a fake.

45
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:13,080
He was created by the Japanese police

46
00:04:13,105 --> 00:04:16,969
to avoid confusion and panic amongst
the various international police agencies.

47
00:04:17,072 --> 00:04:18,621
The reak L is dead.

48
00:04:19,115 --> 00:04:20,553
Uh, Director Mason.

49
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:23,500
This boy, who is he?

50
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:24,595
Sir.

51
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,283
Near is Well, in a sense you could
call him the true successor to L.

52
00:04:52,382 --> 00:04:56,070
But still, it's impossible for us
to censor everything on the internet.

53
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,500
And we haven't had any new leads in a while.

54
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:01,359
But posting names and faces online?

55
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,869
I'm sorry, but if you ask me, it's
the people doing that who deserve to die.

56
00:05:06,234 --> 00:05:08,980
But I guess that's never gonna happen.

57
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:11,274
Kira gets a lot of his information from the internet,

58
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:12,980
so he's not gonna kill those people.

59
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:16,069
Matsu, you silly. You've got it all backwards.

60
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,092
Still.

61
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,384
I can imagine how some people must feel.

62
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:23,088
To them, the world's become a good place
for people who don't commit any crimes,

63
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:26,863
or rather, it's a good place for
innocent people who lead good lives.

64
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:29,353
Look who's talking.

65
00:05:29,378 --> 00:05:30,522
It's more than that.

66
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:33,192
Soon, everyone in the world will think that way.

67
00:05:33,745 --> 00:05:36,875
Are you all still talking about that Kira business?

68
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,866
Please, give it a rest for one afternoon, dear.

69
00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:40,825
Light, you too.

70
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:41,521
I'm home.

71
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:44,784
Hey, how's it going?

72
00:05:44,809 --> 00:05:46,409
We were just having tea.

73
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:48,482
Oh Light, Misa.

74
00:05:48,507 --> 00:05:50,704
Seems like it's been forever, you two.

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,356
Missed you guys.

76
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:54,468
Aw, we missed you too!

77
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:57,327
And you must be Mr. Matsuda, right?

78
00:05:57,726 --> 00:05:58,604
That's me.

79
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,591
Wow, it's been a long time.

80
00:06:00,616 --> 00:06:03,149
Thank you for always taking such good care of my father.

81
00:06:03,174 --> 00:06:04,755
Gee, Sayu.

82
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,870
You're all grown up.

83
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:08,217
And pretty.

84
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:10,842
Last time I saw you, you were this big.

85
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,476
Matsu! Your face is going bright red!

86
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:14,102
It is?

87
00:06:14,282 --> 00:06:15,622
I mean, no way!

88
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:16,722
Well, you can forget it.

89
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:18,690
I'll never let Sayu marry a cop.

90
00:06:18,715 --> 00:06:19,148
Huh?

91
00:06:19,315 --> 00:06:20,310
Yes. That's right.

92
00:06:20,335 --> 00:06:22,108
I'd never want that for my daughter.

93
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:22,846
Really?

94
00:06:23,235 --> 00:06:24,222
Aw man.

95
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:27,311
I never got the chance to
propose or even tell her I like her.

96
00:06:27,911 --> 00:06:29,910
You're too cruel to me, mom and dad.

97
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:30,845
Mom?

98
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:31,831
Anyway.

99
00:06:31,856 --> 00:06:33,995
I think you'd be a good catch, Mr. Matsuda.

100
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,774
What?

101
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,522
You... You really think so, Sayu?

102
00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:38,262
Yep!

103
00:06:38,368 --> 00:06:41,280
In fact, I was thinking if you were a little younger,

104
00:06:41,344 --> 00:06:43,980
I might've considered going out with you some time.

105
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:47,783
Guess my little sister's all grown up, isn't she?

106
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:48,763
No kidding.

107
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:51,081
She's already way more mature than Matsu.

108
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:54,090
But of course, Light hasn't changed one bit.

109
00:06:54,115 --> 00:06:56,936
You're just as wonderful and
handsome as when I first met you!

110
00:06:57,287 --> 00:06:59,220
You've already got a career and everything.

111
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:00,348
Make it official.

112
00:07:00,373 --> 00:07:03,418
You should stop living together
secretly and just get married already.

113
00:07:03,787 --> 00:07:05,661
I think that's a great idea.

114
00:07:06,957 --> 00:07:10,908
A heart-warming scene from the
most unfortunate family in the world.

115
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:12,400
Hm?

116
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:17,997
Yes? What is it, Aizawa?

117
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,948
Yes.

118
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:25,019
Right.

119
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:25,905
OK.

120
00:07:28,687 --> 00:07:29,620
We have to go.

121
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:32,038
Matsuda, Light. Come with me.

122
00:07:37,996 --> 00:07:38,871
A kidnapping?

123
00:07:38,896 --> 00:07:40,318
Involving who?

124
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:42,959
They got Director Takimura of the NPA.

125
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:44,822
I'm not sure who's behind it.

126
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:46,063
Ah, damn it.

127
00:07:46,477 --> 00:07:49,196
As if we don't have enough on our
plate already with the Kira case.

128
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:56,372
Are you sure about this?

129
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:57,999
Unfortunately, yeah.

130
00:07:58,024 --> 00:07:59,553
We got the call at 6:12.

131
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:01,419
That was about 45 minutes ago.

132
00:08:01,444 --> 00:08:05,559
In the meantime, we were able to confirm that
the call originated from the director's cell phone.

133
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:08,422
Did the kidnappers make any demands in terms of ransom?

134
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:10,426
They did.

135
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:14,302
They want a trade.

136
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:16,746
The director for the notebook.

137
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,506
Who's behind this?

138
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:21,711
And for what reason?

139
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:23,013
Do you think it's Kira?

140
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:23,890
Maybe not.

141
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:26,855
If the existence of the notebook has been
leaked, there could be any number of people

142
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,223
who'd want it for themselves.

143
00:08:28,248 --> 00:08:29,464
But hang on.

144
00:08:29,563 --> 00:08:32,256
Dad, did you say anything to
the director about the notebook?

145
00:08:32,281 --> 00:08:34,880
We all agreed to keep the
information between the six of us.

146
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:36,271
So, he didn't know it, did he?

147
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:39,626
I never told the director, so he
couldn't tell the kidnappers anything.

148
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,355
Someone knows about the Death Note.

149
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,703
And beyond that, they know
that the Japanese police have it.

150
00:08:46,728 --> 00:08:49,094
And now they've come to claim it for themselves.

151
00:08:49,653 --> 00:08:53,946
Notify every bureau in the police
department, but only about the kidnapping itself.

152
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:54,745
Got it.

153
00:09:09,577 --> 00:09:11,507
Has there been a call from the suspects?

154
00:09:11,532 --> 00:09:12,199
No.

155
00:09:12,224 --> 00:09:15,224
There's a visitor here who wants
to meet with Director Takimura.

156
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:16,121
What?

157
00:09:17,358 --> 00:09:19,066
My name is John McEnroe.

158
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:21,119
I'm an agent with the FBI.

159
00:09:21,296 --> 00:09:23,444
Of course, this is just an alias.

160
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,423
As my assignment involves Kira,
it's a necessary precaution.

161
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:28,239
Kira?

162
00:09:29,384 --> 00:09:32,551
Due to unforseen circumstances,
the director is unavailable.

163
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:35,733
If it's acceptable, you could speak with me instead.

164
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:38,501
Very well. That's fine.

165
00:09:38,962 --> 00:09:40,740
Pardon me, I'll get straight to the point.

166
00:09:40,765 --> 00:09:44,677
The Japanese police have proven
themselves to be unreliable.

167
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:46,897
So in order to solve the Kira case,

168
00:09:46,922 --> 00:09:49,908
we want you to hand over the notebook to us.

169
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:52,364
So the FBI was behind it!

170
00:09:52,663 --> 00:09:54,439
Where did you take the director?

171
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:56,238
What are you talking about?

172
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,470
Don't act like you don't know.

173
00:09:57,495 --> 00:09:59,126
This is a serious criminal offense.

174
00:09:59,151 --> 00:10:03,434
What would the FBI gain by capturing
the director of the Japanese NPA?

175
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,214
Then how do you know about the notebook?

176
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:05,551
What the hell is going on?

177
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:11,183
By the sound of things, it seems that the director of
the Japanese police force has been kidnapped by someone.

178
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:14,419
Specifically, someone who wants the notebook.

179
00:10:16,602 --> 00:10:18,326
All right, Commander Rester.

180
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:20,805
Pass on this message through our agent.

181
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:24,222
Suggest to the Japanese police that would
like to assist them in rescuing the director,

182
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:25,769
and apprehending the culprits.

183
00:10:25,906 --> 00:10:27,987
We'll take the notebook once we have the opportunity.

184
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:29,383
Roger that.

185
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:30,992
Attention.

186
00:10:31,017 --> 00:10:32,282
This is headquarters.

187
00:10:32,368 --> 00:10:34,110
We have new orders for you.

188
00:10:56,216 --> 00:10:57,984
Has he decided to say anything yet?

189
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:01,209
He told us the Japanese police
have begun to wimp out on Kira.

190
00:11:01,234 --> 00:11:05,964
Looks like right now, the only ones who are
officially working for L are Suichiro Yagami,

191
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:08,422
Konzo Mogi, and Tota Matsuda.

192
00:11:08,492 --> 00:11:09,714
Isn't that right?

193
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:11,435
Yeah.

194
00:11:11,782 --> 00:11:14,916
There was also Kida, but he was killed by Kira.

195
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:15,741
Right.

196
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:20,807
And as top cop, somehow you didn't know that
this notebook even existed, or that you had it.

197
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,355
Japanese cops must be a joke.

198
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:27,871
Of all the investigators on the task force,

199
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,924
Deputy Director Yagami would
be the highest ranking, right?

200
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:32,099
Yeah.

201
00:11:36,518 --> 00:11:39,546
My theory is that there are two notebooks out there.

202
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:41,808
One of them is in Kira's possession,

203
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,947
the other is with the NPA.

204
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,137
We're going to take both of them.

205
00:11:48,162 --> 00:11:49,008
Huh?

206
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:49,908
Don't worry.

207
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:52,756
As long as we do what Mello says, there'll be no mistakes.

208
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:56,175
It's been a year and a half since
he joined us, and in that entire time,

209
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,217
he's never been wrong about everything.

210
00:11:58,345 --> 00:11:59,853
Yeah, but that's what's so weird.

211
00:11:59,944 --> 00:12:03,829
If he was able to bring us the head of a
mafia boss that even Kira himself couldn't kill,

212
00:12:03,854 --> 00:12:06,488
why the hell would he even
need the notebook to begin with?

213
00:12:07,116 --> 00:12:09,312
It's not just the nobebook I'm after.

214
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:11,593
I want to eliminate my competition.

215
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:14,949
I will be the best.

216
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,334
I don't care what it takes.

217
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:20,187
I'll beat Near by any means necessary.

218
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,555
Boss!

219
00:12:58,066 --> 00:12:58,950
Shut up.

220
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:00,545
Can't you see that I'm busy?

221
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,559
I'm sorry.

222
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:06,536
But Eddie and I were talking for a minute, and it
looks like Takimura hung himself with his tie somehow.

223
00:13:08,003 --> 00:13:09,303
What's wrong with you?

224
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:10,187
Just great.

225
00:13:10,212 --> 00:13:12,618
What are we supposed to do with a dead hostage?

226
00:13:12,643 --> 00:13:14,460
No. This will be just fine.

227
00:13:14,485 --> 00:13:15,089
Huh?

228
00:13:15,704 --> 00:13:17,737
If Kira is responsible for this,

229
00:13:17,846 --> 00:13:21,054
we know he can't touch us since
he doesn't know our names or faces.

230
00:13:21,296 --> 00:13:23,706
That's why he went after Takimura instead.

231
00:13:24,146 --> 00:13:27,014
That means Kira is someone who knows about the kidnapping.

232
00:13:27,537 --> 00:13:30,491
That should make things rather interesting.

233
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:34,889
So what are we gonna do, Mello?

234
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,514
I'll tell you what we're going to do.

235
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:40,975
We're going to kidnap Soichiro
Yagami's daughter, Sayu Yagami.

236
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:50,026
We still haven't been able to find any leads
on either Director Takimura or the kidnappers.

237
00:13:50,075 --> 00:13:51,514
Things are getting pretty weird.

238
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,293
I mean, they should have contacted us by
now with further demands, but still nothing.

239
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,585
We know one thing.

240
00:13:56,694 --> 00:14:00,261
I found out the real name of the FBI agent, John McEnroe.

241
00:14:00,294 --> 00:14:03,986
According to his personnel file,
he's actually called Larry Connors.

242
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,372
Well, that's good to know.

243
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,961
He's also a genuine agent.

244
00:14:06,986 --> 00:14:09,186
His background and credentials check out.

245
00:14:09,211 --> 00:14:13,672
On top of that, the director of the FBI has
offered to help us rescue Director Takimura.

246
00:14:13,697 --> 00:14:15,897
I'm pretty sure we'll be able to trust them.

247
00:14:16,171 --> 00:14:18,909
But the director should already be dead by now.

248
00:14:19,132 --> 00:14:21,517
Why haven't the kidnappers said anything?

249
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:23,225
Are they gonna give up on the deal

250
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,134
just because they lost their bargaining chip?

251
00:14:25,293 --> 00:14:28,115
I didn't think our opponents would be such pushovers.

252
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:31,190
Remember, Dad, and the rest of you, too.

253
00:14:31,215 --> 00:14:33,510
We're going to have to be extremely careful.

254
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:38,810
The director might not have known about the notebook,
but he does know who was originally working with L.

255
00:14:38,953 --> 00:14:41,154
It's possible the kidnappers might come after us.

256
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:42,201
Hey, Light?

257
00:14:42,226 --> 00:14:43,127
Huh?

258
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:47,119
I'll be a good girl and go to bed by myself, OK?

259
00:14:47,694 --> 00:14:48,857
Uh...

260
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:50,158
Yeah. Goodnight.

261
00:14:50,787 --> 00:14:51,951
Goodnight, everyone.

262
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:54,723
Guess I'll hang out around here.

263
00:14:55,674 --> 00:14:58,479
It just occurred to me, we're
not the only ones in danger here.

264
00:14:58,504 --> 00:15:00,031
Our families are at risk.

265
00:15:00,765 --> 00:15:02,519
A call from the Director's cellphone.

266
00:15:02,544 --> 00:15:04,002
It must be the kidnappers.

267
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,442
Quick, Aizawa.

268
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:07,026
Got it. Tracing.

269
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:12,031
This is Yagami.

270
00:15:12,056 --> 00:15:12,618
Look.

271
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:15,367
About trading the director in exchange for the notebook?

272
00:15:15,594 --> 00:15:17,240
The deal's been canceled.

273
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:19,056
Takimura is dead.

274
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:21,013
You bastards!

275
00:15:21,038 --> 00:15:21,567
What did you do?

276
00:15:21,592 --> 00:15:24,013
It's only canceled, though, regarding the director.

277
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:25,505
The new deal is this.

278
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,782
The notebook for Sayu Yagami.

279
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:28,567
Huh?

280
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:34,798
Seeing as you're the Deputy
Director of the Japanese police,

281
00:15:34,823 --> 00:15:37,254
it would be stupid to ask you not to call the cops.

282
00:15:37,323 --> 00:15:40,455
But you had better handle this
on your own, without backup.

283
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,171
If I see the police making any big
movements in the next little while,

284
00:15:44,196 --> 00:15:46,589
I'll kill your daughter! That's right.

285
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:48,729
Just as easily as we killed the director.

286
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:52,298
I'll send you a photo of Takimura's
corpse, to prove I mean business.

287
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:53,925
Take a good look.

288
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,562
I'll contact you tomorrow.

289
00:15:55,861 --> 00:15:57,338
Huh? Wait!

290
00:15:58,075 --> 00:15:59,690
Damn, they got me.

291
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:03,055
They used the director's death
as an opportunity to get to Sayu.

292
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,991
Looks like things are getting interesting again.

293
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:09,245
Sir, I...

294
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,990
I... can't believe they'd go this far.

295
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:13,230
Damn them.

296
00:16:13,987 --> 00:16:15,871
Yes, yes. Coming.

297
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:17,660
Darling?

298
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,329
You usually never call from your
work phone. Is something the matter?

299
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:23,113
Huh? Sayu?

300
00:16:23,812 --> 00:16:24,739
I don't know.

301
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:27,991
Now that you mention it, she is late coming home.

302
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:29,408
Sayu.

303
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,769
Dad, are you OK?

304
00:16:39,784 --> 00:16:41,613
I've just realized something.

305
00:16:41,638 --> 00:16:43,494
I think it was Kira who killed the director.

306
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,737
Not the kidnappers.

307
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:45,747
Huh?

308
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:49,550
He probably did it because he doesn't want
the notebook to fall into the wrong hands.

309
00:16:49,602 --> 00:16:51,542
Kira claims to be justice.

310
00:16:52,256 --> 00:16:54,837
He wouldn't want the notebook used by someone evil.

311
00:16:55,218 --> 00:16:59,543
If he killed the director, then it's reasonable
to assume he has ways of obtaining information

312
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:01,306
from within the police force.

313
00:17:01,426 --> 00:17:04,072
That means we should be the ones who investigate this.

314
00:17:04,097 --> 00:17:05,516
We leave the police out of it.

315
00:17:05,728 --> 00:17:06,709
Otherwise...

316
00:17:07,003 --> 00:17:10,308
Kira will find out about it,
and probably kill the hostage.

317
00:17:10,386 --> 00:17:12,423
Right. And we can't take that chance.

318
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,053
Near.

319
00:17:20,613 --> 00:17:25,082
We've just received a report that the director
of the Japanese Police Agency has been killed.

320
00:17:25,313 --> 00:17:27,336
I see. By whom?

321
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:28,361
By whom?

322
00:17:28,386 --> 00:17:30,596
Uh, the kidnappers, of course. Who else?

323
00:17:30,621 --> 00:17:32,717
It'd be interesting if it turned out to be Kira.

324
00:17:32,775 --> 00:17:33,336
Hm?

325
00:17:33,465 --> 00:17:35,020
That's a very good point.

326
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:39,346
The police won't be trading their notebook if
the hostage is dead, so it protect Kira's interests.

327
00:17:39,446 --> 00:17:44,121
And if it is in fact Kira, that can
narrow down our list of suspects significantly.

328
00:17:44,172 --> 00:17:44,631
Hm?

329
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:48,482
By the way, Commander Rester,

330
00:17:48,517 --> 00:17:50,785
have you been able to determine his whereabouts yet?

331
00:17:50,954 --> 00:17:51,958
Not yet.

332
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,677
We were able to confirm that he
left the institution four years ago,

333
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,467
but nothing beyond that.

334
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,247
Very well, that clinches it.

335
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:01,106
What?

336
00:18:02,337 --> 00:18:04,304
Mello, you never change.

337
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:08,717
You always overlook the most important things
because you let your emotions get the better of you.

338
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:12,354
Or perhaps you're not even involved in this case.

339
00:18:12,754 --> 00:18:15,736
How could you leave your photo behind at the orphanage?

340
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:20,979
This is Yagami.

341
00:18:21,004 --> 00:18:22,671
Your daughter has finally arrived.

342
00:18:22,696 --> 00:18:23,589
It's about time.

343
00:18:23,614 --> 00:18:24,567
What do you mean?

344
00:18:24,592 --> 00:18:27,703
You already have a pretty good
idea of where we are, don't you?

345
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,813
Hm.

346
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,689
We'll make the exchange here.

347
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:33,181
Come to LA, by yourself, in two days.

348
00:18:33,206 --> 00:18:35,973
And of course, bring the notebook with you.

349
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:38,446
I won't make the trade unless I'm sure my daughter's safe.

350
00:18:38,471 --> 00:18:39,924
I want to talk to her right now.

351
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:41,647
How about this?

352
00:18:41,672 --> 00:18:43,010
I'll send you another photo.

353
00:18:43,035 --> 00:18:44,500
That should satisfy you.

354
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:52,171
Sayu.

355
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,673
Hey Chief, we've narrowed the
call down to 5th Street in LA.

356
00:18:59,762 --> 00:19:02,484
I just checked out the show
that was playing in the background,

357
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,820
and it's being broadcast right now on a local LA station.

358
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,895
They must have shown us that
so we know the photo's recent.

359
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:11,347
Thank goodness.

360
00:19:11,947 --> 00:19:13,627
At least we know she's still alive.

361
00:19:13,922 --> 00:19:15,129
That's reassuring.

362
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,708
I'm taking the notebook to Los Angeles.

363
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:25,754
It's my decision, both as Deputy Director of the
Japanese Police Force, and as Sayu Yagami's father.

364
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:28,079
I'll take full responsibility for the consequences.

365
00:19:28,104 --> 00:19:29,238
That's my final word.

366
00:19:29,263 --> 00:19:30,072
Wait, Dad.

367
00:19:30,097 --> 00:19:32,555
Before we do anything, we have to come up with a plan.

368
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,324
He's right, Chief. We can't rush in.

369
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:36,569
But I have to be in LA in two days.

370
00:19:36,794 --> 00:19:37,893
We don't have time.

371
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:47,212
So what you're telling me is that
Kira killed Takimura, not the kidnappers?

372
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:49,933
I'm simply putting it forward as a possibility.

373
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:54,946
If it does turn out to be true, then it means Kira
must be getting his information from the Japanese police.

374
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:55,854
Hm.

375
00:19:59,159 --> 00:19:59,849
Hm?

376
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,903
Yes?

377
00:20:01,928 --> 00:20:02,913
This is L.

378
00:20:02,938 --> 00:20:03,392
Hm?

379
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:05,396
I don't believe it.

380
00:20:05,674 --> 00:20:06,467
It's L.

381
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,517
I've already heard what investigator John McEnroe,

382
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,134
or rather, Larry Connors has had to say to Deputy Director.

383
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,762
Yagami in regards to the notebook and the Kira case.

384
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:19,410
Will you help us with the investigation
into NPA Director Takimura's murder?

385
00:20:19,965 --> 00:20:21,375
I see. Well...

386
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:22,835
Pass me the phone.

387
00:20:24,618 --> 00:20:25,199
Huh?

388
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:31,356
I'm pleased to meet you at last, L number two.

389
00:20:36,656 --> 00:20:37,751
Number two?

390
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:40,127
What do you mean by that?

391
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,354
Who is this?

392
00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:43,529
There's really no point in trying to hide it.

393
00:20:43,671 --> 00:20:47,979
We are a new organization known as
the SPK, or Special Provision for Kira.

394
00:20:48,004 --> 00:20:51,383
It was established to find and
capture Kira without the help of L.

395
00:20:51,778 --> 00:20:55,881
Furthermore, seven of our top
members already know of L's death.

396
00:20:56,151 --> 00:20:57,067
They do?

397
00:20:57,494 --> 00:20:59,771
Where'd they hear that? Who the hell told them?

398
00:21:00,036 --> 00:21:03,581
As for myself, I am at the center of the SPK.

399
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:07,457
You can address me as N.

400
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:08,484
N?

401
00:21:09,104 --> 00:21:11,992
Who is this guy? Is he joking?

402
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:17,741
But, this strange feeling.

403
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:19,498
What is it?

404
00:22:36,672 --> 00:22:38,482
Damn. What's going on?

405
00:22:38,507 --> 00:22:40,488
I've already checked today's flight crews.

406
00:22:40,513 --> 00:22:42,313
No one on board was suspicious.

407
00:22:42,338 --> 00:22:43,963
I can still make it.

408
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:48,386
But at this rate, is my only option to kill Sayu?
