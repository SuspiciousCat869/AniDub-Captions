1
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:33,260
Near, if you don't mind me asking,

2
00:01:33,285 --> 00:01:34,242
what do you make of all this?

3
00:01:34,267 --> 00:01:36,733
I'm interested to hear what
your thoughts are on this case.

4
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,709
The current Kira is foolish and overconfident.

5
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:42,945
Not to mention unusually cooperative with the task force.

6
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:46,372
So much so that I suspect he's
working hand in hand with them.

7
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:47,224
You think so?

8
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:49,181
That would make the second L and Kira...

9
00:01:49,822 --> 00:01:51,288
one in the same person.

10
00:01:51,662 --> 00:01:52,409
What?

11
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:54,465
That can't be.

12
00:01:54,702 --> 00:01:55,653
Are you serious?

13
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:56,583
Yes, I am.

14
00:01:56,994 --> 00:01:59,838
Having said that, I'll admit that I'm only 7% certain.

15
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,423
Don't worry, Commander Rester.

16
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:05,790
Making assumptions is part of any investigation.

17
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,997
If we're wrong, all it'll cost is an apology.

18
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:19,337
There have been less crimes lately
in Japan, and around the world.

19
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:21,102
It's because of Kira.

20
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,815
My daddy told mee that, if you do something bad,

21
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:27,127
your name will be written on the
internet and Kira will kill you.

22
00:02:27,427 --> 00:02:28,890
Come on. I don't have all day.

23
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,098
How am I supposed to file this report without your name?

24
00:02:31,204 --> 00:02:32,404
Will you give me a break?

25
00:02:32,638 --> 00:02:34,035
Please, not my name!

26
00:02:34,716 --> 00:02:37,636
Leave me alone or I'll put your names on the internet.

27
00:03:04,377 --> 00:03:08,166
I will proclaim this right here and
now, to all the people of the Earth.

28
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:09,979
Kira is true justice!

29
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:16,802
Good evening.

30
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:19,829
It is my honor to be appointed by Kira as his spokesman.

31
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:22,402
This is not a hoax. It's the absolute truth.

32
00:03:22,805 --> 00:03:26,756
I realize that there will be many
people who might try to have me killed now.

33
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:30,315
But, I'm prepared to risk by life...

34
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,835
Kira's Kingdom, huh?

35
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,199
What a horrible title.

36
00:03:33,224 --> 00:03:34,316
This is insanity.

37
00:03:34,341 --> 00:03:35,610
...can hear Kira's voice.

38
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:39,095
Trying to capture Kira is an unforgivable crime.

39
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:40,368
If you happen to know...

40
00:03:40,393 --> 00:03:43,247
If anybody deserves to be killed by Kira, it's this guy.

41
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:45,516
...a criminal, or a regular citizen.

42
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:47,715
Switch it back to the press conference.

43
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:49,327
The president's about to start.

44
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:52,160
I wonder what it's about.

45
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:55,739
All they said was that it was gonna be
some sort of international announcement.

46
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:58,317
You don't do anything but watch TV, do you?

47
00:03:58,358 --> 00:03:58,673
Wha?

48
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,737
Good morning. I'm gonna try to keep this brief.

49
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:08,535
No way.

50
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:13,466
The United States will no longer oppose Kira.

51
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,276
Those cowards!

52
00:04:19,587 --> 00:04:21,067
I've done it.

53
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:23,922
I've even been brought America to its knees.

54
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:26,237
W-What the hell is he talking about?

55
00:04:26,397 --> 00:04:28,031
Have they been threatened or something?

56
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:30,664
Are you saying that Kira is justice?

57
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,799
Justice?

58
00:04:35,106 --> 00:04:36,598
No, no, I never said that.

59
00:04:36,894 --> 00:04:39,893
But because if Kira, war and
conflict have ceased to exist.

60
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:42,572
Criminal organizations are in a state of ruin,

61
00:04:42,597 --> 00:04:45,560
not only in the United States, but in all free nations.

62
00:04:45,675 --> 00:04:48,216
Anyone who defies Kira head on will be killed.

63
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:49,305
That is a fact.

64
00:04:49,513 --> 00:04:52,186
We are not acknowledging Kira as a symbol of justice.

65
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:54,302
We are simply saying that, as a country,

66
00:04:54,484 --> 00:04:56,710
we will not take any actions against him.

67
00:04:56,735 --> 00:04:58,229
How is that any different?

68
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,322
You're saying that you accept Kira?

69
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:01,764
Explain yourself!

70
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:04,296
You call yourself a representative of our country?

71
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:05,376
I can't believe it.

72
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:06,819
This is America.

73
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:09,468
How can their government do
something so cowardly like this?

74
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,670
Uh. Do you guys mind if I ask a serious question?

75
00:05:12,982 --> 00:05:14,774
Oh, boy. What is it this time?

76
00:05:14,832 --> 00:05:16,940
Are you telling us you're not always serious?

77
00:05:17,438 --> 00:05:20,696
Do you guys ever think that
maybe Kira isn't completely evil?

78
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:21,510
What?

79
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:23,547
What kind of question is that, Matsuda?

80
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:25,061
I've been thinking about it,

81
00:05:25,127 --> 00:05:27,816
and part of me just doesn't believe that he is.

82
00:05:28,114 --> 00:05:30,644
So now you think Kira is justice too?

83
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:32,659
I don't really know.

84
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:37,102
But I think that Kira's trying to fight
evil and change the world in his own way

85
00:05:37,272 --> 00:05:42,116
and, well, the world's become a good place
for people who live honest lives, so maybe...

86
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,423
You're wrong, Matsuda!

87
00:05:43,538 --> 00:05:46,027
People are only afraid of losing their own lives.

88
00:05:46,438 --> 00:05:47,999
How can you think that's real peace?

89
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:49,114
I understand that.

90
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,023
Believe me, I know that as well as you.

91
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,431
It's just that I can also understand the other side.

92
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:56,001
I can see why all those people call Kira a savior.

93
00:05:56,179 --> 00:05:57,510
I'm not like you.

94
00:05:57,747 --> 00:06:00,969
When it comes down to it, I've
always been a really weak person.

95
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,613
But I'm also a detective.

96
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:04,170
I can't accept Kira.

97
00:06:04,483 --> 00:06:06,038
I know it's my duty to catch him.

98
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,533
No, I want to catch him.

99
00:06:08,688 --> 00:06:10,923
It's just that I can't completely hate him either.

100
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:14,640
I guess I must be crazy or something, huh?

101
00:06:15,582 --> 00:06:17,702
No, you're not crazy. You're normal.

102
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:19,823
You too, Light?

103
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:21,151
What are you talking about?

104
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,899
I'm sure that, on some level,

105
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:26,961
Kira probably knows that what he's doing is evil,

106
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:31,520
but he'll try to change the world,
even as a martyr, at the cost of his soul.

107
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:33,652
That's his brand of justice.

108
00:06:34,282 --> 00:06:36,520
I bet that's what's going through Kira's mind.

109
00:06:37,472 --> 00:06:39,657
Anyway, we shouldn't be arguing about it.

110
00:06:39,797 --> 00:06:41,850
Good or evil, it's not our call.

111
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:44,527
All we have to think about is catching him.

112
00:06:45,415 --> 00:06:47,943
If Kira gets caught, then that makes him evil.

113
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,856
But if he wins and rules the
world, then I guess he's justice.

114
00:06:55,204 --> 00:06:59,454
But from now on, the world will
start leaning in favor of Kira.

115
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:01,644
It's only a matter of time.

116
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:04,414
Kira will be justice.

117
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,764
What's going to happen to us now?

118
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:11,812
It looks like we've been disbanded,
thanks to that chicken of a president.

119
00:07:12,178 --> 00:07:14,458
No. He's not even a chicken.

120
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,791
He's less than a maggot.

121
00:07:19,546 --> 00:07:20,985
You've got to be kidding.

122
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,000
There's no way accepting Kira will lead to anything good.

123
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:46,604
Huh?

124
00:07:50,648 --> 00:07:51,331
Huh?

125
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:55,177
So you're alive.

126
00:07:58,948 --> 00:07:59,365
Near.

127
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:01,707
Hm?

128
00:08:04,387 --> 00:08:05,523
What should we do?

129
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:06,724
Let him in.

130
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,097
Mello, welcome.

131
00:08:19,553 --> 00:08:20,852
Drop your weapon!

132
00:08:25,883 --> 00:08:28,456
Everyone, please put away your guns.

133
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:30,933
Having a shoot out here would achieve nothing.

134
00:08:31,706 --> 00:08:33,239
Sir, with all due respect.

135
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:34,975
Mello's the one who killed our partners.

136
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:37,278
Please don't make me say it again.

137
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:40,546
Remember that our primary
objective is still to catch Kira.

138
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:44,138
Killing Mello right now will do
nothing to benefit our investigation.

139
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:47,548
All right.

140
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:53,600
It seems like things have been
going just as you planned, Near.

141
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:54,728
Yes.

142
00:08:54,877 --> 00:08:58,309
I take it you've already heard all
about the second L from Lidner by now.

143
00:08:58,552 --> 00:09:03,212
I've pretty much figured out who Kira is, and
it's mostly thanks to everything you've done.

144
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:06,458
Shut up, Near!

145
00:09:08,063 --> 00:09:11,469
I'm not just a tool for you to use in
order to solve your puzzles, you know.

146
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:13,330
Mello.

147
00:09:13,355 --> 00:09:15,787
If you really want to shoot me, then go ahead and do it.

148
00:09:20,781 --> 00:09:21,562
Stop.

149
00:09:21,746 --> 00:09:25,026
If you shoot him, then the rest of us
will have no choice but to shoot you too.

150
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:27,147
What will it solve if both of you die?

151
00:09:27,682 --> 00:09:29,425
That's just what Kira wants.

152
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:34,070
You have a good point.

153
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:36,233
Anyway, I'm only here for one thing.

154
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,512
I came to take back that photograph you have.

155
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:39,462
Of course.

156
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:40,909
I got it from the orphanage.

157
00:09:40,941 --> 00:09:43,287
There was only one and no copies have been made.

158
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,534
I've already gone ahead and dealt
with everyone who knows your face,

159
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,557
both inside and outside Wammy's house.

160
00:09:48,582 --> 00:09:49,697
they'll keep quiet.

161
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:55,505
I can't say 100% for certain, but it shouldn't
be possible for you to be killed by the notebook.

162
00:09:57,349 --> 00:10:00,266
Is that the only business you had with me, Mello?

163
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:04,734
Near.

164
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,590
Let's get one thing straight.

165
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:19,907
I have no intention of working together with you on this.

166
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:21,127
Yes, I know.

167
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,837
At the same time, I can't just take my photo and leave.

168
00:10:23,862 --> 00:10:26,088
That wouldn't be right. So I'll settle my debt.

169
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:29,018
The killer notebook.

170
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,791
It belongs to a Shinigami.

171
00:10:31,194 --> 00:10:34,468
Whoever touches it is able to see a god of death.

172
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:36,467
That's crazy.

173
00:10:36,492 --> 00:10:38,397
Who the hell would believe in something like that?

174
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,734
I would. I believe him completely.

175
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,916
What good would it do for him to
tell an outrageous lie like that?

176
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:48,035
Even if he had something to gain, he could
at least come up with a more believable story.

177
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:51,205
Therefore, these gods of death must exist.

178
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,483
The notebook I obtained had
previously belonged to another Shinigami,

179
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,228
perhaps even Kira himself.

180
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:59,922
Also, some of the rules written inside are actually fake.

181
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,428
That's all I can tell you for now.

182
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:16,228
Near.

183
00:11:16,815 --> 00:11:17,581
Mello?

184
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:25,297
Which of us is going to reach Kira first, I wonder?

185
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:27,625
The race is on.

186
00:11:28,295 --> 00:11:30,733
We're both headed towards the same destination.

187
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:32,635
I'll be waiting for you.

188
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:34,630
Right.

189
00:11:57,277 --> 00:11:58,829
Fake rules.

190
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:03,540
There's no doubt that the notebook can cause
heart attacks and control its victims to a degree.

191
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:06,006
As for burning it or tearing it up,

192
00:12:06,157 --> 00:12:10,222
the notebook still exists, and there's no
way to confirm the rule one way or the other.

193
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,265
That means...

194
00:12:19,068 --> 00:12:24,891
the false rule must be the one that states a person
will die if he doesn't write a name within 13 days.

195
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,399
Giovanni.

196
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,586
Please set up a connection to L.

197
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:32,726
Yes, sir.

198
00:12:35,612 --> 00:12:36,336
It's Near.

199
00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:38,384
Yes?

200
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,271
L, I thought you should know that we caught Mello.

201
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:41,881
Huh?

202
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:43,936
But he escaped soon afterwards.

203
00:12:44,869 --> 00:12:47,319
We were able to interrogate him for a while.

204
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:49,562
He didn't really escape, did he?

205
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:51,371
You let him get away. Am I right?

206
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:52,135
No.

207
00:12:52,322 --> 00:12:54,413
We tried to restrain him, but he was too quick.

208
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:58,862
Anyway, Mello mentioned that there was some
sort of Shinigami attached to the notebook.

209
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,397
Have you been able to confirm
the existence of such a creature?

210
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:03,905
Yes.

211
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,600
I can tell you for a fact that Shinigami do exist.

212
00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:10,774
I didn't share that information with you at the beginning
because I was certain you would never believe me.

213
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:14,609
I would like to ask the Shinigami a few questions.

214
00:13:14,868 --> 00:13:16,905
Forget it. I'm not up for that.

215
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:21,651
The thing that's bothering me the most about this
is the issue of those rules written in the notebook.

216
00:13:21,738 --> 00:13:24,020
I have reason to believe that one of them is fake.

217
00:13:24,045 --> 00:13:24,713
Huh?

218
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,297
A fake rule?

219
00:13:26,343 --> 00:13:27,081
Yes.

220
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:30,244
L, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this.

221
00:13:30,323 --> 00:13:33,045
Out of all the rules, which do you think is the fake?

222
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,157
I'd like to know.

223
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:38,757
By process of elimination, the obvious choice

224
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:41,226
would be the one stating that
the owner of a notebook will die

225
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:43,645
if they don't write a new name in it every 13 days.

226
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:44,841
I don't believe that.

227
00:13:44,936 --> 00:13:46,800
I thought you might say so.

228
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:48,543
I've reached the same conclusion.

229
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:54,179
Shinigami, you know the rules of the notebook well.

230
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:56,046
Tell us, are any of them false?

231
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:57,969
No. They are all real.

232
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:02,266
I see. You have a Shinigami there with you?

233
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,266
Yes.

234
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:05,636
Is that so?

235
00:14:06,202 --> 00:14:08,438
I think I'm beginning to get the picture.

236
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,894
In other words, Kira is there in the room,
and he's making the Shinigami lie on his behalf.

237
00:14:14,223 --> 00:14:16,064
Whoa, this guy's good.

238
00:14:16,191 --> 00:14:17,037
He nailed it.

239
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,178
I don't get what he means.

240
00:14:19,203 --> 00:14:21,653
So what if the Shinigami is lying, and the rule's fake?

241
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,459
It doesn't really change anything, does it?

242
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:24,701
Yes, it does.

243
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:27,303
It means that Light's incarceration would be meaningless.

244
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:30,217
The rule says you die if you don't continue writing names.

245
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:35,465
But if that's false, being alive after more than 13
days in confinement wouldn't really prove anything.

246
00:14:37,262 --> 00:14:39,921
But even if that's true, it doesn't mean he's guilty.

247
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,950
Besides, there's no way that Light can be Kira.

248
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:46,713
Before he passed away, the deputy director himself
was able to confirm that he didn't have a notebook.

249
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:58,662
If there's a problem, I suggest
we verify the rule this way.

250
00:14:58,902 --> 00:15:01,812
I will volunteer to write down
Mello's real name in the notebook.

251
00:15:02,746 --> 00:15:04,513
Of course, that means he'll die.

252
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:08,409
If I also die 13 days later, well, then I guess Kira wins.

253
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,977
Either way, it's a gamble I'm quite willing to make.

254
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:13,938
What? So this is just a game to him?

255
00:15:14,412 --> 00:15:18,661
Testing and confirming the 13 day rule
can only benefit the Kira investigation.

256
00:15:18,823 --> 00:15:21,729
And other than my possible
death, there would be no drawbacks.

257
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:25,304
I'm willing to put my life on the
line if it will help us solve the case.

258
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,991
If I answer him based on my feelings alone,

259
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:30,083
it will only make me look worse to everyone.

260
00:15:30,108 --> 00:15:31,760
Could you please wait for a moment?

261
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,928
We need to discuss your suggestion.

262
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:37,309
OK. What are your thoughts?

263
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:40,570
We can say that we must respect human life

264
00:15:40,893 --> 00:15:44,438
and deny this request, but I can't suggest that.

265
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:46,666
I'm the one under suspicion.

266
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,457
It's a tough call.

267
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:50,209
Mello killed the deputy director.

268
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:52,546
If Near is willing, I wouldn't stop him.

269
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:54,231
I'm against the idea, myself.

270
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:57,159
I don't believe that Kira is hiding among us.

271
00:15:57,468 --> 00:16:00,371
We can't use the notebook, no matter what happens.

272
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,619
We should respect the deputy director's wishes to the end.

273
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:06,267
I feel the same. I'm opposed to the test.

274
00:16:06,468 --> 00:16:07,149
Hm.

275
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,707
Near, we've talked it over, and we can't
allow you to use the notebook like that.

276
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:15,542
I had a feeling you might say so. No matter.

277
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:17,804
Just one last question before I go.

278
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,630
To the members of the Japanese task force,

279
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:25,291
was there ever a point in the investigation
where the second L was suspected to be Kira,

280
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:27,317
even if the suspicions were later dropped?

281
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,396
If you've been listening to our conversation so far

282
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:34,098
and have any intention of helping
my investigation in taking down Kira,

283
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:35,898
then call the number I'm about to give you.

284
00:16:36,223 --> 00:16:38,190
Day or not, I will answer.

285
00:16:38,438 --> 00:16:39,645
The choice is up to you.

286
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:43,162
There's no way that Light could be Kira.

287
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:46,175
No, it's more like I don't want to believe he's Kira.

288
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,472
But if the 13 day rule is fake, then we
really can't say for sure that he's innocent.

289
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,204
This could change everything.

290
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:01,849
Near. I have to kill him.

291
00:17:09,702 --> 00:17:10,759
Yes? Hello?

292
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,385
This is Kira.

293
00:17:13,303 --> 00:17:14,413
Is this a joke?

294
00:17:14,573 --> 00:17:18,548
If you want proof, I can read out a list
of people that I'm going to punish tomorrow.

295
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,783
That way you can check it and
make your final decision afterwards.

296
00:17:22,378 --> 00:17:27,112
Mr. President, I am very grateful that you
and your country have sympathized with me,

297
00:17:27,137 --> 00:17:29,809
but I'm afraid even that much isn't enough.

298
00:17:30,004 --> 00:17:33,757
The SPK is still trying to catch
me, despite your recent announcement.

299
00:17:34,035 --> 00:17:38,427
I want you to stop them
immediately, and formally disband them.

300
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:43,420
At the same time, I want you to use the American police,

301
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:48,482
the CIA, the FBI, and all other law
enforcement organizations at your disposal

302
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:51,443
to find out where the SPK members are currently hiding.

303
00:17:51,745 --> 00:17:54,012
As soon as you've found their base of operations,

304
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:56,904
I want you to forward that information to a third party.

305
00:17:56,929 --> 00:17:58,998
I will give you this contact shortly.

306
00:17:59,557 --> 00:18:04,165
Mr. President, whether you live
a long life or not is up to you.

307
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:05,999
Don't forget that.

308
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,040
I understand.

309
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:16,123
Mr. Demegawa, please wait a moment.

310
00:18:16,148 --> 00:18:17,455
Why are you going to New York?

311
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,832
We are going to crush an
organization that dares to defy Kira.

312
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:22,647
it will be on live TV.

313
00:18:24,257 --> 00:18:26,104
This is a direct order from Kira,

314
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:28,927
and it came through the President
of the United States himself.

315
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:29,843
Huh?

316
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:31,862
I don't know what's going to happen when we get there.

317
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:35,072
Hell, I don't even know what I'm
saying anymore, and I don't really care.

318
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:40,418
Sakura TV's ratings are gonna rocket
to 100, no, 120% for this special.

319
00:18:40,546 --> 00:18:42,497
Ha ha ha ha ha!

320
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:43,836
Come on, everyone!

321
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:47,167
The new age of Kira is about to arrive!

322
00:18:55,976 --> 00:18:58,321
The previous L was suspicious of Light.

323
00:18:58,691 --> 00:19:02,528
But if Light is Kira, and I just come
out and say we should investigate again,

324
00:19:02,734 --> 00:19:05,014
then I'll probably end up dead, just like L.

325
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,567
That won't solve anything.

326
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,190
The 13 day rule, huh?

327
00:19:10,378 --> 00:19:11,139
Aizawa.

328
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:11,885
Huh?

329
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:13,722
We have a long history.

330
00:19:13,747 --> 00:19:17,223
I can tell exactly what you're
thinking about, and what's bothering you.

331
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,647
Between you and me, you should go
ahead and do what you think is right.

332
00:19:21,112 --> 00:19:22,815
I didn't trust L to begin with.

333
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,235
I never did, to be honest.

334
00:19:24,378 --> 00:19:27,971
I didn't sign up to join the Kira
task force because Light was running it.

335
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:30,205
I joined because I wanted to work with you.

336
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,360
Ide.

337
00:19:32,134 --> 00:19:32,886
All right.

338
00:19:33,057 --> 00:19:36,076
I'll see if I can contact Near without letting Light know.

339
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:37,504
OK.

340
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:39,628
I'll make sure that no one knows what you're doing.

341
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:40,612
You can count on me.

342
00:20:01,557 --> 00:20:04,421
Light, I really want to believe

343
00:20:04,694 --> 00:20:06,569
that you're not Kira.

344
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:12,709
This is really bad.

345
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:14,787
Turn on the TV. It's Demegawa!

346
00:20:14,812 --> 00:20:15,424
Huh?

347
00:20:18,393 --> 00:20:20,249
This is Demegawa live.

348
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:24,170
My comrades and I have finally pinpointed
the hideout of the evil organization

349
00:20:24,195 --> 00:20:26,572
bent on trying to catch our beloved god Kira.

350
00:20:26,731 --> 00:20:29,139
We now have the building completely surrounded!

351
00:20:29,356 --> 00:20:30,354
Come on out!

352
00:20:31,216 --> 00:20:32,684
Break down the door!

353
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:36,420
Right now our enemies appear
to be hiding within the building,

354
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:38,969
but they won't be able to hide from us for long.

355
00:20:39,061 --> 00:20:40,911
Behold the power of the people!

356
00:20:40,943 --> 00:20:43,013
The power of justice!

357
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:49,627
As soon as Near escapes, I'm
gonna write his name in the notebook.

358
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,129
Don't worry, Light. I won't let you down.

359
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:56,189
At this rate, we'll be dragged
outside unless we stop them somehow.

360
00:20:59,012 --> 00:20:59,737
L.

361
00:21:00,356 --> 00:21:01,726
What's going on, Near?

362
00:21:02,414 --> 00:21:06,065
Could it be that this is some sort
of plot by Mello to finish off the SPK?

363
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:06,726
No.

364
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:10,190
Surely it couldn't be that the SPK's security was so lax

365
00:21:10,215 --> 00:21:13,209
that even a normal citizen could
find out where it was located.

366
00:21:14,354 --> 00:21:15,293
Damn it.

367
00:21:15,323 --> 00:21:17,066
He's lying through his teeth.

368
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,464
I win, Near.

369
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:40,700
I can definitely use this man.

370
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:43,147
He worships Kira from the bottom of his heart.

371
00:22:43,172 --> 00:22:47,342
He understands that he was chosen the
moment he took possession of the notebook.

372
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,710
There was no mistake in my selection.
