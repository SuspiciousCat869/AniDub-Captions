1
00:01:26,126 --> 00:01:30,437
And once you're fully convinced I'm
the real thing, you and I can get married.

2
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:34,511
And so, based on what he said, Higuchi is Kira!

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,100
If the killing of criminals stops now,

4
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:54,635
then there's no doubt that Higuchi
is the one with Kira's powers.

5
00:01:55,631 --> 00:02:00,097
However, I know Amane would do almost anything for Light.

6
00:02:00,316 --> 00:02:02,720
But to think that she would actually go this far?

7
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:05,355
If criminals do stop dying after this,

8
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,274
it will make it difficult to determine a critical element,

9
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,050
how Kira conducts his murders.

10
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:13,467
I have to think of a plan.

11
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,227
Misa.

12
00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:17,752
How did you get Higuchi to confess?

13
00:02:17,777 --> 00:02:20,314
Easy. That guy's totally in love with me.

14
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:23,544
All I had to do was tell him I'd
marry him if he was really Kira.

15
00:02:23,748 --> 00:02:27,109
Plus, I managed to convince him that I'm the second Kira.

16
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,888
If I didn't say this now,

17
00:02:28,913 --> 00:02:31,566
I'd probably end up contradicting my story later.

18
00:02:32,222 --> 00:02:34,161
Misa. You idiot!

19
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:36,007
Didn't I tell you to deny all that?

20
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:38,752
But... But now we know Higuchi's Kira, right?

21
00:02:38,777 --> 00:02:41,243
So what's the problem? Can't we just catch him?

22
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:45,333
I suppose this is what you would
call a victory, right Matsuda?

23
00:02:46,823 --> 00:02:50,343
But right now, we still don't know
exactly how he kills his victims, do we?

24
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:52,244
Yes. That's what I was thinking.

25
00:02:52,712 --> 00:02:55,012
Before we move to arrest Higuchi,

26
00:02:55,123 --> 00:02:57,274
I want to find out how he kills people.

27
00:02:57,748 --> 00:03:00,695
If the criminals stop dying, we
won't be able to figure it out,

28
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,243
unless we come up with another idea.

29
00:03:02,268 --> 00:03:03,130
Isn't that right?

30
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:04,438
Yes.

31
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,728
At any rate, even if we do arrest Higuchi,

32
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:10,534
we're not going to do it until we're
certain that criminals have stopped dying.

33
00:03:11,202 --> 00:03:13,074
Let me think about this for a moment.

34
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:15,737
Weddy.

35
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:16,792
Yeah.

36
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:19,192
An update on the current situation, please.

37
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:21,041
Everything's going smoothly.

38
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:25,954
We should be able to track 70% of their movements
using our cameras inside the office building.

39
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:28,103
What about outside the office?

40
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:31,031
That's not gonna be possible with just Watari and me.

41
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:33,734
What if you focus solely on Higuchi?

42
00:03:34,156 --> 00:03:35,050
Higuchi?

43
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,143
I've only been able to enter the
houses of five of the men so far,

44
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:43,529
but Mido, Namikawa, and Higuchi all
have super high tech security systems,

45
00:03:43,785 --> 00:03:45,140
especially Higuchi.

46
00:03:45,313 --> 00:03:48,969
He recently constructed a dampening
room that shuts out any electronic waves.

47
00:03:49,043 --> 00:03:51,250
It took me two days just to break into the place.

48
00:03:51,445 --> 00:03:53,644
This guy sure does sound suspicious.

49
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:54,286
Hm.

50
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:59,882
All right. Then begin installing microphones,
trackers, and cameras, but not in the house.

51
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,240
Instead, just put them in every car.

52
00:04:02,312 --> 00:04:02,946
What?

53
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:04,481
After getting this far?

54
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,738
Do you know how difficult it
is to break into someone's house?

55
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:10,681
Besides, do you have any idea
of how many cars this guy has?

56
00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:11,923
He has six.

57
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:13,518
Fine then.

58
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:16,420
I just have to install them in all his cars, right?

59
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:18,450
Yes, thank you.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,682
If Higuchi had been bugged earlier,
I would have been in big trouble.

61
00:04:29,694 --> 00:04:30,421
Light.

62
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:33,832
I'm sorry to keep coming back to this topic.

63
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:36,195
I'll just get right to the point.

64
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:36,991
What is it?

65
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:39,053
Do you remember?

66
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,279
Killing anyone, I mean?

67
00:04:41,304 --> 00:04:41,788
Huh?

68
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:45,513
Are you still going on about that?

69
00:04:45,674 --> 00:04:47,152
Look, I'm not Kira!

70
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:48,043
How many times do I...

71
00:04:48,068 --> 00:04:50,163
I just want you to answer the question.

72
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,578
Well, do you remember?

73
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,592
No, I don't.

74
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:56,763
Miso, what about you?

75
00:04:56,945 --> 00:04:58,282
I don't remember.

76
00:04:58,397 --> 00:05:00,568
How could I, 'cause I'm not Kira.

77
00:05:02,012 --> 00:05:02,772
Look, Light.

78
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:05,268
Please listen to what I'm about to say.

79
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:08,735
I'd like you to thoroughly analyze my current theory.

80
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,825
This could determine the way
in which we end up catching Kira.

81
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,057
Light Yagami used to be Kira.

82
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:21,373
Kira's power has somehow passed onto another person.

83
00:05:21,398 --> 00:05:24,894
Light Yagami now has no memory of ever being Kira.

84
00:05:25,568 --> 00:05:28,145
I need your analysis based on these assumptions.

85
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,515
Do you think you can do that for me?

86
00:05:31,335 --> 00:05:33,132
Yeah. I'll give it a try.

87
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:37,377
Light Yagami used to be Kira.

88
00:05:37,402 --> 00:05:40,666
Kira's power has somehow passed onto another person.

89
00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:43,079
Was that because Light Yagami wanted it to happen,

90
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:45,450
or was there someone else in control of Light,

91
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:48,350
lurking in the background, who gave him the power?

92
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:52,267
Was it that person who passed
Light's powers to someone else?

93
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:08,935
Given your premise, it would be my will.

94
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:14,458
Yes, of course.

95
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,186
If there is a third party with the
ability to bestow or transfer Kira's power

96
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:21,277
and they didn't want their method to be discovered,

97
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:25,730
it makes no sense that they would wait so
long to transfer it from you to the next Kira.

98
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:30,140
If we believe that this was the work
of some being watching us from above,

99
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:32,930
then we'd have to accept that
they are impossible to catch,

100
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:35,558
not to mention I'd already be dead.

101
00:06:35,757 --> 00:06:41,299
Or at the very least, I'm being made to be a fool
by eternally dancing in the palm of someone's hand.

102
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,729
It's highly unlikely that such a being exists.

103
00:06:47,212 --> 00:06:49,887
Even if Light Yagami was Kira,

104
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:55,996
Kira's power can be transferred by
the will of the person who possesses it.

105
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:57,763
Thank you, Light.

106
00:06:58,091 --> 00:07:01,321
I can now say that I feel 99% better.

107
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:16,459
We'll create a situation where Higuchi won't
be able to pass off his power to anyone else.

108
00:07:16,484 --> 00:07:18,263
We'll have him show us how he kills.

109
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:20,111
So, what are you gonna do?

110
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,794
I'm going to trick Higuchi using Sakura TV.

111
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:24,158
Like a hidden camera show!

112
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:24,637
What?

113
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,902
We'll use the Kira Special that Demegawa airs every week.

114
00:07:28,956 --> 00:07:30,865
We'll book a three hour time slot.

115
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:35,231
It'll be announced that Kira's identity
will be revealed near the end of the special.

116
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,901
Would anyone actually buy that, though?

117
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:40,125
This is Sakura TV after all.

118
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,007
For all we know, Higuchi might
not even watch that program.

119
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,196
We'll get Namikawa to call him and say,

120
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:48,572
"This is bad. Turn on your TV."

121
00:07:48,804 --> 00:07:50,540
That should be enough to get him watching.

122
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:53,256
Higuchi will buy it once he realizes

123
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:56,306
that the special guest on TV
is someone who knows his secret.

124
00:07:57,001 --> 00:07:58,101
Oh, I get it.

125
00:07:58,126 --> 00:07:59,808
So we'll be using Aiber, then.

126
00:07:59,984 --> 00:08:02,377
He'll reveal that he was a spy all along!

127
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:04,601
No, I'm afraid you're incorrect.

128
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,482
We will not be using Aiber.

129
00:08:08,645 --> 00:08:10,492
Whoever appears on the show...

130
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,420
has to be someone who Higuchi
believes he'll be able to kill.

131
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:18,101
In other words, it has to be someone...

132
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:20,693
whose name he can look up easily.

133
00:08:21,023 --> 00:08:23,601
But we're never going to find a person like that, are we?

134
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:24,832
Hm.

135
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,897
You're the only one who can do it.

136
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:27,929
Matsu!

137
00:08:28,212 --> 00:08:29,412
Matsu?

138
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:32,169
Higuchi probably thinks that you
were listening in on their meeting

139
00:08:32,194 --> 00:08:34,094
and overheard their plan to kill people.

140
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:38,039
It would make sense that Misa's manager who he
thought was dead is the one revealing his secret.

141
00:08:38,122 --> 00:08:39,074
That's right.

142
00:08:39,396 --> 00:08:44,202
We'll have Sakura TV use a voice filter
and frosted glass to protect your identity.

143
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,274
Higuchi will probably realize from the announcement

144
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:49,858
and the silhouette that it's the manager, Taro Matsui.

145
00:08:49,883 --> 00:08:52,266
And just to make sure, we'll have the studio mess up

146
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:55,565
and accidentally reveal your
face from behind the frosted glass.

147
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,521
Wow! That sounds exciting!

148
00:08:57,711 --> 00:09:01,954
Until the show ends, the announcer will
keep saying they'll reveal the full name of H,

149
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:03,073
who's acting as Kira.

150
00:09:03,191 --> 00:09:04,659
Higuchi would feel cornered.

151
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:07,978
He'd have no choice but to find out
the manager's name as soon as possible.

152
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:11,134
We can anticipate what actions he'll take.

153
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,998
We'll witness his killing method.

154
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,808
After that, we arrest him.

155
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:20,347
There is one potential problem with this plan.

156
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,501
If Higuchi can kill by simply looking at someone's face,

157
00:09:23,526 --> 00:09:27,811
just like the second Kira, Matsuda will die.

158
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:32,079
But, considering the fact that you're still alive,

159
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:35,394
and how he's pursuing Misa, I doubt that's the case.

160
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:38,613
At any rate, we're only going to
do this once criminals stop dying.

161
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:41,723
We'll have to wait for two or three
days to see whether or not that happens.

162
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:46,096
In the meantime, Matsuda will have to
decide if he wants to go through with this plan.

163
00:09:53,656 --> 00:09:55,909
I don't need two or three days to decide.

164
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:58,640
I want to do this.

165
00:10:18,507 --> 00:10:19,391
Well, I'm here.

166
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,918
What's with this private meeting?

167
00:10:21,646 --> 00:10:22,679
Namikawa.

168
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,593
Tell me, who do you think is Kira?

169
00:10:25,342 --> 00:10:27,691
Ha. Why do you want to know what I think?

170
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,992
Besides, for all I know, it could be you, Shimura.

171
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:33,244
Or maybe even Mido.

172
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:35,158
Shimura can't be Kira.

173
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:39,590
He was the one who came crying to me about
how he can't go along with Kira's crimes anymore.

174
00:10:39,713 --> 00:10:40,463
Really?

175
00:10:40,587 --> 00:10:43,481
But if Mido had turned out to be
Kira, you would have been killed.

176
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:44,462
No.

177
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,541
You and Mido would have been successful on your own.

178
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,226
There's no way either of you would
need to hold those stupid meetings.

179
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:53,031
Let alone with seven others.

180
00:10:53,056 --> 00:10:54,528
I can at least see that much.

181
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:58,189
We're all cooperating with these killings
because we're afraid of Kira turning on us.

182
00:10:58,402 --> 00:11:00,413
I mean, it's only a matter of time

183
00:11:00,712 --> 00:11:02,361
until the public finds out.

184
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,604
And this isn't going to stop until that happens.

185
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,662
So, Shimura, let me ask you, then,

186
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:10,601
who do you think Kira might be?

187
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,371
Takahasi or Higuchi.

188
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,858
No. Takahashi is just a decoy.

189
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,465
Kira would make sure there
are people less clever than him.

190
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:23,271
Well, then, it looks like we all know the truth already.

191
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:25,882
It's Higuchi, isn't it?

192
00:11:25,907 --> 00:11:26,612
Yes.

193
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,845
He's the one who's the most
obsessed with money and success.

194
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,488
He might always act as if he's
not interested in those things,

195
00:11:33,564 --> 00:11:35,361
but that just proves it all the more.

196
00:11:35,777 --> 00:11:39,672
And he always insults everyone around
him, and can't use his people well.

197
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:44,285
I believe that's why he was demoted from
being head of the development department.

198
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,530
By the way, I meant to ask was
I the only one you invited here?

199
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:49,517
I also invited Ooi, but...

200
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,069
he said you can hold your stupid
private meetings by yourself.

201
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:54,150
Go figure.

202
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:56,846
Heh. Good old Ooi, always the blunt one.

203
00:11:57,155 --> 00:12:00,022
We can also rule out Kida as a possible suspect,

204
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:03,934
as he was the one who provided the
account for funds in order to commission Coil.

205
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:05,234
Namikawa.

206
00:12:05,413 --> 00:12:07,700
During that first meeting after Hatori died,

207
00:12:07,908 --> 00:12:09,457
you got a call on your cell phone.

208
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,561
I was wondering who it was from.

209
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:14,659
You know, Shimura, you really are a sharp one.

210
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,951
Kira probably selected you
because he appreciates your caution.

211
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:22,890
Hm.

212
00:12:25,866 --> 00:12:27,026
Namikawa speaking.

213
00:12:27,051 --> 00:12:30,578
It's L. Before I go on, are you by yourself?

214
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:31,818
No.

215
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:34,013
Then just act like it's a normal call again.

216
00:12:34,038 --> 00:12:35,353
I don't think there's any need for that.

217
00:12:35,566 --> 00:12:40,414
One of the people here with me was just
expressing his suspicions about your last phone call.

218
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:42,403
Who is that on the line? Namikawa?

219
00:12:43,378 --> 00:12:44,557
It's L.

220
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:50,464
L, Mido and Shimura are here as well.

221
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:52,944
I'm reasonable certain that neither of them are Kira.

222
00:12:52,969 --> 00:12:55,335
In fact, they seem fed up with it at this point.

223
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,366
I'll speak for them and say they'll choose to
stand back and watch your face-off with Kira,

224
00:12:59,391 --> 00:13:00,639
like I plan to.

225
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:02,621
That's fine.

226
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,846
Tonight, I'm gonna catch Kira.

227
00:13:05,176 --> 00:13:07,082
But I'll need a favor from you.

228
00:13:07,184 --> 00:13:07,840
Hm?

229
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,346
Then it's the end for Higuchi.

230
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:12,903
What? You know that it's him?

231
00:13:13,288 --> 00:13:13,873
Ha!

232
00:13:14,355 --> 00:13:16,278
So even the great L can be tricked.

233
00:13:16,788 --> 00:13:21,151
Based on your reaction, I'm now
100% certain that Higuchi is Kira.

234
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,885
Namikawa's pretty smart, huh?

235
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,393
But then, I always thought he
was, from looking at his face.

236
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:27,503
I guess this proves it.

237
00:13:27,528 --> 00:13:28,237
No.

238
00:13:28,262 --> 00:13:30,124
That was just because Light messed up.

239
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:34,600
I'm baiting Higuchi with a staged TV special tonight.

240
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,698
Sakura TV.

241
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:37,785
A few minutes into the program,

242
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,838
I want you to contact Higuchi, tell him to tune in.

243
00:13:40,911 --> 00:13:44,725
Do that for me, and I won't go
after you, or any of the other five.

244
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:47,956
As for the others, Kida, Takahasi, and Ooi,

245
00:13:48,021 --> 00:13:50,932
if they try to do anything, make sure to stop them.

246
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:52,238
All right. I understand.

247
00:13:55,806 --> 00:13:57,730
It seems it really was Higuchi.

248
00:13:58,466 --> 00:14:00,804
He'll be captured tonight. Apparently.

249
00:14:04,494 --> 00:14:07,423
It's been about three days
since I stopped killing criminals.

250
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:09,042
That should be good enough, shouldn't it?

251
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,865
Now, when I marry Misa Amane, the second Kira,

252
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,726
I'll have the Shinigami eyes.

253
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:21,163
With that power in my hands,
Yotsuba will be under my control.

254
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:31,839
Higuchi, we've got a problem. Turn on the television.

255
00:14:31,864 --> 00:14:33,361
Check out Sakura TV.

256
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,336
Hm?

257
00:14:35,705 --> 00:14:38,451
So you're saying one of those people is Kira, right?

258
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:39,452
Yes.

259
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,860
I've got a lot of evidence to prove it, too.

260
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:43,178
What the hell is this?

261
00:14:43,203 --> 00:14:46,022
Come in, it's probably a hoax. This is Sakura TV.

262
00:14:46,182 --> 00:14:47,541
No, it's more than that.

263
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:49,987
At the beginning of the show he
said that he overheard a meeting...

264
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:51,471
between eight people.

265
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:54,839
What? Someone who knows about the meetings?

266
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:57,079
Who is it? Did someone betray us?

267
00:14:57,478 --> 00:14:59,185
Then one of them was killed by Kira,

268
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,864
and now there are only seven left.

269
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:03,108
The man who died was Mr. H.

270
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:04,117
Mr. H?

271
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,270
Hatori.

272
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,318
If he knows this much, he could be one of the other six.

273
00:15:08,822 --> 00:15:10,099
No, maybe it's Coil.

274
00:15:10,466 --> 00:15:14,165
Mr. H wanted to leave the meetings,
and was killed by Kira because of that.

275
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:16,833
No, it can't be any of the others.

276
00:15:16,858 --> 00:15:18,946
There's no benefit for them to do this.

277
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,294
But no one else knows about the meetings, do they?

278
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:22,544
Dammit, who is it?

279
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,077
What? Wait.

280
00:15:24,611 --> 00:15:25,765
Could it be...

281
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,661
Huh? Oh!

282
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:29,759
Ah!

283
00:15:29,784 --> 00:15:31,484
It's... It's him!

284
00:15:32,143 --> 00:15:34,503
Cover him up! Cover him up!

285
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,376
It's Misa's manager.

286
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,917
Matsui. That's his name.

287
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:39,384
Why is he still alive?

288
00:15:42,222 --> 00:15:44,937
He explained earlier that he
thought he was going to be killed.

289
00:15:44,962 --> 00:15:49,676
He pretended to fall out of the apartment
window and escaped to a balcony a few floors below.

290
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:52,237
But that can't be.

291
00:15:52,262 --> 00:15:55,181
Just to be careful, I went home that
night and wrote his name in the notebook

292
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:57,220
like it was written on his business card.

293
00:15:57,245 --> 00:15:58,858
Why is he still alive, then?

294
00:15:58,896 --> 00:16:02,821
Could he be a former entertainer who
became a manager using his stage name?

295
00:16:02,906 --> 00:16:04,441
Is that possible?

296
00:16:04,743 --> 00:16:05,965
If that weren't bad enough,

297
00:16:06,024 --> 00:16:08,937
he said that he continued to
investigate Yotsuba up until now,

298
00:16:08,962 --> 00:16:11,454
and he's figured out which one of us is Kira.

299
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,991
I'm contacting everyone right now to let them now.

300
00:16:14,356 --> 00:16:16,659
All right. We'll talk later.

301
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,944
Sir, we're terribly sorry for that accident.

302
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:20,831
Are you all right?

303
00:16:21,378 --> 00:16:22,789
We can stop, if you want.

304
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:26,266
No. I knew I was gonna be in danger going into this.

305
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,024
This is for the sake of justice,

306
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:30,733
so I'll see it through to the
end, even if it means my death.

307
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:32,433
Yeah, that's perfect.

308
00:16:32,804 --> 00:16:37,302
Listen, just be sure to hold off on the Kira
announcement until the last minute, all right?

309
00:16:38,337 --> 00:16:39,793
I have to kill him!

310
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:41,501
Calm down.

311
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:46,277
Misa knows his face, so if she's the second
Kira, she should know what his real name is.

312
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:52,233
It's him.

313
00:16:54,928 --> 00:16:56,174
Oh, what the hell?

314
00:16:56,489 --> 00:17:00,577
To be honest, I've been debating for a long
time whether or not I should make this announcement.

315
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,870
But now that I'm here, I know I've
done the right thing in coming forward.

316
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:05,747
This is bad.

317
00:17:05,879 --> 00:17:07,493
Who knows then he'll make the announcement?

318
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:09,323
...Kira's identity will be announced soon.

319
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,213
Cosme Misa, a devilish charm.

320
00:17:14,238 --> 00:17:15,786
An angel's glitter.

321
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:19,274
Misa's new line of lipstick, just for you.

322
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:21,322
Mido, it's me.

323
00:17:21,347 --> 00:17:22,913
Are you watching Sakura TV?

324
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:25,248
Why don't you call your father in the House of Counselors?

325
00:17:25,466 --> 00:17:29,508
Have him pull some strings at the Ministry
of Internal Affairs to stop this broadcast.

326
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:31,612
I'm watching, but I don't think we could stop it.

327
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:36,556
No one believes this program, so we'd only
make ourselves look suspicious if we stop it.

328
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,188
Besides, there shouldn't be anything to worry about.

329
00:17:39,552 --> 00:17:41,410
The guy revealed his face earlier.

330
00:17:41,578 --> 00:17:43,858
Everyone knows it's really Taro Matsui.

331
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:48,278
Namikawa's already gone ahead
and told everyone to watch the show.

332
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:53,068
Since one of us seven has to be Kira, that
should mean Taro Matsui will soon be dead.

333
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:53,815
Right?

334
00:17:54,215 --> 00:17:54,970
Of course.

335
00:17:55,107 --> 00:18:00,099
I'm the only one who knows, or even
suspects that Taro Matsui isn't his real name.

336
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:04,583
That means if I say anything,
it'll reveal the fact that I'm Kira.

337
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:08,321
Yeah. It's true.

338
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,755
I'll talk to you later.

339
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,325
Stay tuned to Sakura TV.

340
00:18:12,377 --> 00:18:13,345
Dammit!

341
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:15,864
Ryuzaki.

342
00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:18,774
Mogi is in position in front of Yoshida Productions.

343
00:18:18,913 --> 00:18:20,844
He's just received a call from Higuchi.

344
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:22,638
Yes, it's time for phase two.

345
00:18:22,878 --> 00:18:24,194
Everything's as planned.

346
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:25,777
Moji, where's Misa?

347
00:18:25,802 --> 00:18:28,478
Oh, Mr. Higuchi. Pleasure to hear from you.

348
00:18:28,503 --> 00:18:31,746
I'm sorry, but Misa Misa's taking
a much needed vacation right now.

349
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:34,003
She should be back by, oh, tomorrow morning, though.

350
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:35,056
You can reach her then.

351
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:37,529
I'm asking you where she is now.

352
00:18:37,554 --> 00:18:39,121
Well, that's private information.

353
00:18:39,146 --> 00:18:41,579
She's requested that no one know where she is.

354
00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:42,413
I'm very sorry.

355
00:18:42,438 --> 00:18:44,811
I'll have her contact you tomorrow, first thing.

356
00:18:45,143 --> 00:18:47,025
Damn! I know his face.

357
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,846
I could kill him at any time, if only I knew his name.

358
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,260
Do you know if Misa's former manager
was an entertainer at some point?

359
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:55,013
Come again?

360
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:57,340
I'm talking about Taro Matsui!

361
00:18:57,365 --> 00:18:58,519
Oh.

362
00:18:58,544 --> 00:19:01,252
I was only recently hired, so I don't know much about him.

363
00:19:01,277 --> 00:19:04,072
If you need some information, I can
let you talk to someone from the office.

364
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,440
I just remembered.

365
00:19:05,472 --> 00:19:07,132
Everyone's in Okinawa at the moment.

366
00:19:07,157 --> 00:19:08,813
You could try calling the president, though.

367
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,256
This is going exactly as I planned.

368
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:12,381
It's almost scary.

369
00:19:12,682 --> 00:19:14,376
You shouldn't be scared, Light.

370
00:19:14,408 --> 00:19:15,454
You should be happy.

371
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:19,381
I'm patching you in to Higuchi's call
with the president of Yoshida Productions.

372
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,235
This is Higuchi from Yotsuba.

373
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:23,652
That manager's real name isn't Taro Matsui, is it?

374
00:19:23,677 --> 00:19:26,874
He's not even pretending to hide
what he's asking about now, is he?

375
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:27,958
Stupid Higuchi.

376
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:30,972
If he's acting like that, it's
proof he's beginning to panic.

377
00:19:30,997 --> 00:19:32,394
Then what was his real name?

378
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:33,616
I think it Yamada.

379
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:35,071
No. Wait.

380
00:19:35,178 --> 00:19:36,278
Yamashida.

381
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:39,767
And his first name was, I'm sorry, I can't remember.

382
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,125
Don't screw with me!

383
00:19:41,177 --> 00:19:44,236
Why the hell can't you remember
the names of the people you hire!?

384
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:45,632
All right.

385
00:19:45,657 --> 00:19:47,424
No need for that kind of language.

386
00:19:47,449 --> 00:19:49,613
I've got his personnel file back at the office.

387
00:19:49,638 --> 00:19:51,806
Then go back there and get it.

388
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:53,210
You gotta be kidding me.

389
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:54,533
Give me a break.

390
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,541
We're on our first company vacation in two years!

391
00:19:57,777 --> 00:19:59,526
If you wanna know that badly,

392
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:01,597
I'll give you the pin code for the office lock.

393
00:20:01,622 --> 00:20:04,136
You can go in yourself and look it up. How's that?

394
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,197
The personnel files are in the
desk in the back to the left.

395
00:20:07,402 --> 00:20:09,202
You'll find them filed in the bottom drawer.

396
00:20:09,227 --> 00:20:11,638
They should all be sorted alphabetically.

397
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:14,233
But I'm pretty sure it was Yamashida.

398
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,008
If they're going to announce it at the end of the program,

399
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:18,836
that means I have two hours.

400
00:20:22,983 --> 00:20:24,512
So what's he gonna do?

401
00:20:44,306 --> 00:20:45,539
I see Higuchi.

402
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:47,440
He's only carrying a single bag.

403
00:20:47,517 --> 00:20:48,552
I'm in pursuit.

404
00:20:51,354 --> 00:20:53,758
Everything's still going according to plan.

405
00:20:53,896 --> 00:20:54,747
Yes.

406
00:20:59,714 --> 00:21:00,527
I'll kill him.

407
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:02,211
I'll kill him no matter what.

408
00:21:02,236 --> 00:21:04,628
I've come this far. I won't let them stop me.

409
00:21:04,694 --> 00:21:07,573
I'm not giving up until I have everything.

410
00:22:35,023 --> 00:22:37,460
With these eyes, I'm invincible!

411
00:22:37,485 --> 00:22:38,894
Higuchi has a gun on him!

412
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:39,391
The chief has been shot.

413
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:40,438
This isn't sounding very good.

414
00:22:40,463 --> 00:22:41,642
Higuchi. Hold it right there.

415
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:44,886
With this show, I'm gonna have 100% ratings for sure!

416
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,622
I made it in time.
