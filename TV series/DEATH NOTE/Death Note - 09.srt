1
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,894
I can't believe my son is looking at those magazines.

2
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:34,352
Hey, Light!

3
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,611
Come on!

4
00:01:35,636 --> 00:01:37,569
Dinner's ready.

5
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:48,871
I'll solve equations with my right
hand and write names with my left.

6
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:54,237
I'll take a potato chipand eat it!

7
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:58,471
And the witness to my alibi is L himself.

8
00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:05,697
Are you sure about this? Ryuk.

9
00:02:05,722 --> 00:02:08,604
Yeah, I'm sure nobody's following you, OK?

10
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,158
Now hurry up already, will you?

11
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:13,816
The symptoms are getting worse.

12
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:18,006
I really hope you're not saying what you
think I'd want to hear just to get some apples.

13
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:19,500
Whoa! Hold it right there.

14
00:02:19,525 --> 00:02:23,578
I just flew out and checked a 100-meter
radius around you, and there was no one there.

15
00:02:23,603 --> 00:02:26,079
So yeah, for the last time, I'm sure. OK?

16
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:26,787
All right.

17
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:30,965
But on the news, they said they were
dispatching 1,500 investigators to Japan.

18
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,124
They're bluffing.

19
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:33,500
You said so yourself.

20
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:35,737
If it were really happening, they
wouldn't announce their arrival.

21
00:02:35,762 --> 00:02:38,428
Instead, they'd come and investigate secretly.

22
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:40,563
I suppose you're right.

23
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:42,747
Well, then, I'll buy you some apples.

24
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:43,738
Nice.

25
00:02:45,194 --> 00:02:47,291
Here you are. Please come again.

26
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:49,767
Light, come on. Hurry up.

27
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,380
You know, you really haven't been that nice to me.

28
00:03:03,104 --> 00:03:05,444
You have me looking all over for cameras,

29
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:07,887
telling me that I can't even
eat apples in the house anymore.

30
00:03:07,912 --> 00:03:09,114
It's not right.

31
00:03:10,713 --> 00:03:13,140
Make sure you eat the core as well.

32
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:20,601
You know, I might actually write your name
in my Death Note and kill you, just like that.

33
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:23,486
I wouldn't laugh if I were you.

34
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:24,149
Right.

35
00:03:24,174 --> 00:03:27,215
That reminds me, I've got one finishing touch left to add.

36
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,031
Hmm. Hey, Ryuzaki.

37
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,099
Yes?

38
00:03:32,165 --> 00:03:36,160
I've been thinking about the purse snatcher
and the embezzler's heart attacks two days ago.

39
00:03:36,192 --> 00:03:40,092
It seems my family couldn't have had
any knowledge of them before they died.

40
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,282
Shouldn't that resolve any doubts you have?

41
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:43,895
You may be right.

42
00:03:44,118 --> 00:03:46,880
Even though Kira can control the time of death,

43
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:51,708
I don't think there's any way he could have arranged
their deaths without having seen the broadcast first.

44
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:52,232
Hmm?

45
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,180
Your son has come home.

46
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,688
Huh.

47
00:04:00,446 --> 00:04:01,146
Heh.

48
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,579
So you're going to keep quiet
and pretend to study again, huh?

49
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:09,283
I have a good grasp of where all the cameras are placed,

50
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:14,412
but I only managed to kill a purse snatcher and
an embezzler using that trick with the potato chips.

51
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:19,251
Both of them were guilty of much
lesser crimes than my previous victims.

52
00:04:19,276 --> 00:04:20,148
Next, in local news...

53
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:20,748
Huh?

54
00:04:20,773 --> 00:04:22,084
You're watching TV?

55
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:26,337
I made sure to kill criminals
whose names and faces were broadcast

56
00:04:26,362 --> 00:04:28,825
when I didn't have access to TV or the internet.

57
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:31,210
But there's a chance I'll look even more suspicious

58
00:04:31,235 --> 00:04:35,166
if only these lesser criminals end up
dying while I'm not receiving information.

59
00:04:35,295 --> 00:04:40,877
In other words, if I kill other petty criminals
whose names and faces are broadcast as I watch TV,

60
00:04:40,902 --> 00:04:43,841
I won't draw unnecessary attention to myself.

61
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:48,366
For this to work, all I really have to do
is remember the identities of the criminals

62
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:50,857
I either see on TV or while I'm online,

63
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:53,402
regardless of the severity of their crimes.

64
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,859
That way, whenever I go out,

65
00:04:55,884 --> 00:05:00,630
I can use that piece of the Death Note I
keep in my wallet to kill them at random times.

66
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,143
Just like that.

67
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:05,641
It's the perfect way to deal with these hidden cameras.

68
00:05:09,218 --> 00:05:10,672
In the past few days,

69
00:05:10,697 --> 00:05:13,444
I've listened to all of our audio recordings

70
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:15,521
and reviewed the video footage we captured.

71
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:17,744
I've gone over them many times.

72
00:05:17,898 --> 00:05:19,585
And I've come to a conclusion.

73
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,794
Our surveillance of the Kitamura
and Yagami households has revealed...

74
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:26,511
nothing.

75
00:05:28,803 --> 00:05:31,136
We will remove the cameras and wiretaps.

76
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,165
All that, and we still don't have any suspects.

77
00:05:35,722 --> 00:05:36,860
It's OK, Matsuda.

78
00:05:36,885 --> 00:05:39,196
We'll have to pursue other leads, but we'll get him.

79
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,963
Please don't get the wrong idea.

80
00:05:40,988 --> 00:05:41,591
Huh?

81
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,133
I only said that we were unable
to reveal anything suspicious

82
00:05:46,158 --> 00:05:47,502
based on our surveillance.

83
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:48,302
What?

84
00:05:48,685 --> 00:05:50,822
Even if Kira was among them,

85
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,724
I'm sure he wouldn't make it obvious.

86
00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:59,100
No, in fact, it could mean he was able to continue
killing without doing anything outwardly suspicious.

87
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,927
Well, then you believe that Kira
is among one of those families.

88
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:08,617
As I've said, there's a 5% chance.

89
00:06:12,136 --> 00:06:17,027
Kira never stopped killing people, even
while the surveillance cameras were in place.

90
00:06:18,332 --> 00:06:21,544
I still have no idea how he's
been able to commit these murders,

91
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:26,590
but... let's say he could kill someone
simply by wishing death upon them.

92
00:06:26,772 --> 00:06:29,585
You'd think that any human being
would have shown at least some emotion,

93
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,893
some sign that they were knowingly
committing an act of murder.

94
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:37,381
So the obvious conclusion is
that Kira couldn't be one of them.

95
00:06:37,955 --> 00:06:42,166
However, what if he is one of
these people we've been watching?

96
00:06:42,613 --> 00:06:46,747
If he is, we have to assume that his
psyche has reached godlike proportions,

97
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:50,076
punishing evildoers without the
slightest change of expression.

98
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:52,715
It almost makes me want to
believe that Kira doesn't exist,

99
00:06:52,831 --> 00:06:55,324
that this is just the wrath of a vengeful god.

100
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,423
But that idea is completely absurd,

101
00:06:58,448 --> 00:07:02,325
to think that God would need a
person's face and name to kill them.

102
00:07:02,892 --> 00:07:05,203
No, these aren't acts of God,

103
00:07:05,814 --> 00:07:09,947
but someone very childish and immature
who wants to pretend they're God.

104
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,691
That's what's going on here.

105
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,216
A mass murderer who calls himself Kira exists somewhere,

106
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:18,247
I'm sure of it. And I will catch him.

107
00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:21,736
But I can't count on Kira making any mistakes.

108
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:23,466
It doesn't matter how long we watch him.

109
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:25,755
He's not going to expose himself to us.

110
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:27,948
So what should I do?

111
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,894
Ideally, I ought to get to know him well enough

112
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,932
that he'd admit to me that he
was Kira and show me how he kills.

113
00:07:36,163 --> 00:07:37,819
Would that even be possible?

114
00:07:45,337 --> 00:07:46,162
Hey, Light.

115
00:07:46,187 --> 00:07:49,220
I just checked, and all the cameras have been removed.

116
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:51,518
All of them, every single one.

117
00:07:51,994 --> 00:07:53,091
Hello?

118
00:07:53,116 --> 00:07:54,496
Are you listening to me?

119
00:07:56,773 --> 00:07:58,262
Hey, Light.

120
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:01,352
Oh, good point.

121
00:08:01,377 --> 00:08:04,659
We still don't know if they've
removed all the wiretaps from the house.

122
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,054
I suppose this means I'm no longer a suspect.

123
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,398
Everything's going as planned.

124
00:08:10,642 --> 00:08:13,409
But I'm sure L won't give up that easily.

125
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:15,905
If he's still working with the Japanese police,

126
00:08:16,364 --> 00:08:20,595
chances are my father is working
with him, or under him, anyway.

127
00:08:20,956 --> 00:08:27,473
If that's the case, I'll have to use my father to
find out L's true identity, and I"ll eliminate him.

128
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:38,887
Once I get rid of L, Kira will be one step
closer to becoming the god of the new world.

129
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,447
Light, hurry up.

130
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:43,943
You don't want to be late.

131
00:08:44,297 --> 00:08:45,214
Do your best.

132
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:46,849
I know you don't need it, but good luck.

133
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:50,675
I really don't see why you two are
making such a big deal out of this.

134
00:08:55,238 --> 00:08:56,133
I'm relieved.

135
00:08:56,158 --> 00:08:59,125
We don't have to deal with wiretaps in the house anymore.

136
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,795
Well, it's nice to know that one cause
of stress was resolved before my exam.

137
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,536
And once I get into university,

138
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:06,898
I'll have a lot more room to act as Kira.

139
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:10,051
Then I can focus on finding out who L really is.

140
00:09:10,712 --> 00:09:11,485
You there.

141
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,776
The exam will be starting in 10
minutes, so you better hurry up.

142
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,377
It's fine.

143
00:09:16,402 --> 00:09:18,822
I planned to get here three minutes before the test.

144
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,788
I hate waiting.

145
00:09:19,813 --> 00:09:21,154
I'm here too early.

146
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:23,347
Well, well. Confident.

147
00:09:28,594 --> 00:09:29,916
And begin.

148
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:37,720
Hmm?

149
00:09:48,012 --> 00:09:50,734
You there, student number 162.

150
00:09:50,897 --> 00:09:52,415
Sit properly in your chair.

151
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:53,653
Hmm?

152
00:10:39,236 --> 00:10:43,686
It seems like a lot of Shinigami
are observing the human world lately.

153
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:45,377
Uh, what's with that, anyway?

154
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:48,686
It turns out that Ryuk is being kept by a human.

155
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:51,094
Ha, what's he thinking?

156
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:52,051
Seriously.

157
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:55,342
He's a disgrace to the pride of the Shigiami.

158
00:10:55,469 --> 00:10:59,019
No, I'm talking about the human who's keeping Ryuk.

159
00:10:59,044 --> 00:10:59,712
Huh?

160
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:01,866
Who would want him as a pet?

161
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:04,285
Aren't pets supposed to be cute?

162
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:07,319
When you're right, you're right.

163
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:09,956
So what's the story on this human, anyway?

164
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:11,931
Is it a male or a female?

165
00:11:11,956 --> 00:11:13,051
Who knows?

166
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:16,241
In that case, I think I'd better go take a closer look.

167
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:17,508
Oh boy.

168
00:11:46,984 --> 00:11:48,923
You're a college student now.

169
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:50,497
That's kind of exciting.

170
00:11:50,522 --> 00:11:52,227
I'm filled with joy.

171
00:11:57,355 --> 00:12:02,763
Now for the freshman address,
freshman representative Light Yagami.

172
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,096
Yes.

173
00:12:04,469 --> 00:12:06,195
Ooh. Wow.

174
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,334
And freshman representative Hideki Ryuga.

175
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:11,788
Oh, uh, here.

176
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:14,067
Is that Hideki Ryuga, the pop idol?

177
00:12:14,092 --> 00:12:14,982
That guy?

178
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:18,037
There's no way he's got the brains
to get into a school like To-Oh.

179
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:19,957
Yeah, you're right.

180
00:12:19,982 --> 00:12:22,782
He doesn't look anything like the real Hideki Ryuga.

181
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:29,037
I knew I'd be giving the address with one other student.

182
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:31,075
But I never expected this.

183
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:34,170
I remember him from the exam center.

184
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:37,343
He got into trouble for sitting oddly on his desk.

185
00:12:37,712 --> 00:12:40,366
It seemed like he was off in his own world.

186
00:12:44,869 --> 00:12:47,629
As all of us embark on this new chapter of our lives...

187
00:12:47,654 --> 00:12:51,589
The student who scores highest on the
test is supposed to give the speech, right?

188
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:54,017
I guess both of them must have
had the high score this year.

189
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,107
I heard they both had perfect scores for all subjects.

190
00:12:57,132 --> 00:12:57,936
Seriously?

191
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,439
It's hard to believe there are actually people like that.

192
00:13:01,136 --> 00:13:03,096
I think I like the little one on the right.

193
00:13:03,288 --> 00:13:05,786
What? You're so weird, Kyoko.

194
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:07,261
Look at how he's dressed.

195
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,017
Mmm.

196
00:13:12,774 --> 00:13:15,761
Man, these two are total opposites.

197
00:13:15,786 --> 00:13:16,643
Yeah.

198
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:21,422
This one looks like a sheltered genius
who's been groomed for success his whole life.

199
00:13:21,602 --> 00:13:22,533
But the other one.

200
00:13:22,597 --> 00:13:25,444
As we embark on this new chapter in our lives...

201
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:26,954
There's something not right about him.

202
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:28,553
He's just freaking weird.

203
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:31,539
This guy must be what they call a mad genius.

204
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,973
Coming to the To-Oh entrance ceremony dressed like that?

205
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,169
Unbelievable.

206
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,886
Either he's crazy, or he's just toying with us.

207
00:13:38,957 --> 00:13:41,345
...your freshman representative, Hideki Ryuga.

208
00:13:52,388 --> 00:13:53,083
Light.

209
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,328
Light Yagami?

210
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:58,955
Your father is Cheif Soichori Yagami of the NPA.

211
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,647
Your respect for your father is matched
only by your strong sense of justice.

212
00:14:02,817 --> 00:14:04,572
Who the hell is this guy?

213
00:14:04,873 --> 00:14:08,107
You're planning to join the
police agency when you graduate.

214
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:12,761
And you've already got experience, seeing as you've
helped the police solve a number of cases in the past.

215
00:14:12,955 --> 00:14:15,756
Now you're showing an interest in the Kira case.

216
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:19,910
I'm impressed by your abilities and your sense of justice.

217
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:24,258
If you promise not to tell anyone about
this, I have important information concerning

218
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:27,351
the Kira investigation that I'd like to share with you.

219
00:14:27,571 --> 00:14:29,349
Where's this coming from?

220
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:30,892
And who is he?

221
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:33,040
Is it safe to just ignore him?

222
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:36,547
But I wonder what this information actually is.

223
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:39,633
I won't tell anyone. What is it?

224
00:14:44,913 --> 00:14:46,525
I want to tell you I'm L.

225
00:14:51,254 --> 00:14:52,319
What?

226
00:14:52,932 --> 00:14:54,272
There's no way!

227
00:14:54,331 --> 00:14:55,969
What's he talking about?

228
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:58,902
If he really was L, he'd never admit to it.

229
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:03,374
I thought this guy was a bit
strange, but this is pretty extreme.

230
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,215
Stop.

231
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:06,717
This isn't good.

232
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,638
Don't act surprised.

233
00:15:09,107 --> 00:15:11,602
On the off chance that he really is L,

234
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:14,059
I have to act how Soichiro Yagami's son,

235
00:15:14,084 --> 00:15:16,219
Light Yagami, would act in this situation.

236
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:18,615
There'd be no reason for him to be afraid.

237
00:15:19,474 --> 00:15:24,108
If you are who you say you are, then you
have nothing but my respect and admiration.

238
00:15:24,385 --> 00:15:25,114
Thank you.

239
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:27,872
The reason I chose to reveal my identity to you

240
00:15:27,897 --> 00:15:31,554
is because I think you could be of
some help to us on the Kira investigation.

241
00:15:32,774 --> 00:15:34,235
Light Yagami.

242
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,974
The likelihood that you are Kira is just under 5%.

243
00:15:38,018 --> 00:15:41,571
Even so, something tells me I'm not wrong to suspect you.

244
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:43,384
But you're just too perfect.

245
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:48,255
If you are Kira, I can't think of anything that
would put more pressure on you than this little scenario.

246
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,071
If this guy is really L like he
says, then consider be impressed.

247
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,278
Indeed.

248
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,205
If this guy really is L, no, even if he's not L.

249
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,711
I... I can't do anything to him.

250
00:16:05,342 --> 00:16:06,196
Huh.

251
00:16:08,273 --> 00:16:09,980
If what he's saying is true,

252
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:13,344
it probably means he's already
shown his face to my father.

253
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:14,737
What now?

254
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:19,724
If he were to die right after telling me who
he was, it would only confirm their suspicions.

255
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:24,835
Although it's obvious Hideki Ryuga
is nothing more than an absurd alias,

256
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,717
it still complicates things.

257
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:29,308
Even if I get lucky and it isn't an alias,

258
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:32,660
if I try to kill him by simply
writing his name in the Death Note,

259
00:16:32,821 --> 00:16:36,175
I might accidentally picture
the face of Ryuga the pop star

260
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:38,290
and end up killing him instead.

261
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,162
And if this guy doesn't die,

262
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:43,329
he'll know for a fact that I'm Kira.

263
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:46,350
Is he really L?

264
00:16:46,555 --> 00:16:48,691
Does he already suspect that I'm Kira?

265
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,446
It's hard to say how much he
knows, but I must be under suspicion.

266
00:16:54,626 --> 00:16:58,826
What other reason could he have for
telling Soichiro Yagami's son that he's L?

267
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:03,805
Does this mean that he's still suspicious of the
people that Raye Penber was investigating before he died?

268
00:17:04,744 --> 00:17:08,660
Even so, I still don't see why he
would reveal himself to me directly.

269
00:17:10,074 --> 00:17:12,422
I can't let him see any signs of distress.

270
00:17:12,804 --> 00:17:15,843
It's better if I just clear my mind.

271
00:17:29,321 --> 00:17:33,668
Ha, I didn't think the ceremony would be so interesting.

272
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,777
Hey, Light.

273
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:41,764
You hear that?

274
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:43,616
I think it's your new friend.

275
00:17:44,336 --> 00:17:45,536
Uh, nice meeting you.

276
00:17:45,587 --> 00:17:47,597
No, the pleasure was mine.

277
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:52,711
What an amazing car.

278
00:17:52,736 --> 00:17:53,749
A limousine?

279
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:56,350
Well, I'm sure I'll see you on campus.

280
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,899
Yeah, take care.

281
00:18:00,585 --> 00:18:03,073
That kid must come from some serious money.

282
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:04,720
Plus he's at the top of the class?

283
00:18:04,745 --> 00:18:05,936
Where's the justice?

284
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:25,640
Huh?

285
00:18:25,817 --> 00:18:28,745
Hey, welcome home, Mr. To-Oh!

286
00:18:36,813 --> 00:18:37,513
Hmm?

287
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:42,878
Damn it! He got me!

288
00:18:42,978 --> 00:18:44,278
Uh, what do you mean?

289
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:46,088
Damn L!

290
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:48,781
I've never been so humiliated in my life.

291
00:18:48,907 --> 00:18:53,041
Uh, hey, why don't you just
do the Shinigami eye deal thing?

292
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:55,437
Then you should have no problem killing him, right?

293
00:18:55,462 --> 00:18:58,786
And what good will Shinigami
eyes do me if this is just a trap?

294
00:18:58,811 --> 00:19:01,055
If I kill him, and it turns out he's not really L,

295
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:04,087
that would be like announcing
to the real L that I am Kira.

296
00:19:04,112 --> 00:19:05,788
Uh, sorry.

297
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:09,136
Don't think that Shinigami killing people

298
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:12,322
and humans killing people are
the same thing, because they're not.

299
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:15,213
I want nothing more than to kill him.

300
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:17,736
But if I do, it's like asking to get caught.

301
00:19:18,112 --> 00:19:22,418
Unfortunately, the Death Note can only
kill the person whose name is written in it,

302
00:19:22,443 --> 00:19:25,446
so it's not like I can arrange
for someone else to kill him.

303
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:26,871
It's inconvenient.

304
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:28,782
That's the flaw with the Death Note.

305
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:32,025
Light is usually so calm, but he's snapped.

306
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,629
This must be getting to him.

307
00:19:33,654 --> 00:19:35,732
At first, I thought once I found out his name,

308
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,460
I'd have him die in an accident or kill himself.

309
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:44,043
However, none of that will do me any good unless
I know with 100% certainty that this guy is L.

310
00:19:44,068 --> 00:19:49,168
No, it's already too late to do anything about it
since he's approached me and introduced himself as L.

311
00:19:49,193 --> 00:19:51,050
It doesn't matter how sure I am.

312
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:55,437
Regardless of the cause of death, if L
dies now, the police are going to suspect me.

313
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:57,340
I underestimated him.

314
00:19:58,016 --> 00:20:03,424
I'd never even considered the possibility that
he would reveal his identity to me on purpose.

315
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:10,311
He could be telling all the suspects the same
thing. In fact, it doesn't even have to be him.

316
00:20:10,393 --> 00:20:12,379
He could have sent a double instead.

317
00:20:12,518 --> 00:20:17,853
For L, this strategy acts as a solid defense,
and it allows him to confront Kira directly.

318
00:20:18,034 --> 00:20:19,667
He can defend and attack.

319
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,053
He got me.

320
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:22,540
It was a good move.

321
00:20:22,977 --> 00:20:25,877
I'm sure I haven't seen the last of Ryuga.

322
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:30,312
He'll keep trying to move in on
me, playing the absentminded genius,

323
00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:33,228
and we'll pretend like nothing's going on.

324
00:20:40,884 --> 00:20:41,776
Huh?

325
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:46,112
This is perfect.

326
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:48,488
There's no reason for me to be worried.

327
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:51,999
After all, this is proof that
they don't have anything on me yet.

328
00:20:52,132 --> 00:20:55,668
So this whole thing is nothing
more than a contest between L and me.

329
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,119
A match of wits.

330
00:20:58,144 --> 00:21:00,795
On the surface, we'll be two friendly classmates.

331
00:21:00,841 --> 00:21:04,747
But in reality, we'll actually
be investigating each other.

332
00:21:05,022 --> 00:21:06,622
This is interesting, Ryuga.

333
00:21:06,647 --> 00:21:09,813
If it's my friendship you want, I'll gladly accept it.

334
00:21:09,921 --> 00:21:11,988
In time, I'll earn your trust.

335
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,634
And once you've told me what I want to know,

336
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,217
there'll be no point keeping you alive.

337
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:20,921
Then I'll kill you, with my hands if I have to.

338
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,324
Hmm.

339
00:22:37,184 --> 00:22:39,968
I don't see any way that Ryuga, or L,

340
00:22:39,993 --> 00:22:42,377
can profile me based on a tennis match.

341
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,336
So I have to assume he has some other goal in mind.

342
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:48,091
Either way, I'm not going to let him win.
