1
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:37,597
I understand.

2
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:41,463
I can't be your boyfriend, but I can act like it.

3
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:46,022
Thank you so much, I'll try
my hardest to make you love me.

4
00:01:46,047 --> 00:01:46,907
I promise.

5
00:01:48,547 --> 00:01:50,509
I'll arrange for her to meet L.

6
00:01:50,717 --> 00:01:52,348
She'll tell me his name,

7
00:01:52,407 --> 00:01:54,996
and then I eliminate the entire task force.

8
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:57,761
And when that's done, I'll kill her, too.

9
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:03,786
After all, she's the only person who
knows Kira's true identity the only one.

10
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:06,271
I can't let her live much longer.

11
00:02:06,698 --> 00:02:08,519
So you'll just pretend?

12
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,782
All right. I guess it's a good start.

13
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,544
Well, now that we talked about that,

14
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:15,466
could you show me your Shinigami?
I really want to see him.

15
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:18,373
I need her to trust me. I guess I have to.

16
00:02:18,682 --> 00:02:19,802
Yeah, sure.

17
00:02:20,065 --> 00:02:21,467
Could you please turn around?

18
00:02:21,564 --> 00:02:22,567
All right.

19
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:31,348
You can turn back now.

20
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:32,289
OK.

21
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:36,079
Hey there. How's it going?

22
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,665
Oh, look at that.

23
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,745
You're a completely different type
of Shinigami than Rem, aren't you?

24
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:43,054
I already know your name. It's Ryuk, right?

25
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,233
Nice to meet you.

26
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:45,937
Yeah. Same here.

27
00:02:46,422 --> 00:02:48,310
Oh, and by the way, Light, darling,

28
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,195
do you know how to kill a Shinigami?

29
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,612
Hm?

30
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:53,066
Did you just call me darling?

31
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:53,789
Fine.

32
00:02:53,864 --> 00:02:56,245
Then do you mind if I call you Knight instead?

33
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:58,681
'Cause you're like my knight in shining armor, you know.

34
00:02:59,197 --> 00:03:00,768
Let's just stick with Light.

35
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:07,175
So, were you actually planning to check all of the
footage we got from Aoyama on the 22nd by yourself?

36
00:03:07,215 --> 00:03:07,895
That's right.

37
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:12,760
I think it's very likely that Kira and the second
Kira make contact with each other there on that day.

38
00:03:12,823 --> 00:03:15,254
So I want to check all of these tapes personally.

39
00:03:15,348 --> 00:03:16,981
Also, Mr. Yagami?

40
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:18,027
Uh, yes?

41
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:22,489
Please ask Mr. Mogi to start following
Light, so we can keep tabs on what he's doing.

42
00:03:22,545 --> 00:03:23,906
You want him followed?

43
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:25,714
It's only a slim chance.

44
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,004
But if you Light is Kira, then there's still a possibility

45
00:03:28,029 --> 00:03:31,885
that the second Kira might try to contact him somehow.

46
00:03:32,248 --> 00:03:33,145
Very well

47
00:03:33,757 --> 00:03:36,420
I'm starting to wonder if Ryuzaki is even human.

48
00:03:36,445 --> 00:03:37,650
The guy never sleeps.

49
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:41,039
I saw him sleeping in that
exact same position the other day.

50
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:41,915
Huh.

51
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:43,666
No, I'm serious.

52
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,056
So if a Shinigami has feelings
for a human and kills someone else

53
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:55,616
in order to extend that human's life
beyond its natural end, and Shinigami will die?

54
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:57,054
That's right.

55
00:03:58,962 --> 00:04:02,377
Good luck trying to find a
Shinigami who'd volunteer to do that?

56
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,677
That's true.

57
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:06,266
I can't see you ever doing that.

58
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,689
By the way, where did you send all those
tapes from, the ones that went to the TV stations?

59
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:12,787
Let's see.

60
00:04:12,812 --> 00:04:17,154
Osaka the first time, then
Tokyo, this other one from Nagano.

61
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,431
I took the bullet train every time, so that
way the police couldn't pinpoint my location.

62
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:23,223
All right. One more thing.

63
00:04:23,248 --> 00:04:26,779
Do you still have the videotapes and
envelopes with your friends fingerprints on them?

64
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:27,470
Uhhuh.

65
00:04:27,906 --> 00:04:32,118
Well, you'll have to dispose of everything that
was used to create those videotapes. Understand?

66
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,039
But before you do, I need you to send one last video,

67
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:38,248
and make sure it's from a place you haven't used yet.

68
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:43,266
It should say, "I've decided to stop searching for Kira.

69
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:47,173
And I'd like to thank the police
department for all of its advice.

70
00:04:47,264 --> 00:04:51,164
However, I still plan to help Kira in his mission,

71
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:54,956
and I hope that in time he will come to see me an ally.

72
00:04:55,173 --> 00:04:59,364
I will start by punishing
criminals that Kira has yet to judge.

73
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:04,525
Also, I will share my power
with others who I feel are worthy.

74
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,784
And I will encourage them to do the same.

75
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:09,109
Together, we'll make this world a better place."

76
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:10,620
Share my power?

77
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:13,810
We'll just add that part to throw off their investigation.

78
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:16,491
They suspect that there are
already two people with this power,

79
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:19,160
so it wouldn't be a stretch
to assume there could be others.

80
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:22,151
And if they believe the numbers are
growing, then they'll start to panic.

81
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:23,200
Can you do this?

82
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:24,316
No need to ask.

83
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:26,287
Just tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

84
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:29,231
I don't care what it is, 'cause I'd do anything for you.

85
00:05:29,257 --> 00:05:31,356
There's one more thing, which is very important.

86
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:32,048
What's that?

87
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:34,800
If you get arrested by the police,

88
00:05:34,825 --> 00:05:40,385
or if you're ever brought in for questioning, you
can never mention anything about us or the Death Note.

89
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:44,804
As long as they don't get a hold of that
notebook, there's no proof that you did anything.

90
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,306
Can you promise to say nothing?

91
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:48,595
I promise.

92
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:52,431
So this must mean that we're officially
boyfriend and girlfriend now, aren't we?

93
00:05:52,665 --> 00:05:54,308
Well sure. I guess.

94
00:05:54,423 --> 00:05:56,383
Then I'd like to add one condition.

95
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:59,227
You have to go on a date with me at least once week.

96
00:06:00,106 --> 00:06:02,697
Unbelievable. She still doesn't get it.

97
00:06:02,981 --> 00:06:03,891
We can't.

98
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:05,583
But why?

99
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:08,162
It looks like I'm going to have to spell this out for you.

100
00:06:08,187 --> 00:06:11,500
L already suspects that I'm Kira.
Do you see what I'm saying here?

101
00:06:11,915 --> 00:06:13,137
No way.

102
00:06:13,197 --> 00:06:14,716
L is amazing.

103
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:18,802
I mean, everyone's been saying that
he's getting nowhere with the investigation

104
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:20,875
and that he's a complete idiot and stuff.

105
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,570
But he already knows that much?

106
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,827
Anyway. It's all worked out well for me,

107
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:28,152
because thanks to that, I've
also been able to get close to L.

108
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:28,939
Huh?

109
00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:31,320
You and L are in contact with each other?

110
00:06:31,723 --> 00:06:33,764
Then that's even more amazing.

111
00:06:33,848 --> 00:06:35,722
This is getting so exciting!

112
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:37,935
Even though he suspects I'm Kira,

113
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,978
L figures he's safe as long as I don't know his real name.

114
00:06:41,016 --> 00:06:44,045
He came right out and told me
who we was, just to get to me.

115
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:49,226
However, he's only focusing on me
because he has no other suspects.

116
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:51,243
And he has no evidence.

117
00:06:52,694 --> 00:06:55,492
At this moment, I'm working with him on the case.

118
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,097
And little by little, I'm winning his trust.

119
00:06:58,473 --> 00:06:59,062
Great.

120
00:06:59,107 --> 00:07:02,797
So I'll you have to do is take me to where
L is and I can see his real name for you.

121
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:04,764
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

122
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,372
Hm?

123
00:07:05,414 --> 00:07:08,697
Listen, it was difficult enough
for me to get close to him.

124
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:13,805
Besides, if all of a sudden someone I
just met gets too close, and at the same time,

125
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,610
the police detect changes in
Kira or the second Kira's behavior,

126
00:07:17,635 --> 00:07:20,595
that person will be suspected of being in the second Kira.

127
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,132
And of course, that'll put me
under even greater suspicion.

128
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:26,053
We can't allow them to make that connection,

129
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:29,211
which means we can't appear to be too close to each other.

130
00:07:29,722 --> 00:07:31,817
Do you understand what I'm saying?

131
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:34,151
Well, I think I understand.

132
00:07:34,176 --> 00:07:36,547
So is that why we can't go on dates?

133
00:07:36,632 --> 00:07:39,645
We can't be seen in public,
because it'll look too suspicious?

134
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,413
Look, we need to take the time
now to come up with a good plan,

135
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:46,726
some way that you can see L
without letting him know you exist.

136
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:47,401
Yeah.

137
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:49,799
I can't eliminate L without you,

138
00:07:49,965 --> 00:07:53,732
so I'll call you and see you as
often as this situation allows?

139
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:55,056
You will.

140
00:07:55,198 --> 00:07:55,920
But...

141
00:07:55,948 --> 00:07:56,503
Oh?

142
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,770
to make sure that our meetings to stand out,

143
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:02,059
I have to make sure that I'm seen with other girls, OK?

144
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:03,659
Huh? What do you mean?

145
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,757
You're seriously gonna date other girls?

146
00:08:06,223 --> 00:08:07,522
Yeah, more or less.

147
00:08:07,547 --> 00:08:08,995
I don't want you too!

148
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,786
Huh?

149
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:14,205
If I see you with another girl, I'll kill her.

150
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:16,290
Scary.

151
00:08:16,531 --> 00:08:18,331
Look, sweetie.

152
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,445
Sweetie?

153
00:08:20,256 --> 00:08:21,888
This is not a game.

154
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:25,392
Both of us are risking our lives
to change the world, aren't we?

155
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:26,932
I know that.

156
00:08:27,114 --> 00:08:30,522
But, I love you more than the world, Light.

157
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:32,517
It sounds like you're confused.

158
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:36,533
Maybe it feels that way to you, but
you're here because you admire Kira.

159
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,344
You don't even know me. We just met.

160
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:41,905
Don't you believe in love at first sight?

161
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:42,755
No.

162
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,224
I admit that everything you said was true.

163
00:08:45,249 --> 00:08:49,342
I did want to meet Kira out of
gratitude and respect, not love.

164
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:51,997
But from the moment I first saw you, I knew.

165
00:08:52,022 --> 00:08:54,322
What is wrong with this girl?

166
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:56,909
Popular, as always.

167
00:08:57,114 --> 00:09:00,561
Well, you can show me your love by obeying me.

168
00:09:00,597 --> 00:09:03,031
I thought you said it was OK if I used you.

169
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,830
A minute ago, you swore you'd do anything I asked.

170
00:09:05,864 --> 00:09:09,151
Yeah, I did. But I never said you could date other girls.

171
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:11,711
I mean, those are two totally different things.

172
00:09:12,473 --> 00:09:15,501
I think you're forgetting I have both notebooks.

173
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,390
If you don't obey me, I can easily kill you.

174
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:21,811
I would never allow that, Light Yagami.

175
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:26,536
If you do anything that results in this girl's death,

176
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:29,922
the first thing I'll do is
wright your name in my Death Note.

177
00:09:29,947 --> 00:09:31,805
I will kill you.

178
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:36,617
I'm sure you realize that I can see her life span.

179
00:09:36,997 --> 00:09:39,501
If she happens to die before that time,

180
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:42,150
I'll know it was you who killed her.

181
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:44,837
But if you were to use your Death Note to save her,

182
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,940
wouldn't that mean you'd die, too?

183
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:47,973
That's right.

184
00:09:47,998 --> 00:09:50,405
If you tried to save me, you would die, too.

185
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,259
Yes, you are correct.

186
00:09:52,448 --> 00:09:55,466
But I'm quite willing to accept that outcome.

187
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,855
Is this Shinigami serious?

188
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:00,064
This is crazy.

189
00:10:00,214 --> 00:10:01,347
Then this means...

190
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:02,165
from now on...

191
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:02,993
Light?

192
00:10:03,347 --> 00:10:04,109
Huh?

193
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,209
Yeah, what is it?

194
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,372
It's almost 11:30, you know.

195
00:10:09,397 --> 00:10:11,928
You really shouldn't have a girl here this late.

196
00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:13,565
Oh, of course.

197
00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:15,522
I guess we lost track of time.

198
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,539
Sorry, Mrs. Yagami.

199
00:10:19,882 --> 00:10:22,751
I'm really sorry for coming over so late at night.

200
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,809
See you later, Light.

201
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:25,634
Yeah.

202
00:10:25,897 --> 00:10:28,587
Light, you should walk her to the station.

203
00:10:28,748 --> 00:10:29,587
Uh.

204
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:32,774
I can't risk being seen with her in public.

205
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:35,568
Oh, no, I'm all right. Thanks.

206
00:10:35,664 --> 00:10:36,876
Well, good night.

207
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:42,082
Isn't she cute?

208
00:10:42,398 --> 00:10:43,398
Yeah, I know.

209
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:45,974
When she got here, I wasn't so sure. But you're right.

210
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:47,082
She's cute, Mom.

211
00:10:47,122 --> 00:10:48,022
I like her.

212
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:51,405
That Shinigami is going to kill me if I kill that girl,

213
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:55,751
which means I'm going to have her
hanging around me until she dies.

214
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:58,603
Not only that, it also means that I'll be forced to

215
00:10:58,628 --> 00:11:01,823
protect her from being caught by
the police for the rest of her life.

216
00:11:04,282 --> 00:11:08,662
Thanks to you, Rem, Light really is
gonna be my knight in shining armor.

217
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:09,949
I suppose.

218
00:11:11,189 --> 00:11:11,957
Hm.

219
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,137
But you can't really kill him, OK?

220
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,119
For a Shinigami to die,

221
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:34,212
they have to use their Death
Note to save the life of a human,

222
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:36,744
a human who they have fallen in love with.

223
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:39,635
Ideally, I could kill Rem first.

224
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,196
Someone I was controlling would attack Misa,

225
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:45,717
forcing Rem to save her, but no, that would never work.

226
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:47,492
If Misa's life was put in danger,

227
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:50,877
Rem would immediately suspect me,
and I'd be the one who'd get killed.

228
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,529
As things stand, she's a bigger nuisance than L is.

229
00:11:55,554 --> 00:11:56,225
Huh?

230
00:11:56,677 --> 00:11:58,810
She she's famous?

231
00:11:58,894 --> 00:12:03,721
Oh, I don't even want to imagine what
would happen if someone found out about us.

232
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:05,753
Damn it.

233
00:12:05,918 --> 00:12:07,523
She's nothing but trouble.

234
00:12:07,804 --> 00:12:08,992
What should I do?

235
00:12:09,017 --> 00:12:15,133
No, more importantly, I need to think of
how I can use Misa's eyes to help me kill L.

236
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:18,221
If I can eliminate him...

237
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:21,802
Good morning, Light.

238
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,608
Good morning.

239
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:26,827
Mom, Sayu, could you do me a big favor

240
00:12:26,936 --> 00:12:29,273
and keep Misa a secret from Dad for now?

241
00:12:29,436 --> 00:12:30,546
All right.

242
00:12:30,571 --> 00:12:33,133
Actually, it's not just Dad.

243
00:12:33,158 --> 00:12:35,369
You can't tell anyone else about her either.

244
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:39,742
You see, Misa's an up-and-coming
model, so people can't know about us.

245
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:41,530
What! Is she really?

246
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:44,096
I thought she was pretty, but I had no idea.

247
00:12:44,151 --> 00:12:46,677
That's pretty impressive, even for you, Light.

248
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:49,479
I'll keep it a secret for $50!

249
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:50,887
Oh, stop it.

250
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:57,452
Ah, on page number 246

251
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,898
Misa's final message should arrive today.

252
00:12:59,923 --> 00:13:02,423
Although before it ever gets to the TV station,

253
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,056
it'll be rerouted to task force headquarters.

254
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:09,283
I have to go down there are some point
so I can see L's reaction first hand.

255
00:13:09,308 --> 00:13:09,912
Light.

256
00:13:10,144 --> 00:13:10,777
Light?

257
00:13:10,826 --> 00:13:11,404
Hm?

258
00:13:11,735 --> 00:13:13,433
I thought you and I were seeing each other.

259
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,431
That is, we're more than just friends, aren't we?

260
00:13:15,456 --> 00:13:17,156
Yeah, we are.

261
00:13:17,227 --> 00:13:17,967
Exactly.

262
00:13:17,992 --> 00:13:21,023
And that's the reason why I'm sitting
next to you in class, wouldn't you agree?

263
00:13:21,077 --> 00:13:21,887
Sure.

264
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,864
But you don't look like you enjoy being with me.

265
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:27,435
I mean, you haven't even looked at me once.

266
00:13:27,493 --> 00:13:29,092
That's not true at all.

267
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,129
I guess I was just thinking about how
everyone's going to be talking about us now.

268
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:37,250
To think that I'm actually going out
with Ms. Takada, the famous Ms. Todai.

269
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:40,331
I mean, you're the most beautiful woman at this school.

270
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:44,486
Why do you even care about stuff like that?

271
00:13:44,644 --> 00:13:47,462
Besides, I hate being called Ms. Todai or whatever.

272
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:48,544
It's embarrassing.

273
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:50,077
Yeah, you're right.

274
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:54,039
What do you know? She actually likes all the attention.

275
00:13:54,177 --> 00:13:57,677
We should forget about all that
stuff, and just go at our own pace.

276
00:13:58,177 --> 00:13:58,939
Yeah.

277
00:13:59,002 --> 00:14:02,277
...increased levels of dual
income housing through the 1990s.

278
00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:04,277
Hello.

279
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:06,031
Oh, come in.

280
00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:08,160
Your timing couldn't be better, actually.

281
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:11,789
We just received a new video message from the second Kira.

282
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,873
Huh? Wow, that didn't take long.

283
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:15,665
Yes.

284
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:17,773
I believe it's the last one.

285
00:14:18,152 --> 00:14:20,412
Well, take a look at this.

286
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,044
I've decided to stop searching for Kira.

287
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:27,164
And I'd like to thank the
police department for their advice.

288
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:30,275
However, I still plan to help Kira in his mission.

289
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:34,204
And I hope that, in time, you
will come to see me as an ally.

290
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:37,983
I will start by punishing
criminals that Kira has yet to judge.

291
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,914
Also, I will share my power
with others who I feel are worthy.

292
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:44,010
And I will encourage them to do the same.

293
00:14:44,227 --> 00:14:47,396
Together, we'll make this world a better place.

294
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:49,789
After watching this,

295
00:14:49,885 --> 00:14:54,121
I can only think that Kira and the
second Kira have managed to make contact.

296
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:56,421
What makes you say that?

297
00:14:56,752 --> 00:14:58,704
Oh, come on. Didn't you sense it?

298
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:02,694
I was sure you'd come to the same conclusion
I did after watching this once through.

299
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:09,129
First, consider how determined he was to meet Kira.

300
00:15:09,202 --> 00:15:10,758
So why the sudden change of heart?

301
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:13,595
Now he wants to punish criminals that Kira hasn't?

302
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,863
And all he wants out of it is
for Kira to see him as an ally?

303
00:15:18,535 --> 00:15:22,309
Mm, it begs the question, why
didn't he do this to begin with?

304
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:24,886
I'm guessing it's because he never thought that far ahead.

305
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:29,056
He probably met Kira and was told
which criminals he'd be allowed to judge.

306
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:34,414
Mm, I suspect the purpose of this
message is to hide the fact that they met.

307
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:35,489
I see.

308
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:39,546
What I find really strange is that
it's unlike Kira to be so careless.

309
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:40,498
That's true.

310
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:42,539
Mm.

311
00:15:42,564 --> 00:15:45,285
But are we to believe that Kira made a mistake this time?

312
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,068
Or is this his way of letting us
know that they have made contact?

313
00:15:48,093 --> 00:15:50,759
It would be an effective means of provoking us.

314
00:15:50,827 --> 00:15:53,192
The idea of their union is very threatening.

315
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:57,594
However, this is also one less
reason to suspect that Light is Kira.

316
00:15:58,235 --> 00:16:00,246
Ryuzaki, what do you mean by that?

317
00:16:00,777 --> 00:16:02,337
If Light is Kira,

318
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,821
I don't think this is the message he
would have had the second Kira send us.

319
00:16:05,846 --> 00:16:07,300
It doesn't fit.

320
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:11,567
He would have made the second Kira go
through with his plan to have me appear on TV,

321
00:16:11,808 --> 00:16:13,781
then deny that they ever made contact,

322
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,477
letting the second Kira shoulder the blame for my death.

323
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:20,937
He'd make him say something like, hm...

324
00:16:22,486 --> 00:16:24,358
although I agreed not to go through with this,

325
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:28,219
I have come to realize that it was
not Kira's true intention that I stop.

326
00:16:28,244 --> 00:16:31,404
I'm positive that the real Kira would want L to die.

327
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:33,860
There's no way he'd make me stop.

328
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:36,408
Ryuzaki?

329
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:37,142
Yes, Light?

330
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:38,685
I think you're mistaken.

331
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,177
I would never do that if I were Kira.

332
00:16:41,202 --> 00:16:41,969
Why not?

333
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:47,139
Well, if you're L and I'm Kira, then I'd
already know your personality pretty well.

334
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:51,477
L would never agree to appear on TV,
no matter what threat he was facing.

335
00:16:51,502 --> 00:16:54,200
And he wouldn't allow someone else to die in his place.

336
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,031
The L I know would find some way to escape the situation.

337
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,494
So, you've figured it out?

338
00:17:00,551 --> 00:17:01,518
Look, Light.

339
00:17:01,627 --> 00:17:02,827
You've got to stop that.

340
00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:06,483
I don't like hearing you say, "if
I were Kira," even hypothetically.

341
00:17:06,736 --> 00:17:08,569
Oh, I'm sorry Dad.

342
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,894
I just wanted to let Ryuzaki know
exactly what I thought of his plan.

343
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:13,658
Hm.

344
00:17:13,818 --> 00:17:17,012
I posed that scenario because
I want to help solve this case.

345
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,102
It's the only chance I have to clear my name.

346
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:24,392
Besides, the only reason I feel comfortable saying
things like that is because I'm not really Kira.

347
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,528
That's a good point.

348
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:28,711
You're not Kira.

349
00:17:28,935 --> 00:17:32,594
That is, it would be a problem if you were Kira,

350
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:38,437
because I feel you're the first
friend that I have ever had.

351
00:17:38,694 --> 00:17:40,754
Whoa.

352
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,579
Uh, yeah, I know what you mean.

353
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,787
The two of us have a lot in common.

354
00:17:52,692 --> 00:17:53,462
Thank you.

355
00:17:55,685 --> 00:17:58,581
And I have missed having you around at school.

356
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:00,797
We should play tennis again soon.

357
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:03,950
Yes, we should.

358
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:13,086
A friend?

359
00:18:13,402 --> 00:18:14,808
He's your friend?

360
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:17,502
That's a good thing, isn't it, Light?

361
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:20,416
That damn Ryuzaki had no problem figuring out

362
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:23,578
Kira and the second Kira had made contact with each other.

363
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:25,889
I've got to eliminate him right away.

364
00:18:26,135 --> 00:18:27,301
I see.

365
00:18:27,326 --> 00:18:28,897
The way things are progressing,

366
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:30,601
I can't afford to be seen with Misa.

367
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:32,267
Light!

368
00:18:33,892 --> 00:18:34,330
Ah!

369
00:18:34,355 --> 00:18:37,178
I'm sorry, but I just couldn't
wait for two weeks like you said.

370
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:40,851
Actually, I was just on my way
to your house when I spotted you.

371
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:44,514
This is the first time in my life

372
00:18:44,634 --> 00:18:46,986
that I've been provoked to hit a woman.

373
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:49,639
I I just wanted to see you so badly.

374
00:18:50,677 --> 00:18:53,405
Well, you might as well come over.

375
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,355
Yay!

376
00:18:58,235 --> 00:18:59,928
Another girlfriend?

377
00:19:01,635 --> 00:19:02,602
Oh!

378
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:04,059
Great to see you, Misa.

379
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:06,503
I saw you in a whole bunch of magazines.

380
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,974
Please, come on in.

381
00:19:08,893 --> 00:19:10,689
Sorry to drop by like this.

382
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:12,824
Could you make us some tea, Mom?

383
00:19:16,002 --> 00:19:16,635
Rem.

384
00:19:16,693 --> 00:19:17,326
Huh?

385
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:20,703
You are Misa's ally, aren't you?

386
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:21,753
Yes.

387
00:19:21,843 --> 00:19:24,884
I'd seen her many times from the Shinigami realm.

388
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:25,605
And then...

389
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:29,609
certain events made me develop feelings for her.

390
00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:31,697
Feelings? But you're a Shinigami.

391
00:19:32,802 --> 00:19:38,707
You don't like what I said before about how
I'd kill you if you even attempted to kill Misa.

392
00:19:38,751 --> 00:19:43,130
So, if Misa is happy, does that
mean that you'll be happy as well?

393
00:19:43,155 --> 00:19:45,049
I suppose you could say that.

394
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,899
I definitely don't want her to suffer.

395
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:53,424
As you know, Misa loves me.

396
00:19:53,544 --> 00:19:54,861
Oh, Light.

397
00:19:55,168 --> 00:19:55,951
Misa.

398
00:19:55,976 --> 00:19:56,818
Yes?

399
00:19:56,951 --> 00:20:00,318
If I was happy, would that make you happy, too?

400
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:01,218
Yes.

401
00:20:03,086 --> 00:20:06,416
Then could you ask Rem to kill L?

402
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,303
Huh?

403
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:10,091
Rem said that your happiness was important.

404
00:20:10,116 --> 00:20:13,026
But what do you think would happen if L caught one of us?

405
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:15,218
It means our happiness would be ruined.

406
00:20:16,276 --> 00:20:21,189
It's true that Shinigami are forbidden
to give out a person's name to anyone.

407
00:20:21,276 --> 00:20:25,003
But then again, there's no rule
that prevents Rem from killing anyone.

408
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:25,814
That's right.

409
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:30,291
And if you agree to kill L, it would
only make me love Misa that much more.

410
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:31,899
Plus, I'd be grateful to you.

411
00:20:31,924 --> 00:20:35,164
Most importantly, the two of us will be happy together.

412
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,657
Rem, I want Light to love me.

413
00:20:38,768 --> 00:20:41,228
And I know we could be happy together.

414
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,252
It's all I ever wanted.

415
00:20:52,576 --> 00:20:53,820
That's a shame.

416
00:20:55,568 --> 00:20:56,470
Fine.

417
00:20:57,927 --> 00:21:00,229
As you wish, Light Yagami.

418
00:21:00,352 --> 00:21:02,270
But I do not like you.

419
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:06,635
This will not kill me, even if
it ends up lengthening your life.

420
00:21:07,152 --> 00:21:09,143
I will kill L for you.

421
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:12,875
It really makes no difference.
He is just another human to me.

422
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:14,116
Hooray!

423
00:21:14,718 --> 00:21:18,410
Oh, Rem, thank you so much. I knew I could count on you.

424
00:21:19,918 --> 00:21:21,583
L will die.

425
00:21:22,394 --> 00:21:24,665
That's all it took.

426
00:22:39,293 --> 00:22:40,301
That's right.

427
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:44,059
Ryuga revealed that he's L. Therefore, he must die.

428
00:22:44,084 --> 00:22:45,450
The game is over.

429
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:52,274
Tomorrow will be L's, or at least
Ryuga and Ryuzaki's, last day alive.
