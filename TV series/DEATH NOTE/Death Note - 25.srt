1
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:46,221
Ryuzaki.

2
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:48,453
Is something the matter? What is it?

3
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:52,273
Hm?

4
00:02:56,187 --> 00:02:57,209
What's wrong?

5
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:08,804
Hm. Interesting.

6
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:11,942
The corner of the page of this notebook has been torn off.

7
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:15,113
Can you kill someone just by
writing their name on a piece?

8
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:16,513
Can't say.

9
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,369
I've never tried using it like that,
and I don't know of anyone who has.

10
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,148
Then let me ask you. Do gods of death love apples?

11
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:25,681
Not necessarily.

12
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,947
You see, our internal organs have already degraded.

13
00:03:29,088 --> 00:03:33,306
We've evolved to a point where
we do not require sustenance.

14
00:03:34,177 --> 00:03:35,036
Say, Light.

15
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:41,665
You're finally free to leave headquarters on
your own, but it seems like you never go out.

16
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:46,702
Even when Misa comes to visit, you only
chat with her for a few minutes outside.

17
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:50,609
You do realize you're free to
have a relationship with her now?

18
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:53,717
That can wait until we've managed to solve this case.

19
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:57,032
I'm not in the mood for love or anything else right now.

20
00:03:57,365 --> 00:04:01,512
Anyway, are you suggesting that
I'll be a nuisance for staying here?

21
00:04:02,554 --> 00:04:03,109
No.

22
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,046
Right now, I'm in no position
to continue punishing criminals.

23
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:34,303
That's why I need you to punish them for me.

24
00:04:38,523 --> 00:04:39,641
Misa.

25
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:42,304
Let's create a new world together.

26
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:07,657
Careful what you do,

27
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,854
'cause God is watching your every move.

28
00:05:13,265 --> 00:05:16,050
Hold my hand in the dark street.

29
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:21,746
For if you do, I know that I'll be safe.

30
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:25,932
Even if I'm far away and alone,

31
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:30,182
I can be sure that you'll find me there.

32
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:32,586
This I know.

33
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:36,789
You draw me close for a while. So quiet.

34
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:40,017
You tell me everything.

35
00:05:41,148 --> 00:05:45,864
If I forget what you say, then you'd come to me

36
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:48,819
and tell me again.

37
00:05:50,087 --> 00:05:55,471
Yes, you'd tell me once again.

38
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,668
But what happens when I know it all?

39
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:08,394
Then what should I do after that?

40
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:11,481
What then?

41
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,677
What's going on?

42
00:06:21,477 --> 00:06:23,772
I heard criminals are being killed again.

43
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,679
There were 16 deaths just yesterday.

44
00:06:25,837 --> 00:06:28,637
All of them were broadcast after Higuchi's death.

45
00:06:28,735 --> 00:06:30,435
Immediately after, huh?

46
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,386
Do you think this could mean that
Higuchi wasn't necessarily Kira after all?

47
00:06:34,411 --> 00:06:35,091
No.

48
00:06:35,276 --> 00:06:39,274
It's safe to say that Higuchi was the one
killing criminals until we apprehended him.

49
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,407
Then this means we're dealing with yet another Kira.

50
00:06:42,617 --> 00:06:45,613
Aw, man! Not again!

51
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:48,307
Damn. Damn you, Kira.

52
00:06:48,332 --> 00:06:51,380
Another Kira's appeared? What's going on here?

53
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:54,746
I can't believe this.

54
00:06:54,987 --> 00:06:56,567
It has to be Misa.

55
00:06:57,632 --> 00:07:00,526
These killings began as soon
as Misa was free, didn't they?

56
00:07:00,551 --> 00:07:03,132
Ryuzaki, are you still going on about that?

57
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:04,789
She has nothing to do with this.

58
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:06,217
Think about it.

59
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:08,282
This started as soon as Higuchi died.

60
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:10,279
I suppose you're right.

61
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:12,658
Oh, well.

62
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:18,552
If there is another notebook floating around out
there and someone is now using it to kill criminals,

63
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,960
I'll just have to bring that person to justice.

64
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,724
The Shinigami insisted that it didn't know,

65
00:07:30,798 --> 00:07:35,755
but if someone were able to kill simply by
writing a name on a torn piece of the notebook.

66
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:40,615
It's not impossible, but there's that rule.

67
00:07:40,724 --> 00:07:44,844
Whoever writes a name in this notebook
has to write another name within 13 days.

68
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:46,270
Otherwise, they die.

69
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:50,387
Light Yagami and Misa Amane are both still alive.

70
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:53,906
13 days.

71
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:55,749
That's the only problem.

72
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,374
Ryuzaki, I've been thinking,

73
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:03,983
even if we do manage to catch the person
who's been writing names in the notebook,

74
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:07,808
will we really be able to legally
convict and punish them for mass homicide?

75
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:08,817
What?

76
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:10,611
Of course we can convict them.

77
00:08:10,636 --> 00:08:14,757
This guy's intentionally writing names in the
notebook, knowing that these people are going to die.

78
00:08:14,782 --> 00:08:19,267
Even if we don't plan on publicly acknowledging the
notebook, the least we can do is execute the killer.

79
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:22,315
It's not a very humane way to do things,

80
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,465
but the higher-ups would probably
want to take measures like that.

81
00:08:25,665 --> 00:08:30,528
If they admit to killing with the notebook, they'd
receive the death penalty, or life in prison, at least.

82
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:34,187
That's the best that they could hope for.

83
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:36,698
What are you thinking, Light Yagami,

84
00:08:36,776 --> 00:08:38,277
making Misa kill again?

85
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:41,267
She'll be caught, and once that happens, you'll also be...

86
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:44,815
So that's what your plan is.

87
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:47,417
You're truly disgusting.

88
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:54,265
Light Yagami is certain that I will do
anything to help Misa and save her life.

89
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,804
And at this point, the only way for me to save
Misa is to write Ryuzaki's real name in my notebook.

90
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:04,642
And if I kill Ryuzaki,

91
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:10,449
it would mean that I deliberately lengthened Misa's life,

92
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:12,396
and I will die as well.

93
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:17,288
Light Yagami has planned everything
so that it will work out in his favor.

94
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,405
What are you gonna do, Rem?

95
00:09:21,431 --> 00:09:26,019
You may be a Shinigami, but you can't
hide the fact that you care for Misa.

96
00:09:26,298 --> 00:09:31,404
There's no way you would turn your back on her
now, after she's already halved her lifespan twice.

97
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:32,468
Come on.

98
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,543
Think about Misa's happiness.

99
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,434
What are you doing, standing out there by yourself?

100
00:10:43,452 --> 00:10:46,370
What are you doing standing out there by yourself?

101
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,298
What are you doing, Ryuzaki?

102
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:05,612
Oh, I'm not doing anything in particular. It's just...

103
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:08,005
I hear the bell.

104
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:09,726
The bell?

105
00:11:10,698 --> 00:11:11,496
Yes.

106
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:15,492
The sound of the bell is being unusually loud today.

107
00:11:17,782 --> 00:11:18,526
Hm?

108
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:20,543
I don't hear anything.

109
00:11:21,797 --> 00:11:23,721
Really? You can't hear it?

110
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,954
It's been ringing nonstop all day.

111
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:28,121
I find it very distracting.

112
00:11:28,752 --> 00:11:32,524
I wonder if it's a church?
Maybe a wedding, or perhaps a...

113
00:11:33,698 --> 00:11:35,698
What are you getting at, Ryuzaki?

114
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:38,162
Come on, cut it out. Let's get back inside.

115
00:11:39,987 --> 00:11:40,830
I'm sorry.

116
00:11:41,886 --> 00:11:44,961
Nothing I say makes any sense, anyway.

117
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:47,733
If I were you, I wouldn't believe any of it.

118
00:11:56,426 --> 00:11:57,916
You know, you're totally right.

119
00:11:58,397 --> 00:12:01,588
Honestly, most of the things you
say sound like complete nonsense.

120
00:12:01,703 --> 00:12:05,761
There'd be no end to my troubles if I
actually took you seriously all the time.

121
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,820
I probably know that better than anyone.

122
00:12:08,997 --> 00:12:09,695
Yes.

123
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:12,250
I would say that's a fair assessment.

124
00:12:13,475 --> 00:12:16,377
But... I could say the same about you.

125
00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:18,121
Hm?

126
00:12:18,675 --> 00:12:20,283
What's that supposed to mean?

127
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,585
Tell me, Light, from the moment you were born,

128
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,997
has there ever been a point where
you've actually told the truth?

129
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:35,592
Where's this coming from, Ryuzaki?

130
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:38,750
I do admit, I stretch the truth here and there.

131
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,365
However, find me one person in this
world who's never had to tell a lie.

132
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,793
It wouldn't be easy.

133
00:12:45,653 --> 00:12:48,919
Human beings just aren't made to be perfect like that.

134
00:12:48,944 --> 00:12:51,000
Everybody lies from time to time.

135
00:12:51,664 --> 00:12:56,774
Even so, I've always made a conscious effort to
be careful not to tell a lie that could hurt others.

136
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,630
That's my answer.

137
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:04,410
I had a feeling you'd say something like that.

138
00:13:08,776 --> 00:13:10,182
Let's go back inside.

139
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:11,583
We're both drenched.

140
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:13,272
Yeah.

141
00:13:24,797 --> 00:13:27,350
Well, that was certainly an unpleasant outing.

142
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:29,533
It's your own fault.

143
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,113
I mean, what did you expect?

144
00:13:31,907 --> 00:13:32,733
You're right.

145
00:13:33,276 --> 00:13:34,081
Sorry.

146
00:13:42,808 --> 00:13:44,038
What are you doing?

147
00:13:44,263 --> 00:13:46,108
I thought I might help you out.

148
00:13:46,253 --> 00:13:48,530
You were busy wiping yourself off, anyway.

149
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:51,054
Look, it's fine. You don't have to do that.

150
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:52,925
I can give you a massage, as well.

151
00:13:53,138 --> 00:13:55,795
It's the least I can do to atone for my sins.

152
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:57,654
I'm actually pretty good at this.

153
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,802
Fine. Do what you want.

154
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:02,137
All right.

155
00:14:09,027 --> 00:14:09,994
Hey.

156
00:14:10,786 --> 00:14:11,887
You'll get used to it.

157
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,891
Here. You're still soaked.

158
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,817
I'm sorry.

159
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:52,807
It'll be lonely, won't it?

160
00:14:52,832 --> 00:14:53,409
Hm?

161
00:14:56,219 --> 00:14:58,543
You and I will be parting ways soon.

162
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:07,371
Yes?

163
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:10,941
I understand.

164
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,997
I'm on my way.

165
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:13,289
Huh?

166
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:18,157
Come on. Let's go, Light.

167
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:20,783
It seems like it's all worked out.

168
00:15:24,245 --> 00:15:24,998
Hm?

169
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,935
Ryuzaki. What's the meaning of all this?

170
00:15:34,626 --> 00:15:38,420
You've somehow gotten approval from another
country to use the notebook for an execution?

171
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:39,615
Watari.

172
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:41,356
Excellent work. Thank you.

173
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:42,283
Not at all.

174
00:15:42,764 --> 00:15:43,930
First things first.

175
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,728
Please make arrangements to
transport the notebook immediately.

176
00:15:46,753 --> 00:15:47,528
Right.

177
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:49,792
Ryuzaki, what are you trying to do?

178
00:15:51,098 --> 00:15:53,635
I'm going to try out the notebook for real.

179
00:15:56,086 --> 00:15:57,227
We can't do that!

180
00:15:57,258 --> 00:16:00,951
And there's no point in testing it now when
we already know the notebook's power is real.

181
00:16:00,976 --> 00:16:02,622
And besides, who's gonna write the name?

182
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,916
If someone starts writing in the notebook,
they'll have to obey the 13 day rule,

183
00:16:06,941 --> 00:16:08,657
and keep writing names forever.

184
00:16:08,682 --> 00:16:10,338
It's already been worked out.

185
00:16:10,764 --> 00:16:16,253
The person who will write in the book is a
criminal scheduled to be executed is just over 13 days.

186
00:16:16,286 --> 00:16:20,567
If he's still alive 13 days after writing
the name, he'll be pardoned from execution.

187
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,559
But still, to sacrifice a life...

188
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:24,804
We're very close.

189
00:16:25,588 --> 00:16:29,196
If we work this out, the entire case will be solved.

190
00:16:34,752 --> 00:16:35,623
What is this?

191
00:16:35,648 --> 00:16:36,878
A... A blackout?

192
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:48,696
Watari?

193
00:16:50,831 --> 00:16:51,807
Watari!

194
00:16:55,603 --> 00:16:56,681
Data deletion?

195
00:16:56,706 --> 00:16:57,995
What the hell's going on?

196
00:16:58,575 --> 00:17:02,528
I told Watari to make sure that
he should erase all information

197
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,905
in the event that something were to happen to him.

198
00:17:05,752 --> 00:17:07,719
If something were to happen?

199
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:09,171
Could it be...

200
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:10,486
Where is the Shinigami?

201
00:17:10,511 --> 00:17:12,441
Good question. I don't see it.

202
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:16,337
It disappeared?

203
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,293
What's going on?

204
00:17:17,557 --> 00:17:19,559
Everyone, the Shiniga...

205
00:17:49,814 --> 00:17:52,805
Ryuzaki! What's wrong?

206
00:18:57,675 --> 00:19:00,085
Hey, Ryuzaki.

207
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:00,852
Come on.

208
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:02,026
Snap out of it!

209
00:19:02,051 --> 00:19:02,786
What happened?

210
00:19:02,811 --> 00:19:04,299
What's going on?

211
00:19:06,922 --> 00:19:08,491
Calm down, Light.

212
00:19:08,665 --> 00:19:09,898
We're gonna die!

213
00:19:09,923 --> 00:19:12,858
Watari, Ryuzaki. It'll be us next!

214
00:19:26,072 --> 00:19:27,248
Damn you!

215
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:30,385
Where are you, Shinigami? Come out!

216
00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:32,224
Wait, Light.

217
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:34,611
You know something about this, don't you?

218
00:19:34,636 --> 00:19:35,652
Come on out!

219
00:19:36,753 --> 00:19:38,131
We'd better go and look, too.

220
00:19:39,231 --> 00:19:39,698
Right.

221
00:19:39,723 --> 00:19:41,286
Mogi. Take over for me.

222
00:19:41,468 --> 00:19:42,125
OK.

223
00:20:03,242 --> 00:20:04,525
There's something here!

224
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,462
What the hell is this stuff?

225
00:20:07,487 --> 00:20:08,278
Sand?

226
00:20:08,383 --> 00:20:09,684
What does this mean?

227
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:14,858
Whatever it might mean, whatever happens next,

228
00:20:15,364 --> 00:20:17,702
I swear I'll avenge Ryuzaki's death.

229
00:20:18,993 --> 00:20:22,662
We're going to solve this case in honor of him,

230
00:20:22,894 --> 00:20:27,268
and for Watari, and all the other victims.

231
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:28,853
Oh, Light.

232
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:30,645
Let's do this. For them.

233
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:34,888
Yeah, but aren't we all gonna get killed?

234
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:37,403
Isn't that what all this really means?

235
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:38,475
Matsuda.

236
00:20:38,732 --> 00:20:41,510
If you're afraid of dying, then leave the investigation.

237
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,607
We put our lives on the line when we chose to be here.

238
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,775
Yeah. That's true.

239
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:50,072
But it... it's weird hearing you say that.

240
00:20:50,675 --> 00:20:52,174
You sound like Ryuzaki.

241
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:09,440
I've gotten rid of everything in my way.

242
00:21:16,504 --> 00:21:19,497
I am the GOD of the New World.

243
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:41,060
Ryuzaki, Watari, Rem.

244
00:22:41,492 --> 00:22:44,340
I've gotten rid of everything in my way.

245
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:48,166
I am the GOD of the New World.
