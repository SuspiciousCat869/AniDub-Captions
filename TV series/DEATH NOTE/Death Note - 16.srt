1
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,679
I hereby relinquish ownership of this Death Note.

2
00:01:44,182 --> 00:01:47,219
Take care of her. You gave your word.

3
00:01:55,644 --> 00:01:56,365
Huh?

4
00:02:05,676 --> 00:02:07,140
Mr. Stalker?

5
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,938
Hello, Mister? Where are you right now?

6
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:14,003
Do... Do do you think we could stop this game?

7
00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:15,694
Huh? Stalker?

8
00:02:15,732 --> 00:02:16,870
Where'd she get that?

9
00:02:17,382 --> 00:02:19,612
What's with the new attitude all of a sudden?

10
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,900
Just as I thought.

11
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:30,071
As long as I still have Ryuk's notebook,

12
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:34,508
even though I gave up Rem's, all
awareness I have of Rem still remains.

13
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:38,337
Rem, the only reason I have to go through all this trouble

14
00:02:38,362 --> 00:02:41,460
is because you brought another
Death Note to the human world.

15
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:45,733
Is this really what you want, Light?

16
00:02:45,758 --> 00:02:46,541
Yeah.

17
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:49,442
OK.

18
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,727
I never thought the Death Note I gave
you would end up buried and abandoned.

19
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:55,502
Listen, Ryuk.

20
00:02:55,983 --> 00:02:57,902
For the time being, I'm just hiding it.

21
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,195
But it stays mine,

22
00:03:00,512 --> 00:03:05,410
until the next time you hear me say
the following words "Get rid of it".

23
00:03:05,483 --> 00:03:08,050
When I say that, regardless of the context,

24
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:11,210
assume that I want to relinquish
ownership of this Death Note.

25
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:12,300
Got it.

26
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,339
Mr. Stalker?

27
00:03:14,364 --> 00:03:16,629
This is illegal. You have to stop.

28
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,412
OK? Come on, please?

29
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:22,831
She's been acting like this ever
since she regained consciousness.

30
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:23,964
Seriously.

31
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:26,459
Does she think she can get out
of this just by playing dumb?

32
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,677
OK. How about this?

33
00:03:28,784 --> 00:03:31,541
You could at least take off my blindfold. Don't you think?

34
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:33,723
It'll be nice to see what you look like.

35
00:03:35,592 --> 00:03:37,692
Matsuda, call Mogi for me.

36
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:38,448
Huh?

37
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,194
Just a second.

38
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:42,674
Here.

39
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:48,175
Mr. Mogi, when you apprehended Misa Amane, you
made it clear that she was a suspect, am I correct?

40
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:50,585
Yes, like you told me.

41
00:03:50,758 --> 00:03:53,039
First, I blindfolded her and covered her mouth.

42
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:55,885
I... told her that we knew she was the second Kira.

43
00:03:56,076 --> 00:03:57,808
I made sure that she heard me.

44
00:03:58,017 --> 00:04:01,001
She didn't struggle when I put
the blindfold and handcuffs on her.

45
00:04:01,026 --> 00:04:03,317
It was like... she'd accepted it.

46
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,429
What if I gave you an autograph, or shook your hang?

47
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:09,276
I know. I can give you a kiss on the cheek of you want.

48
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:11,868
Oh, come on. I won't run away. I promise.

49
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:16,631
We'd already made so much progress
with her, I actually thought she'd crack.

50
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,131
Why is she suddenly talking about a stalker?

51
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,023
Misa Amane.

52
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:24,667
Huh? What's that, Mr. Stalker?

53
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:26,808
Are you planning to release me?

54
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:29,446
Before you passed out, you barely spoke.

55
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:31,116
And you even asked me to kill you.

56
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,050
And now you're claiming ignorance?

57
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:35,329
Hm? I don't understand.

58
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,825
I mean, you're the one who knocked me
out and then brought me here, remember?

59
00:04:39,175 --> 00:04:39,842
Wait.

60
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:40,789
I get it.

61
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:44,287
This is some kind of Misa Amane
interrogation fantasy, right?

62
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,452
Huh?

63
00:04:45,984 --> 00:04:47,736
Do you know why I'm detaining you here?

64
00:04:47,761 --> 00:04:48,972
You must have some idea.

65
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:49,966
What do you mean?

66
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:52,048
Because I'm a celebrity, obviously.

67
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,316
But you're definitely the first
stalker who's ever gone this far.

68
00:04:55,341 --> 00:04:56,907
And you're starting to scare me.

69
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,173
Hey, Amane! No one's buying this, so cut it out.

70
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:04,577
Oh, this is scary. What's going on?

71
00:05:04,602 --> 00:05:07,277
I can't stand it anymore! Please let me go!

72
00:05:07,302 --> 00:05:08,898
You have to let me go!

73
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,106
I... I need to go to the bathroom.

74
00:05:11,131 --> 00:05:13,247
I have to go to the bathroom again, OK?

75
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:16,283
It's only been four minutes
since you last went to the bathroom.

76
00:05:16,308 --> 00:05:18,223
I'm afraid you'll have to hold it.

77
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:19,764
You have to.

78
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:22,479
It's the only time you'll untie me and let me move.

79
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,125
Plus, you'd be able to watch.

80
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,421
Isn't that what you want?

81
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,314
Isn't it?

82
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,802
You pervert!

83
00:05:28,216 --> 00:05:30,806
I'm a pervert?

84
00:05:31,683 --> 00:05:36,652
Amane, let's get back to the conversation
we were having before you lost consciousness.

85
00:05:36,974 --> 00:05:39,256
First of all, do you know who Light Yagami is.

86
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:40,977
And if so, why did you approach him?

87
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,214
Huh?

88
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:43,539
What do you mean?

89
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:45,504
How can I not know my own boyfriend?

90
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,652
She was so tight-lipped about it earlier.

91
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:50,073
Now she's openly admitting he's her boyfriend?

92
00:05:50,408 --> 00:05:52,012
Where is this coming from?

93
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:55,962
Good timing. It's Light.

94
00:05:57,258 --> 00:05:59,056
Please turn the video and audio off.

95
00:05:59,081 --> 00:05:59,620
Yes.

96
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,393
Yes?

97
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:04,009
Yes, I understand.

98
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:06,385
We'll be expecting you in room K2801.

99
00:06:07,858 --> 00:06:10,358
Are you saying my son's coming here?

100
00:06:23,956 --> 00:06:27,100
Ryuzaki, like I said over the phone,

101
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:29,814
I could be Kira.

102
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,773
No, Light.

103
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:34,467
What are you talking about?

104
00:06:34,516 --> 00:06:36,958
Why would you even say something like that?

105
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:37,844
Why?

106
00:06:38,109 --> 00:06:40,690
There's no real proof that Light Yagami is Kira,

107
00:06:40,715 --> 00:06:44,325
so why come here to announce that you could be Kira?

108
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,779
It's an act.

109
00:06:45,842 --> 00:06:48,687
There's no "could be" about it. You are Kira.

110
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:51,367
What do you hope to accomplish by this?

111
00:06:51,884 --> 00:06:52,902
Look, Dad.

112
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:57,075
If Ryuzaki is L, then it's safe to say
that he is the world's best detective.

113
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,967
And right now, he seems pretty sure that I'm Kira.

114
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,629
We know L's never been wrong before.

115
00:07:02,654 --> 00:07:04,821
What... What are you saying, Light?

116
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:05,733
Stop this.

117
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:08,908
What about that FBI agent, Ray Penber?

118
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:12,377
It was me he was investigating immediately before he died.

119
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:15,018
And I was in Oyama on May 22.

120
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:20,706
Also, I'm the first person in the Kanto region
that Misa, the alleged second Kira, approached.

121
00:07:20,758 --> 00:07:22,466
It's all been me.

122
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:27,742
If I were in L's place, even I
would have come to the same conclusion.

123
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:31,702
You see, subconsciously, I might be Kira.

124
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:34,866
If that were the case, I could
be him and not even know it.

125
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:35,923
No, Light.

126
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:37,843
I see.

127
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:40,116
So you're not conscious of it, huh?

128
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:43,912
I... I'm not sure of anything anymore.

129
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:46,026
I'd never kill someone, but...

130
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,794
unconsciously, who knows what I'm capable of?

131
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:51,250
Another me could be killing people as I sleep.

132
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:52,964
I'm afraid that's not possible.

133
00:07:53,276 --> 00:07:55,691
Huh? Not possible? What do you mean?

134
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:58,121
Well, I never mentioned this to you, but at one point,

135
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:01,713
I had hidden surveillance cameras
installed in your room for five days.

136
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,158
Cameras?

137
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:04,152
Yes.

138
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,668
Every single night, you slept normally.

139
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:11,027
Criminals whose names were broadcast were still dying,

140
00:08:11,052 --> 00:08:13,375
even though you would have had
no way of knowing about them.

141
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,629
But this didn't prove your innocence to me.

142
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:17,943
All it proved was that if you were Kira,

143
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:20,783
no amount of camera surveillance would reveal that fact.

144
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:24,006
Wouldn't reveal that fact, huh?

145
00:08:25,216 --> 00:08:27,535
I don't know. It could be true.

146
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:33,431
I have to admit, I found myself thinking
that some criminals deserve to die.

147
00:08:33,684 --> 00:08:36,272
If I can think like Kira, then how can I be sure

148
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,405
that I'm not actually him?

149
00:08:38,608 --> 00:08:39,708
Hold on, Light.

150
00:08:39,842 --> 00:08:41,731
I feel exactly the same way.

151
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,756
I found myself thinking before that
some people would be better off dead.

152
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:48,618
But still, that doesn't mean we're
going to go out and kill people.

153
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:50,033
Isn't that right?

154
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,877
Besides, criminals were still being killed,
even while you had no knowledge of them.

155
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,687
I mean, the surveillance cameras proved it, didn't they?

156
00:08:57,234 --> 00:08:58,510
Well, no.

157
00:08:58,535 --> 00:09:02,571
Because we were short of investigators
then, we only watched him while he was at home.

158
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:06,504
Truth is, we weren't able to
watch him every hour of the day.

159
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:10,810
It's possible he could have found some way
to kill those criminals well he wasn't at home.

160
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,321
This was premeditated.

161
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:17,921
It's no accident he chose to do this now.

162
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:21,310
Well, what if we incarcerate you for a while,

163
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:23,406
imprison you like we did Amane?

164
00:09:23,558 --> 00:09:26,648
If criminals whose names are made public keep dying,

165
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,731
then it would lead us to think
that you're innocent, right?

166
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:34,133
Is that how you imagined it?

167
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:42,108
Honestly, I don't like the way that this is going at all,

168
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:43,681
but what choice do I have?

169
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:45,590
Let's do it.

170
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:49,496
I need you to fully restrain Light Yagami

171
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:51,629
and place him in solitary confinement.

172
00:09:51,654 --> 00:09:52,777
What? You can't!

173
00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:55,700
You want us to confine him? Seriously?

174
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,690
If we're going to do this,
then it has to happen immediately.

175
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,425
From this point on, you can't be allowed
to go anywhere where I can't see you.

176
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:03,658
This is crazy.

177
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:06,175
There's no way my son could be Kira.

178
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:07,791
My son's not capable of...

179
00:10:07,822 --> 00:10:09,102
It's OK, Dad.

180
00:10:09,758 --> 00:10:11,019
Stop this, Light.

181
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:14,765
Listen, something has to be done about this.

182
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:16,758
As long as I'm having these doubts,

183
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:19,083
I can't work with you to catch Kira.

184
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:21,871
But Ryuzaki, promise me this.

185
00:10:21,992 --> 00:10:25,492
Until you can say with absolute
certainty that I'm not Kira,

186
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:30,319
you cannot set me free, no matter what I
might say or what condition I might be in.

187
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:32,342
You have my word.

188
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:36,760
Mr. Yagami, can you come up with
some sort of excuse for Light's absence,

189
00:10:36,805 --> 00:10:38,360
something to tell your family?

190
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,429
And please do it now.

191
00:10:40,454 --> 00:10:42,883
But this is all so sudden. What should I say?

192
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,421
And then I see no reason why he should be in prison.

193
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:46,735
Let it go, Dad.

194
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:47,363
Huh?

195
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:50,275
If I don't do this, I won't be able to live with myself.

196
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:53,281
But son, do you really mean that?

197
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,823
Yeah.

198
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:57,625
I believe that by giving up my very freedom,

199
00:10:58,288 --> 00:11:00,903
I'll defeat this fear that Kira lurks within me.

200
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,225
Aizawa, please take him away.

201
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,698
Right.

202
00:11:10,908 --> 00:11:11,740
Hm.

203
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,929
Next, I just have to get rid of the notebook.

204
00:11:35,954 --> 00:11:39,030
So, I guess apples are out of the question?

205
00:11:49,682 --> 00:11:54,309
Ryuzaki, I'd like to request that
you take me off this investigation.

206
00:11:54,403 --> 00:11:54,830
Chief, no!

207
00:11:54,854 --> 00:11:55,315
But why?

208
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:59,928
I thought about it, and the fact is that
we're holding my son, Light, as a prime suspect.

209
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:02,969
Given that, it's not appropriate for me to be here.

210
00:12:03,444 --> 00:12:06,915
When we spoke earlier, my feelings got in the way.

211
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:10,438
It's impossible for me to be objective in this situation.

212
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:12,185
I agree with you.

213
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:14,609
We can't let personal feelings get in the way.

214
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:16,624
And in truth,

215
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:20,353
if... if the task force concludes that my son is Kira,

216
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:22,805
I don't know what I'd be capable of.

217
00:12:23,128 --> 00:12:24,851
Yes, I'll agree with you there.

218
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,077
To be honest, I wondered what you might do.

219
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:30,136
I believe you'd kill your son and then yourself.

220
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:34,410
I'd also agree that it's best that
we don't have you working here for now.

221
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:39,876
Ryuzaki, I will ask that you confine me as well.

222
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,089
At the moment, I'm calm.

223
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:45,217
But to be honest, I'm not sure
how much more of this I can take.

224
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:47,803
I thought you might say that. So I spoke with Watari.

225
00:12:47,995 --> 00:12:49,340
He's made arrangements.

226
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,767
Mm, but, your confinement will be different.

227
00:12:56,186 --> 00:12:58,220
You will keep your cell phone turned on

228
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:01,405
and maintain regular contact with family and friends.

229
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:03,717
You won't tell Light about this.

230
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:08,533
If he does call you at some point, he must be
made to believe that you're still at headquarters.

231
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:11,559
While you're in confinement,

232
00:13:11,803 --> 00:13:14,511
we'll be giving you continuous
updates on the investigation.

233
00:13:14,536 --> 00:13:15,963
So you'll know what's happening.

234
00:13:17,994 --> 00:13:19,646
So how does that sound to you?

235
00:13:20,121 --> 00:13:21,462
I'm grateful.

236
00:13:21,728 --> 00:13:22,603
Thank you.

237
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:33,957
Hey, Mister, I really want to take a bath.

238
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:36,957
I'm pretty sure you already know where I live, don't you?

239
00:13:36,986 --> 00:13:39,176
Could you bring me some clean clothes.

240
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:42,556
I didn't think this could get any more bizarre.

241
00:13:42,777 --> 00:13:45,415
I feel so sorry for the chief right now.

242
00:13:48,102 --> 00:13:49,969
Ryuzaki talk to me.

243
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:50,909
What's happening?

244
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,488
Have any new criminals been identified,
anyone that Kira would be likely to target?

245
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:57,573
If so, has he killed any of them?

246
00:13:59,577 --> 00:14:03,138
In fact, quite a few criminals'
names have been broadcast recently.

247
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:05,210
But since you've been detained,

248
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:08,161
we haven't had one report of a
criminal being killed by Kira.

249
00:14:08,336 --> 00:14:10,261
Wait, no one's been killed?

250
00:14:10,678 --> 00:14:11,607
Really?

251
00:14:11,878 --> 00:14:12,678
Yes.

252
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,086
I see.

253
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:17,867
So it's only a matter of time
before I'm convicted as Kira.

254
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:20,107
What I wouldn't give for an apple.

255
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:22,609
What's going on here?

256
00:14:23,086 --> 00:14:26,638
I thought the murders would
continue even after Light was confined.

257
00:14:26,736 --> 00:14:30,019
Instead, they've stopped completely.

258
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:34,034
Light asked to be confined in the first place.

259
00:14:34,593 --> 00:14:38,978
If this continues, it'll only
strengthen the argument that he is Kira.

260
00:14:39,886 --> 00:14:44,788
The question left will be whether
or not he was conscious of being Kira.

261
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:47,201
Does he really think that's gonna work,

262
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:52,386
that he'll be let off the hook if he can
just prove he wasn't conscious of being Kira?

263
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:55,186
It's not like Light Yagami.

264
00:14:55,236 --> 00:14:56,936
No, it's not like Kira.

265
00:15:02,286 --> 00:15:04,086
I can't take this anymore.

266
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,472
If I don't get an apple soon, I don't know what...

267
00:15:06,497 --> 00:15:10,067
In the end, I just have to get
through this, no matter what.

268
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:12,227
You know what, Mr. Stalker?

269
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:16,194
Your video won't sell if it's
just me sitting here the whole time.

270
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,176
Mr. Yagami looks pretty bad.

271
00:15:21,302 --> 00:15:23,736
I think he's taking this harder than Light or Misa.

272
00:15:23,803 --> 00:15:25,001
Well, what do you expect?

273
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:27,280
It's been five days since Light was put in prison.

274
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,686
And look, not a single criminal who's
name has been broadcast was killed.

275
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,309
In these situations, I think the parents
must suffer a lot more than the accused.

276
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:37,167
No kidding.

277
00:15:37,192 --> 00:15:40,063
Especially now that we're seeing proof that Light is Kira.

278
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:43,109
Mr. Yagami?

279
00:15:43,228 --> 00:15:46,557
What is it? Is it good news? Is it bad news?

280
00:15:47,803 --> 00:15:50,724
No, I wanted to tell you not to worry so much.

281
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,134
It doesn't matter how much time
you devote to worrying about this.

282
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:55,652
The outcome will be the same.

283
00:15:55,696 --> 00:15:57,663
This could go on for quite some time.

284
00:15:57,986 --> 00:16:00,224
Perhaps you should rest in a more comfortable place.

285
00:16:00,855 --> 00:16:01,711
Impossible!

286
00:16:01,736 --> 00:16:03,417
What makes you think I care where I am?

287
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:04,677
It won't change anything.

288
00:16:05,016 --> 00:16:08,021
With the state I'm in now, this is the best place for me.

289
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:10,959
And no matter what the result, when I leave here,

290
00:16:10,984 --> 00:16:13,165
it's going to be with my son.

291
00:16:14,528 --> 00:16:15,830
I understand.

292
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:30,829
Light, you've only been here for one week,

293
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:32,704
but I'm sure it can't be easy.

294
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:34,276
Are you feeling all right?

295
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:40,327
Now that I've come this far,

296
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:42,184
I think it's about time.

297
00:16:48,486 --> 00:16:51,288
Yeah, I know I must look pretty bad in here.

298
00:16:51,313 --> 00:16:55,342
But this useless pride, I suppose I'll have to...

299
00:16:56,811 --> 00:16:58,005
get rid of it.

300
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,060
Huh?

301
00:17:12,661 --> 00:17:13,413
Got it.

302
00:17:20,469 --> 00:17:21,096
Later.

303
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:31,079
Hm?

304
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:35,503
Why am I doing this? I don't belong here.

305
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:42,215
Ryuzaki, I realize that I was the one pushing for
confinement and that I asked you to put me in here,

306
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,442
but I just realized something important.

307
00:17:44,467 --> 00:17:46,367
This whole thing is completely pointless.

308
00:17:46,486 --> 00:17:47,228
Huh?

309
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:49,369
Because I'm not Kira!

310
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:51,542
You have to get me out of here.

311
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:52,749
Hm.

312
00:17:53,194 --> 00:17:54,294
I can't do that.

313
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:56,078
I promised you that no matter what you said,

314
00:17:56,103 --> 00:17:59,601
I wouldn't let you out until I
was convinced that you are not Kira.

315
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,799
Please, L. I wasn't thinking clearly.

316
00:18:02,837 --> 00:18:05,407
Do you really think a serial killer like Kira

317
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:08,346
could commit those crimes without being aware of them?

318
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:11,876
If I have no memory of his crimes, I'm not him.

319
00:18:12,627 --> 00:18:14,684
I've never been able to accept this idea

320
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:17,776
that Kira has been acting without
self awareness all this time.

321
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:22,449
But that doesn't change the fact that
all the evidence point to you being Kira.

322
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,411
Since we imprisoned you,

323
00:18:24,444 --> 00:18:26,890
Kira hasn't committed a single murder.

324
00:18:27,702 --> 00:18:30,032
Listen, just hear me out.

325
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:33,127
I swear to you, I'm not lying. You have to believe me.

326
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:34,878
I'm not Kira!

327
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,153
I must have been framed.

328
00:18:36,178 --> 00:18:38,226
That's the only explanation for this.

329
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,442
What's wrong with you, Light Yagami.

330
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:42,809
What you're saying is completely absurd.

331
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:46,449
But for some reason, it feels believable to me.

332
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:49,207
You have to let me out! We're wasting time!

333
00:18:49,303 --> 00:18:51,644
We can't let you out yet.

334
00:18:52,428 --> 00:18:53,203
Damn.

335
00:18:53,461 --> 00:18:54,924
Why is this happening?

336
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,109
What the hell is going on?

337
00:18:57,134 --> 00:18:58,740
This isn't like Light at all.

338
00:18:58,911 --> 00:19:00,446
He's contradicting himself.

339
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,660
It doesn't make any sense to me.

340
00:19:02,745 --> 00:19:05,217
Well, we can't release him now
that the murders have stopped.

341
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:07,461
It doesn't matter what he says.

342
00:19:07,777 --> 00:19:10,165
I mean, even I know that much.

343
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:12,301
Anyway, I don't care what anyone says.

344
00:19:12,326 --> 00:19:14,896
As far as I'm concerned, we have all the proof we need.

345
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:17,336
Light Yagami is Kira, and that's the end of it.

346
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:24,965
What's going on? I just heard.

347
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,700
Two weeks' worth of criminals
were just murdered all at once.

348
00:19:27,725 --> 00:19:28,792
It happened yesterday.

349
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:29,648
Yeah.

350
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,506
Kira is back.

351
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:33,415
So did you guys already tell the chief?

352
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:35,304
No, not yet.

353
00:19:36,445 --> 00:19:39,197
Guess what, Chief? Kira started killing again!

354
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:39,935
What?

355
00:19:40,093 --> 00:19:42,165
It looks like Kira was only resting.

356
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:44,623
But now he's started punishing criminals again.

357
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:46,742
Is that true, Matsuda?

358
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,500
Then that means my son...

359
00:19:49,775 --> 00:19:51,856
I shouldn't be happy that people have been killed.

360
00:19:51,881 --> 00:19:55,271
But at least Light's name will finally be cleared.

361
00:19:55,296 --> 00:19:59,277
Wait, knowing Ryuzaki, this won't be enough to clear him.

362
00:20:00,395 --> 00:20:01,352
Huh?

363
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:04,708
Well, he's in the grey.

364
00:20:04,744 --> 00:20:06,498
Did you hear what he just said, Chief?

365
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:10,321
Yeah, it's a hell of a lot better
than being completely guilty, thank god.

366
00:20:10,346 --> 00:20:13,554
I'm sure as greys go, he's a
shade closer to being cleared.

367
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:14,415
Let's tell Light!

368
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,519
Matsuda!

369
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:18,098
I mean, please don't, Mr. Matsuda.

370
00:20:18,144 --> 00:20:19,004
Matsuda?

371
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:21,829
We shouldn't tell him about this.

372
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,969
But... But why not?

373
00:20:24,653 --> 00:20:25,625
Hello, Light.

374
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:27,648
What is it, Ryuzaki?

375
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:32,579
You've been here just over two weeks and
not a single new criminal has been punished.

376
00:20:32,928 --> 00:20:35,128
Now, why make this harder than it has to be?

377
00:20:35,153 --> 00:20:36,475
Are you ready to confess?

378
00:20:36,677 --> 00:20:38,258
Don't be ridiculous.

379
00:20:38,361 --> 00:20:40,128
I'm telling you, you're wrong.

380
00:20:40,211 --> 00:20:42,078
I understand why you feel that way.

381
00:20:42,103 --> 00:20:45,537
But even if the evidence does point
to me, I swear to you, this is a set up.

382
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,343
I am not Kira!

383
00:20:47,793 --> 00:20:49,293
Zoom in on me, if you want.

384
00:20:49,318 --> 00:20:50,998
Go ahead, look at my eyes.

385
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,883
You tell me, do these look like
the eyes of someone who is lying?

386
00:20:55,862 --> 00:20:56,898
Hm.

387
00:20:57,546 --> 00:21:01,465
Amane, are you ready to tell me who Kira is, or not?

388
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:04,577
Huh? That again?

389
00:21:04,602 --> 00:21:06,300
I wish I knew, but I don't.

390
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:11,115
Because if I did, I'd thank him for
punishing the burglar who killed my parents.

391
00:21:11,212 --> 00:21:13,008
To me, Kira is a hero.

392
00:21:17,869 --> 00:21:21,777
I don't understand what's going on here.

393
00:22:38,396 --> 00:22:40,384
That... That's crazy.

394
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:41,409
Wait, Dad.

395
00:22:41,434 --> 00:22:44,313
If I die here, then the truth will never be revealed!

396
00:22:44,424 --> 00:22:47,027
Do you trust L more than your own son?

397
00:22:47,276 --> 00:22:48,285
Dad!
