1
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,237
Uh.

2
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,849
Huh?

3
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:39,104
Huh?

4
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:41,874
I am L.

5
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:43,803
This is him?

6
00:01:43,962 --> 00:01:44,747
Hm.

7
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:46,391
He's nothing like I thought he'd be.

8
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:48,975
Hm.

9
00:01:50,086 --> 00:01:52,432
I'm Yagami of the NPA.

10
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:53,928
Uh, Matsuda.

11
00:01:53,953 --> 00:01:55,058
I'm Aizawa.

12
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:55,861
Mogi.

13
00:01:55,924 --> 00:01:56,774
Ukita.

14
00:01:58,346 --> 00:01:59,846
I'm very sorry we're late.

15
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,664
Currently the five of us are...

16
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:02,566
Bang.

17
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:03,195
Uh!

18
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:03,896
Wha?

19
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,505
What the hell was that?

20
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,366
Hm.

21
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,263
If I were Kira, you'd be dead,
Mr. Soichiro Yagami, chief of the NPA.

22
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:12,305
Wha?

23
00:02:12,447 --> 00:02:15,780
Kira needs a face and a name in order to commit murder.

24
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,780
But I'm sure you've already
figured that much out, haven't you?

25
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:22,361
Please do not give out your names so carelessly.

26
00:02:22,628 --> 00:02:26,246
Instead, let's value our lives.

27
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,280
I knew that he needed a face to kill someone,

28
00:02:28,305 --> 00:02:31,447
but I don't remember any evidence
that showed that he needed a name, too.

29
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:33,626
There's no way to verify if this is related,

30
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:36,303
but criminals whose names were never released publicly

31
00:02:36,328 --> 00:02:40,131
or whose names were spelled incorrectly
in the media have not been targeted.

32
00:02:40,312 --> 00:02:43,014
We briefly went over it at one of our meetings.

33
00:02:43,523 --> 00:02:46,171
That's enough small talk for now. Come this way.

34
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:47,680
Oh, uh, right.

35
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:52,091
Please turn off all your cellphones,
handhelds, and any other communication devices

36
00:02:52,116 --> 00:02:54,010
and leave them on the table right there.

37
00:02:55,313 --> 00:02:59,391
What, do you think we're going to be using our
cellphones during this meeting to leak information?

38
00:02:59,427 --> 00:03:01,476
It's all right. Just do as he says.

39
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:05,202
I realize he's been cautious from the very beginning,

40
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,434
but I still can't tell if he trusts us or not.

41
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:09,385
No, I just find them distracting.

42
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,961
I can't stand it when people's cell
phones are ringing while I'm trying to talk.

43
00:03:14,384 --> 00:03:18,535
Let me start by saying nobody takes notes
on anything that's said in these meetings.

44
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:22,600
That means when we leave headquarters, any
information we need is committed to memory.

45
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,530
Please, make yourselves comfortable.

46
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:27,934
Uh, right.

47
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,019
Mm.

48
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,579
Excuse me, L?

49
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:53,495
Mm. And from now on, I'll have
to ask that you stop calling me L.

50
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,728
It's Ryuzaki now, just to be safe.

51
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,496
Uh, OK, Ryuzaki.

52
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,549
If we know that he needs a name and a face to kill,

53
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:05,460
couldn't we cut down on the number of victims
by keeping criminals' names from the news?

54
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,929
If we do that, we'll only be
putting the general public at risk.

55
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:10,380
The general public?

56
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:11,153
Why?

57
00:04:13,342 --> 00:04:16,109
Kira is childish and he hates losing.

58
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:17,251
But how do you...

59
00:04:17,276 --> 00:04:18,730
Just what do you mean?

60
00:04:19,194 --> 00:04:22,761
Well, I'm also childish and I hate to lose.

61
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,324
That's how I know.

62
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,119
Ryuzaki, would you mind being
a little more specific for us?

63
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:34,573
Early on in the investigation, I tried
to provoke Kira with that broadcast.

64
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:38,695
Up until then we thought that
Kira would only go after criminals,

65
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,358
but as we all witnessed,

66
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:43,109
he didn't hesitate to kill my standin.

67
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:46,331
Also, as soon as I said we
knew he was in the Kanto region,

68
00:04:46,356 --> 00:04:50,118
in defiance he made sure his
next victims came from within Japan,

69
00:04:50,181 --> 00:04:51,486
as if to say,

70
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:53,047
and what are you going to do about it?

71
00:04:55,493 --> 00:05:00,351
He's met each of my challenges headon and he's
never missed an opportunity to return the favor.

72
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:02,225
Now what do you think would happen

73
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,702
if we tried to use media restrictions
to hide criminals from someone like that?

74
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:08,371
I guess

75
00:05:08,413 --> 00:05:11,622
"If you choose to withhold the
names of your worst criminals,

76
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:14,095
I'll kill petty criminals or the innocent.

77
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,238
I'm holding the whole world hostage, so who's it gonna be?

78
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,841
I'm not the evil one here, but all
those who oppose me by hiding criminals?

79
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:23,898
You are truly evil."

80
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,583
That's exactly how Kira thinks.

81
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:32,093
In any case, let's look at another
way we can use the media to draw him out.

82
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:33,633
But how?

83
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:36,033
How about something like this?

84
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,812
"Death of FBI agents infuriates the US.

85
00:05:39,837 --> 00:05:42,753
Latest killings anger the
international policing community.

86
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:46,138
Nations agree to send 1,500 investigators to Japan."

87
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:50,083
For Kira, this will be way
beyond what he faced with the FBI.

88
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,618
He'll see everyone as a potential threat.

89
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,216
Psychologically he'll start to feel cornered,

90
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:58,207
and that will cause him to
take some kind of drastic action.

91
00:05:59,074 --> 00:06:00,296
That that's interesting.

92
00:06:00,437 --> 00:06:04,473
So he'll think there are 1,500 when
there are really only seven of us.

93
00:06:04,642 --> 00:06:08,505
And since none of these investigators
exists, Kira won't be able to kill them.

94
00:06:08,587 --> 00:06:09,927
It just might work.

95
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:15,033
Well, before we celebrate, I'll tell you
the rest of my thoughts on the Kira case.

96
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,862
Kira works alone.

97
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:22,172
He had access to all our classified information.

98
00:06:22,952 --> 00:06:25,419
What evidence do you have that he's working alone?

99
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:26,542
Hold on, Aizawa.

100
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:29,477
Let's listen to his entire theory before asking questions.

101
00:06:30,304 --> 00:06:33,137
We know he needs a name and a face to kill,

102
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:38,063
and to some extent, he can control a victim's
time of death and their actions before dying.

103
00:06:38,794 --> 00:06:40,328
We already know that much.

104
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,166
Please keep that in mind...

105
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:45,466
and listen carefully to what I have to say next.

106
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:50,753
On December 14, 12 FBI investigators enter Japan.

107
00:06:53,628 --> 00:06:55,867
Here we are on December 19.

108
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:59,242
Using prison inmates, Kira conducts experiments,

109
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:01,869
manipulating his victims' actions before they die.

110
00:07:01,995 --> 00:07:05,134
In other words, during this window of only five days,

111
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:09,769
Kira became aware of the FBI's
presence and obviously felt threatened.

112
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:14,283
Because he didn't know any of their
names or faces, he was at a disadvantage.

113
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:17,694
He needed to know how much control he had over his victims

114
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:20,256
before he could use it against the 12 agents.

115
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,103
And as we all know, on December 27.

116
00:07:24,138 --> 00:07:25,482
I got a hold of a file

117
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:30,037
which contained all the names and
faces of the FBI investigators in Japan

118
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:33,188
and I succeeded in killing each one of them.

119
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:37,442
It's practically impossible to guess
which agent gave the file to Kira,

120
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:41,008
but I have to make sure that no one ever finds out

121
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:43,711
that I came into contact with Raye Pember.

122
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:48,102
Huh?

123
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:50,265
How come you're not using the Death Note today?

124
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,538
You studying for those entrance exams?

125
00:07:52,563 --> 00:07:54,107
Those are the least of my worries.

126
00:07:54,132 --> 00:07:56,029
Plus, it's a little late to start now.

127
00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:58,114
Oh? What you doing?

128
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,874
December 19 to December 27.

129
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,049
I've been most active during this period.

130
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:09,803
During this period, to the best of our knowledge,
at least 23 individuals died of heart attacks.

131
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,870
But these victims were different
from Kira's previous targets.

132
00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:18,434
They were all alleged criminals, exconvicts,
or suspects in ongoing investigations.

133
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:20,369
So legally speaking, they were innocent.

134
00:08:20,494 --> 00:08:21,775
That's true.

135
00:08:21,866 --> 00:08:23,777
What this indicates is that

136
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:28,330
Kira had to manipulate these lesser
criminals in order to kill those FBI agents.

137
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:30,164
He killed that many people

138
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:33,853
so we'd be unable to tell the decoys
from those who were actually used.

139
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:36,681
In truth, he probably only needed a few.

140
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:41,304
He waited eight days so the FBI
could investigate other suspects,

141
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:44,065
which meant there'd be no time
line linking him to their deaths.

142
00:08:44,313 --> 00:08:47,803
I suspect Kira had to be one
of the people being investigated

143
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:51,839
by the FBI between the 14th and the 19th of December.

144
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,684
In fact, I have no doubt.

145
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:58,438
These are files provided by the FBI,

146
00:08:58,463 --> 00:09:01,569
and they contain additional
information you might find useful.

147
00:09:01,594 --> 00:09:05,130
For obvious reasons, you're not permitted
to take these out of this room, but...

148
00:09:05,155 --> 00:09:06,145
Amazing!

149
00:09:06,236 --> 00:09:08,966
There might only be five of us, but with this information

150
00:09:08,991 --> 00:09:10,751
we should be able to cover a lot of ground.

151
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:12,184
We'll split into two teams.

152
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:14,109
One team traces the FBI agents.

153
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:15,934
The other looks at the heart attack victims.

154
00:09:16,012 --> 00:09:19,219
There weren't that many people who had
access to information from headquarters,

155
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:23,488
and of those, the FBI only investigated
a small group in the first five days.

156
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:24,959
Yeah. Yeah.

157
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,868
So does anyone have any questions?

158
00:09:27,893 --> 00:09:28,775
Uh?

159
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,178
Actually, Ryuzaki, I do have one question for you,

160
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:36,115
and it pertains to what you said to
us earlier about how you hate to lose.

161
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,690
Is the fact that you've shown us
your face mean that you've lost?

162
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:41,548
By just being here, are you admitting defeat to Kira?

163
00:09:41,907 --> 00:09:42,795
That's right.

164
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:47,548
By showing my face to you now and by
sacrificing the lives of 12 FBI agents,

165
00:09:47,573 --> 00:09:48,950
I have lost the battle.

166
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:51,592
But I'm not going to lose the war.

167
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:54,736
This is the first time I've ever put my life on the line.

168
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,711
I want to show Kira that we're all willing
to risk our lives if that's what it takes,

169
00:10:00,605 --> 00:10:03,086
and that justice will prevail no matter what.

170
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:05,665
Hey, yeah, that's right.

171
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,998
I like the sound of that.

172
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,257
We can do this.

173
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:10,415
All right, then. Let's do this, Ryuzaki.

174
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,598
Well, I had my doubts about
whether it was really him at first,

175
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:18,358
but there's no mistaking it. This man is L.

176
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:22,855
Before we go any further, I have to be
absolutely sure that none of you are Kira,

177
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,102
so I'll need to speak with each of
you individually before you leave today.

178
00:10:26,816 --> 00:10:27,490
Huh.

179
00:10:28,284 --> 00:10:30,462
What's the deal? He still doesn't trust us?

180
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:32,547
No, I think it's a fair request.

181
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:34,543
Try to see it from his perspective.

182
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:38,033
Kira's been getting information from
our headquarters from the very beginning,

183
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:40,304
so there's a good chance that he's one of us.

184
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:41,056
Chief's right.

185
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:43,681
Working this case has given us
a chance to see him in person.

186
00:10:44,194 --> 00:10:46,457
He's risking his life to be here.

187
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,008
Things are going well.

188
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,364
Just one clue, a single decisive factor's all I need.

189
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:56,863
Just one oversight.

190
00:10:57,381 --> 00:11:00,278
A single piece of evidence is all it would take.

191
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:03,177
It could cost me my life.

192
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:05,516
Just one thing.

193
00:11:28,215 --> 00:11:29,984
You already finished studying?

194
00:11:30,474 --> 00:11:31,558
I guess.

195
00:11:32,576 --> 00:11:33,755
I'll be fine.

196
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,432
I haven't missed anything.

197
00:11:35,457 --> 00:11:39,026
The biggest risk I've taken so
far was that busjacking incident.

198
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:41,654
But they'll never be able to connect it with Kira.

199
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,612
Fortunately for me, both the police and L don't know that

200
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:48,784
Kira can kill people by means other than a heart attack.

201
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,330
However, if anyone were to discover that fact,

202
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:53,902
I'd be in a lot of trouble.

203
00:11:53,927 --> 00:11:54,942
What?

204
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,590
Does it have to be now?

205
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,391
Your father's been pulling
overnighters with no change of clothes,

206
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,938
so you're going to bring these to him.

207
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:04,421
But Mom, I totally promised my
friends that I'd go out with them today.

208
00:12:04,446 --> 00:12:05,563
Why don't I go?

209
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:06,839
I could use a break.

210
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:10,271
Thanks, Light. I owe you one next time.

211
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,799
So I guess this will give you
a chance to spy on the police.

212
00:12:13,824 --> 00:12:16,031
I won't go further than the reception desk.

213
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,762
Oh, you're bringing a page.

214
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:24,142
Planning to kill someone?

215
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:28,837
No, but lately I've been bringing a page
with me every time I go out, just in case.

216
00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:35,830
That day...

217
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:39,052
Raye said he was planning to go to Shinjuku.

218
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:45,758
That same day four people died of
heart attacks in the Shinjuku area,

219
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:48,605
and there was the busjacking.

220
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,409
There's no way it was a coincidence.

221
00:12:59,971 --> 00:13:00,882
That's it!

222
00:13:01,099 --> 00:13:03,022
Kira can kill in other ways.

223
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:05,079
It doesn't have to be a heart attack.

224
00:13:06,462 --> 00:13:08,406
The mobile customer you are trying
to reach is currently unavailable.

225
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:09,917
That's unusual for Dad.

226
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,857
I wonder if he's in a meeting right now.

227
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:22,446
Please, I need to speak directly with someone
from the special investigation task force.

228
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:23,379
It's urgent.

229
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:25,319
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I can't help you.

230
00:13:25,344 --> 00:13:29,008
As I've told you already, there is no
one at task force headquarters right now.

231
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:31,262
There's no one at headquarters?

232
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,251
Dad's cell is turned off.

233
00:13:33,631 --> 00:13:34,814
What's going on?

234
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:37,364
Can't you contact them somehow?

235
00:13:37,404 --> 00:13:40,454
I have information relating to the Kira investigation.

236
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:42,521
The Kira investigation?

237
00:13:44,543 --> 00:13:47,418
Look, I'll call headquarters one more time for you.

238
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:48,608
One moment.

239
00:13:48,681 --> 00:13:52,161
Hi, I'm Detective Soichiro Yagami's son, Light Yagami.

240
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:55,345
I brought my father a change of
clothes, but it doesn't look like he's in.

241
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,432
Can I leave them here?

242
00:13:56,457 --> 00:13:58,811
Sure. Hey, I haven't seen you in a while, Light.

243
00:13:58,836 --> 00:14:01,169
Oh, I'm sorry, uh...

244
00:14:01,194 --> 00:14:02,494
What, you don't remember?

245
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,836
You helped solve the insurance fraud murder investigation

246
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:05,990
sometime last year.

247
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,638
But hey, no one remembers the receptionist, do they?

248
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:11,407
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terrible with faces.

249
00:14:11,432 --> 00:14:13,732
I just need to sign my name on this form, right?

250
00:14:13,757 --> 00:14:17,776
So, Light, does this mean you're going to be
helping us with the Kira investigation, too?

251
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:21,120
Sure. If all goes well, maybe
I'll find Kira before L does.

252
00:14:21,145 --> 00:14:22,829
Find him before L does?

253
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,888
As I thought, there's no one at headquarters.

254
00:14:25,913 --> 00:14:27,471
You're going to have to trust me on this, ma'am.

255
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:30,466
I'll be sure to give them your
message as soon as I see them. I promise.

256
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:33,164
That's not good enough. I have to tell them in person.

257
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:34,279
Excuse me.

258
00:14:34,471 --> 00:14:37,957
My father is actually in charge of the Kira investigation.

259
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:40,282
If you'd like, I could pass your message on to him.

260
00:14:40,307 --> 00:14:43,784
His cell phone is off at the moment,
but I should be able to contact him soon.

261
00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:47,136
A number of FBI agents were just killed,

262
00:14:47,161 --> 00:14:50,561
and a lot of detectives have quit
the case because they're afraid of Kira.

263
00:14:50,814 --> 00:14:52,597
So he's pretty busy right now.

264
00:14:52,622 --> 00:14:56,041
Uh, Light, it's probably better
if you don't discuss this with...

265
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:59,235
True, but it's practically common knowledge at this point.

266
00:14:59,307 --> 00:15:01,473
Besides, I feel like I can trust her.

267
00:15:01,498 --> 00:15:03,723
You can almost see it in her eyes.

268
00:15:03,748 --> 00:15:05,791
She's a wise and careful person.

269
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:08,092
You heard about what happened

270
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:11,155
and you must have figured out that
the police had a leak of some kind,

271
00:15:11,752 --> 00:15:14,119
and that's why you wanted to tell them in person.

272
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:17,776
You've thought this through. Well, am I right?

273
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,412
I'm sure my father will be calling
me back once he checks his messages.

274
00:15:24,446 --> 00:15:26,975
When he does, I'll give you
the phone and let you talk to him.

275
00:15:28,504 --> 00:15:29,913
You're sure that's all right?

276
00:15:30,071 --> 00:15:31,121
Oh, yeah.

277
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:34,122
You understand why I can't just
give you my father's cell phone number.

278
00:15:34,147 --> 00:15:37,237
But I have no problem letting
you use my phone to talk to him.

279
00:15:37,262 --> 00:15:41,587
You'll have to trust my father and I,
which I hope won't be too difficult for you.

280
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:45,431
Why is he so happy?

281
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:48,467
Thank you so much.

282
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:52,684
She walked right into that one, didn't she?

283
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:56,393
I've got to say,

284
00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:00,503
you must be pretty brave to be getting
involved in the Kira case like this.

285
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:02,038
Hmph, not really.

286
00:16:02,063 --> 00:16:04,326
So according to you, is Kira some...

287
00:16:06,371 --> 00:16:10,280
Um, we've been talking and I just
realized I don't even know your name.

288
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:12,005
My name is Light Yagami.

289
00:16:12,195 --> 00:16:16,589
Light's written with the character for moon,
and Yagami with the characters for night and god.

290
00:16:16,614 --> 00:16:17,948
Kind of weird, huh?

291
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:19,960
My name's Shoko Maki.

292
00:16:19,985 --> 00:16:21,782
It's written with the characters for shining,

293
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:23,907
"ko" as in "child," "space," and "ki" as in "tree."

294
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:25,722
Miss Maki, right?

295
00:16:28,247 --> 00:16:31,764
Miss Maki, I've been thinking about Kira's powers,

296
00:16:32,128 --> 00:16:36,279
and I believe they enable him to somehow
control his victims before they die.

297
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,720
So do I!

298
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:41,181
It's odd that you say that, because
that's exactly what I've been thinking.

299
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:44,253
Kira's able to control their actions before he kills them,

300
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:45,485
but there's more to it.

301
00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:47,815
If my analysis so far is correct,

302
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:51,452
Kira can kill in a number of
ways, not just with a heart attack.

303
00:16:52,514 --> 00:16:53,742
She knows?

304
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,230
Who is this woman?

305
00:16:56,071 --> 00:16:58,618
I don't think anyone else knows this yet,

306
00:16:59,109 --> 00:17:01,278
but if the police are willing to consider it

307
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:03,247
I bet it would help them catch Kira.

308
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,367
You know, that possibility never even crossed my mind.

309
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:10,521
So what you're saying is any time Kira
wants one of his murders to go undetected,

310
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:12,434
he wouldn't use a heart attack.

311
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:13,269
Right.

312
00:17:13,605 --> 00:17:16,607
I'm almost positive that someone I know may have met Kira.

313
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:18,623
Met Kira?

314
00:17:20,218 --> 00:17:23,312
I'm sorry, but if a person came in saying they'd met Kira,

315
00:17:23,337 --> 00:17:26,572
the police would be more than a
little skeptical, to say the least.

316
00:17:26,705 --> 00:17:27,768
I know.

317
00:17:27,793 --> 00:17:31,618
That's why I need to explain it in person
to someone from task force headquarters.

318
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:33,565
Otherwise I'm afraid they'll just write me off.

319
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,692
But wouldn't it be better if
your friend spoke to them instead?

320
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:40,329
It probably would, but he's no longer alive.

321
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:44,729
He was one of the 12 FBI agents
who came to Japan to investigate Kira.

322
00:17:46,242 --> 00:17:49,652
An FBI agent who met Kira?

323
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:51,523
Could it be?

324
00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:54,484
You see, he was also my fiance.

325
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:57,030
While he was working he got caught up in a busjacking,

326
00:17:57,055 --> 00:18:00,209
and I have reason to believe that he met Kira on that bus.

327
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:03,753
Raye Penber.

328
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:10,961
Is something wrong?

329
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:14,263
Nothing. I'm sorry to hear that he passed away.

330
00:18:16,376 --> 00:18:19,621
So what makes you think he met Kira on that bus?

331
00:18:21,193 --> 00:18:23,691
Because eight days after that bus was hijacked,

332
00:18:24,718 --> 00:18:27,770
he died along with the other FBI investigators.

333
00:18:28,305 --> 00:18:32,333
The same man had attempted to rob a
bank two days before he hijacked that bus,

334
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:35,221
then he dies in an accident, just like that?

335
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,803
I mean, really, what are the odds?

336
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,719
I've come to believe that Kira set up that busjacking.

337
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,733
It was planned to bring him into contact with my fiance

338
00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:49,246
in order to obtain information regarding
the identities of the other FBI agents

339
00:18:49,271 --> 00:18:50,873
so he could get rid of them all.

340
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:55,152
Anyway, what stands out to me is
that the hijacker died in an accident.

341
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,202
In other words,

342
00:18:56,527 --> 00:19:00,147
it suggests that heart attacks aren't
the only way Kira can kill people.

343
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,652
OK, so the busjacker didn't die of a heart attack.

344
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:18,879
And based on that, you're saying
Kira has other ways of killing people?

345
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:20,052
Yes.

346
00:19:20,647 --> 00:19:24,256
Don't take this the wrong way, but I
think that's a bit of a leap of faith.

347
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:26,696
There's no other way of looking at it.

348
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:30,456
If Kira was controlling the
hijacker, chances are he killed him too.

349
00:19:30,976 --> 00:19:32,283
I still don't see it.

350
00:19:32,343 --> 00:19:36,419
I've been wondering about that busjacking
ever since my fiance first told me about it.

351
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:39,398
After he calmed down, I asked him for details.

352
00:19:40,594 --> 00:19:42,941
He didn't mention any names or anything like that,

353
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:44,433
but he told me one thing.

354
00:19:44,571 --> 00:19:45,787
What did he say?

355
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:49,912
That he'd been put in a situation where
he had to show his FBI ID to someone.

356
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,369
Hm.

357
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:58,431
The operation was undertaken
secretly without the NPA's knowledge.

358
00:19:58,456 --> 00:20:00,616
He wasn't allowed to show his ID.

359
00:20:01,018 --> 00:20:06,442
I think whoever saw his ID that day is
responsible for the deaths of all the agents.

360
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:08,780
Unbelievable.

361
00:20:08,852 --> 00:20:10,352
She figured it out.

362
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,061
This must be the oversight Light was worried about.

363
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:14,485
I understand.

364
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,434
You're the only one who knows any of this

365
00:20:16,459 --> 00:20:20,563
and you want nothing more than to avenge
your fiance by bringing Kira to justice, right?

366
00:20:20,676 --> 00:20:24,201
And now you're convinced that Kira
can kill without using a heart attack.

367
00:20:24,328 --> 00:20:25,024
Yes.

368
00:20:25,895 --> 00:20:28,920
There's no doubt in my mind your
deductive skills are excellent,

369
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:31,834
but you can't deny that you have
a personal interest in the case.

370
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:36,459
Still, your theory is worth looking into, that's for sure.

371
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:39,297
Your testimony could be central to the case.

372
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:40,575
It could.

373
00:20:41,143 --> 00:20:42,811
If what you're telling me is true,

374
00:20:42,836 --> 00:20:46,309
then it'll only be a matter of time
before the police catch up with Kira.

375
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:50,826
The person your fiance showed
his ID to on the bus that day...

376
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:53,104
it had to be Kira.

377
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:54,571
That's right.

378
00:21:01,356 --> 00:21:02,822
That was close.

379
00:21:03,778 --> 00:21:04,872
This woman,

380
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,545
if she'd spoken to the police before I met her

381
00:21:08,908 --> 00:21:12,805
but it seems there's a god on my side after all,

382
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:15,719
and not just a god of death.

383
00:22:38,312 --> 00:22:39,745
I have to admit

384
00:22:39,907 --> 00:22:42,383
I'd really love to see how she dies,

385
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:45,159
but I can't be caught following her around.

386
00:22:45,371 --> 00:22:46,444
Go on.

387
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:48,500
Hurry to your death.
