1
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:36,934
I think we should do this every day.

2
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:38,959
The sun will do you good.

3
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:51,790
What in the world... am I supposed to do now?

4
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:08,522
Ah.

5
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:09,991
Mm.

6
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:13,143
Mmhm.

7
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:16,324
Hi, Ryuk.

8
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:21,612
Sidoh?

9
00:02:21,903 --> 00:02:23,485
Wh... What are you doing here?

10
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,062
Hey. Quit following me.

11
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:33,532
I want my notebook.

12
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:36,350
Damn. Guess I shouldn't be surprised.

13
00:02:36,702 --> 00:02:37,578
Too bad.

14
00:02:37,836 --> 00:02:40,348
Things got a little complicated recently.

15
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:42,865
I have no idea where it is.

16
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:44,969
Why am I not surprised?

17
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:51,172
Look! I told you. Stop following me!

18
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:52,723
Then give me back my notebook.

19
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:54,697
I don't know where it is.

20
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:59,740
If you want it back, you're
gonna have to look for it yourself.

21
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:01,749
Moron.

22
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:06,778
Wammy's House isn't exactly a normal orphanage.

23
00:03:07,198 --> 00:03:09,291
It's like a school for gifted children.

24
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:10,819
But here's the crazy part.

25
00:03:10,995 --> 00:03:15,525
Its real purpose is to groom these kids
so that one of them could become the next L.

26
00:03:15,977 --> 00:03:17,480
L's successor?

27
00:03:18,102 --> 00:03:22,327
Apparently, the one most likely
to succeed L is this kid named Near.

28
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:24,468
Near. Is that N?

29
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:28,076
Also, we found some leads on Mello, the one N mentioned.

30
00:03:28,162 --> 00:03:31,029
He's smart too, but he always came second to Near.

31
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:33,785
So Near was meant to be L's successor.

32
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,049
There's no mistake.

33
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:38,436
He has to be N. He's the one commanding the SPK.

34
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:42,118
As for Mello, he would've wanted to become L's successor,

35
00:03:42,143 --> 00:03:44,469
but he probably lost out to Near.

36
00:03:44,494 --> 00:03:48,231
That gives him a motive for wanting
to get his hands on the notebook first.

37
00:03:48,736 --> 00:03:50,735
It all adds up perfectly.

38
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:54,893
This guy is definitely the
same Mello that N told us about.

39
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:56,955
These are sketches of both of them.

40
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,219
We couldn't find any photographs.

41
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,546
L's successors.

42
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:07,038
It looks like I'm still fighting L after all this time.

43
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:11,100
First thing's first.

44
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,645
I have to find out where Mello and his
mafia associates are hiding themselves.

45
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:17,688
I already had Misa check a list of known mafia syndicates

46
00:04:17,773 --> 00:04:19,521
using her Shinigami eyes.

47
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:22,369
Look! I found him!

48
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:24,046
I can't see his lifespan.

49
00:04:24,118 --> 00:04:25,403
He's number 105.

50
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:28,956
They have him listed as Jack Neylon,
but his real name is Kal Snydar.

51
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,408
He's got the notebook.

52
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,131
After that, it was a simple matter of using
the Death Note to make Snyder send a letter to me

53
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:37,422
with the location of the gang's hideout.

54
00:04:37,447 --> 00:04:39,195
It should be arriving soon.

55
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,225
Hi Light!

56
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:44,480
Great news. The letter arrived.

57
00:04:45,714 --> 00:04:47,036
He's in LA.

58
00:04:47,305 --> 00:04:48,405
I did it.

59
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:51,070
I outmaneuvered both Near and Mello.

60
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:52,511
Guess it's no surprise.

61
00:04:52,536 --> 00:04:55,236
As long as I have the notebook and Misa's eyes,

62
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,126
I'm unstoppable.

63
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,632
So, Light.

64
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,640
I guess this means I was helpful to you again, doesn't it?

65
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:05,947
Yeah.

66
00:05:06,554 --> 00:05:08,322
I love you, Misa.

67
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:18,318
Los Ang... Ah... huh.

68
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:37,380
The next step is for me to figure out just
how much I can control people with this thing.

69
00:05:37,773 --> 00:05:42,531
Aw. They're gonna have to be able to
see me before I can even talk to them.

70
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:44,121
What a drag.

71
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:48,108
Looks like Snyder's the owner right now.

72
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:51,534
Guess I'll have to make him touch the notebook first.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,447
Oh well.

74
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,530
Tag, you're it.

75
00:05:58,636 --> 00:06:01,642
The... uh, the notebook just flew.

76
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:05,005
Ha. It's a notebook that kills people.

77
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:06,983
Hell, nothing surprises me anymore.

78
00:06:08,896 --> 00:06:10,414
Boss! Who is this?

79
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:12,974
The guy in the freaky costume? Who the hell is he?

80
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,399
Who brought him here?

81
00:06:14,424 --> 00:06:17,420
I came here on my own. I'm actually a Shinigami.

82
00:06:17,617 --> 00:06:19,087
A Shinigami?

83
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:23,418
If you don't want everyone to think you're crazy,

84
00:06:23,553 --> 00:06:26,672
pass the notebook around, so they can see me too.

85
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,082
He says you can see him if you touch the notebook!

86
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,535
Please. Everyone touch it.

87
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:35,119
I swear I'm not crazy!

88
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:38,925
Fine, whatever.

89
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,271
Come on, guys.

90
00:06:40,448 --> 00:06:42,059
Touch the notebook.

91
00:06:44,185 --> 00:06:46,259
He wasn't there the last time I touched him!

92
00:06:46,284 --> 00:06:47,293
Should I kill him?

93
00:06:52,387 --> 00:06:53,621
Nice try.

94
00:06:53,673 --> 00:06:55,724
You humans can't kill a Shinigami.

95
00:06:57,592 --> 00:06:58,556
Jack's right.

96
00:06:58,717 --> 00:07:00,063
That ain't no costume.

97
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:02,355
That's a real, live Shinigami.

98
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,613
So now what do we do?

99
00:07:04,915 --> 00:07:05,594
Ryuk.

100
00:07:06,436 --> 00:07:09,940
As of now, I'm going to forfeit
ownership of this notebook.

101
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:14,398
All I ask is that you agree to
follow whichever person I give it to.

102
00:07:14,549 --> 00:07:17,037
What? You're giving up ownership again?

103
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:17,724
But wait.

104
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:20,132
Won't you lose all your memories if you do that?

105
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:22,380
Misa, lend me your notebook.

106
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:25,301
I'll keep it on me like this.

107
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:29,370
That way, even if I forfeit ownership
of my notebook, I won't lose my memory.

108
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:31,252
I'll give you as many pages as you need.

109
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,817
From this moment on, you're going to be Kira.

110
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:34,952
Can you do that?

111
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:36,154
Of course. But...

112
00:07:37,336 --> 00:07:39,197
I don't get why you're doing this.

113
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:41,886
I'll explain everything to you right now.

114
00:07:42,408 --> 00:07:44,325
I won't forgive any mistakes.

115
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,842
Chocolate is so good.

116
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:53,705
Hey. What about that stuff you told us? Is it true?

117
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:57,856
If the person using the note fails to
consecutively write names of people to be killed

118
00:07:57,881 --> 00:08:00,767
within 13 days of each other, then the user will die.

119
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,115
If you make this note unusable
by tearing it up or burning it,

120
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:06,875
all the human who have touched
the note until then will die.

121
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:08,798
Are you saying those two rules are made up?

122
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:13,509
Oh yeah, those rules are definitely fake.

123
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:18,777
My guess is, some Shinigami wrote those down
as a joke before giving the notebook to a human.

124
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:20,961
As for the 13 day rule,

125
00:08:21,313 --> 00:08:23,512
we can test that out by using one of our people.

126
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:25,415
But the real question is,

127
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,279
was this the notebook that was used by Kira?

128
00:08:28,603 --> 00:08:32,565
And if so, was he aware that these two rules were false?

129
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:36,541
If he did know, he could've
used these rules to his advantage.

130
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:42,699
In particular, the 13 day rule would've
allowed him to prove his innocence in only 13 days.

131
00:08:44,414 --> 00:08:46,960
Sidoh, go keep watch outside.

132
00:08:48,746 --> 00:08:51,927
It'll be very convenient for us
that you can't be seen be humans.

133
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:54,531
Go outside and keep watch. Got it?

134
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:56,869
What's with this guy?

135
00:08:56,894 --> 00:09:00,269
He's human, but he's scary.

136
00:09:06,969 --> 00:09:08,260
Yagami speaking.

137
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:10,215
This is Kira.

138
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:12,237
What did he say? Kira?

139
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:17,526
I understand the notebook that was in your
possession has fallen into criminal hands.

140
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:21,623
Can... Can you prove that you are the real Kira?

141
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:22,432
Prove it?

142
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:24,325
Now that there are others using the notebook,

143
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,660
there's no point predicting
killings in order to identify myself.

144
00:09:27,685 --> 00:09:30,518
They could just as easily kill the same targets.

145
00:09:30,592 --> 00:09:31,661
But don't worry.

146
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:33,386
I've already taken this into account.

147
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:37,155
I've sent you something that will
clearly prove to you that I am Kira.

148
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:39,081
It's my own notebook.

149
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:40,644
Wha... What do you mean?

150
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:45,532
The notebook I've sent you gives me the power
to know a person's name by seeing only their face,

151
00:09:45,557 --> 00:09:47,842
and you will be able to gain that same power.

152
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:48,962
Do you understand?

153
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:53,327
Please stay calm and listen carefully.

154
00:09:54,237 --> 00:09:57,973
I've gathered information from the FBI and other sources.

155
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:01,709
On November 10 at exactly 11:59 PM,

156
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:07,418
arrangements have been so that all
known associates of the mafia will die.

157
00:10:08,781 --> 00:10:10,698
It's already been written in my notebook,

158
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:13,001
so it's impossible for me to make any changes.

159
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:15,193
You will not be able to prevent these deaths.

160
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:16,740
I already know their location.

161
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:20,579
I will hand over that information
along with the notebook, so remember.

162
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:23,703
November 10th, 11:59 PM.

163
00:10:23,811 --> 00:10:25,395
That's when it all happens.

164
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,810
That moment is your best and only
chance to get the notebook back.

165
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:30,218
It's up to you.

166
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,173
What should we do?

167
00:10:49,252 --> 00:10:52,634
If the mafia members are going
to die on the day Kira specified,

168
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:54,558
it would be a chance to get the notebook back.

169
00:10:54,827 --> 00:10:58,093
I don't like the idea of following
Kira's plan, but it's our best option.

170
00:10:58,118 --> 00:10:59,330
Exactly.

171
00:11:04,927 --> 00:11:10,260
But still, knowing the time of death for these
guys isn't going to be enough for us to make our move.

172
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:13,801
Ide, I think we both know what needs to be done.

173
00:11:13,932 --> 00:11:15,736
We get the Shinigami to follow us in,

174
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:19,357
and... and then we do the deal for the
eyes, and make sure they're all dead. Right?

175
00:11:21,793 --> 00:11:23,751
I will make the deal for the eyes.

176
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:27,403
No way, Chief. Let me be the one to do it.

177
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:31,070
I was responsible for handing
over the notebook in the first place.

178
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:34,582
Since that moment, I've been
unable to live with what I've done.

179
00:11:34,615 --> 00:11:36,214
I've even thought of killing myself.

180
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,865
I'll use the notebook to kill
any criminals who try to stop this.

181
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:43,401
And then, after 13 days, I'll die as well.

182
00:11:45,123 --> 00:11:48,565
If Dad writes a name in the notebook, then,

183
00:11:48,927 --> 00:11:50,618
when the time comes...

184
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:01,481
Report.

185
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:03,527
Is everybody ready to move in?

186
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:04,437
Roger.

187
00:12:05,205 --> 00:12:06,088
All right.

188
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:11,915
Deputy director, make the eye deal with the Shinigami.

189
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:16,785
All right, Ryuk. I'm ready.

190
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,617
Sure thing, boss.

191
00:12:30,622 --> 00:12:31,875
Once you're finished,

192
00:12:32,138 --> 00:12:35,261
I want you to take a look at the
photographs of the criminals I gave you.

193
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:37,538
Can you see their names and lifespans?

194
00:12:37,635 --> 00:12:39,221
Yes. I can.

195
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:41,937
Their names should disappear soon.

196
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:42,868
That's your cue.

197
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:07,327
Everyone, move in!

198
00:13:21,038 --> 00:13:23,804
So, Kira is involved after all.

199
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:26,057
I didn't think he'd go this far.

200
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:28,434
My plan was supposed to be perfect.

201
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:30,802
Damn! What the hell is Sidoh doing?

202
00:13:31,638 --> 00:13:34,317
Relax, Sidoh. Just shut up and watch, all right?

203
00:13:34,678 --> 00:13:36,878
All you have to do is sit here and do nothing.

204
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:39,371
If you can do that, you'll get your notebook back.

205
00:13:43,216 --> 00:13:46,300
Roy, Skiier, the notebook's under Rod's body.

206
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,546
Bring it to the surveillance room upstairs.

207
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:01,054
Don't move!

208
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:11,372
L, we apprehended two of the criminals.

209
00:14:11,397 --> 00:14:13,345
We've also been able to secure the notebook.

210
00:14:13,982 --> 00:14:15,522
We'll begin withdrawing now.

211
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:18,250
Not yet. Keep going.

212
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,345
Huh? What?

213
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:23,608
We still haven't found anyone
who resembles our picture of Mello.

214
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:25,981
That means he must be hiding somewhere in the building.

215
00:14:26,989 --> 00:14:28,430
We've come this far.

216
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,750
Let's finish this. Do a thorough search.

217
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:46,745
Ah!

218
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:47,589
What was that?

219
00:14:47,614 --> 00:14:48,537
An explosion.

220
00:14:49,904 --> 00:14:51,285
Don't move.

221
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:54,078
I've already blown up the two entrances to this place.

222
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,024
This will be your only warning.

223
00:14:56,186 --> 00:15:00,081
The next explosion will take out the entire
building, as well as all your men inside.

224
00:15:00,596 --> 00:15:02,520
So you'd better do as I say.

225
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:05,113
It's Mello.

226
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:09,946
Hm?

227
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,772
Yagami again, huh?

228
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:14,902
Maybe I should have killed you when I had the chance.

229
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:16,736
History repeats itself,

230
00:15:16,994 --> 00:15:19,303
but I never dreamed in a million years

231
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:21,747
I'd be bargaining for the notebook with you again.

232
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:29,601
MIHAEL KEEHL.

233
00:15:31,219 --> 00:15:32,480
Your real name.

234
00:15:32,622 --> 00:15:34,302
It's Mihael Keehl.

235
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:36,919
What the hell? How did he...

236
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,629
I did it.

237
00:15:38,756 --> 00:15:39,756
It's over, Mello.

238
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:41,261
It's time to turn yourself in.

239
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:43,272
If you give up, I won't kill you.

240
00:15:43,297 --> 00:15:44,816
You have my word on that.

241
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,746
What are you doing?

242
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:49,841
Don't be stupid. Write his name down and kill him! Now!

243
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:52,702
You know how this works.

244
00:15:52,727 --> 00:15:55,055
I write your name, and you will die.

245
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:57,866
Let go of that trigger and put your hands in the air.

246
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:07,376
Yagami...

247
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:08,300
Don't move!

248
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,727
I've written your first name, and it will
only take me a second to write your surname.

249
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:14,932
You idiot! Just write it!

250
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:16,010
Kill him!

251
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:17,565
I'm truly sorry.

252
00:16:18,138 --> 00:16:21,425
For what it's worth, I give you my
word that I never wanted to kill you.

253
00:16:22,987 --> 00:16:23,602
Hm?

254
00:16:27,157 --> 00:16:28,301
But tell me, Yagami,

255
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:31,945
you've never killed someone before, have you?

256
00:16:38,253 --> 00:16:39,143
Gunfire?

257
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,110
What was that?

258
00:16:48,913 --> 00:16:50,514
Jose! The notebook!

259
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:51,230
Damn!

260
00:16:52,305 --> 00:16:54,716
This guy he won't let go of the thing.

261
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:56,316
Son of a...

262
00:16:58,427 --> 00:16:58,992
Hm?

263
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:10,588
Deputy Director!

264
00:17:13,383 --> 00:17:14,780
It's all over, Mello!

265
00:17:15,106 --> 00:17:16,757
Put your hands up and surrender!

266
00:17:38,744 --> 00:17:40,606
Matsuda! Are you all right?

267
00:17:40,816 --> 00:17:42,830
No. I don't think so.

268
00:17:42,907 --> 00:17:44,282
I'm sure you'll live.

269
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:46,664
L, I don't see any sign of Mello.

270
00:17:50,493 --> 00:17:53,350
Dammit. After all that, he got away?

271
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,608
That's why you should have just killed him.

272
00:18:07,061 --> 00:18:08,951
Come on! Please, Dad!

273
00:18:08,979 --> 00:18:11,044
You can't die on me like this.

274
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:14,915
Light.

275
00:18:15,205 --> 00:18:16,175
Yeah, Dad?

276
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:22,696
Thank goodness.

277
00:18:25,328 --> 00:18:27,005
You'll be fine. It's OK.

278
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:30,194
Light.

279
00:18:31,683 --> 00:18:33,351
I still have them.

280
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,736
I still have the Shinigami eyes.

281
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:40,236
According to that Shinigami, Ryuk,

282
00:18:40,323 --> 00:18:44,579
I can't see the lifespan of someone who owns a notebook.

283
00:18:44,715 --> 00:18:47,862
But I can see the numbers above your head.

284
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:53,640
Light, you really aren't Kira.

285
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:58,428
I'm so glad, my son.

286
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:01,587
Don't tell me you're still worried about that, Chief.

287
00:19:01,612 --> 00:19:03,202
Of course he's not Kira.

288
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:04,781
Come on.

289
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:06,798
You shouldn't talk so much, Dad.

290
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:08,005
That's important,

291
00:19:08,057 --> 00:19:10,193
but I've got bigger things to deal with right now.

292
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:12,910
I've got to get him to write Mello's name in the notebook.

293
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:20,569
I... I'm so sorry, but in the end, I couldn't do it.

294
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,254
I couldn't bring myself to kill him.

295
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,408
I can't just come out and say, it's not too late.

296
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:28,755
No. Wait, maybe I can.

297
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,580
It all depends on how I do it.

298
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:33,508
No one will think it's weird if I get upset and panic.

299
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:35,359
Come on.

300
00:19:35,827 --> 00:19:37,056
Dad, write his name.

301
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:38,762
You can't let him beat you like this.

302
00:19:38,787 --> 00:19:40,084
Write his name down!

303
00:19:40,232 --> 00:19:41,799
With your last bit of strength.

304
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:43,732
Do you want to die in vain?

305
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:47,573
D... Dad, no!

306
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,217
Light...

307
00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:07,167
I'm sorry for your loss.

308
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:08,260
Dad.

309
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,984
Wake up!

310
00:20:10,594 --> 00:20:12,030
Come on, damn it!

311
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:14,760
Don't you die on me, you idiot!

312
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:17,180
Dad!

313
00:20:43,156 --> 00:20:46,754
You are the Shinigami who came here
to take back this notebook, aren't you?

314
00:20:48,036 --> 00:20:49,056
Yes.

315
00:20:49,638 --> 00:20:52,653
The notebook might be helpful to the Kira investigation,

316
00:20:52,847 --> 00:20:54,773
but we really only need one of them.

317
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,628
I'll give this one back to you.

318
00:21:05,246 --> 00:21:09,433
Humans who use the notebook are
cursed with fear, pain, and misery.

319
00:21:10,463 --> 00:21:13,325
Of course, Soichiro didn't use the notebook.

320
00:21:13,694 --> 00:21:17,009
He got to die believing that his son wasn't Kira.

321
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,216
I guess that means he was happy.

322
00:22:36,466 --> 00:22:39,127
If Kira gets caught, then he is evil.

323
00:22:39,152 --> 00:22:42,231
If Kira rules the world, then he is justice.

324
00:22:42,258 --> 00:22:46,152
From now on, the world will
start leaning in favor of Kira.
