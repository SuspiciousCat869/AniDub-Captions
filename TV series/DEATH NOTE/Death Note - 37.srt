1
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:44,506
How many seconds has it been
since you wrote down the first name?

2
00:01:46,954 --> 00:01:48,446
35.

3
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,948
36.

4
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:51,001
37.

5
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:52,551
38.

6
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,220
39.

7
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,145
Well, Near, look like I win.

8
00:01:57,247 --> 00:01:58,711
40.

9
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:23,735
We're still alive.

10
00:02:25,273 --> 00:02:28,109
It's been over a minute and we haven't died.

11
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:33,607
Didn't I already tell you all
that no one was going to die?

12
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:36,770
But... But... But why?

13
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:38,905
Why won't they die?

14
00:02:40,617 --> 00:02:44,140
God, I did everything you told me.

15
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,936
Rester, Gevanni, take him now.

16
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:54,787
Gevanni, the notebook please.

17
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:01,074
If you didn't believe me earlier, then see for yourselves.

18
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:08,789
I can confirm that the first four names are
definitely the real names of the SPK members.

19
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:11,186
The second four are the names of your team.

20
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,468
The only name that hasn't been written down

21
00:03:13,506 --> 00:03:14,725
is Light Yagami.

22
00:03:16,638 --> 00:03:20,071
If that weren't enough, Mikami also addressed you as God,

23
00:03:20,096 --> 00:03:21,955
and said he did what you asked him to.

24
00:03:23,182 --> 00:03:24,187
It's settled.

25
00:03:27,905 --> 00:03:28,983
It's a trap!

26
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,945
This whole thing is a set up!

27
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,664
This is all part of Near's plan to frame me.

28
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:37,836
Isn't it a little odd that no one died
after having their name written in the notebook?

29
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:39,560
This proves it's a trap.

30
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:48,546
I believe I already told you that no one
would die because I modified the notebook.

31
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:54,300
No, you... that... that can't be.

32
00:03:56,516 --> 00:03:57,790
This is a set up.

33
00:03:57,827 --> 00:03:59,308
I don't know this guy.

34
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:06,444
Light, it's too late to deny it.

35
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,081
You know Near has won.

36
00:04:08,238 --> 00:04:11,240
Just a moment ago, you were saying, "it looks like I win."

37
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:14,240
How much more of a confession do we need?

38
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:19,989
Light.

39
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:24,443
Why?

40
00:04:32,093 --> 00:04:33,165
Stop it.

41
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:44,940
Light Yagami.

42
00:04:45,716 --> 00:04:48,091
L. Kira.

43
00:04:49,482 --> 00:04:51,408
It's over. You've lost the game.

44
00:04:54,804 --> 00:04:59,183
Just a moment ago, you proclaimed
your victory, expecting us all to die.

45
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:02,482
And to tell the truth, you might have actually won,

46
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:04,544
and I would've lost.

47
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,461
We ended up doing exactly what you expected us to,

48
00:05:08,527 --> 00:05:11,505
and altered the fake notebook in Mikuni's possession.

49
00:05:13,672 --> 00:05:16,572
However, when I said before
that we had modified the notebook,

50
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:20,070
I was, in fact, referring to the
real notebook as well as the fake.

51
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,433
We only switched part of the fake notebook.

52
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:27,970
But as for the real one, we replaced the entire thing.

53
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,828
This notebook here is actually the real one.

54
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:32,716
No.

55
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:34,142
Impossible!

56
00:05:34,272 --> 00:05:38,193
We used the same kind of pen that Mikami
used, copied his handwriting perfectly,

57
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:42,155
and made both the inside and the outside
of our fake look exactly like the original.

58
00:05:42,882 --> 00:05:45,788
Gevanni was able to do it in a single night.

59
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:52,542
Of course, since I had touched
the real notebook before coming,

60
00:05:52,594 --> 00:05:54,925
I've been able to see the Shinigami as well.

61
00:05:57,237 --> 00:05:59,773
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Shinigami.

62
00:05:59,938 --> 00:06:00,845
I'm Near.

63
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:03,703
Nice to meet you too.

64
00:06:03,893 --> 00:06:05,291
My name is Ryuk.

65
00:06:05,593 --> 00:06:07,288
He can talk to Ryuk.

66
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:10,958
He can see him, so that means it.. it must be true.

67
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:14,273
Some of the edges of this notebook's pages are torn.

68
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:18,547
Tell me, if someone's name was written on a
ripped off piece of paper, would they still die?

69
00:06:18,794 --> 00:06:20,478
Oh yeah, of course they would.

70
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:21,726
I thought so.

71
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:24,515
I bet you were able to use that to your advantage.

72
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,494
I wonder how many times you deceived us with this,

73
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,477
and how many people you killed.

74
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,498
Light Yagami, you are Kira.

75
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,635
Thi... this has got to be a trick.

76
00:06:42,671 --> 00:06:44,947
Or could it be that Mikami's betrayed me somehow.

77
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:45,954
You're mistaken.

78
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:48,817
This was all thanks to Mello.

79
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:52,756
I believe if I explain this
much, you'll begin to understand.

80
00:06:53,104 --> 00:06:54,745
What? Mello?

81
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,308
Please take a look at this page of the notebook.

82
00:06:59,993 --> 00:07:02,018
Takada's name is in the notebook.

83
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:06,650
I was the one who killed her, but her
death was written there just one minute later.

84
00:07:07,737 --> 00:07:10,273
Did that mean Mikami did the same thing I did?

85
00:07:10,616 --> 00:07:13,919
God, you told me you couldn't move freely.

86
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:17,056
I had to make sure Takada was taken care of.

87
00:07:17,193 --> 00:07:18,851
Wasn't that my duty to you?

88
00:07:18,876 --> 00:07:19,835
You idiot!

89
00:07:19,904 --> 00:07:24,083
I gave you strict orders not to make
any unnecessary movements until today.

90
00:07:24,216 --> 00:07:25,327
It's all true.

91
00:07:25,564 --> 00:07:31,301
On the 26th, right after Takada's kidnapping
was broadcast on the news, Mikami went to the bank.

92
00:07:32,727 --> 00:07:33,924
I'd been trailing him.

93
00:07:34,627 --> 00:07:37,383
I knew he went to the bank every month on the 25th.

94
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:39,371
So it was bizarre

95
00:07:39,537 --> 00:07:43,510
for someone so methodical to
go to the bank twice in two days.

96
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:47,215
I followed Mikami to the bank as
he headed for the safe deposit boxes.

97
00:07:47,605 --> 00:07:52,165
It was only at this time that he seemed
concerned whether someone was following him or not.

98
00:07:53,193 --> 00:07:55,426
I got into his safe deposit box.

99
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:57,319
Inside was the real notebook.

100
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:01,324
Sure enough, Takada's name had
already been written inside it.

101
00:08:03,193 --> 00:08:05,360
Do you understand now, Light Yagami?

102
00:08:05,393 --> 00:08:09,614
You didn't realize that Mikami made a move on
his own and wrote Takada's name in his notebook,

103
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:12,964
because you had already killed her
using a notebook clipping yourself.

104
00:08:13,715 --> 00:08:17,459
This was the event that made me consider
the possibility of a fake notebook.

105
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:20,432
We were able to stop you thanks
to the efforts of one person

106
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:22,774
it was Mello who did it all.

107
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:27,904
Mello probably knew what was going to happen all along.

108
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:32,541
It can be resolved by having
a name written in the notebook?

109
00:08:32,738 --> 00:08:33,788
That's right.

110
00:08:36,154 --> 00:08:38,900
Well then, if I don't do it...

111
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:44,001
I bet Mello knew in his heart that working by ourselves,

112
00:08:44,026 --> 00:08:46,185
neither of us would be able to attain our goal

113
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,238
and surpass our mentor L.

114
00:08:49,353 --> 00:08:53,665
But together... together, we can stand with L.

115
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,938
Together, we can surpass L.

116
00:08:56,233 --> 00:09:00,127
And now, acting as one, we face the Kira who defeated L.

117
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:03,135
And with solid evidence, beat him at his own game.

118
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:08,115
Let's see you try and talk your way out of this one,

119
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:09,985
if you can.

120
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,548
That's right.

121
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,643
I am Kira.

122
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:04,887
That's right. I am Kira.

123
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,051
And what can you do?

124
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:11,969
Kill me right here?

125
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:15,677
Hear this.

126
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:20,816
I'm not only Kira, but I am also...

127
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,364
God of the New World.

128
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:28,589
Kira has become law in the world we now live.

129
00:10:28,614 --> 00:10:30,901
He's the one who's maintaining order.

130
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:36,559
I have become justice, the only hope for mankind.

131
00:10:37,628 --> 00:10:38,545
Kill me?

132
00:10:39,521 --> 00:10:41,946
Is that really the right thing to do?

133
00:10:44,654 --> 00:10:51,150
Since Kira's appearance six years ago, wars have stopped,
and global crime rates have been reduced by over 70%.

134
00:10:51,643 --> 00:10:53,262
But it's not enough.

135
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:58,035
This world is still rotten with too many rotten people.

136
00:11:00,854 --> 00:11:03,420
Somebody has to do this.

137
00:11:03,665 --> 00:11:06,732
And when I first got that notebook all those years ago,

138
00:11:06,757 --> 00:11:09,160
I knew I had to do it.

139
00:11:09,243 --> 00:11:09,916
No.

140
00:11:10,088 --> 00:11:12,362
I was the only one who could.

141
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:17,171
I understood that killing people was a crime.

142
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,544
There was no other way.

143
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:21,935
The world had to be fixed.

144
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,967
A purpose given to me.

145
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:27,851
Only I could do it.

146
00:11:29,465 --> 00:11:33,269
Who else could have done it and come this far?

147
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:35,112
Would they have kept going?

148
00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:38,358
The only one...

149
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,180
who can create a new world...

150
00:11:43,158 --> 00:11:44,358
is me.

151
00:11:50,754 --> 00:11:51,721
No.

152
00:11:51,821 --> 00:11:54,121
You're just a murderer, Light Yagami.

153
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:59,283
And this notebook is the deadliest weapon
of mass murder in the history of mankind.

154
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,967
You yielded to the power of
the Shinigami and the notebook.

155
00:12:04,154 --> 00:12:06,538
And you have confused yourself with a god.

156
00:12:06,888 --> 00:12:09,932
In the end, you're nothing
more than a crazy serial killer.

157
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:11,761
That's all you are.

158
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,681
Nothing more and nothing less.

159
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:33,433
Useless fools.

160
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,850
As if they could ever understand.

161
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:54,737
Near, here's some food for thought.

162
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:56,710
That notebook you have and the one that.

163
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,730
Aizawa brought from the Japanese task force headquarters

164
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,913
are they both real?

165
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,320
What is he up to?

166
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:05,453
Is he bluffing?

167
00:13:06,777 --> 00:13:10,150
At the moment, only I know where the real notebook is.

168
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:14,332
If you truly want to defeat Kira,

169
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,628
as well as test the notebook that Aizawa was carrying,

170
00:13:19,077 --> 00:13:23,266
I guess you're going to have to
write down either my name or Mikami's.

171
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,648
It's the only way to see if it's real,

172
00:13:32,504 --> 00:13:34,075
or fake.

173
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:36,612
He's hidden a piece of the notebook.

174
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:40,909
Matsuda.

175
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:47,574
Matsuda! You idiot!

176
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:51,297
Who the hell do you think you're shooting at?

177
00:13:51,676 --> 00:13:53,516
Don't screw with me!

178
00:13:55,343 --> 00:13:56,967
What was it all for then?

179
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:58,962
What about your dad?

180
00:13:58,987 --> 00:14:00,823
What the hell did he die for?

181
00:14:01,552 --> 00:14:02,571
My dad?

182
00:14:04,221 --> 00:14:06,011
You mean Soichiro Yagami?

183
00:14:06,476 --> 00:14:08,796
That's right, Matsuda, in this world,

184
00:14:08,821 --> 00:14:12,864
all those earnest people like him
who fight for justice they always lose.

185
00:14:12,943 --> 00:14:15,845
You want a world where people
like that are made to be fools?

186
00:14:16,109 --> 00:14:18,953
I know you understand, so kill the others.

187
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,009
Shoot them!

188
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:24,820
You led your own father to his death.

189
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:27,936
And now that he's gone, you call him a fool?

190
00:14:33,387 --> 00:14:34,288
His blood!

191
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:42,241
I'll kill him.

192
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,798
I'll kill him.

193
00:14:43,823 --> 00:14:45,020
He has to die!

194
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:45,942
Matsuda!

195
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:09,323
Damn you.

196
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,999
What the hell is this?

197
00:15:16,588 --> 00:15:19,686
Mikami, what are you waiting for?

198
00:15:20,932 --> 00:15:22,332
Write down their names!

199
00:15:22,677 --> 00:15:24,170
Write them down!

200
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:27,291
Kill them now!

201
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:33,905
It's finally over, isn't it, Near?

202
00:15:34,388 --> 00:15:35,371
Yes.

203
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:41,852
Where are you, Misa?

204
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:43,611
Where's Takada?

205
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:51,803
Someone.

206
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,725
What do I do now?

207
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,533
What the... Mikami!

208
00:16:16,888 --> 00:16:18,252
Quick, stop the bleeding.

209
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,877
It's already too late.

210
00:16:19,921 --> 00:16:22,040
He'll be dead in a few seconds.

211
00:16:37,426 --> 00:16:38,615
Wait, Light!

212
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,943
He's getting away.

213
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:42,468
Light!

214
00:16:42,493 --> 00:16:43,506
Mr. Aizawa.

215
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,751
It's unlikely he has anymore pieces of the notebook.

216
00:16:47,998 --> 00:16:50,939
And with those wounds, he's not going to go far.

217
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:53,839
He'll stop running soon, even if we leave him alone.

218
00:16:54,277 --> 00:16:54,856
Hmph.

219
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,632
Near, I'm not gonna follow your orders.

220
00:17:00,465 --> 00:17:01,765
Very well then.

221
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,325
I'll leave it up to you.

222
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:45,975
Well, Light, it looks like you've lost.

223
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:49,758
Remember how, in the beginning when we first met,

224
00:18:50,121 --> 00:18:53,922
I told you that I'd be the one
writing your name in my notebook.

225
00:18:57,143 --> 00:19:03,420
That is part of the agreement between a
Shinigami who brings a notebook to the human world

226
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:06,399
and the first human who picks it up.

227
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:13,535
If they put you in prison, who knows when you'd die.

228
00:19:14,132 --> 00:19:16,438
And I don't want to lie around waiting.

229
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:20,250
So it's all over.

230
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,274
You'll die here.

231
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:34,353
It was good while it lasted.

232
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:37,212
We eased each other's boredom for quite a while.

233
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,596
Well, Light, it's been interesting.
