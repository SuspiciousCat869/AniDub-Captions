1
00:01:32,088 --> 00:01:34,994
Light, there's another message from the second Kira.

2
00:01:35,027 --> 00:01:37,817
It was sent to Sakura TV and we intercepted it.

3
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,156
I'm told it's a video and a journal this time.

4
00:01:40,328 --> 00:01:42,480
Anyway, I figured I should tell you.

5
00:01:43,017 --> 00:01:43,986
A journal?

6
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:46,072
What is that idiot up to now?

7
00:01:46,145 --> 00:01:47,707
Why can't he just wait?

8
00:01:52,482 --> 00:01:54,559
He wanted the journal shown on TV?

9
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:56,096
Yes. This is it.

10
00:01:56,902 --> 00:01:57,643
Hmm.

11
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:00,467
2006?

12
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:02,679
These entries are from last year.

13
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:06,084
Please take a look at the entry he made on the 30th.

14
00:02:06,117 --> 00:02:06,970
Hmm.

15
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:09,945
"Confirmed our shinigami at the Tokyo Dome."

16
00:02:10,602 --> 00:02:14,493
This is probably supposed to mean
that he plans to do this on May 30th.

17
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:18,801
If this were aired on TV, his intentions
would be obvious to anyone who sees it.

18
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:24,250
Besides, he can't see my shinigami
unless he touches my Death Note.

19
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:26,010
How's he planning to do that?

20
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:32,731
Hey, Rem?

21
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:33,634
Hmm?

22
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,917
I forget.

23
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,150
Why can't I see my own lifespan
even though I have shinigami eyes?

24
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,830
Do you think you could tell me again?

25
00:02:40,883 --> 00:02:45,779
Humans with shinigami eyes only need
to know the lifespan of their victims.

26
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,784
And just as we can't see the
lifespan of others of our kind,

27
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:54,750
humans who possess a Death Note cannot see
each other's lifespan, even with the eyes.

28
00:02:54,784 --> 00:02:55,625
Hmm.

29
00:02:57,417 --> 00:02:58,717
May 22nd.

30
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,608
My friend and I showed off our notebooks in Aoyama.

31
00:03:01,693 --> 00:03:04,450
If by "notebooks" he's referring to our Death Notes,

32
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,046
that's something that could only be understood by me.

33
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:11,017
And as for the police, they'll be
distracted by the May 30th entry.

34
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:14,717
We confirmed our shinigami at
the baseball game in the Tokyo Dome.

35
00:03:15,053 --> 00:03:17,097
It must've been intended for them.

36
00:03:17,384 --> 00:03:19,884
I'm almost positive that the real message from this diary

37
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:21,950
is the one regarding Aoyama.

38
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,095
But if that's the case...

39
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:27,774
What do you think? Is it real?

40
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,672
I have to be careful not to say too much.

41
00:03:31,697 --> 00:03:34,340
Better to wait and hear his opinion, first.

42
00:03:34,912 --> 00:03:36,412
At this point in time,

43
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:38,751
all I can say for sure is, he must be stupid.

44
00:03:38,776 --> 00:03:40,007
Yeah, I agree.

45
00:03:40,162 --> 00:03:43,592
I mean it's completely obvious he
wants to meet Kira at the home game.

46
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:46,869
Doesn't he understand what would
happen if we aired this message?

47
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:50,375
It would create an immediate panic,
and the game would have to be canceled.

48
00:03:50,613 --> 00:03:52,867
To be honest, it's so stupid,

49
00:03:55,374 --> 00:03:58,887
I'm not even sure how to deal
with this whole situation anymore.

50
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:01,613
If we make the diary public,

51
00:04:01,638 --> 00:04:06,044
then we'll be forced to make some kind of
televised announcement canceling the game on the 30th.

52
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:10,342
But if we don't broadcast it, we can be
sure the second Kira won't do anything.

53
00:04:10,526 --> 00:04:12,558
Won't canceling the game make him angry?

54
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,100
There's no telling what he'll do.

55
00:04:14,131 --> 00:04:16,144
Frankly, that's not a big concern.

56
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:20,059
From what we've witnessed, it's safe to
say the second Kira admires the real one.

57
00:04:20,084 --> 00:04:24,042
He gave his word to the Kira we invented
that he'd refrain from killing aimlessly.

58
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,510
I'm inclined to believe that.

59
00:04:26,502 --> 00:04:28,498
I say we make it public,

60
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,847
and we air an announcement canceling the game.

61
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:33,625
At the same time we'll announce that, on May 30th,

62
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,893
we're going to set up checkpoints on
all roads leading to the Tokyo Dome.

63
00:04:37,869 --> 00:04:41,468
And finally, we'll send a response from our invented Kira.

64
00:04:41,493 --> 00:04:44,764
Something like, I understand,
and I agree to meet you there.

65
00:04:44,897 --> 00:04:48,035
Ryuzaki, you don't honestly expect him to go there

66
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,247
if we set up checkpoints around the dome, do you?

67
00:04:50,912 --> 00:04:53,112
I don't think that Kira would even consider it.

68
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,012
But it's possible the other one might.

69
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:59,049
It all depends on how stupid he really is.

70
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:03,168
However, assuming he's not actually the idiot we think is,

71
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:08,997
there could be another message hidden
in this diary, one that's not so obvious.

72
00:05:09,212 --> 00:05:11,945
If there's a message here written in some code

73
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,376
that only people who have this
shinigami power can understand,

74
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:17,840
there'd be no way for me to decipher it.

75
00:05:18,244 --> 00:05:22,973
Still, it would only make sense for us to look
into all the places that were mentioned in the journal.

76
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:26,361
Uh, 22nd, he's meeting a friend in Aoyama.

77
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:30,066
24th, meeting another friend in Shibuya.

78
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:34,258
We have to be prepared for the possibility
that all of our efforts will be fruitless.

79
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:37,491
Let's keep an eye out for people with notebooks in Aoyama

80
00:05:37,516 --> 00:05:39,796
and people in clothing stores in Shibuya.

81
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,275
It's as I thought.

82
00:05:42,326 --> 00:05:45,066
If this phony Kira slips up and gets apprehended,

83
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,650
at the very least I have to obtain his notebook.

84
00:05:47,683 --> 00:05:51,426
And in the worst case, I may end
up having to kill everyone there.

85
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:56,528
All we can do is place more
surveillance cameras in Aoyama and Shibuya

86
00:05:56,553 --> 00:05:58,305
in the hopes that we might capture somebody.

87
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,683
We should also arrange to have undercover
officers in both locations on these dates.

88
00:06:02,716 --> 00:06:07,149
I should probably go to Aoyama and Shibuya
since I blend in with the crowd there, ya know?

89
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:09,140
I'll go, too.

90
00:06:09,183 --> 00:06:10,383
But, Light

91
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:12,388
I'll be all right. Don't worry.

92
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,063
Aoyama and Shibuya are places I'd go anyway.

93
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:16,921
Not to mention, out of all of us,

94
00:06:16,993 --> 00:06:20,038
I'd probably look the most natural
hanging out with Matsui there.

95
00:06:20,216 --> 00:06:24,723
Besides, the second Kira will be there
looking for Kira, not for the police.

96
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:31,416
OK, we'll talk more about our trips tomorrow.

97
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:34,303
Sounds good, Light. See you tomorrow.

98
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:35,720
Careful getting home.

99
00:06:43,078 --> 00:06:43,871
Uh?

100
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:46,189
It never fails.

101
00:06:46,214 --> 00:06:48,414
The second I'm out the door, my phone starts ringing.

102
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,168
Yes?

103
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:50,749
It's Ryuzaki.

104
00:06:51,116 --> 00:06:52,516
When you two are working together,

105
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,183
I want you to keep a close eye on Light the entire time.

106
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:57,446
And please keep this between you and me.

107
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,247
Uh, sure.

108
00:06:59,483 --> 00:07:00,704
Yeah, I understand.

109
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:07,375
I guess he still plans to investigate Light
until the probability that he's Kira reaches zero.

110
00:07:09,398 --> 00:07:10,228
I'm home.

111
00:07:10,506 --> 00:07:13,158
Hello, dear. You're back quite late today.

112
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,064
Yeah.

113
00:07:14,363 --> 00:07:18,336
I'm supposed to keep the fact that I'm
helping with the Kira investigation a secret.

114
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:21,278
Uh, It's because I was hanging out my girlfriend.

115
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:22,411
Your?

116
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,038
What?

117
00:07:24,063 --> 00:07:25,579
Light, you have a girlfriend, now?

118
00:07:25,604 --> 00:07:26,355
What's her name?

119
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,513
It's not that surprising.

120
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:29,559
I'm 18 and I'm in university now.

121
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:31,199
Of course I have a girlfriend.

122
00:07:31,374 --> 00:07:33,656
You should look for a boyfriend, Sayu.

123
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,790
Huh? A boyfriend? What's that supposed to mean?

124
00:07:36,815 --> 00:07:38,894
Light, aren't you going to have any dinner?

125
00:07:39,078 --> 00:07:41,911
Actually, I'm still full from room service at the hotel.

126
00:07:42,631 --> 00:07:44,658
I can't believe you just said that to Mom.

127
00:07:44,683 --> 00:07:47,472
So what's this about a hotel? Sounds pretty suspicious.

128
00:07:49,078 --> 00:07:50,403
OK, Ryuk.

129
00:07:50,821 --> 00:07:52,265
We need to have a little talk.

130
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,214
Ah, should've known.

131
00:07:54,344 --> 00:07:57,121
And I'd appreciate an answer, if you could.

132
00:07:57,545 --> 00:08:00,356
If two shinigami happen to meet in the human world,

133
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,187
are they allowed to speak to each other?

134
00:08:02,212 --> 00:08:03,534
Hard to say.

135
00:08:03,745 --> 00:08:05,858
As long as I'm attached to a human,

136
00:08:05,883 --> 00:08:09,927
I'd say it's against the rules,
unless I had their permission, first.

137
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:12,778
But there's no laws against it either,

138
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:16,437
so I guess it's possible that
another shinigami might talk to me.

139
00:08:16,707 --> 00:08:20,261
So does that mean that if this
fake Kira's shinigami were to see you,

140
00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:24,071
there's a chance he might mention the fact
that you're with me and reveal that I'm Kira?

141
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:27,737
They probably wouldn't, but
it depends on their personality.

142
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:30,087
And if this kind of situation did arise,

143
00:08:30,112 --> 00:08:32,630
I can assume that you'll act the way you normally do?

144
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,661
Yeah.

145
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:36,745
Even if I see another human with a shinigami,

146
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,239
I'm not going to tell you.

147
00:08:38,516 --> 00:08:41,316
Well, I definitely think you've got the right approach.

148
00:08:41,441 --> 00:08:42,807
Meh. Thanks.

149
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:44,622
Huh?

150
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,193
There's no way.

151
00:08:46,263 --> 00:08:48,426
Did he really think this far ahead?

152
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,048
What is it?

153
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,375
Aoyama is a big area.

154
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,072
I was searching for possible meeting
places when I stumbled across this.

155
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:01,752
On the 22nd, there's a big event going on
at a club in Aoyama called the Note Blue.

156
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,483
"Aoyama" "blue mountain".

157
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:06,550
"Note" and "blue", it's a code.

158
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:09,846
Well, well. If you ask me, that's pretty elaborate.

159
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:12,238
He might be smarter than I thought.

160
00:09:12,783 --> 00:09:16,600
Which means I'll have to be
that much more careful from now on.

161
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:20,300
In any case, this Note Blue place
is definitely worth checking out.

162
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,016
What's the point in going there if you
don't want him to find out that you're Kira?

163
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,843
You really think it's worth the risk?

164
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,256
Uh, excuse me, Light?

165
00:09:36,788 --> 00:09:38,220
So what's going on here?

166
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:40,615
Oh. These are some of my friends from school.

167
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:43,383
Nice to meet you.

168
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:44,978
This is my cousin, Taro.

169
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,783
It's his first time ever in Tokyo,
and he wants to see Aoyama and Roppongi,

170
00:09:48,816 --> 00:09:51,398
so I figured the least we
could do is show him a good time.

171
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:52,883
I'm counting on you guys.

172
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:55,825
Oh, yeah. He also told me he's looking for a girlfriend,

173
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,888
so does anyone want to volunteer?

174
00:09:58,202 --> 00:10:00,049
Hey, I never said that.

175
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:03,370
I'm impressed, Light.

176
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:07,949
I doubt that anyone would ever suspect that there was
a police detective hanging around with these students.

177
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:15,482
With all of us walking together
like this, even if Ryuk is seen,

178
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,438
no one would be able to tell
which one of us he's following.

179
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:22,053
It's also a defense against L's surveillance cameras.

180
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:24,774
Not such a bad way to investigate, really.

181
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:26,547
I just have so stay relaxed

182
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:29,536
and keep an eye on the entrance
of the Note Blue when it opens.

183
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:38,532
Found you!

184
00:10:45,618 --> 00:10:47,652
Moon Yagami, is it?

185
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,309
You're the only one whose lifespan I can't see.

186
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:52,952
He's Kira.

187
00:10:53,156 --> 00:10:54,465
I can't believe it.

188
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:56,925
I never thought it would be this easy to find him.

189
00:11:02,984 --> 00:11:04,909
All right, Rem. Time to go.

190
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:05,687
Huh.

191
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:08,445
You finally found him and now you just want to leave?

192
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:10,289
Well, I can't go up to him and say,

193
00:11:10,314 --> 00:11:13,705
"Hi, Kira! Nice to meet you. I'm
the one who sent you the messages,"

194
00:11:13,734 --> 00:11:15,426
with all these people around.

195
00:11:15,504 --> 00:11:19,105
I know his name now, so I can
easily find out all about him.

196
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:21,937
After all, it's such a unique name.

197
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:39,664
Ohh, It's written as "Moon" but read as "Light."

198
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:41,184
Light Yagami.

199
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:44,191
He sure is amazing. Look at all this stuff.

200
00:11:44,478 --> 00:11:49,020
He won the national tennis championship when he
was in his second and third years of junior high.

201
00:11:49,169 --> 00:11:54,741
He gave an address as freshman representative at
this year's entrance ceremony at To-Oh University.

202
00:11:54,978 --> 00:11:59,525
I can't find a picture of him, but there won't
be anyone else with a name like Light Yagami.

203
00:11:59,898 --> 00:12:03,353
Who would've ever thought that
Kira would be so young and handsome?

204
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:06,053
Everything about him is better than I imagined.

205
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,064
I can't believe how easy it
was to purchase this information.

206
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:12,856
The world sure is a scary place.
I even know his home address now.

207
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,218
So we were there both days,

208
00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:19,635
in Aoyama on the 22nd and Shibuya on the 24th,

209
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,581
and we observed nothing of
significance on either occasion.

210
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:25,400
That leaves us with only the Dome on the 30th.

211
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:29,615
I didn't notice anyone who
looked suspicious at the Note Blue.

212
00:12:30,102 --> 00:12:32,047
Was he serious about the Dome?

213
00:12:33,793 --> 00:12:38,668
Ryuzaki, apparently Sakura TV has just
received another message from the second Kira.

214
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:42,471
It was postmarked on the 23rd.

215
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:46,431
I'm happy to say that I have found Kira.

216
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:49,733
To all the people at the television
station and the police department,

217
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:51,628
I'd like to thank you very much.

218
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:52,238
Huh?

219
00:12:52,392 --> 00:12:54,159
Im... Impossible!

220
00:12:54,336 --> 00:12:55,931
Where, in Aoyama?

221
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:58,044
His shinigami.

222
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,601
It must have seen Ryuk and picked me out of the crowd.

223
00:13:00,993 --> 00:13:01,691
No!

224
00:13:01,725 --> 00:13:04,573
No, there's no way he could've
known who Ryuk was attached to.

225
00:13:04,598 --> 00:13:07,219
I checked repeatedly that no one was following me.

226
00:13:07,998 --> 00:13:10,439
If this is true, the only possible event

227
00:13:10,464 --> 00:13:13,365
that would correspond with
this tape being mailed on the 23rd

228
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,827
is the entry regarding Aoyama on the 22nd.

229
00:13:16,474 --> 00:13:20,629
The only ones from the task force who
went to Aoyama are Matsuda and Light Yagami.

230
00:13:21,111 --> 00:13:23,587
Is Light really Kira after all?

231
00:13:23,817 --> 00:13:26,163
Still, there's no proof it even happened in Aoyama.

232
00:13:26,393 --> 00:13:28,360
This is a disaster if he found him.

233
00:13:28,385 --> 00:13:28,978
Yeah.

234
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:32,801
It most likely means that the two
Kiras are now cooperating with each other.

235
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:36,067
At this point, I don't think we
should jump to any conclusions.

236
00:13:36,092 --> 00:13:39,299
The second Kira is only saying
that he found him, nothing more.

237
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:41,554
He may not have made contact yet.

238
00:13:43,403 --> 00:13:45,071
Now that it's come to this...

239
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:51,140
we have no choice but to communicate as
the police directly with the second Kira.

240
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:53,025
You want to send a message?

241
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:54,197
Yes.

242
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,596
The police need to reach out to
the copycat and offer him a deal.

243
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,963
We need to negotiate with him to
see if we can get Kira's real name.

244
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,251
That's the last thing you wanted to hear, right?

245
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:08,225
This isn't good.

246
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,969
I have no idea how the fake Kira will react to this.

247
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,727
But I have no means of stopping
the police from sending this message.

248
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:17,371
If Kira doesn't yet know your name,

249
00:14:17,396 --> 00:14:20,338
it may not be too late for you,
provided you are willing to cooperate.

250
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:23,649
Whatever you do, you must not
approach Kira out of curiosity.

251
00:14:23,992 --> 00:14:27,292
Make no mistake Kira will kill you if you contact him.

252
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:29,515
You'll be used and disposed of.

253
00:14:29,955 --> 00:14:31,620
Consider your own life for a moment.

254
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,198
Yours, like every other life, has an intrinsic value.

255
00:14:34,478 --> 00:14:38,537
Now is your chance to right past wrongs
by sharing what you know about Kira.

256
00:14:38,683 --> 00:14:41,927
Only you can help us bring his reign of terror to an end.

257
00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:43,361
Hmm.

258
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,025
Where are you going?

259
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:48,841
To introduce myself.

260
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:52,648
So this is what you meant.

261
00:14:52,945 --> 00:14:55,066
Oh. Could that be your father?

262
00:14:55,091 --> 00:14:56,190
Coming!

263
00:14:57,969 --> 00:14:59,191
Welcome ho....

264
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:01,879
uh, hi.

265
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:03,692
Hello and good evening.

266
00:15:03,717 --> 00:15:05,515
My name is Misa Amane.

267
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:09,918
I just came by to give Light an important
notebook he left at school earlier today.

268
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:12,090
Could you wait here for a second?

269
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:14,735
Light!

270
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:17,431
Notebook?

271
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:18,734
Could it be?

272
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,287
Um, pleased to meet you.

273
00:15:34,374 --> 00:15:36,007
I'm Misa Amane.

274
00:15:36,355 --> 00:15:39,511
I thought you might get worried
if you saw that message on TV.

275
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:43,302
I just couldn't take it anymore,
so I brought this notebook.

276
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:46,336
A Death Note.

277
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:55,058
A shinigami.

278
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,880
She's the fake Kira.

279
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,553
Please, come in.

280
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,452
Are you sure it's OK?

281
00:16:02,622 --> 00:16:03,537
Thanks.

282
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:06,378
Mom, she came all this way to return my notebook.

283
00:16:06,403 --> 00:16:07,803
Could you make us some tea?

284
00:16:08,363 --> 00:16:10,241
Sure, I don't see why not.

285
00:16:10,783 --> 00:16:11,522
Hmm?

286
00:16:11,922 --> 00:16:13,417
I already told you about her.

287
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:20,229
Have a seat.

288
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:23,415
Oh. Um, thank you.

289
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,365
How did you find me?

290
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:37,526
I knew it.

291
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:40,140
You never made the shinigami eye deal.

292
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:42,950
When you have the shinigami eyes like I do,

293
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:46,103
you can see most people's name
and lifespan just by looking at them.

294
00:16:46,128 --> 00:16:50,162
However, you can't see the lifespan of
any person who possesses a Death Note.

295
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,428
No kidding.

296
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:56,795
I have to admit, even I wasn't
aware of that little detail.

297
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:59,604
Well, now you've managed to find me.

298
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,017
But you were careless.

299
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:02,609
What if you were caught by the police?

300
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:04,968
Then they'd know everything about Kira.

301
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:06,239
It's all right.

302
00:17:06,478 --> 00:17:08,445
Because the police didn't catch me,

303
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,170
and if I do as you say from now on,

304
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:11,603
they'll never be able to.

305
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:12,926
So we're safe.

306
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:15,965
After all, don't you need someone to see L's name?

307
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:18,796
If you want, I could be your eyes.

308
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:19,934
So

309
00:17:21,397 --> 00:17:22,104
Yeah?

310
00:17:22,896 --> 00:17:24,120
So what?

311
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:27,106
Would you please make me your girlfriend?

312
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:30,059
Girlfriend?

313
00:17:30,735 --> 00:17:31,601
Yes.

314
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:37,809
If she finds out I'm manipulating her
and gets hurt, she'll probably kill me.

315
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:38,775
But still...

316
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:40,321
Impossible.

317
00:17:40,374 --> 00:17:42,162
The day that you and I were in Aoyama,

318
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:45,305
there were three times the usual
number of surveillance cameras around.

319
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,726
Anyone who was in Aoyama on the 22nd would've
definitely been caught on camera that includes me.

320
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:53,883
If you and I were seen together,
it wouldn't look very good.

321
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:57,129
In fact, even being here together right now is a problem.

322
00:17:57,325 --> 00:17:58,985
I wish you'd understand that.

323
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,525
But look these are pictures of
me when I went to Aoyama that day.

324
00:18:05,926 --> 00:18:08,779
Well, I'm sure no one would recognize her from this.

325
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:10,692
And what about your fingerprints?

326
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:13,383
All those tapes you sent to the TV station.

327
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:15,789
They all had the same fingerprints on them.

328
00:18:15,831 --> 00:18:17,996
Yeah, but those aren't my fingerprints.

329
00:18:18,021 --> 00:18:21,062
It's not like I do these things
without thinking about them first.

330
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:23,746
Up until recently, I lived in the Kansai region,

331
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:26,267
and I had this friend who was into the occult.

332
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,486
I suggested that we distribute this fake poltergeist video

333
00:18:29,511 --> 00:18:31,881
I had made to a bunch of different TV shows,

334
00:18:31,926 --> 00:18:33,026
sort of as a prank.

335
00:18:33,051 --> 00:18:34,752
And she agreed to help me with it.

336
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:39,256
I had her take care of all of the dubbing
so my fingerprints wouldn't be on the tapes.

337
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:42,307
Then I took them from her added the Kira graphic

338
00:18:42,332 --> 00:18:44,726
and recorded the message with that voice effect.

339
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:48,257
And this friend you made the tapes with, where is she now?

340
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:49,648
Why are you doing this to me?

341
00:18:49,673 --> 00:18:52,130
If you want me to kill her, just say so and I'll kill her!

342
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:57,811
If you really still can't trust me, then here.

343
00:18:57,968 --> 00:19:00,006
I'll even let you hold onto my Death Note.

344
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:01,479
But you'd just be holding it.

345
00:19:01,626 --> 00:19:05,917
So I'd still be the rightful owner of it
and that means I get to keep my shinigami eyes.

346
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,128
Isn't that right, Rem?

347
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:09,779
Yes, that's right.

348
00:19:10,874 --> 00:19:13,745
Now there's no way I could possibly kill you.

349
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:17,505
And if I become a burden to
you, then you can just kill me, OK?

350
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,154
Why would she go this far?

351
00:19:21,216 --> 00:19:24,225
But you might have removed
several pages from your Death Note.

352
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,673
You could be hiding them somewhere for all I know.

353
00:19:27,593 --> 00:19:29,769
Why are you so suspicious of me?

354
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,357
I already told you, I don't
care even if all you do is use me.

355
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:34,750
Believe me.

356
00:19:35,893 --> 00:19:37,748
How can you say that?

357
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:43,536
Exactly one year ago, my parents were killed in a robbery.

358
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:46,652
I was home with them at the time.
It happened right in front of me.

359
00:19:47,025 --> 00:19:49,781
I wanted that man to pay for what he did.

360
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:51,942
But the trial dragged on forever.

361
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:55,124
Opinion started surfacing that
he was being falsely accused.

362
00:19:55,378 --> 00:19:56,624
Then it happened.

363
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:59,459
Kira punished him for what he did to my parents.

364
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,240
And that's why Kira means everything.

365
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,452
Kira means everything to me.

366
00:20:06,054 --> 00:20:10,205
All I... All I wanted was a chance to meet you one day,

367
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:12,567
so I could thank you for what you did.

368
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:20,839
So all these irrational moves, they
were just a means for her to meet Kira.

369
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:24,083
Still, she got around the surveillance cameras with ease

370
00:20:24,108 --> 00:20:26,811
and managed not to leave her fingerprints on the evidence.

371
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:28,759
She's not as stupid as I thought.

372
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,735
And she has promised to obey me from now on.

373
00:20:53,022 --> 00:20:54,168
I understand.

374
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:57,487
I can't be your boyfriend, but I can act like it.

375
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,616
The lengths you went to meet me, to be of help to me.

376
00:21:00,945 --> 00:21:04,334
Those eyes of yours that you
sacrificed half your life to get

377
00:21:04,492 --> 00:21:06,273
will become my weapon.

378
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:08,582
Thank you so much.

379
00:21:08,607 --> 00:21:11,957
I'll try my hardest to make you love me, I promise.

380
00:22:39,714 --> 00:22:42,788
That's good to know, Ryuzaki. I
also consider you a close friend.

381
00:22:42,813 --> 00:22:45,135
It'd be a shame if you no longer came to university.

382
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,166
I was looking forward to playing
tennis against you one last time.

383
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,406
L will die. That's all it took.
