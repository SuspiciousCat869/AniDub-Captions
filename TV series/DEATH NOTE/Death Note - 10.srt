1
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:41,089
I have to admit I was surprised, Ryuga.

2
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:44,640
I never thought you'd asked me to play
tennis as a way to get to know each other.

3
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:46,377
Is it a problem for you?

4
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,545
Not at all.

5
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:51,821
But when you first invited me to
play, did you know how good I was?

6
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:52,398
Yes.

7
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:53,559
I'll be fine, though.

8
00:01:53,973 --> 00:01:57,971
It's been a while, but at one time I
was actually the British junior champion.

9
00:01:58,254 --> 00:01:59,931
If I ask him if he's British,

10
00:01:59,983 --> 00:02:03,212
would he think I'm trying to find
out more about him because I'm Kira?

11
00:02:03,678 --> 00:02:05,781
Oh well, can't hurt to try.

12
00:02:06,144 --> 00:02:08,350
Ryuga, were you raised in the UK?

13
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,542
I lived in England for about
five years when I was younger,

14
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:12,581
but save your breath.

15
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,486
Nothing in that story would reveal L's true identity,

16
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,173
I promise you.

17
00:02:17,343 --> 00:02:19,314
Oh, is that so?

18
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,265
Well, since it's out first match,
why don't we just play a single set.

19
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,738
First one to six?

20
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:26,153
That's fine by me.

21
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,552
This is just a friendly game of tennis, nothing more.

22
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,238
In an of itself, it won't determine if Light is Kira.

23
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,250
But I know Kira hates to lose.

24
00:02:50,394 --> 00:02:51,594
15-love.

25
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:56,076
Woah, Ryuga. You sure don't mess around.

26
00:02:56,328 --> 00:02:57,933
He who strikes first wins.

27
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:01,197
What do you mean you're not at liberty to say?

28
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,653
I'm very sorry, sir.

29
00:03:03,663 --> 00:03:07,616
We're under orders from L not to discuss
the case with anyone, including you.

30
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,955
I'm not asking for details here,
just what you're doing and where.

31
00:03:11,137 --> 00:03:12,837
I'm very sorry, sir.

32
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:15,158
Hmm.

33
00:03:16,945 --> 00:03:19,333
You know, Yagami, it's been four months

34
00:03:19,358 --> 00:03:22,600
since this case came to the public's
attention, and they want results.

35
00:03:22,976 --> 00:03:25,531
People are saying that the NPA is incompetent,

36
00:03:25,556 --> 00:03:26,899
that L is incompetent.

37
00:03:26,924 --> 00:03:28,630
With all due respect, sir,

38
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:33,012
the rest of the department runs away with their
tails between their legs and we're incompetent?

39
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:37,169
Do you have any idea how many people are
left at task force headquarters these days?

40
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:40,652
If you're concerned with public opinion,
then you'll want to suppress the fact

41
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:45,205
that most of our detectives would rather let a
serial killer roam free than risk their lives.

42
00:03:46,753 --> 00:03:48,042
Please excuse me.

43
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:53,312
Yagami, what about this L character.

44
00:03:53,424 --> 00:03:54,923
Can he be trusted?

45
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,804
In my opinion, he's a lot more capable than we are.

46
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:03,721
Right now, even as we speak, he's risking his life.

47
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,851
Are these two really amateurs?

48
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:12,299
Who are they, anyway?

49
00:04:12,324 --> 00:04:15,058
I think their names are Light Yagami and Hideki Ryuga.

50
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,926
These are the same two guys
who scored perfect on the exam.

51
00:04:19,124 --> 00:04:22,312
Relax, Light. While it's true that Kira hates losing,

52
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:24,753
it's also true that most people
would rather win than lose.

53
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:25,968
It's human nature.

54
00:04:26,996 --> 00:04:29,662
Is he going to think that I'm Kira if I go for the win?

55
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,722
I suppose I could just lose on purpose.

56
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:33,519
But if I do, it could work against me.

57
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,576
Since he'd expect Kira to want to win,

58
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:38,820
he might also expect me to
throw the match to avoid suspicion.

59
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:42,959
I don't see any way that he can
profile me based on a tennis match.

60
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:46,858
So I have to assume he has some other goal in mind.

61
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:52,844
Either way, I'm not going to let him win.

62
00:04:57,138 --> 00:04:58,224
Look at that.

63
00:04:58,304 --> 00:05:00,062
He's going for the win.

64
00:05:00,304 --> 00:05:01,804
That's four games all.

65
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:03,388
Light Yagami to serve.

66
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:08,673
And just like that, we've got an umpire and a line judge.

67
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:11,009
You won't believe this.

68
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:14,025
I thought I'd heard the name Light
Yagami somewhere before, so I checked.

69
00:05:14,117 --> 00:05:16,822
He was the '02'03 junior high tennis champion.

70
00:05:17,114 --> 00:05:21,274
Apparently, during the third year awards ceremony,
he announced that he was hanging up his racket.

71
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,921
And I guess he hasn't played competitively since.

72
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,141
Hey, hey. What about my Ryuga.

73
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:30,763
Don't tell me you haven't noticed him holding
his own against this former junior high champ.

74
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:34,596
I can see the wheels turning, Light Yagami.

75
00:05:34,676 --> 00:05:36,348
I'm already in your head.

76
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:39,390
There's no way this tennis
match will deepen our friendship.

77
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:41,886
This is a token gesture, an elaborate act

78
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:44,619
we'll go through so we can say we're closer.

79
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,674
Because I wanted to play tennis with you,

80
00:05:46,738 --> 00:05:49,005
you'll assume that I'm preparing to take a step closer,

81
00:05:49,063 --> 00:05:51,233
laying the groundwork to get to know you better.

82
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:54,712
And then you're going to try and trap me

83
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:57,576
by getting me to say something that only Kira would know.

84
00:05:57,601 --> 00:06:01,170
However, I'm sure you'll tell me you
need to know if you can trust me first.

85
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:05,159
And of course, the only way to win your
trust will be to share what I know about Kira.

86
00:06:05,774 --> 00:06:07,799
If you want me to discuss Kira with you,

87
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:10,257
it only makes sense that I'd want to ask for proof

88
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:12,305
that you are in charge of the investigation

89
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,592
and, more importantly, that you
are really L, as you say you are.

90
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:19,551
So it goes without saying that the first
thing you're going to want from me is...

91
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:22,293
Some kind of confirmation

92
00:06:22,345 --> 00:06:25,060
from a third party that you really are L.

93
00:06:25,128 --> 00:06:26,562
Which means...

94
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,013
We'll have to go to task force headquarters.

95
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:32,816
In all things, one cannot win with defense alone.

96
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:35,366
To win, you must attack!

97
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,730
Game and set, won by Light Yagami!

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,619
Six games to four.

99
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,865
Just as I expected, you beat me.

100
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:53,577
It's been a while since I had to play that hard.

101
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:56,200
I'm feeling kind of thirsty,

102
00:06:56,237 --> 00:06:58,334
plus there's something I wanted to ask you about.

103
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:00,104
You want to go somewhere for drink?

104
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:02,255
You humored me with a tennis match.

105
00:07:02,314 --> 00:07:04,727
The least I can do is answer some of your questions.

106
00:07:05,255 --> 00:07:09,312
But before this conversation goes any
further, there's something I must tell you.

107
00:07:09,574 --> 00:07:10,590
What's that?

108
00:07:11,517 --> 00:07:15,227
I suspect that you, Light Yagami, are in fact Kira.

109
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:18,625
Now, if you still want to ask me
something, then please go ahead.

110
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:25,325
You think I'm Kira?

111
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,938
Well, when I say I suspect
you, it's only a 1% possibility.

112
00:07:29,393 --> 00:07:32,809
But that aside, I don't mind telling
you that once I'm sure you aren't Kira

113
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:36,457
and I can verify that your deductive
skills are as strong as I think they are,

114
00:07:36,595 --> 00:07:39,984
I'd like nothing more than to have
you work with me on this investigation.

115
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,877
1%, huh?

116
00:07:45,102 --> 00:07:46,556
That was well worded

117
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:49,566
because no matter how little he says he suspects me,

118
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:53,470
it means he has grounds to prevent me
from meeting anyone on the task force.

119
00:07:53,798 --> 00:07:56,331
It's quite the preemptive move on his part.

120
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:57,807
He got me.

121
00:08:01,202 --> 00:08:03,735
This coffee shop is one of my favorites in the area.

122
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,342
And if we sit here, there's no
chance of anyone overhearing us.

123
00:08:07,712 --> 00:08:09,325
Thanks for showing me this place.

124
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,613
I can see why you like it.

125
00:08:10,754 --> 00:08:12,588
Not to mention we're so out of the way here,

126
00:08:12,613 --> 00:08:14,945
no one's going to give you a
hard time about the way you sit.

127
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:18,762
I don't sit like this because I
want to. I have to sit like this.

128
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:23,699
You see, if I were to sit normally, my deductive
skills would immediately be reduced by roughly 40%.

129
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:26,971
So what was it you wanted to ask me?

130
00:08:27,117 --> 00:08:27,889
Right.

131
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:31,297
I'm sure that can wait until
you're convinced that I'm not Kira.

132
00:08:31,322 --> 00:08:33,833
So please, let's talk about whatever you want to.

133
00:08:34,627 --> 00:08:36,450
You're under no obligation to do this,

134
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:40,412
but would you mind submitting yourself to
a test of your deductive reasoning skills?

135
00:08:40,878 --> 00:08:42,253
Sure, why not?

136
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,595
Sounds like fun.

137
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,090
All right, then.

138
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:47,348
We can begin by taking a look at these.

139
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:52,655
Photographs of three notes written by prison inmates

140
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,480
while under Kira's control just prior to their deaths.

141
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:57,742
None of this information has been made public.

142
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,460
You can take as long as you want to look them over.

143
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:02,274
Please let me know what you think.

144
00:09:03,957 --> 00:09:05,346
Very interesting.

145
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:07,911
Come on, this is child's plays.

146
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:10,847
There's a print number on the
back of each of these photographs.

147
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:15,223
If I ignore this fact and was
still able to come up with the phrase,

148
00:09:15,295 --> 00:09:17,891
"L do you know gods of death love apples?"

149
00:09:18,111 --> 00:09:19,107
what would that mean?

150
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,803
Clearly, if I read it the way
Kira intended on my first attempt,

151
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:24,570
I'd only look more suspicious.

152
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:29,311
But the fact that I'm able to solve this silly
code isn't enough on its own to prove that I'm Kira.

153
00:09:30,716 --> 00:09:34,224
It would be quite amazing to learn
that not only could Kira kill others

154
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:36,628
but could also control his victim's actions.

155
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,874
I think Kira wrote these, and it
seems he's encoded a message for you,

156
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,718
as well, almost as if he's mocking you.

157
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,736
If you line these notes up sidebyside and
take a look at the first letter of every line,

158
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,005
it reveals a message.

159
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:51,184
Rearranging it like this gives you,

160
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:55,849
"L, do you know gods of death love apples."

161
00:09:57,566 --> 00:10:00,823
But there are obvious print numbers
on the back of all these photographs.

162
00:10:01,037 --> 00:10:03,285
Arrange it in that order, we get,

163
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:07,788
"L, do you know love apples gods of death."

164
00:10:08,987 --> 00:10:10,424
That doesn't sound right.

165
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:12,364
And based on that, it's hard to believe that

166
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:14,428
Kira would have wanted you to read it this way.

167
00:10:14,555 --> 00:10:15,861
That's incorrect.

168
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:16,844
Huh?

169
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:20,469
The thing is, there are actually four photographs.

170
00:10:20,674 --> 00:10:22,791
When we add this one, it reads,

171
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:25,494
"L, do you know

172
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:28,639
gods of death who love apples have red hands."

173
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:30,562
It's a fake.

174
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:33,717
I never made any criminal write
the letter in this fourth picture.

175
00:10:33,893 --> 00:10:35,337
Is he stupid?

176
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,889
But seeing as I only had three photographs
to work with, my deduction was perfect.

177
00:10:39,914 --> 00:10:41,214
No, it wasn't.

178
00:10:41,337 --> 00:10:43,615
The truth is there were four of them.

179
00:10:43,662 --> 00:10:46,296
If you'd figured that out, it would've been perfect.

180
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:51,968
Even though you knew the message was incomplete,
you decided that there were only three notes.

181
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:54,760
You never even considered that there might be a fourth.

182
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:56,083
What do you make of that?

183
00:10:56,654 --> 00:10:57,608
Damn him.

184
00:10:57,633 --> 00:11:00,722
This wasn't just about gauging
my deductive reasoning skills.

185
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:02,676
He wanted to see what my reaction would be.

186
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:04,237
If I keep falling for his tricks,

187
00:11:04,274 --> 00:11:06,366
I'll be playing right into his hands.

188
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:07,952
Hmm.

189
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,571
Well, you got me there. I didn't think of that.

190
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:15,002
In any case, the likelihood this message
will lead you to Kira is not very great.

191
00:11:15,027 --> 00:11:17,347
Besides, we all know gods of death don't exist.

192
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:20,262
If you were me, faced with someone who might be Kira,

193
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:23,744
how would you go about establishing
this person's innocence or guilt?

194
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:25,538
You need to be absolutely sure.

195
00:11:26,064 --> 00:11:29,660
I would probably try to get them to say
something that was never made public in any way,

196
00:11:29,685 --> 00:11:31,620
something that only Kira could know.

197
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,375
Kind of like what you were doing just now.

198
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,470
Truly amazing.

199
00:11:36,774 --> 00:11:40,722
What's incredible is that I've asked
countless detectives that same question,

200
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:43,459
and it took most of them minutes
to even come up with an answer.

201
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,432
But you?

202
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:50,630
You immediately thought of a scenario in which
Kira is speaking directly to the investigator.

203
00:11:50,864 --> 00:11:52,065
I'm impressed.

204
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:54,271
You'll make a fine detective, Light.

205
00:11:56,036 --> 00:11:58,036
But it's a bit of a doubleedged sword.

206
00:11:58,061 --> 00:12:01,128
The more impressive my answers,
the more of a suspect I become.

207
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:03,329
Yes. It's about 3% now.

208
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:09,382
However, it's made me that much more
determined to work with you on this investigation.

209
00:12:10,084 --> 00:12:13,227
You see, I'm in a position where even if you are Kira,

210
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:16,996
it would still be to my benefit
to have you working alongside us.

211
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:18,509
Do you know why I'd say that?

212
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:24,050
If I cooperate with you, there's a chance I
can help the investigation to move forward.

213
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,846
And if I'm Kira, I might reveal myself.

214
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,801
In other words, whether I'm Kira
or not, you stand to gain either way.

215
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:33,371
It's a very smart move on your part.

216
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:35,828
But I think you might be getting the wrong idea.

217
00:12:35,873 --> 00:12:38,273
It's true that I do have an interest in the Kira case.

218
00:12:38,298 --> 00:12:40,731
And yes, detective work is a hobby of mine.

219
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,273
But I know that I'm not Kira.

220
00:12:43,298 --> 00:12:45,298
And I certainly don't want to be killed by him.

221
00:12:45,323 --> 00:12:49,231
Besides, what proof have you been able
to give me that you yourself aren't Kira?

222
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:53,646
I mean, it hardly seems fair for just one
of us to be investigated, wouldn't you say?

223
00:12:53,755 --> 00:12:56,499
At this point, neither of us
can prove that we're not Kira.

224
00:12:57,098 --> 00:12:58,888
However, if you are in fact L,

225
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:01,481
I don't imagine it would be that
hard for you to prove it to me.

226
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:04,227
I think I'd be convinced if, say, my father or

227
00:13:04,252 --> 00:13:07,966
someone else from the task force
headquarters was able to confirm your identity.

228
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,922
If you can't do that, then I'm
afraid I just won't be able to help you.

229
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,666
You sure talk a lot, don't you Light?

230
00:13:15,768 --> 00:13:17,871
Typical for someone who hates losing.

231
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:20,058
We've got 7%.

232
00:13:20,245 --> 00:13:21,833
Could it really be him?

233
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:28,072
I don't remember saying you couldn't meet anyone
from task force headquarters to verify my identity.

234
00:13:28,983 --> 00:13:34,515
I'm currently working alongside your father, as
well as several other senior detectives from the NPA.

235
00:13:34,978 --> 00:13:38,747
Now, if I understand you correctly and
I take you to task force headquarters,

236
00:13:38,772 --> 00:13:40,834
you'll help us with the investigation.

237
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,209
Am I safe in making this assumption?

238
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,755
Does this guy have a death wish?

239
00:13:45,922 --> 00:13:47,694
I don't understand. What's he thinking?

240
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:50,555
Excuse me.

241
00:13:51,502 --> 00:13:53,067
Oh, there goes mine.

242
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:54,929
Yes?

243
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:57,584
Ryuzaki I have some bad news.

244
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,774
Light, your father is...

245
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,721
Light, it's your.

246
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,160
My father!

247
00:14:03,307 --> 00:14:05,167
He had a heart attack!

248
00:14:18,203 --> 00:14:19,630
OK, see you tomorrow.

249
00:14:19,655 --> 00:14:22,192
Have them call home if you need me to bring anything.

250
00:14:22,217 --> 00:14:24,206
Light? You take care of him, OK?

251
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:24,666
Sure.

252
00:14:30,187 --> 00:14:32,969
So the doctors think stress was the only cause?

253
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:34,009
Yeah.

254
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:36,910
To be honest, I thought it
was Kira when I first collapsed.

255
00:14:36,935 --> 00:14:38,068
But I'll be all right.

256
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:41,156
It seems I've been pushing myself a bit too hard lately.

257
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,201
Indeed.

258
00:14:42,226 --> 00:14:45,839
It must have added to your stress knowing
that Light is a suspect in this investigation.

259
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:47,832
You actually told my father that?

260
00:14:47,857 --> 00:14:48,620
Yes.

261
00:14:48,782 --> 00:14:50,715
In fact, I've told him everything.

262
00:14:51,097 --> 00:14:53,492
It's true. He even knows that I am L.

263
00:14:55,573 --> 00:14:56,928
That's correct.

264
00:14:57,046 --> 00:14:58,380
This man is L.

265
00:14:58,475 --> 00:15:02,630
To protect his identity, we on the
task force refer to him as Ryuzaki.

266
00:15:02,823 --> 00:15:04,766
But make no mistake. It's him.

267
00:15:05,346 --> 00:15:07,179
This guy is the real L.

268
00:15:07,277 --> 00:15:08,749
My father wouldn't lie.

269
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:12,173
The very same man who's been
controlling the police up to this point.

270
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:15,331
If I get rid of him and the
rest of the investigative team...

271
00:15:15,585 --> 00:15:19,196
No... No, let's face it. It wouldn't be that simple.

272
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,303
There's no need to rush.

273
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,429
I have time to sit back and watch.

274
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:27,822
But for now, I'm the Light
Yagami who's worried for his father.

275
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:34,144
So, Ryuzaki, now that you've had the chance
to talk to my son, is he cleared as a suspect?

276
00:15:34,482 --> 00:15:37,815
When I say I suspect him, you should know it's very minor.

277
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:40,204
We've gone over this, but I'll explain it again.

278
00:15:40,285 --> 00:15:44,915
Not long ago, Kira killed 12 FBI
agents who'd come to Japan to assist us.

279
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:49,762
They were instructed to follow
people connected to the Japanese police.

280
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,528
One of these agents, Raye Penber,

281
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:55,005
exhibited unusual behavior before he died.

282
00:15:56,311 --> 00:16:01,133
I understand, and I was one of the people
Raye Penber was investigating before he died.

283
00:16:01,387 --> 00:16:03,561
It only makes sense I'd be a suspect.

284
00:16:03,783 --> 00:16:04,425
Nope.

285
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,212
To be more precise, there's no one else you could suspect.

286
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:10,995
I find Light's deductive powers quite impressive.

287
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:13,664
He's always quick and to the point.

288
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,498
Ryuga, I'd like to help with the investigation.

289
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:20,328
My father has erased any doubts I
might have regarding your true identity.

290
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:25,633
Also, I'd like nothing more than to catch Kira
so I can prove once and for all that I'm not him.

291
00:16:25,814 --> 00:16:27,080
No, Light.

292
00:16:27,616 --> 00:16:31,837
This is a time in your life when you
should be studying to become a police officer.

293
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:34,410
It won't be to late to join us once you are done.

294
00:16:34,562 --> 00:16:36,424
Come on, Dad, what are you talking about?

295
00:16:36,464 --> 00:16:38,400
Who knows how many years that'll take.

296
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:41,347
Besides, don't you remember my promise?

297
00:16:41,858 --> 00:16:43,873
That if something ever happened to you,

298
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:47,696
I would find Kira and make sure he gets executed.

299
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:53,308
I refuse to believe that my son could turn out to be Kira.

300
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,916
This doesn't seem like an act to me.

301
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,469
Or if it is, it's too cheesy.

302
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:01,464
Light, listen to me.

303
00:17:02,136 --> 00:17:03,937
Kira is pure evil.

304
00:17:04,103 --> 00:17:05,789
We can all agree on that.

305
00:17:05,994 --> 00:17:10,187
But recently, I've started thinking of
this whole situation in a different way.

306
00:17:10,836 --> 00:17:14,055
What is truly evil is the power to kill people.

307
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:18,745
And any person who has come to
possess this kind of power is cursed.

308
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,657
No matter how you use it,

309
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:23,974
no true happiness can be obtained like that,

310
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,130
not by killing other people.

311
00:17:27,282 --> 00:17:28,884
I think you're absolutely right.

312
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,238
If Kira is just a normal person

313
00:17:32,263 --> 00:17:34,422
who somehow obtained this awful power,

314
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:36,572
I would say that he's cursed.

315
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:39,824
Ryuzaki, I'm sorry for all this trouble.

316
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:42,778
But I'll be back at work as soon
as the doctors let me out of here.

317
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:46,935
Excuse me, visiting hours were over 10 minutes ago.

318
00:17:54,295 --> 00:17:58,232
Ryuga, what would it take to get
you to believe that I'm not Kira.

319
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:00,099
Please, isn't there something?

320
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:02,668
If you aren't Kira, it won't be necessary.

321
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:05,139
Let things run their course
and the truth will be revealed.

322
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:06,941
I can't take this anymore!

323
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:08,340
Put yourself in my position.

324
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:10,972
How do you think it feels to be accused of being Kira?

325
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:15,529
It was one of the worst feelings ever.

326
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:18,814
What if you were to lock me up
for a month in a place with no TV

327
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:22,755
or any other kind of access to the outside
world and keep a constant watch over me?

328
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:27,831
Would any normal person be willing to go
to such extreme measures to clear their name?

329
00:18:28,093 --> 00:18:29,095
That's no good.

330
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:32,408
I can't do anything that would
deprive you of basic human rights.

331
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,680
And furthermore, it is complete
nonsense for the investigator

332
00:18:35,705 --> 00:18:37,885
to take suggestions from the suspect.

333
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:39,227
I understand.

334
00:18:40,164 --> 00:18:42,230
Don't worry so much.

335
00:18:42,445 --> 00:18:43,078
Be patient.

336
00:18:43,103 --> 00:18:45,355
It'll become apparent to us if you're not Kira.

337
00:18:45,807 --> 00:18:48,940
And listening to that conversation
between you and your father,

338
00:18:49,118 --> 00:18:51,718
I was almost convinced you might not be him.

339
00:18:52,155 --> 00:18:54,922
Light, please take good care of Mr. Yagami.

340
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:56,307
Oh, one more thing.

341
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,754
I know I agreed to help with the investigation.

342
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:02,239
But I don't think I'll be able to do
much until my father's healthy again.

343
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:04,045
Yes, of course.

344
00:19:04,587 --> 00:19:05,425
Well, then.

345
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:10,759
Hideki Ryuga.

346
00:19:11,364 --> 00:19:12,956
Ryuzaki.

347
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,744
He's the L I've been fighting this whole time.

348
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:18,574
What is his real name?

349
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,433
Light Yagami.

350
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,899
Are you not Kira?

351
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,495
Ryuk.

352
00:19:26,937 --> 00:19:27,606
Huh?

353
00:19:28,121 --> 00:19:30,988
I never once felt cursed since I picked up the death note.

354
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:33,660
In fact, the thought never even crossed my mind.

355
00:19:34,522 --> 00:19:38,235
I'm happier than I've ever been, all thanks to this power.

356
00:19:38,857 --> 00:19:41,535
I'm going to create a perfect world.

357
00:19:41,902 --> 00:19:46,497
Honestly, I could care less whether you
feel cursed or happy to have a notebook.

358
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:50,003
I'll leave that sentimental crap to you humans.

359
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:56,312
But normally, humans who come into contact
with the Shinigami have nothing but misfortune.

360
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:01,277
That's interesting.

361
00:20:01,402 --> 00:20:05,267
But I have no intentions of repeating that pattern.

362
00:20:05,554 --> 00:20:07,522
Well, I hope you're right about that.

363
00:20:09,178 --> 00:20:10,588
What is this crap?

364
00:20:10,663 --> 00:20:13,225
Don't tell me this is your idea of a proposal.

365
00:20:13,343 --> 00:20:15,159
Listen, you people must think

366
00:20:15,184 --> 00:20:18,760
that just mentioning Kira's name is
enough to get us the ratings we need, huh?

367
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:19,882
Well, you're wrong.

368
00:20:19,907 --> 00:20:23,998
Our program gets the ratings because we cover
the stories that the other stations won't touch.

369
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,423
If it bleeds, it leads.

370
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:29,882
What I need is a good freaking story, not this crap.

371
00:20:29,907 --> 00:20:32,053
Now get out there and fine me a story.

372
00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:33,909
But the police won't talk, sir.

373
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,357
It's been impossible to get details from them lately.

374
00:20:36,412 --> 00:20:38,636
Idiot! I don't pay you to complain.

375
00:20:38,661 --> 00:20:41,334
If they won't give you anything, then get creative!

376
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,257
Huh?

377
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:45,063
Mr. Demegawa, sir?

378
00:20:45,265 --> 00:20:46,386
This is for you.

379
00:20:47,265 --> 00:20:48,364
What is it?

380
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,081
So who is this from?

381
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:52,268
Huh?

382
00:20:56,637 --> 00:20:58,694
Now this is more like it.

383
00:20:58,936 --> 00:21:01,503
This is what I call a story.

384
00:21:01,648 --> 00:21:04,704
It's almost too good to be true.

385
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,230
A message to the world from Kira

386
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:09,322
"if you do not broadcast these tapes,

387
00:21:09,347 --> 00:21:13,181
I will kill your company's board of directors one by one."

388
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:15,095
Who wouldn't air these?

389
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:18,483
If this is for real, our ratings
are going to go through the roof.

390
00:21:18,655 --> 00:21:19,651
Holy crap!

391
00:21:19,716 --> 00:21:23,053
I'm so excited I feel like I'm having a heart attack here!

392
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:38,741
If I just leave things as they are,

393
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:42,079
I'm pretty sure that L will be
finished off within the next four days.

394
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:44,646
It looks like I've even got God on my side now.

395
00:22:44,688 --> 00:22:48,845
I suppose it's actually a god of death, a Shinigami.
