1
00:01:28,778 --> 00:01:31,828
I feel you're the first friend that I have ever had.

2
00:01:32,012 --> 00:01:33,906
Whoa.

3
00:01:36,637 --> 00:01:37,208
Misa?

4
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:37,990
Yes?

5
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:41,370
Then could you ask Rem to kill L?

6
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,286
Huh?

7
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:45,645
Rem, I want Light to love me.

8
00:01:45,737 --> 00:01:48,178
And I know we could be happy together.

9
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,460
It's all I ever wanted.

10
00:01:50,762 --> 00:01:52,028
That's fine.

11
00:01:52,137 --> 00:01:54,426
I'll kill L for you.

12
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,607
L will die.

13
00:01:57,512 --> 00:01:59,593
That's all it took.

14
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:05,572
So when should I kill him?

15
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:09,976
If you take them to where he
is, I can kill him immediately.

16
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:11,797
The sooner the better.

17
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,124
Maybe tomorrow.

18
00:02:13,253 --> 00:02:13,836
Hm.

19
00:02:13,944 --> 00:02:16,884
I should think this through before we do anything.

20
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:20,391
I need tonight to decide how we're going to kill L.

21
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,903
And I'll give you my answer tomorrow.

22
00:02:22,195 --> 00:02:23,122
Very well.

23
00:02:23,495 --> 00:02:28,174
Also, no matter what, you can't
kill him until I give the order.

24
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:30,028
No matter what. Understood?

25
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:31,251
All right.

26
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:35,362
I'll promise you that, at least where L is concerned.

27
00:02:35,745 --> 00:02:38,845
Misa, I need you to give me your cell phone number.

28
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,211
About time. What took you so long?

29
00:02:41,236 --> 00:02:42,632
Give me yours too, OK?

30
00:02:42,678 --> 00:02:45,068
No, Misa. I'm afraid I can't do that.

31
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:46,349
Why not?

32
00:02:46,426 --> 00:02:48,613
I'm your girlfriend. I should have your number.

33
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,169
I already told you, I'm under surveillance by the police.

34
00:02:52,194 --> 00:02:56,582
Keep in mind, it's not difficult for
them to bug even cellphones these days.

35
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,672
Oh, OK. Then what about this?

36
00:02:59,697 --> 00:03:01,507
I'll just give you one of my phones.

37
00:03:01,578 --> 00:03:04,932
I ended up with three of them,
'cause I use them for different things.

38
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:07,557
Yeah, good idea.

39
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:09,865
If we use yours, I think we'll be safe.

40
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:10,915
That's great!

41
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:14,069
I can hear your voice everyday, and text you, too.

42
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,998
No, I'll keep this one turned off.

43
00:03:16,023 --> 00:03:20,502
I'll be the only one making the calls,
and only when it's absolutely necessary.

44
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:21,478
What?

45
00:03:21,736 --> 00:03:22,998
No way.

46
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,371
Then when are you gonna call me?

47
00:03:25,528 --> 00:03:26,895
Probably tomorrow.

48
00:03:26,961 --> 00:03:27,465
Oh.

49
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,756
That will most likely be the day we
execute L, but I'll call you either way.

50
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,386
What? Tomorrow?

51
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:35,150
It doesn't sound like a very romantic call,

52
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:37,848
but I suppose we can always talk about us afterwards.

53
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:40,540
Well, I think you should probably go home now, Misa.

54
00:03:40,565 --> 00:03:43,127
Huh? But why? It's only 7 o'clock.

55
00:03:43,152 --> 00:03:45,652
The time for lovers is just beginning, you know?

56
00:03:45,677 --> 00:03:48,877
We can go for a romantic dinner, then
maybe a moonlight stroll in the park.

57
00:03:48,902 --> 00:03:50,773
And after that, the main event!

58
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:51,433
Misa.

59
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:51,908
Huh?

60
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,450
Wow.

61
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,309
Listen, you have to go home now.

62
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:07,903
OK.

63
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:10,923
Also, when you're talking to Rem outside,

64
00:04:10,988 --> 00:04:13,334
be careful that no one's around to listen.

65
00:04:13,364 --> 00:04:14,626
Just whisper.

66
00:04:14,728 --> 00:04:16,888
That's what I always do with Ryuk.

67
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:18,130
OK.

68
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,216
Byebye. Have a good night.

69
00:04:20,241 --> 00:04:21,551
Byebye, Misa!

70
00:04:21,576 --> 00:04:23,515
Come again real soon!

71
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,666
That kiss came out of nowhere.

72
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:33,607
Sure. It's very important that
Misa stays infatuated with me.

73
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:34,455
Oh.

74
00:04:34,595 --> 00:04:38,095
More importantly, I need to
decide if L should die tomorrow.

75
00:04:38,462 --> 00:04:41,420
Since he hasn't gone public yet, if Ryuga dies,

76
00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:44,443
the other task force members will be suspicious of me.

77
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:46,568
So I have to make sure I'm prepared.

78
00:04:46,593 --> 00:04:47,561
I see.

79
00:04:47,962 --> 00:04:50,275
I thought perhaps you were hesitating

80
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:53,059
because he said he thinks of you as a friend.

81
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:54,534
A friend?

82
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,355
I just gave him what he wanted.

83
00:04:56,445 --> 00:05:01,558
From the start, I've said if it's my friendship he
wants, I'd give it to him as a way to win his trust.

84
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:04,826
Ryuga and Light Yagami appear to be friends.

85
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:06,868
But L is Kira's enemy.

86
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:16,715
That's right.

87
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:21,136
Ryuga revealed that he is L. Therefore, he must die.

88
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,811
If I have him die in an accident,

89
00:05:24,936 --> 00:05:28,107
chances are that less people will suspect I'm Kira.

90
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:31,103
And even if they do, there'd be no proof.

91
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:34,540
I can only speculate what will happen after he dies.

92
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:41,582
Tomorrow will be L's, or at least
Ryuga and Ryuzaki's, last day alive.

93
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:52,459
Hair.

94
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,032
Hm.

95
00:05:56,162 --> 00:05:58,284
Snack crumbs.

96
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,028
Hm.

97
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:01,253
Hair.

98
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:04,055
Mr. Yagami?

99
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,622
Huh?

100
00:06:05,628 --> 00:06:09,271
If I die within the next few days, your son is Kira.

101
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:11,207
Hm, another hair.

102
00:06:13,494 --> 00:06:15,442
What did you just say, Ryuzaki?

103
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:16,486
Exactly.

104
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,180
What are you talking about, anyway?

105
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:21,597
If anything happens to me, I've asked
Watari to make himself available to you.

106
00:06:21,622 --> 00:06:23,359
So I'm counting on the team.

107
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:27,046
Ryuzaki, you said he was almost cleared, and now this?

108
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:29,811
Honestly, how much do you suspect my son?

109
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:30,726
Hm.

110
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:34,098
The truth is, I don't even what to think anymore.

111
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:37,001
I've never been in a situation like this.

112
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:40,578
If Kira and the second Kira
are working together right now,

113
00:06:40,603 --> 00:06:42,288
things are not looking good for me.

114
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:48,369
Given that, I may not be thinking as
clearly as I normally do, so I could be wrong.

115
00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:55,419
Maybe I still consider him a suspect
only because we don't have anyone else.

116
00:06:56,211 --> 00:07:00,351
But still, if I do happen to be killed soon,

117
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:02,866
please assume that your son is Kira.

118
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:09,003
I have no choice but to make a sneak attack.

119
00:07:09,702 --> 00:07:11,896
This is all a wager now.

120
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:25,607
I wouldn't say that.

121
00:07:25,853 --> 00:07:28,307
I just know how to get by, that's all.

122
00:07:32,294 --> 00:07:34,296
Hey, what's wrong?

123
00:07:38,802 --> 00:07:39,811
Ah.

124
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:41,294
Hey, Light!

125
00:07:42,453 --> 00:07:43,419
How's it going?

126
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,277
Kiyomi, can we continue this later?

127
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,051
I need a moment alone with him.

128
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:51,840
Uh, OK.

129
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:57,689
I hope she's not upset.

130
00:07:58,094 --> 00:08:00,265
Never mind that. Is it OK to be here?

131
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,810
Didn't you say you were afraid to appear in public?

132
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:04,111
Yeah, I did.

133
00:08:04,136 --> 00:08:07,519
But then I realized that as long
as you're not Kira, I should be safe.

134
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:11,113
The fact is, you're the only one
on the outside who knows me as L.

135
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:14,517
In the unlikely event that I die in the next few days,

136
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:18,897
I've instructed your father and everyone
at headquarters to assume that you are Kira?

137
00:08:20,684 --> 00:08:22,138
Damn him.

138
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:28,245
Besides, you told me yourself that
you missed having me around at school,

139
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,653
so I figured, why not come
back for a little change of pace?

140
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:35,049
As long as it doesn't kill me, college is a lot of fun.

141
00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:39,565
I have to admit, without you around,
intelligent conversation is hard to come by.

142
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:42,396
I see. Luckily, Kyomi's there to fill the void.

143
00:08:42,454 --> 00:08:44,269
Well, something like that.

144
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:47,434
Oh, now I don't know.

145
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,673
Is it still OK to kill him today?

146
00:08:49,757 --> 00:08:53,444
No, as soon as I make the decision
to kill him, he suddenly appears,

147
00:08:53,469 --> 00:08:56,167
almost as if to distract me from my goal.

148
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:59,194
I guess he's trying to guarantee his safety.

149
00:08:59,219 --> 00:09:02,609
And the way things are, I'm playing right into his hands.

150
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:06,091
Hey, do you want to have some
cake with me in the cafeteria?

151
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,637
Sure. I have a break now anyway.

152
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:09,849
Mm. That's perfect.

153
00:09:09,874 --> 00:09:11,585
I'm kind of craving shortcake right now.

154
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:16,474
Well, let's hope they have it.

155
00:09:16,753 --> 00:09:18,655
Light, there you are!

156
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:22,665
I had a photo shoot nearby, so
I thought I'd come by to see you.

157
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,932
Misa, you idiot.

158
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:27,011
Oh, this must be a friend of yours.

159
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:29,403
He looks so different, unique.

160
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:31,620
Wait, I've won.

161
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,153
Misa will be able to see Ryuga's real name.

162
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,167
Hi, there. I'm Light's girlfriend, Misa Amane.

163
00:09:38,192 --> 00:09:39,265
Nice to meet you.

164
00:09:39,436 --> 00:09:41,303
I'm Hideki Ryuga.

165
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:42,005
Huh?

166
00:09:42,244 --> 00:09:43,655
Hideki Ryuga.

167
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,471
Yeah, he has the exact same first
and last name as the famous idol.

168
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,867
Pretty bizarre, huh?

169
00:09:49,378 --> 00:09:51,880
But it's different than the name I'm seeing.

170
00:09:53,045 --> 00:09:57,690
Ryuga, deciding to come here today was a mistake.

171
00:10:01,636 --> 00:10:03,834
Why the hell is he laughing?

172
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,288
Could it mean he knows something?

173
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:07,724
It makes no sense.

174
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:10,099
If he somehow guessed that she's the second Kira,

175
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:12,547
there's no way he'd be laughing right now.

176
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:14,741
Light,

177
00:10:16,337 --> 00:10:17,705
you're a lucky guy?

178
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:18,507
Huh?

179
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:22,395
I have been huge fan of yours ever
since the August issue of "Eighteen."

180
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:24,867
What? Really? That's so sweet of you?

181
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:27,286
Hey. Oh, my god. Isn't that girl Misa Misa?

182
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:29,165
You're right. It's her.

183
00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:30,440
Oh, she's so cute.

184
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:31,286
Oh, wow.

185
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:34,121
I should have guess I'd be
spotted with all these kids around.

186
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:35,626
I'm, like, your biggest fan.

187
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:36,618
Keep up the good work.

188
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:39,517
Oh, thank you. Couldn't do it without you.

189
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,225
What is this?

190
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:43,793
No way! Somebody just touched my butt.

191
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:44,753
Uh.

192
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:47,048
This is an outrage!

193
00:10:47,073 --> 00:10:50,036
Taking advantage of this situation is unforgivable.

194
00:10:50,061 --> 00:10:52,655
I will find whoever is responsible for this.

195
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:56,269
Oh, Ryuga. You're so funny.

196
00:10:56,603 --> 00:10:57,970
I want to touch her, too.

197
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:01,734
I want to ask Misa what L's
real name is as soon as possible,

198
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,267
but all these people are in the way.

199
00:11:05,136 --> 00:11:07,442
Misa, it's time.

200
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,340
Or were you planning to be late again?

201
00:11:09,365 --> 00:11:11,432
No, I'm... I'm sorry, Yoshi.

202
00:11:11,511 --> 00:11:12,411
Let's go.

203
00:11:12,578 --> 00:11:13,813
O... OK.

204
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,336
Perfect.

205
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:17,301
Now that Misa's away from the crowd,

206
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:20,423
I just have to give her a call and ask for L's real name.

207
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,979
Bye, Light. I'll see you after I'm done work.

208
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:24,482
Miss you already.

209
00:11:29,794 --> 00:11:32,320
Now, then. Perhaps we should get going.

210
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:33,440
Yeah.

211
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:36,855
Actually, could you go on ahead?
I need to go use the restroom.

212
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:39,470
Oh, OK, then. I'll see you there.

213
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:54,776
It's over.

214
00:11:55,469 --> 00:11:58,693
It's been fun, L.

215
00:11:59,195 --> 00:12:04,785
I'm grateful that I was the one to
discover your name, so I could kill you myself.

216
00:12:18,256 --> 00:12:21,119
L, it's been fun.

217
00:12:21,348 --> 00:12:24,248
I'm grateful that I was the one to discover your name,

218
00:12:24,283 --> 00:12:26,762
so I could kill you myself.

219
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,076
Yes?

220
00:12:55,923 --> 00:12:56,605
Hello?

221
00:12:57,624 --> 00:12:59,282
What do you mean, hello?

222
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:01,042
Oh, is that you, Light.

223
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:04,832
I guess must have dropped this phone
in all of the commotion earlier on.

224
00:13:04,874 --> 00:13:06,019
He took it.

225
00:13:06,782 --> 00:13:07,903
Bastard.

226
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:12,947
Uh, hello?

227
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:16,673
Yeah, that's... that's Misa's cell phone you have.

228
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:18,071
I can give it back to her.

229
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:20,063
Oh, I see. Sure, that makes sense.

230
00:13:25,558 --> 00:13:29,050
Ryuga, he probably thinks he's pretty clever right now.

231
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,842
But Misa has another phone he doesn't know about.

232
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:33,773
I'll just call that one instead.

233
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,346
Oh.

234
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:37,836
Oh, this time's it's actually my cell phone.

235
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:40,548
Yes?

236
00:13:41,432 --> 00:13:42,523
Yes, I see.

237
00:13:42,973 --> 00:13:44,219
So it's done then?

238
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:46,428
I understand.

239
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:51,323
I'm not exactly sure how you'll take this,

240
00:13:51,348 --> 00:13:54,171
but regarding Misa Amane,
there's something you should know.

241
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:58,309
We've taken her into custody under
suspicion of being the second Kira.

242
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,188
How long has he known about Misa?

243
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:05,630
I never thought he'd find her this quickly.

244
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:10,942
We gathered physical evidence from the
envelopes that were sent by the second Kira.

245
00:14:11,172 --> 00:14:15,733
In particular, we recovered hairs and
fibers from the masking tape used to seal them.

246
00:14:15,774 --> 00:14:18,018
They matched what we found in Misa's room.

247
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:22,541
There would be a public uproar if it gets out
that she's been apprehended as the second Kira.

248
00:14:22,566 --> 00:14:27,688
So officially, we've charged her manager with
drug possession, and she's a voluntary witness.

249
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:29,573
But I doubt any of this will get out.

250
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,028
I was careless.

251
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:39,480
The videos I should have destroyed all the evidence
before the police had a chance to go through it.

252
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:45,942
In the end, Ryuga knew that his best defense was
to stay close to me, rather than trying to hide.

253
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:47,834
He confronted things head on.

254
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:51,400
This wager was my...

255
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:52,830
was my...

256
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,323
was my...

257
00:14:56,552 --> 00:14:57,140
Hm?

258
00:14:58,413 --> 00:14:59,746
Not yet.

259
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:03,396
The real battle is just beginning, L.

260
00:15:12,683 --> 00:15:15,164
Watari, has she said anything yet?

261
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,255
No, she hasn't spoken a word.

262
00:15:17,824 --> 00:15:19,662
Get me a visual of her, will you?

263
00:15:19,782 --> 00:15:20,824
Are you sure?

264
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,232
Yes. And quickly.

265
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:32,880
Ryuzaki, what's the meaning of this?

266
00:15:34,174 --> 00:15:37,300
I've Apprehended her on
suspicion of being the second Kira.

267
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:39,132
I'm afraid thinks is necessary.

268
00:15:39,432 --> 00:15:41,493
Chances are, Amane is guilty.

269
00:15:41,849 --> 00:15:44,091
There seems to be enough evidence to convict her.

270
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,149
But all the same.

271
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,755
Yes, there can be no mistake.

272
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:50,031
Now we need a confession out of her.

273
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:55,539
We need to know how she kills, whether
she knows Kira, and if so, who he really is.

274
00:15:55,724 --> 00:15:58,124
Watari, take the necessary precautions.

275
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:01,093
But beyond that, you're free to
do whatever has to be done, OK?

276
00:16:01,716 --> 00:16:02,701
Just make her speak.

277
00:16:02,782 --> 00:16:03,593
Very well.

278
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:04,905
Oh, and Mr. Yagami?

279
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,530
Huh?

280
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:08,026
Light has now become our prime suspect.

281
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,962
And I'm probably going to bring
him in for interrogation as well.

282
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,868
Please be prepared for that.

283
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:35,447
Ryuzaki, Amane is talking.

284
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:36,534
Huh?

285
00:16:36,623 --> 00:16:38,509
Quickly, get me a visual and audio.

286
00:16:40,924 --> 00:16:43,515
Finally, after three days of this, huh?

287
00:16:45,774 --> 00:16:49,076
I... I can't take it anymore.

288
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:51,030
Kill me.

289
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:51,690
Huh?

290
00:16:52,382 --> 00:16:53,305
Kill me.

291
00:16:53,374 --> 00:16:55,053
Please just kill me.

292
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:59,278
I don't know. Maybe this was all
too much for a young girl to take.

293
00:16:59,717 --> 00:17:01,855
He's right. We've pushed her too far.

294
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:05,528
Misa Amane, can you hear me?

295
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,140
I hear you.

296
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:09,740
Please, just kill me now.

297
00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:14,767
Does this mean you admit to being the
second Kira? Is this the reason you wish to die.

298
00:17:14,957 --> 00:17:18,555
No. I don't know anything about the second Kira.

299
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:23,176
I really can't take this anymore. I'd rather be dead.

300
00:17:24,098 --> 00:17:26,049
Now hurry up and kill me!

301
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:29,380
If you wanted to, you could
kill me right now, couldn't you?

302
00:17:31,566 --> 00:17:33,815
Misa, do you mean.

303
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:34,707
Yes.

304
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:35,757
Kill me.

305
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,452
Do you really mean that, Misa?

306
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:40,665
Yes, I do.

307
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:46,068
I can't take it anymore. Kill me.

308
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:49,916
If I do this, then Light Yagami dies, too.

309
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,792
This is all his fault.

310
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:52,817
You can't.

311
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,016
No, you can't.

312
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,449
Please, just kill me.

313
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:56,663
Why, Misa?

314
00:17:56,922 --> 00:17:58,876
Why do you want to die for him?

315
00:18:00,908 --> 00:18:01,986
Fine!

316
00:18:02,156 --> 00:18:03,917
If you won't kill me.

317
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:06,620
Stop her! Watari, don't let her bite her tongue.

318
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:17,969
Is it possible that this behavior could be
attributed to Kira controlling her actions before death?

319
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:22,348
Oh, what's the matter, Rem?

320
00:18:24,847 --> 00:18:26,334
Light Yagami,

321
00:18:27,265 --> 00:18:30,414
Misa has refused my offer to help her escape,

322
00:18:30,715 --> 00:18:33,802
no doubt because she knows it would cause you trouble,

323
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,770
since the police would then have proof of her powers.

324
00:18:37,965 --> 00:18:40,976
When her suffering became more than she could bear,

325
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,422
she started begging me to kill her.

326
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:48,738
All of this because she wants you to love her.

327
00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:54,807
I could not possibly let it go on like that.

328
00:18:54,915 --> 00:18:56,930
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

329
00:18:57,591 --> 00:19:00,876
There was only one way to save her from her suffering.

330
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,016
Forfeiting ownership of the Death Note.

331
00:19:04,765 --> 00:19:05,793
Yes.

332
00:19:06,031 --> 00:19:09,064
If Misa forfeits ownership of the Death Note,

333
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:12,533
all her memories related to it would disappear.

334
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:15,241
All the murders she committed with it,

335
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:19,447
the fact that you are Kira all
those memories would be gone.

336
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,911
Your secret would be safe.

337
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:28,559
Also, Misa would no longer be
able to see Ryuk or me, either.

338
00:19:30,495 --> 00:19:31,518
Misa,

339
00:19:32,434 --> 00:19:37,014
when this is done, you'll forget
everything about Shinigami and the Death Note.

340
00:19:39,582 --> 00:19:40,882
It's OK.

341
00:19:41,257 --> 00:19:44,637
The human being who you love is Light Yagami.

342
00:19:44,957 --> 00:19:47,614
I promise those feelings will remain.

343
00:19:50,362 --> 00:19:54,595
So Misa, forfeit ownership of the Death Note,

344
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,355
and leave everything to Light Yagami.

345
00:19:58,982 --> 00:19:59,986
Mhm.

346
00:20:17,953 --> 00:20:18,763
Huh?

347
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:21,384
Hm.

348
00:20:29,615 --> 00:20:33,486
And so Misa is no longer the owner of a Death Note.

349
00:20:33,682 --> 00:20:35,449
You did the right thing, Rem.

350
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:38,905
I was beginning to think that was
the only way out of this situation.

351
00:20:39,674 --> 00:20:44,441
If her memories of the Death Note are gone, than
chances are, they'll have to release her eventually.

352
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:48,146
Light Yagami, I proposed this to Misa,

353
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:52,386
knowing it was exactly what you wanted
and that it would serve your purposes.

354
00:20:52,411 --> 00:20:54,512
But I did so on one condition.

355
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,671
And that is, if you don't save Misa, I will kill you.

356
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:09,270
I understand.

357
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,207
And I have a pretty good idea what L will do next.

358
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,189
I have a plan.

359
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:19,809
This is goodbye, Ryuk.

360
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:21,570
Huh?

361
00:22:37,643 --> 00:22:40,520
Yeah, I know I must look pretty bad in here.

362
00:22:40,545 --> 00:22:44,782
But this useless pride, I suppose I'll have to...

363
00:22:46,076 --> 00:22:47,076
Get rid of it.
