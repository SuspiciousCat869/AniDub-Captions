1
00:01:27,604 --> 00:01:30,393
Greetings to all of you at the ICPO.

2
00:01:30,505 --> 00:01:31,854
I am L.

3
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:34,729
Whether the guilty party is an individual or a group,

4
00:01:34,805 --> 00:01:37,126
there's a strong possibility that they're Japanese.

5
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:40,264
Kira, I've got a pretty good
idea what your motivation might be,

6
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:42,579
and I can guess what you hope to achieve.

7
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:47,171
However, what you're doing right now is evil.

8
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:49,170
You, you bastard.

9
00:01:49,195 --> 00:01:50,564
Now, try to kill me.

10
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:51,460
I am justice.

11
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:52,095
What the hell is going on?

12
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,431
I protect the innocent and those who fear evil.

13
00:01:54,456 --> 00:01:57,892
I'm the one who will become the god
of a new world that everyone desires.

14
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:58,724
L...

15
00:01:58,765 --> 00:01:59,728
Kira...

16
00:01:59,957 --> 00:02:03,408
I will hunt you down wherever you're
hiding, and I will eliminate you.

17
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:04,310
I am...

18
00:02:04,335 --> 00:02:05,366
I am...

19
00:02:05,936 --> 00:02:07,082
justice.

20
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:15,443
All right. Let's start with the tip line reports.

21
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,209
Yes, sir.

22
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:21,699
Up to this point, we've received 3,029
responses about the murders via telephone and email.

23
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:24,458
Most of these have been curious citizens and prank calls.

24
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:27,859
But there are 14 people who claim to either know Kira,

25
00:02:27,884 --> 00:02:29,023
or who have seen him.

26
00:02:30,502 --> 00:02:33,731
All 14 accounts were followed
up on, and carefully documented.

27
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:38,278
However, nobody could provide any information
that wasn't already publicly available.

28
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:44,734
And lastly, this week, there were an additional
21 people who called in claiming to be Kira.

29
00:02:49,138 --> 00:02:50,857
We didn't want to rule anything out,

30
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,280
so we followed standard procedure,
and created files for all 21 of them.

31
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,764
Uh huh. All right. Onto the victim reports.

32
00:02:58,993 --> 00:02:59,452
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:01,168 --> 00:03:02,831
Upon further investigation,

34
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:06,342
we have confirmed that information
of the heart attack victims

35
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:10,811
was in fact publicly available in
Japan immediately prior to their deaths.

36
00:03:12,462 --> 00:03:17,731
Also, concerning L's request that we
investigate the time of death for each victim,

37
00:03:17,953 --> 00:03:23,316
we found that all of them occurred between the
hours of 4:00 PM and 2:00 AM on weekdays, local time,

38
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:26,942
with 68% of them occurring between 8:00 PM and 12:00 AM.

39
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,157
Weekends and holidays appear
to be the exception to this rule,

40
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:33,393
as the times of death vary
much more widely during the week.

41
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,449
That information is extremely relevant for us.

42
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:39,160
It suggests that given the times of death,

43
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:42,301
our suspect could very well be a student.

44
00:03:42,673 --> 00:03:43,286
Hmm?

45
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:46,995
Based on the fact that Kira is only killing criminals,

46
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,408
I think it's safe to assume that he's
driven by very idealistic notion of justice.

47
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:55,385
It's highly possible he may even
aspire to be some sort of god-like figure.

48
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,666
We're dealing with an individual

49
00:03:56,692 --> 00:03:59,645
was very childish concept of right and wrong.

50
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:04,333
Of course, this is mere speculation at this point.

51
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:07,229
But still, I recommend you
re-examine any assumptions you've made

52
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:10,073
as to whether or not our suspect could be a student.

53
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:12,355
We must consider every possibility.

54
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:15,967
I believe that is the shortest
route to defining and arresting Kira.

55
00:04:16,254 --> 00:04:18,395
Please, continue with your report.

56
00:04:18,647 --> 00:04:19,293
Uh.

57
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:20,836
All right.

58
00:04:21,686 --> 00:04:23,755
Does anyone else have something they'd like to add?

59
00:04:24,092 --> 00:04:25,441
Uh, yes sir.

60
00:04:25,591 --> 00:04:27,126
What is it, Matsuda?

61
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:32,436
Um, well I'm not saying this to
support Kira, or to condone the murders,

62
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:35,935
but in the last few days throughout the world,

63
00:04:36,346 --> 00:04:38,146
but especially here in Japan,

64
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:42,291
we've observed a dramatic decrease in
the number of violent crimes committed.

65
00:04:43,623 --> 00:04:44,302
Uh.

66
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:47,631
Well, I suppose it makes sense.

67
00:04:47,673 --> 00:04:49,948
We've suspected something like that would happen.

68
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:51,061
Anything else?

69
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:52,710
No.

70
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:58,355
Well that about sums up our report for today. L?

71
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:00,058
Thank you, everyone.

72
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,525
I feel we're a one step closer to finding Kira.

73
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:06,448
Before I go, I'm afraid I have
one additional request to make.

74
00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:10,851
This is directed to the teams investigating
the victims, TV news, and Internet.

75
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:14,400
I would like you to go back and
take a closer look at the exact way

76
00:05:14,424 --> 00:05:16,942
in which the victims' identities were made public.

77
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:18,708
Be as thorough as possible.

78
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:23,713
In particular, I want to know if photos of the
victims were made available to the public in Japan.

79
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,209
I'll leave it to you.

80
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:28,799
Chief.

81
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:29,736
Mm?

82
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:31,695
You look like you could use one of these.

83
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,522
Sleepy much?

84
00:05:32,547 --> 00:05:34,621
Ah, thank you. That'll do the trick.

85
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:37,699
I feel all these late nights
are starting to take their toll.

86
00:05:41,109 --> 00:05:43,181
About what I said earlier at our meeting...

87
00:05:43,615 --> 00:05:44,820
well, now that I think about it,

88
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,049
um, I'm sure everyone already knew that.

89
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:48,521
I wanted to apologize.

90
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:50,655
What on earth are you talking about?

91
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:52,818
Nobody said it would be easy to speak the truth,

92
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,029
but it has to be done,

93
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:56,431
especially when it's something that isn't easy to say.

94
00:05:57,511 --> 00:05:58,101
Huh?

95
00:05:58,502 --> 00:05:59,631
Having said that,

96
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:04,806
if you'd gone on to say that we should commend Kira
for doing such a great job of reducing violent crime,

97
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:07,609
then yes, I might have had a little problem with that.

98
00:06:07,711 --> 00:06:09,112
Oh no. Uh, no, I wouldn't.

99
00:06:09,137 --> 00:06:10,341
That would never happen.

100
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,831
I'm just kidding.

101
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:15,668
I knew I could count on you, Light.

102
00:06:15,693 --> 00:06:16,236
Hey.

103
00:06:16,734 --> 00:06:19,103
So, do you think you're ready
to try a few on your own now?

104
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:19,613
Huh?

105
00:06:20,176 --> 00:06:20,954
Yeah.

106
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:22,243
I guess so.

107
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh, sounds like Dad's home.

108
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:27,830
Welcome home, dear.

109
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:29,263
Thank you.

110
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,150
He's home really early today.

111
00:06:31,175 --> 00:06:31,900
Hey!

112
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,700
Why don't you at least try the last problem by yourself?

113
00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:37,300
I will, but maybe after dinner.

114
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:38,465
Yeah, right.

115
00:06:40,202 --> 00:06:42,065
Helping your sister with her homework.

116
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,555
You sure are relaxed.

117
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:44,636
Of course.

118
00:06:44,808 --> 00:06:46,305
If the police try to come after me,

119
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,411
I'm pretty confident I've got
something that'll give me the advantage.

120
00:06:51,798 --> 00:06:53,819
Hey, glad you could join us for dinner.

121
00:06:53,844 --> 00:06:54,749
You hungry, Dad?

122
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:55,494
Yeah.

123
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:57,166
It's been a long day.

124
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:05,757
So, Light.

125
00:07:05,914 --> 00:07:07,630
Tell me, how are your studies going?

126
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,760
Hmm?

127
00:07:09,086 --> 00:07:10,309
Everything's OK, I guess.

128
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:12,546
Whatever. He's at the top of his class.

129
00:07:12,627 --> 00:07:14,306
My big brother's a genius.

130
00:07:14,548 --> 00:07:16,988
That's my son. We're all proud of you, Light.

131
00:07:17,293 --> 00:07:18,491
Is everything OK, Dad?

132
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:19,601
You look tired.

133
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,583
Yeah.

134
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:23,072
I'm not able to say too much about it,

135
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,371
but this case I'm working now is really tough.

136
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:28,402
I see.

137
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:32,240
Well, well. Daddy's a police man.

138
00:07:32,896 --> 00:07:35,874
And that must be the reason why you're so confident?

139
00:07:36,045 --> 00:07:36,906
That's right.

140
00:07:37,192 --> 00:07:39,426
It's easy for me to hack into Dad's computer.

141
00:07:39,451 --> 00:07:43,104
We're on a home network, so I can copy
the files I need without leaving a trace.

142
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:45,901
This way, I can keep track of their investigation.

143
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:48,467
There we go.

144
00:07:58,918 --> 00:07:59,489
Hmm.

145
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,589
Well, isn't that interesting?

146
00:08:03,752 --> 00:08:06,790
Looks like the police are already
beginning to suspect a student.

147
00:08:08,945 --> 00:08:10,749
I guess that means you're in trouble.

148
00:08:11,313 --> 00:08:11,986
Hmm.

149
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:21,797
If the cause of death is written within 40
seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.

150
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,239
If the cause of death is not specified,

151
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:27,453
the person will simply die of a heart attack.

152
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,991
After writing the cause of death, details of the death
should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.

153
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:34,437
That sound right to you, Ryuk?

154
00:08:35,085 --> 00:08:36,510
So what's your point?

155
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:39,912
In other words, if I write
heart attack as the cause of death,

156
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:44,465
then I should be able to write down all the
details, including time of death afterward, shouldn't I?

157
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,712
Looks like I'll be able to provide
you with more entertainment now.

158
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:17,872
Huh?

159
00:09:17,944 --> 00:09:19,856
Inmate 148, what's wrong?

160
00:09:19,881 --> 00:09:21,095
Snap out of it.

161
00:09:37,465 --> 00:09:38,007
What?

162
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,853
I... I don't believe this.

163
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:43,537
Another 23 victims yesterday? Are these confirmed?

164
00:09:43,732 --> 00:09:44,364
Yes.

165
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:48,002
The day before, there were another 23 victims.

166
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:51,030
He's killing one off every hour, on the hour.

167
00:09:51,473 --> 00:09:54,841
Considering that this new pattern
has been going on for two weekdays...

168
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:58,385
It does punch some holes in the
theory that our suspect is a student.

169
00:09:58,579 --> 00:09:59,294
Maybe not.

170
00:09:59,343 --> 00:10:01,054
Anybody can skip two days of school.

171
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:02,500
You're missing the point.

172
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:07,339
It does appear less likely now that Kira's a student.

173
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:10,116
But that's not the message he's sending by doing this.

174
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:12,901
Ask yourselves, why every hour?

175
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:16,745
And why are all these victims in prisons
where they are sure to be discovered immediately?

176
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:18,878
Why not other criminals like before?

177
00:10:19,404 --> 00:10:23,412
I believe Kira is telling us that
not only can he kill from a distance,

178
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:26,051
but he can also determine the time of death.

179
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:31,643
But, something's not right.

180
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:35,631
As soon as we began to suspect
that Kira might be a student,

181
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,603
the pacing of the killings changed,

182
00:10:37,694 --> 00:10:39,236
as if to contradict that theory.

183
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:40,601
Coincidence?

184
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:43,146
No. Too convenient.

185
00:10:43,938 --> 00:10:48,024
This can only mean that Kira
has access to police information.

186
00:10:48,701 --> 00:10:49,737
It's obvious now.

187
00:10:50,135 --> 00:10:52,235
This is a direct challenge to me.

188
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:57,593
I'd say L is probably starting to sweat a little by now.

189
00:10:57,989 --> 00:10:59,881
What'll really make his job difficult is that

190
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:03,315
I've deliberately left about 50
criminals alive for times like this.

191
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:04,145
Oh?

192
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:06,029
If L's as good as they say,

193
00:11:06,054 --> 00:11:08,444
by now he should be starting to suspect someone

194
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:09,985
with connections to the police.

195
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:16,411
So Kira has found a way to obtain
information from the task force headquarters.

196
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:19,148
This is one fact that cannot be ignored.

197
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:22,021
But what does he get out of all this?

198
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:25,102
What is he hoping to achieve in the end?

199
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:29,445
There's one thing I don't get.

200
00:11:30,058 --> 00:11:32,188
Showing them you have connections to the police

201
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:33,854
makes it easier for them to find you

202
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:36,175
than when they just suspected you were a student.

203
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:40,396
Well, my real agenda is to get close to L,

204
00:11:40,421 --> 00:11:41,735
so I can eliminate him.

205
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,249
How are you going to do that?

206
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:45,906
You still don't understand human beings.

207
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:49,360
In this world, there are very few
people who actually trust each other.

208
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:51,947
And it's no different for the police, you know.

209
00:11:52,906 --> 00:11:57,561
What's especially important is that L and
the investigators don't trust each other at all.

210
00:11:57,821 --> 00:11:58,579
Think about it.

211
00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:01,158
Could you trust someone whose
name and face you don't even know?

212
00:12:01,696 --> 00:12:04,890
When L discovers that I'm somehow
getting confidential information,

213
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:09,241
he'll be obligated to start investigating
the police to find the source of the leak.

214
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:14,450
When that happens, it'll only be a matter
of time before the police start resenting L.

215
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:18,439
On the surface, it will appear
that L and the investigation team

216
00:12:18,464 --> 00:12:20,450
are working together to try to catch me.

217
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:24,545
But in reality, L will investigate the police,

218
00:12:24,636 --> 00:12:26,553
and they will be investigating L.

219
00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:29,360
I'm not the one who's going to find L.

220
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,156
I can let the police do that for me.

221
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,275
And when they do, that's when I'll eliminate him.

222
00:12:46,992 --> 00:12:47,971
What's this about?

223
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,183
With all due respect, Chief, we're resigning.

224
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:56,965
We demand that you assign us to a different case.

225
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:59,158
Otherwise, you can have our badges right here and now.

226
00:12:59,205 --> 00:12:59,825
Why?

227
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:01,186
You're good cops.

228
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:02,227
Isn't it clear?

229
00:13:02,555 --> 00:13:04,511
It's because we value our lives, sir.

230
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:10,380
If what L says is true, Kira has some ESP like
power that somehow allows him to kill people indirectly,

231
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:11,636
from anywhere.

232
00:13:11,884 --> 00:13:13,275
Well, if I were Kira, sir,

233
00:13:13,353 --> 00:13:16,423
I'd probably want to try and get rid of
the people who were trying to catch me.

234
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:19,144
Let's face it. He knows he'll be
sentenced to death if he's caught.

235
00:13:19,438 --> 00:13:24,616
We all sat here and watched when L decided to
pull that media stunt and challenge Kira to kill him.

236
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:26,626
Well, it was all very impressive at the time.

237
00:13:26,987 --> 00:13:30,385
But then again, L never had to show his
face, or reveal his name, for that matter.

238
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:33,081
I'm sure you recall L's last request.

239
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:37,040
He asked that we take a closer look at how
these victims' identities were made public,

240
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:41,980
and specifically to determine whether photos of the
victims were available to the public prior to their deaths.

241
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:45,031
Well, it turns out he was right.

242
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:49,791
Every single one of those victims' names and photos
were broadcast to the Japanese public, and then they died.

243
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:51,579
Unlike someone we know,

244
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:55,818
we're out there investigating this case wearing
police IDs with our names and photos on them.

245
00:13:56,037 --> 00:13:58,283
Anybody with a computer can find out who we are.

246
00:13:58,575 --> 00:14:00,694
We don't hide our faces. We're out in the open.

247
00:14:00,943 --> 00:14:04,616
Sir, the truth is, we could be killed by Kira at any time.

248
00:14:05,435 --> 00:14:08,439
For these reasons, we refuse
to continue working this case.

249
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:10,121
Excuse us, Chief.

250
00:14:11,044 --> 00:14:12,255
Hey, stop.

251
00:14:12,338 --> 00:14:14,645
All of you, hold it right there.

252
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:20,997
Huh?

253
00:14:21,184 --> 00:14:27,731
In order to solve this problem, we must
establish the concept that x squared equals large N.

254
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:29,843
Now pay attention, because this is important.

255
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:32,316
Before we tackle more complex quadratic equations,

256
00:14:32,341 --> 00:14:37,684
we have to start thinking of large x's
value as simply the multiple of two integers.

257
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:40,776
Now, let's apply this concept to our first problem.

258
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:47,828
We brought the FBI to Japan four days ago.

259
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,157
They're fully operational.

260
00:14:49,216 --> 00:14:51,910
As requested, they're now gathering intel on the police.

261
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,688
And this is the complete list?

262
00:14:53,713 --> 00:14:54,317
Yes.

263
00:14:55,662 --> 00:15:02,251
There are 141 people in the police force who have access
to classified information regarding the investigation.

264
00:15:02,461 --> 00:15:07,689
I am sure that somewhere in this list of
police officers and the people closest to them,

265
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:11,377
we will find our suspect.

266
00:15:15,432 --> 00:15:17,311
Light, you got a second?

267
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:21,206
I already told you Ryuk, you can't talk to me in public.

268
00:15:21,431 --> 00:15:23,159
How many times do I have to tell you?

269
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:25,740
In that case, I'll talk. You just listen.

270
00:15:25,944 --> 00:15:28,755
If you don't want to hear me,
you can plug your ears or something.

271
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,878
First of all, I don't have anything against you.

272
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:35,742
I actually think the notebook couldn't
have been picked up by a better person.

273
00:15:36,023 --> 00:15:41,689
I'm here 'cause I have to stick around 'til the Death
Note is finished, or I see you die, whichever comes first.

274
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:46,603
But make no mistake, Light,
I'm not on your side or L's side.

275
00:15:47,953 --> 00:15:50,210
Yeah, well I knew that much already.

276
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,501
You'll never hear me say anything about
whether what you're doing is right or wrong.

277
00:15:54,526 --> 00:15:57,142
I'm not here to support you, or give you my opinion.

278
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:58,657
I'm just a spectator.

279
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:02,449
But as your roommate, I might have
a few things to say now and then.

280
00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:04,121
What's this about, Ryuk?

281
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,336
Why are you telling me all this stuff now, anyway?

282
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,529
It's really not like you.

283
00:16:08,554 --> 00:16:12,401
It's just that I'm no ally of
yours, or Kira's, if you prefer.

284
00:16:12,426 --> 00:16:16,756
The only reason I'm going to tell you this is
because personally, it's starting to creep me out.

285
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:18,349
Get to the point, already.

286
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:23,230
You're being followed by another human.

287
00:16:23,255 --> 00:16:24,963
He's watching you right now.

288
00:16:40,972 --> 00:16:43,390
It's really starting to get on my nerves.

289
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:46,165
I realize there's no way he can see me.

290
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:49,856
But because I'm always following
behind you wherever you go,

291
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,747
I feel like I'm constantly being watched.

292
00:16:53,272 --> 00:16:54,473
That's a problem.

293
00:16:54,956 --> 00:16:57,634
I'll have to get rid of him as soon as possible.

294
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:02,837
Who would be following me?

295
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,703
Does this mean L is already
starting to suspect the police?

296
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,437
If he's going to investigate the police,
he'll need a lot of resources and manpower.

297
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:16,850
Even if he has as many as 50 people on the case,

298
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,418
I don't see how they could ever figure out that I'm Kira.

299
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,317
I shouldn't look like anything other
than your average high school senior.

300
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:26,862
But the longer I let this person keep following me,

301
00:17:27,258 --> 00:17:30,101
the greater the chance is
they'll figure out who I really am.

302
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:33,879
Above all, I need my stalker's name.

303
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:37,830
Once I figure that out, I can get rid of him for good.

304
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,614
Light.

305
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:39,490
Hmm?

306
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,420
I'm going to let you in on a little secret.

307
00:17:42,832 --> 00:17:46,191
What makes a shinigami and a
human who has a Death Note different?

308
00:17:46,354 --> 00:17:48,066
Well, there are two things.

309
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:53,514
And why do shinigami have to write
the names of humans in their Death Notes?

310
00:17:53,582 --> 00:17:54,954
You got any ideas?

311
00:17:55,228 --> 00:17:57,418
Of course not. Why would I know that?

312
00:17:57,935 --> 00:18:00,850
You know, you sure are talkative today.

313
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:05,074
It's because we are able to
take human lifespans for ourselves.

314
00:18:05,156 --> 00:18:05,724
Huh?

315
00:18:05,848 --> 00:18:07,561
Wait, what do you mean by that?

316
00:18:07,691 --> 00:18:11,250
Let's say you have a human who
is due to live until the age of 60,

317
00:18:11,275 --> 00:18:14,457
and a god of death wrote that this person would die at 40.

318
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:17,910
60 minus 40 equals 20.

319
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:21,189
Now, those 20 years taken from someone in the human world

320
00:18:21,214 --> 00:18:23,503
are added to that god of death's life.

321
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:24,629
Huh.

322
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,572
So it means that as long as we don't slack off,

323
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:30,056
even if someone was to shoot us in the head,

324
00:18:30,305 --> 00:18:32,226
or stab us in the heart with a knife,

325
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:34,060
a god of death cannot die.

326
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:38,471
On the other hand, no matter how
many names you write in your Death Note,

327
00:18:38,496 --> 00:18:40,605
your lifespan will not increase.

328
00:18:40,804 --> 00:18:45,352
That is the first difference between gods
of death and humans who possess a Death Note.

329
00:18:45,682 --> 00:18:46,494
Huh.

330
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:49,449
That's something about shinigami
that I haven't heard before.

331
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,723
Pretty interesting stuff.

332
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:56,382
The second difference between us will
probably be of even greater interest to you.

333
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:59,230
Though this has less to do with lengthening life,

334
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:01,159
and more to do with cutting it short.

335
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:02,571
What do you mean cutting it short?

336
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,541
Shinigami can tell what a person's
name is by just looking at their face.

337
00:19:07,577 --> 00:19:08,867
We know instantly.

338
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,318
And do you have any idea why?

339
00:19:11,956 --> 00:19:16,321
Because through a shinigami's eyes, a
human's name can be seen about their head.

340
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:19,558
Not only that, we see their lifespan as well.

341
00:19:19,964 --> 00:19:22,006
Their name and lifespan?

342
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:24,502
That's right.

343
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:27,764
I'm able to see your name and lifespan right now.

344
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:33,211
If I converted that to human time, I
could tell you how many years you've got left.

345
00:19:33,368 --> 00:19:35,548
But there's no way I'd ever tell you that.

346
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:39,471
I may have a big mouth, but even I wouldn't go that far.

347
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:47,353
Shinigami never have to worry that they won't be able
to kill a person just because they don't know their name.

348
00:19:47,802 --> 00:19:49,599
And every time we do take a life,

349
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:52,999
we always know exactly how
many years we're going to receive.

350
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,708
Our eyes just aren't the same,

351
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:58,439
and that is the difference between you and I.

352
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:03,343
However, if a shinigami drops his Death Note,

353
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,844
and human picks it up,

354
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:08,379
he can grant that humanity the eyes of a shinigami.

355
00:20:08,998 --> 00:20:11,227
But only if a deal is made,

356
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,552
one that's been with us since ancient times.

357
00:20:13,577 --> 00:20:14,772
And what's the deal?

358
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:18,598
The price for having a shinigami's eyes...

359
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,672
is half of that person's remaining lifespan.

360
00:20:23,871 --> 00:20:25,148
That's all it is.

361
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,216
Half of my remaining lifespan.

362
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:29,589
Yeah.

363
00:20:30,006 --> 00:20:34,569
In other words, if you were supposed
to live another 50 years, it'll be 25.

364
00:20:34,804 --> 00:20:37,186
If it was one more year, then six months.

365
00:20:37,664 --> 00:20:38,688
I see.

366
00:20:38,912 --> 00:20:41,556
And since you've made it clear
you're not on anyone's side,

367
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:42,954
and won't help me out,

368
00:20:42,979 --> 00:20:45,327
you wouldn't just give me the
names of people I wanted to kill.

369
00:20:46,098 --> 00:20:49,591
Basically, you're saying that I
can't simply borrow your powers.

370
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:51,581
I'd have to pay for them.

371
00:20:51,907 --> 00:20:52,902
That's right.

372
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:56,597
It's a key part of the code
that all shinigami are bound by.

373
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,796
I'll say this once more.

374
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,575
Give me half your remaining lifespan,

375
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,194
and I'll give you the shinigami eyes.

376
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:05,468
If I agree,

377
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:09,518
I'll be able to know everyone's
name just by looking at them.

378
00:21:09,965 --> 00:21:13,331
If I had that power, the Death
Note would only be easier to use.

379
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:16,444
So, what'll it be, Light?

380
00:21:16,746 --> 00:21:17,745
Is it a deal?

381
00:22:37,968 --> 00:22:42,363
Everything has turned out exactly as I
wrote it in the Death Note, to the last detail.

382
00:22:42,517 --> 00:22:45,159
11:45, on the dot.

383
00:22:45,235 --> 00:22:47,422
Everything is going just as I planned.

384
00:22:47,494 --> 00:22:49,915
The Death Note never fails.
