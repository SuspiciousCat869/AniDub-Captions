1
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:30,887
The human whose name is written
in this notebook shall die.

2
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,918
Help me!

3
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:36,471
Now, what will happen?

4
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:40,683
The Death Note.

5
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:42,459
It's for real.

6
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,314
Any human whose used a Death Note

7
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:53,044
can neither to go to heaven nor hell for eternity.

8
00:01:53,705 --> 00:01:56,970
I want the world to know of my existence.

9
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,796
That there's someone out there
passing righteous judgment on the wicked.

10
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,152
And I... I will become the god of this new world.

11
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:11,891
He found himself overwhelmed
with happiness and satisfaction...

12
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,031
I have no idea what he was thinking coming to my house...

13
00:02:14,063 --> 00:02:15,333
but I am so through with him.

14
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:16,199
Seriously?

15
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:18,150
So happened with your dad after that?

16
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:19,756
All right then, Yagami?

17
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:20,212
Mhm?

18
00:02:20,758 --> 00:02:22,562
Please recite this line for us.

19
00:02:22,665 --> 00:02:23,729
Sure.

20
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:29,417
"Having finally made his dream
a reality, he was overwhelmed,

21
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:34,174
both by the magnitude of his achievement and
by the joy and happiness that it brought him."

22
00:02:35,267 --> 00:02:38,426
That was very well done, but I'm not surprised, of course.

23
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,098
Absolutely flawless. Very good.

24
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:46,645
Well, then we'll leave it that for today.

25
00:02:53,278 --> 00:02:54,985
I thought it would never end.

26
00:02:55,192 --> 00:02:57,672
How do you do this everyday? It's so boring here.

27
00:02:57,698 --> 00:02:59,109
Hey, were are you going?

28
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:01,570
Hey, Light, are you listening to me?

29
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:02,920
Don't talk to me.

30
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:06,792
Unlike you, people can still hear me when I talk out loud.

31
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,750
Huh. Well, aren't you boring?

32
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:10,194
Hey. What's up, Light?

33
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:11,292
We were just get ahead down...

34
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:12,976
Sorry, I'm a little busy today.

35
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,990
You don't have anything to do.

36
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:19,427
Aren't you just going to go home
and hang out in your room, as usual?

37
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,681
What are you talking about?

38
00:03:20,706 --> 00:03:22,403
Of course I have something to.

39
00:03:22,634 --> 00:03:23,486
Yes.

40
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:25,486
Something very important.

41
00:03:28,103 --> 00:03:30,478
There was more violence across the city today.

42
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:35,464
Another stabbing, this time at a restaurant in
the heart of the Kabukicho District of Shinjuku.

43
00:03:37,997 --> 00:03:39,059
Hey, Light.

44
00:03:39,868 --> 00:03:41,359
I'm talking to you.

45
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:42,328
What is it?

46
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:45,246
Why are you working so hard?

47
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:47,843
I can't afford to waste any time.

48
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,778
I have a very small window to
write names in this notebook.

49
00:03:51,436 --> 00:03:54,354
I only have from when I get
home from school until I go to bed.

50
00:03:54,453 --> 00:03:58,326
I still need to sleep, so I can maintain
my average and stay at the top my class.

51
00:03:58,365 --> 00:04:00,906
Obviously, I can't be sleeping in class.

52
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:03,780
Plus, there's all the studying at home and at cram school.

53
00:04:03,837 --> 00:04:05,712
I can't let myself get too tired.

54
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:08,799
It'll start to affect my health and my mental performance.

55
00:04:08,844 --> 00:04:12,728
If I'm serious about trying to create
an ideal world that's free from evil,

56
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:16,384
then I need to make the most of my time.

57
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:18,202
Huh? Weird.

58
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:19,711
Hey, Light! What's going on?

59
00:04:19,736 --> 00:04:20,754
Why's your door locked?

60
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:22,416
It's Sayu.

61
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:23,558
What is it?

62
00:04:23,718 --> 00:04:25,279
Can you help me with my homework?

63
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:27,687
Uh. Yeah. OK.

64
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:32,853
We're doing quadratic equations in math.

65
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:34,872
Sorry to interupt.

66
00:04:34,897 --> 00:04:36,275
I know you're studying right now.

67
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:39,180
But I'm, like, the only person in
my class who doesn't get this stuff.

68
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:40,594
Thanks so much.

69
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:41,673
No problem.

70
00:04:41,788 --> 00:04:43,927
I'd be careful if I were to you.

71
00:04:44,358 --> 00:04:48,217
If anyone else touches that notebook
you've got hidden in the drawer right now,

72
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:49,984
they'll be able to see me, too.

73
00:04:50,042 --> 00:04:50,727
Uh huh.

74
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:53,642
He waits till now to mention that important detail?

75
00:04:53,743 --> 00:04:55,348
Damn shinigami.

76
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:56,261
What's wrong?

77
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,283
Are you all right?

78
00:04:57,701 --> 00:04:58,842
It's nothing.

79
00:04:59,142 --> 00:05:01,315
So what exactly don't you understand?

80
00:05:01,394 --> 00:05:02,412
What are you stuck on?

81
00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:05,316
Um. Well, I think all of it.

82
00:05:05,894 --> 00:05:08,456
There have been 52 deaths that we're aware of.

83
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:09,977
And that's just in the past week.

84
00:05:10,002 --> 00:05:12,249
Every single one of them involved a heart attack.

85
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:15,205
They were all criminals who
were either being held in prison

86
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:17,623
or who were wanted by police for outstanding crimes.

87
00:05:17,674 --> 00:05:21,620
And I think it's safe to say, there are
other criminals whose deaths are unaccounted for.

88
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:25,224
In which case the death toll could be well over 100.

89
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:30,040
Uh. Morning, Chief. They started the meeting without you.

90
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:31,637
That's fine.

91
00:05:31,662 --> 00:05:34,120
I had to take an urgent call from headquarters.

92
00:05:34,273 --> 00:05:39,228
At any rate, these were criminals who would
probably facing execution sooner or later.

93
00:05:39,357 --> 00:05:40,342
Perhaps we shouldn't wait...

94
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:43,028
Why should it matter whether
it's a criminal or someone innocent?

95
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:45,412
Last time I checked, murder was still murder.

96
00:05:45,437 --> 00:05:48,090
It's still too early to consider these a homicide.

97
00:05:48,135 --> 00:05:51,495
Then how did all these people have
heart attacks at the exact same time?

98
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,365
That's not coincidence! It's murder!

99
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:58,215
Do you think it's possible to simultaneously
kill all these people in different locations?

100
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,352
We're treating this has an elaborate murder plot
that's been carried out by a large organization.

101
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,369
If it is a large organization,

102
00:06:04,394 --> 00:06:08,340
I'm sure I'm not alone in suspecting the FBI or CIA.

103
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:10,221
I dare you to say that again.

104
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:13,106
Now, now this is not the time to be joking around.

105
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:17,306
We need to confirm that these are,
indeed, homicides and not coincidences.

106
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:22,229
How? Autopsy results showed that all of these
cases the victims died of a sudden heart attack.

107
00:06:22,254 --> 00:06:25,162
Investigating a series of heart attacks is pointless.

108
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:26,791
I don't see what else we can learn.

109
00:06:26,816 --> 00:06:31,411
Absolutely, if these people had been shot or
stabbed, at least we'd have something to go on.

110
00:06:31,747 --> 00:06:35,607
If that's the case, it looks as if
we'll have no choice but to bring in L.

111
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,456
I can't believe...

112
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,932
Uh, Chief, what's this L they're talking about?

113
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,693
Right.

114
00:06:45,883 --> 00:06:48,405
I forgot that is your first time at this conference.

115
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,761
We don't know L's real name or whereabouts.

116
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:53,017
In fact, we still don't even know what it looks like.

117
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:57,198
However, he's managed to solve
every case he's ever taken on.

118
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,691
And he's tackled some of the greatest
mysteries this world has ever known.

119
00:07:00,756 --> 00:07:02,331
He hides in the shadows.

120
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:05,373
But he's the best of the best, a last resort,

121
00:07:05,398 --> 00:07:06,564
our trump card.

122
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:09,412
But I've hear this L is extremely arrogant.

123
00:07:09,437 --> 00:07:12,600
I understand he'll only take on cases
that he's personally interested in.

124
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:13,830
That's exactly right.

125
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:16,659
Besides, we don't even know how to contact him.

126
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,474
L is already on the move.

127
00:07:30,922 --> 00:07:35,151
Gentleman, L has already begun his
investigation into these incidents.

128
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:36,406
What? What the heck?

129
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:37,819
Huh? Who's that?

130
00:07:38,352 --> 00:07:41,236
That man's the only known person who can contact L.

131
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,676
Nobody knows his true identity either.

132
00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:46,196
Please be silent.

133
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,963
L would like to address the delegates.

134
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:55,874
Greetings to all of you at the ICPO.

135
00:07:57,031 --> 00:07:58,746
I am L.

136
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:01,847
What are we doing here anyway?

137
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:04,214
I don't understand why we're sneaking about this dump.

138
00:08:04,257 --> 00:08:05,063
Tell me.

139
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,453
Isn't it obvious?

140
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,708
You told me that anyone touches the
Death Note will be able to see you.

141
00:08:09,932 --> 00:08:13,210
I can afford to carry something
this dangerous with me anymore.

142
00:08:13,763 --> 00:08:15,039
Up until now,

143
00:08:15,104 --> 00:08:17,736
I thought that if my family ever saw the notebook,

144
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:20,098
I could tell them I was keeping
records of various criminals

145
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:22,549
in preparation for becoming a detective one day.

146
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,673
But I'm walking a very fine line right now.

147
00:08:26,602 --> 00:08:28,181
I don't want to think about it.

148
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:29,694
But if I make one mistake,

149
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,213
I might end up killing my own family.

150
00:08:39,556 --> 00:08:43,088
The difficulty of this case
lies in its unprecedented scope.

151
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,321
And make no mistake,

152
00:08:44,532 --> 00:08:46,901
we're witnessing an atrocious act of mass murder.

153
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,471
One that is unforgivable.

154
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:53,114
This case cannot be solved without
the full corporation of the ICPO.

155
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:56,926
That is, all of the police organizations
you represent throughout the world.

156
00:08:57,146 --> 00:09:01,626
You need to make the decision to fully
support the investigation at this meeting.

157
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,224
Also I require additional corporation
from Japan's national police agency.

158
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:07,846
Huh?

159
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:10,178
What? Why Japan in particular?

160
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:16,283
Whether the guilty party as an individual or a
group, there's a strong possibility that they're Japanese.

161
00:09:16,483 --> 00:09:19,835
And even if they're not, we can
be sure they're hiding in Japan.

162
00:09:19,954 --> 00:09:21,655
What is all this based on?

163
00:09:22,247 --> 00:09:23,925
Why Japan you ask?

164
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:29,044
I think I'll be able to provide you proof
of that after I directly confront the culprit.

165
00:09:29,688 --> 00:09:31,343
A direct confrontation?

166
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:35,985
At any rate, I would like to set up
the investigation headquarters in Japan.

167
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:43,052
That was easier to make that I thought it'd be.

168
00:09:43,077 --> 00:09:43,678
Huh?

169
00:09:43,975 --> 00:09:46,441
Does that mean you were able to hide the notebook?

170
00:09:46,593 --> 00:09:47,428
Yeah.

171
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,435
I hid it right here in this drawer.

172
00:09:49,781 --> 00:09:52,575
But it just seemed to be particularly well hidden.

173
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:54,884
You left the key in the lock.

174
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,347
And that's the whole point.

175
00:09:56,605 --> 00:10:00,392
I intentionally left the key in the
most noticeable place I could think of.

176
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,179
Isn't that just a regular diary?

177
00:10:05,473 --> 00:10:06,508
That's what it is.

178
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:09,436
I'm guessing that once most
people find the diary inside my desk,

179
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,003
that'll probably satisfy their curiosity.

180
00:10:12,548 --> 00:10:16,099
But the real key is this.

181
00:10:16,312 --> 00:10:19,539
Just in every day item that you'd
expect to find lying around on my desk,

182
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,449
a regular ballpoint pen.

183
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:23,407
And all I need is this part.

184
00:10:23,432 --> 00:10:25,123
So that's the key?

185
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:26,250
Yeah.

186
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,851
If you look closely, you'll find
there's a small hole underneath the drawer.

187
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,973
Then you just insert this.

188
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:39,573
Ah! A fake bottom.

189
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,082
The diary will distract most
people, so I doubt anyone will find it.

190
00:10:44,107 --> 00:10:45,217
But that's not all.

191
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,936
Even if someone figures out that there's a fake base,

192
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:52,436
I've set things up so that there's no way
they could get their hands on the notebook.

193
00:10:54,265 --> 00:10:58,089
You see once the ink reservoir is
inserted in acts as an insulator,

194
00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:00,675
preventing the flow of electricity around this circuit.

195
00:11:01,538 --> 00:11:03,574
When the fake base of the drawer is put back,

196
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:06,418
this piece of rubber also
prevents the flow of electricity.

197
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:10,434
However, if someone were to try and
force the bottom of the drawer open,

198
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:11,853
the circuit would connect

199
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,461
and that would ignite the gasoline
contained in this thin plastic casing,

200
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:18,632
instantly setting the notebook on fire.

201
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,282
The way I've got it set up,

202
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:23,008
all the evidence would be completely destroyed.

203
00:11:23,592 --> 00:11:24,638
If I'm ever questioned,

204
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,496
I'll just say that I was hiding the real diary

205
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:28,381
because I didn't want anyone to see.

206
00:11:28,406 --> 00:11:30,454
It sounds like a pretty believable excuse.

207
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:33,227
I mean, it is my diary after all.

208
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,717
I've heard of humans finding Death Notes in the past.

209
00:11:36,742 --> 00:11:40,605
And typically the biggest problem they
have is find a good place to hide it.

210
00:11:40,715 --> 00:11:42,134
But you, Light,

211
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,981
you're probably the first to
have given it this much thought,

212
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:47,885
though it's a pretty risky set up from the look of it.

213
00:11:48,561 --> 00:11:52,661
If you make even the slightest
mistake, you could be badly burned.

214
00:11:52,843 --> 00:11:53,694
Risky.

215
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:55,969
You say the strangest things sometimes, Ryuk.

216
00:11:56,822 --> 00:12:01,441
This whole thing has been a risk since the very
beginning, from the moment I obtain the Death Note.

217
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,509
I'm sorry but compared to that,

218
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:06,720
this doesn't even qualify as a risk to me.

219
00:12:06,878 --> 00:12:09,592
In fact, it actually protects me.

220
00:12:10,053 --> 00:12:14,860
It all comes down to a choice. Would I prefer
to be executed or deal with a little house fire?

221
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,906
Last night in the West Tokyo Penitentiary,

222
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:32,912
Nyoki Korishkiyama, originally
sentenced to 15 years for armed robbery

223
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:36,617
is reported to have died of a
sudden heart attack at the age of 32.

224
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:41,073
This is just the most recent death in a steadily
growing number of cases involving inmates dying...

225
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:42,065
This is unbelievable.

226
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,894
Criminals are dropping like flies lately.

227
00:12:44,068 --> 00:12:45,172
It's a little scary.

228
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,953
But at the same time, it's kind of cool.

229
00:12:47,554 --> 00:12:48,985
Just make sure you don't do anything bad.

230
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,283
I wouldn't be surprised if the police were behind this.

231
00:12:51,308 --> 00:12:52,179
No way.

232
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,100
The police don't have that kind of power.

233
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,060
Don't you know about him?

234
00:12:55,085 --> 00:12:56,234
Huh? About who?

235
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:58,510
Kira? You know. Kira.

236
00:12:58,788 --> 00:13:00,551
I wonder who's going to be killed next.

237
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:08,515
Ryuk, you should check this out.

238
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:09,233
Uh huh.

239
00:13:09,418 --> 00:13:12,585
Websites like this are popping up everywhere lately.

240
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,636
The Legend of Kira the Savior.

241
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,848
Huh. Sounds pretty cool.

242
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:19,132
It's this about you?

243
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:19,870
Yeah.

244
00:13:19,895 --> 00:13:22,810
I think they've taken the name,
Kira, from the English word killer.

245
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:24,713
Can't say I'm too happy about that.

246
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:27,803
But it looks like that's the name they decided to give me.

247
00:13:28,249 --> 00:13:29,601
When I searched the word Kira,

248
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:31,719
I'm pulling up ton of sites just like this one.

249
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:33,671
The media hasn't picked up on it.

250
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:38,459
They're still calling this a succession of unexplained
deaths among the world's most hardened criminals.

251
00:13:38,938 --> 00:13:43,113
But the people of the world can already
sense that there's something happening.

252
00:13:43,277 --> 00:13:46,534
They know there's someone out
there passing righteous judgment.

253
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:48,094
Oh?

254
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:50,813
Human beings are like that, Ryuk.

255
00:13:51,617 --> 00:13:52,453
Oh.

256
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,068
Although this would probably never happen in school,

257
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:59,286
let's say that students were asked to
discuss whether bad people deserve to die.

258
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:03,021
Well, you can bet that everyone would
give the politically correct answer.

259
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:05,463
It's just wrong to kill people.

260
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:08,204
That's what they're bound the say, of course.

261
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:10,344
That's the correct response to give, right?

262
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,746
Humans will always try to maintain
appearances when they're in public.

263
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:15,231
That's just how we are.

264
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,317
But this is how they really feel.

265
00:14:17,585 --> 00:14:21,278
Most are too afraid to support me as
they're worried about what others will think.

266
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:23,533
Many would rather deny my existence.

267
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:26,163
But on the internet, where you can remain anonymous,

268
00:14:26,188 --> 00:14:28,124
support for Kira is growing.

269
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,444
Maybe people are afraid to say it out loud.

270
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,283
But they all understand what's happening.

271
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:35,416
Someone's making the bad guys disappear one by one.

272
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:40,126
Those who have done no wrong are cheering for
Kira in the hearts because they have nothing to fear.

273
00:14:40,168 --> 00:14:42,542
While those who done wrong are on the run.

274
00:14:42,593 --> 00:14:45,397
They're forced to hide from an unknown enemy.

275
00:14:45,604 --> 00:14:47,609
This is how it should be.

276
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:51,182
It's perfect. Everything's going just like I planned.

277
00:14:52,923 --> 00:14:57,271
We'd like to apologize for the
eruption as of now we're bringing you

278
00:14:57,345 --> 00:15:00,505
a live worldwide broadcast from Interpol's ICPO.

279
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,744
Hm. What's this?

280
00:15:03,414 --> 00:15:06,089
We now take you live to the ICPO.

281
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:10,816
I head up an international police task
force which includes all member nations.

282
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,054
I am Lind. L. Tailor.

283
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:15,624
Otherwise known as L.

284
00:15:16,104 --> 00:15:16,893
What?

285
00:15:17,557 --> 00:15:19,011
Who is this guy?

286
00:15:19,138 --> 00:15:20,818
So this is how it all begins.

287
00:15:20,843 --> 00:15:22,123
But sir, I don't get it.

288
00:15:22,148 --> 00:15:24,274
He's never actually shown his face before, right?

289
00:15:24,486 --> 00:15:26,067
Why would he choose to do it now?

290
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:28,419
It must mean L's serious about this.

291
00:15:29,073 --> 00:15:32,233
L, we followed every single one of your orders.

292
00:15:32,325 --> 00:15:35,900
Now it's time for you to prove what you said to the ICPO.

293
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,686
Criminals around the world are
being murdered by a serial killer.

294
00:15:40,711 --> 00:15:44,228
I consider this crime to be the most
atrocious act of murder in history.

295
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:48,499
I will not rest until the person or
persons responsible are brought to justice.

296
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:51,586
Kira, I will hunt you down. I will find you.

297
00:15:51,637 --> 00:15:53,729
He seems certain he'll catch you.

298
00:15:54,151 --> 00:15:55,549
Hm. That fool.

299
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,118
He'll never find me.

300
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,651
He'll have to get this first.

301
00:15:59,684 --> 00:16:03,703
And as long as the police don't find it,
there won't be any evidence to convict me.

302
00:16:03,868 --> 00:16:06,877
Which means that catching me
will be absolutely impossible.

303
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:12,287
I anticipated that the police would get
involved and that something like this might happen.

304
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,557
Kira, I've got a pretty good
idea what your motivation might be.

305
00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:19,003
And I can guess what you hope to achieve.

306
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:22,937
However what you're doing right now is evil.

307
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:23,528
Uh.

308
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,072
You think I'm evil.

309
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,604
I am justice.

310
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:33,139
I protect the innocent and those who fear evil.

311
00:16:33,164 --> 00:16:37,033
I'm the one who become the god of
a new world that everyone desires.

312
00:16:37,058 --> 00:16:40,972
All those who would oppose that god,
they are the ones who are truly evil.

313
00:16:42,095 --> 00:16:45,228
I guess you're just too stupid L. Too bad.

314
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:48,656
This could have been a lot more
interesting if you'd only be a bit smarter.

315
00:17:03,734 --> 00:17:06,694
I'll show the world what happens when you cross me.

316
00:17:07,153 --> 00:17:10,504
The entire world is watching, L.

317
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:16,478
Five more seconds,

318
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:17,582
four,

319
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,570
three,

320
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:19,617
two,

321
00:17:20,144 --> 00:17:20,862
one.

322
00:17:32,973 --> 00:17:35,928
What's wrong? You got nothing else to say?

323
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:39,759
Huh?

324
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,987
I had to test this just in case but I...

325
00:17:44,012 --> 00:17:45,775
I never thought it would actually happen.

326
00:17:46,996 --> 00:17:51,682
Kira, it seems you can kill people
without having to be there in person.

327
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:55,357
I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't just witnesses it.

328
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,610
Listen to me, Kira.

329
00:17:59,338 --> 00:18:03,814
If you did, indeed, kill Lind. L. Tailor,
the man who you just saw die on television,

330
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:08,362
I should tell you that he was an inmate
whose execution was scheduled for today.

331
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:09,547
That was not me.

332
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:10,339
What?

333
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:13,071
The police arrested him in absolute secrecy.

334
00:18:13,103 --> 00:18:16,225
So you wouldn't have heard about
him on TV or through the internet.

335
00:18:16,341 --> 00:18:20,812
It appears that not even you have access to
information about these types of criminals.

336
00:18:21,671 --> 00:18:22,932
Heh, heh.

337
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:24,594
He got you there.

338
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:27,166
But I assure you, L is real.

339
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:29,199
I do exist.

340
00:18:29,354 --> 00:18:31,805
Now try to kill me.

341
00:18:32,192 --> 00:18:34,379
You, you bastard.

342
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,094
What's wrong? Hurry up!

343
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,439
What the hell is going on?

344
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:38,075
He's really taking this too far.

345
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,606
Are you try to kill yourself, L?

346
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:40,646
What going on?

347
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,484
Look, it's Kira versus L.

348
00:18:42,515 --> 00:18:44,476
Live broadcast killing?

349
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:45,894
This is freaky.

350
00:18:45,993 --> 00:18:46,654
Amazing.

351
00:18:46,713 --> 00:18:47,676
Do it Kira.

352
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:48,910
Someone stop this.

353
00:18:48,935 --> 00:18:50,369
Can't you do it?

354
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:57,908
Well, Kira, it seems that you can't kill me after all.

355
00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:01,962
So there are some people you can't kill.

356
00:19:02,582 --> 00:19:04,523
You've given me a useful hint.

357
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:06,235
Let me return the favor.

358
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,159
I'll tell you something that I
think you'll find interesting.

359
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:12,159
Although this was announced as a worldwide broadcast,

360
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,184
the truth is...

361
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:17,282
we are only broadcasting in the Kanto region of Japan.

362
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:22,375
I had planned to broadcast this message
around the world until we found you.

363
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,378
But it looks like that won't be necessary.

364
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:26,215
I now know where you are.

365
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,096
This L guy is pretty good.

366
00:19:29,356 --> 00:19:32,448
The police treated your first
killing as an unrelated incident.

367
00:19:32,473 --> 00:19:36,379
But in actuality, the first of your
victims was a suspect in Shinjuku.

368
00:19:37,185 --> 00:19:40,103
Of all the criminals that recently died of heart attacks,

369
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:43,041
this one's crime was by far the least serious.

370
00:19:43,173 --> 00:19:46,867
Furthermore, his crime was
only ever recorded inside Japan.

371
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:49,955
I used that information to deduce this much.

372
00:19:50,142 --> 00:19:51,416
You are in Japan.

373
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:54,764
And your first victim was little more than an experiment

374
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:57,454
which means that you haven't been killing for very long.

375
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:04,332
We decided to broadcast in Kanto
first because of its large population.

376
00:20:04,357 --> 00:20:06,043
And luckily, we found you.

377
00:20:06,536 --> 00:20:08,383
To be completely honest with you,

378
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,834
I never expected that things would go this well.

379
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:15,095
But it won't be too long now before
I am able to sentence you to death.

380
00:20:15,836 --> 00:20:18,978
L has... certainly lived up to his reputation.

381
00:20:19,003 --> 00:20:19,795
Uh huh.

382
00:20:19,978 --> 00:20:25,326
He proved that Kira exists, that the deaths
were murders, and that he's here in Japan.

383
00:20:25,912 --> 00:20:30,833
Naturally, I'm very interested to know how you're
able to commit these murders without being present.

384
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:36,340
But I don't mind waiting a little bit longer you
can answer all of my questions when I catch you.

385
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:39,334
Let's meet again soon, Kira.

386
00:20:49,866 --> 00:20:50,952
Really?

387
00:20:52,491 --> 00:20:54,687
He's going to sentence me to death.

388
00:20:55,561 --> 00:20:57,165
Sounds interesting.

389
00:20:57,575 --> 00:20:59,600
I accept your challenge, L.

390
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:05,110
Each of them has to hunt down the other
without knowing the other's name or face.

391
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:08,595
And the first one whose identity is revealed will die.

392
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:12,564
Humans are so much fun.

393
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:13,548
L.

394
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:14,626
Kira.

395
00:21:15,202 --> 00:21:18,641
I will hunt you down wherever
you're hiding and I will eliminate you.

396
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,702
I am...

397
00:21:19,727 --> 00:21:20,503
I am...

398
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,286
justice.

399
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:38,990
I'm not the one who's going to find L.

400
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:40,914
I can let the police do that for me.

401
00:22:40,946 --> 00:22:43,851
And when they do, that's when I'll eliminate him.

402
00:22:44,353 --> 00:22:47,602
Looks like I may be able to provide
you with more entertainment, Ryuk.
