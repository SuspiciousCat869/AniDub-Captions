1
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:35,082
Ryuzaki. Please let me go and make the arrest.

2
00:01:35,107 --> 00:01:37,157
I'd like to come with you, Chief, if that's all right.

3
00:01:37,768 --> 00:01:38,838
I understand.

4
00:01:38,887 --> 00:01:40,217
But remember, this is Kira.

5
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,418
Be sure to take every precaution when you
approach him and don't allow him to see your face.

6
00:01:44,763 --> 00:01:45,595
Watari.

7
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,390
If Higuchi tries anything or makes any sudden moves...

8
00:01:48,837 --> 00:01:49,681
Understood.

9
00:01:49,706 --> 00:01:51,810
I will shoot to stop him, not to kill.

10
00:01:59,404 --> 00:02:02,839
Aizawa, do you have a helmet or
something to hide your face with?

11
00:02:02,864 --> 00:02:03,544
I do.

12
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:06,176
Good. Then cover me.

13
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:09,570
Yes sir. You can count on me, Chief.

14
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,994
Higuchi.

15
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:16,501
Put your hands above your head and get out of the car.

16
00:02:29,487 --> 00:02:30,652
We've apprehended him.

17
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,440
Mogi.

18
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:34,843
I want you to put a headset on him as planned.

19
00:02:34,868 --> 00:02:35,699
Roger.

20
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:38,517
Higuchi.

21
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:40,442
How were you able to kill people?

22
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:41,637
Tell me!

23
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:49,231
If you're not going to talk, I'll use
whatever means necessary to get it out of you.

24
00:02:54,145 --> 00:02:55,459
The notebook.

25
00:02:55,746 --> 00:02:56,879
Notebook?

26
00:02:57,055 --> 00:03:00,389
You probably won't believe me,
but I've got a special notebook.

27
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:04,370
If I write someone's name in it while
thinking about of their face, that person dies.

28
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:06,831
A notebook.

29
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:08,207
Mr. Yagami.

30
00:03:08,232 --> 00:03:09,526
Yeah, I found it.

31
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:12,035
It was in one of the compartments of Higuchi's bag.

32
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,928
He has written a lot of names in it, but there
doesn't seem to be anything else unusual about it.

33
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:22,103
What is it, Mr. Yagami?

34
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,506
It's a monster.

35
00:03:24,531 --> 00:03:25,599
Please calm down.

36
00:03:25,793 --> 00:03:26,737
Don't panic.

37
00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:29,037
Remember, you're not currently armed to defend yourself.

38
00:03:29,507 --> 00:03:31,520
Oh. All right. Of course.

39
00:03:31,551 --> 00:03:33,627
Chief. Hang in there. Are you all right?

40
00:03:33,836 --> 00:03:36,503
Mogi, can't you see that thing over there?

41
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:38,938
Chief. I think you must be getting tired.

42
00:03:40,816 --> 00:03:42,528
Mogi. What's wrong?

43
00:03:42,553 --> 00:03:44,494
It... that thing.

44
00:03:44,578 --> 00:03:47,949
It seems only people who have touched the notebook can...

45
00:03:47,974 --> 00:03:50,774
can see this... this monster.

46
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:56,475
Please bring the notebook over to the helicopter.

47
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,286
Uh, oh. OK.

48
00:04:00,903 --> 00:04:04,049
What in the world are you planning to do, Light Yagami?

49
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,935
Once you take hold of that notebook again,

50
00:04:07,022 --> 00:04:09,444
all the memories of the Death Note and what you did

51
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:11,993
while it was yours will return at once.

52
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:14,154
However...

53
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,502
Here it is, Ryuzaki.

54
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:20,656
Hm.

55
00:04:26,358 --> 00:04:29,470
It really is a Shinigami.

56
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:33,271
They really do exist.

57
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,583
Light Yagami...

58
00:04:38,956 --> 00:04:41,311
Ryuzaki, come on. Let me see it.

59
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:44,444
Two books.

60
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,275
There have to be two notebooks.

61
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,555
Possibly more.

62
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,266
This isn't over yet.

63
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:21,327
Uh, are you OK, Light?

64
00:05:21,603 --> 00:05:24,467
I suppose seeing that monster would surprise anyone.

65
00:05:25,556 --> 00:05:26,308
Ryuzaki.

66
00:05:26,795 --> 00:05:27,546
What is it?

67
00:05:28,303 --> 00:05:29,863
I want to check this out.

68
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:33,658
I'm going to try comparing the names written
in this notebook with the names of the victims.

69
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:34,150
Hm?

70
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:35,572
Oh, right.

71
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,724
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.

72
00:05:43,228 --> 00:05:45,128
I've won.

73
00:05:47,282 --> 00:05:49,515
Exactly as planned.

74
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:58,929
I hereby forfeit ownership of this notebook.

75
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,773
Now, that means ownership is
transferred back to you, right?

76
00:06:03,936 --> 00:06:06,379
Yes. I already told you.

77
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:08,767
Next, pass it on to Ryuk.

78
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,114
Hm?

79
00:06:11,426 --> 00:06:13,081
Very well. Here.

80
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:18,468
Now that notebook's ownership has
been transferred from you to Ryuk.

81
00:06:18,851 --> 00:06:19,665
OK, Ryuk.

82
00:06:19,703 --> 00:06:23,197
Take the notebook and drop it on the
ground so it's in the human world again.

83
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:24,225
Huh?

84
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:26,284
Well, OK.

85
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,508
Now the ownership goes back to me.

86
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:33,608
Whoa, hang on.

87
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:35,466
It's just gone around in a circle.

88
00:06:35,491 --> 00:06:36,952
Nothing's changed, right?

89
00:06:37,127 --> 00:06:39,386
Maybe, at first glance.

90
00:06:39,684 --> 00:06:42,651
But there will be a time when I'll benefit from this.

91
00:06:42,712 --> 00:06:45,787
Now, as for this notebook, the one I first received,

92
00:06:46,423 --> 00:06:48,123
I'm gonna give it back to you, Ryuk.

93
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,083
Then you hand it over to Rem.

94
00:06:54,923 --> 00:06:55,656
Here.

95
00:07:00,673 --> 00:07:05,255
Rem, I want you to give the notebook to
someone with status who lusts for power and money.

96
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:08,489
They'll end up using the notebook to satisfy that urge.

97
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,768
If you do that, I can guarantee that Misa
will be released from her confinement soon.

98
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:18,857
And if I'm wrong, and if it looks like she
won't be released for years, then you can kill me.

99
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:20,320
That sound fair to you?

100
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:22,374
Light Yagami.

101
00:07:22,446 --> 00:07:24,120
Just what are you thinking?

102
00:07:24,156 --> 00:07:26,278
Look. This is all to save Misa.

103
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:28,199
You're gonna have to trust me on this.

104
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:32,945
All right.

105
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,767
If it means that Misa will be saved, I'll do as you ask.

106
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:42,189
After this, I'll go and demand to be confined like Misa,

107
00:07:42,403 --> 00:07:45,301
and have them put me under 24 hour surveillance as well.

108
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:49,373
While I'm locked up, I'll relinquish
ownership of the notebook to you.

109
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,688
That'll mean I'll lose all my memories of the Death Note.

110
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,148
During this time, the killings
of criminals will start again.

111
00:07:57,536 --> 00:08:02,302
Once that happens, Ryuzaki will be put
in a position where he has to release us.

112
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:06,203
And, after I've lost all my memories,

113
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:09,002
chances are I'll want to help catch Kira myself.

114
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:11,616
That's just the way I am.

115
00:08:12,656 --> 00:08:18,512
So then you'll try and catch the guy who Rem gives
the notebook to and steal it before L gets to it.

116
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:19,274
Right.

117
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:22,799
Once that's done, I'll kill the new owner of the notebook.

118
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,983
But there's still one problem remaining.

119
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:27,864
If you don't have full ownership,

120
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:31,929
your memories will only return for as
long as you're in contact with the notebook.

121
00:08:32,026 --> 00:08:35,708
As soon as you let go of it,
your memories will disappear again.

122
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:42,228
That means I've got to kill Higuchi
without letting go of this notebook.

123
00:08:42,307 --> 00:08:43,760
If I manage to do that,

124
00:08:43,785 --> 00:08:47,228
ownership will transfer back to
me and my memories won't disappear.

125
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,173
I just have to pull this four times in less than a second.

126
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,744
Got it.

127
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:56,998
Just as I expected.

128
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:58,879
I'm wearing this watch.

129
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:01,029
Old habits die hard.

130
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:15,278
Mr. Yagami. Please take Higuchi to the car.

131
00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:18,793
Uh, right. Of course.

132
00:09:27,337 --> 00:09:29,471
You know, about this notebook.

133
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,949
I wonder what we would find if we
put it through a forensic analysis.

134
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:34,669
That doesn't sound like you, Light.

135
00:09:34,694 --> 00:09:37,310
We both know this thing is beyond science.

136
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,204
Yeah, you're right.

137
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:41,603
Hm.

138
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:56,154
This has got to be the longest 40 seconds of my life.

139
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,497
Hiroguchi! Ryuzaki. Hiroguchi is...

140
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:17,530
What the hell? What's happening?

141
00:10:19,446 --> 00:10:21,189
Hey! Higuchi!

142
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:23,278
Dad, what are you doing?

143
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:24,576
We can't lose him!

144
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:26,286
If Higuchi dies on us now...

145
00:10:26,327 --> 00:10:27,527
It's impossible.

146
00:10:27,737 --> 00:10:30,537
I... There's nothing I can do.

147
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,210
He's already...

148
00:10:34,136 --> 00:10:35,036
Yes.

149
00:10:35,328 --> 00:10:36,993
He's already dead.

150
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:40,289
And you're next, Ryuzaki.

151
00:11:18,294 --> 00:11:19,338
Hm.

152
00:11:20,196 --> 00:11:21,591
How to use it.

153
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,979
It says the human whose name is written in this notebook

154
00:11:26,505 --> 00:11:27,522
shall die.

155
00:11:28,323 --> 00:11:30,923
This note will not take effect unless the writer has

156
00:11:30,948 --> 00:11:34,048
a person's face in their mind
when writing his or her name,

157
00:11:34,124 --> 00:11:37,361
therefore people sharing the
same name will not be affected.

158
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:42,059
If the cause of death is written within
40 seconds of writing the person's name,

159
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:42,988
it will happen.

160
00:11:43,165 --> 00:11:47,476
If the cause of death is not specified,
the person will simply die of a heart attack.

161
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:52,847
After writing the cause of death, details of the death

162
00:11:52,872 --> 00:11:56,419
should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.

163
00:12:00,781 --> 00:12:04,772
As well, the back cover has some
more instructions on how to use it.

164
00:12:04,797 --> 00:12:06,130
There are two more rules.

165
00:12:06,155 --> 00:12:07,174
One of them is

166
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:10,751
if you make this note unusable
by tearing it up or burning it,

167
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,817
all the humans who have touched
the note 'til then will die.

168
00:12:13,853 --> 00:12:16,103
What? Is that really true, Aizawa?

169
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:17,024
Yeah, that's what it says.

170
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:17,849
That's right.

171
00:12:17,874 --> 00:12:21,976
With a rule like that in place,
the notebook's safety is guaranteed,

172
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:24,801
which means my memories of it will remain.

173
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:29,209
Rem, there's no way the old
man back home will get mad at us

174
00:12:29,234 --> 00:12:31,158
if we write fake rules in here, is there?

175
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:34,226
No. There are no rules against doing so.

176
00:12:34,349 --> 00:12:36,049
Fine, then, Light, I'll do it.

177
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:37,982
But you owe me an apple for this.

178
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:41,413
Oh, man.

179
00:12:41,438 --> 00:12:45,178
Maybe I shouldn't have let my curiosity
about seeing a Shinigami get the better of me.

180
00:12:45,524 --> 00:12:48,422
Maybe. But then you would be
the only one in the investigation

181
00:12:48,447 --> 00:12:50,347
who didn't know what we were dealing with.

182
00:12:50,391 --> 00:12:51,426
Is that what you want?

183
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:52,834
No. Of course not.

184
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:55,888
I want to be on the same page as
everyone else on the task force, Chief.

185
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,297
And then there's this last rule.

186
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,630
According to these instructions
at the back of the notebook,

187
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:09,565
if the person using the note fails to consecutively write

188
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,942
names of people to be killed within 13 days of each other,

189
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:15,361
then the user will die.

190
00:13:17,982 --> 00:13:19,411
Ah! Wait a second.

191
00:13:20,124 --> 00:13:23,881
If that's true, then it means Light and
Misa Misa are completely clear, doesn't it?

192
00:13:23,924 --> 00:13:26,519
Hm. Yeah. Now that you mention it, that's right.

193
00:13:26,657 --> 00:13:30,641
Light and Misa were detained for more than
50 days, and are still under surveillance.

194
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:32,342
If either of them had been Kira,

195
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:34,367
there's no way they would still be alive by now.

196
00:13:34,392 --> 00:13:36,251
Wow, that's great news. Isn't it, Chief?

197
00:13:36,276 --> 00:13:37,092
Yeah.

198
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:39,507
Rem, was it?

199
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:41,911
That's your name, isn't it? The white thing over there?

200
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:45,549
Ryuzaki, isn't it a bit rude to go
around calling someone a white thing?

201
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,657
What do you want?

202
00:13:47,307 --> 00:13:50,232
There's more than one notebook
in the human world, isn't there?

203
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:53,701
Who knows?

204
00:13:53,748 --> 00:13:55,718
There may be, and there may not be.

205
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,228
If there are other notebooks,
either here or in your world,

206
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:02,453
would they all have the same rules as this one?

207
00:14:02,478 --> 00:14:04,545
You're wasting your time, Ryuzaki.

208
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,370
You'll never get Rem to admit these rules are fake.

209
00:14:07,395 --> 00:14:09,449
Yes, they are all the same.

210
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,257
There are many notebooks in the Shinigami realm,

211
00:14:12,282 --> 00:14:14,382
but they all have the same rules.

212
00:14:14,407 --> 00:14:17,009
Even the rules for when humans obtain them.

213
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,469
Ryuzaki.

214
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:21,467
Miss Amane and Light have both been cleared of suspicion.

215
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:23,651
They shouldn't be under surveillance any longer.

216
00:14:23,857 --> 00:14:25,817
That's right. It's crystal clear.

217
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:30,024
I suppose you're right.

218
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,794
I understand.

219
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,703
Please, accept my apologies for all the trouble.

220
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:50,290
Thank goodness.

221
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:52,990
Yeah, but we still can't say that

222
00:14:53,015 --> 00:14:55,324
we've solved the case until we've figured out everything.

223
00:14:55,447 --> 00:14:57,681
Would it be all right if I kept investigating with you?

224
00:14:57,706 --> 00:14:59,065
Without the handcuffs on?

225
00:14:59,658 --> 00:15:00,305
Yes.

226
00:15:02,173 --> 00:15:06,128
And just like that, Misa and I are proven innocent.

227
00:15:06,153 --> 00:15:10,026
A notebook of death filled
with rules written by a Shinigami.

228
00:15:10,051 --> 00:15:12,626
He has no choice but to believe it.

229
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:16,847
He just lost his edge, thanks to the fake rules I created.

230
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,363
Listen, Ryuzaki,

231
00:15:20,697 --> 00:15:24,313
no matter what the word, the god
of that world creates the rules.

232
00:15:24,338 --> 00:15:28,063
In truth, you've already been
defeated by the rules I created.

233
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:31,184
And as punishment for defying the god of the new world,

234
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:32,953
you will die.

235
00:15:37,071 --> 00:15:38,256
Oh, Light!

236
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:40,726
Be sure to text me every day, OK?

237
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:43,849
After all this time, we're saying goodbye to Misa Misa.

238
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:45,188
Knock it off, Matsuda.

239
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:46,703
Let's leave them alone.

240
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,234
Goodbye, Misa Misa!

241
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,051
Enough!

242
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:53,330
Good.

243
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:54,699
There are surveillance cameras,

244
00:15:54,724 --> 00:15:57,761
but they won't be able to pick up
my face or mouth from this angle.

245
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:00,917
Misa, I'm going to tell you about a special place.

246
00:16:00,942 --> 00:16:05,226
I need you to go there and dig something up,
but you have to make sure that no one is watching.

247
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:08,130
Light! Your memory must have returned.

248
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:10,092
Don't worry, I can do this.

249
00:16:10,117 --> 00:16:11,517
I won't let you down.

250
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:33,303
Light, I remember.

251
00:16:33,328 --> 00:16:36,587
I remember everything that
happened when I had this notebook.

252
00:16:36,682 --> 00:16:40,889
You buried this one so I could
come here and regain my memories.

253
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:43,689
Huh?

254
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:48,848
Dear Misa, by the time you read this letter,

255
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:50,916
you should have remembered everything.

256
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:53,903
Oh, a letter from Light!

257
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:58,166
Do you remember my friend at To-Oh University?

258
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:00,780
He went by the name Hideki Ryuga.

259
00:17:01,532 --> 00:17:03,964
I want you to write his real name in the notebook

260
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:05,234
and kill him.

261
00:17:05,573 --> 00:17:07,620
Then burn this letter right away.

262
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:10,831
Take a number of pages from the notebook

263
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:12,656
and rebury it where you found it.

264
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:14,807
The next time that we see each other,

265
00:17:14,832 --> 00:17:17,233
casually touch me with a piece of the notebook.

266
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:21,665
If you do this for me, I promise I will love you.

267
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,289
For the rest of my life!

268
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,420
Yay!

269
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:28,198
Now I see. This was all part of Light's plan.

270
00:17:28,223 --> 00:17:30,143
He wanted me to get this notebook,

271
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:34,491
regain all my memories, and then kill Hideki Ryuga.

272
00:17:34,563 --> 00:17:36,246
Kill Ryuzaki.

273
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:39,597
One of Light's biggest obstacles will be gone,

274
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,930
and I'll be helpful to him at last!

275
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:46,757
But Light, it's no good.

276
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:49,657
I don't remember his name anymore.

277
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:55,385
I was seeing dozens no, no, hundreds
of names and lifespans every day!

278
00:17:56,882 --> 00:17:57,815
Oh!

279
00:17:57,873 --> 00:17:59,903
I can't remember it, no matter what!

280
00:18:00,032 --> 00:18:01,903
Oh, I'm such an idiot!

281
00:18:02,157 --> 00:18:03,036
Huh?

282
00:18:04,493 --> 00:18:06,802
I've finally returned to the human world.

283
00:18:07,288 --> 00:18:08,221
Ryuk!

284
00:18:08,265 --> 00:18:09,786
Oh, it's been so long!

285
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:11,324
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

286
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:12,004
How are you doing?

287
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:12,906
Sorry...

288
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:16,935
I'm a guy.

289
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:19,586
I get a little shy sometimes.

290
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:21,565
Oh, yeah. I almost forgot.

291
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:22,396
Here.

292
00:18:23,306 --> 00:18:25,091
Light told me to bring one for you.

293
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,309
Is it really that good?

294
00:18:29,432 --> 00:18:30,332
Oh, yeah.

295
00:18:30,357 --> 00:18:32,170
Human apples are, what's the word?

296
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,478
Juicy, I think. They're great, anyway.

297
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,689
Why don't you try this?

298
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,639
Huh?

299
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:42,566
An apple from the Shinigami world.

300
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:46,045
Ew. It doesn't look very good.

301
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,064
Come on. One bite won't kill ya.

302
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:53,776
By the way, before I forget, I
want you to make the eye deal with me.

303
00:18:56,316 --> 00:18:57,241
Ah!

304
00:18:58,591 --> 00:18:59,824
It's sand!

305
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,963
Ugh.

306
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:06,434
A deal, huh?

307
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,520
Mm... hm.

308
00:19:08,506 --> 00:19:10,586
You understand what that means?

309
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:13,777
You already made the same deal with Rem once before.

310
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,495
Are you sure you really want
me to cut your lifespan in half

311
00:19:17,543 --> 00:19:18,838
for the second time?

312
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,941
I know, but what choice do I have?

313
00:19:22,436 --> 00:19:26,464
You see, I've forgotten a name
that I absolutely have to remember.

314
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:29,482
Light will be so mad at me if I let him down.

315
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:33,425
Well, it's fine with me.

316
00:19:39,941 --> 00:19:41,405
Hey, it's Misa Misa.

317
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:42,788
The poor girl.

318
00:19:42,813 --> 00:19:45,342
As long as we're stuck in here,
we can't turn our cell phones on.

319
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:48,236
So she has to come all the way
out here just to hang out with Light.

320
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,407
Light, would you hurry up and go see her?

321
00:19:51,432 --> 00:19:53,994
Don't you know, you should never keep a woman waiting?

322
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:56,009
OK.

323
00:19:59,265 --> 00:19:59,822
Huh?

324
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:01,092
Ryuk?

325
00:20:01,883 --> 00:20:03,800
Why is he attached to Misa?

326
00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:05,754
Huh?

327
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:09,608
Misa's lifespan.

328
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:11,247
It's been halved again.

329
00:20:11,615 --> 00:20:12,419
No!

330
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:14,807
Did she make the eye deal with Ryuk?

331
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,340
Hey, Light.

332
00:20:24,065 --> 00:20:25,688
It's been a while, Ryuk.

333
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:32,490
Light, I'm so sorry.

334
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:34,692
I don't remember Hideki Ryuga's real name.

335
00:20:34,717 --> 00:20:36,934
I tried, but I totally forgot.

336
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:38,066
Oh, I see.

337
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:39,799
Well, that's too bad.

338
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,113
But I did the eye deal with Ryuk so I can try again!

339
00:20:43,138 --> 00:20:45,440
So, everything's going according to plan.

340
00:20:45,465 --> 00:20:46,169
You idiot!

341
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:48,132
If you do that, then your lifespan will...

342
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:49,692
No, it's all right.

343
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,959
I just wanna be of use to you, Light.

344
00:20:56,266 --> 00:20:57,094
Misa.

345
00:20:57,365 --> 00:21:01,301
All I want is to enjoy a long
life with you in an ideal world.

346
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:02,732
That's just how I feel.

347
00:21:02,866 --> 00:21:04,840
Light, I'm so happy.

348
00:21:05,427 --> 00:21:07,590
Let's create a new world together.

349
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:12,090
It'll be a place with no crime,
where only kind people live, OK?

350
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:13,031
Yeah.

351
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:50,506
Goodbye!
