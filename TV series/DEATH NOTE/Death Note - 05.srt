1
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:47,340
You there.

2
00:01:47,664 --> 00:01:48,182
Yeah?

3
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:49,359
Listen carefully.

4
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:51,739
I cam to Japan as part of a secret investigation,

5
00:01:51,764 --> 00:01:55,496
so the local police can't find out that, um, that I...

6
00:01:56,795 --> 00:01:57,962
I understand.

7
00:01:58,122 --> 00:02:02,855
I promise I won't tell anyone that I met
you, and of course that includes my father.

8
00:02:03,572 --> 00:02:05,418
Well, then please excuse me.

9
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,944
It's just as I thought.

10
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:12,679
Anyway, I don't want the police to know

11
00:02:12,704 --> 00:02:15,653
that I've come into contact with an FBI agent either.

12
00:02:15,982 --> 00:02:17,731
If my father ever found out,

13
00:02:17,797 --> 00:02:19,665
there's no doubt he'd let L know.

14
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,355
It's obvious that he doesn't suspect me.

15
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:28,583
And as for the police, I'm sure they'll
treat this as just another unfortunate accident.

16
00:02:42,668 --> 00:02:44,012
Hey, welcome back.

17
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,866
What a day.

18
00:02:47,954 --> 00:02:49,321
Raye, what's the matter?

19
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:50,913
Something happened, didn't it?

20
00:02:51,044 --> 00:02:52,993
I've never heard you sigh like that.

21
00:02:53,614 --> 00:02:54,420
Yeah.

22
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:57,605
The bus I was on got hijacked, if you can believe it.

23
00:02:57,807 --> 00:02:59,234
A busjacking?

24
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,255
Some junkie robbed a bank two days ago and I
guess he wanted to try taking on a bus today.

25
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:06,965
I didn't think this kind of thing happened here.

26
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:11,070
So you were already riding the
bus when the hijacker got on?

27
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,970
Yeah.

28
00:03:12,695 --> 00:03:16,553
And in the end, the guy freaked out,
jumped off the bus, and got hit by a car.

29
00:03:17,928 --> 00:03:18,835
Did he die?

30
00:03:20,632 --> 00:03:22,069
Yeah, probably.

31
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:24,655
I couldn't really stick around
to see what happened to him.

32
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,613
You know

33
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:26,466
Hm?

34
00:03:26,502 --> 00:03:29,515
It's a little hard to believe that that
was all a coincidence, don't you think?

35
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:31,167
What do you mean?

36
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:32,231
Think about it.

37
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:34,779
You got on that bus because you
were investigating someone, right?

38
00:03:34,903 --> 00:03:37,824
And now you're telling me that
this criminal is most likely dead.

39
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:39,564
Doesn't that suggest that you...

40
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:40,205
That's enough.

41
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:40,627
Uh.

42
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:44,991
Look, darling, you and I know you used
to be one of the best agents in the FBI.

43
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:46,593
But now you're my fiance now.

44
00:03:46,618 --> 00:03:47,932
We talked about this.

45
00:03:48,203 --> 00:03:51,165
You're not an agent anymore, so just leave it alone.

46
00:03:51,555 --> 00:03:52,006
But...

47
00:03:53,384 --> 00:03:57,910
You wouldn't get involved with the Kira
case and you wouldn't do anything dangerous.

48
00:03:57,935 --> 00:04:02,426
That's what you promised when we decided you'd
come with me so I could meet your parents in Japan.

49
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,085
You do remember that, don't you?

50
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,723
Yeah, I guess you're right.

51
00:04:05,976 --> 00:04:07,409
It's just force of habit.

52
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:08,609
Sorry about that.

53
00:04:09,128 --> 00:04:11,037
No, I should be sorry.

54
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:12,430
Let's forget about it.

55
00:04:12,747 --> 00:04:15,092
Anyway, once we have a few kids running around,

56
00:04:15,117 --> 00:04:18,095
you'll probably be so busy you'll
forget you were ever an agent.

57
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:20,777
Your mind'll be occupied with better things, too.

58
00:04:22,258 --> 00:04:25,882
More importantly, tell me how I can
convince your dad I'm worthy of his daughter.

59
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:28,183
Kira doesn't scare me half as much as he does.

60
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:32,189
Oh, let me guess.

61
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:35,096
You're about to write down the
name of that agent, aren't you?

62
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:36,247
The one from the bus.

63
00:04:36,272 --> 00:04:37,114
Not yet.

64
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:39,901
I'm going to wait one week before writing his name.

65
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:41,930
If he dies right after meeting me,

66
00:04:41,955 --> 00:04:43,821
I'll only draw attention to myself.

67
00:04:43,846 --> 00:04:48,287
I'll write his name in here once I've given them
time to investigate more people with ties to the police.

68
00:04:48,312 --> 00:04:49,979
It will be less obvious that way.

69
00:04:50,017 --> 00:04:53,357
In the meantime, I think I'll use some
of those inmates I've been keeping alive

70
00:04:53,382 --> 00:04:55,504
to play around with L a little more.

71
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:57,599
L.

72
00:04:57,624 --> 00:04:58,179
Hm?

73
00:04:58,951 --> 00:04:59,996
Another victim.

74
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:02,855
This one left what appears to be a suicide note.

75
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:04,990
Please, send it to me.

76
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:09,954
Gods of death.

77
00:05:10,195 --> 00:05:11,802
L, do you know?

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,719
Gods of death.

79
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:18,324
Is he trying to tell us that gods of death exist?

80
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,504
Listen, Watari, tell the police
to monitor prison populations

81
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:24,202
closely for the next few days.

82
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,258
Kira may use other suicide notes to communicate with us.

83
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:29,577
Understood.

84
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:41,088
This place is crawling with humans.

85
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,048
Are you gonna do it here?

86
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,800
Let's just say you're about to see

87
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:46,880
the results of all the research and experiments

88
00:05:46,905 --> 00:05:48,802
I've been doing over the last few days.

89
00:05:48,856 --> 00:05:49,902
Experiments?

90
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:50,782
Yeah.

91
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,435
I've been using known criminals
who live in this part of town

92
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,149
to test out different killing methods,

93
00:05:55,174 --> 00:05:57,246
and I've learned a lot about the Death note.

94
00:05:57,726 --> 00:06:00,368
For example, if I write a cause of death

95
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,159
and the circumstances leading up to it,

96
00:06:02,203 --> 00:06:04,836
I can add a name afterwards and it'll still happen.

97
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,248
Oooh.

98
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,265
Even I didn't know that one.

99
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:09,947
He's here.

100
00:06:11,298 --> 00:06:12,476
Right on time.

101
00:06:17,392 --> 00:06:18,902
Mr. Raye Pember.

102
00:06:20,051 --> 00:06:21,950
Turn around and you're dead.

103
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:23,860
I am Kira.

104
00:06:26,973 --> 00:06:27,700
That's right.

105
00:06:27,725 --> 00:06:29,817
Don't turn around or put your hands in your pockets.

106
00:06:29,842 --> 00:06:31,951
I won't hesitate to kill you here.

107
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:34,344
It... it couldn't be.

108
00:06:34,523 --> 00:06:36,981
His voice, I've heard it somewhere.

109
00:06:37,337 --> 00:06:40,076
But first I'm gonna prove to you that I'm Kira.

110
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:43,237
Do you see the man working over there at the coffee shop?

111
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:46,079
That's right, the one sweeping the floor.

112
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:47,808
I'm gonna kill him just for you.

113
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:49,303
But but how?

114
00:06:49,553 --> 00:06:50,388
Don't do it.

115
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:58,445
I'm afraid I had no choice but to kill him.

116
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,959
I figured if I didn't kill at least
one person, you wouldn't believe him.

117
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:05,383
Although that man has been
repeatedly charged with sexual assault,

118
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:09,171
he's managed to avoid conviction
every time due to lack of evidence.

119
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,024
He was a menace to society.

120
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,790
He got what he deserved.

121
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:16,515
I can only assume that L has already informed you of this.

122
00:07:16,573 --> 00:07:18,720
I can't kill someone who I haven't seen.

123
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:20,322
I have to know their face.

124
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:25,345
Which means, of course, I could easily
kill all these people right now if I wanted to.

125
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,425
Go ahead and choose someone if you want.

126
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,348
Ddon't do it.

127
00:07:28,373 --> 00:07:29,137
I believe you.

128
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:30,553
You're Kira.

129
00:07:32,123 --> 00:07:34,423
But I'm sure you care more about your loved ones

130
00:07:34,448 --> 00:07:35,715
than any of these people here.

131
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,281
Imagine how you'd feel if one of them was
killed just because you refused to cooperate.

132
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,492
I think you should consider them
the real hostages at the moment.

133
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:46,544
How do you know about her?

134
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:49,860
You seem surprised.

135
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:52,216
I've been investigating you.

136
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:55,908
And if you don't do exactly as I say, she will die,

137
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:59,378
and so will the rest of your family, including you.

138
00:07:59,403 --> 00:08:01,010
And that's a promise.

139
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:02,629
I... I understand.

140
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:04,378
Just tell me what you need me to do.

141
00:08:04,403 --> 00:08:06,747
I see you've got your laptop with you.

142
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:11,796
I want the files containing the identities
of all the FBI agents who came to Japan.

143
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:14,055
I do have my laptop with me.

144
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,478
It's the one I use for work.

145
00:08:15,503 --> 00:08:17,711
But I don't have the files you're looking for.

146
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:20,571
All right, then take this envelope.

147
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:21,272
Huh?

148
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:25,176
First, take the transceiver out of the envelope.

149
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:28,316
Then put the earpiece in and await my instructions.

150
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,920
The transceiver?

151
00:08:30,124 --> 00:08:31,676
This thing looks like a toy.

152
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:34,882
But there'll be no record of this transmission anywhere.

153
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:38,768
And it allows us to converse from
a close distance, even underground.

154
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:40,597
He really thought this through.

155
00:08:41,739 --> 00:08:44,489
All right, now get on the Yamanote Line.

156
00:08:44,564 --> 00:08:46,011
Inner or outer route,

157
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:48,330
it doesn't matter which direction you take.

158
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:55,681
I'll be close by at all times, which
means I'll be watching your every move.

159
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:59,868
When you get on the train, pick a spot in
front of you and don't take your eyes off it.

160
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:02,405
If I see you looking around, I will kill you.

161
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:06,109
Once you've boarded, I want you to
take the seat closest to the door.

162
00:09:06,197 --> 00:09:08,819
If it's occupied, wait until it's free.

163
00:09:25,323 --> 00:09:27,646
Now I'm going to ask you something.

164
00:09:27,671 --> 00:09:31,123
If I have even the slightest
suspicion that you're not being honest,

165
00:09:31,148 --> 00:09:33,204
your girlfriend is as good as dead.

166
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,712
How many FBI agents are currently in Japan?

167
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:40,026
Speak quietly into the transceiver
and don't make it obvious.

168
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:44,339
I believe it's four teams, three
agents per team, for a total of 12.

169
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:45,595
OK.

170
00:09:45,742 --> 00:09:48,003
Now take the papers out of the envelope.

171
00:09:50,116 --> 00:09:50,802
Huh?

172
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,978
What is this?

173
00:09:56,915 --> 00:09:58,986
Of those 12 agents you mentioned,

174
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:01,373
I want you to write down the name of your superior,

175
00:10:01,398 --> 00:10:03,289
the one who's heading up this investigation,

176
00:10:03,314 --> 00:10:05,529
in the space at the very top of the page.

177
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:08,249
What is the meaning of this?

178
00:10:08,427 --> 00:10:09,735
What is he after?

179
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:12,258
Let's face it he hasn't really left me any choice.

180
00:10:12,515 --> 00:10:15,962
Besides, it's not like he can
kill them using just their names.

181
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,875
Next, take out your laptop and turn it on.

182
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,724
Any minute now, your boss is going to
send you a message with a file attachment.

183
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:27,703
It contains the names and photos of all
the FBI agents currently active in Japan.

184
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:29,848
But this... this is...

185
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:34,179
Now one by one, you're going to look at each photo

186
00:10:34,204 --> 00:10:36,843
and then write that agent's name in the space provided.

187
00:10:36,868 --> 00:10:39,089
You're going to do this for each agent.

188
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:41,968
It doesn't make sense.

189
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:44,995
If he's got the names already, why use me?

190
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:47,470
What's he planning to do with them?

191
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:52,677
Good. Looks like you're done.

192
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:54,584
Now put the transceiver and all the papers

193
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:58,878
back into the original envelope and place
them on the rack directly above your head.

194
00:10:59,015 --> 00:11:03,567
After that, you're going to stay in your seat
and ride the train for at least another 30 minutes.

195
00:11:03,592 --> 00:11:07,606
When you are absolutely certain that nobody
will notice you leaving without the envelope,

196
00:11:07,631 --> 00:11:09,130
you can get off the train.

197
00:11:13,421 --> 00:11:15,171
I know that voice.

198
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:18,792
Why on earth can't I remember who it belongs to?

199
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:29,848
Kira, who are you?

200
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:51,436
Light Yagami.

201
00:11:52,807 --> 00:11:55,431
Farewell, Raye Pember.

202
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:07,091
Raye Pember wrote all of those names
on pages taken from the Death Note.

203
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:08,270
Ironic.

204
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:13,122
Without even realizing it, he was actually
signing a death warrant for all of his colleagues.

205
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:18,483
As for Pember's boss, he died of a heart
attack after sending all his agents a file.

206
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:20,909
And the other 11 investigators?

207
00:12:21,346 --> 00:12:25,302
They all died of heart attacks
after receiving the same file.

208
00:12:37,982 --> 00:12:41,186
L, you have a call from the director of the FBI.

209
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,415
It's me.

210
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:49,769
I've got a report in front of me right now
stating that all of our agents in Japan are dead.

211
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,559
All 12 died of heart attacks.

212
00:12:52,636 --> 00:12:55,460
I can only assume that Kira is behind this.

213
00:12:56,135 --> 00:12:59,633
Look, I'm sorry, but it's already decided.

214
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:01,762
We're calling off our investigation.

215
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,906
I have Chief Yagami on the line.

216
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:09,532
L, I just got off the phone with the director of the FBI.

217
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:14,339
According to him, it seems that you
arranged for the FBI to come to Japan

218
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:17,898
and investigate everyone here
associated with the task force.

219
00:13:18,373 --> 00:13:19,640
Yes, I did.

220
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:21,325
So how do you explain this?

221
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:24,155
Are we now suspects in our own investigation?

222
00:13:24,592 --> 00:13:28,383
I felt that it was necessary to uncover Kira's identity.

223
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,150
I cannot accept that!

224
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:32,686
I find it unbelievable that you would spy on us,

225
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:35,258
the very people working with you on this case.

226
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:36,530
Hear that?

227
00:13:36,602 --> 00:13:38,864
Well, I knew all along we couldn't trust that guy.

228
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:42,335
More importantly, Kira killed those FBI agents, didn't he?

229
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:44,866
It's obvious he'll kill anyone who gets in his way,

230
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,345
whether they're criminals or not.

231
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:48,478
So much for his sense of justice.

232
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:49,712
He's a murderer.

233
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:52,717
We have another victim.

234
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:54,995
A note was found at the scene.

235
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:00,828
L, do you know gods of death...

236
00:14:01,877 --> 00:14:02,781
Hum?

237
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,059
Love apples.

238
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:08,605
Damn you, Kira.

239
00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:15,580
He's dead?

240
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,359
Raye's dead?

241
00:14:18,113 --> 00:14:21,868
No, he was... he was murdered by Kira.

242
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,268
Um, so what's with the family meeting, Dad?

243
00:14:29,814 --> 00:14:32,614
I figured you're going to find out sooner or later,

244
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:34,514
so I might as well tell you now.

245
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,346
I don't want you to be alarmed.

246
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:38,660
I'm sure you've heard of this Kira investigation.

247
00:14:38,685 --> 00:14:40,459
Well, I'm currently in charge of it.

248
00:14:40,484 --> 00:14:42,026
What? Are you serious?

249
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:43,633
That's totally awesome, Dad.

250
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:45,224
You're the best cop ever!

251
00:14:45,295 --> 00:14:47,661
That's not quite the point I'm trying to make.

252
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:48,261
Oh?

253
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:54,145
You see, the truth is the FBI
sent 12 of their agents to Japan

254
00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:56,164
to assist us in finding Kira,

255
00:14:56,253 --> 00:14:58,154
and all of them died yesterday.

256
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:00,537
Does that mean they were all killed by Kira?

257
00:15:00,562 --> 00:15:01,363
What?

258
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:04,423
What I'm saying is there's a
chance that Kira will actually

259
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:06,515
try to kill anyone who comes after him.

260
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,033
His crimes are ruthless and more
frightening than anything we've seen.

261
00:15:10,058 --> 00:15:11,908
Many detectives have already quit.

262
00:15:12,313 --> 00:15:13,946
Dad, you should quit, too.

263
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:15,226
I don't want you to die.

264
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:16,686
What if he gets you?

265
00:15:16,711 --> 00:15:17,750
That's right.

266
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:20,153
Your life is so much more important than some job.

267
00:15:20,178 --> 00:15:20,957
I can't.

268
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,958
I could never forgive myself if I walked away from this.

269
00:15:23,983 --> 00:15:26,297
I will not sit back and let evil triumph.

270
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:28,506
But Dad, you...

271
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:29,732
Please, dear.

272
00:15:31,332 --> 00:15:33,665
I think it's honorable of you, Dad.

273
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,277
I'm proud to be able to call you my father.

274
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:38,816
And if anything should ever happen to you,

275
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,977
I'm going to find Kira and make sure he gets executed.

276
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:51,290
We now know that Kira doesn't just target criminals.

277
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:53,049
He'll kill anyone who opposes him.

278
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:56,295
It's quite possible that we may all be killed by Kira.

279
00:15:57,087 --> 00:16:02,086
Think of your own lives, your families
and all the others you'd be leaving behind.

280
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:06,206
If anyone wants to leave this
investigation, now is the time.

281
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,728
You won't be demoted if you choose not to stay.

282
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:10,224
You have my word.

283
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:14,543
But if you're not absolutely sure, then we don't need you.

284
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:19,361
You have to be willing to fight against him,
even if that means making the ultimate sacrifice.

285
00:16:20,028 --> 00:16:21,254
That is all.

286
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:23,880
So what are you gonna do?

287
00:16:23,905 --> 00:16:25,322
I'm not sure.

288
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,580
Oh, yeah, that's him all right.

289
00:16:27,607 --> 00:16:28,894
There's no doubt about it.

290
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:31,268
I remember him because he told us to get down.

291
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:34,363
But I don't really remember any of the other passengers.

292
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,938
I see.

293
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:38,810
Well, thanks for talking with me anyway.

294
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:39,681
I appreciate it.

295
00:16:43,332 --> 00:16:44,903
It's a bit of a long shot,

296
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,756
but if what I'm thinking is right,

297
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:49,894
Kira could have been one of the
passengers on the bus that day.

298
00:16:50,238 --> 00:16:54,927
And if that is the case, then I know
that he's close enough to use this bus route.

299
00:17:03,183 --> 00:17:04,588
Five men, huh?

300
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:07,017
Well, six, including myself.

301
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:12,674
Still, I'm grateful to see that there are as many as
five of you willing to risk your lives to face evil.

302
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,551
The fact that you've chosen to stay
means you have a strong sense of justice.

303
00:17:16,576 --> 00:17:17,699
I trust all of you.

304
00:17:17,724 --> 00:17:18,462
Huh?

305
00:17:18,928 --> 00:17:20,994
Uh, hold on a second.

306
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,752
L just said that he's decided to trust us now.

307
00:17:23,854 --> 00:17:26,730
But honestly, what reason do we have to trust him?

308
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:31,890
Look, L, all of us have agreed to put
our lives at risk to bring Kira to justice,

309
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,145
so I hope you understand what this means.

310
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,146
We're really sticking our necks out here.

311
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:38,671
But you never have to show your face, do you?

312
00:17:38,696 --> 00:17:40,328
You just give the orders.

313
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:44,566
I don't see how you can expect us to
work alongside you under those conditions.

314
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:51,906
L, if all of us are going to
work together on this investigation,

315
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:55,353
and if you truly meant what you
said about trusting the six of us,

316
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:58,232
could you come here so we can all meet in person?

317
00:18:00,551 --> 00:18:02,677
The thought had already crossed my mind.

318
00:18:02,702 --> 00:18:05,287
After all, I did say that I trusted all of you.

319
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:11,899
Huh?

320
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:31,210
Why is he seeking our help now?

321
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,635
There's only six of us.

322
00:18:32,693 --> 00:18:37,463
He solved all these difficult cases by himself
in the past, so what makes this one so different?

323
00:18:37,488 --> 00:18:39,604
The way L's been conducting things so far,

324
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:41,581
odds are he's going to send a standin

325
00:18:41,606 --> 00:18:44,467
or a proxy of some kind to
meet us instead of coming himself.

326
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,248
It's not like we'd ever know.

327
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,843
A proxy, huh?

328
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,580
Well, it is possible.

329
00:18:49,605 --> 00:18:51,907
I believe L. I think we can trust him.

330
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:56,303
And besides, I don't really see how
we can solve this case without his help.

331
00:18:56,713 --> 00:18:57,733
I agree.

332
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,775
From the beginning, he's been very upfront about the fact
that he would need the help of the police on this case.

333
00:19:05,147 --> 00:19:07,397
Perhaps we should think of it like...

334
00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:10,629
he's been waiting for this to happen all along.

335
00:19:11,221 --> 00:19:13,017
Why would he do something like that?

336
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:18,150
There were a number of people on the task force
who distrusted L before this investigation began.

337
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:21,789
And once we got started, we had
detectives resigning left and right.

338
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,973
Following that, classified information was leaked,

339
00:19:25,028 --> 00:19:27,425
so I'm not surprised that he didn't trust us.

340
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:32,378
In other words, he was waiting for the task force to get
narrowed down to only those investigators he could trust.

341
00:19:32,403 --> 00:19:36,400
And to do that, he needed to weed
out anyone who wasn't totally committed.

342
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,564
Hm.

343
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:42,365
If we're working with that guy I'm leaving the task force.

344
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,433
You don't have to worry.

345
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,773
I won't try to follow you.

346
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:46,609
I'm not interested in finding L.

347
00:19:49,953 --> 00:19:54,171
Well, I think we can trust L, so I'd be willing
to cooperate with him on this investigation.

348
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,468
Count me in.

349
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,835
I'm staying in a suite at the Teito Hotel at the moment,

350
00:20:03,008 --> 00:20:06,669
but I'll be switching hotels
every few days from this point on.

351
00:20:06,742 --> 00:20:11,598
I want you to think of these hotel rooms as
the de facto headquarters of this investigation.

352
00:20:11,623 --> 00:20:17,285
If this arrangement is acceptable to all of you,
then split into two groups and stagger your arrivals

353
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,651
so you come 30 minutes apart.

354
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:23,262
Please arrange it, so you're all here at midnight.

355
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:27,517
Kira.

356
00:20:27,753 --> 00:20:30,705
It seems we're getting closer
to each other in equal steps.

357
00:20:31,283 --> 00:20:34,104
It's only a matter of time before we collide.

358
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:35,745
So be it.

359
00:20:36,138 --> 00:20:37,954
I'm ready to show my face.

360
00:20:38,368 --> 00:20:41,249
I'll make my first public appearance as L.

361
00:20:41,427 --> 00:20:44,413
If you ever manage to find
out about these secret meetings,

362
00:20:44,438 --> 00:20:47,451
I'm sure you'd feel compelled to move in.

363
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:49,705
That's what I'm counting on.

364
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:54,877
I've been quite active over these last few days.

365
00:20:55,072 --> 00:20:56,256
Think carefully.

366
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:57,678
Was there anything I missed?

367
00:20:58,001 --> 00:20:59,534
And what comes next?

368
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,055
There are endless possibilities.

369
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:06,612
The real battle is only just beginning, L.

370
00:21:14,894 --> 00:21:15,999
It's unlocked.

371
00:21:16,086 --> 00:21:18,048
Please let yourselves in.

372
00:21:18,073 --> 00:21:18,859
Mm.

373
00:22:38,451 --> 00:22:39,559
This woman,

374
00:22:39,707 --> 00:22:42,548
If she had spoken to the police before I met her

375
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:46,178
but it seems there's a god on my side after all,

376
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:48,729
and not just a god of death.
