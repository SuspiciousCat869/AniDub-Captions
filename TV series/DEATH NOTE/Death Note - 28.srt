1
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:32,856
Wow, it's been a long time.

2
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:35,375
Thank you for always taking such good care of my father.

3
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,059
Gee, Sayu.

4
00:01:37,412 --> 00:01:39,127
You're all grown up.

5
00:01:39,152 --> 00:01:40,109
This is Yagami.

6
00:01:40,306 --> 00:01:43,337
Look. About trading the director
in exchange for the notebook.

7
00:01:43,462 --> 00:01:44,670
It's been cancelled.

8
00:01:45,423 --> 00:01:46,456
The new deal is this.

9
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,711
The notebook for Sayu Yagami.

10
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:54,077
Come to LA, by yourself, in two
days, and bring the notebook with you.

11
00:01:54,102 --> 00:01:56,896
I'm pleased to meet you at last, L number two.

12
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:01,051
I am at the center of the SPK.

13
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,081
You can address me as N.

14
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:05,821
N?

15
00:02:06,257 --> 00:02:07,433
Who is this guys?

16
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,880
Is he joking?

17
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:11,712
But this strange feeling.

18
00:02:12,353 --> 00:02:13,191
What is it?

19
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:22,564
N. Why do I feel like I'm talking to L?

20
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:25,476
I told you that we wouldn't rely on L,

21
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,332
but that's a bit of an understatement.

22
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:31,484
The FBI and the CIA have explicitly
asked that I head up their investigation.

23
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:32,281
Not you.

24
00:02:32,464 --> 00:02:36,786
Having said that, we are outraged by
the recent murder of the direct of the NPA

25
00:02:36,876 --> 00:02:38,495
and feel something must be done.

26
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,133
After revealing the information,

27
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:44,243
I believe there's a possibility that solving
this case could lead to the arrest of Kira.

28
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:47,159
As such, I'm willing to lend you my full support.

29
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,158
Lead to the arrest of Kira?

30
00:02:49,183 --> 00:02:50,485
Who is he anyway?

31
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,991
This confidence.

32
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:54,432
Is there a problem, L?

33
00:02:54,577 --> 00:02:55,667
N... No.

34
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:58,263
It's just that, following the death of Takimura,

35
00:02:58,457 --> 00:03:02,852
Deputy Director Yagami's daughter was kidnapped,
and we believe the same person is behind it.

36
00:03:02,877 --> 00:03:05,125
He's arranged for a trade in Los Angeles.

37
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:06,209
A trade?

38
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:08,819
The girl in exchange for the notebook, I assume.

39
00:03:09,592 --> 00:03:10,254
Yes.

40
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:11,869
Understood.

41
00:03:12,081 --> 00:03:13,868
I'll have a team on standby in LA,

42
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,391
but for now, they'll be working on a need to know basis.

43
00:03:16,557 --> 00:03:19,340
Also, I can monitor the city via satellite.

44
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:23,317
Or... On second thought,

45
00:03:23,401 --> 00:03:25,528
I'll let you have full authority on this, L.

46
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:30,106
That's good.

47
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:31,765
It means we're taking the lead.

48
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,422
But what's all this about the
Americans not trusting L anymore?

49
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:35,854
I don't like the sound of that.

50
00:03:38,078 --> 00:03:41,313
Near, is it really safe to leave
this case in the hands of a fake L?

51
00:03:41,338 --> 00:03:44,211
He hasn't had any success in catching Kira so far.

52
00:03:44,568 --> 00:03:45,576
I'm aware of that.

53
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:46,977
That's why it's a good idea.

54
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,650
It means there'll be an
opportunity to take advantage of him.

55
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:53,199
Of course, saving people's lives is important.

56
00:03:53,224 --> 00:03:56,157
But, as the SPK, our primary goal is very clear.

57
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:57,458
We'll work to get the notebook

58
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,676
and capture Kira once and for all.

59
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,067
Light.

60
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:03,868
Hm?

61
00:04:04,434 --> 00:04:07,434
At this point, I don't care if it costs me my life.

62
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,521
Please, just save Sayu.

63
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,962
Promise me.

64
00:04:12,423 --> 00:04:14,497
Stop talking like that, dad.

65
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:17,739
You might have made your peace with the idea of dying,

66
00:04:17,764 --> 00:04:21,667
but have you ever thought about how painful
it would be for everyone else you leave behind?

67
00:04:21,822 --> 00:04:25,449
I'd never be able to forgive you if
you ended up dying in front of Sayu.

68
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:26,921
Look.

69
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:28,880
It's true that you might lose contact with us.

70
00:04:28,905 --> 00:04:32,116
But if that happens and you have to
make a split second decision by yourself,

71
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:37,144
then I want you to do whatever's necessary to
make sure both you and Sayu get out of this alive.

72
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,722
Promise me, dad.

73
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:40,840
All right.

74
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:45,074
What? No way!

75
00:04:46,022 --> 00:04:48,647
You really want me to go to Los Angeles with you?

76
00:04:48,672 --> 00:04:49,342
Yeah.

77
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:52,166
There's a chance I might need to use your eyes this time,

78
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:54,219
so I want to have you close by.

79
00:04:55,057 --> 00:04:57,748
Oh, Light! You're the best!

80
00:04:58,252 --> 00:05:00,638
Oh, my gosh. I better start packing right away.

81
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,207
Let's see.

82
00:05:11,232 --> 00:05:13,635
Which one should I bring? I can't decide.

83
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:15,926
Light! Which do you like?

84
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:17,190
Huh?

85
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:20,606
Hm.

86
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:34,740
If things go badly, I may have to kill Sayu.

87
00:05:44,865 --> 00:05:48,565
Dad. I'll fly to LA ahead of you and
make preparations for the hand over.

88
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,563
Ide and the others should arrive shortly after.

89
00:05:50,588 --> 00:05:53,374
But to be safe, we should arrive on separate flights.

90
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:57,568
Aizawa, I want you to tail my father
closely and get on the same plane as him,

91
00:05:57,955 --> 00:05:59,646
just in case something goes wrong.

92
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:00,994
Got it.

93
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:03,302
I'm gonna get a haircut so they won't recognize me.

94
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:08,845
OK, everyone. I'm counting on you.

95
00:06:30,118 --> 00:06:31,367
Mr. Yagami.

96
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,656
Who are you?

97
00:06:32,745 --> 00:06:33,881
One of the kidnappers?

98
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:38,486
You're going to board Flight
SE333. I have your tickets with me.

99
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,589
It leaves from Gate 18.

100
00:06:40,614 --> 00:06:42,455
Right. I understand.

101
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:44,817
Someone has intercepted him at Narita.

102
00:06:44,842 --> 00:06:45,642
Should I arrest him?

103
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:46,749
Calm down, Aizawa.

104
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,274
Don't make any sudden.

105
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:51,939
I can understand your concern, but
arresting him now will accomplish nothing.

106
00:06:52,356 --> 00:06:54,818
Keep your distance, and don't lose sight of them.

107
00:06:55,988 --> 00:06:59,483
Damn it, They're boarding a difference
flight than originally planned.

108
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,876
I'll tell them at the gate I'm
a police officer, and they'll...

109
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:04,315
Get a hold of yourself!

110
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,965
You'd just blow your cover the operation would be ruined.

111
00:07:07,086 --> 00:07:08,940
Can you find out where the flight is headed?

112
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:09,673
Let's see.

113
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:10,706
Huh?

114
00:07:11,215 --> 00:07:12,734
This one's going to LA too.

115
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:15,725
Could they have somehow arranged for another plane.

116
00:07:15,824 --> 00:07:17,385
Oh, this is bad.

117
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:30,843
Flight SE33, Flight SE333, do you copy?

118
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:33,244
Do you copy? You have strayed from your flight path.

119
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,855
This is Flight SE333.

120
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,163
I read you loud and clear.

121
00:07:38,753 --> 00:07:40,773
I assure you, everything's OK.

122
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:42,619
This is a detour.

123
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:44,417
What the... What is this?

124
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,038
You need to tell me, what's going on up there?

125
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:48,556
This is not a hijacking.

126
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:50,587
We're simply making a detour,

127
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:52,821
and a quick stop to drop off a passenger.

128
00:07:52,882 --> 00:07:54,536
You can track us by radar.

129
00:07:54,568 --> 00:07:58,109
However, if you attempt to call the
authorities to interfere with our course,

130
00:07:58,134 --> 00:08:02,523
I will not hesitate to crash the plane
and take all the passengers with me.

131
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:08,443
This is bad, Light.

132
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:09,320
I mean L.

133
00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:12,261
The deputy director's flight has just changed direction.

134
00:08:12,422 --> 00:08:14,671
A passenger's gonna be dropped off somewhere.

135
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,202
It can only be him.

136
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,179
Damn it.

137
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:18,709
What the hell is going on?

138
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:22,448
I already checked today's flight
crews and passenger lists ahead of time.

139
00:08:22,705 --> 00:08:24,503
No one on board was suspicious.

140
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:27,213
The pilot's a veteran of over 15 years.

141
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:29,208
The copilot checks out clean, too.

142
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:33,806
Then the kidnappers are powerful
enough to influence these people.

143
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:37,496
Looks like I have no choice.

144
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:42,428
Director, this is L. Get me N.

145
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:43,943
Right.

146
00:08:44,122 --> 00:08:47,271
N. I'm sure you're aware of our current situation.

147
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:48,729
I need you to do me a favor.

148
00:08:48,754 --> 00:08:53,215
Can you notify the airline's police and
military on your end not to take any action yet?

149
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,134
What's he thinking?

150
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:56,444
I never realized he was this unreliable.

151
00:08:57,867 --> 00:08:59,772
All right, L. Agreed.

152
00:08:59,797 --> 00:09:04,620
We'll locate the landing site and keep surveillance
over the area using our satellite video feed.

153
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:06,983
If there's anything else we can do,

154
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,589
don't hesitate to let us know.

155
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:12,871
I have a message for you.

156
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:15,326
Put this in your ear.

157
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:22,068
Yagami.

158
00:09:22,223 --> 00:09:24,834
Right now, you're the only one who can hear my voice.

159
00:09:24,945 --> 00:09:26,946
Listen very carefully.

160
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:29,523
I'm the one who kidnapped your daughter.

161
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:31,350
But don't get the wrong idea.

162
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:37,348
I have no interest in your daughter's life
one way or the other, or yours, for that matter.

163
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:41,144
There's only one thing I want, and you know what that is.

164
00:09:41,673 --> 00:09:42,997
The notebook.

165
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:47,189
Now, all you have to do is follow my instructions.

166
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:49,578
If you do that, no one has to die.

167
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,520
As for the trade, I've prepared things
so that both of us can walk away satisfied.

168
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:56,769
Play along, and there'll be no problems.

169
00:09:57,466 --> 00:10:00,403
I'm going to give the notebook to some criminal

170
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:03,478
in exchange for my daughter's life.

171
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,389
When the time comes, what's the right thing to do?

172
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:14,484
As a police officer, as a human being, and as a parent?

173
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:57,856
L, we've been able to use our satellite
cameras to pinpoint where the plane has landed.

174
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:01,704
I'll send you a direct video feed
of what we're currently seeing here.

175
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,991
Dad.

176
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:04,652
Heh, heh, heh.

177
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:06,423
So what's gonna happen?

178
00:11:06,604 --> 00:11:08,982
How will he make the exchange in a place like that?

179
00:11:26,843 --> 00:11:28,814
You see the entrance, don't you, Yagami?

180
00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:30,260
Go inside.

181
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:31,690
They're underground?

182
00:11:31,715 --> 00:11:33,869
Well, well. Isn't that interesting?

183
00:11:37,476 --> 00:11:39,765
Dammit. An underground facility?

184
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,857
The kidnapper must have predicted
that we'd be watching him by satellite.

185
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:45,056
That means there's no way to keep an eye on Dad.

186
00:12:08,765 --> 00:12:11,252
The glass is bulletproof. Understand?

187
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,486
This place used to belong to a crime syndicate.

188
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:17,593
They used to make trades just like this.

189
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:20,162
We've made a few modifications, as well.

190
00:12:21,076 --> 00:12:22,759
Slide the notebook through here.

191
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,045
Once that's done, I'll release the lock.

192
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,804
We'll both step back and spin the glass door.

193
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,219
The notebook will end up on
my side, and the girl on yours.

194
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:34,529
However, if you don't agree to this trade,

195
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:37,089
I'll shoot your daughter through this opening.

196
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:47,252
L, do you have a plan?

197
00:12:47,631 --> 00:12:53,340
You can't seriously think that handing the notebook
over to someone you don't know is it good idea, can you?

198
00:12:53,942 --> 00:12:55,753
All right, Y462.

199
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,585
Proceed.

200
00:12:57,588 --> 00:13:02,976
First, open the notebook and insert it halfway
into the slot in the glass door on your left.

201
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:09,966
Dammit, dammit, dammit.

202
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:11,891
It's setback after setback.

203
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,675
And I've only just arrived in the US,

204
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,114
so I'm not in any position to start
giving orders to the American police.

205
00:13:18,577 --> 00:13:21,129
At this rate, the notebook's gonna be...

206
00:13:21,154 --> 00:13:22,895
Light, is everything OK?

207
00:13:22,955 --> 00:13:24,275
Is something wrong?

208
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:25,270
You look kind of...

209
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:27,516
Misa, just shut up and do what I told you, all right?

210
00:13:29,065 --> 00:13:33,070
Look, I need you to keep killing
Japanese criminals, so just do that.

211
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:36,132
This guy's obviously investigating
Kira, and he won't give up.

212
00:13:36,157 --> 00:13:38,016
If the killings are delayed, we're in trouble.

213
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,300
Don't you understand?

214
00:13:39,643 --> 00:13:41,315
Uh, OK.

215
00:13:41,393 --> 00:13:42,495
But who is this guy?

216
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,044
Just get on with it, all right!?

217
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,955
Taking out your anger on her, huh?

218
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:48,937
Hm?

219
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:55,589
I can still make it.

220
00:13:55,782 --> 00:14:01,250
But at this rate, is my only option to kill Sayu?

221
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:03,633
Now, then, I'll test the notebook.

222
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:05,545
Test it? You're going to kill someone?

223
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,009
No, I can't allow that.

224
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:11,353
We can't make the trade without
making sure it's the real thing.

225
00:14:11,812 --> 00:14:13,768
Do you really want to see your daughter die?

226
00:14:26,843 --> 00:14:28,376
I can't do it.

227
00:14:28,555 --> 00:14:30,888
No one but the police knows about this case.

228
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:34,097
If Sayu dies, I can't blame her death on Kira.

229
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,719
What's wrong? You OK, Miller?

230
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:45,331
Look. That's what you get when you steal
from me and sell goods behind my back.

231
00:14:45,543 --> 00:14:46,966
He was a worthlss idiot.

232
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:48,687
This is the first time he's been useful.

233
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:52,700
Y462, the target is dead.

234
00:14:54,065 --> 00:14:56,572
It seems the notebook is genuine after all.

235
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:58,043
Now let it go.

236
00:14:58,143 --> 00:15:00,049
We'll make the exchange for your daughter.

237
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:09,840
Dad.

238
00:15:10,058 --> 00:15:11,027
Sayu.

239
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:13,094
Hey, they actually made it.

240
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:15,182
The suspect is headed for a helicopter.

241
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:18,469
Based on our intel, that's his
only method of transportation.

242
00:15:19,182 --> 00:15:23,222
So this means we can be absolutely
certain that the notebook has been exchanged.

243
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:26,527
Be careful.

244
00:15:26,804 --> 00:15:29,706
We still don't know what they're
planning to do beyond this point.

245
00:15:29,731 --> 00:15:33,641
N, I need you to maintain surveillance
of that helicopter until it lands.

246
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:35,965
Don't lose sight of it, no matter what.

247
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:39,734
You seem to think that's quite an easy task.

248
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:42,164
Nevertheless, we'll do what we can.

249
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:46,702
I'm sorry. I'm afraid we've been tricked.

250
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,417
Huh?

251
00:16:01,277 --> 00:16:02,279
A missile?

252
00:16:02,304 --> 00:16:03,602
Whoa.

253
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:06,332
We won't be able to track that with radar.

254
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,739
Is the notebook on that thing?

255
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:18,144
The missile's been launched.

256
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:21,079
The missile or the helicopter?

257
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:21,969
Which one?

258
00:16:24,955 --> 00:16:27,140
Boss, I'm sure you were watching.

259
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:29,675
I did everyting you asked me to, just let we planned.

260
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:32,941
Yeah, I saw that. Good job.

261
00:16:32,966 --> 00:16:35,794
Then this is going to wipe out all
those past screw ups of mine, right?

262
00:16:36,264 --> 00:16:37,397
Oh, yeah.

263
00:16:37,444 --> 00:16:39,343
Wiped out for sure.

264
00:16:39,643 --> 00:16:40,466
Do it.

265
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:47,578
Near, the helicopter.

266
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:48,960
I thought so.

267
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:52,285
In that case, it means the
notebook is definitely on the missile.

268
00:16:52,362 --> 00:16:53,119
Damn!

269
00:16:53,298 --> 00:16:54,365
We can't track it.

270
00:16:54,554 --> 00:16:56,830
We've lost the signal. It could be anywhere now.

271
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:54,590
It won't be difficult to retrieve the
missile once it lands in a deserted area.

272
00:17:55,232 --> 00:17:57,798
He would have already laid
out the flight plan accordingly.

273
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:01,124
Should be getting his hands
on the notebook any moment now.

274
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:05,402
And when he does, I have a
good idea of what he'll do next.

275
00:19:10,832 --> 00:19:11,585
L.

276
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:16,468
Yes?

277
00:19:17,109 --> 00:19:18,288
He got us.

278
00:19:18,743 --> 00:19:19,657
Got you?

279
00:19:20,145 --> 00:19:21,039
Yes.

280
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:25,115
The majority of the SPK's members
have just been killed by the notebook.

281
00:19:28,754 --> 00:19:32,036
L, you were the one who handed
over the notebook without a fight.

282
00:19:32,061 --> 00:19:34,314
You and your people were totally helpless.

283
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:40,208
N, are you saying if you were in
command, you wouldn't have handed it over?

284
00:19:40,565 --> 00:19:41,250
No.

285
00:19:41,456 --> 00:19:43,425
Considering their preparations,

286
00:19:43,528 --> 00:19:45,953
it would have been impossible to avoid this.

287
00:19:46,278 --> 00:19:48,619
There's really no point in us quarreling.

288
00:19:49,243 --> 00:19:53,101
I propose we work together and
share the information we know so far.

289
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,077
For starters, I should admit that

290
00:19:55,102 --> 00:19:58,468
I have a very good idea of who
the culprit behind this might be.

291
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:05,537
I suspect the person who arranged the kidnapping
and the trade is someone who goes by the name Mello.

292
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,620
Mello?

293
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:07,771
Who's he?

294
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,859
I don't have his photograph,
and I don't know his real name.

295
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:13,698
All I know about him is that four years ago,

296
00:20:13,723 --> 00:20:16,524
he was living at an orphanage
located in Winchester, England,

297
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:18,669
known as Wammy's House.

298
00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:20,934
Wammy's House?

299
00:20:21,444 --> 00:20:23,716
That's the place Watari established.

300
00:20:24,132 --> 00:20:26,727
I believe Mello is playing a game with me.

301
00:20:26,812 --> 00:20:29,790
He wants to see which of us will
be the first to take down Kira.

302
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:31,671
The final challenge.

303
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,289
Uh, "Armo Justin?"

304
00:20:46,605 --> 00:20:48,578
It's Armonia Justin.

305
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:52,066
M'kay. Um, I've got a little problem.

306
00:20:52,091 --> 00:20:56,599
I went to the King to report that I lost
my notebook, but after I described it to him,

307
00:20:56,624 --> 00:20:58,826
the old man said that Ryuk said it was his,

308
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,828
and that he had dropped it and took it.

309
00:21:02,854 --> 00:21:05,254
So, what do you think I should do to get it back?

310
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,347
Guess you have no choice but to
find Ryuk and ask him yourself.

311
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,816
Yeah, that's what I thought.

312
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:16,622
So, I guess I have to go to the human world.

313
00:21:16,737 --> 00:21:18,239
Yep. That's right.

314
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,601
Have fun.

315
00:21:20,265 --> 00:21:21,969
Well, that sucks.

316
00:22:36,866 --> 00:22:38,492
Calm down and listen.

317
00:22:38,634 --> 00:22:43,801
On November 10, 11:59 PM, all the mafia members will die.

318
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:48,019
That moment will be your only
opportunity to get the notebook back.
