1
00:01:37,422 --> 00:01:42,210
Regardless of how she came to the conclusion,
the fact remains this woman knows the truth.

2
00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:44,814
If she gives this information to the police,

3
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:48,473
it won't take them very long to
figure out that Kira is actually me.

4
00:01:49,446 --> 00:01:52,001
I have no choice but to eliminate her.

5
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:53,381
Something wrong?

6
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,217
Oh, eh, it's nothing.

7
00:01:58,309 --> 00:02:01,663
But the more I think about it, the
more your theory makes sense to me.

8
00:02:01,944 --> 00:02:05,530
We can't waste any time. We need
to start investigating it right away.

9
00:02:05,565 --> 00:02:06,656
What? Really?

10
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:07,644
Do you mean that?

11
00:02:07,715 --> 00:02:08,523
Yes.

12
00:02:08,736 --> 00:02:11,069
So have you told anyone else about this?

13
00:02:11,094 --> 00:02:13,373
No you're the first person I've told.

14
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:16,543
You're lucky.

15
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:18,416
But how will you get rid of her?

16
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:20,412
It's not like you can do it here.

17
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:23,609
Well, you have a gift for stating the obvious, Ryuk.

18
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,091
Ah, hah. Aren't you bold?

19
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:28,251
Let's get started.

20
00:02:28,276 --> 00:02:31,271
Could you please tell me the date
and time of the busjacking incident?

21
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,454
It was December 20th, in front of Asagao Hill at 11:02 AM,

22
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,045
bound for Spaceland.

23
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:44,709
December 20th, and they were on their way to Spaceland.

24
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:45,603
Yes.

25
00:02:55,366 --> 00:02:57,833
This way no one will find her body.

26
00:02:57,858 --> 00:03:00,024
And even if they do, they'll just assume that

27
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:03,049
the death of her fiance drove her to commit suicide.

28
00:03:04,703 --> 00:03:05,496
Hmm?

29
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:07,661
What's so funny, Ryuk?

30
00:03:13,662 --> 00:03:16,322
I apologize for questioning all of you like that,

31
00:03:16,347 --> 00:03:18,336
but I'm afraid I had no other choice.

32
00:03:18,361 --> 00:03:20,505
I've determined that Kira is not among us.

33
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:26,214
Ryuzaki, how can you be certain that we're all innocent?

34
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,268
Well, to be honest, from the beginning

35
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:31,945
I set a number of traps that
would reveal if any of you was Kira.

36
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:35,988
But after speaking with you
one on one, I don't feel the need.

37
00:03:39,855 --> 00:03:40,903
Excuse me.

38
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,034
Unbelievable.

39
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,123
He tells us to turn off our cellphones.

40
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:48,435
Understood.

41
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:50,478
I'm just about finished here anyway.

42
00:03:50,503 --> 00:03:52,417
You've got the key, so let yourself in.

43
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,924
Watari's on his way.

44
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:59,058
So that's everything.

45
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,017
I'd like to report this incident to my father

46
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:02,815
if it's OK with you, that is.

47
00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:06,843
Well, if it's all the same, I
think I'd like to report it myself.

48
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:11,036
And after talking to you, I've decided that
it would be best to do it as soon as possible.

49
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:15,281
Uh, that makes sense.

50
00:04:18,102 --> 00:04:20,933
Just 10 seconds until 1:15.

51
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:25,146
I have to admit, I'd really love to see how she dies.

52
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,667
But I can't be caught following her around.

53
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:30,414
Go on.

54
00:04:30,934 --> 00:04:32,810
Hurry to your death.

55
00:04:46,555 --> 00:04:49,357
Kira will definitely be caught, don't you think?

56
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:50,070
huh?

57
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:52,937
Hm.

58
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:57,003
What's going on?

59
00:04:57,028 --> 00:04:59,037
It should've happened already.

60
00:05:02,144 --> 00:05:03,746
This doesn't make sense.

61
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,953
I don't understand why she's not leaving.

62
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,519
I've had no problems making
people kill themselves in the past.

63
00:05:09,544 --> 00:05:11,719
All I had to do is write the word suicide.

64
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:16,024
The criminals I tested it on all hung
themselves exactly when I specified.

65
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:19,332
My experiments indicate that in a situation like this,

66
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:21,785
I should be able to control a person's actions.

67
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,777
So what's wrong?

68
00:05:28,655 --> 00:05:34,205
Ryuk, he laughed just like that
when I was writing in the Death Note.

69
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:35,904
And that's not all.

70
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:39,332
I remember thinking it was bizarre
how he laughed when I asked for her name.

71
00:05:39,357 --> 00:05:43,234
In fact, he's reacted the same
way every time her name comes up.

72
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:45,204
An alias!

73
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:56,793
Gentlemen, it's an honor to meet all of you.

74
00:05:57,754 --> 00:05:59,357
This person is Watari?

75
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,845
Um, what about your usual outfit?

76
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:06,074
If I dressed like that, I'd be
announcing to the world that I am Watari.

77
00:06:06,307 --> 00:06:09,899
That's all it takes to give away the
location of our headquarters and Ryuzaki.

78
00:06:10,124 --> 00:06:11,536
Oh, I see.

79
00:06:11,855 --> 00:06:14,958
Ordinarily, I would never show my face to any of you.

80
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,365
The fact that I'm here is proof
that you've won Ryuzaki's trust.

81
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:21,002
Now that you mention it, I do feel honored.

82
00:06:23,614 --> 00:06:24,433
Well, then.

83
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,234
I brought those items you requested.

84
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,275
It's all here.

85
00:06:27,384 --> 00:06:29,584
Could you please pass them out to everyone?

86
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:30,528
Yes.

87
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:36,642
Gentlemen, these are your new police IDs.

88
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,542
But what for?

89
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,820
She used an alias, that has to be it.

90
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,436
Ryuk knew all along.

91
00:06:44,543 --> 00:06:46,693
He could see her real name with his eyes.

92
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:48,218
That's why he wouldn't stop laughing.

93
00:06:48,243 --> 00:06:49,303
I should've known.

94
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:51,672
She's been overly cautious from the beginning.

95
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:55,471
I see. It makes a lot of sense.

96
00:06:55,496 --> 00:06:56,894
She believes that Raye died

97
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:58,497
because he showed his ID to Kira.

98
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:01,967
So, of course, she'd be careful
not to reveal her own identity.

99
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:05,340
Oh, this isn't good.

100
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:10,001
It's gonna be almost impossible to ask for her
real name knowing she gave me an alias the first time.

101
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:12,631
If I'm too persistent, she'll get suspicious.

102
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:14,182
What am I saying?

103
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:17,487
It'll look suspicious that I
even knew she was using an alias.

104
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,653
I should probably be getting back soon.

105
00:07:21,047 --> 00:07:21,561
Hmm?

106
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:24,306
Someone from the task force might be back there by now.

107
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:25,876
Oh, yeah.

108
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,149
You could be right.

109
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,996
Let's cross our fingers and hope someone's there.

110
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:30,785
Yeah.

111
00:07:34,606 --> 00:07:35,341
Damn it.

112
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:37,275
I'm running out of options here.

113
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,313
I have to stop this before it's too late.

114
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:47,202
Oh, no.

115
00:07:47,256 --> 00:07:49,022
What if my father calls back now?

116
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:51,890
I already promised her that
I'd let her talk to him if he did.

117
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:53,888
This phone rings, it's all over for me.

118
00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:55,178
What am I gonna do?

119
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:01,207
This is crazy, all I have to do is turn my cell phone off.

120
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:03,788
Problem solved.

121
00:08:03,873 --> 00:08:05,206
Now, calm down.

122
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,306
You know what needs to be done,
just find out her real name.

123
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:11,771
Her purse, her pockets, she's
got to have a driver's license

124
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:14,497
or some kind of personal identification on her somewhere.

125
00:08:14,584 --> 00:08:16,071
She's a woman, after all.

126
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,831
I suppose if I had to, I could use force.

127
00:08:19,422 --> 00:08:20,367
No.

128
00:08:20,862 --> 00:08:23,395
No, the last thing I want to do is make a scene in public.

129
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,287
I've got to get her somewhere isolated.

130
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,581
But where?

131
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,650
And what explanation could I give her?

132
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:31,245
Ah, it would never work, she's too careful.

133
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:32,854
I need a better approach.

134
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:35,249
I can do this.

135
00:08:35,655 --> 00:08:38,346
I'm going to convince her to give me her real name.

136
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:41,455
Hey, Light.

137
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,217
You know, that deal I mentioned is still open.

138
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:47,182
It's just like putting on contact lenses.

139
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:48,918
Completely painless.

140
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:51,408
Would I be willing to give up half my life

141
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:53,796
just so I could learn this woman's real name?

142
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,584
No, I wouldn't.

143
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:58,817
In fact, it's not even worth considering.

144
00:08:58,842 --> 00:09:00,332
Now quit wasting my time!

145
00:09:00,357 --> 00:09:02,021
Just shut your mouth, shinigami.

146
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,162
Excuse me.

147
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:04,262
Yes?

148
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:07,356
Uh, do you still have business
at the police station, then?

149
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,136
I'd like to go there by myself, if you don't mind.

150
00:09:12,262 --> 00:09:13,704
Yeah. No problem.

151
00:09:14,284 --> 00:09:16,639
Our names and ranks are false.

152
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,780
Why did you give us fake IDs?

153
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,512
As you know, Kira requires a name and a face to kill.

154
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,062
We will confront him with that premise in mind.

155
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:28,094
And I think it should be obvious why.

156
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:31,586
Yes, but, of all people, the
police shouldn't use fake IDs.

157
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:32,200
Enough.

158
00:09:32,225 --> 00:09:35,275
What choice do we really have,
given the capabilities of our enemy?

159
00:09:35,435 --> 00:09:39,552
As long as you're working on this case, I think
we're going to need all the protection one can get.

160
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:41,550
It would be foolish not to use them.

161
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:43,375
Yeah, you got a good point.

162
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,430
Uh huh.

163
00:09:44,773 --> 00:09:46,782
Remember, any time you're in a situation

164
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:48,661
where you have to give out your name to a stranger,

165
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:50,867
make sure to use the name from your fake ID.

166
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:52,038
Understood?

167
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:56,279
Right, and be careful not to take them out
while in the presence of other police officers.

168
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:58,001
I'm sure I don't need to tell you

169
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,978
that could cause problems for us.

170
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:02,043
I understand.

171
00:10:02,283 --> 00:10:03,325
Very well, then.

172
00:10:04,624 --> 00:10:07,542
I'd like to request that you wear these at all times.

173
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:08,932
Uh, belts?

174
00:10:09,853 --> 00:10:12,553
Each one has a transmitter hidden in the buckle.

175
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,963
This will allow Ryuzaki to monitor your whereabouts.

176
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:18,922
And when you press the buckle twice like this,

177
00:10:19,872 --> 00:10:22,839
my cell phone will ring, displaying your name.

178
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:26,909
And I'll call you back immediately,
but you won't see my number displayed.

179
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:30,579
In the morning, all of you will
go to the police station as usual.

180
00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:32,427
Then, later on in the day,

181
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,089
we'll use this method to confirm the
name of Ryuzaki's hotel and his room number.

182
00:10:37,257 --> 00:10:39,532
Please use this for emergencies as well.

183
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:41,446
No way, this is totally cool!

184
00:10:41,471 --> 00:10:43,666
I feel like some kinda secret agent going after Kira.

185
00:10:43,691 --> 00:10:44,666
Quiet, Matsuda!

186
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,935
This is not the time to be fooling around.

187
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,760
Knock it off!

188
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:49,480
Yes, sir.

189
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:52,711
Thank you so much for everything you've done, Light.

190
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:56,349
After talking to you, I feel
much more confident about my theory.

191
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,905
Not at all.

192
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,679
Considering that Ryuk mentioned that eye deal again,

193
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:10,953
there's no doubt in my mind that she used an alias.

194
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:15,938
At this rate, once she goes to the police
with her theory about Kira being on that bus,

195
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,718
and they look at all the people
Raye Pember was investigating,

196
00:11:19,027 --> 00:11:21,307
it won't take them long to zero in on me.

197
00:11:22,897 --> 00:11:24,850
Hey, she's leaving.

198
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:25,938
So now what?

199
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:28,546
I've got about five minutes

200
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:30,730
before that woman gets to police headquarters.

201
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:31,631
Think.

202
00:11:31,672 --> 00:11:33,044
I need her real name.

203
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:34,849
And I don't have much time to spare.

204
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:50,586
If this woman makes it to the police station

205
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:53,081
and someone from the task force has returned by then,

206
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:54,854
it'll all be over for me.

207
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:57,242
I've gotta find out her real name,

208
00:11:57,307 --> 00:11:59,032
then eliminate her quickly.

209
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:01,834
Only three minutes left until she reaches the station.

210
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:05,227
All right.

211
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:07,339
Oh? Whatcha doing?

212
00:12:07,813 --> 00:12:08,942
Excuse me?

213
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:09,717
Yes?

214
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:13,017
There's something that I should probably tell you.

215
00:12:13,512 --> 00:12:14,369
OK.

216
00:12:15,113 --> 00:12:16,841
The thing is, it'll be impossible

217
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:19,669
for you to contact anyone from the task force directly.

218
00:12:19,757 --> 00:12:20,366
Huh?

219
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:23,666
That's right, keep the conversation going.

220
00:12:23,691 --> 00:12:24,847
I just need to find something that

221
00:12:24,872 --> 00:12:26,720
she can latch onto and I've got her.

222
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,256
When she's comfortable, then I can get her real name.

223
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,484
I can do this.

224
00:12:30,535 --> 00:12:32,111
I can't contact anyone?

225
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:32,885
But why not?

226
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,019
Didn't you find it odd that there
was no one at task force headquarters?

227
00:12:36,044 --> 00:12:37,404
Uh, yeah.

228
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:39,667
I did find it a bit strange, but I didn't.

229
00:12:39,735 --> 00:12:40,602
Let me explain.

230
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:43,820
The task force has been organized so
that its members can't be identified

231
00:12:43,845 --> 00:12:46,359
and nobody on the outside knows who's in charge.

232
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:49,788
If the member's names were ever made public

233
00:12:49,813 --> 00:12:52,005
or the structure of the task force was revealed,

234
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,363
we'd likely see another tragedy along the lines of

235
00:12:54,388 --> 00:12:56,285
the one that claimed your fiance's life.

236
00:13:01,595 --> 00:13:02,529
I see.

237
00:13:03,357 --> 00:13:07,261
That's why you were told earlier that
no one was at task force headquarters.

238
00:13:07,843 --> 00:13:09,187
What I'm trying to say is,

239
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:12,093
you'll never be able to talk to
someone directly from the task force,

240
00:13:12,118 --> 00:13:14,117
because the police simply won't allow it.

241
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:18,914
That's pretty clever.

242
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:20,097
I'm impressed.

243
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,685
If this is supposed to be a
secret, then how do you know so much?

244
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:27,212
Guess I spoke too soon. She's sharp.

245
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:31,037
Very well.

246
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:32,529
You leave me no choice.

247
00:13:33,488 --> 00:13:36,346
It's because I'm actually a member of the task force.

248
00:13:36,371 --> 00:13:37,139
Huh?

249
00:13:37,428 --> 00:13:39,801
I'm sorry, you're telling me that you're an agent?

250
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:40,891
Yes.

251
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:44,649
L is currently in charge of the task
force and he's leading our investigation.

252
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:45,345
Yes.

253
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,620
To be honest, I already suspected that.

254
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:51,535
He was concerned that the task force had become too small.

255
00:13:51,842 --> 00:13:55,102
Many detectives had quit, fearing for their lives, and so,

256
00:13:55,302 --> 00:14:00,203
despite the fact that I'm a high school student, he
brought me on board to help out with the investigation.

257
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:03,002
After all, I've helped them solve cases in the past.

258
00:14:03,027 --> 00:14:05,026
So L trusts you, then?

259
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:08,297
I can go to task force headquarters whenever it suits me,

260
00:14:08,322 --> 00:14:11,699
and I'm allowed to investigate freely as I see fit.

261
00:14:11,724 --> 00:14:15,313
You see, these days the task
force is made up of a chosen few,

262
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:18,675
an elite group of people handpicked for the job by L.

263
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:22,933
All are highly skilled, well
respected, and, above all, trustworthy.

264
00:14:23,354 --> 00:14:24,041
Oh.

265
00:14:34,876 --> 00:14:37,253
Thanks for explaining, but just to be safe,

266
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:39,967
I'd like to try and visit the
task force headquarters again.

267
00:14:39,992 --> 00:14:40,582
Huh?

268
00:14:40,607 --> 00:14:41,315
Goodbye.

269
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,370
Uh, please. Wait a second.

270
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:50,077
It's like I just told you,
they won't let you talk to anyone.

271
00:14:50,343 --> 00:14:53,326
I know, but I was hoping I could speak with L directly.

272
00:14:58,103 --> 00:15:01,563
Oh, and come to think of it who's
at the police station right now?

273
00:15:01,588 --> 00:15:03,434
Actually, no one's there at the moment.

274
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:05,026
That's not good news.

275
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:06,910
We need someone there at all times.

276
00:15:06,935 --> 00:15:08,423
Work in shifts if you have to.

277
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:09,501
I understand.

278
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:11,990
Aizawa. I'll put you in charge of that for today.

279
00:15:12,015 --> 00:15:12,948
Yes sir.

280
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:15,034
I'm on my way. Won't take me long.

281
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:17,573
Ms. Maki, please wait a second.

282
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:20,893
It's literally impossible to meet L. This is pointless.

283
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:26,737
You may be right,

284
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:29,144
but I think that there's a chance that he'll meet with me.

285
00:15:29,317 --> 00:15:29,940
Huh?

286
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:34,018
Although the only contact I've had with
him was following orders through a computer,

287
00:15:34,126 --> 00:15:35,726
he might remember who I am.

288
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:39,332
You see, I worked under him in a
case in the US about two years ago.

289
00:15:39,592 --> 00:15:42,334
Uh, are you serious? You worked under L?

290
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:46,409
Yes I didn't tell you this, but up until three months ago,

291
00:15:46,434 --> 00:15:47,963
I worked as an FBI agent.

292
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:50,416
This is it.

293
00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:52,199
Finally, something I can use.

294
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:54,684
Guess I shouldn't be surprised.

295
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:59,635
In fact, I noticed early on that your investigative
skills were far beyond those of an amateur.

296
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:03,628
You're very cautious and you seem to have a
gift for getting to the heart of the matter.

297
00:16:03,653 --> 00:16:05,561
If I could, I'd like to learn from you.

298
00:16:07,476 --> 00:16:08,894
One lie after another.

299
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,345
You make it look easy.

300
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,882
From the beginning, I knew I had to
do things outside the regular channels

301
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:18,300
because, from my perspective, both the police
and the members of the task force were suspects.

302
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:21,381
But I'm certain that I can trust L.

303
00:16:22,744 --> 00:16:24,261
Maybe it's unrealistic,

304
00:16:24,662 --> 00:16:27,956
but I think that if I go to
headquarters and I give them my name,

305
00:16:28,038 --> 00:16:30,750
there's a chance that they'll
let me speak with him directly.

306
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,174
I see.

307
00:16:32,843 --> 00:16:36,854
But if the only person you could
trust with this info was L, then why me?

308
00:16:37,628 --> 00:16:41,548
I suppose I was upset that they wouldn't
allow me to see anyone from the task force,

309
00:16:41,573 --> 00:16:45,203
then and you came along, claiming to
be the son of the lead detective and...

310
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:47,526
no, that's not it.

311
00:16:49,382 --> 00:16:50,718
I'll be honest with you.

312
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,725
It's because you remind me of L.

313
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:57,426
There's something about you that's just like him.

314
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:08,516
Will you investigate this case with me?

315
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,139
Huh?

316
00:17:09,825 --> 00:17:13,651
I want you to come work with us as part
of the task force. We could use your help.

317
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:17,302
As I'm sure you know, not just anyone can do it.

318
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:20,804
Please, I know this is sudden,
but the team needs people like you.

319
00:17:21,062 --> 00:17:22,141
I'm serious.

320
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,092
You could be doing so much more
than gathering information on your own.

321
00:17:25,117 --> 00:17:27,643
You have all the experience as an FBI agent.

322
00:17:27,668 --> 00:17:30,956
You're more talented than most of the
detectives currently on the task force,

323
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:33,513
and L obviously trusted you in the past.

324
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,695
It wouldn't be that difficult for you to join.

325
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,336
All you'd need is some valid identification, a
recommendation from a current task force member,

326
00:17:40,361 --> 00:17:42,711
and of course you'd need to get L's permission.

327
00:17:43,065 --> 00:17:45,117
You want me to join the task force?

328
00:17:45,595 --> 00:17:48,840
I can't help but think that it
must be fate that I met you today.

329
00:17:49,106 --> 00:17:51,369
I'd like to be the one to recommend you.

330
00:17:55,402 --> 00:17:57,326
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

331
00:17:57,432 --> 00:17:59,366
I guess I got a little bit too excited.

332
00:17:59,584 --> 00:18:00,540
It's OK.

333
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:04,835
I mean, even if you acted as a consultant on
this investigation, it would be a great help.

334
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,462
I'm sure you have personal obligations to attend to,

335
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,099
not to mention the fact that
you live in the United States.

336
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:12,291
It's true, before all this happened,

337
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:15,510
I thought I'd continue living in America with my fiance.

338
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:18,042
We'd planned on getting married in the spring.

339
00:18:18,335 --> 00:18:21,490
But now he's gone, so I'm not sure what to do anymore.

340
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,143
All right, I've come this far.

341
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,189
All she needs is a little encouragement.

342
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:28,640
But you're young and beautiful and
you've got your life ahead of you.

343
00:18:28,665 --> 00:18:30,606
Why put it all in danger for this?

344
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:31,346
No!

345
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:33,881
Now that Raye's gone, I've got nothing to lose any more.

346
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,218
I want to catch Kira.

347
00:18:35,243 --> 00:18:37,694
I don't care about anything else. It's all I want to do.

348
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:39,971
Please, let me investigate this case with you.

349
00:18:40,243 --> 00:18:41,043
Huh?

350
00:18:48,956 --> 00:18:50,293
Yes, of course.

351
00:18:50,684 --> 00:18:54,459
I just need to see some form of
identification before we proceed.

352
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,451
Oh! Um...

353
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:57,251
Yes?

354
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,285
You see, the name I gave you earlier,
well it wasn't actually my real name.

355
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,227
I'm so sorry.

356
00:19:06,122 --> 00:19:07,586
Don't worry. It's all right.

357
00:19:07,611 --> 00:19:11,136
To be honest, I'm impressed by
how incredibly thorough you've been.

358
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:13,369
You've stayed one step ahead of me.

359
00:19:13,513 --> 00:19:16,561
But I suppose that's just
further proof of your capabilities.

360
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:19,344
So will a Japanese driver's license do the trick, then?

361
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,105
Sure.

362
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,183
I made it in time.

363
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:01,274
Uh, so, if you don't mind my asking,
why do you keep checking your watch?

364
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:02,724
Oh.

365
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,533
Well, I guess it's because...

366
00:20:09,493 --> 00:20:11,061
because I'm Kira.

367
00:20:41,891 --> 00:20:43,300
What's the matter?

368
00:20:44,168 --> 00:20:45,941
There's something I have to do.

369
00:20:47,224 --> 00:20:47,911
Hmm.

370
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:52,900
My father's cellphone might be available now.

371
00:20:53,147 --> 00:20:55,129
Do you want to see if you can talk to him?

372
00:20:56,148 --> 00:20:57,370
No, thank you.

373
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:59,006
I have nothing to say to him.

374
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:03,513
Then goodbye, Naomi Misora.

375
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,999
With Ryuk's information and my preparations,

376
00:22:41,024 --> 00:22:42,892
I can continue to kill criminals

377
00:22:42,917 --> 00:22:45,552
while masquerading as a typical high school student

378
00:22:45,577 --> 00:22:47,355
studying for his entrance exams.

379
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,511
Just watch me, L.
