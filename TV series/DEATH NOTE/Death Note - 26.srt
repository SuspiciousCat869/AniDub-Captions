1
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:31,702
Huh?

2
00:01:31,914 --> 00:01:32,962
What is this?

3
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:46,227
Everyone, the Shiniga...

4
00:02:07,948 --> 00:02:10,484
Now, try to kill me.

5
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,450
Although this was announced as a worldwide broadcast,

6
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:18,666
the truth is we are only broadcasting
in the Kanto region of Japan.

7
00:02:18,784 --> 00:02:22,650
In actuality, the fist of your
victims was a suspect in Shinjuku.

8
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:26,491
Furthermore, his crime was
only ever reported inside Japan.

9
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:29,694
I used that information to deduce this much.

10
00:02:29,736 --> 00:02:34,326
You are in Japan, and your first
victim was little more than an experiment,

11
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:37,474
which means that you haven't been killing for very long.

12
00:02:38,814 --> 00:02:43,403
Kira has found a way to obtain
information from the Task Force Headquarters.

13
00:02:43,428 --> 00:02:45,766
There are 141 people in the police force

14
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:49,120
who have acces to classified
information regarding the investigation.

15
00:02:49,353 --> 00:02:52,673
I am sure that somewhere in this list of police officers,

16
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:55,450
and the people closest to them,

17
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:57,558
we will find our suspect.

18
00:03:01,704 --> 00:03:05,986
On December 14th, 12 FBI investigators entered Japan.

19
00:03:07,457 --> 00:03:09,637
Here are are on December 19th.

20
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:15,638
Using prison inmates, Kira conducts experiments
manipulating his victim's actions before they die.

21
00:03:16,204 --> 00:03:21,624
He needed to know how much control he had over his
victims before he could use it against the 12 agents.

22
00:03:23,186 --> 00:03:26,473
I suspect Kira had to be one
of the people being investigated

23
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:30,415
by the FBI between the 14th and the 19th of December.

24
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:32,706
In fact, I have no doubt.

25
00:03:39,026 --> 00:03:40,743
Raye Penber's fiance?

26
00:03:41,282 --> 00:03:42,881
Naomi Misora.

27
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:44,919
So it's her.

28
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:46,678
She was working under me.

29
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,623
I guess she must have come to Japan with her fiance.

30
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:52,126
I heard she was seen with Penber.

31
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:55,773
It's possible that she may have found a lead.

32
00:03:55,798 --> 00:03:59,506
If that's the case, did Kira manage to get to her first?

33
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:11,233
Everyone, at this point I'd
like to focus our investigation

34
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,644
on only those people who Raye Penber was tailing.

35
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,144
There are two groups.

36
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:18,175
Deputy Director Kitamura,

37
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:21,577
as well as Detective Superintendent
Yagami and their families.

38
00:04:22,413 --> 00:04:27,713
At this stage I'd like to place wiretaps
and surveillance cameras in both households.

39
00:04:27,738 --> 00:04:29,308
That's my son you're talking about.

40
00:04:29,558 --> 00:04:32,091
Are you honestly telling me that you suspect him?

41
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:33,596
I do suspect him.

42
00:04:37,073 --> 00:04:38,731
I want to you, I'm L.

43
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:46,648
Relax, Light.

44
00:04:46,673 --> 00:04:48,698
While it's try that Kira hates losing,

45
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:51,923
it's also true that most people
would rather win than lose.

46
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,290
It's human nature.

47
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:55,427
Look at that.

48
00:04:55,452 --> 00:04:57,267
He's going for the win.

49
00:04:57,292 --> 00:05:01,237
I suspect that you, Light Yagami, are in fact Kira.

50
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,019
You think I'm Kira?

51
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:11,017
Ryuga, what would it take to get
you to believe that I'm not Kira?

52
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:12,409
Please, isn't there something?

53
00:05:12,434 --> 00:05:15,277
If you are not Kira, that truth will be revealed.

54
00:05:15,302 --> 00:05:16,813
Just let things run their course.

55
00:05:24,046 --> 00:05:24,927
Four days ago...

56
00:05:24,952 --> 00:05:27,235
Our audience rating should go up 60%

57
00:05:27,264 --> 00:05:29,766
no, more like 70% percent after this.

58
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,939
...contained a prediction of two
deaths, proving that he is Kira.

59
00:05:33,003 --> 00:05:36,601
We understand that the second tape
contains a message to all people of the world.

60
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:38,080
I am Kira.

61
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:40,583
The news anchor, Mr. Kazuhiko Hibima,

62
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:43,395
will die of a heart attack at exactly 6:00.

63
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,721
Stop this broadcast!

64
00:05:44,746 --> 00:05:46,280
We can't let him finish!

65
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:48,133
You idiots!

66
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:54,347
You told us that Kira couldn't kill without a name!

67
00:05:54,372 --> 00:05:56,160
But from what we've just seen,

68
00:05:56,185 --> 00:06:00,489
I'd say it's not entirely impossible
that Kira can kill with only a face.

69
00:06:03,547 --> 00:06:04,481
This is the police.

70
00:06:04,506 --> 00:06:06,100
Stop this broadcast now!

71
00:06:06,402 --> 00:06:09,746
There's a strong possibility that this Kira's a fake.

72
00:06:10,058 --> 00:06:13,344
No, we should think of him more as a second Kira.

73
00:06:13,658 --> 00:06:19,269
Mr. Yagami, I'd like your permission to ask
your son to cooperate with us on this investigation.

74
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:24,147
At the very least, I'd say this
isn't the Kira we're familiar with.

75
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:28,060
That's almost exactly how L, I mean, Ryuzaki said it.

76
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:32,562
When we meet, we can confirm our identities
by showing our Shinigami to each other.

77
00:06:35,702 --> 00:06:38,378
If there's a message here written in some code

78
00:06:38,403 --> 00:06:42,000
that only people who have this
Shinigami power can understand,

79
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:44,376
there'd no way for me to decipher it.

80
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,659
Still, it would only make sense
for us to look into all of the places

81
00:06:47,684 --> 00:06:49,450
that were mentioned in the journal.

82
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,213
When you two are working together,

83
00:06:51,238 --> 00:06:53,899
I want you to keep a close eye on Light the entire time.

84
00:06:53,924 --> 00:06:56,378
It's only a slim chance, but if Light is Kira,

85
00:06:56,403 --> 00:07:00,126
then there's still a possibility that the
second Kira may try to contact him somehow.

86
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:04,042
Also, Mr Yagami, please ask
Mr. Mogi to start following Light,

87
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:06,342
so he can keep tabs on what he's doing.

88
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:11,527
Light, there you are.

89
00:07:11,552 --> 00:07:14,317
Hi there. I'm Light's girlfriend, Misa Amane.

90
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:15,217
Nice to meet you.

91
00:07:15,242 --> 00:07:16,443
I'm Hideki Ryuga.

92
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:18,435
Huh? Hideki Ryuga?

93
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,391
I'm not exactly sure how you'll take this,

94
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,941
but regarding Misa Amane,
there's something you should know.

95
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:26,740
We've taken her into custody under
suspicion of her being the second Kira.

96
00:07:26,982 --> 00:07:30,479
We gathered physical evidence from
the envelope sent by the second Kira,

97
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:34,351
and particular hairs and fibers caught
in the masking tape used to seal them.

98
00:07:34,376 --> 00:07:36,688
They matched what we found in Misa's room.

99
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,979
Ryuzaki, what's the meaning of this?

100
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:43,772
Now hurry up and kill me!

101
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:46,391
If you wanted to, you could
kill me right now, couldn't you?

102
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,495
Does this mean you admit to being the second Kira?

103
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,186
Is this the reason you wish to die?

104
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:50,708
No.

105
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:53,708
I don't know anything about the second Kira.

106
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:58,873
Ryuzaki, like I said over the phone, I could be Kira.

107
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:02,825
Why come here to announce that you could be Kira?

108
00:08:02,936 --> 00:08:04,038
It's an act.

109
00:08:04,063 --> 00:08:05,617
There's no could be about it.

110
00:08:05,642 --> 00:08:06,783
You are Kira.

111
00:08:07,702 --> 00:08:09,480
Light, are you feeling OK?

112
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:10,380
Yeah.

113
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:16,193
I know I must look pretty bad in here, but
this useless pride I suppose I'll have to...

114
00:08:17,388 --> 00:08:18,487
get rid of it.

115
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:22,389
Ryuzaki, I realize that I was
the one pushing for confinement,

116
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:24,369
and that I asked you put me in here,

117
00:08:24,394 --> 00:08:26,240
but this whole thing's completely pointless.

118
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:29,090
I'm not Kira. You have to get me out of here!

119
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:29,953
I just heard.

120
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:32,603
Two weeks' worth of criminals
were just murdered all at once.

121
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:33,918
It happened yesterday.

122
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:37,304
I don't understand what's going on here.

123
00:08:40,195 --> 00:08:43,024
I'm not sure how much more of
this the three of them can take.

124
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:46,146
Ryuzaki, you have no reason
to keep Light locked up anymore.

125
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:48,105
It's already been 50 days.

126
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,192
I'm going to kill you here, and then kill myself.

127
00:08:53,217 --> 00:08:53,897
What?

128
00:08:54,021 --> 00:08:55,402
What are you talking about, Dad?

129
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:56,517
You can't, that's crazy!

130
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:57,376
How can you even say that?

131
00:08:57,401 --> 00:08:58,198
It's too late.

132
00:08:58,514 --> 00:09:00,866
Please, don't, Dad! I'm not Kira!

133
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:04,568
Light, my son... from one murderer to another...

134
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,264
No, Dad!

135
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:06,727
I'll see you in hell.

136
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,180
No! Stop it!

137
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:17,399
It was a convincing performance.

138
00:09:17,547 --> 00:09:20,255
As we discussed, I will end their confinement immediately.

139
00:09:20,923 --> 00:09:23,233
As for your part in this agreement, Light,

140
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:26,415
you and I will be together 24/7,

141
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:30,215
and that's how it will remain
until we've brought Kira to justice.

142
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:38,333
Their deaths have all worked in Yotsuba's favor.

143
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:42,633
Looking back, there have been 13
similar deaths in the past three months.

144
00:09:42,658 --> 00:09:44,704
Is Kira someone from Yotsuba?

145
00:09:44,773 --> 00:09:47,014
Or is Kira simply using Yotsuba?

146
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,465
I haven't figured that out yet,

147
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,956
but we'll proceed under the
assumption that this is Kira's doing.

148
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:54,247
We will focus on Yotsuba.

149
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:58,085
Please be sure not to act
impulsively, out of panic or haste.

150
00:09:58,236 --> 00:10:00,179
And don't take matters into your own hands.

151
00:10:00,204 --> 00:10:02,532
I'm an agent with Yoshida Productions.

152
00:10:02,557 --> 00:10:05,922
Would you be interested in using
Misa Amane as your new spokesperson?

153
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:07,699
Ryuzaki, are you watching this?

154
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:11,369
The eight men who came here were having a
meeting to decide who they get Kira to kill for them.

155
00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:15,333
If Matsuda dies, our suspicions about
the Yotsuba Group would be confirmed.

156
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:17,583
Do you think there's anything I can do to save myself?

157
00:10:17,608 --> 00:10:19,910
Matsuda, you idiot.

158
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:23,883
Good luck, Misa Misa!

159
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:27,551
I'll be here ready to celebrate
when they decide to hire you!

160
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:30,176
It's always been my dream to become Kira's wife.

161
00:10:30,201 --> 00:10:32,257
I know he'll need me by his side.

162
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:34,363
And you know why?

163
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,536
Because I'm the second Kira.

164
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:41,633
Well, since I happen to be Kira,
does that mean you'll marry me, Misa?

165
00:10:41,658 --> 00:10:44,996
So, based on what he said, Higuchi is Kira.

166
00:10:45,703 --> 00:10:47,344
So, what are you gonna do?

167
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:49,574
I'm going to trick Higuchi using Sakura TV.

168
00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:50,946
Like a hidden camera show!

169
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:52,339
Higuchi, we've got a problem.

170
00:10:52,364 --> 00:10:53,610
Turn on the television.

171
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:54,426
Huh?

172
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,919
So you're saying one of those people is Kira, right?

173
00:10:57,944 --> 00:11:00,721
Yes. I've got a lot of evidence to prove it, too.

174
00:11:02,436 --> 00:11:03,736
It's... it's him!

175
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:05,270
Why is he still alive?

176
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:11,241
I see Higuchi. I'm in pursuit.

177
00:11:11,735 --> 00:11:12,858
We're heading after him.

178
00:11:17,545 --> 00:11:19,039
You in the red car!

179
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:22,037
Pull over to the side of the road. Now!

180
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:24,256
Rem. Let's make the deal.

181
00:11:24,286 --> 00:11:25,286
A deal?

182
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:28,177
You were speeding. License, please?

183
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:29,653
Yeah. No problem.

184
00:11:33,014 --> 00:11:33,598
Hey!

185
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:35,780
Higuchi ditched the cop. He's driving away.

186
00:11:35,805 --> 00:11:37,751
This is Traffic Control...

187
00:11:39,748 --> 00:11:40,600
Everyone!

188
00:11:41,037 --> 00:11:43,833
It's too dangerous to allow further action by Higuchi.

189
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:45,248
Let's bring him in.

190
00:11:45,735 --> 00:11:48,276
I believe he has the same powers as the second Kira.

191
00:11:48,301 --> 00:11:50,966
He is able to kill just by looking at someone's face.

192
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:53,821
Please keep this in mind when you move in to arrest him.

193
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,093
Stop right there.

194
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:02,678
Stay back!

195
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:04,729
Stay back or I'll shoot, I swear!

196
00:12:04,798 --> 00:12:05,395
Ah!

197
00:12:07,947 --> 00:12:10,665
Higuchi, how were you able to kill people?

198
00:12:11,036 --> 00:12:14,327
You probably won't believe me,
but I've got a special notebook.

199
00:12:14,352 --> 00:12:18,143
If I write someone's name in it while
thinking of their face, that person dies.

200
00:12:18,168 --> 00:12:20,789
It was in one of the compartments of Higuchi's bag.

201
00:12:23,113 --> 00:12:24,815
What is it, Mr. Yagami?

202
00:12:25,402 --> 00:12:27,560
It's a monster!

203
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:32,668
A Shinigami.

204
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:35,511
There have to be two notebooks.

205
00:12:35,536 --> 00:12:36,713
Possibly more.

206
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:38,435
This isn't over yet.

207
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:43,275
How to use it.

208
00:12:43,636 --> 00:12:46,559
It says the human whose name is written in this notebook

209
00:12:46,614 --> 00:12:47,699
shall die.

210
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:51,085
And then there's this last rule.

211
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:54,852
According to this, if the person using the note

212
00:12:54,877 --> 00:12:58,326
fails to consecutively write names of people to be killed

213
00:12:58,351 --> 00:13:02,206
within 13 day Of each other, then the user will die.

214
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:06,169
Light Yagami and Misa Amane are both still alive.

215
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:08,869
13 days.

216
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:10,816
That's the only problem.

217
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:19,457
The following is the record which contains everything

218
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:22,307
I have investigated on the Kira incident.

219
00:13:23,191 --> 00:13:28,426
That fact that now you are reading this
message means I am no longer alive at this moment.

220
00:13:30,591 --> 00:13:34,565
I hereby leave this record as my firm achievement.

221
00:13:35,246 --> 00:13:36,188
That is all.

222
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:03,518
It's been 10 days since Ryuzaki's funeral.

223
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,771
Look like we're not gonna die after all.

224
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:08,746
We know Watari's true identity now,

225
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:11,605
but we never found out anything
about who Ryuzaki really was.

226
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,580
Yeah, that's true.

227
00:14:12,605 --> 00:14:15,767
Who could have guessed that Watari
was actually a famous inventor?

228
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:21,523
The paper says he founded orphanages around the
world using the fortune he inherited from his patents.

229
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:22,890
He was a fine man.

230
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:23,791
A hero.

231
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:25,507
But it doesn't help us now.

232
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:29,964
We can't continue investigating using
this place as our base with L and Watari gone.

233
00:14:30,174 --> 00:14:31,348
This is tough.

234
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,677
Light, how's it going?

235
00:14:34,296 --> 00:14:38,721
I should be able to transfer the system and
most of the information out of here by tonight.

236
00:14:38,862 --> 00:14:39,962
It's weird, though.

237
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,036
I almost feel as if I'm stealing.

238
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,624
I've created a voice filter identical
to the one reason Ryuzaki used.

239
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:50,080
We can use it to make the police think he's still
alive, and give them orders like we've been doing so far.

240
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:53,088
But who is going to take the place of L?

241
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:54,699
Where will he work from,

242
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,688
and what will we do with the notebook?

243
00:14:56,713 --> 00:14:58,438
Come on. What are you talking about, Light?

244
00:14:58,537 --> 00:15:00,865
You're the only one who can take on the role of L.

245
00:15:01,271 --> 00:15:02,065
Huh?

246
00:15:04,518 --> 00:15:05,662
I don't know.

247
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:08,654
Ryuzaki was killed by Kira because he challenged him.

248
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,783
That's not something I'm eager to do.

249
00:15:10,871 --> 00:15:13,745
Besides, I would be fooling the people of the world.

250
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:17,984
I can understand how you feel, but you're
really the only one of us who can do this.

251
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:18,657
That's right.

252
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:20,646
Even Ryuzaki said so himself.

253
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:23,027
You would be capable of succeeding L.

254
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:26,941
Just as I thought.

255
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:28,338
It's too simple.

256
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:31,035
It's no fun without Ryuzaki here.

257
00:15:31,896 --> 00:15:33,029
I understand.

258
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:34,732
All right, I'll do it.

259
00:15:35,722 --> 00:15:38,415
But I won't be like Ryuzaki.

260
00:15:38,498 --> 00:15:42,373
I won't take big risks like
challenging Kira directly to gather clues.

261
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:43,547
it's just not me.

262
00:15:43,572 --> 00:15:46,837
Yeah. It's probably better if we play it safe.

263
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,943
Ryuzaki may have been a little too confrontational.

264
00:15:49,973 --> 00:15:54,795
In that case, I'll be able to do the same
sort of work using both this computer and my own.

265
00:15:54,842 --> 00:15:58,958
In fact, it'll be possible for me to
act as L in the comfort of my own room.

266
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,302
I can be Watari, as well.

267
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,987
But it'll be difficult to pull
off with Mom and Sayu around.

268
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:08,889
Things would be easier if I
could rent a one bedroom apartment.

269
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:10,579
Well, considering your age,

270
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:14,183
it certainly wouldn't look odd to
anyone if I let you move out on your own.

271
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,213
Hey, yeah.

272
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:18,460
And then we'll be able to use Light's new
apartment as our Task Force Headquarters.

273
00:16:18,485 --> 00:16:19,695
That's a great idea.

274
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:23,695
All that's left to figure out
now is what to do with the notebook.

275
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:25,393
It's really not that difficult.

276
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,771
There's five of us here.

277
00:16:27,796 --> 00:16:29,896
And we know none of us will ever use the notebook.

278
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:33,643
We'll just have one of us take it and hide it
somewhere where no one else could ever get to it.

279
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,700
Please, Chief. It's got to be you.

280
00:16:38,017 --> 00:16:40,437
Uh, yeah, Chief. We can count on you.

281
00:16:40,462 --> 00:16:42,432
You're a pillar of justice, after all.

282
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:46,891
You want me to... all right.

283
00:16:47,184 --> 00:16:49,399
We'll avenge Ryuzaki together.

284
00:16:50,294 --> 00:16:53,020
Yeah. Kira is still out there somewhere.

285
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,860
We'll catch him. That's a promise.

286
00:16:56,329 --> 00:17:00,051
Well then, why don't we have a little
party to celebrate Light becoming L number two?

287
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:01,051
Quit fooling around.

288
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:02,677
Now's not the time for stuff like that.

289
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:04,216
Let's take it easy.

290
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:12,885
Light.

291
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:15,668
This is our first date in forever.

292
00:17:15,693 --> 00:17:17,619
Can't you enjoy yourself a little more?

293
00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:24,784
Misa, let's move in together.

294
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:28,062
Do you mean it?

295
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:30,260
Yeah. I've already rented a place.

296
00:17:32,382 --> 00:17:34,704
Yay! Victory is mine!

297
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:35,821
Misa wins!

298
00:17:36,018 --> 00:17:36,918
Victory?

299
00:17:36,943 --> 00:17:38,955
Over Kiyomi, and Mari, and Yuri.

300
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,438
But it's all right now. Don't worry.

301
00:17:41,463 --> 00:17:44,174
I knew you were just using those other girls to trick L.

302
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:46,486
You don't have any reason to see them anymore, right?

303
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:48,415
Right.

304
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:57,088
Hey.

305
00:17:57,113 --> 00:18:00,824
Now that L's dead, does that mean
you've finally settled the score with him?

306
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:02,051
Yeah.

307
00:18:02,704 --> 00:18:06,531
So in that case, I guess things are
gonna get pretty boring from now on.

308
00:18:08,896 --> 00:18:10,770
That's not true, Ryuk.

309
00:18:11,097 --> 00:18:11,761
Huh?

310
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:13,977
From this moment on,

311
00:18:14,987 --> 00:18:18,097
I'll show you the creation of the new world.

312
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:19,651
Ah!

313
00:19:30,248 --> 00:19:31,285
Daddy!

314
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,527
Daddy?

315
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:42,721
Hm?

316
00:19:46,004 --> 00:19:48,240
This will be the rebirth of Yotsuba.

317
00:19:48,265 --> 00:19:50,248
Yeah. It's a new start.

318
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:50,915
Huh?

319
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:53,955
Hey, Namikawa! What's wrong?

320
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,500
That's impossible.

321
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:08,795
In April 2012, Light Yagami, age 23,
joined Japan's National Police Agency.

322
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,625
In the summer of 2012,

323
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,359
Kira's killings increased at an unprecedented rate.

324
00:20:13,649 --> 00:20:16,797
Numerous people around the world were terrified of Kira,

325
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:19,598
and yet, there were just as many cheering him on.

326
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:22,805
Gradually their private thoughts became public opinion,

327
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:26,300
and soon, certain nations
began to accept Kira's judgement.

328
00:20:27,448 --> 00:20:32,491
The world was heading into a dark age
in which Kira's will was the only law.

329
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:12,374
What is it, Roger?

330
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,651
It's L. He's dead.

331
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:37,200
L's death?

332
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:38,607
Where'd they hear it from?

333
00:22:38,756 --> 00:22:39,785
Who told them?

334
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:41,160
Who is this guy?

335
00:22:41,823 --> 00:22:43,090
Is he joking?

336
00:22:44,178 --> 00:22:46,690
What's with this strange feeling?
