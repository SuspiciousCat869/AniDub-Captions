1
00:01:41,103 --> 00:01:43,416
Regarding Naomi Misura's disappearance,

2
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:45,534
shouldn't we open an investigation into this matter?

3
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:48,829
If we do, it should be coordinated
separately from the Kira case.

4
00:01:48,888 --> 00:01:52,000
Also, we'll have to use police
sketches instead of actual photos.

5
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:54,628
We're talking about someone who's
been missing for four months already.

6
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:56,457
Chances are, she's probably dead.

7
00:01:57,353 --> 00:02:01,288
If you're right about that, I find it
odd that we haven't found her body yet.

8
00:02:01,558 --> 00:02:05,027
If we did, it might provide us with
some much needed physical evidence.

9
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:06,857
Ryuzaki.

10
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,333
Hmm?

11
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:10,042
Something seems to be happening on Sakura TV.

12
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:14,969
In other words, all of the reporters
and staff here are Kira's hostages.

13
00:02:14,994 --> 00:02:18,841
Aside from that, we have a professional
obligation to share this message with you.

14
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:20,669
I assure you that this is not a hoax

15
00:02:20,694 --> 00:02:23,053
and that Sakura TV is not airing this tape

16
00:02:23,078 --> 00:02:25,081
for the purposes of sensationalism.

17
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:26,753
Kira's hostages?

18
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,986
What is this?

19
00:02:28,424 --> 00:02:33,097
Four days ago, our program director
here at Sakura TV received four tapes.

20
00:02:33,122 --> 00:02:34,656
After a thorough examination,

21
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:37,199
there could be no doubt that they are from Kira himself.

22
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:42,519
Our audience ratings should go up
60, no, more like 70% after this.

23
00:02:42,702 --> 00:02:45,345
The first tape we received contained a prediction

24
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,689
regarding the time of death of two suspected
criminals who'd recently been arrested.

25
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:53,234
And as predicted, at the exact
time that Kira had specified,

26
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:55,904
both men died suddenly of heart attacks yesterday.

27
00:02:55,929 --> 00:02:57,519
If what they're saying is true,

28
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:00,499
it's clearly something that only Kira could do.

29
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:06,057
Kira has instructed us to air this
second tape today at exactly 5:59 PM.

30
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,433
And we do intend to comply with his demands.

31
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,396
This tape should offer proof of his powers

32
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:12,456
by predicting yet another death.

33
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:17,118
Beyond that, we understand that it contains a
message to all the people of the world from Kira.

34
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,821
This has to be another fake, don't you think?

35
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:20,958
I doubt it.

36
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:23,924
I'm pretty sure even Sakura TV wouldn't stoop that low.

37
00:03:24,156 --> 00:03:25,749
And now, the video.

38
00:03:33,386 --> 00:03:34,624
I am Kira.

39
00:03:34,735 --> 00:03:40,821
If this video was being aired on April
18 at exactly 5:59 PM as I requested,

40
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:45,932
then the time now is 5:59:47, 48, 49.

41
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:48,924
Please change the channel to Taiyou TV.

42
00:03:48,957 --> 00:03:51,556
The news anchor, Mr. Kazuhi Kohibima,

43
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:54,050
will die of a heart attack at exactly 6 o'clock.

44
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:54,628
What?

45
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:55,290
Change it.

46
00:03:58,013 --> 00:03:59,050
It can't be.

47
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:01,351
What happened? He's not moving.

48
00:04:01,861 --> 00:04:03,191
How could he?

49
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:05,714
Change the channel back.

50
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,645
And I need you to bring us another TV, Watari.

51
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,018
No, make it two.

52
00:04:10,098 --> 00:04:10,665
Yes.

53
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,512
This is punishment.

54
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:13,410
I will present you with another victim.

55
00:04:13,435 --> 00:04:18,597
My next target is NHN TV commentator Mr. Saeji Komaizumi,

56
00:04:18,622 --> 00:04:21,269
who is scheduled to appear in a live broadcast.

57
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,129
He too has dared to defy Kira.

58
00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:24,123
Ryuzaki?

59
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:25,825
Change it to channel 24.

60
00:04:26,572 --> 00:04:27,858
Someone help him!

61
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,716
Please change it back.

62
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:32,791
Now that you've seen proof of my powers,

63
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:35,729
you should have no trouble believing that I am Kira.

64
00:04:35,863 --> 00:04:39,769
Kira said that he was going to send
a message to the people of the world.

65
00:04:40,045 --> 00:04:41,820
Stop this broadcast!

66
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:43,365
We can't let him finish!

67
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:46,167
Get Sakura TV on the line!

68
00:04:47,242 --> 00:04:48,187
It's no good.

69
00:04:48,212 --> 00:04:51,327
I'm trying, but none of my contacts
at the station have their phones on.

70
00:04:51,352 --> 00:04:53,531
And nobody's picking up at reception, either.

71
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:55,339
Damn it!

72
00:04:55,644 --> 00:04:56,830
Ah, Ukita

73
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,992
I'll stop this broadcast myself if that's what it takes.

74
00:05:01,263 --> 00:05:03,900
People of the world, please listen to me.

75
00:05:04,044 --> 00:05:06,778
The last thing I want to do is kill the innocent.

76
00:05:06,803 --> 00:05:09,494
I hate evil and love justice.

77
00:05:09,585 --> 00:05:13,095
I've always thought of the
police as allies, not as enemies.

78
00:05:15,396 --> 00:05:16,674
Damn you, Kira.

79
00:05:16,873 --> 00:05:19,067
I intend to create a new world,

80
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:21,585
a perfect world that is free from evil.

81
00:05:21,805 --> 00:05:25,346
If you agree to join me in my
mission, I know we can make it happen.

82
00:05:25,403 --> 00:05:27,709
And as long as no one tries to catch me,

83
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,895
I promise that the innocent will not die.

84
00:05:29,922 --> 00:05:30,973
Come on!

85
00:05:31,406 --> 00:05:33,461
Even if you don't agree with me,

86
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:36,964
all I ask is that you not
publicize your views in the media.

87
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:39,713
If you can do that, you will be spared.

88
00:05:40,044 --> 00:05:42,873
All you have to do now is be patient.

89
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:46,382
I will create a better world that we can all enjoy.

90
00:05:46,592 --> 00:05:48,879
Say goodbye to the world as you know it.

91
00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:51,927
Soon, we'll have a new world ruled by benevolence,

92
00:05:51,963 --> 00:05:55,119
inhabited with kindhearted, honest people.

93
00:05:55,182 --> 00:05:58,162
Try to imagine it, a world where the police and I...

94
00:05:58,473 --> 00:05:59,390
Hmm?

95
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:02,161
Sachiko.

96
00:06:05,463 --> 00:06:08,330
Darling, this can't be good for your health.

97
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,355
Please, you have to rest.

98
00:06:13,413 --> 00:06:18,270
Sachiko, like it or not, I am still
in charge of the Kira task force.

99
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,979
Damn, it's locked!

100
00:06:32,804 --> 00:06:34,154
This is the police!

101
00:06:34,308 --> 00:06:35,122
Open up!

102
00:06:36,074 --> 00:06:38,643
Ah, you... you idiots!

103
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:02,890
Hello? Damn, I'm still not getting through.

104
00:07:04,568 --> 00:07:05,869
Aizawa, look!

105
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:06,600
Huh?

106
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:15,213
As you can see, someone has
collapsed just outside the door.

107
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:18,252
Again, we're coming to you
live from the Sakura TV building.

108
00:07:18,993 --> 00:07:22,688
Ukita, damn it, Kira did this.

109
00:07:24,504 --> 00:07:26,027
Mr. Aizawa.

110
00:07:27,188 --> 00:07:28,607
Where are you going?

111
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:31,212
Where do you think? I've got to go there.

112
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:32,254
You can't.

113
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,056
Please, think about this rationally.

114
00:07:34,314 --> 00:07:37,024
What, you want me to just sit here and watch TV?

115
00:07:37,396 --> 00:07:41,596
If this truly is the work of Kira, you'll
just meet the same fate if you go there.

116
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:45,140
You told us that Kira couldn't kill without a name.

117
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:47,417
So how could this happen?

118
00:07:47,515 --> 00:07:50,178
The aliases and fake police IDs are worthless.

119
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,680
What are we going to do, L?

120
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,031
You don't think Kira has all our names already, do you?

121
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:56,499
That's a definite possibility.

122
00:07:56,986 --> 00:08:00,035
However, if that's the case, you'd
think it would be easier for him to

123
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,857
kill off the entire task force before making a move.

124
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,768
Initially, I deduced that Kira
needed both a name and a face to kill.

125
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:08,662
But from what we've just seen,

126
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:10,640
I'd say it's not entirely impossible that

127
00:08:10,665 --> 00:08:13,062
Kira can kill with only a face.

128
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:17,773
All I know for sure is that
Kira is either in that TV station,

129
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:19,286
or he's somewhere close by,

130
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:22,297
in a place where he can watch
everyone who enters the building.

131
00:08:22,487 --> 00:08:23,298
Perhaps he's in an...

132
00:08:23,323 --> 00:08:27,175
If Kira is in the area, then isn't
that why we should get down there?

133
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:31,123
For all we know, he could have just
placed surveillance cameras in the area.

134
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:33,181
If we rush down there unprepared,

135
00:08:33,206 --> 00:08:34,104
all of us will be killed.

136
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:37,129
Wasn't it you who said we'd have
to risk our lives to catch Kira?

137
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:41,234
I meant what I said, but risking my life to catch Kira

138
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,587
and doing something that I know will cost me my life

139
00:08:43,612 --> 00:08:45,212
are two entirely different things.

140
00:08:45,237 --> 00:08:46,130
Oh yeah?

141
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:52,222
Please control yourself.

142
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:54,375
We've lost Ukita.

143
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:59,379
I understand you want to go there, but
if something was to happen to you as well.

144
00:09:03,254 --> 00:09:05,603
I now await a response from the police.

145
00:09:05,663 --> 00:09:09,559
They must decide whether or not they'll
help me create a better world for all of us.

146
00:09:09,638 --> 00:09:13,037
Please announce your decision on
the 6 o'clock news in four days.

147
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,829
I've prepared two videos,

148
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:18,934
one to be aired if the answer is
yes and another if the answer is no.

149
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:29,095
Huh?

150
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,964
What the hell's going on?

151
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:45,362
Hey, step out of the vehicle!

152
00:09:46,605 --> 00:09:47,205
Huh?

153
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,108
The Kira video.

154
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:51,656
Show me which studio they're broadcasting it from.

155
00:09:51,695 --> 00:09:54,655
A vehicle has just driven through
the front doors of the station.

156
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:59,868
Well, that's one way to get into the
building without being seen by Kira.

157
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,392
But who would...

158
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,663
This is the police. Stop this broadcast immediately.

159
00:10:05,763 --> 00:10:06,826
Who are you?

160
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:08,251
Hand those tapes over to me.

161
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:09,344
Do you understand?

162
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:10,482
Hold on, officer.

163
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:11,593
It's not that simple.

164
00:10:11,618 --> 00:10:12,970
My hands are tied here.

165
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:16,062
If we stop this broadcast, he'll kill all of us.

166
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,107
Shut up.

167
00:10:17,235 --> 00:10:19,016
You're going to be killed right here and now

168
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,600
if you don't give those tapes to me.

169
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,167
What?

170
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,276
Come on, what the hell do you think you're doing?

171
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:25,061
This is crazy.

172
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:38,663
This is happening because you
chose to make Kira a celebrity.

173
00:10:38,893 --> 00:10:41,259
You're getting exactly what you deserve.

174
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:45,316
I want every single copy you have,
and don't make me ask you again.

175
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:46,709
I... I got it.

176
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:47,994
I'll give them to you.

177
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:48,916
No problem.

178
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:50,977
Just please, stop waving that gun around.

179
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:52,953
You're acting like a madman.

180
00:10:54,038 --> 00:10:56,063
We're still outside Sakura TV.

181
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,716
As you can see, a police car has just arrived.

182
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,342
So we're not alone.

183
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:03,758
There are still other officers out
there who are willing to stand up to Kira.

184
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:04,873
Mr. Aizawa.

185
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:05,438
Huh?

186
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,243
You know Deputy Director
Kitamura's cell phone number, right?

187
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:16,573
Aizawa, I told you not to call me on this phone.

188
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,489
This is L.

189
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,837
There's something I need you to do for me.

190
00:11:20,383 --> 00:11:25,614
There may be police officers who will see this broadcast
and feel moved to take action in the name of justice.

191
00:11:25,975 --> 00:11:29,676
If you don't take control of this
situation quickly, there will be a disaster.

192
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:33,267
But technically, we're not
supposed to be involved in this case.

193
00:11:33,428 --> 00:11:34,112
Huh?

194
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:38,874
Two police officers have just collapsed on the sidewalk.

195
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,432
I... I think we may be in danger.

196
00:11:40,457 --> 00:11:42,044
We're moving away from the scene.

197
00:11:43,893 --> 00:11:45,543
I understand, L.

198
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:47,473
I see your point now.

199
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:49,120
Tell me what I should do.

200
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:54,569
Detective Superintendent Yagami.

201
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:57,009
Call him back immediately and give me the phone.

202
00:11:57,335 --> 00:11:59,702
I need to speak with Ryuzaki.

203
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:00,926
Yes, it's me.

204
00:12:00,951 --> 00:12:02,132
Mr. Yagami.

205
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:04,243
So you're the one driving the police van.

206
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:05,216
That's right.

207
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,257
I couldn't just sit and watch.

208
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:09,618
I've confiscated all of the tapes.

209
00:12:09,644 --> 00:12:11,069
I'm bringing them to you.

210
00:12:11,174 --> 00:12:12,732
But what about your condition?

211
00:12:12,757 --> 00:12:13,602
Are you all right?

212
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,207
I'm feeling just fine.

213
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:18,381
To be honest with you, I don't
think I've ever felt more alive.

214
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:20,693
So what do you think I should do now?

215
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,144
I'd say going out the front will be too dangerous,

216
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,708
but I could always use the police van again.

217
00:12:25,894 --> 00:12:27,403
Please hold the line for a second.

218
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:29,191
Deputy Director Kitamura,

219
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:31,979
it was Chief Yagami who just drove into the building.

220
00:12:32,106 --> 00:12:33,437
Are your preparations complete?

221
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:35,252
It's done, as you requested.

222
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:38,212
Mr. Yagami, listen carefully.

223
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:40,836
In exactly five minutes, I want
you to come out the front entrance.

224
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:43,103
You want me to exit through the front entrance?

225
00:13:10,293 --> 00:13:12,151
Make sure there are no gaps.

226
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:14,068
Do not reveal your faces.

227
00:13:14,146 --> 00:13:16,546
We know that Kira is not in the building.

228
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:17,756
He is outside.

229
00:13:30,584 --> 00:13:31,401
Thank you.

230
00:13:32,347 --> 00:13:33,615
I'll drive myself.

231
00:13:34,228 --> 00:13:35,445
I understand.

232
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:43,662
Listen up.

233
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:47,475
There is a very good chance that Kira
is still in the vicinity of the station.

234
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,885
As you move out, proceed with caution.

235
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:51,996
You are not to remove your helmets.

236
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,059
There you have it.

237
00:13:55,108 --> 00:13:57,516
The police refuse to cooperate with Kira.

238
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,389
Instead, they are preparing to fight.

239
00:13:59,432 --> 00:14:02,779
And, as much as I fear for my own life in saying so,

240
00:14:02,831 --> 00:14:04,264
this is right.

241
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,076
And it must be done.

242
00:14:07,131 --> 00:14:10,515
Kira has become a threat to our very constitution.

243
00:14:10,607 --> 00:14:13,663
And as citizens, we must fight back.

244
00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:18,715
I am NHN's Golden News anchor, Koki Tanakabara.

245
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,348
Mm? Chief Yagami!

246
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:22,660
Welcome back, Chief.

247
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,560
Mm.

248
00:14:24,688 --> 00:14:28,945
Ryuzaki, I apologize for taking matters into my own hands.

249
00:14:29,146 --> 00:14:31,737
I have to admit, I got a little bit carried away.

250
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:38,078
Here, these are all of the tapes in an envelope.
Everything Kira sent to the station is in here.

251
00:14:38,358 --> 00:14:39,764
I can't thank you enough.

252
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:42,823
Ah, I think I'd better rest for a minute.

253
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:48,806
Mr. Yagami, this won't go to waste.

254
00:14:49,944 --> 00:14:52,100
The postmark is from Osaka,

255
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:55,548
but Kira can control his victims before they die,

256
00:14:55,573 --> 00:14:59,596
so he could have delivered it from
Osaka without going there himself.

257
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:04,082
Mr. Aizawa, can you please take
this to the crime lab right away?

258
00:15:04,326 --> 00:15:06,326
I still have a couple of friends down there.

259
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:08,358
I'll make sure they go over every inch of this.

260
00:15:08,383 --> 00:15:09,685
That's good. Please do so.

261
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:13,553
While you're doing that, I'm going to watch
these tapes to see if they can tell us anything.

262
00:15:17,822 --> 00:15:19,719
Well, what do you make of these?

263
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:21,714
They were definitely interesting.

264
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:25,793
If the police had said yes and
agreed to cooperate with Kira,

265
00:15:25,818 --> 00:15:27,951
tape number three was supposed to be aired.

266
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:29,980
Tape four if the answer was no.

267
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,030
Tape three covers the terms of cooperation.

268
00:15:33,055 --> 00:15:36,957
Put simply, he's requesting that we
broadcast the names of more criminals.

269
00:15:37,172 --> 00:15:41,905
He seems particularly interested in those who
have assaulted others or those who have somehow hurt

270
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,877
or taken advantage of the weak and defenseless.

271
00:15:45,038 --> 00:15:48,902
Of course, Kira would play the
role of judge in all of this.

272
00:15:49,194 --> 00:15:52,467
Furthermore, as proof that the
police are willing to cooperate,

273
00:15:52,523 --> 00:15:55,478
he wants police officials and L to appear on TV,

274
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:58,998
to make a public announcement
that we plan to cooperate with him.

275
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:00,209
Huh?

276
00:16:00,817 --> 00:16:03,217
He needs us to reveal our faces.

277
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:06,035
That way, he can kill us if
the police do anything suspicious.

278
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,029
In other words, he'll hold our lives as insurance.

279
00:16:09,054 --> 00:16:09,779
I see.

280
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:13,278
So what about the content of the
fourth video if we were to answer no?

281
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:17,027
The wording was different, but he
more or less says the same thing.

282
00:16:17,494 --> 00:16:21,016
Mr. Yagami, it should go without
saying that the answer is no.

283
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:24,206
Please have someone take tape numer four over to Sakura TV

284
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:26,381
and authorize them to broadcast it.

285
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:30,528
I can only say it's a shame that your answer is no.

286
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:33,152
It's clear that the police wish to oppose me.

287
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:35,011
This will not go unpunished.

288
00:16:35,147 --> 00:16:39,875
So I'll start by taking the life of
either the director general of the NPA

289
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:44,203
or the detective known as L, who is
currently leading the investigation against me.

290
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:46,828
The director general or L?

291
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,747
Who will pay the price for your refusal to
cooperate in the creation of a peaceful world?

292
00:16:51,837 --> 00:16:53,748
You have four days to decide.

293
00:17:00,868 --> 00:17:01,528
Hmm.

294
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,641
It looks like I've even got God on my side now.

295
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:10,459
Well, I suppose it's actually a god of death.

296
00:17:10,742 --> 00:17:12,808
Heh, seems like it.

297
00:17:13,127 --> 00:17:16,930
It would appear that another
Shinigami has come to the human world.

298
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:19,497
And somehow, that Shinigami's Death Note

299
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:22,679
has fallen into the hands of someone who agrees with Kira.

300
00:17:22,704 --> 00:17:26,337
And this person most likely has the Shinigami eyes,

301
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,460
which makes him very deadly.

302
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,093
His power to kill surpasses even mine.

303
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:32,811
One thing is for certain.

304
00:17:32,836 --> 00:17:36,831
If I leave things, I'm pretty sure that L
will be finished off within the next four days.

305
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,688
However, I can't forgive this impostor

306
00:17:40,713 --> 00:17:44,298
for the way he's tarnishing Kira's
image with these senseless killings.

307
00:17:44,504 --> 00:17:46,694
Not to mention, if he slips up and gets caught,

308
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:48,153
the Death Note could be discovered.

309
00:17:48,178 --> 00:17:49,645
And that, I cannot allow.

310
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,549
I can't afford to leave him alone for much longer.

311
00:17:54,955 --> 00:17:58,357
Therefore, what needs to happen very soon

312
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,860
is for me to join the task force.

313
00:18:00,931 --> 00:18:04,866
It'll allow me to keep track of L and this fake Kira.

314
00:18:08,484 --> 00:18:11,505
Ryuzaki, I'm afraid it's as you thought.

315
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,178
Several of our member countries have weighed in,

316
00:18:14,203 --> 00:18:17,891
and it seems they are in favor
of having the real L appear on TV.

317
00:18:20,046 --> 00:18:23,268
I think that's the most
appropriate choice, given the options.

318
00:18:23,362 --> 00:18:25,829
Well, we still have three days before it happens.

319
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:28,132
Maybe we can find some countermeasure.

320
00:18:28,212 --> 00:18:30,691
After all this, it would really annoy me...

321
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:35,860
mm, if I'm killed by the first
person to jump on the Kira bandwagon.

322
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:38,147
Ryuzaki, what do you mean by that?

323
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:42,672
That there's a strong possibility that this Kira's a fake.

324
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:46,253
No, we should think of him more as a second Kira.

325
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:47,862
A second Kira?

326
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,586
I... I don't understand. Why
do you think there's a copycat?

327
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:53,758
How did you come to that conclusion?

328
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,909
I looked at the victims he used for
his predictions on tape number one.

329
00:18:58,097 --> 00:19:01,919
Their purpose was to prove to
Sakura TV staff that he is Kira.

330
00:19:02,696 --> 00:19:06,276
Both their names were only reported
in tabloids and daytime talk shows,

331
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:08,277
so they weren't exactly hardened criminals.

332
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,040
The real Kira has no need to prove
himself using such insignificant criminals.

333
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:15,262
But from the perspective Kira,

334
00:19:17,078 --> 00:19:20,799
he'd want to make absolutely certain that
he didn't predict the death of a criminal

335
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:22,875
who could be killed by the real Kira first.

336
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:23,697
Hmm.

337
00:19:23,894 --> 00:19:28,702
Ryuzaki, if you had to put a number on
it, what's the probability of a second Kira?

338
00:19:29,484 --> 00:19:32,688
This time, I'd say it's more than 70%.

339
00:19:33,117 --> 00:19:35,717
I really don't like the way he operates.

340
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:37,260
It's not like Kira.

341
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:38,479
Not like him?

342
00:19:38,741 --> 00:19:42,458
In the past, he has traditionally
avoided killing innocent people,

343
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:44,808
with the exception of those who were trying to catch him.

344
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,508
Anyway, if we can capture one Kira,

345
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:51,226
I think that will provide us with a lot of
insight into how we can find the other one.

346
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:58,251
Mr. Yagami, I'd like your permission to ask
your son to cooperate with us on this investigation.

347
00:19:58,383 --> 00:19:59,194
Huh?

348
00:19:59,271 --> 00:20:03,514
If you want my son to join the task force,
does this mean you no longer suspect him?

349
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:06,742
Well, I can't say that he's been completely cleared,

350
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:09,744
but his deductive abilities
would be invaluable to us right now.

351
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:12,156
So that's what it means.

352
00:20:12,951 --> 00:20:16,508
If my son wants to cooperate with
you, then I have no reason to prevent it.

353
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:18,288
I appreciate that.

354
00:20:18,323 --> 00:20:23,266
However, please don't tell him that we
think this latest Kira might be a fake.

355
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,366
I don't want him to know that yet.

356
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:29,458
We want to make it appear to him
that we're still chasing the same Kira.

357
00:20:29,536 --> 00:20:30,847
Hmm.

358
00:20:35,908 --> 00:20:39,475
Misa, I gave that Death Note to you.

359
00:20:39,526 --> 00:20:42,029
So why not use it for yourself?

360
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:46,294
I am using it for myself

361
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:48,743
because I believe in what Kira is doing.

362
00:20:48,856 --> 00:20:51,522
I want to know what kind of person Kira is.

363
00:20:51,547 --> 00:20:53,710
I want to meet him and talk to him.

364
00:20:53,872 --> 00:20:57,390
That's the only reason I sent
all those videos to that TV station.

365
00:20:57,415 --> 00:21:00,146
I had to find some way to make Kira notice me.

366
00:21:01,322 --> 00:21:03,788
And I'd say that probably got his attention.

367
00:21:03,813 --> 00:21:04,940
Don't you think?

368
00:21:05,317 --> 00:21:07,715
It's a dangerous game you're playing.

369
00:21:07,864 --> 00:21:09,883
There's a chance you could be killed.

370
00:21:09,908 --> 00:21:11,408
Do you understand?

371
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:12,384
It's all right.

372
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:15,125
I'm sure that Kira is kind to those with pure hearts.

373
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:16,582
And if it came down to that,

374
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:18,760
I'm still stronger than he is

375
00:21:18,803 --> 00:21:21,175
because I have the eyes.

376
00:22:37,384 --> 00:22:40,218
I need to figure out what this other Kira is all about

377
00:22:40,336 --> 00:22:43,186
before someone else on the task force beats me to it.

378
00:22:43,273 --> 00:22:48,175
I wonder, what kind of person are you, impostor?
