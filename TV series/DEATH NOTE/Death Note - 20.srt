1
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:31,409
Well, then, let's begin tonight's meeting.

2
00:01:31,934 --> 00:01:34,938
There's supposed to be eight of
them, but only seven are present.

3
00:01:34,963 --> 00:01:36,186
That must mean that...

4
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,221
They probably killed one of their members.

5
00:01:38,246 --> 00:01:39,361
Hmm.

6
00:01:39,386 --> 00:01:44,064
In order to further the growth of the Yotsuba
Group and best serve its financial interests,

7
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:45,946
who should we kill next?

8
00:01:46,704 --> 00:01:49,377
You see? It's just like I told you last week.

9
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:51,806
This is not good. At this rate...

10
00:01:51,913 --> 00:01:55,996
But before we get to that, there are
several topics that we need to discuss.

11
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:58,799
First, there is the issue of Hatori's death.

12
00:01:58,937 --> 00:01:59,981
That was unavoidable.

13
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:04,466
To be honest, in a certain sense,
I'm relieved that Hatori is dead.

14
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:08,265
Kira has demonstrated that we
must be committed to these meetings.

15
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,071
We now know what will happen if we try to leave.

16
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,091
Hmm.

17
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,616
I think we all understand what
Hatori's death means for the rest of us.

18
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:18,564
Let's not take it lightly.

19
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:23,201
Now, moving on, our next topic is Eraldo Coil's report.

20
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:26,743
One of their members just died,
and that's all they're going to say?

21
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,926
So did we really pay $5 million for this report?

22
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:36,186
I mean, come on. Look at this.

23
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:40,137
He hasn't found out anything important
about L, like his name or his face.

24
00:02:40,182 --> 00:02:43,157
Is this Coil guy seriously going to be of any use to us?

25
00:02:43,222 --> 00:02:44,422
Hold on a second.

26
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:48,538
There is something very interesting
in the last part of this report.

27
00:02:48,563 --> 00:02:52,675
Coil's warning us that we can't
afford to take L's existence too lightly.

28
00:02:52,746 --> 00:02:55,809
In particular, it says, the concentration of killings

29
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:59,213
that are beneficial to Yotsuba will likely be noticed by L

30
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:02,030
if they continue on Fridays and Saturdays.

31
00:03:06,373 --> 00:03:09,798
Sounds like this Eraldo Coil has
figured out what we've been up to.

32
00:03:09,953 --> 00:03:11,634
I admit, it's quite impressive.

33
00:03:12,145 --> 00:03:15,798
At any rate, I personally think we
should stop killing every weekend.

34
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:17,831
This is unbelievable.

35
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:20,713
It's like they're trying to confess to everything.

36
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:21,672
Hmm.

37
00:03:21,707 --> 00:03:25,900
As long as we have this video as evidence,
we could probably arrest all seven of them.

38
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:28,244
This is not good.

39
00:03:28,363 --> 00:03:31,281
Kira hasn't been flexible up till now, has he?

40
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:34,667
It would be nice if he could spread
out his killings over the whole week.

41
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:40,684
The fact that Coil noticed what we've been up to makes
it too dangerous to continue killing at our usual pace.

42
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:42,904
From now on, we have to be even more careful

43
00:03:42,929 --> 00:03:46,341
and make sure that nobody else happens
to notice a trend in these deaths.

44
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,536
Now, onto the main topic.

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,400
Who should we kill?

46
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:53,521
Hmm.

47
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:58,239
I think we should focus on ELF Insurance.

48
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:00,362
If they expand into the Japanese market,

49
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:03,825
Yotsuba and many other companies
will lose valuable clients to them.

50
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:05,167
Agreed.

51
00:04:05,682 --> 00:04:06,371
All right.

52
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:10,263
Any objections to killing these
people from ELF with accidental deaths?

53
00:04:10,288 --> 00:04:11,655
No objections.

54
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,235
Oh.

55
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,559
Is this for real?

56
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:15,526
How can they do this so easily?

57
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:20,471
Another potential candidate is Santero
Zenzai, a member of the Kugisawa Group.

58
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,073
He's been protesting Yotsuba's resort development plans.

59
00:04:24,158 --> 00:04:26,329
Zenzai's known to have high blood pressure,

60
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:30,215
so we can designate a time for him to
suffer a stroke, resulting in natural death.

61
00:04:30,356 --> 00:04:31,429
Any objections?

62
00:04:31,468 --> 00:04:32,966
No objections.

63
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,240
Kira? Deaths by accident, by disease?

64
00:04:36,265 --> 00:04:38,008
Designated times of death?

65
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:40,701
It's all just as we suspected.

66
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:41,915
We were right.

67
00:04:42,372 --> 00:04:44,144
Now, unfortunately,

68
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:48,271
we can only be completely sure after
those people they've named are dead.

69
00:04:48,943 --> 00:04:49,472
Ah.

70
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:53,870
We will continue to monitor these meetings
and take note of what they say, how they act,

71
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:57,056
and, most importantly, whether
the people they choose actually die.

72
00:04:57,428 --> 00:05:00,945
If we can confirm the connection
between their plans and the deaths,

73
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:03,899
then we'll definitely be able to catch Kira.

74
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:04,931
Ryuzaki!

75
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:07,293
Ah, mm... what is it?

76
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:09,043
There's no need to yell in unison.

77
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:11,605
I can't carry on knowing these people will die.

78
00:05:11,726 --> 00:05:13,020
That's just immoral.

79
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:13,566
Right.

80
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:15,130
Here it comes.

81
00:05:15,183 --> 00:05:19,359
I know you're planning to catch Kira by letting
these guys actually carry out these murders,

82
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:21,666
but we can't let that happen.

83
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,856
That's right.

84
00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:25,625
It's obvious that these seven men are behind the killings.

85
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:29,087
With Matsuda's testimony and this footage we've recorded,

86
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:30,621
we have all the evidence.

87
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,263
You're making this difficult.

88
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,853
If we were to take action now,
everything we've done will go to waste.

89
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:42,017
So what do you say we take care of the ELF in three weeks.

90
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:45,515
And as for Zenzai, we'll ask
Kira to kill him this weekend.

91
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:47,032
No objections.

92
00:05:47,057 --> 00:05:50,258
If that's what they're going to
do, then there's not much time left.

93
00:05:50,745 --> 00:05:54,066
Light, we already know the phone
numbers of these board members, don't we?

94
00:05:54,342 --> 00:05:54,934
Yeah.

95
00:05:55,435 --> 00:05:57,051
I don't care who we call.

96
00:05:57,103 --> 00:06:00,269
I need to reach one of these men
and have them stop these murders.

97
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:01,405
Please, hold on.

98
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:03,907
That will cause suspicion.

99
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:07,486
It would mean the investigation
caught up to them three days

100
00:06:07,511 --> 00:06:09,583
after they were contacted by Aiber.

101
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:13,161
Also, it would make it far more unlikely

102
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:16,433
that we would be able to
discover who the real Kira might be.

103
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:19,926
We can't afford such a huge
setback, seeing how far we've come.

104
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:25,920
In order to catch Kira,

105
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,484
we are going to need some solid proof.

106
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,758
Ryuzaki, if one of these seven men is in fact Kira,

107
00:06:36,783 --> 00:06:39,483
would it be safe to say that if I try calling one of them,

108
00:06:39,508 --> 00:06:43,109
the odds of that person actually
being Kira is going to be one in seven?

109
00:06:43,224 --> 00:06:46,217
I'm thinking there could be more than one Kira among them,

110
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,786
a probability of two in seven at most.

111
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:52,770
If we're prepared to let them know that
the investigation is catching up to them,

112
00:06:53,305 --> 00:06:55,409
let's place our bets on these odds.

113
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:58,617
Ryuzaki, I'm going to pose as L.

114
00:06:58,722 --> 00:07:01,049
Judging from their conversation so far,

115
00:07:01,074 --> 00:07:04,385
the one least likely to be Kira
but with the most influence is...

116
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:05,328
Ooi!

117
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:06,296
Namikawa.

118
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:07,625
Uh...

119
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,126
If you're going to make a call, please use this phone.

120
00:07:10,283 --> 00:07:12,753
It's set up so it can't be traced or tapped.

121
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,662
You know, this would all go a lot faster

122
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,746
if we'd kill off the execs of our
rival companies and be done with it.

123
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:22,962
That would be going a little too far.

124
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:23,625
Why?

125
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,544
We can kill them and split their holdings.

126
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:29,391
Is this Reiji Namikawa, head of the
Yotsuba Group's marketing department?

127
00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:30,339
Hmm.

128
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:32,566
Yes. And who is this?

129
00:07:32,928 --> 00:07:36,039
Listen carefully, but don't draw attention to yourself.

130
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:37,796
I am L.

131
00:07:41,276 --> 00:07:44,443
I've placed cameras and wiretaps
throughout that meeting room.

132
00:07:44,468 --> 00:07:47,685
Even as I speak, I'm recording
footage of your entire meeting.

133
00:07:47,886 --> 00:07:50,647
The first thing you discussed was Hatori's death.

134
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:53,748
Now you're debating who to kill next.

135
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:55,552
Am I correct?

136
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,800
He's been watching everything.

137
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,782
If you're not Kira,

138
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:03,254
or if you are not someone who can contact Kira directly,

139
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,040
let's make a deal.

140
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:06,237
A deal?

141
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:12,079
I need you to delay the deaths of ELF's
president and Mr. Zenzai by one month.

142
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:15,745
I doubt it will be difficult for someone
of your standing to accomplish that.

143
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:17,880
Yes. Yes, I see.

144
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,861
Right. Uh, go on.

145
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:23,923
If you complete your end of the deal and
cooperate with our requests from now on,

146
00:08:23,948 --> 00:08:26,025
then your crimes... no, not just yours,

147
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,191
but everyone's crimes, with the
exception of Kira's will be pardoned,

148
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:33,350
based on the premised that Kira blackmailed
you into participating in these meetings.

149
00:08:33,395 --> 00:08:35,222
I see. OK.

150
00:08:35,858 --> 00:08:37,753
My only option is to join L.

151
00:08:37,854 --> 00:08:40,741
No, I'll be dead if Kira manages to find out.

152
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:41,976
What should I do?

153
00:08:42,585 --> 00:08:45,672
If you tell the others about this call, they will panic.

154
00:08:45,743 --> 00:08:47,667
It would be of no advantage to you.

155
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:50,072
Everyone would be arrested immediately.

156
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,864
But that's not my intention.

157
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:54,354
I'm planning to go one on one against Kira.

158
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:55,805
Listen.

159
00:08:55,977 --> 00:08:59,121
If I win against Kira, you
will be acquitted of all charges.

160
00:08:59,146 --> 00:09:03,011
If Kira wins, then you'll be free to
carry on with your comfortable life.

161
00:09:03,382 --> 00:09:05,465
Just play along with both parties.

162
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,751
Staying on the sidelines would be best.

163
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:12,593
You're not in a position to lose
anything, regardless of who wins in the end.

164
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:17,273
You would only be at a loss if I
decided to arrest you right here and now.

165
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,108
Damn it.

166
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,333
He already knew what answer I would have given.

167
00:09:21,992 --> 00:09:23,024
That's all for now.

168
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:24,905
Right. I'll see you Monday then.

169
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,175
What's going on, Namikawa? Who was that?

170
00:09:29,973 --> 00:09:33,405
Oh, one of my men screwed up
again. I'll have to fix it on Monday.

171
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,853
Anyway, sorry for the interruption.

172
00:09:35,878 --> 00:09:37,400
Let's get back on topic.

173
00:09:38,152 --> 00:09:42,434
We were discussing when we should
kill Zenzai and the men from ELF.

174
00:09:43,006 --> 00:09:44,340
Here's what I'm thinking.

175
00:09:44,426 --> 00:09:47,487
We'll give Coil one month to reveal L's identity.

176
00:09:47,782 --> 00:09:52,719
If he still hasn't uncovered the information we
need, then we can go ahead and kill the targets randomly.

177
00:09:52,937 --> 00:09:57,147
Then we'll give him another month
to investigate and repeat the process.

178
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,958
Once we get rid of L permanently, we can go
back to killing two or three people a week.

179
00:10:02,157 --> 00:10:06,235
In other words, our top priority
should be the elimination of L.

180
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:07,337
I see.

181
00:10:07,803 --> 00:10:10,665
Once we kill L, there won't
be anything standing in our way.

182
00:10:11,348 --> 00:10:13,317
But until then, we need to be careful.

183
00:10:13,342 --> 00:10:14,002
Right.

184
00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:15,988
Sounds like a reasonable plan to me.

185
00:10:16,143 --> 00:10:19,768
We need to be extremely careful
if we don't want to get caught.

186
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:21,139
Then we're in agreement.

187
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:22,819
We'll give Coil one month.

188
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,054
Agreed.

189
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:28,167
L, this should satisfy you for now.

190
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:30,794
We will still be meeting on a weekly basis.

191
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:31,529
That is all.

192
00:10:31,941 --> 00:10:32,825
That went well.

193
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:34,213
Yeah.

194
00:10:34,472 --> 00:10:36,781
You really are quite amazing, Light.

195
00:10:37,082 --> 00:10:39,700
Not only did you manage to delay the killings,

196
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:43,008
but you also set up Namikawa as a potential mole for us.

197
00:10:43,534 --> 00:10:48,185
It sounded exactly like the sort of thing I
would do, and you thought of it quicker than I did.

198
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,575
At this rate,

199
00:10:52,613 --> 00:10:54,988
if I end up dying somehow,

200
00:10:55,013 --> 00:10:58,401
it's quite possible that you
would be capable of succeeding me.

201
00:10:58,426 --> 00:11:00,657
What? Why are you being so morbid?

202
00:11:01,091 --> 00:11:02,515
There isn't time for that.

203
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,566
We only have a month to figure out Kira's
identity and gather evidence against him to prove it.

204
00:11:06,591 --> 00:11:08,046
This is only the beginning.

205
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:14,148
Yes, but you were the one who first noticed
the connection between Yotsuba and Kira.

206
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,614
You actually might be more capable than I am.

207
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:19,722
I honestly believe you could take this on.

208
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:23,892
Tell me, If I should die,

209
00:11:24,748 --> 00:11:26,576
would you take over for me as L?

210
00:11:43,514 --> 00:11:46,741
If I should die, would you take over for me as L?

211
00:11:49,547 --> 00:11:53,572
If he is Kira and just playing
innocent, he's sure to say yes.

212
00:11:53,866 --> 00:11:55,308
What are you talking about?

213
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:59,230
As long as we're joined by
these, we would die together anyway.

214
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:02,547
I see.

215
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,928
Ryuzaki, I'm sorry,

216
00:12:06,171 --> 00:12:09,887
but I'm going to have to tell everyone
what you're really thinking right now.

217
00:12:10,142 --> 00:12:13,481
He thinks that if I am Kira,
then there are two possibilities.

218
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:17,339
Either I'm just pretending I'm not
him and putting on an act or Kira's power

219
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,563
has passed on from me to someone else,

220
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:22,821
and I have no memory that I
was ever Kira in the first place.

221
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:25,707
He's trying to determine which, if either, is the truth.

222
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:29,676
The first theory... if I am putting on an act,

223
00:12:29,766 --> 00:12:32,243
he will never remove these handcuffs.

224
00:12:32,712 --> 00:12:35,508
No, even if I wasn't pretending to be innocent,

225
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:37,460
I'm sure he still wouldn't take them off.

226
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,994
Ryuzaki still believes that I'm Kira.

227
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,796
Even if that power had been passed to someone else,

228
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:47,381
he thinks that I would have planned to have
it return to my once I'm safe from suspicion.

229
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:51,395
In other words, I wasn't being controlled at all.

230
00:12:51,728 --> 00:12:53,569
He thinks it was a plan...

231
00:12:53,594 --> 00:12:57,309
to pass on the power and arrange for it
to come back to me once I've been cleared.

232
00:12:57,561 --> 00:12:58,722
Impressive.

233
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:02,252
He figured out exactly what
I'd been thinking all this time.

234
00:13:02,747 --> 00:13:05,913
Ryuzaki's theory is that once I steal L's title,

235
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:07,908
I will become Kira again.

236
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:09,876
Correct.

237
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:12,561
Taking on the identity of L,

238
00:13:12,756 --> 00:13:15,323
having the power to control the police in every country

239
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:18,898
while being Kira in secret... it's ideal.

240
00:13:19,824 --> 00:13:21,626
And you're thinking I could do it.

241
00:13:21,982 --> 00:13:23,878
No, that I would do it.

242
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,500
That's what you're saying, isn't it?

243
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:26,815
Yes.

244
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:28,805
But what about now?

245
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,646
I told you, I don't want your title.

246
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:33,815
That should prove even to you that
I'm not putting on an act, shouldn't it?

247
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:38,816
If this is all an act, and you
are trying to steal my identity,

248
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:42,628
there's no chance you would be foolish
enough to reveal your plan in front of everyone.

249
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:43,840
Wouldn't you agree?

250
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:44,634
Hmm.

251
00:13:44,843 --> 00:13:45,894
Ryuzaki.

252
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:48,374
Huh?

253
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:52,941
Do you think that I'm actually
capable of becoming a murderer?

254
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,130
Kira?

255
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:56,778
Even after I help you catch him?

256
00:13:57,686 --> 00:13:59,748
Do I seem like that kind of person to you?

257
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:06,457
Yes, you do.

258
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:07,917
I've always thought so.

259
00:14:10,103 --> 00:14:10,875
Hmm.

260
00:14:15,738 --> 00:14:17,167
Gah, not again.

261
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,367
OK, break it up! Once is enough.

262
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:22,564
It was a draw, so let's just
leave it as an even match, OK?

263
00:14:23,091 --> 00:14:24,105
Yeah, you're right.

264
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:28,168
Anyway, let's focus on catching the
Kira that's in front of us right now.

265
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:31,328
As long as I have the handcuffs
on, you shouldn't have any complaints.

266
00:14:31,353 --> 00:14:32,423
I suppose so.

267
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:34,833
We only have a month, so
there's no time to get distracted.

268
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:37,570
Ryuzaki.

269
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:38,409
Yes?

270
00:14:38,757 --> 00:14:40,956
We have plenty of footage from this meeting.

271
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:45,292
Can we use that as evidence against those seven
men and prevent the murders of other criminals?

272
00:14:45,547 --> 00:14:47,201
Here we go again.

273
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,167
Unfortunately, no.

274
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:50,019
But why?

275
00:14:50,044 --> 00:14:53,346
At the moment, we're not certain
if Kira is among those seven men.

276
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,934
If all they have is a tenuous connection with him,

277
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:58,522
then Kira will kill them as soon as they're arrested.

278
00:14:58,904 --> 00:15:03,805
We have to be absolutely sure that Kira is among
them, so there's no point in detaining them now.

279
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:05,948
And even if it does turn out to be one of them,

280
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:09,319
it will still be quite difficult
to determine who the culprit is.

281
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:12,707
Mm, I believe it's still far
too early for us to make our move.

282
00:15:13,315 --> 00:15:14,104
Hold on.

283
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,152
At the same time, we can't say that
he's definitely not among the seven.

284
00:15:17,341 --> 00:15:19,468
That means there's a chance the killings will stop

285
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:21,508
if we take this opportunity to arrest them.

286
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,292
I think Dad's right. There is a chance.

287
00:15:24,473 --> 00:15:25,814
We have to act on it.

288
00:15:26,024 --> 00:15:27,649
Excuse me, but...

289
00:15:27,866 --> 00:15:30,964
I think from now on, I should go after Kira by myself.

290
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:31,559
Huh?

291
00:15:31,857 --> 00:15:34,152
You can use these headquarters as you wish.

292
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:37,081
I'll also be here, but we will be working independently.

293
00:15:37,176 --> 00:15:39,821
You can conduct your investigation
under your own direction.

294
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:42,037
Feel free to arrest those men if you like.

295
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:44,404
I will be carrying on my own investigation.

296
00:15:44,429 --> 00:15:48,053
We'll only get into arguments if we don't
split up and act separately at this point.

297
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:49,544
This is for the best.

298
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:53,328
Are you saying you're going to figure
out who Kira is by any means necessary?

299
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:54,529
Yes.

300
00:15:54,848 --> 00:15:58,391
This case will never be solved
unless we capture Kira himself.

301
00:15:58,511 --> 00:15:59,444
Don't get me wrong.

302
00:15:59,469 --> 00:16:01,967
I wouldn't say that preventing more deaths is pointless.

303
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:07,086
But if we don't uncover the entire truth once and for all,

304
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:11,683
Kira will only appear again, and the
number of victims will continue to increase.

305
00:16:11,892 --> 00:16:16,285
That's why I believe it's more
important to find out who Kira really is.

306
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,928
As I've been saying, I'm opposed
to arresting those seven men.

307
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,496
If you want to do so, then you will
have to take responsibility for them.

308
00:16:23,646 --> 00:16:25,751
I will pursue Kira on my own.

309
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,793
We only have one month.

310
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:30,765
I wonder who will succeed?

311
00:16:31,243 --> 00:16:33,835
R... Ryuzaki. Where are you going?

312
00:16:33,966 --> 00:16:35,147
To Amane's room.

313
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:37,582
Sorry, I know you're on your father's side in all this,

314
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:39,688
but I can't remove these handcuffs.

315
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:41,699
I'm afraid you're going to have to come along with me.

316
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,827
Light! I didn't know we were supposed to have a date.

317
00:16:53,852 --> 00:16:55,245
Oh, right, I should have known.

318
00:16:56,028 --> 00:16:57,188
Misa Amane...

319
00:16:57,575 --> 00:17:00,196
Tell me, do you love Light from the bottom of your heart?

320
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:00,899
Huh?

321
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:02,349
Uh, yeah.

322
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:03,645
Of course I do.

323
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,842
But you also worship Kira, don't you?

324
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,254
Well, yeah.

325
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:10,113
So then, if you had to choose between Light and Kira,

326
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:11,038
who would you pick?

327
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:11,727
What?

328
00:17:11,872 --> 00:17:14,193
That's obvious. Of course it's gonna be Light.

329
00:17:14,252 --> 00:17:18,616
I'm really grateful to Kira and want to meet
him someday in person, but that's not true love.

330
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:20,269
I'd definitely choose Light.

331
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:22,913
But your precious Light is planning to catch Kira.

332
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,979
Isn't that right?

333
00:17:25,196 --> 00:17:26,747
Well, yes, of course I am.

334
00:17:27,117 --> 00:17:28,862
He says he wants to catch Kira.

335
00:17:28,908 --> 00:17:30,508
Now what will you do?

336
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:34,254
Well, if that's what Light says, then
I'm gonna support him no matter what.

337
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:35,328
I see.

338
00:17:35,395 --> 00:17:39,262
So if you were given the opportunity
to work with Light on this investigation,

339
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:40,327
would you take the offer?

340
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:41,284
What? Ryuzaki...

341
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:42,938
Yeah, of course I would.

342
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:44,767
I'd do anything I could to help Light.

343
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:47,247
Wait, hold on a second. Where are you going with this?

344
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,678
I'm planning to have Aiber pose as Eraldo Coil again.

345
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:53,599
He'll tell the Yotsuba members
that while he was investigating L,

346
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,695
he discovered that Misa Amane might know who he is.

347
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,028
He'll also tell them that L brought her in for questioning

348
00:17:59,053 --> 00:18:01,482
on suspicion that she was the second Kira.

349
00:18:01,507 --> 00:18:03,125
That part is true.

350
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,917
If the Yotsuba Group believe that
Misa could be their lead to finding L,

351
00:18:07,181 --> 00:18:10,752
then they'll say that they want to meet
her to discuss their advertising campagin.

352
00:18:10,777 --> 00:18:13,278
They'll use that opportunity to question her.

353
00:18:13,422 --> 00:18:14,889
Thanks to Matsuda's screw-up,

354
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:18,987
they may already be considering Misa as
their new spokesperson, so this could work.

355
00:18:19,012 --> 00:18:20,120
Yeah, right.

356
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:21,635
We can't do that.

357
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:22,634
Why not?

358
00:18:22,752 --> 00:18:23,963
This plan is too risky.

359
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:25,553
Who knows what could happen to you?

360
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:28,481
Oh, wow! Does that mean you're worried about me?

361
00:18:28,544 --> 00:18:29,751
Yay!

362
00:18:30,756 --> 00:18:31,673
But don't worry.

363
00:18:31,698 --> 00:18:34,382
I won't mind doing something
like this if it's for you, Light.

364
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,014
Listen, Misa.

365
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:38,797
If they suspect that you might know who L really is,

366
00:18:38,822 --> 00:18:41,880
we don't know how far they'll be
willing to go to get that information.

367
00:18:42,028 --> 00:18:43,475
No problemo.

368
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,859
I promise I won't say anything, even if they torture me.

369
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,732
I can attest to that.

370
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:51,015
But Kira can control his
victims' actions before their death.

371
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:52,805
There's a good chance he might try to

372
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,338
manipulate her into revealing
what she knows and then kill her.

373
00:18:55,363 --> 00:18:59,222
Also, if he does manage to kill
L, he won't have any use for Misa.

374
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:00,633
He'd kill her to keep her silent.

375
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:02,504
Uh, I don't like the sound of that.

376
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:03,232
Light.

377
00:19:03,257 --> 00:19:03,754
Hmm?

378
00:19:04,785 --> 00:19:07,803
You forget that if we win against Kira, Misa won't die.

379
00:19:08,138 --> 00:19:12,615
Besides, as long as we're handcuffed
together, you and I share the same fate.

380
00:19:13,914 --> 00:19:15,639
If I die, so will you.

381
00:19:16,978 --> 00:19:20,196
If that happens, Misa is the
one who would grieve most of all.

382
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,274
Either we lose and both die together,

383
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:24,046
or we successfully catch Kira.

384
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,174
Which is it?

385
00:19:25,337 --> 00:19:26,637
We catch Kira!

386
00:19:26,702 --> 00:19:29,325
I would never dream about living in a world without Light.

387
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,405
Yes, that would be dark.

388
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,414
Cut it out! This is just crazy.

389
00:19:32,498 --> 00:19:35,197
We're running out of time, and
I'm starting to get desperate.

390
00:19:35,414 --> 00:19:36,974
As for Misa Amane,

391
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,213
I've turned to her because I know her
bravery and love for you is boundless.

392
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:44,253
Do you really mean it?

393
00:19:44,928 --> 00:19:48,853
Oh no, I think I've totally
misunderstood you all this time.

394
00:19:48,894 --> 00:19:50,731
I even called you a pervert.

395
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,788
But you actually do understand how I feel, don't you?

396
00:19:54,188 --> 00:19:55,019
Yes.

397
00:19:55,181 --> 00:19:59,277
Misa is indisputably the most
perfect and worthy woman for Light.

398
00:19:59,302 --> 00:20:00,735
Yay!

399
00:20:01,026 --> 00:20:03,483
You're such a sweetie. Thank you, Ryuzaki.

400
00:20:03,561 --> 00:20:05,176
I could actually fall for you.

401
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:07,296
Let's not go that far.

402
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,566
But you could maybe be a friend of mine.

403
00:20:09,632 --> 00:20:10,699
Would that be OK?

404
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,048
Yes.

405
00:20:12,073 --> 00:20:14,326
So now I've gained yet another friend.

406
00:20:14,484 --> 00:20:18,396
Yeah. Of course, any friend of
Light is a friend of mine as well.

407
00:20:20,545 --> 00:20:22,762
Let's all be friends together.

408
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,692
Yay, fun, huh.

409
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:28,186
And of course, I would never
think of betraying any of my friends.

410
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:30,795
With our powers combined, we'll arrest Kira.

411
00:20:31,134 --> 00:20:35,010
Unfortunately, Light's taking a
different investigative approach from us

412
00:20:35,062 --> 00:20:37,204
and will be working with his father and the others.

413
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:37,751
Hmm?

414
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:39,622
I'm afraid it will just be you and I.

415
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,295
Huh? What's up with that?

416
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,619
Come on, L. Now you're just playing dirty.

417
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:46,278
You're leaving me with no other choice but to join your...

418
00:20:46,303 --> 00:20:47,549
No, that's quite all right.

419
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,558
What are you talking about? Of course he'll be joining us.

420
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:51,893
That's not it either.

421
00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:54,628
I've been opposed to this
investigation since the beginning.

422
00:20:54,746 --> 00:20:56,346
It's too dangerous for her!

423
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:58,660
Oh, Light. You're so sweet.

424
00:20:58,695 --> 00:21:00,441
Thank you for worrying about me.

425
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:02,089
But please let me do this.

426
00:21:02,114 --> 00:21:04,402
I want to be useful to you somehow.

427
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:07,908
If I can be useful, then maybe you'll love me even more.

428
00:21:08,521 --> 00:21:12,471
And besides, I would gladly die if it were for you, Light.

429
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:16,456
Figuring out the logistics of arresting
seven people is going to be challenging.

430
00:21:16,588 --> 00:21:20,664
I don't suppose you two have any ideas. Mogi? Matsuda?

431
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:38,235
Well, I am an actress.

432
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,830
Director Nishinaka, Light, and
the others, and now even Shinigami.

433
00:22:41,855 --> 00:22:43,435
They're all asking me to act.

434
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,827
This is a lot of work.

435
00:22:44,852 --> 00:22:48,846
I might land a commercial gig, too. I'm so popular.
