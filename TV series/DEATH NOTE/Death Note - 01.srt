1
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:08,651
What?

2
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:11,081
A pair of sleeping skulls?

3
00:02:12,274 --> 00:02:13,481
I win again.

4
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,398
No hard feelings, right?

5
00:02:15,554 --> 00:02:18,597
Hey there, Ryuk, would it kill you to join us?

6
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:21,339
You should come play with us for a change.

7
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:26,430
No, I'll pass.

8
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:30,889
Listen for the voice of God, then follow it.

9
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,872
And know that in time, you will find your salvation.

10
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:34,780
I didn't do anything wrong.

11
00:02:34,814 --> 00:02:35,996
He just totally snapped at me.

12
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:37,133
Really? So what did he say?

13
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:38,803
Yagami, are you still with us?

14
00:02:39,672 --> 00:02:42,656
Can you please translate the
following sentence into English?

15
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:49,168
"Follow the teachings of God and receive his blessings.

16
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,907
And so it shall be that the
seas will again become bountiful

17
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:56,053
and the raging storms will subside."

18
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:58,859
Today, at approximately 11:00 AM,

19
00:02:58,884 --> 00:03:02,252
a 32 years old man was found
stabbed to death in his apartment

20
00:03:02,277 --> 00:03:05,362
in the city of Yokohama Kanagawa Prefecture.

21
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:08,361
Kanagawa police are treating this case as homicide.

22
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:09,514
In other news.

23
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:11,873
Today, suspected murderer, Naoki Tokuji

24
00:03:11,898 --> 00:03:14,598
was arrested in the district of Shibuya, Tokyo.

25
00:03:14,932 --> 00:03:19,835
He is being held in custody, facing murder charges
for the brutal slaying of his common-law partner,

26
00:03:19,946 --> 00:03:22,442
who was only 25 at the time of her death.

27
00:03:24,526 --> 00:03:26,708
Day in and day out,

28
00:03:27,871 --> 00:03:30,600
the same news on permanent repeat.

29
00:03:31,831 --> 00:03:35,624
This is all so ridiculous.

30
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:38,122
This world is...

31
00:03:38,224 --> 00:03:39,671
rotten.

32
00:03:43,402 --> 00:03:47,526
Another noticeable consequence is the
extinction of many species on the planet.

33
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:48,346
No way.

34
00:03:48,514 --> 00:03:49,200
You paged...

35
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:55,319
Species are now becoming extinct at a faster
rate than has ever occurred in our record history.

36
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:30,919
"Death Note"?

37
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:33,469
As in a notebook of death?

38
00:04:34,313 --> 00:04:35,121
Hm.

39
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,620
"How to use it.

40
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:43,456
The human whose name is written
in this notebook shall die."

41
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:45,207
Hm.

42
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:51,254
It's pretty lame, not to mention twisted.

43
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,735
It's really not that different from
one of those chain letter you get.

44
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:58,532
"The human whose name is written
in this notebook shall die"?

45
00:04:59,006 --> 00:04:59,978
Come on.

46
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:12,029
There must be something wrong with me to even consider it.

47
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:17,853
"This note will not take effect unless the writer has

48
00:05:17,878 --> 00:05:21,025
the person's face in their
mind when writing his or her name.

49
00:05:21,252 --> 00:05:24,850
Therefore, people sharing the
same name will not be affected.

50
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:30,273
If the cause of death is written within 40
seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.

51
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:34,971
If the cause of death is not specified,
the person will simply die of a heart attack.

52
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:40,978
After writing the cause of death, details of the death
should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds."

53
00:05:42,197 --> 00:05:42,714
Hm.

54
00:05:42,962 --> 00:05:47,080
So depending on the person you have in mind,
you can either kill them easily or painfully, huh?

55
00:05:47,428 --> 00:05:50,314
This is pretty detailed for a prank, I'll give them that.

56
00:05:57,806 --> 00:06:01,081
So I write a name and that person dies.

57
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,699
Like anyone would believe that.

58
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,924
Wait, on the off chance someone really dies,

59
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:24,625
would that make me a murderer?

60
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,282
Hm, yeah, right, it's completely impossible.

61
00:06:30,147 --> 00:06:35,061
The same assailant who attacked six people at a busy
shopping district in Shinjuku yesterday has struck again,

62
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:37,591
taking eight people hostage at this daycare center.

63
00:06:37,636 --> 00:06:40,234
His captives include both children and teachers.

64
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:42,263
The police have now identified the suspect as

65
00:06:42,288 --> 00:06:45,779
42 years old Kurou Otoharada, currently unemployed.

66
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:48,288
We expect negotiations to begin immediately.

67
00:06:50,882 --> 00:06:55,159
Hm, a heart attack in 40 seconds,

68
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,079
we'll see.

69
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,502
At the present time, that's all the police are telling us.

70
00:07:00,604 --> 00:07:03,762
You can't help but feel concerned
for the safety of those hostages.

71
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:05,313
You're absolutely right.

72
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:07,730
We'll continue to monitor the situation from here.

73
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:09,460
Thank you for that report.

74
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,612
What do you make of this, Mr. Hashimoto?

75
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,654
Well, one can only hope for a
quick resolution to this situation.

76
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:18,893
Looks like the notebook doesn't work.

77
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:22,012
Oh, well, I didn't expect it to anyway.

78
00:07:22,914 --> 00:07:24,755
Wait, we're seeing something here.

79
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,771
Looks like movement at the front entrance.

80
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,378
The hostages are coming out.

81
00:07:28,453 --> 00:07:29,905
And they all looked to be unharmed.

82
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:31,750
The Special Forces are taking action.

83
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:32,741
They're moving in.

84
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:34,955
We don't know if the suspect's been arrested.

85
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:35,997
Huh? Yes?

86
00:07:36,217 --> 00:07:38,291
OK, we now have confirmation.

87
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:40,415
The suspect has been found dead inside.

88
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:42,969
I repeat, the suspect is now dead.

89
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:43,722
Dead?

90
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:49,647
The Special Forces are denying
allegations that they shot the suspect.

91
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:53,768
So it's quite possible he was feeling
cornered and decided to commit suicide?

92
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:57,457
Well, according to statements from the
hostages, the suspect has suddenly collapsed.

93
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:00,038
A heart attack?

94
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,303
No way.

95
00:08:03,895 --> 00:08:05,199
It's coincidence.

96
00:08:05,648 --> 00:08:07,549
This has to be a coincidence.

97
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:08,571
Light!

98
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:11,902
It's already 6:30, you know?

99
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:13,933
Don't you have cram school tonight?

100
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:16,368
Yeah, I'll be ready in just a sec.

101
00:08:17,827 --> 00:08:18,885
Death Note.

102
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:22,320
It's unlikely, but if by chance this thing is for real...

103
00:08:22,756 --> 00:08:24,589
I have to test it one more time.

104
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:27,629
In which case, it should probably be another criminal.

105
00:08:27,928 --> 00:08:31,004
But if he's too well known, that could be a problem.

106
00:08:31,422 --> 00:08:35,453
If he dies, there's a good possibility
that news of his death will be covered up.

107
00:08:36,513 --> 00:08:38,606
I need to see results right away.

108
00:08:39,088 --> 00:08:40,523
Hey, Ryo, buddy.

109
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:42,265
What is it, Sudo?

110
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:44,831
Didn't you want to lend me $20?

111
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:46,267
Hm, huh, again?

112
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:46,978
But I can't do that.

113
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:49,694
Sudo, maybe I should try killing him.

114
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:53,643
No, I should definitely avoid killing people I know.

115
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:57,384
And again, does it even really matter?

116
00:08:57,723 --> 00:09:01,571
I mean, would anyone really care if a
guy like him was to disappear one day?

117
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,115
Sweet!

118
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,604
Looks like we'll be hanging at the arcade after school.

119
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:08,273
Do you know?

120
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,199
We're having a speed dating party tomorrow,

121
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:10,960
you want to come?

122
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:11,892
Yeah, of course.

123
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:13,591
Oh, there's no way I'm missing that.

124
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:16,240
Damn it! Why is my mother so useless?

125
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,455
She's never here to pick me up on time!

126
00:09:19,161 --> 00:09:21,280
Once you actually start looking around,

127
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:26,476
it makes you wonder if you'd be doing society
a favor by getting rid of all these people.

128
00:09:28,874 --> 00:09:31,891
Hey, baby, where are you going?

129
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,795
Come have a little fun with us!

130
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,994
That's our Takuo for you.

131
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:36,956
This guy could spot a hottie a mile away.

132
00:09:37,122 --> 00:09:38,567
What's up, little lady?

133
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:40,953
The name is Takuo Shibuimaru.

134
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:42,173
What do you say?

135
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:44,265
Come hang out with us, pretty lady!

136
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:46,304
Please, I don't want any trouble.

137
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:48,275
You hear that? She doesn't want trouble.

138
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,134
Whoo, isn't that cute?

139
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:51,005
Ha-ha!

140
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:54,404
Ungh. Agh. No!

141
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:56,820
Let's go, boys, strip her down right here.

142
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:58,054
Wha... are you sure?

143
00:09:58,088 --> 00:09:58,701
Hahaha!

144
00:09:58,725 --> 00:10:00,146
No, stop!

145
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:02,088
Please!

146
00:10:02,247 --> 00:10:04,316
Help me!

147
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,279
Now, what will happen?

148
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,426
No!

149
00:10:12,641 --> 00:10:13,369
No!

150
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:15,033
Hey, wait up!

151
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,457
Takuo, look out!

152
00:10:22,766 --> 00:10:25,379
That, uh, that settles it.

153
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:28,590
The Death Note, it's for real.

154
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:30,651
Oh, man, Takuo!

155
00:10:30,683 --> 00:10:31,519
Stupid kid.

156
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:33,234
He just came out of nowhere.

157
00:10:33,662 --> 00:10:34,669
Aargh!

158
00:10:37,194 --> 00:10:40,477
Now then, I better get going.

159
00:10:53,802 --> 00:10:55,743
It's been five days.

160
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,570
Now then, I better get going.

161
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:02,041
Ah? You headed somewhere, Ryuk?

162
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,465
Hate to tell you, but our whole world looks like this.

163
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:09,690
That's true. But I've dropped my Death Note.

164
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,470
You really messed things up, didn't you?

165
00:11:13,544 --> 00:11:14,439
Hold on a sec.

166
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:17,562
Didn't you already trick the Old Man to get a second book?

167
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:19,437
Don't tell me you dropped both of them?

168
00:11:19,725 --> 00:11:22,713
You must have some idea where you dropped the thing?

169
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:25,498
Yeah, the human world.

170
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:26,436
What?

171
00:11:55,403 --> 00:11:56,880
What a nice surprise!

172
00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:59,028
I wasn't expecting you home so early.

173
00:11:59,053 --> 00:11:59,716
Yeah.

174
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:01,721
Hi, Mom.

175
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:03,737
It's because, uh, huh?

176
00:12:05,528 --> 00:12:08,451
Oh, the results of the nationwide exams.

177
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:09,847
I've been waiting all day.

178
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,713
Here.

179
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:14,311
Goodness! Number 1 again!

180
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:16,451
These are the highest scores you've had.

181
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:17,750
Yeah, I guess.

182
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:18,876
I'm going to study in my room.

183
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:20,532
So please don't interrupt me, OK?

184
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,797
As you wish.

185
00:12:22,194 --> 00:12:25,351
Oh, Light, do you want anything at all, dear?

186
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:26,957
You can ask for whatever you like.

187
00:12:26,982 --> 00:12:28,315
No, I'm fine, Mom.

188
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,161
Thanks, though.

189
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:33,913
I've already got what I want.

190
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,812
You've taken quite a liking to it.

191
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,542
Aah!

192
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,990
No reason to act surprised.

193
00:13:05,336 --> 00:13:07,124
I am the Shinigami Ryuk.

194
00:13:07,355 --> 00:13:09,176
That used to be my notebook.

195
00:13:09,786 --> 00:13:11,168
Judging by your laughter,

196
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:15,251
you've already figured out that
what you have is no ordinary notebook.

197
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,026
Shinigami, a god of death, huh?

198
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:28,586
Well, I'm not surprised.

199
00:13:28,623 --> 00:13:34,656
In fact, Ryuk, I've been waiting for you.

200
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,048
Oh?

201
00:13:37,003 --> 00:13:40,016
I've already figured out that
this Death Note I found is real.

202
00:13:40,349 --> 00:13:41,612
It didn't take me long.

203
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:44,226
And now that I've witnessed the proof of its power,

204
00:13:44,508 --> 00:13:47,473
I only feel more confident in what I'm going to do.

205
00:13:47,883 --> 00:13:49,023
That's interesting.

206
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:51,996
I certainly wasn't expecting this.

207
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:55,970
Several Death Notes have made their
way into the human world in the past,

208
00:13:55,995 --> 00:13:58,643
but you're the first to have written this many names.

209
00:13:59,023 --> 00:14:02,556
Look at how many people you've killed in only five days.

210
00:14:02,644 --> 00:14:05,065
Most are reluctant to write this much.

211
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,743
I've already prepared myself, Ryuk.

212
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:11,239
I used the notebook even though
I knew it belonged to a Shinigami.

213
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:13,285
And now, that Shinigami has come.

214
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:15,170
So what will happen to me?

215
00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:17,378
You're here to take my soul, right?

216
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:19,254
Hm? What do you mean?

217
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,706
Is that some fantasy you humans came up with?

218
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:25,522
I'm not going to do anything to you.

219
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:26,413
Huh?

220
00:14:27,061 --> 00:14:31,653
The notebook becomes part of the human
realm from the very moment it touches the earth.

221
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,050
In other words, the notebook is now yours.

222
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:37,499
This is mine?

223
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:40,396
If you don't want it, just give it to someone else.

224
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,222
But if you give it away, I'd have no choice
but to erase your memories of the notebook.

225
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:50,179
So then, you're saying I can use to Death
Note all I want, and I won't be punished?

226
00:14:50,414 --> 00:14:51,932
Let's just say this.

227
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:56,858
You will feel the fear and pain known
only to humans who have used the notebook.

228
00:14:58,361 --> 00:15:00,381
And when it's your time to die,

229
00:15:00,548 --> 00:15:04,115
it will fall on me to write your name in my Death Note.

230
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,438
Be warned, any human who's used the Death Note

231
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,876
can neither go to heaven nor hell for eternity.

232
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:14,376
That's all.

233
00:15:19,327 --> 00:15:23,048
Now, you have something to look forward to after you die.

234
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:26,525
Light?

235
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:28,208
It'll be all right.

236
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:29,312
Answer it.

237
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:32,868
What is it?

238
00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:34,530
I thought you'd like some apples.

239
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:36,645
The neighbors brought them over for us.

240
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:39,300
Why on earth is it so dark in your room?

241
00:15:39,553 --> 00:15:40,828
You'll ruin your eyesight.

242
00:15:40,853 --> 00:15:41,906
What's going on?

243
00:15:42,486 --> 00:15:43,884
Mom can't see him?

244
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,694
That notebook you found originally belonged to me.

245
00:15:49,826 --> 00:15:51,569
And since you're now using it,

246
00:15:51,594 --> 00:15:53,922
you are the only one who is able to see me.

247
00:15:54,048 --> 00:15:57,397
And of course, my voice can only be heard by you.

248
00:15:57,554 --> 00:16:03,252
In other words, the Death Note is the bond
between Light, the human, and Ryuk, the Shinigami.

249
00:16:04,182 --> 00:16:06,461
Mm, mm.

250
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:08,179
Yum.

251
00:16:08,204 --> 00:16:10,412
I just have one more question I want to ask you.

252
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:12,756
Why was I chosen for this?

253
00:16:14,177 --> 00:16:15,879
Hey, are you even listening?

254
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:21,086
Apples in the human world are worth the trip.

255
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:23,422
What's the best way to describe these?

256
00:16:23,997 --> 00:16:24,946
Juicy?

257
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,547
Just answer my question.

258
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,601
Hah, I didn't choose you.

259
00:16:28,991 --> 00:16:31,374
Don't you see this is all just an accident?

260
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:35,036
You actually thought you were chosen
because you're so smart or something?

261
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:36,709
Don't be so vain.

262
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:41,038
It just happened to fall around here,
and you just happened to pick it up.

263
00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:42,591
And that's all there is to it.

264
00:16:42,842 --> 00:16:44,978
That's why I wrote the instructions in English,

265
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,414
the most popular language in the human world.

266
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,553
Then why did you drop it in the first place?

267
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,843
You even wrote down specific instructions!

268
00:16:51,868 --> 00:16:54,177
So don't try to tell me this was an accident.

269
00:16:54,553 --> 00:16:56,054
You're asking me why?

270
00:16:56,978 --> 00:16:58,976
I did it because I was bored.

271
00:17:00,091 --> 00:17:01,353
You were bored?

272
00:17:03,045 --> 00:17:06,463
The truth is, Shinigami haven't got much to do these days.

273
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:09,513
Most of the time, we're either taking naps or gambling.

274
00:17:09,893 --> 00:17:15,073
If you take the time to write names in your Death
Note, the others just laugh at you for working so hard.

275
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:20,060
Even if you wrote the name of another Shinigami,
it would be pointless because they wouldn't I die.

276
00:17:20,136 --> 00:17:22,236
Then since we live in the Shinigami realm,

277
00:17:22,261 --> 00:17:25,984
it brings us no amusement to kill
those in the human world either.

278
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:30,880
So I figured I'd have more fun if I get down here myself.

279
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:36,241
Anyway, I'm surprised at how many names you've written.

280
00:17:36,313 --> 00:17:40,732
But I want to know why you only wrote the cause
of death for that guy who was hit by the truck.

281
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:44,377
If you don't write down the cause of
death, the victim dies of a heart attack.

282
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:47,997
And that's probably the best
thing about the Death Note, Ryuk.

283
00:17:48,036 --> 00:17:48,638
Huh?

284
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:53,035
You see, I've already exhausted the
list of the world's major criminals.

285
00:17:53,357 --> 00:17:55,461
And eventually, I'm going to get rid of them all.

286
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:57,721
What's the point of doing that?

287
00:17:57,857 --> 00:18:02,391
It's only a matter of time before people figure out
that these criminals are being eliminated by someone.

288
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,330
I want the world to know of my existence,

289
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:10,065
that there's someone out there
passing righteous judgment on the wicked.

290
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:12,926
Why even bother?

291
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:15,956
What are you trying to achieve
by passing judgment on them?

292
00:18:16,274 --> 00:18:18,030
I mean, why do you care?

293
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,985
Because I've been bored, too.

294
00:18:24,758 --> 00:18:26,922
I wasn't ready to believe it at first,

295
00:18:27,028 --> 00:18:28,423
but it's obvious now.

296
00:18:28,545 --> 00:18:32,701
There's something about the Death Note itself
that makes humans want to try it out at least once.

297
00:18:35,475 --> 00:18:36,680
I killed them both.

298
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:39,470
I real... I'd killed two men.

299
00:18:40,257 --> 00:18:41,724
Those were human lives.

300
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:43,503
It won't be overlooked.

301
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:47,572
Besides, who am I to pass judgment on others?

302
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:49,410
Uhh,

303
00:18:52,177 --> 00:18:54,344
no, no, wait. Maybe I'm wrong.

304
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,114
This is exactly what I've been thinking about lately.

305
00:18:57,318 --> 00:18:58,521
This world is rotting.

306
00:18:58,813 --> 00:19:01,428
And those who are making it rot deserve to die!

307
00:19:01,861 --> 00:19:03,952
Someone has to do it, so why not me?

308
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:07,226
Even if it means sacrificing my own mind and soul,

309
00:19:07,251 --> 00:19:11,828
it's worth it because the world can't go on like this.

310
00:19:13,526 --> 00:19:17,390
I wonder, what if someone else
had picked up this notebook?

311
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,995
Is there anyone out there, other than me, who'd
be willing to eliminate the vermin from the world?

312
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:24,365
If I don't do it, then who will?

313
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,271
That's just it. There's no one.

314
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,929
I can do it.

315
00:19:28,398 --> 00:19:31,663
In fact, I'm the only one who can.

316
00:19:32,142 --> 00:19:33,186
I'll do it.

317
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:36,900
Using the Death Note, I'll change the world.

318
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:43,880
Ugh!

319
00:19:45,897 --> 00:19:47,134
Arrgh! Ugh!

320
00:19:51,492 --> 00:19:52,012
Uhh.

321
00:19:52,078 --> 00:19:52,678
Uhh.

322
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:53,651
Ugh!

323
00:19:57,474 --> 00:19:58,765
Ugh!

324
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:06,109
Arrgh!

325
00:20:14,268 --> 00:20:17,337
At first, I wrote the names of
the worst criminals I could think of,

326
00:20:17,462 --> 00:20:20,270
like I was cleaning up the world, one name at a time

327
00:20:20,537 --> 00:20:24,187
so that, eventually, no one
will ever do anything evil again.

328
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:29,193
And while the truly guilty ones who deserve to
be punished for their crimes die of heart attacks,

329
00:20:29,368 --> 00:20:32,233
the people who are less guilty
but who still make trouble for others

330
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:35,409
will slowly be erased through
disease and accidental death.

331
00:20:35,841 --> 00:20:39,875
Then and only then, the world will
start moving in the right direction.

332
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:41,436
It'll be a new world,

333
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:46,828
free of injustice and populated by people who
I've judged to be honest, kind, and hardworking.

334
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:51,096
But if you did that, it would
make you the only bad person left.

335
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:54,421
Huh? I have no idea what you're talking about.

336
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:59,447
I'm a hardworking honor student who's
considered to be one of Japan's best and brightest.

337
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:02,433
And I...

338
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:06,791
I will become the GOD of this new world.

339
00:21:10,131 --> 00:21:12,292
It's just as I thought.

340
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:15,284
Humans are so interesting.

341
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:43,598
I'll show the world what happens when you try to cross me.

342
00:22:44,093 --> 00:22:48,628
The entire world is watching now, L.
