1
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:37,325
Near, it's all taken care of.

2
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:39,234
I did exactly as you asked.

3
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:40,485
Good.

4
00:04:00,512 --> 00:04:03,256
T, that is all I have to tell you today.

5
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:04,412
We'll talk soon.

6
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:06,609
Very well, I understand.

7
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:08,877
I also have a message for you.

8
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:10,756
Yes? What is it?

9
00:04:11,204 --> 00:04:12,690
I've confirmed it.

10
00:04:22,627 --> 00:04:24,103
Hm? You got a text?

11
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,040
Oh, it says she wants to see you.

12
00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:30,780
Man, I'm so jealous. Huh?

13
00:04:31,283 --> 00:04:32,913
I've done it.

14
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:35,494
That's the sign of confirmation from Mikami.

15
00:04:35,605 --> 00:04:39,809
Now all I have to do is wait for
Near to request a meeting face to face.

16
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:42,437
Game over, Near. I win.

17
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,245
I knew what your move would be from the very beginning.

18
00:04:46,694 --> 00:04:48,128
Sir, this is Giovanni.

19
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:50,727
I've been checking the Notebook regularly as you ordered.

20
00:04:50,752 --> 00:04:55,937
For the past three days, he's continued filling out
one page every night, after midnight, as he usually does.

21
00:04:56,113 --> 00:05:00,102
The victims still match up, and there's
been no change in Mikami's behavior otherwise.

22
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,231
I understand.

23
00:05:03,198 --> 00:05:05,361
Well, then let's begin.

24
00:05:12,327 --> 00:05:13,808
Oh! It's Near.

25
00:05:14,116 --> 00:05:15,137
He called.

26
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,545
L?

27
00:05:16,905 --> 00:05:18,994
Yes, this is L. What is it, Near?

28
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:20,700
I want to meet you.

29
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:22,289
What?

30
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:25,637
There's something I must show
you pertaining to the Kira case.

31
00:05:26,872 --> 00:05:30,005
But don't you suspect me of being Kira?

32
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,867
Do you really think it's wise to reveal your face to me?

33
00:05:33,128 --> 00:05:34,033
That's true.

34
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:36,620
I cannot show you unless I reveal my face.

35
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,082
Furthermore, the very act of
showing my face will prove something.

36
00:05:40,177 --> 00:05:42,360
And that will bring this case to a close.

37
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:44,196
All right, fine.

38
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:48,595
As far as I'm concerned, the sooner you
realize you're wrong about me, the better.

39
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,136
The time has finally come for
Near to prove that Light is Kira.

40
00:05:53,238 --> 00:05:54,965
But on the other hand, if that's true,

41
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,467
this will be a chance for Light to kill Near.

42
00:05:57,593 --> 00:05:59,305
It all comes down to this.

43
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:01,867
I'd like to lay out some ground rules for the meeting.

44
00:06:01,892 --> 00:06:04,170
We're willing to go along with whatever you want.

45
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:10,477
First, I want to have all the
investigators from both teams be present.

46
00:06:10,502 --> 00:06:15,104
In other words, everyone who is chasing after Kira
should be gathered together to take part in the meeting.

47
00:06:15,806 --> 00:06:17,897
I understand. That's not a problem.

48
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:21,931
As I mentioned before, there are
a total of four members in the SPK.

49
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,781
That's including myself. All of us will be there.

50
00:06:25,138 --> 00:06:29,350
Besides our team, we'll also bring along
Mr. Mogi, who is currently staying with us.

51
00:06:30,204 --> 00:06:33,338
As for Misa Amane, she will be
released right before we meet.

52
00:06:33,363 --> 00:06:35,239
She'll not be told where we're going.

53
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,197
You can come and meet us once you
confirm that she's been safely released.

54
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,814
Is that acceptable?

55
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:42,204
What do we do?

56
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:43,483
Hmm.

57
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,302
OK, Near. I understand.

58
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:48,150
I have a team of five investigators, including myself.

59
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:50,376
Of course, Mogi's with you at the moment.

60
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:52,849
So aside from me, they'll there'll be only three people.

61
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:54,641
Very well, that's fine.

62
00:06:54,772 --> 00:06:56,854
Now, as for our meeting place...

63
00:07:01,594 --> 00:07:03,058
Daikoku Wharf.

64
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,480
There's a warehouse on the outskirts of the southeast side

65
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:07,202
that's been abandoned for some time.

66
00:07:07,405 --> 00:07:09,175
It's known as the Yellow Box.

67
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:12,398
I've already taken the liberty of purchasing it.

68
00:07:12,423 --> 00:07:15,433
If this arrangement is fine with you, then we'll use it.

69
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:17,632
How about it, Light Yagami?

70
00:07:17,657 --> 00:07:20,793
With a location like this, you
can do what you're planning to do.

71
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:22,497
One more thing,

72
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:24,534
this meeting cannot take place

73
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:27,140
unless I have your word that
someone will bring the Notebook.

74
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:29,560
Wait. Why the Notebook?

75
00:07:29,585 --> 00:07:30,852
It's quite simple.

76
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:33,827
If your entire team leaves HQ to meet me,

77
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:36,336
there will be no one left behind to guard the Notebook.

78
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:40,121
I can promise you this I will
make no attempts to steal it.

79
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:42,816
In fact, I won't even try to touch it.

80
00:07:42,982 --> 00:07:45,016
As long as Mr. Aizawa can confirm

81
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,343
that it's the genuine Notebook,

82
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:48,899
I'm willing to place my faith in you and accept his word.

83
00:07:48,924 --> 00:07:49,610
Huh?

84
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,237
All right.

85
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:54,848
However, I do insist that
someone other than L hold onto it.

86
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:58,500
My reasons for making that request
should be fairly obvious to you.

87
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,283
Right, I understand.

88
00:08:00,537 --> 00:08:02,714
But I'll be the one who decides who will hold onto it.

89
00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:03,881
Does that sound fair?

90
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:05,571
Yes, of course.

91
00:08:05,683 --> 00:08:08,302
Then all that's left to arrange is the time and date.

92
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:09,941
Right. The question is.

93
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:10,899
What time?

94
00:08:11,683 --> 00:08:14,173
Mikami makes his judgments after midnight.

95
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:17,834
He most likely receives a notice in
the morning of which people to kill next.

96
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:20,443
If we take his movements into consideration,

97
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:26,999
say, three days from now on the 28th at 1 PM.

98
00:08:27,127 --> 00:08:28,529
O'clock, huh?

99
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:31,237
That's the exact time I expected him to pick.

100
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:34,261
Near is obviously aware of Mikami's movements.

101
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,207
That's fine by me.

102
00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:38,693
The time doesn't really concern us.

103
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,360
Well then, 1 o'clock, three days from now.

104
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:43,131
Sure.

105
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,650
Near.

106
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:47,946
Light Yagami.

107
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:50,655
I know exactly what your plan is,

108
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:52,792
and I am going to win.

109
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:02,326
Kiyomi, I'm sorry, but I'm a
little busier than usual today.

110
00:09:02,383 --> 00:09:03,449
Oh, really?

111
00:09:03,605 --> 00:09:05,531
Does that mean you can't stay until morning?

112
00:09:05,771 --> 00:09:07,420
Yeah, I'm sorry.

113
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:10,603
Police are going to have their
hands for the next two or three days.

114
00:09:11,238 --> 00:09:12,181
That's a shame.

115
00:09:14,193 --> 00:09:14,647
Hm?

116
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:20,016
I've already given orders to both
Mikami and Takada about what to do.

117
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:23,833
This will be the final order to kill Near.

118
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:17,938
Quick. This way.

119
00:10:17,963 --> 00:10:19,147
Are you all right?

120
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:19,769
Yes.

121
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:22,159
They're getting away. After them.

122
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,107
We need to get inside NHN now.

123
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:27,966
Don't do it take a look around.

124
00:10:28,283 --> 00:10:29,717
It's not safe for her here.

125
00:10:29,816 --> 00:10:31,111
Not even inside.

126
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:32,467
Mello!

127
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:35,599
It's best if you get her away from here right now.

128
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:37,488
Miss Takada, get on.

129
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:39,519
Now.

130
00:10:40,138 --> 00:10:42,083
It's OK, you'll be safe with him.

131
00:10:42,272 --> 00:10:43,647
Please, you have to go.

132
00:10:43,672 --> 00:10:44,436
Right.

133
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:52,690
Team A and Team B, stay on that bike's tail and

134
00:10:52,715 --> 00:10:53,978
don't lose sight of them.

135
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:56,997
As for the rest of you, I need you to find that assailant.

136
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:09,274
All right, we've confirmed Miss Takada's safety.

137
00:11:09,382 --> 00:11:11,007
Let's get her into Car number 7.

138
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:19,784
What the hell?

139
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:21,157
No, he's taking her.

140
00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:22,599
Damn it.

141
00:11:23,505 --> 00:11:24,511
Stop, you idiot.

142
00:11:24,536 --> 00:11:25,518
You can't do that.

143
00:11:25,543 --> 00:11:26,998
What if it ends up hitting her?

144
00:11:29,182 --> 00:11:31,097
Wh... What are you doing?

145
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:51,729
One of the attackers was heavily armed.

146
00:11:52,154 --> 00:11:57,047
As of this moment, both Miss Takada's escort team
and the police are hot on the tail of the suspects.

147
00:11:57,255 --> 00:11:59,595
Oh, man. This is really bad.

148
00:11:59,798 --> 00:12:01,208
Is it Near again?

149
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,374
Near.

150
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,406
You promised that we'd meet in three days time.

151
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:06,367
What's the meaning of making a move like this now?

152
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,624
It doesn't make sense.

153
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:09,988
No, this isn't Near's style.

154
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:11,372
It's more like...

155
00:12:12,288 --> 00:12:13,255
It's Near.

156
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:35,615
So those cars got ahead of me, huh?

157
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,588
How many damn body guards does one woman need, anyway?

158
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:45,359
Hey, come on, give me a break.

159
00:12:45,622 --> 00:12:48,767
Since when were the Japanese
allowed to carry around such big guns?

160
00:12:48,887 --> 00:12:49,845
You got me.

161
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,045
I'm part of this whole kidnapping incident.

162
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,635
That means you'll have a lot of questions to ask.

163
00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:56,421
You won't shoot...

164
00:13:09,075 --> 00:13:10,139
What an idiot.

165
00:13:10,432 --> 00:13:12,841
He probably wouldn't have told us anything, anyway.

166
00:13:13,098 --> 00:13:16,218
And death is the only way to pay for crimes against Kira.

167
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:24,324
This man...

168
00:13:24,561 --> 00:13:29,013
he's the person that Light warned
me to be extra careful of Mello,

169
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:31,504
Mihael Keehl.

170
00:14:01,522 --> 00:14:04,719
Take off everything you're
wearing and put it all in that box.

171
00:14:10,677 --> 00:14:11,596
Hurry up.

172
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,373
You can use this blanket.

173
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:22,782
L, I am not the one who kidnapped Takada.

174
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:24,690
Is that so?

175
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:27,203
Then it has to be Mello.

176
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:28,871
Yes, that's right.

177
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,888
And I have to be honest with you on this

178
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:33,432
we had one of our members escorting Takada,

179
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:36,882
and they confirmed it Mello was the one who abducted her.

180
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:41,568
I apologize for letting this happen
while one of us was guarding her.

181
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:45,515
Near, isn't there any way for you to contact Mello?

182
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,204
No, I'm afraid that would be impossible.

183
00:14:48,295 --> 00:14:52,789
While I do have a method of getting in touch with
him, there's no way he'd respond in the current situation.

184
00:14:56,377 --> 00:14:58,138
Bbefore I take off the rest,

185
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,733
could I please have the blanket
so I can wrap it around me?

186
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,060
Whatever you want.

187
00:15:30,544 --> 00:15:34,206
Our latest report is that the escort team
was forced to shoot one of the perpetrators.

188
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:37,806
They are also still making efforts
to track Miss Takada's whereabouts.

189
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,434
Were you able to get a hold of her?

190
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:41,051
Not yet.

191
00:15:41,076 --> 00:15:42,677
Takada's phone has been turned off.

192
00:15:42,702 --> 00:15:44,353
Mello must have confiscated it.

193
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:45,779
Damn it.

194
00:15:45,854 --> 00:15:47,688
I need to get in touch with Takada.

195
00:15:47,766 --> 00:15:51,078
With no way of getting a hold
of her, all I can do is wait.

196
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,961
This is the only thing that can be done.

197
00:16:24,177 --> 00:16:25,341
If I don't do it...

198
00:16:25,366 --> 00:16:27,727
As for the suspect who was gunned down earlier,

199
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:29,476
we're still not able to identify him.

200
00:16:29,843 --> 00:16:31,524
The police are tracking the remaining suspects...

201
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:34,405
Matt. I never thought you'd be killed.

202
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:37,016
I'm sorry.

203
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,220
Light's cell phone.

204
00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:55,078
Could it be her?

205
00:16:55,103 --> 00:16:56,405
Quiet, everyone.

206
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:58,183
Hello?

207
00:16:59,392 --> 00:17:01,762
Light? I...

208
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:02,784
Miss Takada?

209
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:05,419
Listen to me. Are you all right?

210
00:17:06,232 --> 00:17:09,001
The only reason she'd be able to
call me like this without getting caught

211
00:17:09,026 --> 00:17:11,826
is if she had an opportunity to get away from Mello.

212
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:12,681
Or...

213
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,001
Light, Light, please save me.

214
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:17,101
It's all right.

215
00:17:17,126 --> 00:17:19,332
Calm down and answer my questions, OK?

216
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,457
Oh, OK.

217
00:17:22,463 --> 00:17:25,257
First, your location. Do you know where you are?

218
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:26,554
N... No.

219
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,496
No, I don't know where I am.

220
00:17:28,604 --> 00:17:32,410
I was put into a truck that was locked from the outside.

221
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:34,489
But we were on the freeway,

222
00:17:34,514 --> 00:17:37,853
and I caught a glimpse of the sign
that said we were heading to Nagano.

223
00:17:38,243 --> 00:17:40,762
Right now, I think we're parked
inside of a building somewhere.

224
00:17:40,787 --> 00:17:43,306
Miss Takada, you are Kira's spokesperson.

225
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:47,691
Do you remember the conversation we had
when I told you that there might be people

226
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:49,607
who would try to hurt you because of that?

227
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:51,784
Y... Yes, I remember.

228
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:56,663
We talked what you should do if
a situation like this ever arose.

229
00:17:56,838 --> 00:17:58,105
Do you remember that?

230
00:17:58,366 --> 00:17:59,871
Ah, I remember.

231
00:18:00,576 --> 00:18:02,557
I did what you told me to, Light.

232
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:03,785
I did it.

233
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:05,671
Yes.

234
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:09,716
I didn't struggle, even when he stripped me naked.

235
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:11,667
I did exactly as you said.

236
00:18:11,865 --> 00:18:14,487
I made survival my first priority, and...

237
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:17,512
...and, I did it.

238
00:18:21,198 --> 00:18:22,587
Please, Light.

239
00:18:23,077 --> 00:18:25,094
I did everything that you told me to.

240
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:26,597
Come quickly.

241
00:18:26,744 --> 00:18:27,668
Save me.

242
00:18:27,693 --> 00:18:32,490
Miss Takada, you remember what I
told you to do after that, don't you?

243
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:36,858
I have to do as many killings
as possible while I still can.

244
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,518
I... I know, but... but Light.

245
00:18:40,543 --> 00:18:41,576
Can you do it?

246
00:18:48,187 --> 00:18:49,555
I can do it.

247
00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:59,044
Aizawa, Ide, let's get going.

248
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:01,709
Matsuda, you stay here and take care of headquarters.

249
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:02,723
You got it.

250
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:14,920
It's me.

251
00:19:15,307 --> 00:19:18,182
Send me as many names of people to punish as you can.

252
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:19,586
Here's my email address.

253
00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:21,699
Yes, right. I understand.

254
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,410
If Takada is calling me like this,

255
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:27,011
it must mean that she's been able to kill her kidnappers,

256
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:31,489
in which case, the only certainty is that
she's in a situation where she can't move.

257
00:19:33,532 --> 00:19:36,766
Nakajima, I'm going to the
scene of the crime for this case.

258
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:37,803
OK.

259
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:42,021
All right, I got the location by tracing the call.

260
00:19:42,046 --> 00:19:44,040
Head to Karuizawa by freeway.

261
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:45,348
Karuizawa, huh?

262
00:19:45,521 --> 00:19:47,977
Damn. It'll take at least 30 minutes to get there.

263
00:19:48,002 --> 00:19:50,582
Well, hurry. This is Mello we're talking about.

264
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:51,900
Who knows what he'll do?

265
00:19:52,197 --> 00:19:52,999
Got it.

266
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,620
I don't believe this Aizawa and Ide are just too stupid.

267
00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:03,470
They jumped the gun and got in the
front seats without even thinking.

268
00:20:03,729 --> 00:20:05,306
This is just too easy.

269
00:20:50,174 --> 00:20:53,130
Ah, no Mello.

270
00:20:54,996 --> 00:20:56,636
What the hell is this?

271
00:21:03,718 --> 00:21:06,440
Kiyomi Takada suicide.

272
00:21:07,096 --> 00:21:12,279
January 26, 2013, 2:32 PM.

273
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,441
Burns to death by setting fire to everything around her

274
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,756
including everything she wrote on.

275
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:40,327
Looks like this is the end,

276
00:22:40,352 --> 00:22:43,032
no, more like the beginning

277
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:45,054
the perfect world of Kira.

278
00:22:45,174 --> 00:22:47,513
And those who know of the Notebook's existence

279
00:22:47,543 --> 00:22:50,319
all of them will die.
