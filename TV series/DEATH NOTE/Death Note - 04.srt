1
00:01:26,797 --> 00:01:27,523
What?

2
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,688
I don't believe this.

3
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,375
Another 23 victims yesterday?

4
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,397
Are these confirmed?

5
00:01:32,437 --> 00:01:35,932
As soon as we began to suspect
that Kira might be a student,

6
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:37,757
the pacing of the killings changed,

7
00:01:37,782 --> 00:01:39,326
as if to contradict that theory.

8
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:43,011
This can only mean that Kira
has access to police information.

9
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,976
When L discovers that I'm somehow
getting confidential information,

10
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:50,007
he'll be obligated to start investigating
the police to find the source of the leak.

11
00:01:50,054 --> 00:01:52,174
You're being followed by another human.

12
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:53,794
He's watching you right now.

13
00:01:54,337 --> 00:01:55,437
That's a problem.

14
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:58,853
I'll have to get rid of him as soon as possible.

15
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:03,679
Because through a Shinigami's eyes, a
human's name can be seen above their head.

16
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:06,462
Not only that we see their lifespan as well.

17
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:10,548
However, if a Shinigami drops his
Death Note and a human picks it up,

18
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:13,974
he can grant that human the eyes of a Shinigami.

19
00:02:14,607 --> 00:02:19,811
The price for having a Shinigami's eyes
is half of that person's remaining lifespan.

20
00:02:19,984 --> 00:02:21,272
That's all it is.

21
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,005
So what'll it be, Light?

22
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:26,277
Is it a deal?

23
00:02:29,757 --> 00:02:32,239
Has anyone seen Ryuk around lately?

24
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,251
Maybe he was serious about losing his Death Note.

25
00:02:35,276 --> 00:02:38,380
It was probably picked up by some
human before he could get to it.

26
00:02:38,413 --> 00:02:39,386
No way.

27
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:43,876
Then he'd be stuck there till the end of that
human's life or until the Death Note was destroyed.

28
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:45,330
That could take a while.

29
00:02:45,355 --> 00:02:45,888
Yeah.

30
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,297
I can't picture Ryuk doing something so boring.

31
00:02:49,322 --> 00:02:50,288
But do you know what?

32
00:02:50,313 --> 00:02:53,716
I actually heard he was carrying two Death Notes.

33
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:54,672
Seriously?

34
00:02:54,697 --> 00:02:56,280
Why would he need two?

35
00:02:56,313 --> 00:02:57,080
Beats me.

36
00:02:57,113 --> 00:02:59,040
I'll never understand that guy.

37
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,461
So the price for receiving the eyes of a Shinigami

38
00:03:03,486 --> 00:03:06,054
is no more than half of my remaining lifespan?

39
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:08,226
That's it, right?

40
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,239
Yes.

41
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:12,372
Well then, do we have a deal or not?

42
00:03:13,713 --> 00:03:17,972
Ryuk, this deal is...

43
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:19,945
out of the question.

44
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,661
Huh?

45
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,840
Let's get this straight.

46
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:37,981
My plan is to create an ideal new
world free from evil and all criminals,

47
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:41,794
and I intend to reign as a god
in that world for a very long time.

48
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,567
I might consider the deal if it lengthened my life,

49
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:46,296
but not if I'd die sooner.

50
00:03:47,146 --> 00:03:50,313
I figured you of all people should
know I wouldn't take this deal.

51
00:03:50,352 --> 00:03:51,118
Yeah.

52
00:03:51,305 --> 00:03:54,849
I still felt I should tell you
that the deal existed, just in case.

53
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,808
Anyway, I've done my part.

54
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,736
I don't need you complaining I
didn't tell you this earlier on.

55
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,742
This is what you call telling me early on?

56
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:04,980
Don't you think you're a little late?

57
00:04:05,092 --> 00:04:07,548
I don't see why you couldn't
have told me this when we met.

58
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:12,276
Or better yet, you could have simply included
it in the instructions for the Death Note.

59
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:13,824
Uh, good point.

60
00:04:14,662 --> 00:04:18,246
He's not the slightest bit daunted
by the fact that I'm a Shinigami.

61
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,767
He doesn't suck up to me

62
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:22,900
and he seems to have no problem giving me a hard time.

63
00:04:27,953 --> 00:04:28,656
Well?

64
00:04:28,808 --> 00:04:32,139
You sure there's nothing else
you want to tell me ahead of time,

65
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,558
Shinigami?

66
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:36,747
No. Nothing else.

67
00:04:37,396 --> 00:04:38,288
Probably.

68
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,213
Really?

69
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:40,608
That's too bad.

70
00:04:40,798 --> 00:04:41,773
What do you mean?

71
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:46,619
You know, Ryuk, I might have seriously considered
the deal if you'd offered me wings instead of eyes.

72
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:50,536
Just the idea of flying round
freely in the sky sounds very godlike.

73
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:54,761
After all, it's been mankind's dream
since antiquity to be able to fly.

74
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:58,413
You'd stand out if you sprouted wings and flew around.

75
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:01,417
Not to mention, the police
would have no trouble finding you.

76
00:05:01,753 --> 00:05:03,252
I was only joking.

77
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,421
Anyway, if I keep bargaining for eyes and
wings and whatever else, next thing you know,

78
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:10,637
I'm going to end up becoming a real Shinigami.

79
00:05:11,948 --> 00:05:14,678
Though who knows? I bet that could be pretty interesting.

80
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,413
I wouldn't worry.

81
00:05:16,587 --> 00:05:18,687
Even without the eyes and the wings,

82
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:21,614
you're already a worthy Shinigami.

83
00:05:23,872 --> 00:05:26,572
The Shinigami Realm is slowly rotting.

84
00:05:26,904 --> 00:05:29,546
We lead meaningless and empty lives.

85
00:05:29,778 --> 00:05:32,240
And the only reason we still take human lives

86
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:34,908
is because we're afraid to die ourselves.

87
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:38,952
The truth of the matter is that
we no longer even know why we exist.

88
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,267
In fact, I doubt there's any
reason for our existence at all.

89
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:46,970
What I'm saying is compared to that,

90
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:49,745
you're becoming a much more impressive Shinigami.

91
00:05:50,488 --> 00:05:52,673
I don't know about that. I
mean, from what you're telling me,

92
00:05:52,698 --> 00:05:54,820
it sounds like I'm doing a lot more work than they are.

93
00:05:54,864 --> 00:05:55,437
But...

94
00:05:56,004 --> 00:05:58,463
I don't want to be compared to a Shinigami.

95
00:05:58,997 --> 00:06:03,485
I'm a human using this Death Note to make
the world a better place for other humans.

96
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:10,480
But I wouldn't necessarily say that the
Shinigami Realm is meaningless to humans, either.

97
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:11,210
Huh?

98
00:06:11,826 --> 00:06:13,093
Why do you say that?

99
00:06:13,146 --> 00:06:14,585
Well, just think about it.

100
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,408
Whenever a Shinigami like you comes to the human
world, once every 100, no, more like every 1,000 years,

101
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:22,145
the human world changes dramatically.

102
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,488
The existence of the Shinigami
Realm is extremely significant.

103
00:06:26,603 --> 00:06:27,586
Really?

104
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:31,788
You told me just now that the
Shinigami Realm is slowly rotting, right?

105
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,846
Well, when you return from this world,

106
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:36,582
why not use what you've learned here
to try and change it for the better?

107
00:06:38,046 --> 00:06:41,634
Well, Light, I'm not sure why
I never noticed this until now,

108
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:43,574
but you're quite the positive thinker.

109
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:46,918
Yeah, of course I am.

110
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:49,696
That's why I'm using the Death
Note to create a better world.

111
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:53,109
You have to be a positive thinker
to even attempt something like this.

112
00:06:56,362 --> 00:06:57,230
That's it.

113
00:06:58,663 --> 00:06:59,569
I got it.

114
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:01,098
Got what?

115
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:02,473
What's this about?

116
00:07:05,146 --> 00:07:08,833
I think I just figured out how find the
name the guy who was following me today.

117
00:07:08,986 --> 00:07:10,273
How are you going to do that?

118
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,198
I'm going to use the rules of
the Death Note to my advantage.

119
00:07:13,223 --> 00:07:16,746
I already know that if I write down a cause
of death, I've got 6 minutes and 40 seconds

120
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:19,399
to record the conditions and exact time of death.

121
00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:21,969
First, I need to know exactly

122
00:07:21,994 --> 00:07:25,179
how far I can go in terms of
specifying the details of death.

123
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:27,223
This should be interesting.

124
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:34,264
Yeah, it's me.

125
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:38,509
Another six inmates were found dead last night?

126
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:40,670
All were heart attacks?

127
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:41,960
It's him.

128
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:43,605
What?

129
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:46,237
Bizarre behavior before they died?

130
00:07:46,262 --> 00:07:47,639
Could you be more specific?

131
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:48,973
What do you mean?

132
00:07:48,998 --> 00:07:51,114
So they didn't just die from heart attacks.

133
00:07:51,294 --> 00:07:55,443
No, what I'm saying is they all died of
heart attacks, but it wasn't quite that simple.

134
00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:00,135
Before one of them died, he drew a pentagram
on the wall of this cell using his own blood.

135
00:08:00,344 --> 00:08:03,726
Another left a letter, but it doesn't
seem to be a will or anything meaningful.

136
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,081
And as for the third victim, he escaped from his cell
and ran all the way to the staff bathrooms before he died.

137
00:08:14,777 --> 00:08:16,021
What is it, Watari?

138
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:17,746
Three more heart attack victims.

139
00:08:17,771 --> 00:08:21,467
But the circumstances of their deaths
are different from what we've seen thus far.

140
00:08:21,492 --> 00:08:23,033
What do mean by different?

141
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:27,231
I'm sending you a copy of a letter,
as well as pictures taken at the scene.

142
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:27,994
OK.

143
00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:32,383
It sounds like he was afraid

144
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:33,970
that Kira would find him.

145
00:08:34,627 --> 00:08:38,683
It's believable that our victim might
have been genuinely afraid and wrote this,

146
00:08:38,707 --> 00:08:41,660
but we know Kira can control the time of death.

147
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:44,943
What if he can also determine the
actions in the moments leading up to death?

148
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:46,335
In which case...

149
00:08:47,324 --> 00:08:48,090
Chief.

150
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:49,441
Hm?

151
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,777
We can't release details of
these men's deaths to the media.

152
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:56,734
As far as they're concerned, these are just heart attacks.

153
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:57,679
Oh.

154
00:08:57,989 --> 00:09:02,481
I have reason to believe that Kira was
performing some kind of test using these criminals.

155
00:09:02,654 --> 00:09:03,719
And if that's the case,

156
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:07,073
we'd only be giving him the results of
this information if we took it public.

157
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:09,537
Right. I understand.

158
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:13,208
So now he's experimenting on his victims?

159
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,150
Horrible.

160
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:17,927
He's playing with people's lives,
as if all this was just a game.

161
00:09:18,065 --> 00:09:19,674
It's unforgivable.

162
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:26,005
If Kira is really using criminals as test subjects,

163
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:28,362
what is he trying to achieve?

164
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,634
Look at this, Ryuk.

165
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,298
I think we're in luck.

166
00:09:38,383 --> 00:09:42,369
The results of yesterday's little test have
already been downloaded onto my dad's computer.

167
00:09:42,394 --> 00:09:44,761
And these results are just as I expected.

168
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:47,086
The Death Note will work for what I have in mind.

169
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:48,488
What do you mean by that?

170
00:09:48,729 --> 00:09:52,571
One of them escaped and ran into the
bathroom I had specified in the Death Note.

171
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:54,730
Another one drew the same symbol

172
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:56,910
I had drawn in the Death Note before he died.

173
00:09:57,038 --> 00:10:01,438
And finally, a third wrote the same letter I
had written in the Death Note word for word.

174
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:05,968
All three did exactly what I intended them to do.

175
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:07,776
For the other three inmates,

176
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:10,711
I purposely wrote conditions
that were virtually impossible.

177
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:11,841
Huh?

178
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:16,154
With the first one, I wrote that he would
die in front of the Eiffel Tower in one hour.

179
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:19,481
However, everyone knows that it's physically impossible

180
00:10:19,506 --> 00:10:22,398
to go from a prison in Japan to
Paris, France in only one hour.

181
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:26,310
Since this couldn't happen, he
simply died of a heart attack in prison.

182
00:10:26,516 --> 00:10:30,435
The next was supposed to draw an exact
picture of L's face on the prison wall.

183
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:32,069
This also didn't happen.

184
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,007
You can't draw someone you've never seen, right?

185
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,254
Makes sense.

186
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:39,242
With the last one, I tried something slightly different.

187
00:10:39,274 --> 00:10:41,264
I specified that he would write a note that read,

188
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:44,585
"I know that L is suspicious of the Japanese police."

189
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:49,045
To be honest, I actually expected this
one to work, but it didn't end up happening

190
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:53,644
which means it's impossible to make
someone write what they don't already know.

191
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:57,763
Or at the very least, it has to be the kind of
thing that they could come up with on their own.

192
00:10:57,893 --> 00:11:00,782
Basically, even the Death Note can't do the impossible.

193
00:11:01,222 --> 00:11:05,804
But as long as it's within the realistic
limits of what that person might do,

194
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:09,225
I can control them as much as I want before they die.

195
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,284
That's very clever.

196
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:13,721
But what's all this leading to?

197
00:11:13,787 --> 00:11:14,809
What's the point?

198
00:11:15,223 --> 00:11:19,364
These latest victims will no
doubt keep L and the police guessing.

199
00:11:19,675 --> 00:11:24,227
Even as we speak he's probably trying
to decipher all the clues I left for him,

200
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:25,939
especially that little note.

201
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:29,643
That absolutely meaningless dying message.

202
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:36,259
If Kira used those criminals to
conduct an experiment of some sort,

203
00:11:36,284 --> 00:11:38,631
it means he's about to start something.

204
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:44,698
If he moves now, there's a good chance that
the FBI will notice someone acting suspiciously.

205
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,509
But perhaps he has a different goal in mind altogether.

206
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:53,675
Could the pentagram and this
letter be some kind of message?

207
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,943
Is this it?

208
00:11:57,763 --> 00:12:00,207
All right, time for the real thing.

209
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:01,521
Real thing?

210
00:12:01,607 --> 00:12:05,999
Yesterday on the news, they said this drug
addict tried to rob a bank but was unsuccessful.

211
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,817
He attacked a few people and then ran away emptyhanded.

212
00:12:08,931 --> 00:12:10,000
I'll use him.

213
00:12:10,422 --> 00:12:13,248
It's kind of last minute, but I'm sure I can find someone.

214
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:15,329
I got a few people in mind.

215
00:12:15,354 --> 00:12:16,579
A few people?

216
00:12:16,745 --> 00:12:17,531
For what?

217
00:12:17,556 --> 00:12:18,464
You'll see.

218
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,445
Believe it or not, I'm actually
a rather popular guy, Ryuk.

219
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:32,837
Hello?

220
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:34,710
Huh? Light?

221
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:36,399
Oh, morning.

222
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,247
He's still following me.

223
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:01,703
Perfect.

224
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,758
This whole thing would just be a
waste of time if he wasn't tailing me.

225
00:13:11,512 --> 00:13:12,466
Light!

226
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:14,921
A date?

227
00:13:14,946 --> 00:13:15,622
Yeah.

228
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:18,522
It's a date no matter how you look at it.

229
00:13:18,568 --> 00:13:21,300
And I'm sure even my stalker will see it that way.

230
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:23,579
But this isn't just a date, is it?

231
00:13:23,816 --> 00:13:27,181
You said that you'd figured out
a way to find your stalker's name.

232
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:29,767
So tell me, what do you plan on doing?

233
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:31,662
Huh? Come on.

234
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,419
Didn't you see what I wrote in the Death Note?

235
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:35,203
I explained it in great detail.

236
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:35,963
No.

237
00:13:36,207 --> 00:13:38,565
Doing that would take all the fun out of it.

238
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:42,369
In that case, just be patient and watch what happens.

239
00:13:43,712 --> 00:13:45,450
Sorry, did I keep you waiting?

240
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:46,769
No, not at all.

241
00:13:46,794 --> 00:13:49,770
Anyway, I haven't been to Spaceland since junior high.

242
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:52,404
I'm so excited.

243
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:54,744
And the best part is I have you all to myself.

244
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,292
Uh, yeah.

245
00:13:57,882 --> 00:13:58,859
During the week

246
00:13:58,892 --> 00:14:01,224
he goes to school and crams school at night.

247
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:03,235
Dates on his day off.

248
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:06,332
A normal kid, just a hardworking senior in high school.

249
00:14:06,782 --> 00:14:09,562
Chief Yagami's son, Light Yagami.

250
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:11,486
No cause for suspicion.

251
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,088
At any rate, I'll be done with my
surveillance today, and that'll be it.

252
00:14:26,017 --> 00:14:27,491
I don't get it, Light.

253
00:14:27,582 --> 00:14:30,792
Didn't you say you weren't going
out until entrance exams were over?

254
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:34,105
That was before I scored number
one on the national practice exams.

255
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,964
Ooh, you're such a nerd.

256
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:11,838
It's him. He's here.

257
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,304
Seven passengers excluding him.

258
00:15:16,337 --> 00:15:17,337
No one's in the way.

259
00:15:17,362 --> 00:15:18,972
Everything should go smoothly.

260
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:22,327
Aahh!

261
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,496
Stay in your seats unless you want to die!

262
00:15:26,763 --> 00:15:27,963
A busjacking?

263
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,659
You gotta be kidding me.

264
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:30,814
Everybody shut up!

265
00:15:31,338 --> 00:15:33,881
If anybody moves, I'm putting a bullet in their head.

266
00:15:34,415 --> 00:15:36,582
All right, driver, you listen to me.

267
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:39,286
I know you've got the number
for Spaceland's office on you.

268
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:40,090
Call 'em!

269
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:41,012
OK.

270
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:44,822
This this is Sasaki calling from bus 174.

271
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:47,099
Tell 'em what's going on and no tricks, either.

272
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:51,703
My bus has been hijacked and
he's holding a gun to my head.

273
00:15:51,728 --> 00:15:52,490
Give me that.

274
00:15:52,704 --> 00:15:54,021
You heard what he said.

275
00:15:54,326 --> 00:15:55,486
Now you listen up.

276
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:59,287
Have a female staff member bring
all of Spaceland's cash from yesterday.

277
00:15:59,312 --> 00:16:00,446
I know it's there.

278
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:02,398
Have her meet us two bus stops from the park,

279
00:16:02,423 --> 00:16:03,790
and don't make me wait.

280
00:16:03,815 --> 00:16:06,928
If you mess with me at all or
try to get the police involved,

281
00:16:06,953 --> 00:16:09,704
I swear I'll kill every one of these passengers.

282
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:10,750
Hunnh!

283
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:20,293
Yuri, don't be scared.

284
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,629
As soon as he turns around

285
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,575
I'm going to grab the gun out of his hand.

286
00:16:24,356 --> 00:16:25,955
Don't be stupid. That's risky.

287
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:28,056
If it comes to that, I'll take care of it.

288
00:16:29,745 --> 00:16:30,619
It's OK.

289
00:16:30,644 --> 00:16:32,577
We don't have to pass notes back and forth.

290
00:16:32,602 --> 00:16:36,491
As long as we keep it down, he won't be able
to hear our voices over the sound of the engine.

291
00:16:38,302 --> 00:16:40,966
Do you have any proof that you're not his accomplice?

292
00:16:40,991 --> 00:16:42,623
Why should we trust you?

293
00:16:43,308 --> 00:16:44,340
Accomplice?

294
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:46,221
Yes, I've read about this before.

295
00:16:46,246 --> 00:16:49,085
The first hijacker comes in like he's working alone.

296
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,604
Meanwhile, a second one pretends to
be a hostage and stays in the very back,

297
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:54,491
just in case something goes wrong.

298
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:55,526
What's the matter?

299
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:58,077
You you really think he is one?

300
00:16:58,923 --> 00:17:00,862
I... I have no choice.

301
00:17:00,991 --> 00:17:03,012
I'm sure Light Yagami isn't Kira.

302
00:17:03,146 --> 00:17:05,349
If he was, he could just kill
this guy with a heart attack.

303
00:17:07,072 --> 00:17:08,802
Here's my proof. Take a look.

304
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:11,556
FBI?

305
00:17:11,752 --> 00:17:12,700
I see.

306
00:17:12,836 --> 00:17:18,344
L needed an outsider so he got the FBI to
investigate anyone connected to the Japanese police.

307
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:21,236
His name is Raye Penber.

308
00:17:23,985 --> 00:17:24,973
I trust you.

309
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:31,040
And I guess for the time being, I won't bother asking
what an FBI agent is doing on the bus in the first place.

310
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:31,991
Do you have a gun?

311
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:33,099
Yeah, I've got one.

312
00:17:33,124 --> 00:17:35,608
So if it comes down to it, I can rely on you, right?

313
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,212
Yes.

314
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:39,259
Get the hell up, you old hag!

315
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:41,048
You want me to shoot you right now?

316
00:17:41,621 --> 00:17:43,382
That's right, this guy.

317
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:45,917
His face was all over the local news just a few days ago.

318
00:17:45,962 --> 00:17:46,585
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

319
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,297
Some junkie.

320
00:17:47,322 --> 00:17:50,878
He tried to rob a bank and ended up
killing three people before he got away.

321
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:53,149
He's extremely dangerous.

322
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:55,279
We're safe. He won't shoot us.

323
00:17:55,304 --> 00:17:57,541
In fact, he's not gonna do anything.

324
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:00,440
Aaah!

325
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:02,174
Don't move, you little punk!

326
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:05,579
What the hell is that?

327
00:18:06,122 --> 00:18:07,879
Ah, smartass.

328
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:10,096
You guys were planning something back here, weren't you?

329
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:10,581
Damn it.

330
00:18:10,683 --> 00:18:12,114
If he sees that note from before,

331
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:14,677
he'll find out that Light was planning
to jump him and take his gun away.

332
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:20,010
Plans for a date, huh?

333
00:18:20,404 --> 00:18:21,944
Stupid kid.

334
00:18:23,444 --> 00:18:24,261
Gotcha.

335
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,368
Huh?

336
00:18:32,783 --> 00:18:34,347
Who... who the hell are you?

337
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:36,996
You in the very back, what do you think you're doing?

338
00:18:37,468 --> 00:18:39,799
D-don't mess with me!

339
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:42,658
How long you been hiding back there?

340
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,029
What's this?

341
00:18:44,441 --> 00:18:45,916
You're talking to me?

342
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:48,711
So you mean you can actually see me right now?

343
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:50,405
Ahhh! Stay there, you!

344
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:52,783
You keep away from me, you freak.

345
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:54,621
This isn't good. He's hallucinating.

346
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:57,079
Everyone get down!

347
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:00,862
Oh, I get it.

348
00:19:01,363 --> 00:19:04,335
That little note that, like, accidentally dropped

349
00:19:04,422 --> 00:19:07,622
was actually torn from the pages of the Death Note itself.

350
00:19:07,686 --> 00:19:10,232
Since he tricked this guy into touching the paper,

351
00:19:10,257 --> 00:19:12,714
he's the only other one in the bus who can see me.

352
00:19:12,964 --> 00:19:14,697
That's so smart.

353
00:19:14,886 --> 00:19:15,957
Get away!

354
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:16,833
Aaaghh!

355
00:19:16,978 --> 00:19:18,055
Aaaaaagh!

356
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:20,189
Sorry, pal.

357
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:23,671
I'm a Shinigami, so I'm afraid
your bullets aren't gonna kill me.

358
00:19:35,964 --> 00:19:38,491
Anyone who touches the Death Note can see me.

359
00:19:38,516 --> 00:19:42,989
I have to stay till the death Note is
finished or I see you die, whichever comes first.

360
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:45,651
And the Shinigami can't die from being shot.

361
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:48,529
I've said all these things at one time or another.

362
00:19:48,623 --> 00:19:51,314
Well, he is the top-ranked student in the country.

363
00:19:51,556 --> 00:19:53,689
Guess I shouldn't be surprised.

364
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:55,723
He even used this hijacking as a way

365
00:19:55,748 --> 00:19:59,232
to get the guy following him
to willingly give up his name.

366
00:20:01,008 --> 00:20:01,974
Stop the bus.

367
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:03,465
Let me off!

368
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,269
11:45 on the dot.

369
00:20:32,536 --> 00:20:34,732
Everything went just as I planned.

370
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,303
Kiichiro Osoreda.

371
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:39,806
Accidental death.

372
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:44,663
Boards the 11:31 Spaceland-bound bus
near the eastern entrance to the park

373
00:20:44,752 --> 00:20:47,952
holding a loaded gun and attempts to hijack the bus.

374
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:52,298
Sees a horrific phantom and
empties his gun trying to kill it.

375
00:20:52,622 --> 00:20:55,066
Terrified, he flees the bus.

376
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:58,413
Immediately afterwards, at 11:45,

377
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,050
he dies when struck by a car.

378
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:10,484
The Death Note never failes.

379
00:21:14,552 --> 00:21:18,855
You will be next, Raye Penber.

380
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:38,894
It's just as I thought.

381
00:22:39,627 --> 00:22:41,732
He doesn't suspect me at all.

382
00:22:41,824 --> 00:22:45,382
The remaining investigators will all die of heart attacks.

383
00:22:45,819 --> 00:22:48,749
Farewell, Raye Penber.
