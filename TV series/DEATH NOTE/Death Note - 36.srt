1
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,688
L. I want to meet you.

2
00:01:29,778 --> 00:01:33,184
Daikoku Wharf, an abandoned
warehouse known as the Yellow Box.

3
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:36,627
How about three days from now, on the 28th at 1:00 PM?

4
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:38,052
That's fine by me.

5
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:41,511
Take off everything you're
wearing and put it all in that box.

6
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:43,723
You can use this blanket.

7
00:01:43,748 --> 00:01:45,506
Ms. Takada, are you all right?

8
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:46,662
Light.

9
00:01:46,944 --> 00:01:48,944
I did exactly what you told me to.

10
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:52,775
I made survival my first priority and... and I did it.

11
00:01:53,383 --> 00:01:54,630
Come quickly.

12
00:01:54,784 --> 00:01:55,851
Save me.

13
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:57,239
Kiyomi Takada.

14
00:01:57,264 --> 00:01:58,362
Suicide.

15
00:01:58,706 --> 00:02:03,204
January 26th, 2013. 2:32 PM.

16
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:06,647
Burns to death by setting fire to everything around her,

17
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:09,115
including everything she wrote on.

18
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:14,701
It is with great sorrow that I must announce
the passing of one of our very own colleagues.

19
00:02:14,973 --> 00:02:21,510
The police have identified one of the bodies
found at the scene as NHN's Ms. Kiyomi Takada.

20
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:26,907
A two ton truck and a motorcycle were also
found in the ruins of the burned out church.

21
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,391
Investigators suspect gasoline was used to start the fire.

22
00:02:36,951 --> 00:02:40,642
What I really want to know is who's
going to be Kira's next spokesperson.

23
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,793
Kira's message still needs to be
spread, and someone's gotta do it.

24
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,441
The death of newscaster Takada was a horrible tragedy,

25
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:50,405
but I can't help but think that if she was that careless,

26
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,922
she couldn't have taken her position
as Kira's spokesperson that seriously.

27
00:02:53,947 --> 00:02:55,008
It needs to be said.

28
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:56,666
This is not a woman's job.

29
00:02:56,691 --> 00:02:57,470
Kira.

30
00:02:57,562 --> 00:02:59,625
Please make me your new representative.

31
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,650
No!

32
00:03:00,674 --> 00:03:02,698
Give the honor to Sakura TV again!

33
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:04,004
Disgusting.

34
00:03:04,056 --> 00:03:05,377
Yeah, I know.

35
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:08,569
I mean, they just announced her
death, and already it's started.

36
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,066
Every TV station airing its own
segment on who should replace her.

37
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:13,775
It's like she never existed.

38
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,214
Last night's judgments unfolded just as planned.

39
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,391
That means Takada and Mikumi have
had no problems contacting each other.

40
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:24,678
There's nothing to worry about.

41
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:28,001
It's near.

42
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:30,858
Hello L.

43
00:03:31,064 --> 00:03:31,686
Yes?

44
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:35,901
I don't mean to keep bothering
you, but with regards to our meeting,

45
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:44,790
I wanted to confirm that we are still
set for the 28th at 1:00 PM, all right?

46
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:45,796
Yes.

47
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:48,517
It's just as I predicted.

48
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,526
He's sticking with the original time.

49
00:03:50,584 --> 00:03:52,112
There's no doubt about it.

50
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:54,044
Very well.

51
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:56,415
The 28th. The day after tomorrow.

52
00:03:57,873 --> 00:03:58,457
Right.

53
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:06,125
So, the day of tomorrow, huh?

54
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,230
Finally. Isn't it getting exciting?

55
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:09,214
Y... Yeah.

56
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:11,846
I can't help but wonder what Near wants to show us.

57
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:14,934
Matsuda, Ide.

58
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,320
When the day comes, there's a
good chance we might all be killed.

59
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:21,090
Don't you understand that?

60
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:23,428
Giovanni.

61
00:04:23,494 --> 00:04:24,193
Yes?

62
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,955
Will you be able to make it in time?

63
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:27,868
Yes. I'll be there for sure.

64
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,915
Commander Rester, Lidner, Giovanni.

65
00:04:35,518 --> 00:04:37,772
Let's put our best into this, shall we?

66
00:05:05,462 --> 00:05:07,163
Good morning, everyone.

67
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,958
Uh, good morning.

68
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,466
First of all, in regards to Misa Amane,

69
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:16,328
we've already set her free.

70
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:18,359
You may call her to confirm it.

71
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:25,390
I don't know what's going on, but this
must be some sort of compensation or something!

72
00:05:25,415 --> 00:05:28,372
They totally put me up in the
penthouse suite of the Teido Hotel.

73
00:05:28,397 --> 00:05:29,604
Can you believe it?

74
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:31,616
Now, this is more like it!

75
00:05:31,772 --> 00:05:34,142
I understand. All right, Misa.

76
00:05:34,628 --> 00:05:37,426
Please stay there for a little
while longer until I call you.

77
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:38,943
OK!

78
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:43,391
All right, Near. I need you to connect me with Mogi.

79
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:47,010
We have the notebook locked away here,
and in order to open the safe it's kept in,

80
00:05:47,035 --> 00:05:49,483
we'll need the pin number from each member of the team.

81
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:50,867
Understood.

82
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:52,644
I'll connect you to him immediately.

83
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:55,994
This is Mogi.

84
00:05:56,061 --> 00:06:00,011
Number is 62-324.

85
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,272
All that's left is my number.

86
00:06:14,462 --> 00:06:16,335
The killer notebook.

87
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:19,394
How to use it.

88
00:06:19,484 --> 00:06:23,384
The human whose name is written
in this notebook shall die.

89
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:26,052
This note will not take effect unless the writer has

90
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:29,186
the person's face in their
mind when writing his or her name.

91
00:06:29,564 --> 00:06:32,834
Therefore, people sharing the
same name will not be affected.

92
00:06:33,022 --> 00:06:35,573
If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds

93
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:38,108
of writing the person's name, it will happen.

94
00:06:38,206 --> 00:06:42,206
If the cause of death is not specified,
the person will simply die of a heart attack.

95
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:48,117
After writing the cause of death, details of the death
should be written in the next six minutes and 40 seconds.

96
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:54,768
Near, it's me.

97
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:58,338
We've discussed it, and it's been decided
that I'll be the one to carry the notebook.

98
00:06:58,372 --> 00:07:01,494
L, are you sure it's all right
with you if Mr. Aizawa carries it?

99
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,461
Be honest.

100
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,848
Of course.

101
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,431
I chose Aizawa for the job
because we knew you'd prefer that.

102
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,022
I have no problems with it.

103
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,705
I appreciate it. Thank you.

104
00:07:12,072 --> 00:07:13,945
Well then, we'll see you shortly.

105
00:07:30,306 --> 00:07:32,545
Looks like this is the end.

106
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:33,562
No.

107
00:07:33,784 --> 00:07:35,659
More like the beginning.

108
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,356
The perfect world of Kira.

109
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,714
And those who know of the notebook's existence,

110
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:46,627
all of them...

111
00:07:47,305 --> 00:07:48,820
will die.

112
00:07:57,273 --> 00:07:59,187
There's no mistake, Near's inside.

113
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,217
I checked it out.

114
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,118
All right. Let's do this.

115
00:09:56,043 --> 00:09:57,010
Near.

116
00:09:57,035 --> 00:09:59,785
You're far inferior to L.

117
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,544
You have no right to be wearing a mask of L.

118
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:04,855
It's them.

119
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:06,872
Those four are the SPK.

120
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,176
And the one wearing a mask is Near.

121
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:10,862
Hang on.

122
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:12,751
Am I the only one who sees something wrong?

123
00:10:12,776 --> 00:10:15,145
He can go around accusing people of being Kira,

124
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:18,486
but the fact that he's wearing a mask
says he's only trying to protect himself.

125
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:19,690
Not anyone else.

126
00:10:21,276 --> 00:10:22,699
It's just a precaution.

127
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:25,313
There's a good possibility that Kira has already seen

128
00:10:25,355 --> 00:10:28,208
the faces of everyone in this warehouse, except for mine.

129
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:32,247
In fact, he may be writing down your names as we speak.

130
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:36,322
So I'd like to wait for one hour. No, make it 30 minutes.

131
00:10:36,347 --> 00:10:40,506
That should give us more than enough time to
see if anyone is being controlled before they die.

132
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:42,144
Huh? What?

133
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,183
You're gonna wait and see if we die?

134
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:48,222
No. It's not impossible that Light really is Kira,

135
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:51,416
especially since the rest of
us are of no use to him anymore.

136
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:32,475
This is all just a front to buy some time, isn't it?

137
00:11:33,098 --> 00:11:37,337
I never thought it would be this hard
to keep myself from laughing out loud.

138
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,083
Near must be waiting for him to come.

139
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:42,419
It's all just as I predicted.

140
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:48,363
Near!

141
00:11:48,388 --> 00:11:50,029
It's already been over 30 minutes.

142
00:11:50,054 --> 00:11:51,218
Nothing's happened yet.

143
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:52,754
Of course not.

144
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,940
That's because Kira's not here with us.

145
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:57,675
Very well.

146
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:59,530
Everyone seems to be safe.

147
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,749
I'll remove my mask now.

148
00:12:23,211 --> 00:12:24,432
You're quiet, Near.

149
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:25,543
What's wrong?

150
00:12:26,543 --> 00:12:28,675
Are you still waiting for something?

151
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:30,717
Waiting.

152
00:12:31,032 --> 00:12:33,365
That's an excellent choice of words.

153
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:38,016
Yes, I am waiting, for the arrival of the
one who will solve everything once and for all.

154
00:12:38,698 --> 00:12:40,943
Someone else is supposed to clear this up?

155
00:12:41,176 --> 00:12:42,763
He'll be here soon.

156
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,667
It's only a matter of time.

157
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:47,010
There's only one entrance to this building,

158
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:50,566
and the only way to look inside is by opening that door.

159
00:12:50,783 --> 00:12:55,944
That means he'll either walk through that door,
or at the very least, open it and peek through.

160
00:12:56,154 --> 00:12:58,346
And just who is this person, anyway?

161
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:03,213
X Kira, the one who is currently using the
notebook and killing people on Kira's behalf.

162
00:13:03,238 --> 00:13:05,788
He's bound to come here and bring the notebook with them.

163
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,278
And then he'll see me, and write down my real name.

164
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:14,761
Or rather, he'll write down the names of everyone
here knows about the notebook, and kill them.

165
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:16,189
Huh?

166
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:17,696
What?

167
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,705
What are you saying?

168
00:13:19,785 --> 00:13:21,209
This doesn't make any sense.

169
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:22,628
What are you trying to tell us, Near?

170
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:26,618
That some other guy's going to drop by with
the notebook, poke his head in, and kill us all?

171
00:13:26,665 --> 00:13:29,049
And you want us to sit back and let it happen?

172
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:31,028
Yes. That's correct.

173
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:32,428
Now, listen carefully.

174
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:34,852
If someone comes into the warehouse through that door,

175
00:13:34,877 --> 00:13:36,834
just let him in without resisting.

176
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:38,645
If a door opens slightly,

177
00:13:38,704 --> 00:13:41,245
simply act as if you don't notice anyone there.

178
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:43,769
But but that's just crazy!

179
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:46,966
He's already here.

180
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,035
God!

181
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,308
Delete!

182
00:14:17,365 --> 00:14:18,247
Delete.

183
00:14:18,298 --> 00:14:18,958
Delete.

184
00:14:19,132 --> 00:14:19,987
Delete.

185
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:20,849
Delete.

186
00:14:20,898 --> 00:14:24,765
Delete. Delete. Delete. Delete. Delete.

187
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,242
Delete. Delete. Delete!

188
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:31,951
Delete. Delete. Delete. Delete!

189
00:14:32,142 --> 00:14:33,413
Hold it! Don't do anything.

190
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:34,491
Everything is fine.

191
00:14:34,516 --> 00:14:35,525
You won't die.

192
00:14:35,854 --> 00:14:38,285
How can you be so sure, Near?

193
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:40,365
Because I modified the notebook.

194
00:14:40,487 --> 00:14:41,247
Huh?

195
00:14:41,272 --> 00:14:42,962
We took brief possession of the notebook

196
00:14:42,987 --> 00:14:44,417
and replaced the pages.

197
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:47,363
The person behind the door has
been doing the killings for Kira.

198
00:14:47,443 --> 00:14:50,445
He has also been using exactly one page every day.

199
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:53,099
Based on that, I was able to replace the page

200
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:56,009
he would use today, as well as all subsequent pages,

201
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:57,451
so that no one else would die.

202
00:14:57,476 --> 00:15:00,272
Delete. Delete. Delete. Delete.

203
00:15:00,297 --> 00:15:00,863
Delete.

204
00:15:00,888 --> 00:15:01,685
Delete.

205
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,590
Delete.

206
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:10,023
Delete!

207
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:29,906
On the other side of that door is X Kira.

208
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,343
My guess is in roughly 40 seconds,

209
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,513
he'll look inside to see if we're dead.

210
00:15:34,777 --> 00:15:37,229
That's when we'll restrain him and seize the notebook.

211
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:41,162
Whoever's name is not written down must be Kira.

212
00:15:42,954 --> 00:15:44,376
It... It's true.

213
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:47,624
Kira would be the only one that guy wouldn't try to kill.

214
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:49,661
But still.

215
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:06,040
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it!

216
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:15,473
I knew all along you had tampered with the notebook.

217
00:16:15,498 --> 00:16:18,282
Near, you've been completely defeated.

218
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:24,814
The notebook you altered was nothing
more than a forgery I had Mikami prepare.

219
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,402
On the other hand, the one Mikami is
writing their names in is the real notebook,

220
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:31,839
which had been kept hidden until now.

221
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:42,817
I had Mikami create a fake notebook for himself.

222
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:45,990
He also sent Takada several pages from the real one,

223
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:50,204
so in fact, it was Takada, not
Mikami, who was doing the killings.

224
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:55,858
As for Mikami, I had him write names in
public several times using the fake notebook.

225
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:59,284
That way he'd be noticed by anyone who was following him.

226
00:16:59,422 --> 00:17:01,687
But Takada was the one behind the deaths.

227
00:17:01,712 --> 00:17:04,931
Mikami simply sent the names and faces by cellphone.

228
00:17:05,153 --> 00:17:10,452
This little performance was how I made the SPK
believe that the notebook Mikami used was the real one.

229
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,750
Mikami's daily behavior is so
methodical, it's almost obsessive.

230
00:17:14,787 --> 00:17:18,493
He always fills exactly one page with names, every day.

231
00:17:18,518 --> 00:17:23,613
And Near, you noticed this little habit and
though you could use it to tamper with the notebook.

232
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:28,104
All you had to do was count ahead to the
page he'd use on the day of this meeting.

233
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:31,483
Then you replaced all the pages from that day onwards.

234
00:17:31,698 --> 00:17:34,926
You were confident you could prevent anyone from dying.

235
00:17:35,032 --> 00:17:37,115
That was your big plan.

236
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,612
That's why you couldn't change
the date and time of our meeting.

237
00:17:40,637 --> 00:17:43,204
But I was one step ahead of you, Near.

238
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,519
I always knew you were going
to try and alter the Death Note.

239
00:17:46,544 --> 00:17:51,587
That's why I had Mikami check the
notebook every day for signs of tampering.

240
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:55,458
I've confirmed it.

241
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:05,645
I knew I'd won this game as soon as I got that message.

242
00:18:05,776 --> 00:18:11,777
Mikami brought a different notebook today, the
real one, which had been kept hidden up until now.

243
00:18:15,654 --> 00:18:20,574
But you know, Near, you did have a
chance to win, if only you'd taken it.

244
00:18:20,618 --> 00:18:22,379
You were just too naive.

245
00:18:23,053 --> 00:18:25,634
You're nothing compared to L.

246
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:31,822
L would have considered the possibility of a fake notebook
from the very beginning, and he would have tested it.

247
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:34,818
You had the chance, but you squandered it.

248
00:18:34,843 --> 00:18:38,635
I've gotta say, I'm so disappointed in you.

249
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:40,590
This victory was no fun.

250
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:44,025
You tried too hard to win in a noble way.

251
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:45,190
Well, that's fine.

252
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:48,056
Everyone here dies today, thanks to you.

253
00:18:48,081 --> 00:18:53,576
And as for me, I, Kira, will have my perfect victory.

254
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:10,475
You there, outside.

255
00:19:10,588 --> 00:19:11,248
Huh?

256
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:14,574
Have you finished writing down the names in the notebook?

257
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:16,767
God.

258
00:19:18,347 --> 00:19:19,847
Yes. I've written them.

259
00:19:25,821 --> 00:19:27,850
No. I can't laugh yet.

260
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,732
I've got to hold it in.

261
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,714
They're all gonna die.

262
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:34,266
40 seconds after he wrote down their names.

263
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,771
35 seconds.

264
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:38,180
I'll claim my victory then.

265
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,210
Don't you think it's rather odd?

266
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:40,958
Hm?

267
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:47,382
Why would he answer you so quickly, calmly, and honestly
when you asked him if he had written down our names yet?

268
00:19:47,574 --> 00:19:49,446
Who knows? Maybe he's just honest.

269
00:19:49,614 --> 00:19:54,018
Or confident that he'll succeed or
perhaps he's seen through your brilliant plan.

270
00:19:54,043 --> 00:19:56,503
Huh? In that case, we're in big trouble.

271
00:19:58,371 --> 00:19:59,916
Teru Mikami.

272
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,048
If it's not too much trouble for you,
won't you please come in and join us?

273
00:20:05,877 --> 00:20:09,938
I already know that you're the one who's
been judging and executing people for Kira.

274
00:20:10,132 --> 00:20:13,723
If you've already written down our names,
then there shouldn't be anything to be afraid of.

275
00:20:13,954 --> 00:20:15,476
You can come right on in.

276
00:20:18,243 --> 00:20:19,706
Teru Mikami, is it?

277
00:20:19,832 --> 00:20:20,799
He's correct.

278
00:20:20,824 --> 00:20:23,376
There's no reason to hide from us. You can come in.

279
00:20:24,238 --> 00:20:24,959
God.

280
00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:48,738
You've done well, Mikami.

281
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:53,395
How many seconds has it been
since you wrote down the first name?

282
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:04,990
30 seconds.

283
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:17,298
31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39!

284
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,708
Well Near.

285
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,310
Looks like I win.

286
00:21:20,335 --> 00:21:21,783
40!

287
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:46,272
That's right.

288
00:22:46,884 --> 00:22:48,629
I am Kira.
