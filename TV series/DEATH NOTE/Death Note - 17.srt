1
00:01:32,747 --> 00:01:36,522
You will continue to kill
criminals whose names are broadcast.

2
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:40,257
Outside of that, you're free to
use the Death Note however you wish.

3
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,313
That's the only condition.

4
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,760
If everything happens as Light Yagami planned.

5
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,529
This should help save Misa.

6
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,838
Do as I say and you'll get what you want.

7
00:01:50,863 --> 00:01:53,492
In the end it works out well for both of us.

8
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,234
I suppose for someone in your
position you'd call this good business.

9
00:02:03,877 --> 00:02:06,177
Mister Yagami, are you all right?

10
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:09,077
There's no reason for you to keep doing this to yourself.

11
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:13,704
It's been over a month since Kira
started killing criminals again.

12
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:19,279
And as far as I'm concerned, that's all the
proof I need to be sure that my son isn't Kira.

13
00:02:19,686 --> 00:02:22,750
So then all that's left is for you to be sure.

14
00:02:23,618 --> 00:02:26,251
One way or another, when I get out of here,

15
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:27,615
it will be with my son.

16
00:02:29,194 --> 00:02:31,417
Wow, the Chief can be pretty stubborn.

17
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,482
Light, how are you feeling right now?

18
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:37,142
I'm OK.

19
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:40,609
Ryuzaki, I know that in the time I've been in prison,

20
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:42,598
no new criminals have died.

21
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:44,861
However that suggests to me that Kira

22
00:02:44,886 --> 00:02:48,159
must be someone who's intimately
familiar with my situation.

23
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:48,721
And if that's the case...

24
00:02:48,746 --> 00:02:49,392
No, Light.

25
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:52,976
The reason criminals have stopped
dying is because you are Kira.

26
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:54,734
No, I'm not Kira!

27
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,973
How many times do I have to say it?

28
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:01,673
If Light were Kira, he'd know that I was
bluffing, so why is he getting so upset?

29
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:03,467
He honestly seems clueless.

30
00:03:04,386 --> 00:03:05,820
This is just cruel.

31
00:03:05,845 --> 00:03:07,394
I don't care if he is a suspect.

32
00:03:07,427 --> 00:03:10,465
Light still has a right to know
that criminals are being killed again.

33
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:12,540
Amane?

34
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:13,795
Yes?

35
00:03:13,886 --> 00:03:15,407
Are you OK?

36
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,819
You seem tired.

37
00:03:16,844 --> 00:03:18,517
Is that supposed to be funny?

38
00:03:19,053 --> 00:03:23,663
How were you expecting me to look after
being tied up and questioned for this many days.

39
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:25,144
Hm. That's true.

40
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,386
Please just let me go.

41
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:29,498
I want to see Light.

42
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:30,905
Please?

43
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,320
Light?

44
00:03:32,524 --> 00:03:33,586
Let me.

45
00:03:36,397 --> 00:03:38,865
I'm not sure how much more of
this the three of them can take.

46
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,382
Ryuzaki, you have no reason
to keep Light locked up anymore.

47
00:03:42,407 --> 00:03:43,853
Do the right thing and let him go.

48
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:45,582
Then we can get the Chief out too.

49
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:50,127
Criminals are still being killed, even though Misa
and Light haven't access to any of that information.

50
00:03:50,152 --> 00:03:52,771
We know that much already, so what are you waiting for?

51
00:03:53,345 --> 00:03:54,245
Not true.

52
00:03:54,303 --> 00:03:55,603
All we really know at this point is

53
00:03:55,628 --> 00:03:59,425
that Amane harbors an unnaturally
strong devotion for Light Yagami.

54
00:04:00,215 --> 00:04:04,373
Ryuzaki, I'm sorry, but with all
due respect, from where I'm standing,

55
00:04:04,398 --> 00:04:08,574
it's starting to look like you're only doing this because
you don't want to admit that you were wrong about Light.

56
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,336
Yes, I figured you'd say that.

57
00:04:11,028 --> 00:04:12,003
OK, fine.

58
00:04:12,028 --> 00:04:16,005
But we do know that Kira killed Lind.
L. Tailor and those FBI agents, right?

59
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:21,028
As Light said, if Kira could kill while under
surveillance and without access to information,

60
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,553
there would have been no need.

61
00:04:22,587 --> 00:04:24,120
If they didn't pose a threat to him,

62
00:04:24,153 --> 00:04:26,065
then why would he bother killing them?

63
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,513
Kira doesn't kill without good reason,

64
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:29,703
I've heard you say so yourself on more than one occasion.

65
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,082
Oh, I see.

66
00:04:31,107 --> 00:04:33,553
If he was able to kill under these circumstances,

67
00:04:33,578 --> 00:04:37,321
then he wouldn't have been concerned
about those FBI agents in the first place.

68
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:39,832
It's already been 50 days.

69
00:04:39,857 --> 00:04:41,797
There's no point to this anymore.

70
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:46,301
Ryuzaki, it's time to start looking for the real killer.

71
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,550
Yes, I understand.

72
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:07,785
Mr. Yagami?

73
00:05:08,294 --> 00:05:09,694
Yes, what is it?

74
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:12,680
Would you be willing to come to headquarters, just once?

75
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:16,453
I'd like to discuss my thoughts with
you, but it must be done in person.

76
00:05:16,487 --> 00:05:19,866
However, above all else, I need
to talk to you as Light's father.

77
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:23,400
All right. I'll come.

78
00:05:45,787 --> 00:05:49,651
Honestly, all this time I never
pictured you as an old man, Mr. Stalker.

79
00:05:49,676 --> 00:05:52,865
I am not your stalker, I'm a detective with the MPA.

80
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,557
What?

81
00:05:53,643 --> 00:05:54,437
Hey, wait.

82
00:05:54,726 --> 00:05:55,899
I remember now.

83
00:05:55,932 --> 00:05:59,065
You told me I was being arrested for
being arrested for being the second Kira.

84
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,414
You mean that was for real?

85
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:03,051
No. You're a stalker.

86
00:06:03,076 --> 00:06:06,663
There's no way the police would blindfold
me and tie me up all fetish like that.

87
00:06:07,136 --> 00:06:10,255
Anyways, it's kind of weird that
you have my hands and feet all tied up,

88
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,174
even though you're planning to let me go.

89
00:06:12,228 --> 00:06:13,925
Please, just keep quiet.

90
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:26,998
Light!

91
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:27,556
Misa?

92
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:29,148
Oh, I missed you so much, Light.

93
00:06:29,173 --> 00:06:31,195
Dad, tell me. What's all this about?

94
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,452
He's your dad?

95
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:37,143
Oh my God, I totally called your dad a stalker and
said he was old and all kinds of other rude stuff.

96
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:38,268
Pleased to meet you.

97
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:40,152
My name's Misa Amane, I'm Light's girlfriend.

98
00:06:40,177 --> 00:06:41,768
They're all yours, Cheif.

99
00:06:45,053 --> 00:06:47,077
Let's go. Get in the car.

100
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,549
I was starting to think I'd never get out there.

101
00:06:54,574 --> 00:06:56,653
But it feels good to finally be cleared.

102
00:06:56,734 --> 00:06:57,628
No.

103
00:06:58,045 --> 00:07:02,209
I'm afraid you two are being taken to your execution.

104
00:07:03,816 --> 00:07:06,753
I wanted to be the one to
escort you to the execution site.

105
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:10,251
It was secretly built in an
underground facility not far from here.

106
00:07:10,398 --> 00:07:10,802
What?

107
00:07:10,827 --> 00:07:11,448
Execution?

108
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:11,965
Is this a joke?

109
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:12,965
What the hell are you talking about?

110
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,691
We didn't do anything!

111
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:15,784
L is convinced that you are Kira, Light.

112
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:18,494
And that Misa Amane is the second Kira.

113
00:07:18,616 --> 00:07:23,191
Here he is convinced that the only way we can
prevent the murders is to execute the two of you.

114
00:07:23,535 --> 00:07:26,033
I don't understand. The killings have already stopped.

115
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,887
No, they never stopped.

116
00:07:27,931 --> 00:07:29,029
They never...

117
00:07:29,654 --> 00:07:31,887
That's not what he told me. So he was lying?

118
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,481
L was trying to get a confession out of you, Light.

119
00:07:34,506 --> 00:07:35,913
He would have said anything.

120
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:38,111
But at this point, that's not the problem.

121
00:07:38,653 --> 00:07:39,809
It's political now.

122
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:43,698
You see, L's suggestion that the killings
would stop if you two were eliminated

123
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:48,298
was unanimously accepted by top officials
in the UN and the Japanese government.

124
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:50,413
They want Kira to disappear.

125
00:07:50,446 --> 00:07:52,365
No trial, no publicity.

126
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,355
But that's completely insane. Please, dad. I'm not Kira.

127
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,054
That's right.

128
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,791
What kind of a father are you, anyway?

129
00:07:57,816 --> 00:07:59,353
This is your own son you're talking about.

130
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:01,542
L made this decision, not me.

131
00:08:01,642 --> 00:08:03,498
And his word is absolute.

132
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:07,848
Over the years he's tackled the most
difficult cases, solving all of them.

133
00:08:07,956 --> 00:08:09,395
He's never been wrong.

134
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:13,731
You trust L more than you trust me, your own son?

135
00:08:13,931 --> 00:08:16,806
L went so far as to stake his life on this theory.

136
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,215
If the killings don't stop,
then he, too, will be executed.

137
00:08:21,144 --> 00:08:22,540
L said that?

138
00:08:22,631 --> 00:08:24,120
What could he be thinking?

139
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:28,920
I know that given the material evidence
this might seem like the only logical solution.

140
00:08:28,953 --> 00:08:31,046
But he's making a mistake.

141
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:33,356
How could L come to this conclusion?

142
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:35,009
Something's not right here.

143
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:37,895
It's just, it's not like L at all.

144
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,800
The L I know would rely on hard evidence.

145
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:42,428
He has to have the truth.

146
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:44,587
Is he really trying to end it like this?

147
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,720
All right, we're almost there.

148
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,795
Where are we right now?

149
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,186
Why did you bring us out to the middle of nowhere?

150
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:09,145
What is this?

151
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:09,887
Wait a sec.

152
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,253
I bet he brought us out here to let us go.

153
00:09:12,507 --> 00:09:13,472
This will do.

154
00:09:13,497 --> 00:09:16,151
It looks like there's nobody around to see us out here.

155
00:09:16,176 --> 00:09:20,658
I decided it would be better for us if I
brought you here, instead of the execution site.

156
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,243
Listen to me.

157
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:27,765
I'm going to kill you here, and then kill myself.

158
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:29,086
What?

159
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,811
What are you talking about, dad?

160
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:31,852
You can't, that's crazy!

161
00:09:31,877 --> 00:09:32,828
How can you say that?

162
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:34,520
You'd kill your only son for L?

163
00:09:34,545 --> 00:09:36,970
If you want to die so bad, why don't you kill yourself?

164
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:39,292
If you do this, you're not different than Kira.

165
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:41,020
I'm nothing like Kira.

166
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:45,866
I am bound by my responsibilities
as a parent, and as Chief of the MPA.

167
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,321
Dad, come on. She's right.

168
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,253
Think about it.

169
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:51,576
If we die here, the truth will never be revealed.

170
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:53,015
Please dad, you have to let us escape.

171
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,857
It's too late.

172
00:09:54,455 --> 00:09:56,595
Either way, you will be executed.

173
00:09:56,811 --> 00:10:00,112
At least with this, I'll be the one to do it.

174
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,590
Please, stop dad! I'm not Kira!

175
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,772
If I die here, Kira wins.

176
00:10:06,797 --> 00:10:07,895
Can't you see?

177
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,559
Amane, I'm going to die here with my son.

178
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:13,324
But I have no reason to kill you.

179
00:10:13,349 --> 00:10:15,059
Do you understand what I'm saying?

180
00:10:15,444 --> 00:10:18,435
It's only a matter of time
before the police locate this car.

181
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:22,278
Then they'll transport you to the
original site, and execute you there.

182
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:26,826
Light, my son.

183
00:10:27,313 --> 00:10:30,811
From one murderer to another, I'll see you in hell.

184
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:32,716
No, dad!

185
00:10:35,882 --> 00:10:38,396
No, stop it!

186
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,119
Light, my son.

187
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:56,040
From one murderer to another, I'll see you in hell.

188
00:10:56,065 --> 00:10:57,132
No, dad!

189
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,652
You... You used a blank?

190
00:11:22,196 --> 00:11:23,463
Thank goodness.

191
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:25,755
Thank goodness?

192
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,806
What's going on? I don't understand.

193
00:11:27,831 --> 00:11:29,792
Please, forgive me, you two.

194
00:11:29,817 --> 00:11:31,700
I know that was hard on you,

195
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:34,393
but it was the only way I could get you out of prison.

196
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:36,477
You must understand.

197
00:11:36,502 --> 00:11:40,398
I only agreed to do this because
I believe in your innocence, Light.

198
00:11:41,036 --> 00:11:42,652
Were you watching, Ryuzaki?

199
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:44,352
I did exactly as you said.

200
00:11:44,377 --> 00:11:46,853
And as you can see, I'm still alive.

201
00:11:47,953 --> 00:11:50,462
Yes, it was a convincing performance.

202
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,246
If Amane were the second Kira,

203
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:56,119
who only need to see a person's face to kill them,

204
00:11:56,144 --> 00:11:59,847
there is no doubt you would have killed you
before you had the chance to fire your weapon.

205
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:02,588
Also, if Light was in fact Kira,

206
00:12:02,727 --> 00:12:06,918
the Kira I know wouldn't hesitate to
kill even his own father to save himself.

207
00:12:06,968 --> 00:12:12,326
With Light in particular I cannot rule out the possibility
that he may have seen through our act at some point.

208
00:12:12,456 --> 00:12:16,114
However, as we agreed, I will
end their confinement immediately.

209
00:12:16,644 --> 00:12:21,820
And as we discussed, Amane will remain
under surveillance until Kira is apprehended.

210
00:12:22,128 --> 00:12:26,145
Although she insists the tapes
we found were just occult videos,

211
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,732
the physical evidence we have, plus
her confession, suggest otherwise.

212
00:12:29,835 --> 00:12:32,357
Hey, no fair! You still suspect me?

213
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,452
If I were you, I wouldn't complain.

214
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:36,596
You get to go back to your normal life.

215
00:12:36,694 --> 00:12:39,382
If you are innocent, the surveillance
shouldn't be a threat to you.

216
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:41,974
Think of it as complimentary police protection.

217
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:43,182
Oh, I get it.

218
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:48,078
Since I'm not the second Kira, it'll be kind
of like having my very own private bodyguards.

219
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,857
As for your part in this agreement, Light.

220
00:12:51,444 --> 00:12:54,121
You and I will be together 24/7.

221
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:57,825
And that's how we'll remain
until we've brought Kira to justice.

222
00:13:04,794 --> 00:13:05,805
Fine by me.

223
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:07,373
We'll catch Kira.

224
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:08,815
Together.

225
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:11,859
Yes, I look forward to working with you.

226
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:18,550
Are you sure this is necessary, Ryuzaki?

227
00:13:18,793 --> 00:13:21,627
This is as difficult for me as it is for you.

228
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:25,538
So is this what you meant by being
together 24 hours a day with him?

229
00:13:25,563 --> 00:13:27,409
Looking at you, I never would have guessed.

230
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:29,736
Are you on that side of the fence, Ryuzaki?

231
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:32,634
I told you, I'm not doing this because I want to, OK?

232
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:33,892
But Light belongs to me.

233
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:35,498
I don't want to share him with you.

234
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,236
If you're with him 24/7, then how
are we supposed to go on dates together?

235
00:13:39,261 --> 00:13:40,921
Oh, you can still go on dates.

236
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,377
But it will have to be the three of us.

237
00:13:42,402 --> 00:13:43,292
No way.

238
00:13:43,317 --> 00:13:45,875
Are you telling me we have to
kiss in front of you, and stuff?

239
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,625
I'm not telling you to do anything.

240
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,816
But yes, I suppose I would be watching.

241
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:50,780
That's so gross.

242
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:52,584
You really are a pervert, aren't you?

243
00:13:52,609 --> 00:13:55,348
Light, please make Misa stop talking now.

244
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,702
Listen, Misa, that's enough.

245
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:01,098
The police have already established
that it was you who sent those tapes,

246
00:14:01,123 --> 00:14:02,986
so you're lucky to even be here right now.

247
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:04,143
They have every right to keep you in prison.

248
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,500
Huh? How could you even say that, Light?

249
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:08,323
In case you forgot, I'm your girlfriend.

250
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,254
Don't you trust your own soul mate?

251
00:14:10,843 --> 00:14:12,302
What do you mean, soul mate?

252
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:15,115
You're the one who said you fell
in love with me at first sight, Misa.

253
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,919
Huh?

254
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:18,363
So why would you kiss me if
you didn't have feelings for me?

255
00:14:18,388 --> 00:14:20,098
You took advantage of me?

256
00:14:20,648 --> 00:14:21,794
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

257
00:14:21,836 --> 00:14:23,971
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

258
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,973
About this love at first sight,

259
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:29,161
it happened in Oyama on May 22nd, didn't it?

260
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:30,571
So what?

261
00:14:30,596 --> 00:14:32,971
Why did you choose that day to go to Oyama?

262
00:14:32,996 --> 00:14:34,907
And do you remember what you wore?

263
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,235
It's like I told you.

264
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:37,628
I just happened to go there.

265
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:42,088
I don't know why, I don't remember how I
felt, and I don't even know what I was wearing.

266
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:45,887
Anyway, since when do I need a
reason to hang out in Oyama, huh?

267
00:14:46,193 --> 00:14:48,736
And somehow, when you came back from Oyama,

268
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:51,165
you knew you that you were in love with
some guy, and that his name was Light.

269
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:51,823
Yes.

270
00:14:51,848 --> 00:14:55,044
And yet you yourself have no
idea how you came to know his name.

271
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:56,171
Yeah, so what?

272
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,368
Tell me, what if light was Kira?

273
00:14:58,486 --> 00:14:59,586
How would it make you feel?

274
00:14:59,611 --> 00:15:00,183
Huh?

275
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:02,109
How would I feel if Light was Kira?

276
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:03,135
That's right.

277
00:15:05,635 --> 00:15:07,102
That'd be wonderful.

278
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:11,392
I mean, I've always been grateful to Kira
for punishing the men who murdered my parents,

279
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:13,492
so if I found out that Light was actually Kira?

280
00:15:13,517 --> 00:15:15,030
That would be like a bonus for me.

281
00:15:15,055 --> 00:15:17,430
If anything, it would make me love him even more.

282
00:15:17,455 --> 00:15:20,534
Even though it's like, practically
impossible to love him more than I already do.

283
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,492
It's Kira, though.

284
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:22,996
You'd love him even more for that?

285
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:24,354
I mean, wouldn't you be afraid?

286
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:25,607
What if he tried to kill you?

287
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:27,863
You're talking about Light being Kira?

288
00:15:27,888 --> 00:15:29,848
He wouldn't be scary at all.

289
00:15:29,873 --> 00:15:33,510
I'm a supporter of Kira, so if I
found out my Light was actually him,

290
00:15:33,535 --> 00:15:35,431
I'd think of how I could be helpful.

291
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:41,720
That's very generous of you, but I'm
pretty sure Kira doesn't need your help.

292
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:46,767
Well, Misa, based on what you just told me,
there can be no mistake that you are the second Kira.

293
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:50,494
But you've made it so painfully obvious
that I don't really want to believe it.

294
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,604
Whatever. It's not believable,
because I'm not the second Kira, OK?

295
00:15:54,924 --> 00:15:57,949
Anyway, for the time being,
you'll remain under surveillance.

296
00:15:57,974 --> 00:16:02,070
When you do go out, if needed, you'll be
able to contact us using this room's extension.

297
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,271
For the most, your life will return to normal.

298
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,032
But from now on, for all private and work related affairs,

299
00:16:07,057 --> 00:16:10,642
Mr. Matsuda will be accompanying
you as your new manager, Matsui.

300
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:11,312
Matsui here!

301
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,863
Your agency's been paid to keep
quiet, and the police don't know.

302
00:16:13,888 --> 00:16:14,953
Don't blow his cover.

303
00:16:14,978 --> 00:16:17,582
This old guy's my manager? Oh, you can't be serious.

304
00:16:17,607 --> 00:16:19,769
Oh, come on! What's wrong with me, Misa Misa?

305
00:16:19,794 --> 00:16:21,516
Is it the tie? Because I can get a...

306
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:28,055
Would you cut it out with all this
dating, kissing, and Misa Misa talk all ready?

307
00:16:28,093 --> 00:16:31,261
This is the Kira investigation. Stop messing around.

308
00:16:31,353 --> 00:16:33,140
Sorry about that, Ayuzawa.

309
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:37,763
No, it's all right. I just
figured out what the problem is.

310
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,735
Misa Amane, it's time for you to go to your room.

311
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,570
Why?

312
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:43,726
Out you go!

313
00:16:43,751 --> 00:16:45,035
Don't, no!

314
00:16:45,126 --> 00:16:48,189
Hey Light, let's go on a date,
even if it is the three of us.

315
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:52,718
So Light, are you serious about her?

316
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:53,888
No way.

317
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:56,222
Like I told you earlier, it's completely onesided.

318
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:59,872
Then could you at least pretend to be
serious, for the sake of the investigation?

319
00:16:59,897 --> 00:17:02,264
There are two things I know about Amane for sure.

320
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:04,256
One, that she's involved in this.

321
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:07,034
Two, she's in love with you.

322
00:17:07,703 --> 00:17:12,191
You want me to become intimate with her
to gather information about the second Kira?

323
00:17:12,216 --> 00:17:15,026
Yes, I think you could do it
without arousing her suspicions.

324
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:18,385
And Amane would definitely be a
valuable source of information for us.

325
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,086
Not to mention this is the main reason
why I agreed to release the two of you.

326
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:24,342
Ryuzaki...

327
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:29,050
as much as I want to help you, and as
important as the Kira cases is to me,

328
00:17:29,075 --> 00:17:31,421
I can't manipulate a woman's feelings like that.

329
00:17:33,642 --> 00:17:35,466
Please try to understand.

330
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:39,381
To me, exploiting other person's
feelings for personal gain is unforgivable,

331
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:41,802
and I won't allow myself to stoop that low.

332
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:44,250
There's something wrong with this picture.

333
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:47,021
It's as if he's a different person now.

334
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,469
Is it possible this is an act?

335
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:55,073
If this is genuine, it not only implies
that Amane was being controlled by Kira,

336
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:56,880
by Light Yagami, too.

337
00:17:58,026 --> 00:17:59,355
What's wrong, Ryuzaki?

338
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:02,048
Nothing. I suppose you're right after all.

339
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,734
However, considering Misa will
have a lot of contact with the public,

340
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,708
it would be helpful if you could
make sure she doesn't leak information.

341
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:12,590
By the way, do you think we could
come up with some kind of alternative

342
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:15,823
to this system of moving from
hotel to hotel every few days?

343
00:18:15,955 --> 00:18:18,859
Yes. In fact, I had that very same thought some time ago.

344
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:22,851
And so I arranged for a facility to be built.

345
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:27,035
Construction started right after my
first meeting with Mr. Yagami and the others.

346
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,560
It should be finished in a few days.

347
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:31,702
Where is it? Here it is.

348
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:36,687
23 floors above ground, and 2 below.

349
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,118
Although it's impossible to see it from the outside,

350
00:18:39,143 --> 00:18:41,310
there are two helicopters hidden on the roof.

351
00:18:41,335 --> 00:18:41,980
What?

352
00:18:42,213 --> 00:18:43,686
That's amazing.

353
00:18:44,055 --> 00:18:47,240
Ideally I want all of us to
spend as much time here as possible.

354
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,728
If the investigation team grows,
we can accommodate up to 60 people.

355
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:54,947
Misa shouldn't have any complaints.
And she'll have her own floor.

356
00:18:56,022 --> 00:18:57,956
This is truly impressive.

357
00:18:57,981 --> 00:18:59,307
But to go to such lengths.

358
00:18:59,332 --> 00:19:00,195
Hold on a second.

359
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,945
Where did you find the finances to build this thing?

360
00:19:03,313 --> 00:19:07,929
As you can see, it is my intention to
solve this case, no matter what it takes.

361
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:09,235
That's how it is.

362
00:19:09,394 --> 00:19:11,227
I'm sorry, but how is that an answer?

363
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:12,424
No, he's right.

364
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,785
The mass killings are bad enough already.

365
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:19,276
But personally, I will never forgive
Kira for putting my dad and I through this.

366
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,212
I want to solve this, no matter what it takes.

367
00:19:22,237 --> 00:19:26,271
If you're serious about that, you should try to
get close to Misa and find out about the second book.

368
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:28,720
I can't. That goes against my principles.

369
00:19:28,785 --> 00:19:30,289
Right. You said that.

370
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:31,849
And what a shame.

371
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,450
Hm?

372
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:36,941
Nothing. I'm just feeling
really motivated right now, Chief.

373
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,439
Ryuzaki, Chief Yagami, Light,

374
00:19:39,464 --> 00:19:41,848
let's get out of here and bring Kira to justice.

375
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:45,996
Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice you missed my name.

376
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:57,127
Well.

377
00:19:57,275 --> 00:19:58,875
This looks like all of us.

378
00:19:59,242 --> 00:20:00,887
Let's get started, shall we?

379
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:05,941
We're all here to further the growth of
the Yotsuba Group by reducing competition.

380
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,473
So the question is, who is going to die?

381
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:13,674
I'm not thrilled that we have
to do this every single week.

382
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:15,775
This may be irrelevant, but I have to wonder,

383
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,100
what prompted Kira to start killing business people,

384
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,333
in addition to the usual criminals and such?

385
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:23,359
Come on now, haven't you figured this out yet, Takahashi?

386
00:20:23,384 --> 00:20:23,809
Hm?

387
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:28,219
This is the most advantageous course of action for Kira.

388
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:29,741
Advantageous?

389
00:20:29,831 --> 00:20:32,565
He's basically started a killing service, Higuchi.

390
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,671
You have a lot to say, considering how stupid you are.

391
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:38,112
I'd hate to see you get killed because of it.

392
00:20:38,974 --> 00:20:41,611
Despite the fact that we're all relatively young,

393
00:20:41,922 --> 00:20:45,548
all of us are now front-runners
to become Yotsuba's next CEO.

394
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:47,098
Not to mention,

395
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,618
our salaries have virtually eclipsed
those of the other employees in the company.

396
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:55,853
It's unlikely he would choose
to back a particular company,

397
00:20:56,284 --> 00:20:57,761
no matter how you look at it.

398
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,287
One of the people in this room has to be Kira.

399
00:21:06,994 --> 00:21:09,160
So, back to business.

400
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,818
Does anyone have a proposal?

401
00:21:11,046 --> 00:21:14,083
Who should we have Kira eliminate this week, gentleman?

402
00:21:16,112 --> 00:21:21,613
Human beings are truly disgusting creatures.

403
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:39,555
It's no good.

404
00:22:39,841 --> 00:22:44,208
It's obvious from the way you talk that you
won't be satisfied until I'm convicted as Kira.

405
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,053
Stop this, Ryuzaki!
