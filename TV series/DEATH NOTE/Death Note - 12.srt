1
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:33,699
Light, Ryuzaki has decided that he'd
like you to help with the investigation.

2
00:01:33,795 --> 00:01:36,397
If you're still interested, then
you need to come here right away.

3
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:37,848
OK, Dad.

4
00:01:40,512 --> 00:01:44,409
All along, I've been trying to find a
way to get involved in the investigation,

5
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:46,824
but I never thought they would actually approach me.

6
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:50,246
Now, I'll have access to
classified information about the case,

7
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,224
which means I can learn more about this other Kira.

8
00:01:53,343 --> 00:01:58,550
I need to figure out what this impostor is all about
before someone else on the task force beats me to it.

9
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,466
Thank you, Light.

10
00:02:01,678 --> 00:02:02,749
Not at all.

11
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:06,040
After all, I want to catch Kira as much as you do, Ryuga.

12
00:02:06,224 --> 00:02:08,688
I'll have to ask that you call me Ryuzaki here.

13
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:09,289
Eh?

14
00:02:09,498 --> 00:02:10,605
I'm Matsui.

15
00:02:10,657 --> 00:02:11,791
I'm Aihara.

16
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:13,262
And I'm Asahi.

17
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:15,810
Yes, of course.

18
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,818
Then perhaps I should call myself Light Asahi?

19
00:02:19,158 --> 00:02:20,524
Yes, please do.

20
00:02:20,653 --> 00:02:23,477
To keep things simple from this
point on, I'll call you Light.

21
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:25,853
OK, let's get down to work.

22
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:29,085
You can start by looking over
all the information we've collected.

23
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,438
I'd also like you to examine these videos.

24
00:02:31,463 --> 00:02:34,024
They were sent to the TV station but were never aired.

25
00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:38,763
For security reasons, you're not permitted to
take notes, and all materials must remain here.

26
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:40,018
I understand.

27
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:41,320
We will begin now.

28
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:45,697
Light.

29
00:02:48,957 --> 00:02:49,867
Well, then.

30
00:02:50,015 --> 00:02:52,456
We need to ask Light Yagami to assist us.

31
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:56,689
However, we cannot tell him that we're
considering the possibility of a second Kira.

32
00:02:56,827 --> 00:02:58,018
Are you serious?

33
00:02:58,043 --> 00:03:00,486
But wouldn't that make working together a bit difficult?

34
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:01,409
He's right.

35
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:03,629
Why even bother asking him to work with us?

36
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:06,362
Well, I didn't mean indefinitely.

37
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:10,853
I'm curious to see what his impression of
these tapes will be prior to knowing hours.

38
00:03:10,913 --> 00:03:13,966
Light's deductive reasoning is really quite incredible.

39
00:03:14,037 --> 00:03:20,192
He may suspect that these tapes are the work of a second
Kira, an impostor or copycat imitating the original.

40
00:03:20,217 --> 00:03:22,143
But the basis for the second Kira theory

41
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:26,462
is that the victims of these recent killings were
minor criminals who don't fit the normal profile.

42
00:03:26,487 --> 00:03:28,129
Without hearing our explanation,

43
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:29,564
how would Light ever know that?

44
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:31,151
Yes, but there's more to it than that.

45
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:31,652
Huh?

46
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:37,795
The suspect that we've been pursuing up until now
has needed both a need and a face to kill his victims.

47
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,120
But there is something different happening here.

48
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:44,056
Recall that Mr. Ukita was killed
the moment he arrived at the station.

49
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:49,347
And this Kira demanded only that I appear
on TV but made no request for my name.

50
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,528
This implies that the second Kira only
needs to see a person's face to kill them.

51
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:58,483
So I'll ask Light to look over all of our
information, as well as our video evidence.

52
00:03:58,508 --> 00:04:01,677
If he comes to the conclusion
that there could be a second suspect,

53
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:04,777
then he'd be almost completely
cleared of suspicion in this case.

54
00:04:04,802 --> 00:04:06,191
But how will that prove anything?

55
00:04:07,405 --> 00:04:10,143
Logically, if he's really Kira, he'll want me dead,

56
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:13,196
seeing as I'm the one leading the
investigation against him right now.

57
00:04:13,405 --> 00:04:16,647
And the way things are going, if I
comply with this new subject's demands

58
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:20,396
and appear on TV in three days,
there's a very good chance I will die.

59
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:25,787
I can't see the real Kira jeopardizing
such an easy opportunity to get rid of me.

60
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:26,589
OK.

61
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:29,661
But are you suggesting that if my son
does not come to the same conclusion,

62
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,779
there's an even greater chance that he is guilty?

63
00:04:31,873 --> 00:04:32,557
No.

64
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:35,785
In that case, there will still only be a 5% chance.

65
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:39,283
We'll inform him that we are
investigating the possibility of a copycat

66
00:04:39,308 --> 00:04:41,774
and have him cooperate with us as planned.

67
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:43,349
Hmm.

68
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,389
Now that you've seen proof of my powers, you
should have no trouble believing that I am Kira.

69
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:51,530
On the designated...

70
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:53,584
This video is so mediocre.

71
00:04:53,653 --> 00:04:55,755
It's making me sick to my stomach.

72
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,001
I don't know, maybe it's because I'm the real one,

73
00:04:58,026 --> 00:05:01,895
but this is a complete disgrace
to everything Kira stands for.

74
00:05:03,272 --> 00:05:04,754
Something's not right here.

75
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:08,270
It seems unusual that no one
bothered to explain this video to me.

76
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:09,670
It's not like them.

77
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:12,713
Well, in any case, I'd be stupid to comment on it.

78
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:14,720
It's probably best thing if I say nothing.

79
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:17,597
If I just leave it alone, L dies.

80
00:05:17,962 --> 00:05:19,754
So what do you make of this, Light?

81
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:21,631
Have you come to any conclusions?

82
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:22,622
Hmm?

83
00:05:25,054 --> 00:05:26,689
Damn, it's a test.

84
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:28,942
It's hard to say for sure,

85
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:31,556
but there might be another
person out there with Kira's power.

86
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,175
With Kira's power?

87
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:35,161
But what do you mean by that, Light?

88
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:39,469
At the very least, I'd say this tape was
not created by the Kira we're familiar with.

89
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:44,376
It's extremely out of character for him to
use these kinds of victims for his killings.

90
00:05:44,628 --> 00:05:47,580
And since we've established that
he needs a name and face to kill,

91
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:51,155
it makes you wonder how he was able to
kill that detective and those two officers

92
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,289
right outside the television station like that.

93
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,010
I... It's the same.

94
00:05:56,035 --> 00:05:59,624
That's almost exactly how L, I mean, Ryuzaki said it.

95
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:01,795
That was incredible, Light.

96
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,394
Now any doubts about you should be resolved.

97
00:06:05,363 --> 00:06:07,468
I think you're exactly right about that.

98
00:06:07,738 --> 00:06:10,757
We also believe that this is the work of a second Kira.

99
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,052
I knew it.

100
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:16,273
So you knew about this all along, Ryuga, sorry, Ryuzaki?

101
00:06:16,568 --> 00:06:19,132
Which means this was just another one of your tests?

102
00:06:19,157 --> 00:06:21,164
It wasn't my intention to test you.

103
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,989
The truth is if I was the only one who thought
there was a second Kira, it wouldn't be too convincing.

104
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,984
But the fact that we both came to the same
conclusion makes the theory that much more believable.

105
00:06:31,234 --> 00:06:33,616
As expected, you did not disappoint us.

106
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:35,058
You've been a great help.

107
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:37,107
It's decided, then.

108
00:06:37,577 --> 00:06:40,639
First, we must focus on stopping this copycat.

109
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:45,553
From what we've seen, he sympathizes with the
real Kira but clearly lacks his sophistication.

110
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:48,907
I think he might even be willing to obey the original.

111
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:51,839
If so, we could lure him into a trap

112
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:54,589
by sending our own message from the real Kira.

113
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,122
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

114
00:06:57,179 --> 00:06:59,704
You literally took the words right out of my mouth.

115
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:02,180
Oh, and Light,

116
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:05,502
I would like you to play the part of the real Kira.

117
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:06,437
Huh?

118
00:07:06,545 --> 00:07:07,988
Me as Kira?

119
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:08,803
Yes.

120
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:12,400
You're the only one I can think of who'd
be able to pull something like this off.

121
00:07:12,877 --> 00:07:14,786
At any rate, we don't have time to waste.

122
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:17,731
Do you think you could script a message from Kira in time

123
00:07:17,756 --> 00:07:20,171
for it to be aired on this evening's national news?

124
00:07:21,648 --> 00:07:22,814
Damn him.

125
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:25,119
He must have been planning this from the beginning.

126
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:27,136
It's the only reason I'm here.

127
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,388
Ryuzaki, does this look OK?

128
00:07:31,135 --> 00:07:33,003
I think I managed to make it believable.

129
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,511
Mm, I think you've done an excellent job with this.

130
00:07:37,536 --> 00:07:42,549
However, if we don't omit the part that says
you're free to kill L, then I'm going to end up dead.

131
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:45,183
Uh, sorry.

132
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,412
I guess I got carried away playing the part.

133
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:50,371
I figured if I was him, I'd
probably demand that you'd be killed.

134
00:07:51,107 --> 00:07:52,786
I was improvising.

135
00:07:52,868 --> 00:07:55,945
Feel free to change it to
whatever you like. That sounds good.

136
00:07:57,691 --> 00:07:58,584
OK, Aihara.

137
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:00,388
The script is ready. I'll leave it to you.

138
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:01,288
All right.

139
00:08:02,452 --> 00:08:04,405
And now, a shocking announcement.

140
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:09,240
In response to the frightening Kira
video aired on Sakura TV only a few days ago,

141
00:08:09,265 --> 00:08:12,945
an anonymous individual has contacted
us claiming to be the real Kira.

142
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:16,130
In short, he has demanded of this network,

143
00:08:16,216 --> 00:08:18,696
as well as several others, that we air the message

144
00:08:18,721 --> 00:08:20,119
you are now about to see.

145
00:08:20,462 --> 00:08:24,523
I would also like to mention that the NPA
has granted us permission to air this video.

146
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:26,691
Is this the real Kira?

147
00:08:26,743 --> 00:08:28,143
No one knows for sure.

148
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:31,959
But we can only hope this video will
provide us with some much needed answers.

149
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,556
I am Kira.

150
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:35,825
It worked!

151
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:37,687
I knew he'd answer me.

152
00:08:37,712 --> 00:08:39,312
The true Kira.

153
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:43,800
The one who was broadcast on Sakura
TV several days ago is a pretender,

154
00:08:43,844 --> 00:08:44,822
a fake.

155
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:49,730
The purpose of this message is to
communicate my will to this impostor.

156
00:08:49,772 --> 00:08:52,468
I have chosen to be lenient with him for the time being

157
00:08:52,493 --> 00:08:57,107
only because I believe he wishes to
cooperate with me in the creation of a new world.

158
00:08:57,424 --> 00:09:02,496
But I want to make it absolutely clear that
the taking of innocent lives is against my will.

159
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:05,428
If this person claiming to be me is truly sympathetic to

160
00:09:05,453 --> 00:09:07,468
my cause and wishes to be of some help,

161
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:08,912
I ask two things of him.

162
00:09:08,937 --> 00:09:11,073
That he refrain from killing aimlessly,

163
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:13,416
and that he agree to abide by my basic principles.

164
00:09:13,557 --> 00:09:14,488
Yay!

165
00:09:14,565 --> 00:09:16,620
Now where is that camcorder?

166
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,478
What are you planning to do?

167
00:09:18,503 --> 00:09:20,427
Uh, hello? Do you really need to ask?

168
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:22,824
I'm going to reply to him, of course.

169
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:26,620
Ryuzaki, we have a reply from the second Kira.

170
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:27,835
What?

171
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,682
Really?

172
00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:31,715
I will be bringing over the
envelope and tape that we received.

173
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,884
But in the meantime, I'm streaming a copy
of the video so you can view it on your end.

174
00:09:39,043 --> 00:09:41,132
Kira, thank you for your reply.

175
00:09:41,157 --> 00:09:42,370
Please do not worry.

176
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:44,737
I will follow orders and do as you say.

177
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,696
Whoa.

178
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:46,772
It worked.

179
00:09:46,797 --> 00:09:48,978
"I will do as you say," huh?

180
00:09:49,161 --> 00:09:51,195
This guy's going to be no help at all.

181
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,095
If this fake had any idea what my wishes were,

182
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,569
he'd insist that L appear on TV and then kill him anyway.

183
00:09:57,617 --> 00:09:59,864
How could you fall for something like this?

184
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:01,248
Damn it.

185
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:04,257
I really want to meet you.

186
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,800
I don't think you have the eyes.

187
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,430
But you don't have to worry.
I would never try to kill you.

188
00:10:10,682 --> 00:10:11,963
That's a promise.

189
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,919
What the hell is he thinking, talking about
Shinigami eyes in a public message like this?

190
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,417
What's this "having the eyes" supposed to mean?

191
00:10:21,444 --> 00:10:22,251
Is it a code?

192
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:23,196
Yeah.

193
00:10:23,804 --> 00:10:27,041
Please tell me how I can meet
you without the police knowing.

194
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:28,299
You'll think of something.

195
00:10:28,371 --> 00:10:33,594
And when we meet, we can confirm our
identities by showing our Shinigami to each other.

196
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,933
Shinigami?

197
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,295
He's a liability.

198
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,590
If I don't do something about him quickly...

199
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,980
Ryuzaki!

200
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,496
You all right?

201
00:10:50,553 --> 00:10:52,711
Sh... Shinigami?

202
00:10:53,932 --> 00:10:55,716
Am I supposed to believe that,

203
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:58,205
that Shinigami actually exist?

204
00:11:09,146 --> 00:11:10,952
Sh... Shinigami?

205
00:11:12,153 --> 00:11:14,008
Am I supposed to believe that,

206
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,097
that Shinigami actually exist?

207
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,436
That's impossible.

208
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,699
Obviously, they don't exist.

209
00:11:21,104 --> 00:11:22,774
Yes, that's right, Ryuzaki.

210
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,410
Listen to yourself. Of course Shinigami don't exist.

211
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,298
Hmm.

212
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:29,559
You're probably right, but I remember

213
00:11:29,584 --> 00:11:34,001
that Kira had those prisoners write
something suggesting the existence of Shinigami.

214
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,849
So based on that fact,

215
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,666
perhaps we're dealing with the same person after all.

216
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:41,776
That would definitely explain
why we're hearing the same words.

217
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,487
I don't think so because if this was the same person,

218
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:49,452
it's highly unlikely he would have
responded to our video in the first place.

219
00:11:49,683 --> 00:11:51,583
And why would he agree to let L live

220
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:54,708
after going to all the trouble
of getting him to appear on TV?

221
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:56,433
The real Kira wants him dead.

222
00:11:56,478 --> 00:11:57,821
So it doesn't make sense.

223
00:11:57,846 --> 00:12:01,168
Then maybe there's some other connection
between the real one and this new guy.

224
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:05,345
They could have already met and decided to
use the word Shinigami as a way to confuse us.

225
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,088
No, I'd say that's unlikely.

226
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:07,946
Hmm?

227
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:09,563
It's as Light says.

228
00:12:09,588 --> 00:12:11,246
If the two Kiras were connected,

229
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:14,907
I don't think the impostor would be so
willing to give up on his plan to kill me.

230
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:21,007
All of this suggests to me that the copycat has his
own agenda and is acting independently of the first.

231
00:12:21,745 --> 00:12:24,999
I believe his actual motivation is to meet the original.

232
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:26,656
I think you're right.

233
00:12:26,858 --> 00:12:29,027
He's acting out of an interest in Kira.

234
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:34,107
The word "Shinigami" could very well
be some reference to their killing power.

235
00:12:34,697 --> 00:12:38,714
Saying, "We can confirm our identities
by showing our Shinigami to each other"

236
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:43,565
probably means that they'd confirm their identities
by somehow demonstrating their ability to kill.

237
00:12:44,026 --> 00:12:45,690
Yes, that's it.

238
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:50,880
Based on their messages, we can assume that
the word "Shinigami" must hold some other meaning

239
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:54,414
that only the real Kira and the second Kira are aware of.

240
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:58,272
Now, we just need to convince
this copycat to tell us what that is.

241
00:12:59,216 --> 00:13:01,883
So will you respond and force him to be more specific?

242
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:03,841
We have to be careful how we handle this.

243
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:08,455
We can't make it too obvious that we're
asking, otherwise he'll realize we're not Kira.

244
00:13:08,774 --> 00:13:10,601
No, from now on,

245
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:13,246
it's best that we leave it up to the two Kiras.

246
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:14,038
Huh?

247
00:13:14,063 --> 00:13:14,989
What do you mean?

248
00:13:15,164 --> 00:13:17,943
I imagine that the second Kira is probably

249
00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:20,101
quite satisfied with the current situation

250
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:22,886
now that he's received a televised response.

251
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:25,610
He sent a message to get Kira's attention.

252
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:27,921
And as far as he knows, he now has it.

253
00:13:28,002 --> 00:13:32,925
Also, there's that word he used, one
that only the two of them would understand.

254
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,269
We'll arrange to have this reply
broadcast today on Sakura 6 o'clock news.

255
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:39,506
Naturally, this will be of interest to Kira,

256
00:13:39,531 --> 00:13:43,988
and he'll be following this exchange
between the copycat and the one we've invented.

257
00:13:44,244 --> 00:13:48,539
Now, if I were Kira himself, my
priority would be to prevent this impostor

258
00:13:48,564 --> 00:13:50,743
from coming into contact with the police.

259
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:56,312
This is good for us because it means that the
real Kira may feel pressure to respond this time.

260
00:13:56,883 --> 00:13:57,617
OK.

261
00:13:57,648 --> 00:13:59,115
But let's say that he doesn't respond.

262
00:13:59,174 --> 00:14:00,276
Then what do we do?

263
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:01,133
Yes.

264
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:05,158
I've been thinking about what the second
Kira might do if he gets no response.

265
00:14:05,265 --> 00:14:09,575
For one, he might reveal more information
that he knows Kira wants kept secret,

266
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:11,303
to pressure him into a meeting.

267
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:13,878
Of course, that would make Kira nervous.

268
00:14:14,216 --> 00:14:16,130
It could be interesting.

269
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:18,477
And what would be more interesting

270
00:14:18,502 --> 00:14:21,920
is if Kira sends a message of his
own to prevent this from happening.

271
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:26,796
Ideally, this could provide us with the physical
evidence we'll need to build a case against him.

272
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:31,275
In the meantime, let's gather all
the information we can on this copycat.

273
00:14:36,271 --> 00:14:37,350
Oh, that's good.

274
00:14:37,648 --> 00:14:38,781
Yes.

275
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:39,812
Beautiful.

276
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:40,645
Just like that.

277
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,630
Perfect.

278
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:44,664
I'm telling you, these are gonna knock them dead.

279
00:14:44,998 --> 00:14:47,763
You'll look like a little angel, Misa.

280
00:14:47,813 --> 00:14:49,755
Ah, I'm so tired.

281
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,438
That shoot went on forever.

282
00:14:51,463 --> 00:14:53,619
Modeling takes a lot of energy.

283
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:55,853
Hey, Rem.

284
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:56,763
Huh?

285
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,908
Can I ask you something?

286
00:14:59,111 --> 00:15:00,142
What is it?

287
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,652
Each Shinigami has to have one Death Note of their own.

288
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:06,360
For a Shinigami to give a notebook to a human,

289
00:15:06,385 --> 00:15:07,888
he needs to have two.

290
00:15:07,913 --> 00:15:10,176
Ryuk could give a Death Note to Kira

291
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:14,553
because he somehow found a way to sneak
an extra one past the Shinigami King?

292
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:15,626
Right.

293
00:15:16,221 --> 00:15:17,621
What about you?

294
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,053
The Shinigami King isn't someone who's easily fooled.

295
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:22,628
It doesn't happen often.

296
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:24,335
Oh, then how did I get mine?

297
00:15:25,002 --> 00:15:27,355
Let's just say it has a lot to do with the fact

298
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,880
that I'm one of the few in the Shinigami realm

299
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:32,242
who knows how to kill another of my kind.

300
00:15:32,893 --> 00:15:34,905
That's how I ended up with two.

301
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:37,260
Oh. I think I get it.

302
00:15:37,385 --> 00:15:40,930
You killed a Shinigami, and then
you gave his notebook to me, right?

303
00:15:41,099 --> 00:15:42,450
It's not like that.

304
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,485
I wasn't the one who killed him.

305
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:47,055
I just happened to be around when he died.

306
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,109
It was coincidence, really.

307
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:52,088
So how do you kill a Shinigami?

308
00:15:52,113 --> 00:15:53,253
I have to know.

309
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:54,700
Well?

310
00:15:54,725 --> 00:15:56,730
Never repeat this to anyone.

311
00:15:57,792 --> 00:16:00,766
I learned the only way to kill a Shinigami

312
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:04,470
is to make them fall in love with a human.

313
00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:10,044
What a beautiful way to kill.

314
00:16:17,925 --> 00:16:20,854
There once was a Shinigami named Gelus

315
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,783
who spent all of his time
watching over a certain human girl.

316
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:30,349
Gelus wanted nothing more than to look
at her as she went about her daily life.

317
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:42,541
It's today, isn't it?

318
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:44,195
Her last day alive.

319
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,390
She looks so full of life.

320
00:16:48,044 --> 00:16:49,605
I wonder why today?

321
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:53,666
It's... it's just not fair.

322
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:02,219
I also wanted to find out how she was going to die,

323
00:17:02,273 --> 00:17:04,418
so I stayed and watched with him.

324
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,641
It was nighttime, and she was walking alone.

325
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,481
No one else was around.

326
00:17:12,663 --> 00:17:14,257
And then it happened.

327
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,379
A man suddenly appeared and blocked her path.

328
00:17:21,451 --> 00:17:23,863
He was clearly infatuated with the girl.

329
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:26,291
I love you more than anyone else in the world!

330
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:27,117
I'm always watching you.

331
00:17:27,142 --> 00:17:28,892
I want to protect you forever!

332
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:31,029
She'd never seen the man before

333
00:17:31,054 --> 00:17:33,343
and, of course, turned him down.

334
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:42,084
Then if I can't have you,

335
00:17:42,702 --> 00:17:45,482
I'll kill us both!

336
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:52,760
Wait! Stop it! What are you doing?

337
00:17:55,264 --> 00:17:56,544
Without even thinking,

338
00:17:56,569 --> 00:17:59,697
Gelus did something that we Shinigami must never do.

339
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,750
Gelus used his Death Note to kill the man instantly

340
00:18:18,775 --> 00:18:21,116
and therefore saved the girl's life.

341
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:23,259
it was the wrong thing to do.

342
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,589
Shinigami exist only to shorten and take human lives.

343
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:31,560
We aren't permitted to undo that which has been fated.

344
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:50,736
At that moment, Gelus became something

345
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:54,688
which was neither sand nor rust and disappeared forever.

346
00:18:55,074 --> 00:18:56,143
He died.

347
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:00,027
The only reminder of his existence was his Death Note,

348
00:19:00,243 --> 00:19:01,511
left behind.

349
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:06,886
The rest of his life span was added to hers.

350
00:19:06,964 --> 00:19:09,431
So not only had he saved her life,

351
00:19:09,456 --> 00:19:13,276
he'd accidentally extended it well beyond its natural end.

352
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:16,971
So if he'd never fallen in love with this girl,

353
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:19,542
he'd probably still be alive today, wouldn't he?

354
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:20,842
That's right.

355
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,240
Hmm.

356
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:26,352
I had no idea.

357
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,591
All this time, I thought it was luck.

358
00:19:28,616 --> 00:19:31,375
But it was a Shinigami who saved my life that day.

359
00:19:32,477 --> 00:19:33,496
Yes.

360
00:19:34,063 --> 00:19:36,691
Gelus loved you enough to die for you.

361
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:40,401
So that Death Note is now yours to keep.

362
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:42,847
Hmm.

363
00:19:46,963 --> 00:19:48,297
I see.

364
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:53,200
For a Shinigami to die, they have to love a human
enough that they'd prevent their death from happening.

365
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,804
So what about you, Rem?

366
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:56,409
You're not in love with me, are you?

367
00:19:56,434 --> 00:19:57,332
Be honest.

368
00:19:57,588 --> 00:19:58,854
Just forget it.

369
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:01,621
You really think you can kill me that easily?

370
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,834
Oops. You saw through that?

371
00:20:05,854 --> 00:20:07,201
I'm so glad.

372
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:10,037
At least now I have something interesting to tell Kira.

373
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:16,775
But I wonder, does he know how to KILL a Shinigami?

374
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,154
I asked him on TV to find a way for us to meet each other,

375
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:21,820
but he hasn't replied to me yet.

376
00:20:21,968 --> 00:20:23,921
What's taking him so long?

377
00:20:24,062 --> 00:20:26,341
Maybe I should just send him another message.

378
00:20:30,387 --> 00:20:31,603
This isn't good.

379
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:34,991
I can't allow this second Kira
to act on his own for much longer.

380
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:35,996
He's careless.

381
00:20:36,021 --> 00:20:38,366
So it's only a matter of time before he slips up.

382
00:20:38,391 --> 00:20:40,355
And when he does, the police will be waiting.

383
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:44,075
With him in custody, they could
find out about the Death Note.

384
00:20:46,469 --> 00:20:47,574
Something to start?

385
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:48,689
Hmm.

386
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,692
A strawberry sundae, please.

387
00:20:50,854 --> 00:20:52,437
Of course. Be right back.

388
00:20:53,851 --> 00:20:55,726
What should I do?

389
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:59,650
How can I contact the second
Kira without L noticing anything?

390
00:21:00,654 --> 00:21:02,681
Here you go. Enjoy.

391
00:21:05,638 --> 00:21:06,540
Mm.

392
00:21:06,824 --> 00:21:09,045
I can't wait to meet Kira!

393
00:21:09,562 --> 00:21:14,180
I wonder, what kind of person are you, impostor?

394
00:21:14,602 --> 00:21:18,061
I wonder, what kind of person are you, Kira?

395
00:21:18,128 --> 00:21:18,919
Mmm.

396
00:22:36,842 --> 00:22:38,275
May 22nd.

397
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,911
My friend and I showed off our notebooks in Aoyama.

398
00:22:40,936 --> 00:22:45,875
If this fake Kira slips up and gets apprehended, at
the very least, I have to get my hands on his notebook.

399
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,851
I may end up having to kill everyone there.
