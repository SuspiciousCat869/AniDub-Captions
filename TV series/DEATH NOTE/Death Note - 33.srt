1
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,312
The second L and the person I
think is Kira can only be one man.

2
00:01:31,337 --> 00:01:32,507
Light Yagami.

3
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:34,926
This is Kiyomi Takada from News 6.

4
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:37,312
I have an announcement that comes directly from Kira.

5
00:01:37,337 --> 00:01:39,709
His words are to become the new law of the world.

6
00:01:39,886 --> 00:01:41,282
I just had an idea.

7
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:44,255
I think we can make use of Kiyomi Takada.

8
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:46,146
Please excuse me.

9
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:48,147
Kira!

10
00:01:48,172 --> 00:01:49,531
He's removing the bugs?

11
00:01:50,107 --> 00:01:51,573
We don't have a choice.

12
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:53,183
Listen, Kiyomi.

13
00:01:53,928 --> 00:01:55,569
I am the real Kira.

14
00:01:57,308 --> 00:01:59,808
Light is Kira?

15
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,860
All the pieces have fallen into place.

16
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:09,762
Now that things have come this far,

17
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,901
it's my turn to go to Japan.

18
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:14,988
Commander Rester.

19
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:15,988
Yes.

20
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:18,894
I'm afraid I need you to return to New York immediately.

21
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:19,927
Right now?

22
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,933
Yes. I'm intending to go to Japan.

23
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:22,775
All right.

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,474
So you would like me to stay
in New York while you're gone?

25
00:02:25,499 --> 00:02:26,649
Not at all.

26
00:02:26,717 --> 00:02:29,351
Then what's the point of me coming back there?

27
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:32,158
Truth is, I've never made travel arrangements

28
00:02:32,183 --> 00:02:34,280
or boarded a flight on my own before.

29
00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:36,086
That's why I need you to come back.

30
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:37,719
So you can escort me.

31
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,094
Understood.

32
00:02:48,328 --> 00:02:49,174
We got him.

33
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,527
Both Yoshida Productions and
NHN are practically begging us now.

34
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:55,565
The great Misa Misa comeback plan is a huge success.

35
00:02:55,697 --> 00:03:01,349
These days, it's nearly impossible for anyone
to get into NHN, but this will get us full access.

36
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,620
Yeah, that's right.

37
00:03:02,645 --> 00:03:05,173
Mogi will be gaining entry as Misa's manager.

38
00:03:05,198 --> 00:03:06,935
It'll definitely be to our advantage

39
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,753
to have someone who can go in and out freely.

40
00:03:08,778 --> 00:03:11,380
In the meantime, I'll continue investigating Takada.

41
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:15,925
This is Near. I want to speak to L.

42
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,686
This is L. What is you want from us?

43
00:03:19,173 --> 00:03:22,071
I'm following through with my goal to arrest Kira.

44
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:24,546
And that's why I'm Japan now.

45
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,140
He's in Japan?

46
00:03:26,283 --> 00:03:27,450
Why tell me?

47
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:29,001
He's up to something.

48
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,337
L. I presume you've already contacted Takada
for the purposes of your own investigation.

49
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:36,143
That's right.

50
00:03:36,168 --> 00:03:38,820
In fact, I'm investigating her myself at the moment.

51
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,026
I see.

52
00:03:40,373 --> 00:03:44,223
For the time being, it's a given that, if
we want to get any closer to capturing Kira,

53
00:03:44,248 --> 00:03:47,546
we'll have to keep an eye on
Kiyomi Takada and NHN in general.

54
00:03:48,973 --> 00:03:50,523
I want you to pass on a message.

55
00:03:50,548 --> 00:03:53,546
Inform her that, as of now, several SPK members

56
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:56,346
have entered Japan in order to catch and arrest Kira.

57
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:58,595
But why do that?

58
00:03:58,895 --> 00:04:01,047
To lure Kira out of hiding.

59
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:05,589
I also want you to mention the following
to her so she'll relay it to Kira.

60
00:04:05,614 --> 00:04:08,927
In total, there are only four active members of the SPK.

61
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:10,678
That includes myself.

62
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:13,670
Kira won't be able to resist such an opportunity.

63
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:15,012
Knowing him, he won't run.

64
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:17,644
Instead, he'll try to kill us before we get too close.

65
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:20,021
That's where I'll beat him at his own game.

66
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:22,002
Beat me at my own game, huh?

67
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:26,260
All right, Near.

68
00:04:26,428 --> 00:04:29,762
If that's how you want it, I'll accept your challenge.

69
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:32,199
I am in Japan as we speak.

70
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,333
I am in Japan as well.

71
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:36,717
Then we'll be quite close to each other.

72
00:04:36,742 --> 00:04:40,266
Who knows? We might even have
the chance to meet face to face.

73
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,811
I hope so.

74
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:45,207
Well, that'll be something to look forward to.

75
00:04:45,862 --> 00:04:46,612
Yes.

76
00:04:46,645 --> 00:04:50,072
When that time comes, we'll finish
this Kira matter once and for all.

77
00:04:50,142 --> 00:04:51,107
Definitely.

78
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:56,654
It's all becoming clear to me.

79
00:04:56,828 --> 00:05:01,134
From the very beginning, and even now,
it's been a one on one fight against L.

80
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:02,611
And even though he's dead,

81
00:05:03,073 --> 00:05:05,544
the battle's just shifted to his heirs.

82
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,012
Very well, Near. Fine.

83
00:05:08,037 --> 00:05:09,567
I'll come out to play if you will.

84
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:11,351
It's only fair, after all.

85
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:18,820
And when we meet, we'll find out which of us is
truly prepared to win, and whose wits will prevail.

86
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:22,423
When that happens, this long battle will end

87
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:25,628
and I can finally begin my reign at the top.

88
00:05:27,306 --> 00:05:30,128
First, let's review what we know so far.

89
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:35,120
L is Light Yagami, and he's also Kira.

90
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:37,855
For now, we'll call him L Kira.

91
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:39,461
There's also another one.

92
00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:42,286
Someone who has the notebook and is currently using it.

93
00:05:42,378 --> 00:05:44,449
We'll call him X Kira.

94
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:47,061
Judging by the pattern of X Kira's killings,

95
00:05:47,086 --> 00:05:50,673
he has definitely made the deal
and acquired the Shinigami eyes.

96
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:53,341
L Kira and X Kira can't communicate directly.

97
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:56,792
They must be planning to communicate
using Takada as a go between.

98
00:05:57,172 --> 00:06:00,472
So, given the situation as it now stands,

99
00:06:00,497 --> 00:06:03,071
there are two ways to win against Kira.

100
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,175
One, the simple way.

101
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:09,473
We arrange to kill both L Kira and X Kira

102
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,429
and confiscate the notebook.

103
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:13,610
However, no matter what might happen,

104
00:06:13,635 --> 00:06:15,226
we will never resort to that.

105
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,505
Why not?

106
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,695
That's not the way we work, Commander.

107
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,432
We, sir?

108
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,338
Yes, that's right.

109
00:06:22,506 --> 00:06:24,539
We kill those two and the murders stop.

110
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:27,983
Such ex post facto justification will not be tolerated.

111
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:30,689
That's not the way L and I do things,

112
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:33,089
because that would be an insult.

113
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:37,651
Don't forget, L entrusted this
case to those who came after him.

114
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:53,635
So, Kiyomi.

115
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:57,731
I heard on the news the other day that you
receive an enormous amount of fan mail every day.

116
00:06:58,211 --> 00:06:58,905
Yes.

117
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:02,277
I'm told on average it's about 200 letters a day.

118
00:07:02,845 --> 00:07:04,145
200 letters?

119
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:05,949
Wow, I'm a little jealous.

120
00:07:06,335 --> 00:07:10,459
Man, this is kind of boring listening
to audio only without any video feed.

121
00:07:10,803 --> 00:07:12,243
I think you should look through them,

122
00:07:12,318 --> 00:07:14,527
even if they are just letters from fans.

123
00:07:15,655 --> 00:07:16,446
You're right.

124
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:21,058
Keep calm as you read this note and the ones that follow.

125
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,954
Make sure not to let the people listening
to this conversation hear your reactions.

126
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:30,584
The SPK has started to make its move.

127
00:07:30,623 --> 00:07:32,726
You have to start thinking about your safety.

128
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:35,390
Instead of accepting messages from Kira,

129
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:39,875
maybe you should consider
making a few demands of your own.

130
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,154
Light's getting down to business.

131
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:44,491
You shouldn't only be a spokesperson.

132
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:46,388
Your voice should be heard as well.

133
00:07:46,895 --> 00:07:48,182
Reach out to Kira.

134
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:50,216
Tell him what you think he needs to know.

135
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:57,781
I have a different job for T.

136
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:01,246
In order to create the perfect
world that Kira has envisioned,

137
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:05,716
I want you to begin judging and punishing people as Kira.

138
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:10,328
It's all right, Kiyomi.

139
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:11,750
I have faith in you.

140
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:13,368
It's gonna be OK.

141
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:15,493
If you can do this,

142
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,094
I'm sure you'll be able to send Kira information

143
00:08:18,383 --> 00:08:21,104
that you don't want the SPK to know about.

144
00:08:25,183 --> 00:08:27,054
All right. I'll do it.

145
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:29,150
We nailed it.

146
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,495
That's our Light for you.

147
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:31,477
He's good.

148
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:36,527
Delete.

149
00:08:36,806 --> 00:08:37,864
Delete.

150
00:08:38,273 --> 00:08:39,148
Delete.

151
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,027
Kiyomi Takada.

152
00:08:44,972 --> 00:08:45,610
Hm.

153
00:08:46,728 --> 00:08:47,395
Yes?

154
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,806
I have an important message for you.

155
00:08:50,006 --> 00:08:51,513
You are to send me a fan letter that

156
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:53,529
I'll be able to recognize as yours.

157
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:56,261
You will also enclose something else in the envelope.

158
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:58,445
Five blank pages from the notebook.

159
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:04,166
Carry on with your judgements and killings as
usual until I receive the letter and the pages.

160
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:06,254
And how about after you receive them?

161
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:08,839
You have to stop using the real notebook.

162
00:09:08,984 --> 00:09:11,892
However, you must continue
entering names in a fake notebook.

163
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,251
A fake?

164
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:14,173
That's right.

165
00:09:14,784 --> 00:09:17,621
Make a notebook that looks as
close to the original as possible,

166
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:21,153
and act as if you're killing people by using this decoy.

167
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,012
I understand.

168
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,826
God. What are you planning?

169
00:09:28,995 --> 00:09:31,570
No. It's not my place to question God.

170
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,348
His will is absolute.

171
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:38,062
My job is to do what god wishes.

172
00:09:57,434 --> 00:09:59,449
Huh? What's this?

173
00:09:59,634 --> 00:10:01,749
It's a replacement for Kira's Kingdom.

174
00:10:01,774 --> 00:10:03,841
God, what's wrong with these people?

175
00:10:04,412 --> 00:10:05,559
Welcome to the show.

176
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:08,945
Today, Ms. Takada will introduce
her four new female bodyguards,

177
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,696
who were selected after a rigorous screening process.

178
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:15,104
The first is the winner of the
22nd World Karate Championships,

179
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:16,997
Miss Tatsumi Oyama.

180
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:20,879
The second is a former CIA agent, Ms. Halle Lidner.

181
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:26,356
If there is an SPK member among these
bodyguards, it would have to be Halle Lidner.

182
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:30,151
Looks like Near's conducting
his own investigation of Takada.

183
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:34,133
A phantom killer who stabbed six people in
Shinjuku's busy quarters was apprehended...

184
00:10:34,158 --> 00:10:36,422
Who I chose to be X Kira?

185
00:10:37,212 --> 00:10:39,701
Out of all the people in the world?

186
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:42,754
...educating our children about the existence of Kira

187
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,669
and the meaning of his teachings must be made mandatory.

188
00:10:45,694 --> 00:10:48,998
Above all, we must teach our children that Kira is good.

189
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:52,914
Takada was chosen because
she's a strong supporter of Kira.

190
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:59,988
So, that means X Kira must be someone
who knew they Takada was a Kira worshipper.

191
00:11:00,157 --> 00:11:03,134
Someone who had a close, intimate relationship with her

192
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,416
before her selection.

193
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:08,267
Also, Kira will not forgive
any crime, no matter how small.

194
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:09,732
From this point onwards,

195
00:11:09,757 --> 00:11:12,833
you should assume that any
person alive is a viable target.

196
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:27,611
I'd like to hear Kira's voice.

197
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:30,160
I want to hear his thoughts once again.

198
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:34,312
We should follow his teachings, exactly as Kira ordered.

199
00:11:34,337 --> 00:11:37,729
To me, it's obviously the
quickest path to lasting world peace.

200
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:39,573
Youth have a responsibility.

201
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:44,162
I think it is of the most importance that
young people do all they can to contribute.

202
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:46,459
It's our duty to improve our society.

203
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:50,439
If there are no words or orders from
Kira, then we have only one choice.

204
00:11:50,464 --> 00:11:52,440
We need to think for ourselves.

205
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:54,562
We need to consider what Kira has taught us,

206
00:11:54,587 --> 00:11:58,085
determine what he wants most, and
make our own decisions from there.

207
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,180
L Kira is Light Yagami.

208
00:12:00,712 --> 00:12:03,183
Could X Kira be Teru Mikami?

209
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:13,951
Everything seems to fit into place.

210
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:16,989
That's what I've been asking.

211
00:12:17,014 --> 00:12:19,527
So tell me why I'm not the headliner.

212
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:23,437
You said I was supposed to be the
highlight of the EastWest Pop Music Festival.

213
00:12:23,462 --> 00:12:25,503
Well, it's true that you're the highlight,

214
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:29,240
but when it comes to the headliner,
it's a little harder to secure that spot.

215
00:12:30,612 --> 00:12:31,133
Huh?

216
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:32,926
Huh?

217
00:12:33,434 --> 00:12:35,883
That's why we should be taking precautions.

218
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:41,328
Kiyomi Takada.

219
00:12:41,901 --> 00:12:43,072
What an idiot.

220
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:44,339
She doesn't even realize that

221
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,555
Light's just using her for his investigation.

222
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,780
Don't say that.

223
00:12:47,852 --> 00:12:49,405
You might end up dead if she hears you.

224
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,705
Duh, I know that.

225
00:12:50,798 --> 00:12:52,511
That's why I whispered it quietly.

226
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:54,868
Hey!

227
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:57,243
She snickered at me!

228
00:12:58,189 --> 00:12:59,667
I'm gonna go kick her!

229
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:01,147
Hang on!

230
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,106
What were you trying to do?

231
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:10,972
What was I doing? What about you?

232
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:11,731
Grr.

233
00:13:16,023 --> 00:13:20,274
Lidner, that young lady is
actually a very good friend of mine.

234
00:13:20,353 --> 00:13:22,518
Please, you shouldn't be so rough with her.

235
00:13:22,576 --> 00:13:23,221
Hmph!

236
00:13:23,755 --> 00:13:25,223
Of course, Miss Takada.

237
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:26,810
Please, excuse me.

238
00:13:29,056 --> 00:13:31,973
Misa Misa, are you all right?

239
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:36,180
That was so frustrating!

240
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:38,517
L, this is Near.

241
00:13:38,663 --> 00:13:40,350
I have a small request.

242
00:13:40,768 --> 00:13:45,140
If Mr. Aizawa is there, would it be
possible for me to speak to him for a moment?

243
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:47,573
Near, this is Aizawa. What is it?

244
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:51,194
I have a question regarding
surveillance for L and Takada's meetings.

245
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:54,611
Are you recording both audio and
video feed to their conversations?

246
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:57,528
Uh, no. Only an audio feed right now.

247
00:13:57,553 --> 00:14:00,420
I see. Only wiretaps at the moment.

248
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,886
How interesting. Thank you very much.

249
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,314
If they're only using wiretaps,

250
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:11,538
then it's safe to assume that L Kira and X Kira
have found a way to contact each other through Takada.

251
00:14:11,735 --> 00:14:14,665
Seems like Lidner could be in more danger than we realize.

252
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,500
We knew the risks getting into this.

253
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:18,734
To be blunt, what's important is that

254
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,546
L starts focusing his attention on Lidner and Takada.

255
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:25,128
In the meantime, we'll use the
opportunity to investigate Mikami further.

256
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,105
Hm.

257
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:28,018
How are things, Giovanni?

258
00:14:28,172 --> 00:14:29,389
Well, about Mikami.

259
00:14:29,655 --> 00:14:30,620
It's strange.

260
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:32,524
It's ridiculously easy to trail him.

261
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:34,195
He's not trying to hide, or anything.

262
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,653
He's lived at the same place the past four years.

263
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:38,678
There's nothing unusual about him.

264
00:14:38,768 --> 00:14:42,343
He also seems to be totally
dedicated to his career as a prosecutor.

265
00:14:42,368 --> 00:14:44,702
I'm beginning to think he can't be X Kira.

266
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,292
No. There is a very high
probability that Mikami is X Kira.

267
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:49,877
Please be very careful.

268
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,507
Don't enter his room yet.

269
00:14:51,532 --> 00:14:53,366
Just keep watch over him for now.

270
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:54,300
Gotcha.

271
00:14:56,535 --> 00:15:01,112
Man, how many meetings do I need to
have with NHN, for crying out loud?

272
00:15:01,137 --> 00:15:06,462
And seriously, how many times do these people
have to tell me, be careful about what you say?

273
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:07,573
What's with that?

274
00:15:07,598 --> 00:15:10,012
Yes. Yes, of course. I'll ask her right now.

275
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:12,887
Uh, listen. Misa Misa,

276
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:15,366
Takada would like to have dinner with you this evening.

277
00:15:15,391 --> 00:15:16,415
Just the two of you.

278
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,093
Huh?

279
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:19,621
That Kiyomi.

280
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:21,300
What's she up to?

281
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:23,424
Good idea.

282
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:25,814
The music festival's MC

283
00:15:25,988 --> 00:15:28,580
should have dinner with the main performer at least once.

284
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,396
Tell her OK.

285
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:31,252
Hm.

286
00:15:32,102 --> 00:15:32,712
Hello?

287
00:15:34,027 --> 00:15:34,887
Miss Takada?

288
00:15:35,191 --> 00:15:36,314
She's accepted.

289
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:38,940
Great. I'm looking forward to it.

290
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:40,601
Oh, and Lidner?

291
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:43,029
Please book a nice, private room for us.

292
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:46,013
And also, I'd like you to attend the dinner as well.

293
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:48,090
Huh? Yes.

294
00:16:09,522 --> 00:16:13,171
Misa, I'm sorry to have to invite
you to dinner so late at night.

295
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:16,996
I'm afraid it had to wait until
after the 9:00 news was finished

296
00:16:17,021 --> 00:16:19,040
No problem. I don't mind at all.

297
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:20,680
I'm a night owl, anyway.

298
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,255
Well, what is it?

299
00:16:32,622 --> 00:16:35,127
I'm not really sure how to answer a question like that.

300
00:16:35,512 --> 00:16:38,028
So, Light must be pretty busy.

301
00:16:38,168 --> 00:16:39,645
How do you two manage?

302
00:16:40,612 --> 00:16:43,812
Why, you! She knows that I can't see him that much,

303
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,980
while she can be with him all the time.

304
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,025
How dare she?

305
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,631
Things are great between us.

306
00:16:49,678 --> 00:16:52,386
Light is way more affectionate
than he looks. At least with me.

307
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:56,062
In fact, he starts clinging to me as
soon as he gets in the door every night.

308
00:16:56,456 --> 00:16:57,677
Ah. I see.

309
00:16:57,747 --> 00:16:59,526
It sounds like you're doing well.

310
00:16:59,712 --> 00:17:00,959
Thank goodness.

311
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:02,387
Yes.

312
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:05,966
Actually, I should probably
tell you, since you are the MC.

313
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:10,666
I'm going to announce my engagement
to Light at the Pop Music Festival.

314
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,794
Does he know about this?

315
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:19,734
Of course he does. It's an engagement.

316
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:22,050
It's not as if I can get engaged to myself.

317
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:23,993
He proposed to me more than a month ago.

318
00:17:24,018 --> 00:17:25,398
It was so romantic.

319
00:17:25,423 --> 00:17:29,985
Don't you think it'd be exciting to
announce it at the Pop Music Festival, Miss MC?

320
00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:39,710
Why not?

321
00:17:40,568 --> 00:17:42,054
If you're able to, that is.

322
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:43,880
What do you mean, if I'm able to?

323
00:17:43,987 --> 00:17:46,028
What, are you not going to let me announce it?

324
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,215
Or maybe it's something else.

325
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:50,960
Maybe you're going to get Kira to kill me.

326
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,470
Of course not.

327
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,689
Only Kira can decide who he's going to punish.

328
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,077
I have nothing to do with his decisions.

329
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:03,020
Besides, I've always thought
of you as a good friend, Misa.

330
00:18:03,045 --> 00:18:05,045
You shouldn't say such terrible things.

331
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:10,527
Anyway, I don't have any intention of killing
anyone, no matter how horrible they might be.

332
00:18:12,598 --> 00:18:13,751
Well, whatever.

333
00:18:14,323 --> 00:18:16,633
I used to really like Kira too, you know?

334
00:18:16,714 --> 00:18:19,390
But I know for sure that Light's going to catch him soon.

335
00:18:22,855 --> 00:18:24,222
Oh, yeah.

336
00:18:24,607 --> 00:18:27,615
Once he gets caught, it'll be
nothing but bad news for him.

337
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,266
And as for you, you'll probably be executed.

338
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:37,048
Miss Takada? Are you all right?

339
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:38,687
Huh?

340
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:46,852
Listen, Kiyomi.

341
00:18:47,635 --> 00:18:49,174
I am the real Kira.

342
00:18:49,624 --> 00:18:51,686
Please, join me, Kiyomi,

343
00:18:51,893 --> 00:18:54,603
and you will be the goddess of the new world.

344
00:18:59,623 --> 00:19:00,779
Miss Amane?

345
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:02,665
Yes?

346
00:19:03,068 --> 00:19:04,474
I find this unpleasant.

347
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:07,546
Hmph! Oh, yeah? I feel the same!

348
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:09,645
Obviously, this was a bad idea.

349
00:19:09,745 --> 00:19:13,712
I should've waited until you grew up and learned
a few minutes before I invited you to dinner.

350
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,485
I suppose I'll know better next time.

351
00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:16,311
Goodbye.

352
00:19:16,434 --> 00:19:17,474
Oh?

353
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:19,266
I'm older than you, Kiyomi.

354
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:23,472
And anyways, you're being childish
for storming out in the middle of diner

355
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,280
over a silly little comment!

356
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,148
Ha ha ha ha ha!

357
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:43,059
Hey, Motchi!

358
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,959
Thanks for waiting, Motchi!

359
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,415
How are you?

360
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:49,894
A...A... Are you OK?

361
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,447
Of course I am.

362
00:19:51,472 --> 00:19:53,305
I won, after all.

363
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,130
Won?

364
00:19:54,155 --> 00:19:56,452
Yeah. It was easy.

365
00:19:57,967 --> 00:20:00,734
About tonight's meeting between Takada and Amane.

366
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,731
They just talked about Light Yagami.

367
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:06,918
If you read between the lines, they
were arguing over which one was his lover.

368
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:08,642
Your thoughts?

369
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,450
All I can determine is this.

370
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:13,935
Light Yagami is popular with the ladies,

371
00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:17,568
and we know that Takada and Amane both adore him.

372
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:19,213
Near, please be serious about this.

373
00:20:19,238 --> 00:20:22,222
It is serious if they're both truly in love with him.

374
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,591
They will not easily betray him.

375
00:20:24,878 --> 00:20:27,736
In fact, they'll likely do whatever he asks.

376
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,726
Please stop.

377
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:42,804
Aw, come on now, lady.

378
00:20:42,829 --> 00:20:45,656
I mean, wearing a short skirt like that in the winter?

379
00:20:45,681 --> 00:20:47,029
It's an invitation.

380
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:48,572
Please. Someone!

381
00:20:51,026 --> 00:20:51,646
Hm?

382
00:20:53,797 --> 00:20:54,950
Cell phone?

383
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,290
Mikami's just taken out a notebook.

384
00:21:04,378 --> 00:21:05,440
Delete.

385
00:21:05,768 --> 00:21:07,051
He's writing something in it.

386
00:21:07,076 --> 00:21:08,635
Could that be it?

387
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,867
He's getting off the train.

388
00:22:37,094 --> 00:22:38,880
Mikami started talking to himself.

389
00:22:39,088 --> 00:22:41,521
He seems to have reacted to
the scrap of paper at his feet.

390
00:22:41,546 --> 00:22:42,798
He's gone into the gym.

391
00:22:42,966 --> 00:22:44,366
I've entered the locker room.

392
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,604
I'm opening the lock on his briefcase.

393
00:22:46,844 --> 00:22:48,831
I'm going to touch the notebook.
