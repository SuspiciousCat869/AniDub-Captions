1
00:02:04,645 --> 00:02:05,398
Huh?

2
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:09,947
Ah, OK, maybe the belt.

3
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:16,223
Huh? What now?

4
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:21,702
Well, looks like this system's
going to take some getting used to.

5
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:22,999
Fine.

6
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,053
How's this? Huh?

7
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:29,354
Good morning.

8
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:30,868
Eh?

9
00:02:32,638 --> 00:02:33,634
What's wrong?

10
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:35,042
Did you get hurt?

11
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,222
Oh, this? Kind of.

12
00:02:38,036 --> 00:02:40,357
I had a little fight with my wife, and...

13
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:44,559
it's just that my daughter's still young,
and I'm hardly ever at home as it is, so...

14
00:02:45,022 --> 00:02:46,485
Ah, yes.

15
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,634
It's probably best if you sleep at home.

16
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,602
Well, you're going to be missing out.

17
00:02:50,627 --> 00:02:52,737
The rooms in this place are amazing.

18
00:02:52,762 --> 00:02:55,240
If I were you, I'd just move the whole family in here.

19
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:56,565
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,627
That's easy for you to say as a bachelor.

21
00:02:59,153 --> 00:03:00,168
Where are they?

22
00:03:00,266 --> 00:03:01,314
Oh, they're on a date.

23
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:03,749
Last we checked, all of them were up in Misa-Misa's room.

24
00:03:04,377 --> 00:03:05,276
Hmm.

25
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:07,984
Surveillance cameras, huh?

26
00:03:08,082 --> 00:03:12,565
Well, since we know Misa has some connection
to the second Kira, I guess it does make sense.

27
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:17,139
But for god's sake, Matsuda, would
you stop with this Misa-Misa crap?

28
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:18,299
Uh, yeah, sure.

29
00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:22,695
Man, this has gotta be the lamest date I've ever been on.

30
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,599
No, no, no, please, just pretend I'm not even here, OK?

31
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:28,274
By the way, are you going to eat that piece of cake?

32
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:30,544
Cake makes you fat. I'm not gonna eat any.

33
00:03:30,847 --> 00:03:33,147
Actually, I find that you don't gain any weight

34
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,229
as long as you burn calories by using your brain.

35
00:03:35,254 --> 00:03:37,531
Hmph! So now you're calling me stupid?

36
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:41,709
Fine, then. I'll give you the piece of cake as
long as you agree to leave me and Light alone.

37
00:03:41,797 --> 00:03:43,384
Even if I leave you two alone,

38
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:45,665
I'm still going to be watching on surveillance cameras.

39
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,173
So it wouldn't make any difference.

40
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:47,999
You pervert!

41
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:50,364
Can't you stop it with your creepy hobby?

42
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:52,747
You can call me whatever you like. Last chance for cake.

43
00:03:53,481 --> 00:03:54,951
OK, then.

44
00:03:54,976 --> 00:03:57,131
I'll just close the curtains and turn off the lights.

45
00:03:57,156 --> 00:03:59,586
We have infrared cameras in here as well.

46
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:01,724
What's wrong with you?

47
00:04:01,749 --> 00:04:04,507
I thought moving here was supposed to help us catch Kira.

48
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:07,669
But since we've been here, you
don't seem all that motivated to me.

49
00:04:08,577 --> 00:04:10,097
Not motivated?

50
00:04:11,305 --> 00:04:12,087
You're right.

51
00:04:12,922 --> 00:04:14,344
Actually, I'm depressed.

52
00:04:14,851 --> 00:04:16,248
Depressed? What for?

53
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:17,288
Well...

54
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:23,264
truthfully, all this time, I thought that you
were Kira, and my entire case hinged on that fact.

55
00:04:23,883 --> 00:04:27,634
I guess I just can't get past the
fact that my deduction was wrong.

56
00:04:28,253 --> 00:04:31,515
Although having said that, I'm still suspicious of you.

57
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,590
That's why we're wearing these.

58
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,731
And we also know that Kira can control people's actions,

59
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:43,222
which means it's highly likely that Kira was
controlling your actions so that I would suspect you.

60
00:04:43,856 --> 00:04:47,331
If I assume both you and Misa
were being controlled by him,

61
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,709
then everything we've observed so
far makes a lot more sense to me.

62
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:58,040
If that's what you think, Misa and I were both Kira
during the time that we were being controlled, right?

63
00:04:58,534 --> 00:04:59,265
Yes.

64
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,382
I don't think I could have been wrong about that.

65
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:03,143
The two of you are Kira.

66
00:05:04,315 --> 00:05:05,232
Hmm.

67
00:05:06,934 --> 00:05:08,680
If what I'm thinking is correct,

68
00:05:08,705 --> 00:05:11,972
when your confinement began, you were Kira.

69
00:05:11,997 --> 00:05:15,975
I don't believe it's coincidence that as soon
as you were imprisoned, all the killings stopped.

70
00:05:16,424 --> 00:05:19,663
Until then, everything pointed to you being Kira.

71
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,473
But after two weeks, criminals actually began dying again.

72
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:29,342
Based on that evidence, I can only conclude that.

73
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,301
Kira's power passes between people.

74
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:35,445
That's an interesting idea.

75
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:38,930
But if it's true, it'll be nearly
impossible for us to catch Kira.

76
00:05:39,194 --> 00:05:41,685
Yes. That's why I'm overwhelmed.

77
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:44,688
Even if we catch someone under control,

78
00:05:44,713 --> 00:05:47,678
they'll likely lose their powers
and any memory of their crimes.

79
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:50,727
So in the end, pursuing them becomes futile.

80
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,093
But at this point, we have no
way of knowing if that's the case.

81
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:55,168
Cheer up, would you?

82
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:56,901
Cheer up?

83
00:05:57,092 --> 00:05:58,725
No, I'm sorry, I can't.

84
00:05:58,801 --> 00:06:02,157
It's probably better if I just stop trying so hard.

85
00:06:03,024 --> 00:06:07,449
By chasing Kira so desperately, we're
just putting our lives at risk or nothing.

86
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,104
Yes, it's just a waste of time.

87
00:06:12,557 --> 00:06:13,536
Ryuzaki.

88
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,731
Huh?

89
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:25,767
Eh?

90
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:27,050
Eww...

91
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:31,161
You know, that really hurt.

92
00:06:31,353 --> 00:06:32,386
That's enough.

93
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,386
You don't feel like doing anything,

94
00:06:34,411 --> 00:06:37,791
just because your genius deduction
was wrong, and I'm not Kira?

95
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:41,382
Fine. Perhaps I phrased that the wrong way.

96
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:45,178
I meant it would be pointless for us to
make a move, so we shouldn't even bother.

97
00:06:45,203 --> 00:06:47,207
If we don't chase Kira, he'll never be caught.

98
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:48,240
Is that what you want?

99
00:06:48,323 --> 00:06:51,816
If you were just going to give up, then
why did you involve all those innocent people?

100
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:55,682
More importantly, what was the point
of putting Misa and me behind bars?

101
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:57,615
I understand.

102
00:06:58,405 --> 00:07:01,272
But still, whatever the reason...

103
00:07:04,947 --> 00:07:07,174
an eye for an eye, my friend.

104
00:07:21,205 --> 00:07:23,309
It's not my deduction that was wrong.

105
00:07:23,596 --> 00:07:26,962
The fact is, I can say that Light Yagami is Kira

106
00:07:27,024 --> 00:07:29,220
and Misa Amane is the second Kira,

107
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:31,971
but it won't be enough to solve the case.

108
00:07:31,996 --> 00:07:34,030
And that's why I'm a little depressed.

109
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:35,855
Is that so unreasonable?

110
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,814
Yes. Yes, it is. Besides, you should hear yourself.

111
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,745
It's as if you won't be satisfied unless I am Kira.

112
00:07:42,191 --> 00:07:45,375
I... I won't be satisfied unless you're Kira.

113
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:48,316
Well, there may be some truth to that.

114
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:52,392
In fact, now that you mention it, you're right.

115
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,834
I think I wanted you to be Kira.

116
00:07:59,303 --> 00:08:01,534
As I said before, an eye for an eye.

117
00:08:02,572 --> 00:08:05,251
I'm a lot stronger than I look, you know.

118
00:08:07,938 --> 00:08:10,098
We've got to call the room and stop them.

119
00:08:12,014 --> 00:08:12,660
Huh?

120
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:15,435
Yes? Ryuzaki, I've got good news.

121
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,592
Misa-Misa's number one in "Eighteen"
magazine's reader popularity poll.

122
00:08:19,952 --> 00:08:21,219
Oh, I see.

123
00:08:21,524 --> 00:08:25,423
And get this, she's going to get a
lead role in Ishinaka's next movie.

124
00:08:26,543 --> 00:08:27,806
What was that?

125
00:08:27,972 --> 00:08:30,172
Matsuda's acting stupid again.

126
00:08:30,197 --> 00:08:30,874
Hmm.

127
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:32,908
Well, that is his specialty.

128
00:08:34,005 --> 00:08:35,950
I can hear you, you know.

129
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,434
Ryuzaki, I know you're not feeling up to it,

130
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:48,807
but come over here for a second.

131
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:51,035
Take a close look at this.

132
00:08:51,518 --> 00:08:52,933
It can't be coincidence.

133
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:53,590
Huh?

134
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,439
All of the more prominent Japanese businessmen,

135
00:08:56,464 --> 00:08:59,902
CEOs whose companies are leaders
in their respective industries,

136
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:02,849
in just over a month, they all died of heart attacks.

137
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:07,457
As expected, there's been a general downturn
in the market, with the exception of Yotsuba.

138
00:09:07,653 --> 00:09:11,786
In other words, their deaths
have worked in Yotsuba's favor.

139
00:09:12,062 --> 00:09:16,001
Looking back, there have been 13
similar deaths in the past three months.

140
00:09:16,742 --> 00:09:17,711
Your thoughts?

141
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,511
Based on this, I can only conclude
that Kira is supporting Yotsuba.

142
00:09:21,752 --> 00:09:23,199
Hmm, could be.

143
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:28,395
But if what you're saying is true, we can assume
that punishing criminals is not this Kira's real intent.

144
00:09:28,811 --> 00:09:29,620
Right.

145
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:32,144
Punishing criminals is a diversion for him.

146
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:36,486
It obscures the fact that he's actually
killing people for the benefit of his company.

147
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:37,706
Hmm.

148
00:09:37,986 --> 00:09:40,865
Are you feeling a bit more motivated now?

149
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:52,612
It's funny.

150
00:09:52,737 --> 00:09:54,816
This is starting to feel too easy.

151
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:57,638
Look at all we've done, and no one suspects a thing.

152
00:09:57,773 --> 00:10:01,001
Our stock continues to increase,
but we've kept it below the radar.

153
00:10:01,328 --> 00:10:05,324
Indeed, everything appears to
be proceeding according to plan.

154
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:07,470
That's true.

155
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:10,114
However, there is one thing that has me concerned.

156
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:12,729
Those three we had killed last week,

157
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:15,341
why did all of them die of heart attacks?

158
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:17,776
I thought we agreed one would be accidental.

159
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:19,997
You're quite right. We did.

160
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:23,323
The problem was that we named
a specific location in Japan.

161
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,885
You see, he wasn't even here when he died.

162
00:10:25,953 --> 00:10:28,597
I hear he and his mistress were in Italy at the time.

163
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:29,827
Makes sense.

164
00:10:29,852 --> 00:10:32,858
If our request is physically impossible, then...

165
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:36,895
Kira will kill that person using
his default method, a heart attack.

166
00:10:36,998 --> 00:10:39,056
It's just like I was saying last week,

167
00:10:39,081 --> 00:10:42,786
if you want it to look believable,
request accidental death or disease,

168
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:45,561
and Kira will always find the
quickest way to make it happen.

169
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:51,488
Anyway, given Kira's history, the police are
probably still focused on the dying criminals.

170
00:10:51,747 --> 00:10:56,372
Quite frankly, if someone was able to
trace the deaths of these people back to us,

171
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:58,259
then he'd have to be a god.

172
00:10:58,494 --> 00:11:00,988
Besides, we've taken precautions.

173
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:04,680
Uh... hey, chief.

174
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,248
Oh, you too, Mogi. I've got some great news.

175
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,404
This is amazing.

176
00:11:08,462 --> 00:11:10,365
I'm not even sure how we figured it out,

177
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,582
but Light has a theory that Kira is
somehow involved with the Yotsuba Group.

178
00:11:13,613 --> 00:11:14,848
Can you believe it?

179
00:11:14,955 --> 00:11:16,035
Yotsuba?

180
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:17,927
Uh, yes.

181
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:20,768
That's probably it. Good work.

182
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:21,429
Huh?

183
00:11:22,287 --> 00:11:27,177
We just spoke with the director, and it seems
Kira has offered bribes to a number of politicians.

184
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,954
Kira made an offer.

185
00:11:31,102 --> 00:11:36,748
As long as the NPA agrees not to pursue him
anymore, he won't lay a hand on any politicians.

186
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:39,706
So that's that.

187
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:41,100
The police caved in to him.

188
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:42,055
Huh?

189
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:42,862
Huh?

190
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,610
Mogi and I have already made up our minds on this.

191
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:50,954
Aizawa, Matsuda, if you wish
to continue working this case,

192
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:53,950
you'll have to hand in your
letter of resignation to the NPA,

193
00:11:53,975 --> 00:11:55,940
just as Mogi and I are going to do.

194
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,130
Like it or not, you cannot pursue Kira
as a member of the police force any more.

195
00:12:01,402 --> 00:12:03,533
Hold... Hold on a second, Chief.

196
00:12:03,637 --> 00:12:05,187
They made it quite clear.

197
00:12:05,431 --> 00:12:08,017
If you continue to work with L, you'll be fired.

198
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,987
That's all there is to it.

199
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:12,018
So then, Chief, you're gonna...

200
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:15,835
In a few hours, I'm no longer going to be your chief.

201
00:12:16,244 --> 00:12:19,477
However, we all have our own lives.

202
00:12:19,502 --> 00:12:21,407
So think it over carefully.

203
00:12:21,745 --> 00:12:25,518
That's true, Chief, especially
if you've got a family to support.

204
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:31,607
If you want my opinion, you'd
be better off as police officers.

205
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,408
I was alone when I started this case.

206
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,127
And although I'm grateful to all of you
for staying with me as long as you have,

207
00:12:39,798 --> 00:12:42,049
I know that I can do this by myself.

208
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,718
I'll be sure to visit you at the department and bring you.

209
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:47,952
Kira's head as a reward for all that you've sacrificed.

210
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,342
Ryuzaki, as long as I'm alive, you won't be working alone.

211
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:54,432
You have my word on that.

212
00:12:55,294 --> 00:12:56,528
Hmm, that's right.

213
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,293
I'll have Light working with me until I catch Kira,

214
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:00,995
so I won't be alone after all.

215
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:05,222
But as I said, I think the rest of
you should remain as police officers.

216
00:13:05,335 --> 00:13:07,031
But when you first contacted us,

217
00:13:07,056 --> 00:13:10,219
you said that you would need the help
of the police in order to solve this case.

218
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:14,847
That's because the police as an
organization were still hoping to arrest Kira.

219
00:13:14,872 --> 00:13:16,137
They weren't bowing to him.

220
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,655
Besides, with all due respect,

221
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,891
there's a big difference between the help of two
or three civilians and the police as an organization.

222
00:13:22,945 --> 00:13:25,358
As you said, the police have made their position clear.

223
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:27,977
They don't want to catch Kira,
so let's just leave it at that.

224
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:31,793
Well, I suppose what you're saying makes sense.

225
00:13:31,818 --> 00:13:35,251
If we're not police officers
anymore, we won't be of much use to you.

226
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:38,299
However, we're all personally involved in this.

227
00:13:38,573 --> 00:13:40,927
All of us have risked our lives to catch Kira.

228
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,806
Doesn't that give us the right to decide

229
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:46,720
whether we stay here or return to the police force?

230
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:48,260
Ah, good point.

231
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:51,210
Then by all means, please, make your decision.

232
00:13:52,202 --> 00:13:53,435
But Chief, wait.

233
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,827
If you quit your job with the
police force, you'll be unemployed.

234
00:13:56,974 --> 00:14:01,223
Even if we do catch Kira, what
are you going to do after that?

235
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:05,133
After that, I hadn't really thought of it.

236
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:07,690
But I suppose after we catch Kira,

237
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:11,940
I'll have to dust off my resume.

238
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,046
Count me in!

239
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:16,547
I'm going to quit the police and chase Kira too, Chief!

240
00:14:16,962 --> 00:14:19,700
And I still have my job as Misa-Misa's manager.

241
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,715
Besides, if I stayed on as a police officer,

242
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,021
I'd feel like a total loser.

243
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:25,263
Think before you open your mouth, Matsuda.

244
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:27,045
Uh...

245
00:14:34,422 --> 00:14:38,722
Is there any way I could still keep
my job and help you in my spare time?

246
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,738
There isn't.

247
00:14:40,022 --> 00:14:43,129
If you remain a police officer,
then please don't come back here.

248
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:46,111
But you know I won't leak any information.

249
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,443
I won't be sharing any of our information.

250
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:53,510
You're free to pursue Kira on your own, if you want to.

251
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:55,983
But I don't think it's fair to your families

252
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:59,596
to burden them by giving up your
livelihood just to continue this.

253
00:14:59,621 --> 00:15:01,642
I can't see how that's a good idea.

254
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,859
It's as Ryuzaki says.

255
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:07,414
No one here is going to blame you for quitting.

256
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,695
Yeah, right.

257
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,918
We all understand why you've got to do this.

258
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,144
But the chief has a family too.

259
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:17,316
NO. Our situations are completely different.

260
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,011
Damn it.

261
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,598
To leave now, after all we've been through

262
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:27,260
I said I was prepared to die if that's
what it took to catch him, and I meant it.

263
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,478
What kind of friend would I be to Ukita if I quit now?

264
00:15:31,645 --> 00:15:34,440
I became a detective so I could catch the bad guys,

265
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:35,862
NOT RUN AWAY!

266
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,230
Ryuzaki, early on in the investigation,

267
00:15:40,344 --> 00:15:45,417
you specifically told me that if a task force
member were to lose their job under any circumstances,

268
00:15:45,507 --> 00:15:49,667
I should make preparations to ensure that
their family's financial future was secure.

269
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:53,212
If you recall, a trust was
set aside for that very purpose.

270
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:55,173
I'm a little curious

271
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:57,318
as to why you're withholding this information.

272
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:00,085
This is not the time or place, Watari.

273
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:01,836
I am sorry.

274
00:16:02,036 --> 00:16:02,891
No way!

275
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,997
So all this time, we had nothing to worry about?

276
00:16:05,022 --> 00:16:06,515
I can't believe you did that.

277
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,613
There you go, Aizawa. Isn't that great news?

278
00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:09,317
Huh?

279
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:17,322
Ryuzaki, I assume that was some kind of test

280
00:16:17,347 --> 00:16:19,606
to determine how committed I was to this task force.

281
00:16:19,631 --> 00:16:21,600
It it's not like that, Aizawa.

282
00:16:21,828 --> 00:16:24,227
Ryuzaki's just not the type to say things directly.

283
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:25,633
You should know that by now.

284
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:27,137
Yeah, that's right.

285
00:16:27,162 --> 00:16:27,708
No.

286
00:16:27,795 --> 00:16:28,703
Huh?

287
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,338
I was testing you.

288
00:16:31,515 --> 00:16:33,745
I wanted to see which one you would choose.

289
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:36,002
Ryuzaki.

290
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:41,610
Fine, then.

291
00:16:41,944 --> 00:16:44,108
If I wasn't sure before, I am now.

292
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,465
But Aizawa...

293
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,057
Let's face it.

294
00:16:47,082 --> 00:16:49,597
I wasn't able to decide right away like you guys.

295
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:52,548
I was leaning towards going back to the police.

296
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:54,524
Come on, Aizawa. Don't be so stubborn.

297
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:55,862
No, I quit.

298
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:58,480
Now I know this for sure.

299
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,576
I've always hated Ryuzaki.

300
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:03,176
I hate him and his way of doing things!

301
00:17:04,953 --> 00:17:07,621
That's too bad, because I like you, Aizawa.

302
00:17:12,101 --> 00:17:14,626
I also hate the way you've
always gotta have the last word!

303
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:16,768
You insult me, now you say something like that?

304
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:18,700
That's it. I'm outta here.

305
00:17:18,908 --> 00:17:20,395
Thank you for everything.

306
00:17:32,882 --> 00:17:37,901
I just found another one, a general manager
of a bank, Yotsuba's biggest competitor.

307
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:42,829
On September 7, he slipped and fell on the
front steps of his house and died instantly.

308
00:17:43,113 --> 00:17:45,659
September the 7th was a Friday, wasn't it?

309
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:46,700
Hmm?

310
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:48,991
After going over this again, I noticed something.

311
00:17:49,016 --> 00:17:51,271
All the deaths which are beneficial to Yotsuba

312
00:17:51,296 --> 00:17:53,282
are concentrated around the weekends.

313
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:55,280
Huh? On the weekends?

314
00:17:55,396 --> 00:17:58,826
With the first few victims, the time
of death appears to have been random.

315
00:17:58,851 --> 00:18:03,112
More recently, they all take place
between Friday night and Saturday afternoon.

316
00:18:03,424 --> 00:18:05,591
I'm amazed that you even noticed that, Chief.

317
00:18:05,624 --> 00:18:08,432
Matsuda, I thought I told you to stop calling me chief.

318
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:11,265
I'm sorry, but you'll always be the chief to me.

319
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:14,445
This is a really important clue, Dad. Nice work.

320
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,927
Well, you know, I can't let
myself fall behind you and Ryuzaki.

321
00:18:18,302 --> 00:18:20,915
After all, the last thing I want is to be dead weight.

322
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,429
Ah?

323
00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:22,804
Dead weight?

324
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:25,258
Is Kira someone from Yotsuba?

325
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,783
Or is Kira simply using Yotsuba?

326
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:29,068
I haven't figured that out yet,

327
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:32,623
but we'll proceed under the
assumption that this is Kira's doing.

328
00:18:33,386 --> 00:18:35,360
We will focus on Yotsuba.

329
00:18:36,768 --> 00:18:39,479
This is all of the Yotsuba Group's employees.

330
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,452
Here.

331
00:18:40,782 --> 00:18:42,108
Thank you very much.

332
00:18:42,281 --> 00:18:44,308
That's 300,000 people.

333
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:46,456
How did you put this together so quickly?

334
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:47,903
That's amazing, Mogi.

335
00:18:48,437 --> 00:18:50,695
He's been incredibly efficient from the start.

336
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:55,541
Ryuzaki, please tell me, is there anything
I can do to help with the investigation,

337
00:18:55,572 --> 00:18:57,135
besides the manager thing?

338
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,590
So you really want to be useful?

339
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:00,845
Yes.

340
00:19:01,395 --> 00:19:03,428
Then could you get me another cup of coffee?

341
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:04,582
Uh.

342
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,050
And for our guests over there as well.

343
00:19:07,186 --> 00:19:08,828
Uh?

344
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:10,815
Who are they?

345
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,875
Hold on a sec. Who let them in?

346
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:16,478
Those two are the newest members of the task force.

347
00:19:19,752 --> 00:19:20,797
The name's Aiber.

348
00:19:21,087 --> 00:19:23,059
I'm a con man. How's it going?

349
00:19:23,323 --> 00:19:24,345
I'm Wedy.

350
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:26,260
And I'm a thief by trade.

351
00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:29,472
Oh, a con man and a thief.

352
00:19:29,497 --> 00:19:30,397
That's right.

353
00:19:30,744 --> 00:19:32,944
Aiber is a lifelong con man.

354
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:38,161
His unparalleled social skills allow him
to befriend and gain the trust of any target.

355
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:40,096
We'll use him for infiltration.

356
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:44,631
As for Wedy, she's a thief who specializes
in cracking high-end security systems.

357
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:49,120
As proof of how that, she was able to enter
the building without setting off a single alarm.

358
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:52,725
You expect us to work with criminals?

359
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,967
Yes, that is correct.

360
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,892
However, these two have never once been caught,

361
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:58,417
so it's unlikely they'll be killed by Kira.

362
00:19:58,442 --> 00:20:01,125
Think of them as professionals of the underworld.

363
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,721
I understand.

364
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:06,377
To investigate Yotsuba, we're going
to need the help of people like this.

365
00:20:07,224 --> 00:20:09,841
Let's all do our part and make this happen, OK?

366
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:10,753
Yeah.

367
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:12,094
Uh, yeah.

368
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:26,697
Huh?

369
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:27,564
Daddy?

370
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,307
Huh?

371
00:20:28,838 --> 00:20:29,779
Daddy!

372
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:31,996
Yumi.

373
00:20:32,295 --> 00:20:33,160
Eriko.

374
00:20:33,657 --> 00:20:36,304
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at work right now?

375
00:20:36,442 --> 00:20:39,109
You need to tell me if you're
planning to be home for dinner.

376
00:20:39,134 --> 00:20:41,793
I just went shopping, and I only bought for me and Yumi.

377
00:20:41,818 --> 00:20:44,748
You can eat my dinner, and I'll have dessert instead.

378
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:45,703
Sorry.

379
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:49,262
It was sort of a last minute decision,
but they just gave me some time off.

380
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:49,990
Huh?

381
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,276
Is a time off a vacation, Daddy?

382
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:53,881
Yeah, that's right.

383
00:20:53,906 --> 00:20:55,606
Yippee!

384
00:20:55,644 --> 00:20:58,706
From now on, I can have a break every single week.

385
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:02,170
Now I can go with you to the park.

386
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:08,474
Maybe we can go to the zoo together or the amusement park.

387
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:13,530
Oh? What's wrong, Dad?

388
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:18,381
Mommy, why is Daddy crying?

389
00:22:38,307 --> 00:22:39,773
Confidential meetings?

390
00:22:40,153 --> 00:22:43,325
And from the sound of it, they
have one every Friday night.

391
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,806
This is it!

392
00:22:46,797 --> 00:22:48,263
I'm on a roll today.
