1
00:01:30,598 --> 00:01:31,098
Hey.

2
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:33,968
I thought we were supposed to be meeting every other week.

3
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,032
Not this often.

4
00:01:35,057 --> 00:01:36,146
It can't be helped.

5
00:01:36,337 --> 00:01:38,337
We just received a new report from Coil.

6
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:41,234
He says that Misa Amane might know L.

7
00:01:42,029 --> 00:01:47,027
According to Coil, L once questioned
Amane as part of his Kira investigation.

8
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:48,841
But see, here's the problem.

9
00:01:49,324 --> 00:01:53,014
He says, I've been able to
deduce that Amane worships Kira.

10
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:58,782
At the moment, Yoshida Productions is trying
to promote Amane as the new face of Yotsuba.

11
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:03,263
My recommendation is that Yotsuba
use her for the next ad campaign

12
00:02:03,288 --> 00:02:06,272
and take the opportunity to extract information about L.

13
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:08,548
Personally, I don't like the idea.

14
00:02:08,624 --> 00:02:10,658
It's unacceptable, if you ask me.

15
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:11,764
Oh really?

16
00:02:12,078 --> 00:02:13,944
It seems like a perfectly good plan.

17
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:16,315
I don't think that's what Ooi was trying to say.

18
00:02:16,677 --> 00:02:20,077
It's supposed to be Coil's
job to investigate L's identity.

19
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:23,815
It doesn't make sense for him to leave
all the hard work to us, in my opinion.

20
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:25,496
Exactly.

21
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:28,391
We're paying him to uncover L's identity, after all.

22
00:02:28,668 --> 00:02:31,959
Why don't we contact Coil and see what he has to say?

23
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:34,276
Yes. That's a good idea.

24
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,005
Mr. Kida.

25
00:02:37,092 --> 00:02:40,482
I thought we agreed before that
you'd only call me if it was urgent.

26
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:42,172
So, is it an emergency?

27
00:02:44,314 --> 00:02:45,853
Yes, I understand.

28
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:48,913
In that case, I think I have an even better idea.

29
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:55,170
Even after those meetings are over, I
have to come home to punish criminals.

30
00:02:55,477 --> 00:02:57,785
Being Kira is so time consuming.

31
00:02:58,368 --> 00:03:01,090
But things sure have become more interesting lately.

32
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,739
It's pretty clear that Misa Amane was the second Kira,

33
00:03:04,857 --> 00:03:07,420
and that L must've caught her at some point.

34
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:12,579
The only way she could've gotten out of that
situation is by forfeiting ownership of her Death Note

35
00:03:12,631 --> 00:03:14,831
and losing all memories of what she did with it.

36
00:03:15,944 --> 00:03:18,517
I'm not about to leave things as they are.

37
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:22,320
I'm going to make Misa Amane my wife.

38
00:03:22,554 --> 00:03:23,358
Huh?

39
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:30,585
Everything I could ever want.

40
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:33,712
Money, power, and a beautiful wife.

41
00:03:33,901 --> 00:03:36,340
That'll be enough to make anyone envious.

42
00:03:37,863 --> 00:03:42,790
Once we're married, I'll just invest
a large lump sum in her life insurance.

43
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:46,704
She would never marry such a disgusting fool.

44
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:48,248
Rem.

45
00:03:48,405 --> 00:03:51,567
Make sure you hide the notebook in the usual place.

46
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:04,714
Right now, this is the only
thing I can do, for Misa's sake.

47
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,797
All right. Let's try again, from the top.

48
00:04:11,883 --> 00:04:12,963
Tell me, Misa.

49
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:16,156
Is it true you once said that you
came to Tokyo in order to meet Kira?

50
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:17,459
What?

51
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:18,947
Misa.

52
00:04:19,186 --> 00:04:20,219
Please stop overacting.

53
00:04:20,244 --> 00:04:22,428
It looks too cheesy, not to mention fake.

54
00:04:22,453 --> 00:04:23,185
Huh?

55
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,561
But I thought that was a realistic performance.

56
00:04:25,586 --> 00:04:26,725
Just do it again.

57
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:29,633
Whatever you say, oh so great director.

58
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:31,858
If you don't get serious about this, I'll kick you.

59
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:32,466
Hmph.

60
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,036
Uh, Misa Misa?

61
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:40,028
You're not smiling enough, Motchi!

62
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:41,772
And you can just call me Misa, you know.

63
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:45,771
I'm not cut out for this, but it's part of my job, so...

64
00:04:47,972 --> 00:04:49,030
Misa-Misa!

65
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,693
What is it, Motchi?

66
00:04:50,718 --> 00:04:54,698
Today you have an interview with the Yotsuba Group
to see if they'll use you in their new ad campaign.

67
00:04:54,723 --> 00:04:57,987
But remember, this is also an
infiltration mission, so stay sharp!

68
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:00,799
Don't you worry. I already know about that.

69
00:05:00,824 --> 00:05:03,983
And of course, that means you
can't let your cover fall either.

70
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:07,661
You're gonna play the character
of the hyperenergetic manager, OK?

71
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:10,097
Right! Bring it on! Hooah!

72
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:13,477
Sorry to keep you waiting.

73
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:14,931
Good morning!

74
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:18,961
I'm Misa Misa's manager, Kanichi
Moji, also known as Motchi!

75
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,753
Mr. Ooi, Mr. Shimura.

76
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,353
It's so nice to see you again.

77
00:05:22,378 --> 00:05:24,339
Good luck, Misa Misa!

78
00:05:24,364 --> 00:05:26,212
Way to go, Motchi. You're a natural.

79
00:05:26,237 --> 00:05:29,280
I'll be here ready to celebrate
when they decide to hire you!

80
00:05:32,537 --> 00:05:34,532
I don't think I'm cut out for this.

81
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:39,260
Now then.

82
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:42,094
I don't believe you and I have met before, have we Miso?

83
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:44,082
My name is John Wallace.

84
00:05:44,107 --> 00:05:46,579
I'm the executive adviser for the advertising department.

85
00:05:46,895 --> 00:05:47,912
Nice to meet you.

86
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,554
Thank you! I'm very pleased to meet you too!

87
00:05:50,814 --> 00:05:54,368
Well, this might seem a little bit
sudden, but I'd like to be honest with you.

88
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,681
We've been talking about it, and we've
pretty much decided to hire you already.

89
00:05:58,813 --> 00:06:02,302
But before we make it official,
we'd like to clarify a few things.

90
00:06:02,423 --> 00:06:03,237
Yes?

91
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,480
We've been doing a little background check on you,

92
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:09,897
and according to our sources, a burglar
killed your parents during a robbery.

93
00:06:09,922 --> 00:06:12,263
You worship Kira because he killed the suspect.

94
00:06:12,485 --> 00:06:16,261
Isn't it true that you came to Tokyo
in hopes of finding and meeting Kira?

95
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:18,490
Uh, what?

96
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,145
Who did you hear that from?

97
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,503
I'm afraid I can't answer that.

98
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:25,906
The information is reliable,
and now I'd say it's confirmed.

99
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:29,021
The look in your face tells me that these are the facts.

100
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:31,749
Coil.

101
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,544
I never thought you investigated that far.

102
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,499
Also...

103
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,416
You're still hiding something from us, aren't you?

104
00:06:38,994 --> 00:06:41,460
Something you'd prefer the world not to know.

105
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:49,559
OK. Here's where I pause and look nervous.

106
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,322
It seems you were detained by the
detective L for a short period of time.

107
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:57,537
We'd like you to tell us the
full story of what really happened.

108
00:06:57,923 --> 00:07:01,427
It would be a problem if the new
face of Yotsuba turned out to be Kira.

109
00:07:01,857 --> 00:07:02,682
Yes.

110
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:05,239
We would appreciate it if you were honest with us.

111
00:07:05,706 --> 00:07:07,642
All right. I understand.

112
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:09,540
I'll tell you everything.

113
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:13,713
Yes. I was held for questioning.

114
00:07:13,738 --> 00:07:17,872
I didn't think it was L, but he did
ask me lots of questions about Kira.

115
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:22,453
But I'm not the second Kira, and I never was.

116
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:26,630
I was released because he realised I
didn't have anything to do with Kira after all.

117
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,238
Did you manage to see who it was that was restraining you?

118
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:32,533
No. I was blindfolded the whole time.

119
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:35,817
But if he asked you questions,
surely you heard his voice, right?

120
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:38,527
Only through a speaker and voice filter, so.

121
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:39,664
Come on.

122
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:41,669
What the hell is this anyway?

123
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,903
A job interview or a police interrogation?

124
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,596
How long are we gonna keep this up?

125
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,445
I'm going to the bathroom.

126
00:07:47,606 --> 00:07:48,536
He has a point.

127
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:50,782
It seems the interview veered a little off track.

128
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:51,896
We're very sorry.

129
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:57,408
Excuse me, but would you mind
if I went to the bathroom as well?

130
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:01,795
This is getting exhausting.

131
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,920
But everything's going well so far.

132
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:05,430
I just have to keep it up.

133
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:18,820
Being touched by this scrap of paper alone
will not restore her memories of the Death Note,

134
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:21,791
but at least now Misa can see me once again.

135
00:08:23,344 --> 00:08:26,408
What is this thing? Some kind of monster?

136
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:27,632
Misa.

137
00:08:27,703 --> 00:08:30,226
You're in a dangerous situation right now.

138
00:08:30,382 --> 00:08:33,989
There are people within Yotsuba
who can easily have you killed.

139
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,845
I've come here to warn you.

140
00:08:36,197 --> 00:08:38,114
Calm down and listen to me.

141
00:08:38,303 --> 00:08:40,277
Calm down? How can I?

142
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:42,466
This thing looks like it's gonna kill me.

143
00:08:43,728 --> 00:08:46,086
Please believe me. I'm your ally.

144
00:08:46,147 --> 00:08:47,993
My ally?

145
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:52,180
Oh, man, I wonder if Misa Misa's all right.

146
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:54,885
Maybe we should've wired her or
used something to track her movements.

147
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:56,895
Just as I thought.

148
00:08:57,347 --> 00:09:01,141
The Kira before I was detained
and the one that surfaced afterwards.

149
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,719
They must be two different people.

150
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:04,652
The MO clearly doesn't match.

151
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:09,093
This Kira is killing criminals as soon
as they've had their crime broadcast on TV,

152
00:09:09,118 --> 00:09:10,802
regardless of the situation.

153
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,936
He's punishing people who never intended to kill.

154
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:16,432
Those who sincerely regretted their crimes

155
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,857
or people with excusable circumstances.

156
00:09:19,116 --> 00:09:22,693
To original Kira would've never
punished those kinds of people.

157
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:26,848
That's the sort of distinction I'd make if I were him.

158
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:30,634
The way the original Kira acted...

159
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:33,789
is disturbingly close to my ideals.

160
00:09:36,305 --> 00:09:38,061
What the hell am I thinking?

161
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,321
I'm not Kira.

162
00:09:40,387 --> 00:09:41,820
Something's got to be wrong with me

163
00:09:41,853 --> 00:09:44,618
if I'm seriously comparing myself to that murder.

164
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,235
Light Yagami is Kira.

165
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,500
Tell me.

166
00:09:49,572 --> 00:09:51,579
What is Light doing at the moment?

167
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,164
Wha... What are you?

168
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,070
I mean, I can tell you're not a stalker, but...

169
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,038
you don't look like a human at all.

170
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:08,834
No, of course not.

171
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,797
I am a Shinigami.

172
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:16,018
Before you were captured by L,
you and I worked closely together.

173
00:10:16,097 --> 00:10:17,587
What are you talking about?

174
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,945
I don't understand.

175
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:21,745
You know me and Light is Kira?

176
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:24,401
The Death Note.

177
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:30,276
It grants its owner the power to kill someone
simply by writing that person's name in it.

178
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:38,257
Light Yagami took it upon himself to
punish criminals using that notebook.

179
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:41,240
He soon became known to the world as Kira.

180
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,649
You also possess that same power.

181
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:50,139
In fact, your ability was even greater than his.

182
00:10:50,905 --> 00:10:52,793
You managed to find Light

183
00:10:52,837 --> 00:10:56,739
by using your power to determine
that he was, in fact, Kira.

184
00:10:56,874 --> 00:10:58,359
Light is Kira?

185
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,645
And I'm the second Kira?

186
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,604
That's right.

187
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:03,712
Or rather, that used to be the case.

188
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:07,136
Light arranged it so you would both lose this power.

189
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:09,562
This was all according to his plan.

190
00:11:10,163 --> 00:11:11,103
He did?

191
00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:13,085
Then Ryuzaki was right.

192
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:18,270
Misa, do you still love Light enough to die for him?

193
00:11:21,043 --> 00:11:22,691
Unbelievable.

194
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,442
You've got to be telling the truth.

195
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,055
You already know everything about me.

196
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,740
I totally believe you now.

197
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:32,753
And yes, I do love him.

198
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:33,637
To death.

199
00:11:34,272 --> 00:11:37,648
Not to mention how amazing it is
that Light and I were both Kira.

200
00:11:37,673 --> 00:11:40,017
Of course I'd want to believe something like that.

201
00:11:40,344 --> 00:11:42,139
I only wish I could remember it.

202
00:11:43,358 --> 00:11:45,717
You haven't changed, Misa.

203
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:50,125
And it seems your feelings for
Light will never change, either.

204
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:55,107
It's enough to convince me that the
only way you can be truly happy in life

205
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,447
is if you can support him in his plan.

206
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,020
Thank you, Shinigami.

207
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,171
It's Rem.

208
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,982
The current Kira is a vile and pathetic human being.

209
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:07,133
I don't know what he's capable of.

210
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:11,304
Be careful, and beware of the others from Yotsuba.

211
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:12,197
Trust Light.

212
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,019
Let him do whatever he feels necessary.

213
00:12:15,091 --> 00:12:16,372
OK. I got it.

214
00:12:16,397 --> 00:12:19,052
I guess I should just act normal
in the meantime though, right?

215
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:20,267
That's right.

216
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:22,638
When you go back to the interview,

217
00:12:22,663 --> 00:12:26,293
you will be able to see for yourself who the real Kira is.

218
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:29,029
Be on your guard, and do not trust him.

219
00:12:29,828 --> 00:12:32,322
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry I took so long.

220
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:34,696
I was just fixing up my makeup a little.

221
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:39,702
Listen. When you return, I will be in the room.

222
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:42,250
The man sitting in front of me will be Kira.

223
00:12:43,907 --> 00:12:47,029
The person in front of you is Kira.

224
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,969
Higuchi's Kira?

225
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,578
That bastard!

226
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:12,417
Misa Misa sure is late.

227
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:15,658
Hm?

228
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:16,488
They're back.

229
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:18,843
Hey!

230
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,746
I'm exhausted.

231
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:23,560
Hey.

232
00:13:23,854 --> 00:13:24,910
How did it go?

233
00:13:24,966 --> 00:13:29,339
Yotsuba agreed to hire Misa on as their
spokesperson for the new ad campaign.

234
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:31,711
I see. That's good to hear.

235
00:13:32,176 --> 00:13:34,783
And I made sure to give them my cell phone number.

236
00:13:34,954 --> 00:13:39,500
Would you believe three out of seven guys
already messaged me asking for a private date?

237
00:13:39,628 --> 00:13:40,168
What?

238
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:43,796
So now I accept their invitations
and investigate them, right?

239
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:45,367
Oh, it's going exactly as I planned.

240
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:47,526
No. The plan's getting canceled right now.

241
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,103
Huh? But why.

242
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,463
Everything's been going so smoothly up until now.

243
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:53,931
If w go any further, you'll be in danger.

244
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:56,932
You can still appear in their commercials,

245
00:13:57,377 --> 00:14:02,237
but from now on you should deny that you were suspecting
of being the second Kira, and was detained by L.

246
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:05,079
Mogi will continue being your bodyguard,

247
00:14:05,352 --> 00:14:07,932
but you'll be working solely as a celebrity.

248
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:12,719
If that's what you want, Light, then that's what I'll do.

249
00:14:15,974 --> 00:14:18,025
Oh, well. I'm feeling pretty tired.

250
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,798
Tomorrow's shoot is bright and
early, so I'd better get some sleep.

251
00:14:22,616 --> 00:14:25,974
Thank you, Light. You're so sweet to be worried about me.

252
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:28,270
But I've thought of the best plan ever.

253
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,067
I'm gonna be useful to you.

254
00:14:31,215 --> 00:14:32,256
I promise.

255
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:38,171
Hey, Light? Wanna come sleep with me tonight?

256
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:40,050
Wh... What are you talking about?

257
00:14:40,415 --> 00:14:41,501
Just kidding.

258
00:14:41,526 --> 00:14:43,981
You're saving it for after we catch Kira, right?

259
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:45,704
You don't have to be shy about it.

260
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:46,840
Hm?

261
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:49,295
Yes, Light. There's no need to be shy.

262
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,892
I'm not being shy.

263
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:52,789
No need to be so serious, either.

264
00:14:54,382 --> 00:14:55,180
Cut!

265
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:57,831
OK, that's a wrap.

266
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,220
Good work, everyone!

267
00:14:59,624 --> 00:15:00,358
Good job!

268
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:01,416
Thanks a lot, Miss Amane!

269
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:03,262
Great job, Misa Misa.

270
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:04,054
Thanks, Motchi.

271
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,224
Can you take me to the restroom in that hospital?

272
00:15:06,249 --> 00:15:07,356
No problem.

273
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:08,964
I'll be waiting!

274
00:15:09,371 --> 00:15:11,757
I'll be sure not to take too long, OK?

275
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:16,672
Yes?

276
00:15:17,701 --> 00:15:19,917
Misa. You actually made it.

277
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,202
Nori, you look so cute in that nurse's outfit.

278
00:15:23,614 --> 00:15:24,857
You really think so?

279
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,198
That went well.

280
00:15:41,343 --> 00:15:43,066
What an amazing car.

281
00:15:43,091 --> 00:15:45,553
If you like it, I'll give you a ride anytime.

282
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,085
Or buy you one of your own.

283
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:50,218
By the way, loving that nurse's outfit, Misa.

284
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:51,765
I'm glad you like it.

285
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:55,445
That took a while.

286
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:03,239
Ah!

287
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:04,911
Where's Misa?

288
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:06,016
She's on a date.

289
00:16:06,108 --> 00:16:07,525
You've got to be kiddin'.

290
00:16:19,721 --> 00:16:21,298
Kyosuke Higuchi.

291
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:25,598
The sleazy pervert who's been sending
me text messages ever since that party.

292
00:16:25,623 --> 00:16:28,594
He's been even more persistent than any of the other guys.

293
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,406
He's Kira?

294
00:16:30,587 --> 00:16:32,484
It can't get any worse than that.

295
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:34,687
Hey, Misa?

296
00:16:34,712 --> 00:16:35,075
Huh?

297
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,723
How about we grab a bite to eat?

298
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,716
Are you planning to take me
somewhere and do pervy things to me?

299
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:44,019
Well, even if you are, that's OK.

300
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,989
I'll be fine. Since I can kill people.

301
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:51,056
What are you saying, Misa?

302
00:16:51,192 --> 00:16:53,373
Is this part of Light Yagami's plan?

303
00:16:53,617 --> 00:16:55,494
Is this what he wants you to do?

304
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:59,435
Or is this your way of telling
me that you want me to kill Higuchi

305
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,280
the moment he tries to do anything?

306
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,015
Come on, you're just getting with me, aren't you, Misa?

307
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,545
You can kill people?

308
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:08,304
Yep. It's true.

309
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,593
And you know why?

310
00:17:10,132 --> 00:17:12,237
Because I'm the second Kira.

311
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:14,874
That can't be.

312
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,379
Even if she was the second Kira before,

313
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,059
there's no way she still is.

314
00:17:19,313 --> 00:17:21,643
She's not supposed to have any memory of it, either.

315
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,925
What the hell's going on?

316
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,848
Oh, Misa.

317
00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:29,074
You don't have to make up stuff
like that to feel safe with me.

318
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:31,656
I'm sure you'll find that I'm quite the gentleman.

319
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:33,250
Yeah, maybe.

320
00:17:33,337 --> 00:17:37,129
Anyway, I'll only prove that I'm
the second Kira to the real Kira.

321
00:17:37,288 --> 00:17:39,188
You'll only show proof to Kira?

322
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:39,968
Why?

323
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:44,932
I'd show him because it's always
been my dream to become Kira's wife.

324
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:47,602
I know he'll need me by his side once I tell him.

325
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:50,860
If she really is the second Kira,

326
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:55,528
then it's pretty clear from the Sakura TV
incident that she has the Shinigami eyes.

327
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:59,608
If that's the case, I need to make
sure I keep this girl by my side.

328
00:17:59,728 --> 00:18:00,967
At all costs.

329
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:03,377
I've got to test her, first.

330
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:11,310
Well, since I happen to be Kira,
does that mean you'll marry me?

331
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:15,129
Hm?

332
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:18,320
Really?

333
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:19,801
Yeah.

334
00:18:20,495 --> 00:18:21,320
I mean it.

335
00:18:21,616 --> 00:18:22,516
What?

336
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,641
Then prove it to me.

337
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,366
Come on, let's prove it to each other.

338
00:18:25,636 --> 00:18:26,935
I can't do that.

339
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,451
It'd be a pretty bad idea to let
someone witness how I kill people.

340
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,880
You think so?

341
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:35,011
I dunno. I thought someone was Kira,

342
00:18:35,036 --> 00:18:36,612
I think I'd be willing to show them.

343
00:18:36,694 --> 00:18:39,285
We'd never get anywhere if I didn't.

344
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,141
Then why don't you kill someone?

345
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:43,612
After all, I could be the real Kira.

346
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,829
All right. But I only kill bad people, OK?

347
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:47,970
That's right.

348
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:49,639
Bad person, huh?

349
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:57,318
This is Ginzo Kaneboshi,
president of a major finance company.

350
00:18:57,343 --> 00:18:59,670
He's infamous for his immoral collection methods.

351
00:18:59,695 --> 00:19:02,717
Sometimes he even makes people
pay with their insurance money.

352
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:03,539
How about him?

353
00:19:03,564 --> 00:19:06,150
Would you be able to confirm his death right away?

354
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:07,722
Yeah. As soon as I call him.

355
00:19:07,908 --> 00:19:09,044
OK, then.

356
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:11,085
Could you turn around for just a sec?

357
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:15,774
Misa.

358
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:19,215
You want me to kill Ginzo Kaneboshi, don't you?

359
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:23,340
Then Higuchi will believe your
claim about being the second Kira.

360
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:24,744
Very well.

361
00:19:26,876 --> 00:19:28,882
All right. He should be dead by now.

362
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:33,320
Hello, this is Higuchi from Yotsuba.

363
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:35,676
Sorry. Our president just collapsed and stopped breathing.

364
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:36,709
Call back later.

365
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:44,777
Told ya.

366
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,317
She killed him.

367
00:19:48,098 --> 00:19:50,599
The same guy I chose just a minute ago.

368
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:54,142
It would've been impossible to
do that unless she had the power.

369
00:19:54,354 --> 00:19:55,446
This proves it.

370
00:20:01,883 --> 00:20:04,801
So. If I'm Kira, you'll marry me, right?

371
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:09,169
Wha Hey, why are you getting so serious all of a sudden?

372
00:20:09,737 --> 00:20:11,240
Because I'm Kira.

373
00:20:11,305 --> 00:20:12,519
Then prove it.

374
00:20:12,818 --> 00:20:13,465
Hm.

375
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:16,231
I'm not going to be able to kill until I get home.

376
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,873
You understand?

377
00:20:18,606 --> 00:20:21,085
Oh, well, that's no good then.

378
00:20:21,406 --> 00:20:26,283
For all I know, you're just making all this up
so you have an excuse to take me to your place.

379
00:20:26,321 --> 00:20:27,405
Wait! I know.

380
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,046
Huh?

381
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,948
Why don't you stop killing the criminals on TV.

382
00:20:30,973 --> 00:20:32,016
That should prove it.

383
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,092
If you're Kira, it should be no problem.

384
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,853
You can start killing again when I tell you to.

385
00:20:36,905 --> 00:20:38,641
If all the times and deaths match up,

386
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,655
then I'll believe you.

387
00:20:40,196 --> 00:20:43,747
After all, killing criminals in that
way is something that only Kira can do.

388
00:20:44,856 --> 00:20:46,156
I see what you mean.

389
00:20:46,254 --> 00:20:47,641
That's a good idea.

390
00:20:48,858 --> 00:20:50,058
All right, Misa.

391
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,576
I'm Kira, so in order to make
you trust me and prove that I'm him,

392
00:20:53,601 --> 00:20:56,227
I'll stop killing criminals for the time being.

393
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:58,580
Then, once you're fully convinced I'm the real thing,

394
00:20:58,605 --> 00:21:00,314
you and I can get married.

395
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:06,465
And so, based on what he said, Higuchi is Kira!

396
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:10,224
Now we not only know Kira's identity,

397
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:13,236
but all those deaths that were
worrying the chief are gonna stop!

398
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,949
That's amazing, Misa Misa!

399
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,725
It's been three days since I stopped killing criminals.

400
00:22:39,778 --> 00:22:41,233
That should be good enough.

401
00:22:41,258 --> 00:22:44,291
Now if I marry Misa Amane, the second Kira,

402
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:46,321
I'll have the Shinigami eyes.

403
00:22:46,346 --> 00:22:50,044
With that power, Yotsuba will be under my control.
