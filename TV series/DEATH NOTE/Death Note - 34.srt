1
00:01:27,752 --> 00:01:29,652
I'm going to announce my engagement to Light

2
00:01:29,677 --> 00:01:31,386
at the Pop Music Festival.

3
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:35,551
I used to really like Kira too, but I know for sure

4
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:37,151
that Light is gonna catch him soon.

5
00:01:37,718 --> 00:01:40,844
And as for you, you'll probably be executed.

6
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,869
You are to send me a fan latter that
I'll be able to recognize as yours.

7
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:47,561
You will also enclose something else in the envelope.

8
00:01:47,785 --> 00:01:49,610
Five blank pages from the notebook.

9
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:54,496
Carry on with your judgments and killings as
usual until I received the letter and the pages.

10
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:56,204
And how after you receive them?

11
00:01:56,396 --> 00:01:59,234
Make a notebook that looks as
close to the original as possible,

12
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,619
and act as if you're killing people by using this decoy.

13
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,469
Aw, come on now, lady.

14
00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:07,205
I mean, wearing a short skirt like that in the winter.

15
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,411
Please, someone.

16
00:02:14,096 --> 00:02:15,096
Delete.

17
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:16,337
He's getting off the train.

18
00:02:27,517 --> 00:02:30,203
A man who was on the same train as Mikami just collapsed.

19
00:02:30,228 --> 00:02:33,029
He was harrassing a young woman
and suddenly fell to the floor.

20
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:36,473
It all happened about a half a minute
after he wrote something in the notebook.

21
00:02:36,538 --> 00:02:37,904
That's gotta be it.

22
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:40,365
Well, now we know for sure.

23
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:41,621
Yes.

24
00:02:42,118 --> 00:02:46,250
Our next order of business is to
get as close as possible to Mikami.

25
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:49,725
But before we rush in blindly, there's
something we need to be careful of,

26
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:52,949
and that is the being known as the Shinigami.

27
00:02:53,496 --> 00:02:55,809
The Shinigami will be loyal to Mikami,

28
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:58,971
and it will warn him if it discovers we're following him.

29
00:02:59,752 --> 00:03:03,293
But the Shinigami can only be seen by
those people who have touched the notebook.

30
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:07,338
It's going to be pretty difficult to be
careful of something we can't even see.

31
00:03:07,984 --> 00:03:10,260
We're going to try, no matter how difficult.

32
00:03:11,874 --> 00:03:13,321
Right. Understood, sir.

33
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:24,297
Light's having another one of his
meetings with Takada this evening.

34
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:27,262
Right after they started having these encounters,

35
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:29,287
Takada got a phone call from Kira,

36
00:03:29,362 --> 00:03:31,841
and all the surveillance cameras had to be removed.

37
00:03:32,991 --> 00:03:34,864
The first thing that came to my mind

38
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:38,341
was that they'd be able to
communicate secretly by writing messages.

39
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:40,246
Everything checks out in here.

40
00:03:41,073 --> 00:03:43,606
I've gone over the entire room, and there's nothing in it.

41
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,580
There's only the wiretap on me.

42
00:03:46,096 --> 00:03:47,106
Uh, right.

43
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:48,830
Then all that's left is the bathroom.

44
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:57,707
Why does Light care so much about
checking for cameras and wiretaps?

45
00:03:58,185 --> 00:04:02,222
Never mind that, why is Kira allowing
these meetings in the first place?

46
00:04:02,484 --> 00:04:04,430
Something just doesn't add up.

47
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:12,295
If they really are writing notes to each other,

48
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:14,462
there's only one way to prove it.

49
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:23,102
Light. I thought you should know.

50
00:04:23,618 --> 00:04:26,385
I had a private chat with Ms. Misa Amane yesterday.

51
00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:28,158
About what?

52
00:04:28,183 --> 00:04:30,716
Whoa. Oh boy, Light's in trouble now.

53
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:31,692
Matsuda.

54
00:04:31,717 --> 00:04:34,021
Is there some reason you're so happy about this?

55
00:04:34,046 --> 00:04:38,969
She told me that she's planning to announce her engagement
to you during her appearance at the Pop Music Festival.

56
00:04:40,851 --> 00:04:42,274
Whoa. He's busted.

57
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:43,247
Light's in the dog house!

58
00:04:43,272 --> 00:04:44,684
Shut up, Matsuda!

59
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:46,024
No.

60
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,117
She thinks we're together because I
haven't been able to break it to her yet,

61
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:50,847
but she means nothing to me.

62
00:04:51,307 --> 00:04:53,310
Misa, you idiot.

63
00:04:53,474 --> 00:04:55,065
Why pull a stunt like that?

64
00:04:55,118 --> 00:04:57,167
No. Takada. you're just as bad.

65
00:04:57,192 --> 00:04:58,833
Why are women like this?

66
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,537
Nothing, you say?

67
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:03,361
Why should I believe you?

68
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:08,238
She was in charge of killing before T.

69
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,378
Somehow she gained the same power as I had

70
00:05:11,403 --> 00:05:13,336
and found out that I was Kira.

71
00:05:13,517 --> 00:05:16,753
In the end, I had no choice but to take her as my partner.

72
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:20,801
It's the only reason I would
ever choose such an impulsive girl.

73
00:05:21,607 --> 00:05:24,107
So, Misa was doing Kira's killings.

74
00:05:24,274 --> 00:05:27,322
But right now, I'm the one doing it for him.

75
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,749
Light had no choice with Misa,

76
00:05:29,774 --> 00:05:32,534
but he chose me specially to help him.

77
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,621
Believe me. She's nothing.

78
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,656
You're the only one for me.

79
00:05:37,852 --> 00:05:39,585
You're the only one for me?

80
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,243
Is that supposed to be serious?

81
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,168
I expected better from you, Light.

82
00:05:43,193 --> 00:05:44,242
She does have a point.

83
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:46,697
I mean, that's a really cheesy line, especially for Light.

84
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,411
So which one do you think he'll pick?

85
00:05:48,436 --> 00:05:49,973
Amane or Takada?

86
00:05:50,097 --> 00:05:52,383
Well, he could keep two timing them.

87
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:53,408
Are you serious?

88
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:55,151
You don't see any problem with that?

89
00:05:55,574 --> 00:05:56,986
Hey, I'm not the one who...

90
00:05:57,011 --> 00:05:58,274
Will you two shut up?

91
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,546
You're going to have to prove yourself from now on, Light,

92
00:06:03,722 --> 00:06:05,026
but I will trust you.

93
00:06:05,474 --> 00:06:07,837
Of course, if I find out that you're lying,

94
00:06:07,862 --> 00:06:09,071
you'll pay dearly.

95
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:12,125
In fact, I'll tell Kira about it.

96
00:06:14,104 --> 00:06:15,004
Kira, huh?

97
00:06:15,696 --> 00:06:18,801
You know, I understand that the
world really needs Kira right now,

98
00:06:18,998 --> 00:06:21,016
but I just can't help but wonder.

99
00:06:21,707 --> 00:06:24,501
Will the day ever come when you and I can be together?

100
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,471
I can't help but hate Kira for choosing you
as a spokesperson, because it keeps us apart.

101
00:06:30,496 --> 00:06:33,536
I don't mind if he kills criminals,
but we've done nothing wrong.

102
00:06:34,651 --> 00:06:37,439
We have the right to lead happy lives, don't we?

103
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:43,984
Yes. I want to be happy together with you.

104
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:48,934
But that could only happen if Kira wasn't around.

105
00:06:49,707 --> 00:06:50,542
You're right.

106
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:52,571
If only Kira wasn't around.

107
00:06:54,674 --> 00:06:57,716
Kira should be arrested.

108
00:07:02,617 --> 00:07:03,385
It's true.

109
00:07:03,929 --> 00:07:07,472
If you and I are ever going to
have a chance at being happy together,

110
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,135
Kira needs to be caught.

111
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:11,587
W... Wait a minute, Kiyomi.

112
00:07:11,763 --> 00:07:13,314
Do you seriously mean that?

113
00:07:13,506 --> 00:07:14,181
Yes.

114
00:07:14,873 --> 00:07:18,052
All right, but if I'm going to
arrest him, I'll need your help.

115
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:20,084
You'll be putting yourself in danger.

116
00:07:20,162 --> 00:07:25,354
After all, I'll be defying the police, and you'll
be going against Kira and the entire world as well.

117
00:07:26,926 --> 00:07:29,821
Are you sure... that's OK?

118
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:39,752
That's a long pause.

119
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:43,833
All right.

120
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:47,815
If cooperating with you means that we can be together,

121
00:07:47,932 --> 00:07:50,405
then I'm prepared to make that sacrifice, Light.

122
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,830
What a turn around.

123
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:53,655
Just like you'd expect from our guy!

124
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,004
He was able to move the conversation from
cheating on Misa Misa to getting Taki to help him.

125
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:03,348
Mikami's talking to himself.

126
00:08:03,385 --> 00:08:04,593
What's going on?

127
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:09,004
He was too far away for me to pick up his
voice, but I recorded video of his lips moving.

128
00:08:10,062 --> 00:08:12,246
I'm sending you the footage I was able to get.

129
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:14,145
It's of Mikami during his lunch break.

130
00:08:15,152 --> 00:08:17,304
This is it right here. He's saying something.

131
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,685
Show it to us one more time in slow motion.

132
00:08:28,685 --> 00:08:32,432
Is that you, Shinigami, is what he said.

133
00:08:34,107 --> 00:08:36,991
He seems to have reacted to
the scrap of paper at his feet.

134
00:08:37,112 --> 00:08:39,061
He just gave a small sigh.

135
00:08:39,674 --> 00:08:42,052
At this point, he talks to himself a little more.

136
00:08:42,118 --> 00:08:43,656
I'm gonna zoom in on his lips.

137
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,808
That Shinigami.

138
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:54,062
Ever since he...

139
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:58,813
handed me the notebook,

140
00:09:00,276 --> 00:09:03,808
he hasn't reappeared.

141
00:09:04,218 --> 00:09:05,747
That Shinigami.

142
00:09:05,772 --> 00:09:07,640
Ever since he handed me the notebook,

143
00:09:07,665 --> 00:09:09,659
he hasn't reappeared.

144
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:14,900
Mikami was given the notebook by one of the Shinigami,

145
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,128
but it seems that Shinigami hasn't been following him.

146
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:24,462
So that's how it is.

147
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:29,747
I guess that's all for today.

148
00:09:29,978 --> 00:09:31,182
See you next time.

149
00:09:31,463 --> 00:09:32,409
Of course.

150
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:36,893
It's finally over.

151
00:09:36,918 --> 00:09:39,357
Man, things got pretty intense today, don't you think?

152
00:09:39,382 --> 00:09:41,121
It's tough to do this for hours on end.

153
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:44,169
Yeah. You really look like you're suffering.

154
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:47,368
All right. I'm gonna wrap things up at the hotel.

155
00:09:47,684 --> 00:09:49,315
OK, thanks for all your hard work.

156
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:53,761
You know, I feel kind of bad that Aizawa is stuck
with booking the hotel and checking out every time.

157
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:20,820
It's gone.

158
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:23,292
The mark I left is gone.

159
00:10:33,441 --> 00:10:34,981
I left four marks.

160
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,707
Two of them are gone.

161
00:10:37,496 --> 00:10:39,451
The room's been left just as it was.

162
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:41,339
Housekeeping hasn't come in yet.

163
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:46,971
Then how and why would anyone
switch these two notepads for new ones?

164
00:10:47,752 --> 00:10:49,175
That settles it.

165
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,341
They're writing notes.

166
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:56,893
Yes?

167
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:00,791
What's that?

168
00:11:00,965 --> 00:11:03,544
You want to meet and talk with Near in person?

169
00:11:10,951 --> 00:11:12,534
Mr. Aizawa.

170
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:13,830
It's been a while.

171
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,333
And it's a pleasure to meet you.

172
00:11:16,465 --> 00:11:17,842
That's very nice of you,

173
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:20,216
but kind of hard to accept while I'm blindfolded.

174
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:22,746
He doesn't have any weapons or cameras on him.

175
00:11:23,195 --> 00:11:25,902
In that case, you're free to take off your blindfold.

176
00:11:28,172 --> 00:11:28,715
Huh?

177
00:11:33,296 --> 00:11:36,715
Near, I believe what you said earlier.

178
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,698
L was been meeting Takada almost every single night.

179
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:40,798
I know.

180
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:43,657
Well, then what about this?

181
00:11:43,682 --> 00:11:45,525
They are passing notes to each other.

182
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:46,635
I confirmed it.

183
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:51,644
Mr. Aizawa, please don't take
any unnecessary actions on your own.

184
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,613
Unnecessary actions?

185
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:59,139
Yes This is not the point where we bring up
evidence against Kira and openly confront him.

186
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:03,371
I must corner him in a dead end with
a plan that would guarantee his defeat.

187
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:05,823
This is what it will take to stop him for good.

188
00:12:06,414 --> 00:12:09,076
Mr. Aizawa, I'm going to be blunt with you.

189
00:12:09,614 --> 00:12:12,577
You and the rest of the task
force are already out of the picture.

190
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:18,234
However, if you still want to help capture Kira, you can.

191
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,509
All I want you to do is keep an
eye on him, as you've been doing.

192
00:12:22,485 --> 00:12:24,283
That's it? Keep an eye on him?

193
00:12:24,573 --> 00:12:25,343
Yes.

194
00:12:25,863 --> 00:12:29,387
Of course, there certainly is
a purpose in watching over L.

195
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:33,222
In fact, I've already taken it
into account as part of my plan.

196
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,133
That's why I'm hoping you can help me in that respect.

197
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:39,458
I want you to watch him, in order to win against Kira.

198
00:12:40,062 --> 00:12:43,137
And after that, I want you to be a witness...

199
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:45,377
to the end of Kira.

200
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:05,882
This has been a year of breathroughs for
me, and I'm sure for many others as well.

201
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:11,461
And what better way to bring this year to an
exciting close than with the EastWest Pop Music Festival?

202
00:13:11,979 --> 00:13:14,679
I'm your host for this evening, Kiyomi Takada.

203
00:13:14,956 --> 00:13:16,859
We hope you all enjoy the show.

204
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:19,759
All right, the Pop Music Festival's about to begin!

205
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:23,460
Matsuda, shouldn't you be checking
over the reports on Kira's killings?

206
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:24,484
Yeah. In a minute.

207
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:25,877
But after Misa Misa performs.

208
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:27,414
She's the opening act this year.

209
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,265
We got to cheer her on. Yeah!

210
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:35,975
Can we help you?

211
00:13:38,056 --> 00:13:38,619
Hm?

212
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,167
Pardon me.

213
00:13:40,222 --> 00:13:41,740
We're from the SPK.

214
00:13:41,867 --> 00:13:43,263
We'll need you to come with us.

215
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:47,823
Before we continue,

216
00:13:47,848 --> 00:13:51,309
I'm afraid I must apologize on behalf of the staff of NHN.

217
00:13:51,478 --> 00:13:52,884
It's very unfortunate,

218
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:57,594
but it seems that this year's opening act, Ms.
Misa Amane, has not entered the concert hall yet.

219
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:58,161
Huh?

220
00:13:58,433 --> 00:13:59,049
What?

221
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:01,122
Of course, many unexpected things can...

222
00:14:01,147 --> 00:14:01,907
What's going on?

223
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:03,990
Mogi didn't tell us anything about this.

224
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,494
Take me back to NHN right now!

225
00:14:10,355 --> 00:14:11,613
What is this?

226
00:14:11,638 --> 00:14:14,467
Are you trying to ruin my reputation?

227
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:17,329
Misa Misa, you've got to try and stay calm.

228
00:14:17,354 --> 00:14:18,927
Motchi, why should I?

229
00:14:19,156 --> 00:14:21,308
We need to do this in order to catch Kira.

230
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,232
But that has nothing to do with me.

231
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,216
You should know that I was going to
take you at gunpoint as a last resort.

232
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:28,786
But you didn't resist.

233
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:30,001
That was a great help.

234
00:14:30,147 --> 00:14:31,491
Thank you, Mr. Mogi.

235
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,067
I probably would have resisted if I
hadn't listen to what Aizawa told me. But...

236
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:41,940
after hearing about the notepads,
there's no doubt in my mind.

237
00:14:44,672 --> 00:14:46,076
What's going on?

238
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,348
Near.

239
00:14:48,658 --> 00:14:50,208
Yes? What is it, L?

240
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,657
We have a problem.

241
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,666
Mogi and Misa Amane have gone missing.

242
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:55,603
I'm already aware of that.

243
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:57,710
I was the one who took them into custody.

244
00:14:58,283 --> 00:14:59,080
He what?

245
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:00,510
For what reason?

246
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:02,784
Oh, just in case.

247
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:09,201
Near, kidnapping is a blatant criminal act.

248
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:11,023
You have to stop this now.

249
00:15:11,048 --> 00:15:13,948
Actually, Mr. Mogi and Amane both came here willingly.

250
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:15,507
You can even ask them yourself.

251
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:17,574
I'll put them on the line now.

252
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:18,852
Here they are.

253
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,032
Mogi. Misa. This is L speaking.

254
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,112
Light!

255
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:29,503
I'm told that Near is detaining you.

256
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:32,611
He said that you both agreed to it. Is that true?

257
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:36,828
It is.

258
00:15:37,456 --> 00:15:38,491
Mogi.

259
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:42,423
A... Actually, I was against the whole thing.

260
00:15:42,534 --> 00:15:45,416
But Motchi said it would be
best if I just went along quietly.

261
00:15:45,456 --> 00:15:47,911
He told me we would have both been killed if I didn't.

262
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:49,212
All right.

263
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:52,140
It's fine, as long as you both consented to this.

264
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:57,102
So now I've removed Misa Amane,

265
00:15:57,127 --> 00:15:59,638
the one who might be the second Kira from the equation.

266
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:07,054
Light Yagami, I'm sure the significance
of this move isn't lost on you.

267
00:16:08,611 --> 00:16:09,945
Hey, no way!

268
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,438
You're planning to end this without Misa Misa performing?

269
00:16:12,463 --> 00:16:13,544
God, what a rip-off!

270
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:15,744
It looks like Lidner and the others were successful.

271
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:18,923
It's past 9:00.

272
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:20,585
All right. It's my turn.

273
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:56,689
Mikami leaves work at almost the same
time every day, with only slight variations.

274
00:16:56,789 --> 00:16:59,524
He leads a completely scheduled life, for the most part.

275
00:17:00,068 --> 00:17:04,825
So, he always goes to that particular gym
every Monday and Thursday at around 9:00.

276
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,774
Is that correct?

277
00:17:05,856 --> 00:17:06,707
Yes.

278
00:17:06,732 --> 00:17:10,290
He's kept that routine for the
past four years, ever since he joined.

279
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:12,645
He didn't even skip New Year's Day.

280
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,927
I became a member and made a
few inquiries to confirm it myself.

281
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:17,411
Good.

282
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,730
So then we can assume...

283
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,700
that he'll be there on Monday the 31st as well?

284
00:17:21,725 --> 00:17:22,389
Yes.

285
00:17:22,445 --> 00:17:26,548
If he's the type of man who would go on
holidays, then he'll certainly go on New Year's Eve.

286
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:32,886
Giovanni, would it be possible for you to
touch the notebook on the 31st at the gym?

287
00:17:33,538 --> 00:17:34,157
Huh?

288
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:36,255
Yes.

289
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:39,269
I've already done a thorough
check of the hotel's security.

290
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:42,512
The locker room is definitely
free of any kind of surveillance.

291
00:17:42,617 --> 00:17:44,085
Then I'll leave it to you.

292
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:48,219
Sir, if there is a Shinigami with him,

293
00:17:48,378 --> 00:17:51,296
there's a distinct possibility
that I will die, isn't there?

294
00:17:51,556 --> 00:17:52,269
Yes.

295
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:55,093
Part of the reason you're doing
this is to test that theory.

296
00:17:55,611 --> 00:17:58,907
Even if you don't see any Shinigami
after first touching the notebook,

297
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,561
I want you to continue watching Mikami for a while longer

298
00:18:01,586 --> 00:18:04,301
before we conclude whether or
not he has one following him.

299
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:09,942
I can have Rester do it if you're too scared.

300
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,589
No. I understand. I'll do it.

301
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,792
Hm?

302
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:35,303
If there's a Shinigami around.

303
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:37,751
No. If there was one, I'd be dead.

304
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:39,668
It's too late to turn back now.

305
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:41,224
I have to touch it.

306
00:19:10,723 --> 00:19:13,328
Sir, I've succeeded in touching the notebook.

307
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:16,544
I can't confirm the existence
of any Shinigami at this time.

308
00:19:17,778 --> 00:19:21,234
Commander Rester, please connect
me with Mr. Mogi for a moment.

309
00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:22,875
Hm?

310
00:19:23,222 --> 00:19:26,998
Mr. Mogi, according to your
investigation and the rules of the notebook,

311
00:19:27,023 --> 00:19:29,596
how long can a person be controlled before their death?

312
00:19:31,078 --> 00:19:34,989
Based on the data we got from
Yotsuba's experiments, it's 23 days.

313
00:19:35,322 --> 00:19:36,378
Are you sure?

314
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:37,449
Yes.

315
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,341
I'd say that the killings done by
Yotsuba were more than enough to prove it.

316
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,107
Thank you for your assistance.

317
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,715
We have to consider the possibility

318
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:49,145
that Giovanni is already being controlled.

319
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,669
In that case, they could be making
him say that there is no Shinigami.

320
00:19:53,022 --> 00:19:57,250
That means I need to confront L in exactly 24 days,

321
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:59,911
if Giovanni is still alive until then.

322
00:20:05,815 --> 00:20:06,518
Kiyomi.

323
00:20:06,543 --> 00:20:09,009
I saw you had some trouble at the Pop Music Festival.

324
00:20:09,612 --> 00:20:10,345
Yes.

325
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:13,115
I never imagined that Ms. Amane would missing.

326
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,953
Give T an order to contact you

327
00:20:15,978 --> 00:20:18,403
and let you know as soon as he's confirmed everything.

328
00:20:18,578 --> 00:20:19,802
Once you hear from him,

329
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:23,444
I want you to send me a text message
or call me with the following message.

330
00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:25,524
I want to see you as soon as possible.

331
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,079
Photographs?

332
00:20:33,226 --> 00:20:34,003
Yes.

333
00:20:34,028 --> 00:20:36,635
I want to see exactly what he wrote in the notebook.

334
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:40,650
I want to see the pattern in how Mikami writes,

335
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:44,313
if there are any habits, and what kind of notebook it is.

336
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:45,856
I want to see it all.

337
00:20:45,993 --> 00:20:48,678
Everything in detail with my own eyes.

338
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:05,350
What do you think, Near?

339
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:06,712
Perfect.

340
00:21:06,737 --> 00:21:08,800
Giovanni has done an excellent job.

341
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:13,275
The handwriting matches that of the
records Mikami keeps as prosecutor.

342
00:21:13,323 --> 00:21:14,923
There's absolutely no doubt.

343
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:16,213
This is his handwriting.

344
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,266
I agree.

345
00:21:17,737 --> 00:21:19,543
With this, we can do it.

346
00:22:37,267 --> 00:22:39,060
The escort team has been attacked.

347
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:40,974
Ms. Takada, are you all right?

348
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:42,847
Is this Near's work again?

349
00:22:43,212 --> 00:22:45,523
No. This isn't his style.

350
00:22:45,646 --> 00:22:47,842
It's more like Mello!
