We should eat,

654
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,500
they say you can't
fight on an empty stomach.

655
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,458
Oh. Do the
really say that?

656
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,250
[SHERA giggles]
Yay!

657
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,708
[SHERA] What are we
going to eat, you guys?

658
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:52,750
[REM]
Meat on a stick!

659
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,291
[SHERA] Be more
creative than that!

660
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,375
Food is art!

661
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,625
What would you like, Alicia?

662
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,166
[ALICIA] I don't really
have a preference.

663
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,500
-[REM] Meat sticks!
-[SHERA] No!

664
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,750
Something
colorful, like fruit!

665
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:01,958
[DIABLO]
Stop fighting!

666
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,083
You're giving me a headache!

667
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,500
[ALICIA giggles]

668
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:38,750
[SHERA and REM]
You figured out a way

669
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,166
to remove our collars?

670
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,625
[WOMAN]
We're body positive here.

671
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:44,083
[DIABLO] Send the power
of my magic into Shera?

672
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,125
[SHERA]
Diablo, wait!

673
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,708
This feels incredible!
