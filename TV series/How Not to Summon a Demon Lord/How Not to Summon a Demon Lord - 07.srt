Shera from leaving.

491
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,250
Even if it meant
burning down the entire city.

492
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,250
[grunts]

493

[whimpers]

495
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,708
I'm sorry
I was late, Shera.

496
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,958
[SHERA]
Diablo. You're here.

497
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,625
You came for me.

498
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,916
[REM]
Don't worry, Shera!

499
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,250
[ALICIA]
We're here, too!

500
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,291
[groans]

501
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,375
They're just pretending

502
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,875
to be your friends.

503
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:37,833
[KEERA]
Why didn't my guards

504
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,708
notify me of intruders?

505
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,500
What are they
doing out there?

506
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,833
[DIABLO]
I take it you didn't hear

507
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:43,916
all the noise outside.

508
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,916
[KEERA screams]

509
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,250
How did this happen?

510
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,541
Where are my guards?

511
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,333
Are they
on a union break?

512
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,250
[ALL coughing]

513
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,208
[grunts]

514
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,708
Prince Keera. Help us.

515
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,500
[KEERA]
Look at this mess you made!

516
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,000
Do you know
what this is?

517
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,958
It's an international issue!

518
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,666
You want a war, don't you?

519
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,125
No, I only came here
for one purpose,

520
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,458
and that is
to find out if Shera

521
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,875
truly wanted to
come back home with you.

522
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,583
I know all about your methods,

523
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,291
and how you manipulated her.

524
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,541
[grunts]

525
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,708
Yeah, right!

526
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,041
And what kind of proof
do you have, huh?

527
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,625
[DIABLO]
The only proof I need

528
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,541
is to ask Shera once more
how she truly feels about

529
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,416
leaving with you.

530
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,000
[KEERA groans]
You're wasting your time!

531
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,666
Shera, tell him
you know in your heart

532
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,916
what must be done!

533
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,208
[whimpers]

534
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,125
I've already told you.

535
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,416
-I have to return to Greenwood.
-Huh?

536
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,916
Greenwood
is where I belong.

537
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
My family
needs me there.

538
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,416
This is time I could be
serving my homeland.

539
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,166
This isn't you, Shera!

540
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,416
[KEERA laughs]
Are you satisfied, Demon?

541
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,000
You heard her!

542
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,583
-That means nothing.
-[KEERA] What?

543
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,833
Shera!

544
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,500
As the owner of
your Enslavement Collar,

545
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,041
I command you to
express your true feelings.

546
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,125
Completely unbound

547
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,500
by other
magical influences!

548
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,250
-[REM] You got this!
-[ALICIA] It's working!

549
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,500
Don't listen to him!

550
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,166
I'm the one
that owns you!

551
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,416
Override,
override, override!

-[crackling]
-[SHERA whimpers]

553
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,583
Focus, Shera!
Don't listen to him!

554
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,500
Speak from the heart
that belongs to you!

555
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,708
Your heart, your mind,
and your body belong to me!

556
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,541
[SHERA grunting]

557
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,791
[DIABLO]
Shera. Tell us the truth.

558
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,041
What is it
you really want to do?

559
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,291
[grunts]

560
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,833
[SHERA cries]

561
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,416
I...

562
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,791
I want...
I want to be free.

563
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,500
I don't
want to stay here.

564
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,750
I want to be with Diablo
and Rem forever!

565
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,291
Nothing is more precious
or important to me

566
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,333
than the friends I've made

567
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,500
who are here for me now!

568
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,958
[growls]

569
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,250
[DIABLO]
You deserve to face judgment

570
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,833
for your actions, Keera.

571
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,791
[KEERA grunts]

572
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,583
[grunts] I don't like
this ending, damnit!

573
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,000
You're ruining my fun

574
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,875
and it's pissing me
the hell off!

575
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:15,791
[KEERA]
Have you forgotten

576
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,125
you're all commoners?

577
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,583
Maybe I should remind you!

578
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,833
[SHERA whimpers]

579
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,458
[SHERA] No, Keera!
Please don't use that!

580
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,916
You're all
sentenced to death!

581
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,208
This secret Elven
summon has the power to

582
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,541
destroy the entire
world with one throw!

583
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,041
If everything I enjoy
is going to be stolen,

584
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,541
then no one
deserves to live!

585
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,583
-As you wish.
-[SHERA and REM gasp]

586
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,083
[DIABLO]
If you dare to challenge me,

587
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,291
then I'll have to accept.

588
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,958
Good.

589
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,500
Come forth,
Force Hydra!

00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,125

What is that?

591

[ALICIA]
It's huge!

592
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,041
[SHERA]
Run, Diablo!

593
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,458
No one can
beat this Summon!

594

It's the Elven Nation's
secret weapon!

595

Oh, it's too late
for regrets, now!

[KEERA]
What the hell are you?

600

[DIABLO] You will pay
for your mistakes,

601
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,500
with your life!

-[SHERA] No!
-[CELSIOR] Keera!

[GALFORD]
It won't be good if you

604
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,458
decide
to spare him.
