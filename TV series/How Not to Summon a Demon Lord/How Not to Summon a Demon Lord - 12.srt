You kissed Klem!

00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,791
I know it was for a ritual,
but it’s more than I got.

657
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:10,916
Yeah, you should’ve asked us

658
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,625
to close our eyes.

659
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:15,208
It was pretty rude
to do it in front of us.

660
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:16,375
Shera and I have been with you

for way longer than Cookie-Klem.

662
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,125
So we’re in a fight
until you decide

663
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:21,583
you can go further with us.

You’re both ridiculous!

I’m not playing
this stupid game!

Aw, why not?
