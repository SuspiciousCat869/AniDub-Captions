00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,083
I have served
the Demon Lords

330
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,208
for generations.

331
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,625
[DIABLO]
Eulerex?

332
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,958
[TAKUMA] I remember him
from Cross Reverie, too.

333
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,250
He's been around.

334
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,375
I'd say for at least

335
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,541
three generations
of Demon Lords.

336
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,041
He's the oldest of us all.

337
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,583
And the strongest, by far.

338
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,083
[OUROU] It's true that
I have been waiting

339
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,916
for your resurrection
for a very long time.

340
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,750
Please allow me
to offer a sacrifice

341
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,750
to celebrate
this most auspicious day.

342
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,083
[KREBSKULM]
What's that mean?

343
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,291
[OUROU]
"Fortunate."

344
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,416
It would be
an honor to

345
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
slaughter the mortals

346
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,750
currently still
breathing here

347
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,166
in your presence.

348
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,541
I offer their lives
in celebration

349
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,458
of your resurrection.

350
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,958
Uh, you better not!

351
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:06,958
If you kill them,

352
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,083
where am I
gonna get cookies

353
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,333
to complete my mission?

354
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,958
Huh? Uh...

355
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,041
[OUROU]
Edelgard,

356
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,375
it appears
that the Demon Lord

357
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,833
is not interested
in killing mortals.

358
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,750
Do you happen to know
the meaning of this?

359
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:20,833
[EDELGARD]
I have no clue.

360
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,666
You know as much
as I do, buddy.

361
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,375
[OUROU]
The Demon Lord is the ruler

362
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,791
of all dark beings.

363
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,000
Dark beings
kill mortal races.

364
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,916
-This isn't right at all.
-[DIABLO grunts]

365
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,041
Therefore,
I believe

366
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,416
the only
solution we have

367
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,125
is for the incomplete
Demon Lord

368
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,750
to reincarnate again!

[EDELGARD grunts]

370
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,416
[OUROU]
What are you doing?

372
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,041
She has expressed her will.

373
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,583
We have to honor it. 'Kay?

374
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,000
Even Fallen have
purpose in this world.

375
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,541
So I will complete this
incomplete resurrection

376
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,583
of our so-called Demon Lord!

377

You crazy?

381
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,625
I won't get too close.

382
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,250
He's known as
the strongest Fallen

383
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,333
for a reason.

384
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,416
[DIABLO]
Don't worry, Rem.

385
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,250
I intend to
end this quickly.

Do you really think
such a weakling

389
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,916
can handle
all of this boss meat?

390

It's not...

391
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,416
It's not right
for a Fallen

392
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,750
to disobey
a Demon Lord.

393
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,416
A Demon Lord's
soul is limited.

394
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,916
As long as this mockery

395
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,708
of Krebskulm is alive,

396
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,625
the true Krebskulm
cannot be resurrected!

[OUROU]
I'm fairly certain

399
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,750
it was your
foolish actions

400

that have created
this incomplete resurrection

of our Lord.

How'd you dodge that one?

A tiny little Demon

dares to stand
before a Fallen.

You've lived a long life,

And you're the fool

who dares
to stand before

There's no way
he's ever heard of me.

I'm just a player.

[DIABLO]
Well. I'm impressed you

on the first shot.

[OUROU]
That can't be.

435
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,750
Magic Reflection was
the unique power of Enkvaros,

How did you?

438
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,583
[TAKUMA]
Yup. It's because I was

439

the first person to defeat
Enkvaros in the game.

I received the ring
as a reward for that event.

two generations
of Demon Lords

keep that in mind.
