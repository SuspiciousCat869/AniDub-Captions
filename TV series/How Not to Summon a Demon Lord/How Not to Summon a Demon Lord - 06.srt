I've always wondered

655
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,833
how soft it was!

656
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:56,833
Let go!

657
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,083
[SHERA giggles]

658
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,375
[REM]
Ugh! Cut it out!

659
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,833
I'm not yanking
your gigantor ears!

660
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,458
-[SHERA moans] Watch this!
-[REM gasps]

661
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,625
I did not
say you could

662
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:05,666
touch me there!

663
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,375
This is what Diablo
did to me today

664
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,000
when he was
pouring his magic

665
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,458
inside my body!

666
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,333
That's great!

667
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,208
You don't need to

668
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,833
reenact it with me!

669
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,458
[moans]

670
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,958
[SHERA]
I know, right?

671
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,666
That's what it
made me do, too!

672
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,791
[REM grunts]
You're so stupid, Shera!

673
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,000
Stop it!

674
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,791
[TAKUMA grunts]

675
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:29,291
How the hell am
I supposed to sleep now?

676
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:37,041
[flute playing]

677
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,625
Shera.

678
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,333
By this time tomorrow.

679
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,083
You'll be all mine.

680
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,541
And we can plan
our future together.

681
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,416
[laughs maniacally]

682
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,750
I can't wait for you
to bear my child!

683
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:06,958
At last!

684
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,833
[KEERA]
You're mine!

685
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,250
Do you understand me?

686
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,458
Shera!

687
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:43,375
[REM] Because I'm
her friend, that's why.

688
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,833
[DIABLO]
You have to be honest.

689
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,500
Tell me what you
really want.
