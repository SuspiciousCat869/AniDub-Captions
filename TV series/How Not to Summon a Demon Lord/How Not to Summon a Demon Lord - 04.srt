'Kay?

490
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,333
The Lord of Faltra City
has been receiving

491
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,250
several demands
from the Elves.

492
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,708
Their entire Kingdom
is requesting that

493
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,416
Shera be
handed over to them.

494
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,791
[ALL gasp]

495
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,666
The deadline's
10 days from now.

496
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,041
They said if their
demands are not met,

497
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,750
they won't hesitate
to wage a war.

498
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,083
-That so?
-Um, is he for real?

499
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,041
He thinks this is
worth starting a war?

500
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,583
Well, no.
The request is

501
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,375
 for us to
try to resolve it.

502
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,541
But he did specify
that it should be quietly.

503
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,000
You accepted
a quest to return Shera?

504
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,791
What kind of crap
are you trying to pull?

505
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,125
Woah, hold on.

506
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,708
Don't get all
Diablo dude bro on me.

507
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,458
I'm not here to
seize Shera, okay?

508
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:49,416
It just came out wrong.

509
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,583
I know not to
piss off the guy

510
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,166
who defeated
an army of Fallen.

511
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,166
[DIABLO]
Fine.

512
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,000
I'll let you
backpedal this time.

513
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,250
Good man.

514
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,333
Let me try and phrase

515
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,250
the goal of this
quest correctly.

516
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,625
[SHERA whimpers]

517
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,000
Stop a war
from breaking out

518
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,458
between us
and the Elven Kingdom.

519
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:06,958
How's that sound?

520
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,791
[CHESTER] I'm Lieutenant
General Chester Ray Galford.

521
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:40,875
Pleased to meet you.

522
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:41,958
[ALICIA] I know
we can make this work

523
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,583
if we all do it together!

524
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,875
[SHERA]
No! Let go of me!

525
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,041
[DIABLO]
Shera!
