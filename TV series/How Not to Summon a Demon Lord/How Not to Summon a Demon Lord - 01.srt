[MAN]
Cross Reverie.

00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,097
If you're not playing it,
you've heard of it.

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,807
If not, how?

4
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,101
It's the most played MMORPG
in the world.

5
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,230
It's a fantasy game
full of demons

00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,399
and elves and stuff,
but only one true Demon Lord.

7
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,818
His name... Diablo.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,196
Diablo's not an official boss.

9
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:32,407
He's a legendary player
who reigns at the highest level,

equipped with sick ass
gear and skills.

He's ridiculously strong.

12
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,706
There's just one thing
that gets him serious.

13
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,208
The rarity of his
opponent's gear?

Major awards they've earned?

Nope.

16

The only thing that makes him

17
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,758
Diablo‐out is this.

18
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,719
Hmm, those two look like
they're a couple.

19

Kill them.

You think this is
some kind of dating sim?

Bringing love into this place

22
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,394
is like begging for punishment,

23
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,063

This was the night
the unimaginable happened.

I mean, I always imagined it,
but I never thought one day

31
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,874
I'd be summoned to another world
as an actual Demon Lord.

32
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,925
Huh?

33

Ahh! Ah!

Am I sleep‐cosplaying?

37
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,442
Why do I look like Diablo?

38
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,444
Those aren't my hands.

39
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,613
Wait, I was playing games
in my room and then...

[WOMAN 1]
With that,

41
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,324

Yay, I did it!

00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,870
I summoned a monster!

45
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,997
First of all, no you didn't.

46
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,917
So deductive reasoning
concludes that it was me.

You can't have a first...

That girl with the furry ears.

Wait, no, this can't be real.

This doesn't look
anything like my neighborhood.

59
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,104
My kiss was the one that made

the ritual thing work!
I'm also the one

[DIABLO] Starfall Tower.

64
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,905
A summoning point used
as a ritual site

65
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,365
where players call upon

66
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,701
and enslave new
and rare Summons.

67
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,745
Does that mean
I'm a rare Summon?

Am I in Cross Reverie right now

because these

So that must mean it's okay
for me to talk to them?

Wait, have I ever

on the Summons, not us!

the slave collar part
in the ritual.

it reflects all magic.

It was an event reward.
