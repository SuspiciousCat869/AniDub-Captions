00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:02,291
skilled players
every now and then?

165
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,333
And fighting this guy
is like punching a baby,

166
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,291
but meaner.

167
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,208
I'm still here!

168
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,208
[DIABLO chuckles]

169
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,541
Well, at least
you're having fun.

170
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,250
I will never fall
before an enemy

171
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,750
and I am very strong!

172
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:16,958
Watch this!

173
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,000
[DIABLO chuckles]

174
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,166
Yeah, cute.
But next time, no mercy.

175
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,375
This is about
a woman's right to freedom!

176
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,416
I don't need your mercy!

177
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,875
[DIABLO] Ugh.
This is getting old.

178
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,291
Let's go!

179
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,208
[BOTH]
Stop!

180
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,208
But I'm fighting for your honor!

181
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,416
You're not helping
and it's kind of annoying.

182
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,125
[EMILE]
You mustn't give up hope, Rem!

183
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,916
-I'll be the hero you're--
-No, I'm serious.

184
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,416
[EMILE]
Huh?

185
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,208
This is all just a big oopsie.

186
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,041
[CROWD murmuring]

187
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:44,958
[REM]
Here's the deal.

188
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,791
No one put
collars on anyone.

189
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,875
I screwed up a ritual.

190
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,500
We're not enslaved,
we're just magically impaired.

191
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,750
Diablo's a friend of ours

192
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:53,916
and has actually
been trying to

193
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,708
help us get them removed.

194
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,750
[REM]
What I'm trying to say

195
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,791
without crushing
your soul is,

196
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,208
Emile, don't be
a hero, okay?

197
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,291
[DIABLO groans]

198
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,958
[EMILE laughs]

199
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,250
Then today is
my lucky day!

200
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,750
A day without
women enslaved

201
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,000
is a day for
all heroes to celebrate!

202
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,250
-[EMILE laughs]
-[TAKUMA] Is this guy medicated?

203
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,458
[EMILE]
I am sorry about that, Demon.

204
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,625
What was your name again?

205
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,000
It's Diablo.

206
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,125
I knew that.

207
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,500
I'm Emile Bichel Berger!

208
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,833
Defender of all women
and devastatingly handsome!

209
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:24,791
[chuckles]

210
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,375
If you are ever
in need of my strength

211
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,250
and devilish smile,
I'll be only a whistle away!

212
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,333
Though, I doubt you'll need

213
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,958
any assistance
in those departments!

214
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,000
[DIABLO]
Thank you?

215
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,750
[EMILE]
Until we meet again!

216
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,208
Toodles!
[laughs]

217
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,250
[TAKUMA]
Toodles?

218
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,625
That's over.

219
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:41,791
I'm sorry you
had to endure it,

220
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,958
but believe me,
we suffered with you.

221
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:44,916
[DIABLO sighs]

222
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,333
Don't be silly, Rem.

223
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,500
He was barely entertaining.

224
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,041
It's sad because
I know he means well,

225
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,583
but he comes across
more like a strong idiot.

226
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,375
[SHERA] He's a moron
with a hero complex.

227
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,416
[TAKUMA]
She said it, not me!

228
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,541
[birds chirping]

229
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,583
[SHERA singing]
I've got bottles of wine.

230
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,333
Lots of wine.

231
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,375
Off to the Bridge of Ulug!

232
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,291
[TAKUMA]
The Bridge of Ulug, huh?

233
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,041
In the game,
it was built as a fortress

234
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,625
to protect Faltra
from the monsters

235
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,291
in the Man-Eating Woods.

236
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,875
[SHERA] I cannot
get over this weather!

237
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,708
How is it okay
that we're only out here

238
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,166
to make a delivery?

239
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,333
-[SHERA giggles]
-[DIABLO] Just lucky, I guess.

240
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,375
Hey!

241
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,333
I have an idea!

242
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,416
Let's go swimming!

243
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,333
[DIABLO]
Huh?

244
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,875
Come on,
don't be a pooper pants!

245
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,041
[TAKUMA grunts]

246
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,958
And how the hell
am I supposed to do that?

247
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,000
She'd be all wet,
giggly, and bouncing,

248
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,458
and I'd just,
I'd just end up making

249
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,333
water messes or drowning!

250
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,916
[DIABLO]
Silence you fool!

251
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,041
We are in
the middle of a quest

252
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,333
and you want to
dive off a cliff?

253
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,625
Because I'm bored,
Diablo, come on!

254
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,208
Let's take a break
and do something fun!

255
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,000
Well, it would be fun
if we triggered an Invasion.

256
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,083
What's that?

257
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,416
[DIABLO]
What part about that is hard?

258
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,541
When higher-level monsters

259
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,541
appear during
a lower-level quest?

260
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,791
Huh? Why would you
want to do that?

261
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,333
[SHERA cries]

262
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,916
[DIABLO grunts]

263
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,166
I'm not strong
enough to fight

264
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,666
big ole monsters,
like you are!

265
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,291
[DIABLO]
Get off of me, you fool!

266
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,833
You can't become stronger
if you're afraid of everything!

267
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,583
I'm not gonna stay afraid
forever, of course.

268
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,291
I want to be as strong
as you and Rem, someday.

269
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,791
I want to be
an independent woman

270
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,041
of whatever century this is.

271
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,375
[DIABLO]
That's nice.

272
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,916
Goals are good to have.

273
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,041
Yep! And it's gonna happen!

274
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,875
I know you've
already done so much,

275
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,916
but I'll need your
help until I'm better.

276
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,333
So don't think you're
done with me, yet!

277
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,583
I want to keep growing
and growing and growing!

00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,875

As long as those things

00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:34,833
don't grow with her!

I swear,
she's trying to kill me!

281
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,125

Get off my horns already!

This man's not a Fallen!

[GUARD 2]
You sure?

295

I bet he's that horned demon

00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,291
that everyone around town
keeps talking about, you know?

297
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,958
The one who's got
the two collared slave girls.

298

[TAKUMA]
Saved by the gossip train.

299
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,458
We've come here
on a quest

to bring you guys
some refreshments.

301

You like wine, right?

302
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,416
[DIABLO] You know,
it's quite embarrassing for you

303
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,000
to mistake me for a Fallen,
but we can discuss that later.

304
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,083
Has something happened here?

305
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,708
[BORIS] Actually,
there's a reason why

306
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,916
we're confused
about your arrival.

307
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,541
Our patrols
informed us that

308
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,458
an army of over a hundred
Fallen is heading this way.

309
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,958
That's a lot!

00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,666
[DIABLO]
Yes, it is.

311
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,541
[BORIS]
I know, it's hard to believe.

312
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,458
[TAKUMA] The Fallen were
treated as boss monsters

in every scenario
of Cross Reverie,

314
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,083
but I've never
heard of an event

315
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,000
where they attacked en masse.

316
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,458
That's weird.

317
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,708
Maybe it's a large-scale
Invasion event

318
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,958
that was never
possible in the game.
