You...

You're still alive.

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,375
[DOLUGH]
Chuta, are you okay?

5
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:24,875
Gucchi?

6
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,750
I'll never forget that day...

7
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:33,541
...when you killed us...
by pushing us off that cliff.

8
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,166
[CHUTA]
You guys, I've got a great idea.

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,208
Let's make this
field trip awesome.

10
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,458
Let's go climb to the
top of Mount Taketori!

11
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,333
Sounds cool!

12
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,666
That does sound fun!

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,125
I'm not sure we should
go off on our own.

14
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,416
Oh, we'll be fine!

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,791
Besides, we got
some time to kill!

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,000
[CHUTA]
Didn't you hear me, before?

17
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,666
There's nothing to worry
about! It's a safe trail!

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,541
Are you talkin'
to yourself again?

19
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:58,375
[CHUTA]
Uh!

20
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,958
Yeah, you got me!

You guys, the cliff!
It's falling!

23
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,750
I can't hold them!

24
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:08,916
Chuta, help!

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,125
Just hold on!
I'm coming back down!

26
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,291
What?

27
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:17,041
Oh. Okay! The rock

00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,500
[GUCCHI]
Just think,

32
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,333
Michiyo and Matsutaro
would still be alive.

33
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,791
If only you had stayed up there,

34
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:09,583
rather than come down in
a sad attempt to help us.

35
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,375
Instead, your weight
destroyed the ledge.

36
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,458
And we all fell to our doom.

37
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,375
[DOLUGH]
Calm down, Chuta!

38
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,750
[CHUTA]
He's right. Calm down.

39
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,875
Now's your chance. Say what
you've always wanted to say.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,916
Gucchi! I'm sorry!

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Huh? You know damn well
"sorry"'s not enough!

42
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:36,458
You fool! You have no idea
what hell I went through!

43
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,833
I crashed to the ground,
barely conscious.

44
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,500
Then the rocks tumbled in.

45
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:45,125
I got to hear all my bones
that weren't yet broken shatter!

46
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:48,375
I realized I was going to die.

47
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:52,083
But suddenly, the darkness
closing in around me

48
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,875
was replaced by a bright light.

49
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,625
And through a miracle
of alien science,

50
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,083
they brought me back to life.

51
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,375
Who's "they"?

52
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,458
[DOLUGH]
Someone's coming!

53
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,166
That was a little steeper
than I was expecting!

54
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,208
Oh! 'Scuse me!

55
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,875
Would you mind taking
our picture, son?

56
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,250
Don't you dare interrupt us!

57
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,666
[DOLUGH]
Chuta, look!

58
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,916
[gasps]

59
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:23,875
[CHUTA]
No.

60
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,500
No! They didn't do
anything, Gucchi!

61
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:30,500
[GUCCHI] I did what I had
to do. What I wanted to do.

62
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:34,083
The Gucchi you knew as
a kid is dead and gone.

63
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,458
The mark of DeMille!

64
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:38,833
So that means...

65
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,416
[GUCCHI]
Yes.

66
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,333
They are the ones who brought me
back to life, so I joined them.

67
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:47,083
In turn, they've made me captain
of my very own spaceship.

68
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,791
[CHUTA]
No. It can't be!

69
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,250
My mission is to analyze
any Earth defenses

70
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,083
that are a hurdle to DeMille's
plans for conquest.

71
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,708
This means finding out the
strength of elDLIVE here.

72
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,500
I knew the local bureau had
Space Police undercover

73
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,250
at Shirobori Middle School.

74
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,583
But I didn't know
who they were yet.

75
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,375
So I sent in two grunts to
find the elDLIVE members

76
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,708
by using a sleep-inducing SPH.

77
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,833
So that was all
part of your plan.

78
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,958
Or should I say, DeMille's plan.

79
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,958
[GUCCHI] Yeah, but the
biggest surprise was on me,

80
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,166
learning that you're in elDLIVE.

81
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,166
Although, you do give
me the chance now

82
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,750
to accomplish my
secondary objective.

83
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,291
What's that?

84
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,791
To steal the
Monitalien from you.

85
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,125
You can't! He's a part of me!

86
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:30,916
[DOLUGH gasps]

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,458
Ah. Hi there, fella.

88
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,625
Within that small Monitalien
is undiscovered technology

89
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,125
from the ancient
planet Griffith.

90
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,041
It's value is immeasurable.

91
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,958
It's impossible to remove him!

92
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,791
You can't just pull him out!

93
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,916
That's only true
if you're alive.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,541
Don't worry. I'm not
gonna kill you, Chuta.

95
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,750
A dead host is a problem for
even mature Monitaliens.

96
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,750
It causes them to lose
all accumulated data.

97

[CHUTA gasps]

98
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:01,083
But with DeMille's tech,
I can separate you two.

00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,958
While you're still
alive and well.

100

I don't wanna get cut, Chuta!

101

Well, I don't wanna
get cut, either!

Oh, no! Misuzu and Chips!

106
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,041
Considering that
we're old friends,

107
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,541
if you hand over the
Monitalien without a fuss,

108
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,291
I'll give your
friends back to you.

109
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,750
I'll even forgive
you for throwing me

off the side of Mount Taketori.

00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,375
I still know you
quite well, Chuta.

112
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:31,083
You've blamed yourself for that
day ever since, haven't you?

113
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,958
Even though I'm the
one who was wronged,

114
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,708
I'm willing to let it go.

115
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,833
You won't have to carry
that guilt anymore.

All the pain? Gone?

Chuta! I'm starting
to fade away!

119

If giving him up will help you
finally forgive me, then--

[DOLUGH]
Chuta!

121
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,416
[CHUTA] I just want to
put it all behind me!

No, Chuta!

123

[GUCCHI] Give me the
Monitalien from your chest

124
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,625
and I will take the weight
off your shoulders.

Just shut up!

All I have to do
is give you away

130

and everything that's happened,

finally made a decision.

I can beat bad guys like you.

back to Earth,

00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,500
Red wrapper? Is that--?

162
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:42,166
[DOLUGH] That's the wrapper for
the antidote to the sleep-SPH.

163
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,041
[CHUTA clears throat]

164
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,375
The three of you have
the right to remain silent.

165
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,708
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

166
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,458
in a galactic court of law.

167
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,583
Also, in elDLIVE
detention centers,

168
00:08:56,666 --> 00:09:00,791
you can choose from Japanese
or Western meal plans.

169
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,333
All right, that's
enough. Give it!

170
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:06,083
[CHUTA]
You'd know what I meant, huh?

171
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,916
[CHUTA]
The Western entrée is steak.

172
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,833
Japanese is... the duck!

173
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,625
Now please disappear forever!

174
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,500
SPH. The D-blade.

175
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,583
What?

176
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,875
He's good.

177
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,083
[laughing]

178
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,333
[chuckles]

179
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,416
I'd say they're evenly matched!

180
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,541
Then let's help her!

181
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,000
No, don't! You'll
just get in the way!

182
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,875
[GUCCHI]
Yeah, she's right.

183
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,250
Nothing good can ever happen

184
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,375
when Chuta Kokonose
tries to help people.

185
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,916
[yells]

186
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,083
Sonokata!

187
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,541
[GUCCHI]
Whether it's your friends

188
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,625
falling off that cliff as kids,

189
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:42,375
or this girl lying here
today, one thing is clear.

190
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:46,000
Chuta, these deaths
are your fault.

191
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,750
Gucchi, no!

192
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,583
[GUCCHI]
You had your chance and blew it.

193
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,916
[CHUTA]
Face me! Coward!

194
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,958
[GUCCHI]
This is the end of you.

195
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,458
[CHUTA]
Gucchi!

196
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,916
[DOLUGH]
Sympathy!

197
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,083
[CHUTA gasps]

198
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,666
[GUCCHI chuckles]

199
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,291
You may be a Space Cop,
but you're still the same guy.

200
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,958
You just can't leave your
friends alone, can you?

201
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,041
I'm... sorry.

202
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,041
[GUCCHI]
Now we can talk for real.

203
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,791
Huh?

204
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,458
[GUCCHI] Your blast
destroyed the recorder

205
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,583
that DeMille implants
in all their personnel

206
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,375
to keep tabs on them.

207
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,500
What?

208
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,833
[GUCCHI]
You even took out my two guys.

209
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,666
This is the first
time in a long time

210
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,375
DeMille's not monitoring me.

211
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,416
Oh, and don't worry, Chuta.

212
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,541
Those hikers aren't
actually dead.

213
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,125
What you thought was a bomb

214
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:19,416
just knocks them unconscious
and covers them with black soot.

215
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,916
It's a little trick
I've been doing

216
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,666
that DeMille hasn't
caught onto yet.

217
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,083
You're a good guy?

218
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,250
[GUCCHI laughs]

219
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,708
[GUCCHI]
Guess so.

220
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,375
And when you refused that
deal I offered earlier--

221
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,083
y'know, for the Monitalien--
it made me happy.

222
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,916
Like, that's my Chuta.

223
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,916
The same buddy I had back
when I was a little kid.

224
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,458
Gucchi! You really are you!

225
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,250
You guys love each
other, don't you?

226
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,333
What? We're just friends!

227
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,208
Wait, so all those
times as kids,

228
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,333
when you were
talking to yourself,

229
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,708
it was really to this guy?

230
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,916
Pretty weird, huh?
Found out recently.

231
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,625
'S not that funny

232
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,208
There is one other big
thing I need to tell you.

233
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,166
[CHUTA]
Hm?

234
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,458
Michiyo and Matsutaro.

235
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,833
They still have to be
alive somewhere.

236
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,666
What? You're serious?

237
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,875
Of course I am!

238
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,416
I survived. Why couldn't they?

239
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,916
That's why I'm gonna
stay with DeMille

240
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,875
for as long as I can fool them.

241
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,416
I'll use them,

242
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,166
and you use elDLIVE, and we'll
find Michiyo and Matsutaro.

243
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,000
Okay, yeah! Great idea!

244
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,625
[GUCCHI]
I know, righ--? Uh!

245
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:23,666
Are you okay?

246
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,250
[GUCCHI]
No, I got stabbed!

247
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,958
Sorry. Once again,
it's my fault.

248
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,000
You know the fall
was just an accident.

249
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,291
The edge of cliff had
already started crumbling

250
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,958
before you ever set foot on it.

251
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,666
The hardest part about
this whole thing,

252
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,041
was knowing this entire time

253
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,041
you were blaming yourself
for what happened.

254
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,625
You've got the biggest
heart there is.

255
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,250
Thanks, pal.

256
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,125
[CHUTA yelps]

257
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,500
No, wait!

258
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,208
You're in the way!

259
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,750
Don't tell anyone what I said!

260
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,833
It's better if they all
think we're enemies!

261
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,625
But wait, since you failed
your mission down here,

262
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,166
won't they kill you?

263
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,916
I'm not that easy to replace.
I am a captain, y'know.

264
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Speaking of, you should be
worrying about your own ship.

265
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,708
I won't hold back.

266
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:18,208
If my mom's ever
guilted you, I'm sorry!

267
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,625
You're lucky to be alive.

268
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,833
Next time, move.

269
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:22,583
[yelps]

270
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,625
Right. Sorry.

271
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,708
Chuta! Gucchi's gonna
attack the Bureau!

272
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,916
That's right. Sonokata!
Let's warn them!

273
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,666
[CHUTA] I get using fireworks
when the radio's out,

274
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,666
but how do they see
these from space?

275
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,041
[DOLUGH]
Stinky! Stinky...

276
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,000
[MISUZU] They're special
fireworks that contain SPH,

277
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,791
so they appear on the scanners.

278
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,291
Can we get around the jamming?

279
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,125
Almost there, Chief!

280
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,708
[MELIES]
Chief!

in the atmosphere over Japan!

That's Sonokata!

00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,458
Engage!

295
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,625
Huh? The radar's
back online, Chief!

296
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,000
[RIGGS] They've surrounded
us with space mines!

297
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,125
[LAINE]
What?

298
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,708
Shoot them down!

299
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,083
[RIGGS]
Yoyosa!

300
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,250
[CREW A] This is traffic
division! We got a hull breach!

[CREW B]
Engine status!

302

[CREW C]
Stable for now!

303
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,916
[MCCLANE] The mines are too
fast for our lasers, Chief!

304
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,250
Magnoli, where's
that SPH Barrier?

305
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,625
At full-strength now.

306
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,000
[LAINE]
Put it up!

307
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,833
[MAGNOLI] All right,
space moss, you're up!

308
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:48,625
Go out and spit as much Barrier

[MAGNOLI] SPH Barrier forming,

Welcome back, shero!

00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,625
Update now!

312
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,583
The DeMille ship's attacking
us with space mines!

313
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,875
[GUCCHI] It's better if they
all think we're enemies!

314
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,333
[CHUTA] Yeah, but can't you
pull your punches a little bit?

315
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:12,458
It's no use!

316
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,958
There're too many
mines to track!

317
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:19,375
It's your move now,
elDLIVE Captain.

318
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,833
What's wrong, Chuta?

319
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:24,416
The little space mines,
they seem so familiar.

320
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,875
That swarm of
targets from training!

321
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,583
Yeah! Right!

322
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,000
Chief, can we talk?

323
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,125
Hey! Glad you're back!

324
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,500
I know how to stop the mines!

325
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,583
[TONTO chuckles]

326
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,875
[TONTO]
You think up some crazy things.

327
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,791
[CHUTA] The mines reminded me
of our training the other day.

328
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,625
Just do your
fly-swatting moves again

329
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,750
and I'm sure we
can take 'em out!

330
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,541
Well, I'll do my best!
Chief, I'm ready to go!

331
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,875
[LAINE]
Copy that!

332
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,708
[TONTO] Connection from paw
pads to laser cannons is live.

333
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,125
Targeting hologram deployed.

334
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:01,166
This space ship is
now one with my body.

335
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,375
And the cannons one with me!

336
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,791
Take this!

337
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,166
Meow!

338
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,583
Meow-meow-meow-meow-meow-meow!

339
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,458
Wow. Nice counter strike.

340
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,125
Now watch me.

341
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,000
[gasps]

342
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,833
The mines moved out
of the lasers range!

343
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,583
This is Tonto in the cannon pod!

344
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,875
Please turn the bow of
the ship 60 degrees port!

345
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,250
[RIGGS] Roger! Turning
bow 60 degrees port!

346
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,666
No, wait! Don't move it!

347
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,875
What's wrong?

348
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,625
Fire the elmaser cannons!

349
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,333
Spread 'em out wide as you can!

350
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,500
Yoyosa!

351
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,500
Harry! The spot 30
degrees from starboard,

352
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,083
is it optimal for hitting
Japan with SPH?

353
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,166
If so, I want you to target it.

354
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,708
I think that's
where they're hiding.

355
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:50,208
But, Chief, I'm not reading
anything at that position!

356
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:53,083
[LAINE] I know she's there.
Elmaser cannon aim.

357
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,625
And fire!

358
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:03,875
[HARRY]
There it is!

359
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,666
[RIGGS]
DeMille ship, dead ahead!

360
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,625
Hey there.

361
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,541
[RIGGS]
I see what DeMille's plan was.

362
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,666
They wanted us to turn
left the whole time

363
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,375
and were usin' the mines
to draw us that way.

364
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,208
Had we turned like they wanted
us to, we'd be a big, fat target

365
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,375
for their main battle cannons.

366
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,166
So by putting himself
in their shoes,

367
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,375
the Chief found
their exact position.

368
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,541
And by guessing the
optimal spot in space

369
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,833
from which to jam our
communications and SPH radar,

370
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,083
the Chief was able to confirm

371
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,083
that DeMille's using a
new weapon against us.

372
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:37,708
Yeah, I don't get it,
but it sure sounds amazing.

373
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,666
[CREWMEMBER A]
Our stealth dome is down!

374
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,541
They've got a straight
line of attack!

375
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,041
[GUCCHI]
Well, well, well.

376
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,958
Their captain know a thing
or two about battles.

377
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,375
It's time we fall back.

378
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,791
[CREWMEMBER B]
What that? Just give up?

379
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:53,458
Calm down. We got the
data we came for.

380
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,250
You found yourself a
good Bureau, Chuta.

381
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,333
We'll see each other soon.

382
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,583
DeMille ship entering warpspeed!

383
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:06,041
They are off our radar.
All mines de-activated.

384
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,916
That was a good fight, Chief.
But too bad they got away.

385
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,166
Yeah.

386
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,833
[ALL cheering]

387
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:18,333
Wow. You had me
scared there, Gucchi.

388
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,125
You had me worried back there,
but I guess I'm just lucky.

389
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,333
Huh?

390
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,291
I'm alive 'cause you
wouldn't hand me over.

391
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,416
Well, it's not just luck.

392
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,833
What is it?

393
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,916
More like friendship?

394
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,250
[CHUTA]
When Gucchi threatened us,

395
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,625
I looked in Dolugh's
eyes and I felt

396
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,291
this sense of connection
between us.

397
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,333
[GUCCHI'S MOM]
You're Chuta Kokonose, right?

398
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,916
[CHUTA]
Hm?

399
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,166
Hi, Mrs. Mizoguchi.

400
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:57,541
It's been a while, ma'am.
I... was just leaving.

401
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,166
[GUCCHI'S MOM]
No, wait.

402
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,875
Chuta, stay.

403
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,708
You were just a little boy.

404
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,875
I never should've blamed
you for what happened.

405
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:13,000
I hope you can forgive
me. I'm sorry.

406
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,625
I remember about a month
before that field trip,

407
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,916
Ken came home covered in dirt.

408
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,916
My friends gave me this, Mom!

409
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,833
[GUCCHI'S MOM] I'll never
forget how happy he was

410
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,916
holding that little sparkly box.

411
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,541
[CHUTA] That sounds
like the time capsule

412
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,750
we all put together.

413
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,458
So Gucchi had it.

414
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,750
He must've gone back and dug it
up after we finished burying it.

415
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,833
[DOLUGH] That explains
why we couldn't find it!

416
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,625
[GUCCHI'S MOM] For years, the
box sat alone in Ken's old room.

417
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:42,458
But yesterday, I heard
a strange sound in there.

418
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,541
And when I checked,
the box was gone.

419
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:53,625
[GUCCHI'S MOM]
These things were in its place.

420
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:57,041
There's no earthly reason this
button should be in our house,

421
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,916
because he had it
pinned to his backpack

422
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,500
the morning he went
on that field trip.

423
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,375
It's like... he's alive.

424
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,750
Somehow, the fun
memories he had with you

425
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,375
are keeping his spirit alive.

426
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,708
[CHUTA] I want to tell her
how right she really is.

427
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,041
But for Gucchi, I can't.

428
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,666
[GUCCHI'S MOM]
Oh, Chuta.

429
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,750
If my Ken really did come back,

430
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:25,000
do you think you'd still
be friends with him?

431
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,291
Yes!

432
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,125
[RIGGS] I can't believe the
captain of the DeMille vessel

433
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,583
was a childhood friend
of Officer Kokonose.

434
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,166
And that's not even the
weirdest thing about all this.

435
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,375
Why's his picture
in that old file?

436
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,708
Let see, how to
explain that? You see--

437
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:43,125
Wait, Chief! Someone
from HQ just boarded!

438
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,500
Greetings!

439
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:51,083
The name's Inspector Belalugo,
with Internal Affairs.

440
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,083
Mothers sent me.

441
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,166
Chuta!

442
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,208
Now's your chance to learn
how to write up a report!

443
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,791
She's just gonna mock me.

444
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,416
"What? You don't know
how to write a report?

445
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,250
Go disappear and die."

446
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,833
[chuckles nervously]

447
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,916
I wanted to ask
about earlier today.

448
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,083
If you were just pretending

449
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,000
to be knocked out
for the kidnappers,

450
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,291
why didn't you fight
back any sooner?

451
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:21,458
Because I wanted them to take me
to their ship's captain first.

452
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,916
Oh, right.

453
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,625
Also, it gave me a chance to
see how you would hold up

454
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,375
under the enemy captain's
attempts at manipulation.

455
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,250
Had you taken his deal,
I would've made sure

456
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,791
you were dishonorably
discharged from elDLIVE.

457
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:36,291
What? You mean you're
still testing me?

458
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,166
[MISUZU]
That's right.

459
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,708
But I'm happy to say that
this time you passed.

460
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,750
I see you in a new light.

461
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,458
Why do you always
have to put me down?

462
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,708
Wait, uh, what's that?

463
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:50,291
That I see you in a new light.

464
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:51,875
Hold on! What?

465
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:54,583
She's never
complimented you before.

466
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,041
[MISUZU]
Can I finish eating my lunch?

467
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,833
Uh, Sonokata, your cheek.

468
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,083
[CHUTA chuckles]

469
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,500
[MISUZU]
Hey! Don't laugh at me!

470
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:10,000
[CHUTA] If Sonokata's
finally warming up to me,

471
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:12,375
maybe we'll get
along, after all.

472
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:13,625
Chuta!

473
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:19,416
[BELALUGO] Hold it right there,
Misuzu Sonokata!

474
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,083
You're under arrest on suspicion

475
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,291
of aiding and abetting
