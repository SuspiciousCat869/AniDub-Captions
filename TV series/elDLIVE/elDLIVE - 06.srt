1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,125
Sorry to barge in when
you're having so much fun.

2
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:19,666
I'm looking for an old geezer

3
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,000
by the name of Doctor
Taklamakan Strangelove.

4
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,250
If he doesn't show himself,
then I'll just have to--

5
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,375
[LOVE]
Hold it!

6
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:30,041
I'm right here. I am
Doctor Love, 'kay?

7
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,416
[chuckles]

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,541
How many body doubles

9
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,166
do you think I've
tracked down so far?

10
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,250
But not to worry, I can tell

11
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:44,166
if you're the real doctor or
just a decoy using my SPH.

12
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,916
Just how long are you
going to play dumb?

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,708
I don't know.

14
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,750
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

15
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,250
Don't be absurd!

16
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,916
This footage was
taken right before

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,375
the convicted murderer Dragline
escaped from police custody.

18
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,083
As you can see,
we have video,

19
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,666
captured with a special camera

20
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,833
that shows you cutting through
the grid at the detention center

21
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,000
to break him out.

22
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,250
So you can't talk
your way out of this!

23
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,791
Now tell me what
you're planning!

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,916
I don't know. I... don't know.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,458
Think I'll fall for that?

26
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,875
[SUBORDINATE A] She really
has lost consciousness, sir.

27
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:56,000
[BELALUGO] Ugh. What about
the lie-detector SPH?

28
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,125
[SUBORDINATE A]
We couldn't detect anything.

29
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,375
She's a spy, damn it!

30
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,916
And I'll get her to confess,
whatever it takes.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,291
Next in line, make your way
to Interrogation Room Six.

32
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,375
We haven't even finished
fixing Jeanrenoi-R

33
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,500
from the damage caused
by the DeMille attack.

34
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:12,916
We don't need this now.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,625
There's nothing we can do.

36
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,083
They think that
Sonokata's a suspect.

37
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,625
Suspect? She's guilty!

38
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,416
There's footage of her
letting a murderer escape

39
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,125
that was captured
with our cameras!

40
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,500
Of course the girl's a spy!

41
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,708
Misuzu hasn't confessed, chu!

42
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,875
That doesn't change the fact
that there's video proof!

43
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,708
For all we know, she might've
been spying on all of us, too.

44
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,083
[CHIPS]
There's no way, chu!

45
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,875
I've been with Misuzu since
she joined the bureau,

46
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,083
so I would know, chu!

47
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,416
Both your naïve way of thinking

48
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
and your SPH reek
of a small child!

49
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,208
Yeah, well, your attitude reeks
just as bad as your afro!

50
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,250
[BOTH]
What gives?

51
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,250
[TONTO]
That's enough outta you two.

52
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:48,000
[DOLUGH] So do you think
Misuzu's a spy, Chuta?

53
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,750
No, absolutely not!

54
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,625
[DOLUGH] Even though she
was caught on camera?

55
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,708
Even so, I still trust Sonokata.

56
00:03:56,791 --> 00:04:00,291
Uh, for the same reason
that Chips does.

57
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,791
Yeah, but unlike Chips,

58
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,875
you haven't known Misuzu for
very long, have you, Chuta?

59
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,458
Well, uh, yeah, but--

60
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,333
Say, you're really being pushy.

61
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,750
Do you want Sonokata
to be found guilty?

62
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,125
Gosh, no!

63
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,041
I just wanna know why you're
so eager to trust her,

64
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,875
even if it means averting
your eyes from the truth.

65
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,166
I am not averting my
eyes from the truth.

66
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,333
[SUBORDINATE C] Next up
to the interrogation room.

67
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,916
Yes, sir.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,250
[SUBORDINATE A] She's developed
a fever over the past two hours.

69
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,208
I'm afraid the cause of
it is still unknown.

70
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,291
[BELALUGO] Well, fix it!
And straighten her up!

71
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,583
What do you want, huh?

72
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,541
Investigator Belalugo
is busy right now.

73
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,833
Then I'll just wait
here till he's done.

74
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:52,500
If words aren't enough
to get through to you--

75
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,583
[growling]

76
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,250
You little--

77
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,208
[growling]

78
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,583
You leave me no choice.

79
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,041
Ouch! That one's tough.

80
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,250
[door opens]

81
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,416
[BELALUGO grunts]

82
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,083
Well, it's Laine Brick.

83
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,416
One of your charming henchmen
tried to get rid of me

84
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,083
by threatening to use force,

85
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,791
so sadly I had to
resort to self-defense.

86
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,083
And if you don't believe me,
then by all means,

87
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:26,250
check the special camera
footage that you're so fond of.

88
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,083
What do you want, Brick?

89
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,333
[LAINE]
As chief of this Bureau,

90
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:32,208
I request an interview
with Officer Sonokata.

91
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,541
Request denied!

92
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,250
I'm under no obligation
to let you see her.

93
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,083
Hmph. Good day.

94
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:41,583
I'm guessing Misuzu
has a high fever by now.

95
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,458
And if a suspect becomes
ill during interrogation,

96
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,000
they should be allowed
to have access

97
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,708
to their personal physician.

98
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,416
Personal physician?

99
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,208
But you know the rules, Brick.

100
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:55,000
It's only reserved for sick
people who are above Level 50.

101
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:59,166
Yes, and Misuzu is one that
falls into that category.

102
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,083
She's a test subject in
the Taklamakan Project.

103
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,958
I think you know
what that means.

104
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,083
You're serious?

105
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,541
So you'll allow me to send
in her personal physician

106
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,208
and an assistant to treat her?

107
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,583
[BELALUGO grunts]

108
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:16,708
Very well. However, I won't
be going easy on her.

109
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,916
[TONTO]
Chief!

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,791
There's an emergency message for
you from Superintendent Kieshi.

111
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:28,208
Copy. Be right there.

112
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,333
[DALI] So that's the only
conversation you had

113
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,541
with Officer Sonokata
while the two of you

114
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,125
were at the detention center?

115
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,666
[CHUTA]
Yeah.

116
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,000
And you swear that everything
you've said to me here today

117
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:38,916
is the truth?

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,500
[CHUTA]
Again with the "truth."

119
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:44,208
Sheesh, everyone keeps going on
and on about "the truth."

120
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:47,375
Even Dolugh accused me of
ignoring the truth earlier.

121
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,125
[DOLUGH]
Chuta, he's asking a question.

122
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,208
Uh.

123
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,750
[DALI] Look into my eyes
and answer me!

124
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,000
[CHUTA screams]

125
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,666
Yes. Yes, sir!

126
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,916
[DALI]
All right, then. Next.

127
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,458
[sighs]

128
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,708
[DOLUGH] Wow. You were really
lost in thought earlier.

129
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,583
[CHUTA] Yeah and it was
your fault for askin' me

130
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,458
all about Sonokata right
before that interrogation.

131
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:10,083
Uh?

132
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,125
[BOTH yelp]

133
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,958
[VERONICA]
Hey, watch it!

134
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,000
What's wrong with you? You
could've broken my horn off!

135
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,583
Your horn?

136
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,708
And hey, wait a second, you're
the one who bumped into me here.

137
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,041
[VERONICA]
Well, I don't remember

138
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,125
because I'm a little out
of it from just waking up!

139
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,708
[CHUTA] What? She's making it
sound like that's my fault!

140
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:28,833
[NINOTCHKA]
Please forgive her.

141
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,125
She's suffering from jetlag.

142
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,333
Are you all right there?

143
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,583
Oh, I'm okay, really.
But thank you.

144
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:44,333
[CHUTA] Hmm, both of those
girls look to be about my age.

145
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,750
[ISAAC]
Chuta!

146
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:46,916
You got a second?

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,708
Uh, sure.

148
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,375
Wait, this is...

149
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,333
[CHUTA] I still don't
believe that Sonokata

150
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,958
let that Dragline guy
escape the other day.

151
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,166
No matter what anyone says.

152
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,791
Hurry up.

153
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:07,791
[CHUTA]
Sonokata!

154
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:08,958
Not good.

155
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,250
Her memories are beginning
to get muddled.

156
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,833
Hang in there, Misuzu.

157
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:17,083
What's going on with Sonokata?
Just what did they do to her?

158
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,125
[ISAAC]
They didn't do anything to her.

159
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,000
It's just her medicine
wearin' off.

160
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,291
[CHUTA]
Medicine?

161
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,458
You know.

162
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,125
Remember when Misuzu
came to get her kit

163
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,291
and talked about
how it helped her

164
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,291
adapt to the ship's environment?

165
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,125
[DOLUGH] Those were the pills
she got from sickbay.

166
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,791
Well, Misuzu doesn't know it,

167
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,875
but it's really a drug designed
to help manage the side effects

168
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,375
of a top-secret project.

169
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,708
Very hush-hush.

170
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,333
Side effects?

171
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,000
Chuta, what I'm
about to tell you

172
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:49,875
is somethin' that only the
chief, Chips, and I know about.

173
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:54,333
A while ago, Misuzu was forced
to undergo a medical procedure.

174
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,500
As a result of this, her body's
balance was destroyed

175
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,375
and she lost six months'
worth of memories.

176
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,625
[CHUTA]
What?

177
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,125
[ISAAC] An SPH-producing
organ was transplanted

178
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,083
from another individual
and put into Misuzu.

179
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,708
After that, her
personality changed.

180
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:13,125
This endeavor was known
as the Taklamakan Project.

181
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,750
But the entire project
ended in failure.

182
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,666
And most of those who
underwent the operation

183
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,916
either lost their lives or
had their bodies inflicted

184
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,916
with some sort of severe defect.

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,041
For her, that meant
losing all memory

186
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,666
related to the experiment.

187
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,750
And becoming unable to survive
without taking that medication

188
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,916
and now she's completely
dependent on it.

189
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,625
But why was she forced to
undergo something like that?

190
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:37,375
I don't have the answer to that.
'Cause it's top secret.

191
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,083
[CHUTA] So then why did
you tell me all this?

192
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,666
Why do you think?

193
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,333
I told you because you're now in
a position to protect Misuzu.

194
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:51,041
Protect... Sonokata?

195
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,583
Me?

196
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,166
The chief knows I was plannin'
to tell you all about this.

197
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,750
And he's onboard with it.

198
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,500
So now what?

199
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:04,333
Listen up, Second Division.
Got a mission for you.

200
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,208
This scientist is currently
residing on Earth.

201
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,416
I need you to bring
him back here.

202
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,833
Doctor Love.

203
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,541
One of the greatest scientists
in the whole universe.

204
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,666
Old acquaintance of mine.

205
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,916
He's 500 years old
and a total weirdo.

206
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,375
Five hundred?

207
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,958
Thing is, Doctor Love hates
people getting in his way,

208
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,333
so up till, now we've left
him alone without security.

209
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,750
But four of his
five body doubles

210
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,875
have turned up dead
in recent days.

211
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,500
[BOTH scream]

212
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,458
With things becoming
this dangerous,

213
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,375
can't maintain the status quo.

214
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:37,000
elDLIVE HQ ordered us to provide
protection for the doctor.

215
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,625
Uh, yeah, but, sir--

216
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,666
Right now I'm worried
about Misuzu, chu.

217
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,458
Are you worried, too?

218
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,166
Yes.

219
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,583
[LAINE] Don't let your personal
feelings get in the way!

220
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,416
Right! I'm sorry, sir!

221
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,458
Though I get what
you're going through.

222
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,625
I mean, ever since
Misuzu was arrested,

223
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,291
I've been binge-eating
dumplings.

224
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,666
[CHUTA grunts]

225
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,625
Now, this is completely
coincidental,

226
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,500
but as a bonus, this mission
could very well end up

227
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,500
being a way for us
to save Misuzu.

228
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,916
[BOTH]
Huh?

229
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,291
Ah, of course.

230
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,500
You see, Doctor Love's
full name is...

231
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:12,416
...Doctor Taklamakan
Strangelove.

232
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,791
He's the one who conceived
of the Taklamakan Project

233
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,583
I was telling you about earlier.

234
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,583
Yeah, okay, but what
does all that have to do

235
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,208
with saving Misuzu, chu?

236
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,250
[LAINE] Doctor Isaac and
I think the activity

237
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,833
that led to Misuzu
being accused of spying

238
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,666
might've been caused
by a side effect

239
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,958
of the medicine she's taking.

240
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,375
It's unconfirmed,
but similar incidents

241
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,291
have been reported in the past.

242
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,041
Others who've taken
this medicine

243
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:39,166
have apparently done things
they don't remember doin'.

244
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,750
Doctor Love created
the medicine,

245
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,375
so if we can get him to testify

246
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,541
that Misuzu cutting through the
grid was a just side effect,

247
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,208
this'll be deemed an accident
and she can go free.

248
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,500
Oh, I get it, chu.

249
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,458
Uh, I don't think I
followed all of that.

250
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:52,625
[DOLUGH]
I did!

251
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,166
But if we bring
back Doctor Love,

252
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,791
then that'll help us save
Sonokata, right?

253
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,166
So you'll go?

254
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,250
[BOTH]
Yoyosa!

255
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,750
[LAINE] You'll be working
with the Fifth Division

256
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,000
on this mission.

257
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,916
I've already given the
details to their leader.

258
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,916
[CHIPS]
We got transferred upside down.

259
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,166
[CHUTA] He did it again.
Come on, Sheronimo!

260
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,416
I'll let him off
the hook this time

261
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,041
because I'm in a good mood, chu.

262
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,541
We just gotta bring
Doctor Love back

263
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,666
and Misuzu can be
declared innocent, chu!

264
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,333
Ha-ha! That's true.

265
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:22,625
You see, Dolugh? It turns
out I was right all along.

266
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,875
I told you Sonokata
wasn't a spy.

267
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,083
Oh, but I never
said that she was.

268
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,333
Huh?

269
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,291
I just wanted to know
why you trusted Misuzu

270
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,166
when you didn't have
anything to back it up.

271
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,125
Sheesh, you're still
going on about that?

272
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,833
[CHIPS] Hey, I wanna be part of
this conversation, too, chu!

273
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:40,208
But I can't hear the
Monitalien! No fair, chu!

274
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,958
[BOTH grunt]

275
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,000
Freeze right there!

276
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:43,916
Don't move.

277
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,416
Hey, what're you doing?

278
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,041
[VERONICA]
Oh, it's you guys.

279
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,291
[NINOTCHKA]
Forgive our rude greeting,

00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,541

281
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,250
Oh, it's you!

282
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,333
We've been waiting here for you.

283
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,375
We're from Investigations
Division Five

284
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,958
and we'll be working with
you on this mission.

285
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,916
[ISAAC laughs]

286
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,875
Man, talk about
clever calculations.

287
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,208
Yes, but still...

288
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,750
What's the matter?

289
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,000
It's Misuzu's arrest and
Doctor Love's decoys.

290
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,166
The timing feels a
little too convenient.

291
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,291
[CHUTA gasps]

292
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,333
I ran into you after
my interrogation!

Yeah, yeah, well,
that was my bad, okay?

There, see, I apologized!
Now it's your turn!

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,208
So what're you waiting for?

arrested a C-rank

during his entrance exam.

Are you the Monitalien
everyone's talking about?

There are rumors?

Just dead weight.

475
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,000
Just dead weight?

476
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,916
Oh, that hurts me, too.

477
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,750
Now that's going too far.

478
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,166
He'll never learn if
I don't spell it out.

479
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,333
I'm dead weight?

480
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:11,000
Oh, no! Chuta's confidence
is melting away!

481
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:15,000
So you're all set
to escape now, huh?

482
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,458
[ALL gasp]

483
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,208
[IRWIN] It's him! I finally
get to meet the real deal!

484
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,333
[gasps]

485
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,208
[gasps]

486
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,250
[NINOTCHKA]
Oh, no!

487
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,500
[gasps]

488
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,375
[NINOTCHKA]
How awful!

489
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,666
[MAN]
So much noise.

490
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,500
Someone's there!

491
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:57,041
You need the old geezer
for something?

492
00:21:57,125 --> 00:22:01,458
Sorry, but... you
should've come sooner.

493
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,375
[CHUTA]
Oh, Inspector Veronica.

494
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,708
[VERONICA] What am I gonna do?
I made a mess in my sleep again.

495
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:37,958
[CHUTA]
Wait, you wet the bed?

496
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,500
[VERONICA]
As if!

497
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,625
No, my horn tore a hole in the
mattress when I rolled over!

498
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,166
[DOLUGH]
Next time on <i>elDLIVE</i> :

499
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,166
"Something to Believe
In: Part Two."

500
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,958
[CHUTA]
Way to be misleading!
