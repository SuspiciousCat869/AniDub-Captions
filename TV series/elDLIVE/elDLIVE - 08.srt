This time, I'm getting
rid of you for good!

00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,791
[DOLUGH]
Look out, Chuta!

3
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:21,291
They vanished?

00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:22,416
[CHUTA yelps]

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,333
What's happening?

6
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:25,083
Look, your shoulders.

7
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,208
Huh?

8
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:28,958
Whoa, wings?

9
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,083
This is sweet!

10
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,000
And we can move faster now!

11
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,916
Yes, ordinarily when a
Monitalien switches hosts,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,041
its evolved abilities would
reset back to normal.

13
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,625
But if it goes back to
its old host instead,

14
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,791
the enhanced abilities remain.

15
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:51,458
This phenomenon is called
Monitalien's Update.

16
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,375
Full disclosure, I'm the one
who came up with that name.

17
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,625
So this is the update?

18
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,708
We can do this!

19
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,000
[VERONICA]
Chief Laine!

20
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,541
What is it?

21
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,791
Can you tell me what the rookie
from Division Two is like?

22
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,208
[LAINE]
Chuta?

23
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,500
Why not find out for yourself
on this joint mission?

24
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,833
Yeah, but I wanna hear
your opinion, Chief.

25
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,375
Well, let's see.

26
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:22,333
My guess is he wouldn't impress
you no matter what he does.

27
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,333
Even if he's able to
secure Doctor Love

28
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,458
without any problems at all,

29
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:29,125
you wouldn't appreciate
him as an officer or a man.

30
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,208
Well, that doesn't
sound too promising.

31
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,125
[LAINE]
However...

32
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,500
If you guys run into
some serious trouble,

33
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:38,666
I think you'll find his
core to be truly reliable.

34
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,375
His core?

35
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,375
I think I might understand

36
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:48,833
what the chief was
trying to... to say now.

37
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,708
We're able to move so fast now!

38
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,250
It's like her attacks
are barely moving.

39
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,291
[chuckles]

40
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:33,250
So are you just
gonna keep fleeing?

41
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,708
We can't just keep
running away.

42
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:37,875
Apparently.

43
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,958
[CHUTA yells]

44
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,083
[DOLUGH] Sewing up won't
work here, Chuta.

45
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,666
Yeah, I know that.

46
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,625
Still, there's gotta
be some way.

47
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,750
I was so scared of
her SPH earlier,

48
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,875
but now, I am not scared at all!

49
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,583
Yeah, I agree.

50
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,791
Hey, Chuta.

51
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,458
In a way, don't you think
Ninotchka's attack

52
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,416
looks like some kinda vegetable?

53
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,666
You think?

54
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,916
[NINOTCHKA]
You may be a little faster now,

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,083
but you're still every bit
as weak as before!

56
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,041
Hey, whaddya know,
you're right.

57
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,125
They really do
look like veggies.

58
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:15,041
Almost like green onions!

59
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,500
[DOLUGH]

No, he can't!

Impossible!

63
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,625
I can't believe he was
able to foil my plan.

64
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,083
Well, I have no use
for this girl anymore.

65
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,875
I'll make her bite
her tongue off!

66
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:42,750
[gasps]

67
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,958
That won't be happening.

68
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,500
Officer Ninotchka?

69
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,875
I extracted the remote
control SPH from her

70
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,750
using this fixed
SPH remover beam.

71
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,083
She'll be fine.
No major injuries.

72
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,333
[sighs]

73
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:09,291
[CHUTA]
So she's back to normal.

74
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,750
Thank goodness.

75
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,166
Hey, wait a second.
What about the others?

76
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,416
I already treated the blue
shrimp and the Kushutonian girl,

77
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,250
so they're both fine, too.

78
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,583
Wait, when did you...?

79
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,000
There are all sorts of
medical supplies here,

80
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:26,000
behind the walls and under
the floor of this facility.

81
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,791
If we hadn't been here,
she never would've survived.

82
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,541
Inspector Veronica.

83
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,500
For the record,
I didn't undress her.

84
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,208
Yeah, I know that!

85
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,666
Oh, that's right,
I still need to go

86
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,041
and patch up the
long-haired girl, too.

87
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,291
[DOLUGH] If Doctor Love weren't
here, Veronica would've died.

88
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,958
He seems like a good guy.

89
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,916
Yeah, we all owe him
our lives, although...

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,458
...I think there's something
a little off about him.

91
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,791
[LOVE]
By the way,

92
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,250
when I measured the levels
of the remote control SPH

93
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,750
that she had in her body,

94
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,791
I found that she must've
come into contact with

95
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,583
and absorbed it two hours ago.

96
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,000
Any idea how?

97
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,958
Huh? Wait, two hours ago?

98
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,666
But we hadn't even left
the Jeanrenoi-R yet.

99
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,833
Huh?

100
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,333
Does that mean that
whoever infected her

101
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,750
was somewhere within the Bureau?

102
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,500
Well, to use the remote
control SPH on someone,

103
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,500
you do have to come in
contact with a person

104
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,416
and then really
concentrate on them.

105
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,875
But how could they?

106
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,791
[LOVE] There's also the
matter of compatibility,

107
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,583
so not everyone who
was subjected to it

108
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,208
will be controlled.

109
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,500
Which means there's
a possibility

110
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,083
it was used on you, too,
but without any effect.

111
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,416
What? Really?

112
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,791
There are several ways
that it could've happened.

113
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,208
For example, being forced to
look someone in the eyes

114
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,916
at close range for a while.

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,125
Look someone in the
eyes for a while?

116

[BOTH scream]

117
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:43,625
Could it've been...
Belalugo's interrogator?

118
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:47,166
So it was when Ninotchka was
being interviewed, huh?

119
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,083
Who would've thought the
interrogator was the bad guy?

120
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,416
Quick, we have to
alert Chief Laine!

121

00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,541
straight to Hell.

163
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,625
McClane?

164
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,791
Dali's going to control all
the personnel in the Bureau!

165
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:49,750
And then he'll kill
everybody off, one by one!

166
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,125
[CHUTA yells]

167
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,458
[DOLUGH] You're the only one
upside down this time.

168
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:53,791
[CHUTA]
Why me?

169
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,500
I corrected the transfer
algorithm before we left,

170
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,500
but apparently I
forgot to fix yours.

171
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:00,500
There's trouble!

172
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,625
Some officers are
being controlled

173
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,625
and attacking others, shero!

174
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,875
[CHUTA]
What?

175
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,166
They say they're going
to kill everyone, shero!

176
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,916
Eh, they're just bluffing.

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,250
Huh?

178
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,750
Only five percent of those
who've been subjected

179
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,333
to the remote control SPH
are actually susceptible

180
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,875
to its influence.

181
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,291
There's no way they can kill
everyone with just that many.

182
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,541
So then--

183
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,083
Whoever's behind this
has an ulterior motive.

184
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,541
[CHUTA]
But what?

185
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,333
Through his proxies,
the culprit said he wanted

186
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,166
to open the gate to some
treasure with my brain?

187
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,458
I'm afraid right now he's trying
to get ahold of that very gate.

188
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,916
[CHUTA]
A gate?

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,708
Doctor Love, what the
heck is this gate?

190
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,958
[LOVE]
Tell me, have you ever heard

191
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,458
of the Taklamakan Project?

192
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,541
[gasps]

193
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:46,125
[LOVE] We have to hurry.
She's in danger.

194
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,458
[RIGGS] Chief, more personnel
have been brainwashed.

195
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,000
All of the squads are
currently dealing with

196
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:53,125
at least one member who's
under Dali's control.

197
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:56,041
[LAINE] He's controlling people
indiscriminately now.

198
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,125
What's he up to?

199
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,708
Uh, Chief.

200
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,708
A door's just been opened using
the investigator's authority.

201
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,083
It's located inside
the detention center.

202
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,291
Detention?

203
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,958
[LAINE] Based on what
McClane said earlier,

204
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,916
I'm guessing Dali
already killed Belalugo.

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,666
So he must've stolen the
investigator's authority.

206
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,666
Could his real goal be to--?

207
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,916
If so, then the timing of all of
this would make total sense!

208
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,125
Riggs, Which squad's
closest to detention?

209
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,583
Looks like Squad Three.

210
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,541
They're fighting in
Hall 72 right now.

211
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,958
From their location,

212
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,375
even the fastest route
would take ten minutes.

213
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:33,083
[LAINE] Damn it!
He's really got us here.

214
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,291
[TONTO]
Chief!

215
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,666
All right, it's time to go.

216
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,208
At last, Great Gate
to the Treasure,

217
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,250
we're finally able to
be alone together.

218
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,375
[DALI] I was going to have
Doctor Love open the gate

219
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,333
using his medical expertise,

220
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,416
but then that
precocious little brat

221
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,458
had to go and get in the way.

222
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,791
Nevertheless, I will
open up this gate,

223
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,458
no matter what it takes.

224
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,833
Which means unleashing
those memories of yours

225
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:03,208
that have been so
securely locked away.

226
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,541
Not to worry.

227
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,291
Doctor Love isn't the only
scientist around here.

228
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,208
Even if I have to
overmedicate you

229
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,333
or chop up your brain
into tiny little pieces,

230
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,541
I'll get what I'm after!

231
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,750
Leave Sonokata alone!

321
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,750
It's too dangerous for
you there, Doctor.

322
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,000
It's a matter of time
before someone else comes

323
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,916
and tries to access Misuzu
Sonokata's memories.

324
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,916
[LOVE] How much longer are you
going to keep up that farce?

325
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,833
I've told you on more
than one occasion

326
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,750
that I can fully restore
Sonokata to a healthy state

327
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,125
and return all of
her memories to her.

328
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,000
The ones who insist on her
remaining a Level 50 patient

329
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,666
are you people.

330
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,625
That isn't our decision
to make. It's Mothers'.

331
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,208
[LOVE] I have no desire
to go against Mothers.

332
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,750
All I'm saying is
that it's safer

333
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,791
if I stay by the girl's side.

334
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:47,166
I know more about Sonokata's
body than anyone else.

335
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,708
For instance, you
probably aren't aware

336
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,458
of the small but
important effect

337
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:56,333
Chuta Kokonose has had on
her condition recently.

338
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,625
Wait, Chuta?

339
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,916
[LOVE]
Despite his bland looks,

340
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,583
Kokonose is actually
quite interesting.

341
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,000
I've become convinced that
there must be some reason

342
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,708
that Dolugh needs him.

343
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,125
Very well.

344
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,375
Chief Laine, please, take good
care of Doctor Love now.

345
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,583
Uh, Yoyosa!

346
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,083
[KIESHI]
And assign him some bodyguards.

347
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:18,916
[LOVE] You mean people
to monitor me, correct?

348
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,583
Come on! Get outta the way!

349
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,458
[DOLUGH]
A lot of people got hurt.

350
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,291
I really wanna ask Doctor
Isaac how Inspector Veronica

351
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,500
and Officer Ninotchka
are doing, but--

352
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,375
[DOLUGH] Looks like they're
pretty busy right now.

353
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,541
[MISUZU]
I heard that both of them

354
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,916
have regained consciousness.

355
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,833
[CHUTA]
Sonokata.

356
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,416
Apparently, it was
thanks to Doctor Love.

357
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,166
They're both asleep right now.

358
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,500
That's great. Thank goodness.

359
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,000
[DOLUGH]
Be careful, Chuta.

360
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,041
Misuzu doesn't know
that she's a subject

361
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:49,541
in the Taklamakan Project,
or that she was the target here.

362
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,250
Well, at first glance,

363
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,666
it appears that Dali Lime was
plotting this whole time,

364
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,791
trying to find a way he
could use Doctor Love

365
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,708
to unseal Misuzu's memories.

366
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,666
Right around then,
he caught a lucky break

367
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,041
when she let that prisoner out

368
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,041
due to side effects
from her medicine.

369
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,958
So then Dali found
out about that

370
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,791
and put his plan into action.

371
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,416
Now, officially, this
has been filed away

372
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,125
as just attempted
ransom and espionage.

373
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,375
You and I are the only
people here in the Bureau

374
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:18,958
who know the real story.

375
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:22,458
Don't tell anyone. Got it?
Especially Misuzu.

376
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,958
Yeah, but, Chief,
what are these memories?

377
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,875
Why did Dali want them?

378
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:31,750
Sorry, but that's
top secret, kid.

379
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,250
[CHUTA]
In the end,

380
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,583
guess there's still a whole
lot of things I don't know.

381
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:43,125
But Sonokata's standing here.
And that's good enough for now.

382
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,625
Uh, hey.

383
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,958
Guess you did a pretty good job
with securing Doctor Love.

384
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,500
[CHUTA]
Thanks.

385
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,083
Sorry if I caused you trouble
being suspected of spying.

386
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,791
[CHUTA]
Don't worry about it!

387
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,375
Oh, by the way,

388
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,375
I heard that the
Monitalien was updated.

389
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,583
Yeah, that's right.

390
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,958
He even looks a little
different now, too.

391
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,500
Uh, you're getting
awfully close.

392
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,041
See, look right here!
You see? Check 'em out!

393
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,166
Hope you'll get an
update soon, too.

394
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,250
Frankly, you could use
one a whole lot more

395
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,541
than the Monitalien.

396
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,625
[CHUTA groans]

397
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,166
[growls]

398
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,833
After I just risked my life
fighting to try and save her!

399
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:18,958
Hold up!

400
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:19,958
What is it?

401
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,041
You! And your attitude!

402
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,250
Why are you so testy
with me all the time?

403
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,833
I'll be more careful now.

404
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,166
Is that what you want?

405
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,166
No, not at all! You got
something to say, say it!

406
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,666
[MISUZU]
Then I'll be honest with you.

407
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,708
[MISUZU]
It's your SPH.

408
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,375
Compared to how it was before...

409
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,458
...it's stinky.

410
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:55,208
[MISUZU]
Stinky, stinky, stinky, stinky.

411
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,791
[MISUZU]
Excuse me.

412
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:01,166
There's no way.
She thinks I...

413
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,333
I smell bad?!

414
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,541
[MIMI]
Have a good day!

415
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,041
[CHUTA]
See ya later.

416
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:13,958
[MIMI] I love you, Chuta!
Watch out for cars now, okay?

417
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,916
Oh, Chuta, what's
going on with you?

418
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,291
He was in the bath for
over an hour yesterday.

419
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,750
And then he used my perfume
without even asking me.

420
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:28,000
Jeez, I wonder if all boys are
like this when they hit puberty.

421
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,625
[CHIPS]
Morning, chu!

422
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,208
[MISUZU]
Good morning.

423
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,083
Uh. Good morning.

424
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,458
So, uh, there a special reason

425
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,583
why we're meeting at Earth's
local branch today?

426
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,833
There's something
we have to do, chu.

427
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,583
I'm picking up a
very strong odor

428
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,791
coming from Officer
Kokonose, chu.

429
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,125
[MISUZU] It's a perfume
that Earthlings use.

430
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,375
Lady Earthlings.

431
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,250
[grunts]

432
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,666
[DOLUGH]
She figured you out.

433
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,500
Uh, hey, so, Inspector Chips,
just outta curiosity,

434
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,541
has the smell of my SPH changed?

435
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,791
[CHIPS]
Uh?

436
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,250
Your SPH smells the same
as it always does, chu.

437
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,083
[MISUZU clears throat]

438
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,416
[MISUZU] I must've been
mistaken the other day.

439
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,750
Please, don't let it
bother you. I'm sorry.

440
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:12,041
Mistaken? So then,
you mean I don't stink?

441
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,333
No.

442
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,625
Hey, wait, you're
wearing nose plugs!

443
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,166
They're not nose plugs.

444
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,166
They're nose accessories that
Tykwerians use for rituals.

445
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,250
[CHUTA] But your nose
is still plugged up!

446
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,875
[DOLUGH]
Chuta, look!

447
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,333
Oh, they're here, chu!

448
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,208
[CHUTA]
Huh?

449
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,500
Hey.

450
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,333
Good, I can finally thank
you, Chuta Kokonose.

451
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,250
Yes, thanks for coming to
our rescue the other day!

452
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,958
Uh, what are you
guys doing here?

453
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,041
And why are you wearing
my school's uniform?

454
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,125
We're all part of the team
that's gonna be working

455
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,000
from the same local
branch on Earth, chu.

456
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,541
[CHUTA]
Really?

457
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,125
[CHIPS] Doctor Love will be our
scientific research expert.

458
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,708
And he'll also be able to
keep us all healthy, chu.

459
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,416
Meanwhile, Investigation
Division Five

460
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,166
is in charge of guarding
Doctor Love, chu.

461
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,333
Guarding him?

462
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,666
Yeah, we're here to
keep an eye on him.

463
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,083
That's right.

464
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,375
Doctor Love's a very important
scientist, after all.

465
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,083
Well, you heard the girl.

466
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,375
Looking forward to
working with you.

467
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,916
I don't believe we've met.

468
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,708
Officer Sonokata.

469
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,833
Uh, it's nice to meet you.

470
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:12,833
[CHUTA]
Huh?

471
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,416
Oh, right.

472
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,375
She doesn't remember anything
about the Taklamakan project,

473
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,625
so for her, this is their
first time meeting.

474
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,208
If Sonokata and Doctor Love

475
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,916
are going to the same
school together now...

476
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,375
All of the students have
gone home for the day.

477
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,375
[MISUZU]
Oh. Yes, Doctor Love.

478
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:33,125
Now, it's time to begin
today's Taklamakan Project.

479
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,291
Oh, yes, Doctor Love.

480
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,708
So take off your clothes.

481
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,625
Oh, yes, Doctor Love.

482
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,625
[CHUTA]
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

483
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,500
[DOLUGH] Oh, yeah, I'm pretty
sure that's not gonna happen.

484
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,875
I detect something's wrong.

485
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,083
Is he okay?

486
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,250
He's probably just
a little tired.

487
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,000
No, this is normal for him.

488
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,541
All of us going to
the same school?

489
00:21:54,625 --> 00:22:00,166
What's gonna happen now?!

490
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,833
[CHUTA]
You're so fancy, Doctor Love.

491
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:36,708
[LOVE]
Perhaps, but I'm only interested

492
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,958
in the body's structure
and organs.

493
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,791
I wanna touch raw flesh.
Ninotchka, undress for me.

494
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,291
[NINOTCHKA gasps]

495
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,875
[DOLUGH] Next time on
<i>elDLIVE</i> : "Misuzu's Lie."

496
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,791
[CHUTA]
Wow, that's pretty raw!
