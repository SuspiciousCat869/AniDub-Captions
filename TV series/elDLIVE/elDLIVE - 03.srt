1
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:10,458
[MAN A] You got a plan
to move the goods?

2
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:13,250
[MAN B] Piece-a-cake.
What about yours?

3
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:16,083
[MAN A]
Here, I'll show it to ya.

4
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:18,291
[MAN B]
Uh! You bastard.

5
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:19,958
[MAN A]
Damn right.

6
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,333
[KIESHI] I'm sure you already
know why you're here.

7
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,583
It's about Drago Bureau.

8
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:01,416
They boarded a smuggling ship
headed toward your solar system

9
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,916
and found a body
and this symbol.

10
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,041
I've seen that mark before!

11
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,958
[ISAAC]
That's everything.

12
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,333
Doctor Isaac, I have a question.

13
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,666
So far I've got
handcuffs, this badge,

14
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,750
and I assume a snazzy
uniform's coming,

15
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,583
but shouldn't I
also get a weapon?

16
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:21,666
[ISAAC]
Hm?

17
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,625
What kinda weapon
you have in mind?

18
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,875
A gun or a whistle or something.

19
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,458
Giving you either of
those would be a waste.

20
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,666
[CHUTA]
Huh?

21
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,375
Space criminals possess
abilities far beyond

22
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,375
what normal Earth science
is able to comprehend.

23
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,208
In order to beat them requires
a special kind of power.

24
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,458
The reason you were
chosen to join elDLIVE

25
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,500
is because you showed an ability
to harness just such a power

26
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,500
during your qualifying exam.

27
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,916
Guess we did.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,875
I was quite surprised myself.

29
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,541
It was a remarkable performance.

30
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,958
Yeah, I guess so.

31
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,875
I feel you getting confident,
Chuta, and I like it.

32
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,208
Whoa, dude, that
sounds so creepy!

33
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:01,833
So, Doc, what's the secret to
making this special power work?

34
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,416
[ISAAC]
Body odor.

35
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,333
'Course, the clinical
term we use is SPH.

36
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,333
It's short for
"space pheromones."

37
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,375
So Dolugh's attack's
based on his odor?

38
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,666
[ISAAC]
Earthling's can't smell it,

39
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,166
but SPH can be used for
all kinds of attacks.

40
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,500
Whoa, that means when we had
that escapee the other day,

41
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:24,125
Sonokata defeated him
by using her body odor?

42
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:27,000
Please refrain from
being a pervert at work.

43
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,750
Oh, good! Misuzu

44
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,708
I take it that my kit's
all ready, Doctor?

45
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:34,041
Yes, yours is in the upper right
shelf with the red capsules.

46
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,125
Thanks.

47
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,666
What's wrong?
Sonokata, are you sick?

48
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,000
[MISUZU]
No.

49
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,125
The pills help me adapt to
the ship's environment.

50
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,833
[CHUTA gasping]

51
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,125
[DOLUGH] Seeing panties makes
Chuta's heart beat fast!

52
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,541
Hey! Don't say that!
I didn't see panties!

53
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,500
[gasps]

54
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,125
[MISUZU growls]

55
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,333
[MISUZU]
Pervert!

56
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,750
Hey! Over here, you guys!

57
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:00,708
[DOLUGH]
Chuta, you've been getting

58
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,958
so much more assertive, lately.

59
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,541
[DOLUGH] All the people
complimenting you

60
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,833
has done wonders
for your confidence.

61
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,333
Wow. You think so?

62
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,750
[TATEYAN]
Chuta, head's up!

63
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:12,958
Wha--?

64
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,541
[CHUTA]
Crap!

65
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,000
[DOLUGH]
Sympathy!

66
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,791
[whistle blows]

67
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:32,291
[CHUTA]
Dolugh! What if they saw you?

68
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,666
[STUDENT A]
Nice goal, Chuta!

69
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,458
[STUDENT B] Yeah, dude!
You got a cannon for a leg!

70
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,208
[STUDENT C]
Awesome!

71
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,416
Uh, thanks, guys.

72
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,125
[DOLUGH]
Chuta, you're so happy!

73
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,041
Heck yeah, I'm happy!
That goal was super cool!

74
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,416
[DOLUGH]
Yeah, and now you're talking

75
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,041
to more and more kids at school.

76
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,625
Yep!

77
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,125
People wanna be your friend when
you've got mad soccer skills!

78
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,875
Help! Thief! Someone,
catch that shoplifter!

79
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,625
[CHUTA]
Freeze, creep!

80
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,083
Dolugh! This guy should
be easy to sew up!

81
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,583
Sew him up!

82
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,625
[DOLUGH]
He shattered?

83
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,291
[screams]

84
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,250
[gasps]

85
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,875
[CHUTA]
Aunt Mimi! Are you okay?

86
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,250
Mimi, wake up! Wake up!

87
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,708
[DOLUGH] Shouldn't you be
looking after Aunt Mimi, Chuta?

88
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:40,083
[CHUTA] Once again someone got
hurt, and it's all my fault.

89
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:43,625
It's best if I don't
do anything at all.

90
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:44,541
Chuta.

91
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:45,666
[CHUTA gasps]

92
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,291
Dolugh, you're fading.

93
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,791
If you start thinking
bad things about yourself,

94
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:55,500
you'll be denying my existence,
and my body'll fade away.

95
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,375
[footsteps]

96
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,708
[MISUZU] You are not supposed
to use your SPH powers

97
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:00,875
in every day life.

98
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,458
It's against elDLIVE regulation.

99
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,625
Sonokata.

100
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,458
You see, that power
is not of the Earth.

101
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,208
It's too dangerous
to use haphazardly.

102
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,833
[CHUTA]
All right, I get it.

103
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:14,416
No, you don't. You only
understand a fraction of it.

104
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,833
[CHUTA]
Huh?

105
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,875
I took the liberty of cleaning
up your mess this time,

106
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:22,583
but if you do it again, the
punishment will be severe.

107
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,583
[DOLUGH]
Chuta, I can't help but notice

108
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,625
this is the meal you always
cook when you're depressed.

109
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:53,041
[CHUTA] I think...
I should quit elDLIVE.

110
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,416
[DOLUGH]
Don't be rash!

111
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,583
Chuta, becoming a space
policeman is the best thing

112
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,000
that's ever happened
to your confidence!

113
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,041
My confidence?

114
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,083
Mimi's hurt because
of my confidence!

115
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:07,250
Stupid! I shouldn't
have gotten involved!

116
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,958
[CHUTA] And after I swore I
wouldn't hurt anyone ever again,

117
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,458
I still managed to do it!

118
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,291
[DOLUGH]
Chuta! Red Alert!

119
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:23,500
I think you made too
much depression food!

120
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,875
[NURSE A]
Aw, how sweet of you.

121
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,583
You know It's still
visiting hours, though.

122
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,958
You can bring them to
her yourself if you want.

123
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,750
[CHUTA] Yeah, no, I think it'd
be better if you took it in.

124
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:34,791
Well, hey, you.

125
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:35,875
[CHUTA gasps]

126
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:39,166
Chuta, you finally came!

127
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,000
I still can't believe
one of the wall beams

128
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,708
was so old it fell down.

129
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:43,875
[CHUTA]
What?

130
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,500
That's weird. Her
memory's been changed.

131
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,458
Well, it could've
been worse, though.

132
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,666
it coulda hit my head
and knocked me silly!

133
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,541
No, wait, Aunt Mimi.
The truth is... that I--

134
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,125
Oh, Chuta, honey, what's wrong?

135
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,125
[CHUTA]
It would've been better...

136
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,500
...if I was the one
who got hurt, not you.

137
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,666
[gasps]

138
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,166
[MIMI]
Don't you dare say that!

139
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,125
I just meant, it'd be better
because you have to work.

140
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,250
Chuta, if you got hurt,
I wouldn't be able to sleep,

141
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,958
let alone bake muffins!

142
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,208
Watching you grow up

143
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,458
and waiting for you to
walk through the door

144
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,833
after school every day,

145
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,416
that is my whole
motivation for living!

146
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,625
It's only when you're doing
okay that I'm doing okay.

147
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:29,833
I'm... sorry, Auntie.

148
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,250
[MIMI]
Look at me.

149
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,041
I made myself cry with
my own little speech.

150
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,625
[CHUTA]
Don't cry.

151
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:39,541
Well, on the bright side, you've
been so much happier lately.

152
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,458
And confident, too.

153
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:42,541
[CHUTA]
Huh?

154
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:48,708
[DOLUGH] Mimi sees the changes
in you, just like I do.

155
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:55,375
[CHUTA] Sometimes I forget how
much she cares for me.

156
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,458
I have to be a stronger person.

157
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,916
It's the only way I'll
be able to protect her.

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,416
And her muffin shop!

159
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,125
Hey, look! Chuta,
I'm becoming solid again!

160
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,583
[CHIPS]
I see you, chu!

161
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,625
[CHUTA]
Huh? Sonokata?

162
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,708
It's time for our shift.

163
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,208
[CHUTA, MISUZU, CHIPS]
Yoyosa!

164
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,416
Nice salute.

165
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,416
Section Chief
Madigan's still out.

166
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,208
So until he's back, you
answer to me. You got that?

167
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,208
[CHUTA, MISUZU]
Yes, Chief!

168
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,833
Now, having said that,

169
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,625
I don't really have a
mission for your team

170
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,666
that matches your skill levels.

171
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,875
How 'bout you just
go study for school?

172
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,208
[CHUTA]
Huh?

173
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,166
Looks like we got
free time, chu.

174
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,583
Too bad.

175
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,333
I bet working on that case
would've been so fun, chu.

176
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,583
Um. Wait, which case?

177
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,083
[MISUZU]
You haven't heard?

178
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,708
Apparently, the thief you
blasted by your Auntie's shop

179
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:46,916
was an alien.

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,041
[gasps]

181
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,583
Then what are we
standing around here for?

182
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,125
We gotta arrest that jerk!

183
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,125
[MISUZU] I see that news
energized you. What's going on?

184
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,583
Well, he's a shoplifter.

185
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,041
And my auntie,

186
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,125
she can't run her store with
that crook still at large.

187
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,500
[CHIPS]
I don't like this.

188
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,500
It's not good to make an
investigation personal, chu.

189
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,000
What? Okay, I get it.

190
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,208
[MISUZU] No, Chips.
He's right this time.

191
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,791
Hold on, what?

192
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,291
[MISUZU]
We're not receiving good cases

193
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,500
because Kokonose's
rank is so low.

194
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,333
If we solve this,
he'll level up.

195
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,208
If we don't, chances
are he'll die.

196
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,958
Either outcome works for me.

197
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,375
[CHUTA]
What? Argh!

198
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,583
Forget it! I'll work this alone!

199
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,333
[MISUZU]
'Kay, good luck.

200
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,541
Oh, yeah, I'll arrest him.

201
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,208
Easy since I have no
idea where to start!

202
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,458
Chuta!

203
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,625
How did elDLIVE find out
the thief was an alien

204
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,166
in the first place?

205
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,250
I dunno.

206
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,791
They probably scanned the area

207
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,875
and noticed some difference
between him and humans.

208
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:47,708
Uh.

209
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,166
His SPH! That's gotta be it!

210
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,125
[MELIES]
Click here, and then double...

211
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,541
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Melies, sir?

212
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,708
[gasping]

213
00:10:56,916 --> 00:11:00,041
How dare you!

214
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,958
My true form must never
be seen by others!

215
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,250
Moon guy has arms and
they're super shredded!

216
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,708
I'll have you know the number
of people who've seen my arms

217
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,166
is only... 50 thousand!

218
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,250
That's actually quite
a lot of people.

219
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,833
Shut up, what do you want?

220
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:19,000
[CHUTA] Um, I'm trying to catch
a shoplifting alien on Earth,

221
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:22,083
and I was wondering if you
kept SPH records in here.

222
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,958
[MELIES] You're running
your own investigation?

223
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,958
That's some nerve!

224
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:29,625
That's right. You gonna
help me with this or not?

225
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,416
[MELIES] Hm, he has the
most of the leverage here

226
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,916
since he saw my arms.

227
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,500
Fine! Long as you don't gab
about my muslces, I'll help!

228
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,333
[CHUTA]
Muscles? What muscles?

229
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,666
[MELIES] Just like fingerprints
on you Earthlings,

230
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,875
the SPH signature on
aliens is always unique.

231
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,083
No two are alike!

232
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,291
[CHUTA]
Wow.

233
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,750
[MELIES] I'm searching
for any sign of SPH

234
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,791
recorded near your home at
the time of the shoplifting.

235
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:55,541
And then I'll cross-reference
that with our database.

236
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,833
[beep]

237
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,958
[MELIES]
We got a match! That's him!

238
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:02,541
Hey, uh, he's done a
lot more than shoplift.

239
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,541
[CHUTA]
Really? What'd you find?

240
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,375
[MELIES]
It's bad. Way bad.

241
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,625
[CHUTA]
Uh, Chief?

242
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,541
[LAINE]
Huh?

243
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,708
[CHUTA] The alien shop-lifter
from my street...

244
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,458
...did you also know
that he's a murderer?

245
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,416
It's not your case,
how do you know?

246
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,291
[CHUTA]
I kinda, just, uh...

247
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,250
Earlier I saw Officer Kokonose

248
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,125
go to the SPH Research
Office to see Melies.

249
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,625
You must have
something on Melies

250
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,208
in order to get him to help.

251
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,708
All right, enough.

252
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:44,166
I thought I told you
guys to just go study.

253
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,458
And like I said: We're already
investigating that case.

254
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:51,541
I know. But can you let me
be a part of it, as well?

255
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,000
[LAINE]
Why are you so hung up on this?

256
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,791
I guess it's just--

257
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,375
Well, I think I have
do it to protect my--

258
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,958
[DOLUGH]
Chuta!

259
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,083
You were warned not to bring
your personal life into the job!

260
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,541
Right. I know.

261
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,541
Um, well, Chief,
it's just that...

262
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,916
...I'm worried if we don't catch

263
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,666
this murderous
shoplifting alien,

264
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,291
then people on that street

265
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,125
won't be able to live
their lives in peace.

266
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,000
And if he rips off any more
of them, well that's...

267
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,458
...even more tragic than when
the rice for your curry

268
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:17,875
comes out too mushy!

269
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:18,750
[LAINE]
Uh.

270
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,583
[ALL]
Uh?

271
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,916
[HARRY]
That's the worst thing you know?

272
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,625
[ALL laughing]

273
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,541
All right, bring in the culpret.

274
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,291
You made your case, Chuta!

275
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,833
Wait, Chief, are you sure?

276
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,583
I thought this crook
was a special case

277
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,583
and you had plans to mark him?

278
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,916
That's our Chief for ya.
Always shootin' from the hip.

279
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,791
[LAINE]
The suspect: Gumshoe Alien Jim.

280
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,750
He's wanted on charges
of larceny and murder.

281
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,333
Judging from the murder scene,

282
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,250
he killed his partner in a
meeting they were having

283
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,125
about how to ship their
stolen goods off the planet.

284
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,708
So tell me, what did
the criminals take?

285
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,375
They stole bubblegum.

286
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,833
He steals bubblegum?

287
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:04,666
Gumshoe Alien Jim's bodily
form is similar to bubblegum.

288
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,166
For his race, it has certain
medicinal properties.

289
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,708
He killed someone... for gum.

290
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,958
Well, they don't have it
on the Gumshoe planet.

291
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:18,458
A short supply plus high demand
creates a lure of easy money

292
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,750
that pushes already
bad guys to murder.

293
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,791
Any leads on where he might be?

294
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,916
[LAINE]
Yes. One.

295
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,208
[CHIPS]
He drives a yellow truck, chu?

296
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,500
[LAINE] Right, intel
assumes he's driving it

297
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,250
to haul around his
stolen bubblegum.

298
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,250
[MELIES]
Hm.

299
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,625
The alien's SPH
signature is weak!

300
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:39,791
I can't find...

301
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,333
Huh. Looks like his
arms are gone again.

302
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:44,500
I also can't seem to locate
him on satellite either.

303
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,500
He's driving a big yellow truck.

304
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,666
Shouldn't we just be
looking for that?

305
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,333
Hey! I see something in
the truck's windshield!

306
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,500
[CHUTA]
The reflection.

307
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,583
Mount Fuji?

308
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,375
[ALL gasp]

309
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,125
[MELIES] By analyzing
the angle of the sun

310
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,666
casting Mount Fuji's reflection,

311
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,416
I can calculate the truck's
position on Earth.

312
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,875
Bingo! It's Tomei Highway!

313
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,541

He always messes up, chu!

315
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:14,416
Do you see the truck?
It should be right here.

316
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,666
Hey, where you going?

317
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,416
It'd be best for our search
if you just stay here.

318
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,708
In fact, sit out the
investigation altogether.

319
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,125
What?

320
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,375
Bye.

321
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,541
Chuta! I smell bubblegum!

322
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,291
It's coming from
there! Smell it?

323
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,500
[CHUTA]
It's a truckstop. They sell gum.

324
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,166
Yes, but this scent is
Snap-Snap bubblegum!

325
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,541
They only sell that at candy
shops like the one on my street.

326
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,416
I think we found him!

327
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,291
This is elDLIVE!

328
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:51,166
Gumshoe Alien Jim, come
out with your hands up!

329
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,208
How has he managed to
hide a giant yellow truck?

330
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,833
[BOTH yelp]

331
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,083
Owie, that hurt.

332
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,541
Oh, good gravy.

333
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,125
[JIM] You may have found me,
but you won't bring me in!

334
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,375
[DOLUGH]
Chuta! It's the yellow truck!

335
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,708
[CHUTA] Which means our
suspect... is this puny alien!

336
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,833
Hey, you bumped into
me on the street!

337
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,833
It's because of you
blasting my body suit

338
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,166
I can't be big no more!

339
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,333
I'm gonna kill you
dead, elDLIVE!

[CHUTA laughs]

341
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,833
This guy must be the smallest
murderer in history!

342

I'm with the Space
Police elDLIVE!

343
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,541
You have the right
to remain silent.

You have the right to an-- Ah!

345
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,916
[JIM] Ha-ha! Warned you not
to mess with me, space pig!

346
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,791
Oh, that's it!

00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,083
[CHUTA yells]

348
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,291
[JIM] Nice kick!
Your grandma teach you?

349
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,833
What is that thing?

350
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,875
[MISUZU]
That's SPH.

351

[CHUTA]
Sonokata.

352
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:47,750
Normal physical attacks have no
effect on a suspect using SPH.

[screams]

354

[CHUTA]
Her SPH.

355
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,625
That's one powerful body odor.

356
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,583
When you say it like
that, it's gross.

357
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,416
You're right. Quiet now.

358
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,291
Chuta! The suspect's gone!

359

Oh, no!

have gotten far, chu!

Here's what ya get for
messing with Gumshoe Jim:

365
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,166
A smothered partner!

366
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,291
He's using his SPH to
stick to her super tight.

367
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,958
I can't get an attack in
without him hurting her, chu!

368
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,500
[DOLUGH] But, Chuta, if we don't
do anything, she'll suffocate!

00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,041
[CHUTA]
But what can we do?

370
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,333
Sonokata, don't do it!

371

I can't believe bubblegum
can be so evil, chu!

I feel so useless!

Chuta!

374
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,458
Do you remember what
we did that time

375
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,250
Mimi got gum stuck on her
shirt and it wouldn't wash off?

376
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,333
Aww, look at this!

377
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,250
[DOLUGH] If we do now what we
did then, we'll save her.

378
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,708
You think it'll work?

379
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:48,000
As long as you imagine
it, I can do it!

'Kay! Here goes!

381
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,416
The key to removing gum
is to freeze it off!

I like working with you!

say thank you!

holding it over my head.

What's with the crater, chu?

[RIGGS]
I think we know what that means.

408
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:18,291
We do. They killed him
and left that symbol.

409
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,000
Just as a warning.

410
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,916
We're dealing with a
criminal organization

20,000 light years away,

headed right toward us?

Tateyan. Why're you here?

421
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,375
The candy shop lady
told me what happened.

422
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,000
Your friend brought
rice crackers

423
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,458
as a get-well-soon gift!

Oh, nice. Thanks, Tateyan.

425

[TATEYAN]
Has anyone ever told you

426
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,916
that your aunt looks like
pop idol Yui Sakuraebi?

427
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,500
I've never heard that. Sorry.

428
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,791
That's okay.

429
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,291
I had a weird dream.

430
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,750
I don't remember all the
details, but I was about to die

431
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,833
until you came over
and saved me.

432
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,333
[CHUTA]
Dream, huh.

433
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,833
[DOLUGH] elDLIVE must've
changed his memories.

434
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:23,041
Well, you know, sometimes...
a dream is just a dream.

435
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,500
Good point. Just a dream.

436
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,625
You're a pretty
wise dude, Chuta.

437
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,958
[DOLUGH]
And you're gullible!

438
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,541
Even though it was a dream,

439
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:35,083
it's like, deep down I know
we're friends for real.

440
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,375
[DOLUGH] You know what
this feeling is, Chuta?

441
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,041
It's you starting to form
deep connections with others.

442
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,375
[CHUTA] You don't have to
comment on my every emotion!

Aunt Mimi, why're you crying?

[wails]

446
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:50,458
My sweet little Chuta
finally made a friend!

447
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,166
I think you're
overreacting a bit!

448
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,208
[DOLUGH]
But she's not, Chuta.

449
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,958
Ever since the falling
incident as a kid,

450
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,833
and until you joined elDLIVE,

451
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,041
you've been completely
friend-less, Chuta.

452
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,625
[CHUTA]
Maybe you're right.

453
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,291
I didn't realize
how alone I was.

454
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:10,166
I forgot what it felt like
to even have friends.

455
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,000
In fact, over the last few days,

456
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:15,541
I've realized a whole
bunch of things.

457
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,708
About my family. My friends.

458
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,500
And about myself.

459
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:22,750
Dolugh's right.

460
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,041
The best thing that's
ever happened to me

461
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,041
is joining elDLIVE.

462
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,000
Ah. Looks like someone's
made it official.

463
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,791
Wow, The uniform
looks great on you!

464
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,083
I like it, Chuta.

465
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,333
You pull off this
look pretty well!

466
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,791
Whatever you do, do not
wear this outfit to school.

467
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,875
Of course I won't!
I'm not that dumb!

468
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,833
Next up: Chuta's
entrance ceremony!

469
