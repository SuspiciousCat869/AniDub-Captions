00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,958
Oh, Chuta, thank you so much!

160
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,416
[VOICE]
You're really earning your keep!

161
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,208
Whatever, it's not a big deal.

162
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,208
[MIMI]
Huh?

163
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,416
Oh, it's nothing.

164
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,125
Hey, Aunt Mimi,
you wanna try the dish

165
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,500
I made today in cooking class?

166
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,416
It's good!

167
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Woohoo! Thanks!

168
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:49,083
I've been so busy baking,
I totally spaced on lunch!

169
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,125
So good!

170
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,083
Was everything okay
at school today?

171
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,208
What?

172
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,375
I know how when you
talk to yourself,

173
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,750
it can push people away.

174
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,500
No! Nothing happened!

175
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,625
[grunts]

176
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,708
[MIMI]
Are you okay?

177
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,583
Yeah. I'm fine.

178
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,708
[CHUTA] After I lost my parents,
Aunt Mimi raised me on her own.

179
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,750
She knows me better than
anyone, which, of course,

180
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,583
means I can't really hide
anything from her.

181
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,458
[VOICE]
I think someone's here.

182
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,333
I hope you die and
I never see you again.

183
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,500
Boy, she really enjoys
throwing salt in the wound.

184
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,625
I guess every rose
does have its thorns.

185
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,083
[VOICE]
Chuta, someone's here!

186
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,625
But I don't care
how mean she is.

187
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,333
She's still the cutest
girl I've ever seen!

188
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,333
[MALE VOICE] Particle changes
in the target confirmed.

189
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,208
We are go for transfer!

190
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,875
[VOICE]
Ah! Why's it so bright?

191
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,500
--[VOICE] Too bright!
--What? What's happening?

192
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,333
[VOICE]
Chuta, what is this?

193
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,833
Your guess is as good as mine!

194
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,416
Ow. That hurt.

195
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,458
[VOICE]
Where are we?

196
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,041
Chuta! We're in a
completely different place!

197
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,708
[door opens]

198
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,000
[CHUTA]
Uh?

199
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,750
What is this place?
Am I dreaming or what?

200
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,166
Definitely not the muffin shop.

201
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,875
[VOICE] I think there's
something over there.

202
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,875
Chuta, go look over there!

203
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,541
All right, already.
Shut up and...

204
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,583
What's wrong with him? Why's
he talking to himself so much?

205
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,916
Must've hit his head
too hard on the landing.

206
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,375
Constantly talking to
oneself is not attributed

207
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,916
to normal Earthling behavior.

208
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,500
Yeah, and the Earthlings
we've worked with

209
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,750
don't do it anywhere near
as much as this boy.

210
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,875
[VOICE]
Go! Go through the door!

211
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,458
[gasps]

212
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,083
[gasps]

00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,291
[yelps]

214
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,791
[VOICE]
Cats? Chicks? Triangles?

215
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,458
They look suspicious, Chuta.

216
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,583
Maybe it's an
anime con? Cosplay?

217
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:58,750
[LAINE] Chuta Kokonose,
just the boy I wanted to see!

218
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,791
Welcome to the
elDLIVE Space Police!

219
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,750
[SPACE POLICE]
Yoyosa!

220
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:07,250
What? elDLIVE? Space Police?

221
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,583
That's right. I'm Laine Brick.

222
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:14,583
And I'm the chief of this solar
system's elDLIVE Bureau.

223
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,458
[SPACE EXEC A] Of all the
billions of Earthlings,

224
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:20,250
why was this boy chosen to join
an elite group like elDLIVE?

225
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,166
[SPACE EXEC B] Yes, judging
from the data we've seen,

226
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,416
nothing indicates he has special
talent or even character.

227
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,416
Gentlemen, if I may.

228
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,583
He was chosen
straight by Mothers.

229
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,208
Wait, what? I was chosen?

230
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,041
[LAINE]
That's right.

231
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,291
We at elDLIVE recruit
any and all beings

232
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,750
who show the potential to become
great Space Police officers.

233
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,875
Across the universe is a vast,
decentralized super-computer

234
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,291
called Mothers.

235
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,791
And in her infinite wisdom,

236
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,750
Mothers has picked you
to join us, Chuta.

237
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,083
Hey, now wait a second!

238
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,666
I'm not just going to join
the "Space Police."

239
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,125
How do I even know
this is all real?

240
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,833
Oh, this elDLIVE Bureau
is real, I assure you.

241
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,916
It's the Jeanrenoi-R!

242
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,250
The who-what?

243
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,750
Yeah.

244
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,875
I know it's a lot to take in
so maybe I should show you?

245
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,708
Hey, Riggs, Tonto, come here.

246
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,791
[BOTH]
Yoyosa!

247
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,625
[CHUTA]
Huh?!

248
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,833
Subject loaded to ejection
block and ready for exit!

249
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,333
Wait, stop! Let me outta here!

250
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,166
Good? Launch away!

251
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,833
[YUTA]
Yoyosa!

252
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,750
[VOICE] The hatch is
opening. It's opening!

253
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,333
[CHUTA]
Eh? Oh, no.

254
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,083
[VOICE] Turn-around, Chuta!
Something's behind us!

255
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,708
It's huge! It's Earth!

256
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,958
[CHUTA]
I hate the Space Police!

257
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,666
Oh, wow.

258
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,041
[LAINE]
Turn around to get a good view

259
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,708
of your local elDLIVE Bureau!

260
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,791
[CHUTA]
The Bureau's a space ship?!

261
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,458
[VOICE] It can't be!
That's just a special effect!

262
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,666
[MELIES chuckles]

263
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,791
Earthlings have
such sloppy form.

264
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,708
Ah! A floating head!

265
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,083
[VOICE]
That looks like a moon!

266
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,250
[MARLY]
Melies, don't scare him.

267
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,166
You can hold my hand
if you're scared.

268
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,625
[CHUTA]
Which one? You have eight!

269
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:14,916
[VOICE]
I count ten.

270
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,458
[LAINE] There are as many
different life forms

271
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,458
as there are stars
in the cosmos.

272
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,125
And we serve them all.

273
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,875
To protect and maintain order
cross the entire universe!

274
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,500
That is the mission
we strive for

275
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,958
as members of Space
Police elDLIVE!

276
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,750
He's got a way with words.

277
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,708
Coming from anyone else,
it would sound so cheesy.

278
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,000
[LAINE]
Anyway, kid,

279
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,083
all you have to do is pass
the qualifying exam,

280
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,083
and you'll be the latest member
of our special family!

281
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,833
What?! A member?!

282
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,000
Hold on, I haven't expressed
any interest in joining you!

283
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,583
Ha! They all say that.
Let's start the test!

284
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,166
Come on, don't I have a choice?

285
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,875
[VOICE]
Stop whining, Chuta!

286
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,291
Becoming a Space Policeman
sounds like a blast.

287
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,541
Just take the test!

288
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,833
Hey, shut up! I'm through
listening to you!

289
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,791
Man, he really does
talk to himself a lot.

290
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:00,708
[CHUTA]
Um, so...

291
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,375
[LAINE]
Hm?

292
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,083
[CHUTA]
...I don't wanna do it.

293
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,250
[sighs]

294
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,708
Come on, kid, the
exam isn't that hard.

295
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:08,833
I said no.

296
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,333
Okay. This isn't good.

297
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,416
Well, what are we gonna
tell the home office?

298
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,875
I know!

299
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,541
What if by some coincidence
we suffered a "wink-wink"

300
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,750
mechanical failure
with life support?

301
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,916
Oh. I gotcha.

302
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,458
Like there's a terrible accident

303
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,250
where the oxygen runs
out of his space suit

304
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,541
and Chuta's unable to
take the qualifying exam

305
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,750
and we're off the hook
with the bosses!

306
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,000
[CHUTA] You know I can hear
everything you're saying!

307
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,916
I do not agree with this.

308
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,625
As you've no doubt seen from
his habit of talking to himself,

309
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,500
he suffers from
delusions...

310
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,250
[VOICE]
I know this voice.

311
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,666
[GIRL] ...constantly indulges
them, no matter where he is.

312
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,791
His cringe-factor is ten
times higher than average

313
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,666
of other middle schoolers
in his country.

314
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,166
Sooner or later,
he'll be subject

Uh.

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,416
There's a C-rank criminal
from planet Chabrol

hiding out on Earth,

and your mission is to arrest
him for us with these.

Do all that and
you pass the test.

thing dangerous?

[LAINE]
Hmm.

336
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,833
Well, it's a
carnivorous predator,

337
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,583

you might be eaten alive.

Yeah. Right by my house!

funny that all this time

there's been an alien
right under your nose.

It's not funny!

[VOICE] Okay, okay.
Let's just find the alien!

I don't think it's
gonna be that easy.

Where do I start?

357
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,458
I mean, everyone
I see around here

358
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:22,125
looks like they could be
an alien in disguise.

359
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,916
Huh.

360
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,833
Of all the Earthlings, I wonder
why Mothers picked him.

Oh, wow.

00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,416
Data on Chuta Kokonose.

00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,083
Sseen some strange thermographic
readings in my day,

slightly higher than the rest.

Maybe this is just a test
and there isn't an alien here.

who smells like oil!

Oh, no. Of course not.

blooming after a spring shower!

Her smell?

390
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,416
That might have something
to do with her SPH.

No way, Chief.

392

The science is clear
that sensing SPH

393

is physically impossible
for Earthlings.

smell is coming from Blob-Blob.

It's the only answer
that makes sense!

For the last time,

she doesn't smell bad,

her "Blob-Blob,"

00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,916
Oh, look, I can make
his head pop off!

473
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,833
Let go!

474
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,416
Squeezy-squeeze!

475
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,000
Stop it!

476
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:54,958
[VOICE]
Sympathy!

477
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,041
[CHUTA]
Huh?

478
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,583
[SAOTOME screams]

479
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,500
[CHUTA gasps]

480
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,083
It's been a while since
someone activated

481
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,916
my Symbiotic Technique!

482
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,250
[CHUTA]
What?

483
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,333
[CHUTA yelps]

484
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,625
What-What the heck?!

485
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:14,833
[LAINE]
The symbol on its forehead

486
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,916
is that of the Lost Griffith!

487
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,083
And if it's operating on Earth,

488
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:24,166
that's a sure sign that we're
dealing with... a Monitalien!

489
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,041
They're a kind of observer.

490
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,583
Special organisms scattered
across the universe

491
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:29,958
on countless planets.

492
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,875
The people of
Griffith created them

493
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,666
over four billion years ago.

494
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,041
[KIESHI]
Hm...

495
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,458
What's with the
weird look, Chuta?

496
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:40,208
No way!

497
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,666
You can see me?

498
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,666
You're the voice? You mean
all this time it's been you?

499
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,666
I'll have to explain it later.

500
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,416
The Blob-Blob's waking up!

501
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,625
I don't know where that
energy blast came from,

502
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,500
but I'm sure gonna
make you pay for it!

503
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,916
[CHUTA screams]

504
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,333
You look tasty!

505
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,791
No way.

506
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,625
Use your imagination!

507
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:07,166
All you have to do is
picture an attack for us

508
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,375
and it'll happen for real!

509
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,000
Okay.

510
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,666
[SAOTOME]
Bon appetit!

511
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,375
[roars]

512
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,833
Uh, Voice?

513
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,208
Look at Blob-Blob's body

514
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,250
and think about how
we can defeat it.

515
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,666
[CHUTA]
Huh?

516
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,916
Its body?

517
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,416
Well, it's flabby and
loose like old fabric.

518
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,750
What if we cinch him into a ball
so he's not a danger anymore?

519
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,458
[VOICe]
Sympathy!

520
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:31,875
Here goes!

521
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,083
[SAOTOME]
Hey! I can't breathe!

522
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,250
[CHUTA]
Huh?

523
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,791
And don't forget the handcuffs!

524
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,791
Uh, now that we got that thing,

525
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,958
what the heck are you?

526
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,583
So the newest member of
elDLIVE's an Earthling

527
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:03,666
who's able to tap the
power of a Monitalien.

528
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,708
Heh.

529
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,875
I like.

530
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,750
[CHUTA]
Ow!

531
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,666
[LAINE]
Chuta Kokonose!

532
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,208
Congratulations, kid,
you passed the entrance exam.

533
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:17,416
I passed? For real?

534
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,416
[GIRL]
I'm still against this.

535
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:25,291
[GIRL grunts]

536
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,500
Wait, you're her?

537
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:30,083
Misuzu is a Space Cop?

538
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,791
[DOLUGH] Our sewing attack
worked pretty well.

539
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,375
[CHUTA]
Yeah!

540
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,041
[LAINE] It worked, but you need
to come up with a better move.

541
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,041
[CHUTA]
Hey, I think sewing's cool!

542
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:40,708
[LAINE]
Eh.

543
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,416
[CHUTA]
Aw.

544
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,791
[DOLUGH] Next time on <i>elDLIVE</i> :
"Super Cool Space Girl"!

545
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:47,041
[LAINE] By the way, could you
fix a hole in one of my socks?
