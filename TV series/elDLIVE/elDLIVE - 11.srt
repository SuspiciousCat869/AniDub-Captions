Indeed. It's very accurate.

bigger than I thought.

00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,125
So this e-mail, what do
you think it's all about?

227
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,583
Do you really think Chief and
the other bosses at elDLIVE

228
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,708
are hiding something big about
the Mount Taketori incident?

I don't think Chief Laine
even knows about it.

Of course we keep secrets.

But if you're as concerned
as I think you are,

why not do a little
poking around the Bureau

[CHUTA] First, I'm tracking down
whoever sent me this email.

263
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,041
The key is to find out
where it came from.

264
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,916
That should be a clue
to the person's identity.

265
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,375
Why don't you ask
Chief Laine first?

266
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,750
Because even if I did, there's
no way he'd tell me anything.

00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,291
No, Vega has it right.

268
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,416
To find the truth, I'll just
have to investigate on my own.

269

And you know what, Dolugh.

If it was sent to

introduction.

320
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,291
I've a flair for the dramatic.

321
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,958
[LAINE]
If this is a full-on invasion,

322
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,833
why are we even
talking right now?

323
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,541
What do you really want
from us, DeMille Junior?

324
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,875
I'm impressed, Chief.
You cut right to the chase.

325
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,583
We simply demand
that you hand over

326
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,333
the Monitalien in
your possession.

327
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,291
Along with its host,
Chuta Kokonose.

328
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,750
If you do not
meet this demand,

329
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,875
the invasion will
begin in earnest.

330
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,208
They can't!

331
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,708
[LAINE] Why do you want
the Monitalien so bad?

332
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,083
[DEMILLE JUNIOR] Let's just
say an updated Monitalien

333
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,458
is of great value to us.

334
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:10,583
[LAINE]
Of course it is.

335
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,541
And that's why we'll
never give it up.

336
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,875
We've already hit your ship once
and are happy to do it again.

337
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,708
Give them up.

338
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:18,750
True.

339
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,833
Based on our current
weapon systems,

340
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:24,708
it'd be impossible to
fight them head-on.

341
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,250
But having said that,

342
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,583
I still have my research
facilities left on Earth.

343
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:30,833
With those weapons,

344
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,458
it is possible to attack
Earth's exoatmosphere.

345
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:36,125
After that, disabling the
DeMille ship's main gun

346
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,208
becomes academic.

347
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,333
So, Chief. What's the plan?

348
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,583
I can't believe you're
still thinking this over.

349
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:49,208
I'm guessing you won't find many
decisions easier than this.

350
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,458
[LAINE] Yeah. You're
right on that count.

351
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,666
There's only one answer
to this situation.

352
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,666
All hands to battlestations!

353
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,166
All right, we're taking
their ship down!

354
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,625
[ALL]
Yoyosa!

355
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,833
Fire volley!

356
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,541
[LAINE]
You're up, Doc!

357
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,458
--Hell yeah!
--We did it!

358
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,208
[alarm sounding]

359
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,416
What's wrong?

360
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,625
[MCCLANE] Well, Chief,
they weren't kidding

361
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:24,875
about the invasion.

362
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,583
DeMille ships are
appearing all over Earth!

363
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,250
Their fleet was already here?

364
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,500
Tricked us again.

365
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,125
You do see now that
resistance is futile.

366
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,250
Chief, I'll give you
just one hour.

367
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,291
Gather the Monitalien
and Chuta Kokonose

368
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,125
and give them to me.

369
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,750
If they're not on
my ship by then,

370
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,208
I'll order my fleet
to attack the Earth.

371
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,208
[RIGGS]
An hour. Damn.

372
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,250
That's not enough
time for a plan B!

373
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,708
Crap! We're almost
down to 59 minutes!

374
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,083
If only Chuta hadn't
uploaded that virus!

375
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,333
Maybe he's a spy planted
here by DeMille!

376
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,541
[TONTO]
He is not a spy!

377
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,666
That is enough!

378
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:02,708
[door opens]

379
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,166
[CHUTA]
Chief Laine!

380
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,833
This-This is all
my fault, right?

381
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,166
Huh, how so?

382
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,333
Because of what I did...
DeMille can take over the Earth.

383
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:18,041
[VEGA]
Don't beat yourself up.

384
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,541
[CHUTA]
You guys.

385
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,833
I'm gonna turn myself
over to DeMille!

386
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,000
It's the best way to end this!

387
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,333
Oh, Chuta.

388
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,583
Chief Laine! Contact them!

389
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,625
Let DeMille know that
I'm surrendering myself!

390
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,833
[CHIPS] Enough crazy talk,
chu! Listen to me!

391
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:40,458
This isn't just your problem
now, Officer Kokonose!

392
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,375
Then what do you
think I should do?

393
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,500
Chief Laine, we might be
able to buy some time

394
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,000
by sending Chuta down to
Earth and hiding him there.

395
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,000
What?

396
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,250
And let's face it.

397
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,750
It's certainly safer
than staying here.

398
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,125
You're right, Vega.

399
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,458
Inspector Chips, I want
you to accompany Chuta

400
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,833
to the Space Café.

401
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,166
And don't make another move
until you hear from me.

402
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:01,833
--Yoyosa!
--No!

403
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,625
Let me go to them!

404
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,833
[BOTH groaning]

405
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,083
[CHIPS]
Chu.

406
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,083
[CHIPS] The streets
are totally empty, chu.

407
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,208
I'm getting a bad vibe, chu!

408
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,416
Huh? Officer Kokonose?

409
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,625
[MIMI]
"Dear Chuta.

410
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,250
I'm taking shelter in the
school's gymnasium."

411
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,916
[DOLUGH]
At least Aunt Mimi is safe.

412
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,500
Once again...

413
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,250
...because I did something
I shouldn't have,

414
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,750
other people suffer.

415
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:59,125
Don't think like that!
I'm starting to disappear again!

416
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,666
When you lose your confidence,
you also lose me!

417
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,625
I'm so... I'm so stupid.

418
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,250
It looks like a message.

419
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,583
[DOLUGH]
It's from Gucchi!

420
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:18,791
[CHUTA]
Huh?

421
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,041
[DOLUGH] He's trying
to talk to you, Chuta.

422
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,208
I think I can still read it.

423
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,250
Do you want me to?

424
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,041
Of course, hurry up!

425
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,000
[DOLUGH]
"DeMille is on the move.

426
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:32,041
They desperately
want to find Dolugh.

00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,916
Your elDLIVE Bureau
is compromised.

428
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,541

is a DeMille spy.

429
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,416
Be careful, Chuta.

430
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,000
Because that spy person is--"

Hey.

435
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,458
I thought Chief gave
you and Chips orders

436
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,958
to hide in the Space Café?

437

[CHUTA]
Vega. What should I do?

00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,500
Chuta...

00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,875
I need your advice.

00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:22,500
What would you do if
you were in my shoes?

441
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:25,208
[VEGA] I don't know.
That's a hard one.

442
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,000
Officer Kokonose!

443
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,333
Why're you here?

444
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,291
[MISUZU]
Same reason as you, Inspector.

445
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,916
I was worried sick
about Officer Kokonose.

446
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,458
Uh, just like everyone
else is at the Bureau.

447
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,541
Ah, that's just for show.

448
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,708
They won't let me
do what's right.

449
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,041
You know the truth,
right, Sonokata?

450
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:47,791
About the accident on Mount
Taketori when I was a child?

451
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,375
I thought my friend died.

452
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,750
But he ended up an executive
officer with DeMille.

453
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,041
It wouldn't be weird for elDLIVE

454
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:58,166
to be looking into
all this, would it?

455
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,416
But it feels like Chief and
everybody else wants me close,

456
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,333
but not too close.

457
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,041
Kokonose.

458
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,208
Chief gave me this
to give to you.

459
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:13,041
I'm sorry I didn't have a chance
to give it to you sooner.

460
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,833
This is the complete
Mount Taketori case file.

461
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,750
Everything elDLIVE has on it.

462
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:20,833
I found out after he joined up.

463
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,583
The Taketori incident
has elements

464
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:25,125
that put it under
our jurisdiction.

465
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:28,125
Mainly, that one of
his friends survived,

466
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,750
and is now an
officer with DeMille.

467
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:34,083
I'm sure Chuta's even more
confused about this than we are.

468
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,833
I wanted to tell him what we
knew when the time was right,

469
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,416
but it hasn't worked out.

470
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,625
Like you've said,
Officer Kokonose,

471
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:44,125
everything that happened on that
mountain's a confusing mystery.

472
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,750
But the one thing we
do know for sure

473
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,625
is that aliens were
somehow involved.

474
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,833
He believes in me.

475
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,916
He believes that I
can handle the truth.

476
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,875
But I failed us.

[MISUZU]
Kokonose!

478
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,041
The only thing that matters now

479
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,833
is that you can
protect the Earth.

480
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,541
As an officer of elDLIVE!

481
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:18,125
That's right.
I can't give up now!

482
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:35,708
[CHUTA] That's right.
I can't give up now!

483
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:36,958
It's the challenge of my life,

484
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,583
and I'll get through it
as a member of elDLIVE!

485
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,250
Let's go, Sonokata!

Next time on <i>elDLIVE</i> :

487
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,625
[CHUTA, MISUZU]
"Our sympathy"!

488
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:47,000
[CHUTA] We'll protect the
Earth, no matter what!
