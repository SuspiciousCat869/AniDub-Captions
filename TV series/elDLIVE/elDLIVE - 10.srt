1
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:15,041
[MARUKOBI]
My name's Ichiro Marukobi.

2
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:18,208
[MARUKOBI] They say there are
three other people in the world

3
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,500
who look just like you,
but in my case,

4
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:23,041
it's a whole lot more than that.

5
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,708
Please come again.

6
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,708
[BOYS laughing]

7
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:33,083
[MARUKOBI] Guess I must
be special or something.

8
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,833
Not that it's done me
any good up till now.

9
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,000
[MELPLEIAN A]
Sorry you had to wait.

10
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,250
Uh, sorry, do I know you?

11
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,208
Oh, stop kidding
around, you kidder.

12
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:48,583
Now, let's hurry up and go.
We're gonna be late.

13
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:51,708
[MARUKOBI]
Huh? Go where? Wait!

14
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:55,000
Hold on! I think you
have the wrong guy!

15
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:59,166
[MELPLEIAN B]
Do you know how late you are?

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,416
[MELPLEIAN A]
I'm so sorry!

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,666
[MELPLEIAN C] I thought
you weren't gonna come.

18
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,791
Well, of course she came.
How could she not?

19
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,166
[MELPLEIANS laughing]

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,500
[MARUKOBI]
Crap! What's going on?

21
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,708
Skaa!

22
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:15,250
Now then, let's get started...
with this mixer!

23
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:19,541
[MARUKOBI]
M-M-Mixer?!

24
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,333
[MISUZU]
This SPH...

25
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:03,375
...reminds me of playing in
a grassy field as a child.

26
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:06,625
It's like a gentle scent.
One that I love.

27
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,791
It feels so warm and
refreshing to me.

28
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:10,708
[ISAAC]
Huh.

29
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,333
Well, you're all clear.

30
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:16,458
Now then, is there anything
else bothering you today?

31
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,708
Not really.

32
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,250
For example,

33
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,000
is there some SPH that never
caught your attention before,

34
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,375
but now, it suddenly just
makes you uncomfortable?

35
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,875
[gasps]

36
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,416
Meaning, do any of
them have a bad scent?

37
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,041
Like, say, Officer
Kokonose's SPH?

38
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,250
How'd you--?

39
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,000
I got him to confess.

40
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,666
See, I've noticed that his SPH's

41
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,958
accuracy and intensity
have increased.

42
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,500
It seems Chuta must have
matured a little after updating.

43
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:49,083
[MISUZU] It's fine. I can
endure Officer Kokonose's SPH.

44
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,708
It doesn't affect my work.

45
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,166
Calm down now.

46
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,208
We're not tryin' to take your
job away here, Misuzu.

47
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,333
[MISUZU]
But--

48
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,625
Just tell us honestly
what happened.

49
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,708
I'm quite fascinated.

50
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,916
Okay, well, when Officer
Kokonose first showed

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,333
the updated Monitalien to me,

52
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:13,208
there was something very strong
and foul about his SPH.

53
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,291
The smell was so powerful,

54
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,333
it went up my nose and felt like
my brain was going to split.

55
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,708
It's difficult now for me to
even stand in front of him

56
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,291
without wearing nose plugs.

57
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,041
Ah, now I see.

58
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:28,250
I may've narrowed down
the possible causes.

59
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,916
Here, try this.

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,416
It's a hairpin-type SPH curtain.

61
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,208
You can cut down on a specific
SPH just by wearing it.

62
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,333
What's the problem?

63
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,583
Uh, does it come
in another design?

64
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:46,250
This isn't my style.
It's too childish.

65
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,875
[grumbles]

66
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:53,500
[sighs]

67
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,000
[VERONICA]
Misuzu?

68
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,583
What's that in your hair?

69
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,500
[MISUZU]
Oh. Nothing.

70
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,291
Just a new hairpin, that's all.

71
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,833
Oh, I see.

72
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,375
So that's the kind of thing
that you're into, is it?

73
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,875
Got a problem with that?

74
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:09,291
Not really. It's just
unlike you to be so girly.

75
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,500
Honestly, it looks a
little bit childish.

76
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,875
[MISUZU growls]

77
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,875
Uh, well, I don't think
it's really all that weird.

78
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,291
I mean, I totally get wanting
to change up your hairstyle

79
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,375
like that every now and then.

80
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,708
It's just too bad
that my battle suit

81
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,416
is so embarrassingly revealing.

82
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,833
If I were to cut my hair any,

83
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,041
I don't think there'd be
enough left to cover my body.

84
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,916
Well, come to think of it,

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,875
Officer Kokonose sure saw
a lot of you the other day.

86
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,250
[whining]

87
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,041
[VERONICA]
Well, time for work!

88
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,375
[VIRGIL] So you had
a run-in with a thief?

89
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,625
Was there anything
valuable in your bag, sir?

90
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,041
So it was an
attempted kidnapping?

91
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,166
[JAECKINIAN A]
I was groped by a groper!

92
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,791
Please, calm down, ma'am.

93
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,416
Somebody poked my elbow!

94
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,833
For my kind, elbows are
as intimate as boobs are

95
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:54,833
to you Earthlings!

96
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,625
Did you say boobies?

97
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,666
'Kay, um, guess I'll make a
composite sketch of the suspect?

98
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,958
I don't want you!

99
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,583
I'd rather have this
handsome fella over here.

100
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,875
[CHUTA]
Huh?

101
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,583
That's right. I got this, chu!

102
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,916
[sighs]

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,583
[DOLUGH] Chuta!
Misuzu's looking over here.

104
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,375
Oh, good morning.

105
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,083
Uh, good morning.

106
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,458
[DOLUGH] Hey, look! She's not
wearing her nose plugs!

107
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,166
Sonokata, your nose
plugs. But my smell.

108
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,541
[MISUZU]
What about it?

109
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,500
Huh? Well, uh...

110
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,791
The nose plugs were
just an accessory.

111
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,458
And they had nothing
to do with your SPH.

112
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:41,083
[CHUTA] Seriously?!
So I just had the wrong idea?

113
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,416
You mean I don't stink?

114
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,250
Right.

115
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,833
For real? Nah.

116
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,416
Yes.

117
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,083
[CHUTA] So then all this time
I've been worried for nothing?!

118
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,958
What's that? I've never
seen you wear hair clips.

119
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,666
Yes, I know it's childish!

120
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,875
[CHUTA]
Huh?

121
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,083
I mean, I'm just not
really that fond of it.

122
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,666
Then, why are you wearing
it if you don't like it?

123
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,416
[MISUZU]
Um... For my appearance.

124
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,875
Wait, what?

125
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,583
[MISUZU] It doesn't matter.
Just leave it alone.

126
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,291
[CHUTA] I actually think
it looks nice on her.

127
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,333
Why yes, he looked
just like that.

128
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,333
[MISUZU] Inspector Chips,
I'm sorry that I'm so late.

129
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:21,791
Just finishing up a composite
sketch of this groper, chu.

130
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,333
Something like this, chu?

131
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,875
Wait, that face... I think
I saw it in another division.

132
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,416
[CHIPS]
Chu?

133
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,833
That's the bag snatcher.

134
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,583
They look alike.

135
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,750
He tried to kidnap a baby.

136
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,250
Looks the same.

137
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:39,541
Bag snatching, a
baby-napping, and groping?

138
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,958
And the composite sketches were
the same for all three cases.

139
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,083
Does that mean it
was all the same guy?

140
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,333
[VIRGIL
Hm...

141
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,666
I'll run a search for this face

142
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,083
among the composite
sketches in our database.

143
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,333
What the--? It can't be!

144
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,416
[CHUTA, VIRGIL]
Huh?

145
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,250
[VERONICA]
What the heck is going on?

146
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,875
[NINOTCHKA]
I conducted a search for anyone

147
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,458
matching that facial data
within Shizuoka Prefecture

148
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,666
where the incidents occurred,
and I got 152 hits.

149
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,416
How are there so many?

150
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,875
Oh, that's simple, chu!

151
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,875
Because when alien
species like the Dunians,

152
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,541
who don't have transformation
abilities, come to Earth,

153
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,625
they're required to get
temporary cosmetic surgery

154
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,166
that makes them look
like Earthlings while visiting.

155
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,500
Yeah, but that doesn't mean

156
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,333
that they all have to have
the same face, does it?

157
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,250
Well, the Dunian government
is pretty lax, so, y'know...

158
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,833
I'll send 'em a stern
warning about that.

159
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,041
But this is really bad, chu.

160
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,666
If the culprit is one
of those look-alikes,

161
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,166
it's gonna be difficult
to find them, chu.

162
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,333
So what else do we know
about his appearance?

163
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,583
Yeah, in all three cases,

164
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,000
the suspect was wearing
a red hoodie and jeans.

165
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,833
Was there an SPH signal
detected at the crime scenes?

166
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,625
[NINOTCHKA] Well, unfortunately,
just like Earthlings,

167
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,250
they don't emit any SPH,

168
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:49,083
so we have no choice but to
interrogate all 152 of them.

169
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,375
Yeah, um, I was hoping to make
it home for dinner tonight.

170
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,125
Do you think we'll
be done by then?

171
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,666
Not a chance.

172
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,208
But isn't bringing peace to the
galaxy worth the price, chu?

173
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,875
Yeah, that's the spirit!

174
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,125
I'll let you guys
handle the interviews.

175
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,541
This case involves
three divisions

176
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,416
of the Investigations
Department, chu.

177
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,000
We have to work together, chu!

178
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,416
Well, Misuzu from Division Two

179
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,166
was the first to realize
that they were connected,

180
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,041
so I'd really hate
to steal her thunder.

181
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,416
[DOLUGH]
Wow, Chuta,

182
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,458
it sounds like nobody
wants to do this assignment.

183
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,833
[chuckles nervously]

184
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,666
[VERONICA] Well, we're
counting on you, Misuzu.

185
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,333
We can't do this
by ourselves, chu!

186
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,500
Heads up,
Investigations Department.

187
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,291
An arson case was
reported on Earth

188
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,375
and it's possible it's an
intergalactic incident.

189
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,250
Need someone there right away.

190
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,291
Yes! Finally an
exciting assignment!

191
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,125
This kinda thing is
right up my alley!

192
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,250
How can we possibly lose, chu?

193
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,500
Let's do it!

194
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,500
[ALL]
We got this!

195
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,541
Let's see now,
who should I send?

196
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,708
If it's an arson case, it'd be
best to let Division Two go.

197
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,500
Why?

198
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,500
Oh, yeah? And why is that?

199
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,041
Veronica from Division Five
hasn't fully recovered

200
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,875
from her surgery after the
remote control SPH case.

201
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,833
And I only recently
reattached Virgil

202
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,833
from Division One's
neck and legs.

203
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,875
Oh, come on, this is nothing.

204
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,666
Well, I guess I do
owe you my life, Doc.

205
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,833
We're all counting
on you, Division Two.

206
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,375
[ALL]
Yoyosa!

207
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,916
Actually, I'm pretty sure
Veronica and Virgil's wounds

208
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,125
have completely healed.

209
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,291
Of course they have.

210
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,583
I'm the one who
treated them, after all.

211
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,208
Then why say that?

212
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:17,041
I have a feeling that the
reason for Kokonose's smell

213
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,833
is about to become
abundantly clear.

214
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,541
[ALL groaning]

215
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,208
[MISUZU]
Let's go.

216
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,958
I suspect that smoke is
coming from the arson site.

217
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,541
[CHUTA]
The police are here.

218
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:48,833
[CHIPS]
A lot of intergalactic crimes

219
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,208
are recognized by Earthlings

220
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,333
as something that might
happen in their own society,

221
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,916
or that they're familiar with.

222
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,166
Actually, they're reported
to the police pretty often.

223
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,791
You'd be surprised, chu.

224
00:10:58,875 --> 00:10:59,833
Let's get out of here.

225
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:00,708
[CHUTA]
Huh?

226
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,583
Hey, where are we going?

227
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,375
If we try to scope out
the crime scene now,

228
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,916
we won't be able to get close
because of all the police.

229
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,291
So we're gonna make
a detour, chu!

230
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,791
[ROBOTIC VOICE A] Identification
complete. You may now enter.

231
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,083
[CHUTA]
Whoa. What is this place?

232
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,791
[CHIPS]
It's an exclusive café!

233
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,833
You need either an
intergalactic passport

234
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,541
or an elDLIVE badge
just to get in.

235
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:23,750
It's a special place

236
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,625
where aliens can be
in their natural form.

237
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,500
Who knew this
kinda place existed?

238
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,916
Let's ask some questions.

239
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,500
Start over there, chu.

240
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,916
Now then.

241
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,333
We're looking for an arsonist.

242
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,500
Your help would be
greatly appreciated.

243
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,500
No thanks, honey.
Not interested.

244
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,541
Just tell me whatever you know
and this'll all be over quickly.

245
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,166
Wow, you're extremely annoying.

246
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,333
Sir, if you refuse to
cooperate with us,

247
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,708
I'll have to arrest you for
aiding and abetting a criminal.

248
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,708
[yelps]

249
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,125
[CHIPS]
Hold it, Misuzu!

250
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:54,416
That's going a little overboard,
don't you think, chu?

251
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,750
[CHUTA laughing]

252
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,333
Oh, now, darling,
don't be silly.

253
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,416
Of course you can't make
an omelet without milk.

254
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,333
Right, that's what
makes 'em so fluffy.

255
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,791
[COW ALIEN A] So what was it
you were investigating, moo?

256
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,583
[CHUTA] Well, ma'am,
it's an arson case.

257
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,291
[COW ALIEN A] Oh, you mean
that fire that happened

258
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,208
just around the
corner from here.

259
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,750
You'd better hurry up
and answer, or else I'll--

260
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,416
Misuzu, calm down, chu!

261
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,291
[CHUTA]
Uh, Sonokata.

262
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,125
[MELPLEIAN A]
Hey, you there!

263
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:25,208
Just what are you doing...
with my beloved?

264
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,750
Melpleian robot!

265
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:30,583
Oh, no, chu! That's an
actual Melpleian, chu!

266
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,333
[MELPLEIAN A]
Skaa.

267
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,833
Prepare to be---

268
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,583
[CHUTA]
Oh, wow! Look at that pouch!

269
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,125
Did you make that yourself?

270
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,416
The cross-stitching's
so beautifully detailed.

271
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,833
Thank you for noticing.

272
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,208
Yeah, of course!

273
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:45,041
And my sweetie-pie made
me this spiffy outfit, too!

274
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,291
[CHUTA]
Whoa, you can also make clothes?

275
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,875
[OCTOPUS ALIEN A]
My sweetie-pie is the best...

276
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,166
We can probably get some
information from them now, chu.

277
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,541
An arson case?

278
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,208
[CHIPS] We're trying to
find the suspect, chu.

279
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,458
Ah.

280
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,125
Y'know, come to think of it,

281
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,458
I saw a suspicious guy in a red
hoodie that was near the scene.

282
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,916
A red hoodie?

283
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,041
[CHIPS]
Could it have been this man?

284
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,291
Oh yeah, that's
definitely the guy.

285
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,666
[CHIPS, CHUTA gasp]

286
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,291
What the heck is going on, chu?

287
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,291
Certainly wasn't expecting
the arson to be caused

288
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,958
by the Dunian in the
red hoodie, too.

289
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,916
Purse snatching,
attempted kidnapping,

290
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,250
elbow groping, and now arson.

291
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,791
This guy had the same face
and was wearing the same thing

292
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,958
for every incident,
that must mean--

293
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,416
In the Bureau's database search,

294
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,416
there were 152
Dunians who showed up.

295
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,375
Just because they have
the same face and clothes

296
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,166
doesn't necessarily mean
they're the same person, chu.

297
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,250
Anyway, let's check out
the crime scene.

298
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,291
It's possible the suspect could
still be in the vicinity.

299
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,250
[grunts]

300
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,583
[MAN] Hey there, kids.
You got a minute?

301
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,416
Just got a few questions for ya.

302
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,875
You happen to see anyone
suspicious around here?

303
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,000
Only you.

304
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:57,875
[laughs]

305
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,583
You got me there, young lady!

306
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,208
I'm a detective
with the Shizuoka

307
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,416
prefectural police department.

308
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,250
Ya see, there was a
really nasty fire nearby.

309
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,375
Seems like it could be arson,
so we're looking for a suspect.

310
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,166
Well, we don't know anything!

311
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,291
Yes, we were just
passing through.

312
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:18,375
Ah, I see. Well,
that's good, then. Heh.

313
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,750
'Cause they say that criminals

314
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,083
always return to the
scene of the crime.

315
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:25,125
So you kids have some
business here or something?

316
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:28,041
Those are Shirobori Middle
School uniforms, right?

317
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:31,083
That's a long way away
from here, ain't it?

318
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,000
Uh, well...

319
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,833
[DOLUGH]
He suspects you, Chuta.

320
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,625
[CHUTA]
We're, uh--

321
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,833
We're on a date.

322
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,500
Well, well, aren't
you a lucky guy?

323
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,416
So where are you two
lovebirds going on said date?

324
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,625
[MISUZU]
At the movie theater nearby.

325
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,333
Fujiyama Cinema.

326
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:51,083
They're showing a revival of
<i>Adults Just Don't Understand</i> .

327
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,750
Right, Chutiekins?

328
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,750
[screams]

329
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,708
[HIDARU]
A movie revival, eh?

330
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,666
[MISUZU] That's right. My
Chutiekins just loves that one.

331
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,416
[HIDARU]
I see. Well, hold on a sec...

332
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,500
[CHUTA] Her-Her chest.
S-S-Sonokata's chest, it's--!

333
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:07,875
[MISUZU]
Yes, of course.

334
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,166
[DOLUGH] Calm down!
Your heart is beating too fast!

335
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,375
[CHUTA breathing heavily]

336
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,083
How 'bout that? It's
definitely playing there.

337
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,666
[COP A]
Hey, Detective!

338
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,166
I think we found someone
who looks suspicious.

339
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,166
Well, sorry to bother you kids.

340
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,833
Now have a good time, but don't
stay out too late, all right?

341
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,166
[MISUZU]
We won't.

342
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,250
[MISUZU sighs]

343
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,041
[CHIPS]
That was a close one, chu.

344
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,166
Thanks for the quick
movie information.

345
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,833
No problem at all, chu. Hmm...

346
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,250
Is something wrong?

347
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,875
Misuzu, turn around slowly, chu.

348
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,958
It's that face.

349
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,916
[CHIPS] He's wearing a red
hoodie and jeans, too, chu.

350
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,166
Let's box him in, and I'll
come at him from behind.

351
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,375
[CHUTA]
Uh-huh...

352
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,208
C'mon, get ahold
of yourself, Chuta!

353
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,875
[CHUTA] But I can... still
feel her chest on my arm.

354
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,333
You have to lower
your heart rate!

355
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,208
If you don't, you're gonna die!

356
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,166
[CHUTA]
They were so soft.

357
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,250
[DOLUGH] Don't you have
a mission to carry out?

358
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,583
[CHUTA]
Oh, yeah, right.

359
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,416
Hey, look, there's the
suspect right over there.

360
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,333
[CHUTA]
Crap!

361
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,791
This is Kokonose.
The suspect's getting away.

362
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,166
[CHIPS]
What happened, chu?

363
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,416
[CHUTA]
I was kinda out of it.

364
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,833
I'm so sorry!
This was my mistake!

365
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:30,916
[gasps]

366
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,333
I can't let him escape
because of me.

367
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,000
Dolugh, we need wings!

368
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,583
[DOLUGH]
Sympathy!

369
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,166
Hey, Dolugh, speed up!

370
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,833
[DOLUGH]
Sympathy!

371
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,083
We've almost got 'em!

372
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,416
[gasps]

373
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,541
Uh, hey, are you--? I-I didn't--

374
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,333
[CHIPS]
What's going on here, chu?

375
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,083
You move, I'll cut you.

376
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,041
Whoa, SPH.

377
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,416
We're officers of the
Space Police elDLIVE!

378
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,166
You're coming back to
the Bureau with us.

379
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,500
We have a lot of
questions for you.

380
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,250
[WOODY]
I was hoping... you'd say that!

381
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,166
[crying]

382
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,791
Oh, there's so much
that I wanna tell you!

383
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,833
I'm a little confused, chu!

384
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:39,000
[CHUTA] So your intergalactic
passport was stolen?

385
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,458
Yeah, that's right.

386
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,000
And without it,

387
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,041
I had absolutely nothing to
prove that I really am a Dunian,

388
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,625
which meant that I had no
way to report to elDLIVE.

389
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:47,791
So out of desperation,

390
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,500
you panicked and
tried bag snatching,

391
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,166
kidnapping, groping, and arson,

392
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,083
hoping that you'd get
captured by elDLIVE?

393
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,208
Well, mostly. I just want
you to catch the thief!

394
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,208
The guy who took it was
some weird Earthling

395
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,083
who was at this mixer with me.

396
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,291
[CHUTA]
Earthling?

397
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,708
[NINOTCHKA] Care to tell us what
this is all about, Mr. Marukobi?

398
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,875
Aw, man.

399
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,291
I guess the jig is up.

400
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,416
And just when things

401
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,000
were starting to get
interesting, too.

402
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,875
'Kay, let's start with why you
decided to steal the passport.

403
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,500
Well, it all began when I was
mistaken for somebody else,

404
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,125
and then got taken to a mixer.

405
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:22,166
I soon found out that everyone
there besides me was an alien,

406
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,666
and needless to say,
I was pretty surprised.

407
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,458
So I borrowed one
of their passports

408
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,958
and then researched a
bunch of cool stuff.

409
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,625
After that, I felt like
a badass hero

410
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,583
in a sci-fi movie or something!

411
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,250
I always knew there had
to be some good reason

412
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,375
I was born with this face!

413
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,416
And finally, it paid
off! Oh, yeah!

414
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,458
Discovering there are aliens
disguised as humans is huge!

415
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,666
And then I found out
that Space Police exist,

416
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,250
and that's even huger!

417
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,250
[CHIPS]
Well, that case is closed, chu.

418
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,125
Uh, thanks, Sonokata,
for earlier.

419
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,416
I mean, we almost lost
the suspect back there

420
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,250
'cause I dropped the ball.

421
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,375
So thanks a lot.

422
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,625
Uh. It was nothing.

423
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,458
[CHUTA]
Hm? I wonder what's wrong.

424
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,875
Normally, she'd be saying
something really mean to me

425
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,541
right about now.

426
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,000
[MISUZU]
Psychogenic?

427
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,500
Yes, that's right.

428
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,333
I think perhaps you panicked
a little when you saw Chuta

429
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,416
beginning to show
signs of maturing.

430
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,250
He managed to solve a case
without you around to help,

431
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,166
so you felt some
anxiety about the fact

432
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,750
that Chuta no longer needed you,

433
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,750
and your sense of dread
affected your sense of smell.

434
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,500
What? But that's insane.

435
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,875
Is there any evidence
to back all this up?

436
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:30,583
[LOVE]
Yes.

437
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:31,625
[MISUZU yelps]

438
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:32,625
You pervert!

439
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,291
[LOVE]
Oh, right, sorry.

440
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,875
As it turns out,

441
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,666
as soon as Officer Kokonose
slipped up today,

442
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,250
the SPH curtain stopped working.

443
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,166
[gasps]

444
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,583
That's right.

445
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,541
You were able to tolerate
his scent all on your own,

446
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,750
without help from
the SPH curtain.

447
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,458
My theory is that
your anxiety subsided

448
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,750
as soon as he was
found to be an error,

449
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,291
which then caused
your sense of smell

450
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,833
to return back to
normal after that.

451
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:57,958
No way.

452
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,250
[LOVE]
It's the undeniable truth.

453
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:04,208
Which means that this was
all my fault the whole time.

454
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,083
Worse, somewhere deep
down in my heart,

455
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:09,208
I was rooting for Officer
Kokonose to fail.

456
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,541
I'm...

457
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,416
I'm just the worst!

458
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,333
[crying]

459
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,791
[LOVE]
You've got the wrong idea.

460
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,875
You weren't actually hoping that
your partner would do poorly.

461
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,958
What caused your anxiety
was a frustration with yourself.

462
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,833
As you sat there watching
Chuta mature by your side,

463
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,791
your urge to mature
yourself just intensified.

464
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,500
It's a completely
natural response.

465
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,000
Besides, Chuta can
be so mysterious,

466
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:39,708
what with his ability to somehow
lift up those around him.

467
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,250
[LOVE]
That's right.

468
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,333
And I can give you proof
that you don't actually

469
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,750
want Officer Kokonose to fail.

470
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,333
I imagine you're still
getting just a hint

471
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:50,166
of that bad odor
from him, right?

472
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,583
I thought the device
couldn't completely mask it.

473
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,583
If that were caused by
someone else's failure,

474
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,833
there'd be nothing you could do.

475
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,291
This is a scent that only
your own growth can change.

476
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,666
It may entirely
disappear someday,

477
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,125
or perhaps instead it will
become as comforting to you

478
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:09,583
as the smell of that
grassy field back home.

479
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,250
Hey, Misuzu.

480
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,875
I just received a
report from Chips

481
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,750
about the arson investigation.

482
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,166
Nice job.

483
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,958
Thanks, Chief Laine.

484
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,125
Well, just keep
up the good work.

485
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,833
Yoyosa!

486
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,458
[LAINE]
Oh, by the way.

487
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,000
That new hairpin,
I think it really suits you.

488
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,333
Nice statement.

489
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,583
I question your sense
of style, Chief.

490
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,250
Ah, and there it is.

491
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,958
There's some of that
trademark Misuzu attitude!

492
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,083
[laughing]

493
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:47,375
[MISUZU] So Officer Kokonose's
foul stench was all in my head.

494
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:51,791
[LAINE]
I'm counting on you.

495
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,208
Yoyosa!

496
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,375
[door opens]

497
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,583
[LAINE]
Oh?

498
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,458
Ah, you're here.

499
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,125
[TONTO]
Chief Laine!

500
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,333
The Red Bean Paste Mochi
Galaxy lies ahead of us!

501
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,291
[LAINE]
What? This is an emergency!

502
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,833
We have to eat it all
before it goes bad! Oh, man!

503
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:45,416
[DOLUGH] Next time on
<i>elDLIVE</i> : "Your Voice..."

504
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,000
[LAINE]
It was only a dream.
