1
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:13,458
Officer Kokonose,
we were worried about you.

2
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:14,875
Where have you been, chu?

3
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:16,541
Sorry I'm late.

4
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,833
[ALIEN A] I heard DeMille's
after some brat.

5
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,583
Goes by the name
of Chuta Kokonose.

6
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:24,333
If you ask me, we should
just hand him over.

7
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,166
Gimme a break.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,750
Ya really think that DeMille's
gonna keep their promise

9
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:31,541
and leave us alone
after we give 'em this kid?

10
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,583
[door opens]

11
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,041
[ALIEN A]
Hey, they're from--

12
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:36,708
[ALIEN B]
DeMille.

13
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,208
We have reason to believe

14
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,958
that the Monitalien and its
host are hiding out here.

15
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,416
[DEMILLE SOLDIER B] It'll be bad
news for anyone helping them.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,875
Monitalien? What are
you talking about?

17
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:49,625
How did DeMille manage
to find us here, chu?

18
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:52,625
Seems like it happened
a little too fast.

19
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,125
Huff and puff all you want,

20
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:56,875
but even if we knew where they
were, we wouldn't tell ya.

21
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,083
What did you say?

22
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,875
[GUILLERMO]
Get the hell outta here.

23
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,750
That's what happens
when you defy us.

24
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,041
You bastard!

25
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,375
[CHUTA]
I'm right here!

26
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:07,916
No, don't!

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,166
Those guys have nothing to do
with this. Leave 'em alone!

28
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,166
Ah, so you're Kokonose.

29
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,583
How nice of you to make our
job easy by coming forward.

30
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:20,541
Yeah, well, I don't plan on
being all that cooperative.

31
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,541
I'm an officer of elDLIVE.

32
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:25,708
It's my sworn duty to
protect everyone here!

33
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:29,958
And how are you going to
protect them all by yourself?

34
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:33,458
The thing is, he's
not here by himself.

35
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:34,875
Sonokata!

36
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,666
Stay where you are!

37
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,333
[VEGA]
That's enough.

38
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,250
Miss Sonokata.

39
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,791
Vega?

40
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,583
The nature and origin
of the flying objects

41
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:59,791
that have appeared in the sky
remain a mystery to authorities.

42
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,500
But we have reports
of similar incidents

43
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,208
occurring all around the world.

44
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,041
Chuta.

45
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,541
[LAINE] Any movement
from the DeMille ship?

46
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,875
No signs of it coming
after us, sir.

47
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,208
Well, in our current condition,

48
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,416
we aren't going to be
able to get very far.

49
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,708
It looks like they've got
us all figured out.

50
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,166
[grunts]

51
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,833
[CHIPS] Inspector Vega,
what are you doing?

52
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:23,916
[yells]

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,791
Vega, what's going on?

54
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,791
[VEGA] While investigating
the mysterious message

55
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:31,083
he received, Chuta Kokonose
wound up infecting

56
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,583
the Jeanrenoi-R's
system with a virus,

57
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,166
thereby putting all of
planet Earth in jeopardy.

58
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,583
Poor guy couldn't handle
all the guilt anymore and--

59
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,541
Here's what you were supposed
to be thinking right now:

60
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:45,041
"If I hand myself over to
DeMille, everyone will be okay."

61
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,416
In fact, I'm pretty
sure that thought's

62
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,375
already run through your mind.

63
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,833
But why?

64
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,708
[VEGA]
And to think...

65
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,416
...that's exactly how you
would've acted, too.

66
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,916
But if you've gone off script,
we need to rewrite the scenario.

67
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,750
Sonokata, what are--?

68
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,916
Ugh, are you still
not getting it?

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,166
It's Vega. He's the one
who's working for DeMille.

70
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,083
[gasps]

71
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,500
So Vega works... for DeMille?

72
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,875
Oh, no.

73
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,750
[DOLUGH]
"elDLIVE is compromised.

74
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,333
One of its members
is a DeMille spy.

75
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:30,833
Be careful, Chuta.
Because that spy person is--"

76
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,416
[CHUTA]
Vega. This can't be true.

77
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,458
You can't be a spy. How
could you trick me like that?

78
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,250
[VEGA] You and Dolugh will
be coming to DeMille.

79
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,416
If you try to resist,
I'll be forced to hurt you.

80
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,666
At least as much as I
can without killing you.

81
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,750
[MISUZU groans]

82
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,666
Chuta.

83
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,208
[CHUTA]
He's gone.

84
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,500
[VEGA]
Hm?

85
00:03:56,583 --> 00:04:00,250
I mean Dolugh. He's gone.

86
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,875
What are you talking about?

87
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:06,083
[CHUTA]
Dolugh has... vanished.

88
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,916
He's no longer within
me. He's gone.

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,375
[VEGA] Are you actually
trying to bluff me here?

90
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,125
We'll find out soon enough
when we examine you.

91
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:20,083
Look, if you wanna take me,
that's fine, go ahead.

92
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,083
Assuming I still have
any worth left.

93
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:25,375
Without Dolugh
inside me, that is.

94
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,708
You know, you're really
throwing a wrench

95
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,416
into my plans
with this business.

96
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,541
I'll give you 30 minutes.

97
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,166
You have till then to do
whatever you gotta do

98
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,541
to get Dolugh back
and bring him here.

99
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,583
If you don't, then
everybody will die.

100
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,666
[CHUTA]
Sonokata, are you okay?

101
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,333
Yes.

102
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:51,125
But more importantly right now,
is that true about Dolugh?

103
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,000
[GUILLERMO]
Hey, kid.

104
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:56,000
You're one tough son of
a gun, did you know that?

105
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,500
Come any closer,
and I swear, I'll attack.

106
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,625
Oh, cool your jets. We are
not your enemy, little lady.

107
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:05,083
Now, is there anything we can
do to help you guys out?

108
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,666
Is Vega really part of DeMille?

109
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,666
No way! We worked
together in investigations.

110
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,875
It's impossible!

111
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,708
No, Inspector Vega is
a member of DeMille.

112
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,083
There's no question.

113
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,291
He attacked us just now, chu!

114
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,375
Really? But how?

115
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,791
We also have reason to believe

116
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,416
he's the one who
sent that email.

117
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,250
The one that led to
Officer Kokonose

118
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,541
infecting the Bureau's
system with that virus.

119
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,083
But wait, I was
under the impression

120
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,958
that all DeMille
personnel had a recorder

121
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,958
and a bomb planted
inside of them.

122
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,833
I never detected
anything like that

123
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,833
in Inspector Vega's
body that I know of.

124
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,708
[RIGGS]
We checked out his family, too.

125
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,708
There were no connections
to any criminal organizations.

126
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,208
Of course not. I happen to
know his father quite well.

127
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,916
In fact, he was once a highly
respected elDLIVE detective.

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,875
So nothing suspicious
about him, huh?

129
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,125
How could he be a spy

130
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,583
with a perfectly spotless
record like that?

131
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,500
Well, of course
he's squeaky clean.

132
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,166
What's that mean, Doctor Love?

133
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,875
Do you really think
a crime syndicate

134
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,708
infiltrating the police
would send a shady spy

135
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,916
who might set off all
kinds of alarm bells?

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,166
Yeah, good point.

137
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,208
It is possible Vega might
even have been " <i>kusa</i> ."

138
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,708
<i>Kusa</i> ?

139
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,916
[LOVE] During the Warring
States Period in Japan,

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,208
there were <i>shinobi</i> known
as <i>kusa</i> , or grass.

141
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,333
After sneaking into
enemy territory,

142
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,750
they would blend in with the
local farmers, create families,

143
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,750
and then pass their mission
on down to their children.

144
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:38,291
It's possible that not only was
his father a spy, but also,

145
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,916
one of his grandparents
could've been as well.

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,583
That fate may've been bequeathed
onto Vega's generation.

147
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,291
So it's like a ticking time bomb

148
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,666
was planted into
elDLIVE years ago.

149
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,458
To think, Inspector Vega
was-- I can't believe it!

150
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,541
I feel the same way as you.

151
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,166
However, the fact is,
he's betrayed elDLIVE,

152
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,541
and now the planet Earth
is in serious danger.

153
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,416
[CHUTA]
I can't forgive Vega.

154
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,708
[LAINE]
Chuta.

155
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,666
I want to arrest Vega
and make him pay.

156
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,916
And even more than that,
I want to protect the Earth.

00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,250
Protect everybody!

158
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,708
Uh, why are you
stating the obvious?

159
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,500
That's right, Chuta.

160
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:25,083
Everyone here feels the exact
same way. I promise you.

161
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,625
Yeah, she's right, chu!

162
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,916
We're Space Police elDLIVE,

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,750
that's pretty much
what we do, chu!

164
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,791
Chips tells it like
it is, right, Chief?

165
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,291
Well, naturally.

166
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,791
Now then,

167
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,583
the only question is how we
ought to be approaching this

168
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,041
given how severely outgunned
we are at the moment.

169
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,250
Let's see.

170
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,750
I actually might have
an idea about that.

171
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:44,916
[LAINE]
Oh, yes?

172
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,333
Listen up.

173
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,125
[DEMILLE SUBORDINATE A]
So I take it you weren't able

174
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,833
to capture the Monitalien?

175
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,750
Yeah, sorry about that.

176
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,416
But Chuta Kokonose told
me it had vanished.

177
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,958
I guess you're a miserable
little spy after all.

178
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,333
Doesn't really matter.

179
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,916
Either way, that planet will
soon be a sea of flames.

180
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,458
[chuckles]

181
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,625
And I for one can't
wait to see it.

182
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:13,000
The sight of those Earthlings
scurrying around, terrified.

183
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,958
[LAINE] All personnel,
report to battle stations!

184
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,791
We'll commence our attack
on the DeMille ship shortly.

185
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,875
All civilians and
anyone with injuries

186
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,916
should get to safety
immediately!

187
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,833
Everybody who can fight,
check your equipment

188
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,875
and stand by for further orders!

189
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,750
[RIGGS]
But are you sure this will work?

190
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,458
I mean, using those guys?

191
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,708
There are aliens holding
grudges against DeMille

192
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,000
who are in hiding all
over Planet Earth.

193
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,416
And their numbers are great.

194
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,041
Those DeMille bastards!

195
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,958
Today's the day I'm finally
gonna show 'em who's boss!

196
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,708
If they help us out,
then by gosh,

197
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,750
we might just have a chance at
actually winning this fight!

198
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,250
Though no matter what,

199
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,250
I'm probably still gonna have
to write a formal apology.

200
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,458
Chief Laine!

201
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,500
Chuta, welcome back.

202
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,750
Please, you've gotta
let me fight, too!

203
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,583
It's too dangerous now that
you don't have Dolugh anymore.

204
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,375
Yeah, I know that.

205
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,375
But with all that Vega has done,

206
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,500
I really want to be able to
settle this with him myself!

207
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,166
Honestly, you'll
just be in the way.

208
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,041
But if I were to receive a
direct order from the Chief,

209
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,166
well then,

210
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,875
I suppose I would
have no objections

211
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,375
to backing up Officer Kokonose.

212
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,708
We're all part of

Here, take it.

What's this?

216
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,416
Hah. That is a special
gun that's capable

217
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,708
of shooting out SPH energy.

218
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,166
Figure you could use
that right aout now.

219

316
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,625
Let's say you don't give up,
what happens after that?

317
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,500
[CHUTA] I'm gonna
beat... the bad guys..

318
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,375
...and save the people
important to me!

319
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:30,041
[VEGA] You think you can have
both? How greedy of you.

320
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,375
Yeah, well, you may be right.

321
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,041
But I do know one thing.

322
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,208
I am not going to regret it!

323
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:41,875
I wanna eat pasta, curry,
and hamburger steak!

324
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,916
I don't wanna pick just one!

325
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,541
Besides, I know I'm
gonna end up regretting

326
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,125
just picking one of those dishes

327
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,041
so I should keep all the
options on the table,

328
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,666
and just prepare all
of those dishes!

329
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,916
Officer Kokonose.

330
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,125
[CHUTA] But to regret
not doing something?

331
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:12,250
That's something... that I...

332
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:18,791
...never, ever...
want to do... again!

333
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,333
[DOLUGH]
Sympathy!

334
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,250
Dolugh!

335
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,708
You know, eating pasta,
curry, and hamburger steak

336
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,958
would definitely be
eating too much, Chuta.

337
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:33,958
Nah.

338
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,416
If I can't finish it all myself,

339
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,791
then I'll just share some
with the neighbors,

340
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,583
it's as simple as that.

341
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,916
[gasps] Officer Kokonose!

342
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:47,041
I'm happy to see that
Dolugh has finally returned.

343
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,416
Now I can take you
both to DeMille.

344
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,583
Like hell I'll let you do that!

345
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,791
Unfortunately for you,

346
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,166
I don't really care what
you feel like doing.

347
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,083
I will complete my mission here

348
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:03,708
and continue living as
a member of DeMille!

349
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,833
That's just wrong!

350
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:10,333
No matter what the cause!

351
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,916
The duck!

352
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,791
Here, Kokonose, take this!

353
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,500
Sonokata.

354
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,708
I'm entrusting
everything to you now.

355
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,958
Let's arrest Inspector Vega
so we can lock him away forever!

356
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,250
Yeah!

357
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,666
Let's get this over with, Chuta.

358
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,041
Chuta, I'm near my limit here!

359
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,208
Let's end this once and for all!

360
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,166
Here goes, Dolugh!

361
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:47,458
[yells]

362
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,541
You're done!

363
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,333
Chuta!

364
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,000
Kokonose!

365
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,208
[yells]

366
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,875
[ALL]
Sympathy!

367
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,208
Where'd this power come from?

00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,666
[ALL yelling]

369
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,458
I won't give up!

370
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,875
Hey! I'm trying to flee!

371
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:13,958
But, Junior--

372
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,333
This sets a bad
example for the crew!

373
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,708
[VERONICA]
Ah, found ya!

374
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:19,833
We're elDLIVE.

375
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,708
You're goin' down, guys!

376
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,791
[yells]

377
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:30,750
At least I'll finally be
liberated from this torture.

378
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,750
Vega, no! No!

379
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:36,875
And I can finally
be... at peace.

380
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:43,416
I don't want to lose
anyone else ever again!

381
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,791
Chuta.

382
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,083
But why would you save me?

383
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,333
I am not just gonna
let you die here!

384
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:00,500
[BOTH] You'll atone for every
bad thing you've done.

385
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,250
Chuta, Misuzu, you all right?

386
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,333
This is Officer
Kokonose reporting.

387
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,791
We're safe and sound.

388
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,541
I see. Nicely done!

389
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,625
[MIMI]
Here ya go!

390
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,458
Freshly baked muffins!

391
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,708
Oh, yeah! Score!

392
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:30,833
Skaa!

393
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,375
Aw, thank you so much!

394
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,500
They look great!

395
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:37,541
[chattering]

396
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,791
Everyone's lives are
back to normal now.

397
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,708
It's a good thing that
Vega and his family

398
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,041
have been secured by
elDLIVE, huh, Chuta?

399
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,875
It's all because the Chief
put in a request to HQ.

400
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,708
[MISUZU clears throat]

401
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:53,083
Kokonose. I, um, I'm so sorry.

402
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,250
About the whole bad smell
thing the other day.

403
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,833
What smell thing?

404
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,958
So then I guess you just weren't
misunderstanding her after all.

405
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,208
Uh, well, now I've
properly apologized,

406
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,166
so if you'll excuse me...

407
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,500
What are those two
whispering about now?

408
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,500
Are they having a super
intense private conversation?

409
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,958
I'm fascinated.

410
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,041
[LOVE]
Mmm, I'm fascinated.

411
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,875
By your flesh.

00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,083
[VERONICA]
Kopniecie!

413
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,583
[RIGGS]
We being too carefree?

414
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,000
I mean, we aren't even done
with the ship's repairs yet.

415
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:23,458
Oh, come on. Today's all
about celebrating Chuta.

416
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:24,916
That's right,

417
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and because Officer Kokonose
arrested Inspector Vega...

418
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,333
...we were in the end
ultimately able to...

419
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,083
...acquire valuable
SPH information

420
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,750
that we can use to take
down DeMille, so--

421
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,458
Man, I didn't know
what we were gonna do

422
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,208
when that virus hit, but I gotta
say, I was pretty worried.

423
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,083
[MCCLANE]
Yeah, I know!

424
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:45,125
[ALL laughing]

425
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,416
[CHUTA]
Hey, you got a minute?

426
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,458
It feels like we always end up

427
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,291
fighting with each
other, you know?

428
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,791
And never really just talking.

429
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:01,166
But I wanna thank
you for everything.

430
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,000
I still remember, you told me
that as an officer of elDLIVE,

431
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,583
I could help protect the
Earth from danger.

432
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:11,958
I think that that was what
inspired me to work so hard.

433
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,500
And yet, as usual,

434
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,875
your actions were reckless,
poorly thought through,

435
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,875
and without anything remotely
resembling strategy.

436
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,125
Even your decision to save
Inspector Vega's life,

437
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:25,083
while humane, I can't say it
was the right call to make.

438
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,583
That being said,

439
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:30,083
it is true that everything
worked out all right in the end.

440
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,208
So now, Officer Kokonose,
I suppose I can finally say

441
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,500
that I approve of you
joining elDLIVE.

442
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,416
Wait, finally?

443
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,583
Does that mean
that all this time

444
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,416
you disapproved of me joining?

445
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,000
Good for you, Chuta.

446
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,791
It is not good at all!

00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:48,916
I can't believe
my little Chuta's

[CHUTA]
Ever since I joined elDLIVE,

454
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,291
so many crazy things
have happened.

455
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:05,166
There's plenty of stuff that I
still don't fully understand,

456
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,541
but I know that I'll keep
trying as hard as I can.

457
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:12,500
If that's what it takes to
protect everyone's smiles.
