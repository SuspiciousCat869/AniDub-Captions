1
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,541
All right, switch it up, girls!

2
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,416
[SHIZU] You've got serious
tennis skills, Misuzu.

3
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,750
Yeah, a normal middle-schooler

4
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,625
would've never been
able to hit that ball.

5
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,166
That was just an average volley

6
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,500
for anybody who's played tennis
for a minimum of 12 months.

7
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,875
[TOKU chuckles]

8
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,708
[TOKU] Oh, man,
that's hilarious, Misuzu.

9
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,833
Eww, those guys
keep staring at Misuzu

10
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,625
and slobbering like she's
a juicy piece of meat.

11
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,291
Ugh, they're such
perverts, aren't they?

12
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,208
[CHUTA]
Uh?

13
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,166
[CHUTA yelps]

14
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,916
Is something going on with
you and Chuta, Misuzu?

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,333
[MISUZU]
Why do you ask?

16
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,500
'Cause you guys just made
some serious eye contact.

17
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,333
The reason I was staring at him

18
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,083
is that I was trying to make
him disappear into thin air.

19
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,250
[TOKU chuckles]

20
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,583
You're funny!

21
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,083
[TOKU, SHIZU laughing]

22
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,083
What's she laughing at?
Is she laughing at me?

23
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,916
If so, that's really
kinda mean of her.

24
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,250
Misuzu? What is she...?

25
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,583
Why is...?

26
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,916
Misuzu is a vital
part of the force.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,250
I've had her observing
you for a while.

28
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,125
Wait a second,
she's been spying on me?

29
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,916
Look, Chief, I am
still against this.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,083
[CHUTA]
Uh?

31
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,083
Just as I reported earlier,

32
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,166
he's not qualified
to be an officer.

33
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,458
Yes, I know you did.

34
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,000
But he wasn't
talking to himself,

35
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,875
he was talking to a Monitalien.

36
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,166
So he's not crazy.

37
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,541
No, see, there's a much
bigger problem with him.

38
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:18,583
Namely, the fact that
he's a raging pervert.

39
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,291
Chuta Kokonose is
a sick individual.

40
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,333
I suspect his every waking
thought burns with depravity.

41
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,916
And this isn't just some
endearing quirk that will--

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Well, just do your best.

43
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,791
Just like Misuzu and Chips do
every day in Division Two.

44
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,375
Think you can handle that?

45
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,333
Oh, sure.

46
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,958
Who'd have thought that
she would turn out to be

47
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,750
a Space Police officer?

48
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,083
[TATEYAN]
Isn't it beautiful?

49
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,625
Girls' tennis, I mean.

50
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,666
Tateyan?

51
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,000
Oh, yeah, I wanna go
over there, too.

52
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:49,166
[CHUTA] He doesn't seem
to remember what happened.

53
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,125
Then again, everything
that happened yesterday

54
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:56,208
was so unbelievable,
maybe he thinks it was a dream.

55
00:03:56,291 --> 00:04:00,125
Wait, I almost forgot the most
unbelievable part of it all!

56
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,958
Oh, wow, that Misuzu really
hates your guts, Chuta.

57
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,250
[CHUTA]
Ah! There it is!

58
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,833
Hey, what's wrong, Chuta? Are
you talking to yourself again?

59
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,000
Huh? What? Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah!

60
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,166
There's nothing down my shirt,

61
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,791
so don't worry about it,
everything's okay!

62
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,375
[STUDENT D]
Think fast!

63
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,000
[wheezes]

64
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:23,041
That had to hurt!
You okay, Chuta?

65
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,250
Okay, I'm going to
head out for a bit.

66
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,083
Make sure to get some rest.

67
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,833
[CHUTA]
Yes, ma'am.

68
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,916
[CHUTA]
She's gone.

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,541
[VOICE]
Yeah, she is.

70
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,666
Oh, come on!
You're still stuck to me?

71
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,791
Huh, I must've fallen asleep.

72
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,416
Materializing into this form

73
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,208
uses up an unimaginable
amount of energy, you know.

74
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,583
No, I don't!

75
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:48,916
But of course that crazy voice

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,458
belonged to something
as weird as you!

77
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,666
Just what in the heck
are you, anyway?

78
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,125
well, I happen to be a
fourth generation Monitalien.

79
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,208
A water planet support-type
Dolughbritt type 39.

80
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,833
Nope. Your name is way too long.

81
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,041
"Dolugh" should be
more than enough.

82
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,083
Hm?

83
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,666
[screams]

84
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,333
[DOLUGH] Dolugh? Dolugh,
Dolugh, Dolugh, Dolugh!

85
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,791
Dolugh!

86
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:12,583
I like it.

87
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,083
[CHUTA groans]

88
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,958
Hey, wait, I just
thought of something.

89
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,708
That embarrassing failure
when I was a kid,

90
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,583
the horrifying experience that
left me scarred for life...

91
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,250
It was all your fault!

92
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,833
You give me back my youth!

93
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,666
Actually, you know, age-wise,
your youth is just beginning.

94
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,958
Don't "actually" me!
Just get out!

95
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,541
That's a bad idea, Chuta.

96
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,666
Why can't I breathe now?

97
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,000
That's because you
and I are one, Chuta.

98
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,833
So if I'm suffering, then
you're going to suffer, too.

99
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,750
Then how am I supposed
to pull you out?

100
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,875
Oh, silly Chuta, you can't
remove me until after you die.

101
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,208
This can't be!

102
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,791
You mean I have to
live like this forever?

103
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,000
Listen, when I look down

104
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,625
I only wanna see
my weiner dangling!

105
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:59,125
[CHUTA] Did she hear me,
or... am I safe?

106
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:02,291
Such vulgar words. You really
are quite the pervert.

107
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,833
Oh! Of course she heard me!

108
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:05,958
[MISUZU]
We have the night shift.

109
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,458
Uh? What? Oh, you
mean for elDLIVE?

110
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,458
Of course, what else is there?

111
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,083
Unless you'd rather just quit.

112
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:15,458
Wait, you mean I'm
allowed to quit?

113
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,916
Certainly.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,333
Feel free to run away with
your tail between your legs.

115
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:24,333
In fact, you shouldn't be afraid
to completely disappear forever.

116
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,583
Hey, don't say that!
It's not nice!

117
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,541
And besides, we can't leave
right now, we have classes.

118
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,666
None of my concern.

119
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,000
Even if I were the president

120
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,958
and it meant missing an
international summit,

121
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,125
I would still show up
for my shift at elDLIVE.

122
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,583
Yep. That made no sense to me.

123
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,416
[MISUZU] Because you lack
comprehension skills.

124
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,958
[growls]

125
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,333
But have it your way.

126
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,833
I'll tell the Chief you have
class and can't make it.

127
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,041
[CHUTA]
What?

128
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh, man, that girl
is so annoying.

129
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,166
Hey, Chuta, aren't you
gonna go with Misuzu?

130
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,041
Whoa, don't just
jump out like that!

131
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,916
Come on, we're gonna
be late for elDLIVE!

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,250
We can't be late our first day!

133
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,000
Sheesh, calm down, Dolugh.

134
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,125
Why do you wanna go
so badly, anyway?

135
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,250
I'm curious.

136
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,625
[CHUTA]
Huh?

137
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,958
We Monitaliens were created
to gather information.

138
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,875
You see, we're designed
to be curious.

139
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,000
And what does that
have to do with me?

140
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,416
Does that mean you're not going?

141
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,625
Well, even though I
still don't really get

142
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,041
the whole Space Police thing,

143
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,250
I don't like
Sonokata mocking me.

144
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,416
I'll show her what I lack.

145
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,208
Wait, hold on, why'd she say
it was the night shift?

146
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,166
It's the middle of the day.

147
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,583
[DOLUGH] Yesterday, when we were
in space, it was dark out.

148
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,583
Maybe space's day and night
are the opposite of Earth's.

149
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,458
[CHUTA]
Ah, good point.

150
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,791
Uh? Where'd Sonokata go?

151
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:46,083
Coulda sworn I saw
her come this way.

152
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,916
[VOICE]
Over here, chu.

153
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,833
[CHUTA]
Huh?

154
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,125
Hi, I am Inspector Chips, chu.

155
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:55,333
Now hurry up and get in, chu!

156
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,625
Where are we?

157
00:07:56,708 --> 00:08:00,208
This place is one of
elDLIVE's Earth branches.

158
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,916
[CHUTA]
But there's nothing in here.

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,291
It only exists so we can
transfer to the station

160
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,833
without being detected.

161
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,500
You're actually showing up
for your shift? Are you sure?

162
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,958
Yeah, I mean,
if that's okay with you.

163
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:15,000
Right, here we go, chu!

164
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,416
Particle changes in the
target confirmed, chu.

165
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,791
And now, people, we are
go for transfer, chu!

166
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,166
[SHERONIMO]
Leave it to me, Chief.

167
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,375
Shero!

168
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,416
[CHIPS] Darn it.
Upside down again, chu.

169
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,166
C'mon, get it together, Transfer
Administrator Sheronimo.

170
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:35,500
[CHUTA] Huh, it's pretty
quiet in here today.

171
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,375
That's 'cause daytime staff
is off right now, chu.

172
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,416
Oh, right, it is
the night shift.

173
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,625
[LAINE]
I've been waiting for you.

174
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,541
[CHUTA]
Huh? Chief Laine?

175
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,583
Yeah.

176
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,916
Chuta Kokonose and
the Monitalien.

177
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,375
[CHUTA]
Uhh...

178
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,500
Uh, hey, so, I, um--

179
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,708
Oh, no, Chief, no!
You can't sleep here!

180
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,791
[CHUTA] How can he just
fall asleep like that?

181
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,500
Um, Chips, stand by the bridge.

182
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:18,125
And, Misuzu, you give Chuta
a tour of the Bureau.

183
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,500
[ALL]
Yoyosa!

184
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,250
[MISUZU] Space Police elDLIVE's
Bureau in this solar system

185
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,458
is this spaceship,
the Jeanrenoi-R.

186
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,583
The space ship's advanced tech,

187
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,333
developed by the
el Civilization,

188
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,208
will one day be used on Earth.

189
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,583
Oh, I see.

190
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,875
For instance, there are
virus-like translation chips

191
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,375
operating onboard the ship.

192
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,666
And once you breathe them in,

193
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,875
you're able to communicate
with the alien crew.

194
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,458
And this is the sick bay.

195
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,291
Doctor Isaac is the
one who runs it.

196
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,583
[ISAAC]
Mh-hm.

197
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,083
[CHUTA]
Hi.

198
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,125
Here's the transfer
operations room.

199
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,375
Meet Second Class
Officer Sheronimo.

200
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,958
Nice to meet you, shero.

201
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,416
[CHUTA]
So you're the transfer guy, huh?

202
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,666
This is the interrogation room.

203
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,250
This is the SPH research office.

204
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,916
[CHUTA]
SP-- What now?

205
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,375
And this is the area where
we've been assigned to work.

206
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:12,458
The Investigations Department.

207
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,750
There are six divisions
in the department.

208
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:19,416
You, Investigator Chips, and I
are assigned to Division Two.

209
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,541
So that must mean there
are a lot more people here

210
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,125
besides just you
and Chips, then.

211
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes, 20 of us work in the
Investigation Department.

212
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,583
That many?

213
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,250
[MISUZU] Our boss in Division
Two is Section Chief Madigan.

214
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,625
He rarely shows his face,
but when he does,

215
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,916
it'd probably be in your
best interest to run.

216
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,041
What does that mean?

217
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,125
Now we're in the
detention center.

218
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,250
Like a jail?

219
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,666
A temporary one.

220
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,958
Right now, the Chabrolian you
helped capture yesterday

221
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,208
is being held in here.

222
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,250
[CHUTA]
Huh?

223
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,208
Whoa. You're right.

224
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:53,000
That's the thing that
used to be Miss Saotome.

225
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,333
Hey, I was wondering,

226
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,375
do the criminals here ever
get the death penalty?

227
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,166
[MISUZU] Intergalactic law
prioritizes rehabilitation.

228
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,708
In most cases, offenders
are reintegrated.

229
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,750
Wow, so even hardened
criminals get a second chance.

230
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,458
That's a nice system.

231
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,250
Oh, yeah, and what
would you know about it?

232
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,208
Uh, so...

233
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,416
Um, uh, so, uh...

234
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,750
[DOLUGH]
Ooh, Misuzu's mad.

235
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,083
Hey, I, uh--

236
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,250
Do you mind if I wander around

237
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,000
and explore the Bureau
by myself a bit?

238
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,666
[CHUTA]
Hm...

239
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,375
Man, this place really is big.

240
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,625
Misuzu sure was in a bad mood.

241
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,833
Yeah, well, you know, Sonokata
always seems to be mad at me

242
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,416
for some reason or another.

243
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,541
Yeah, and you seem to get upset
easily where Misuzu's concerned.

244
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,708
I don't know why, but
whenever I talk to that girl,

245
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,708
she just makes me feel
so flipping annoyed.

246
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:54,958
Every time.

247
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,791
Guess maybe it might
have something to do

248
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,833
with the fact that when
I first saw Sonokata,

249
00:11:58,916 --> 00:11:59,666
I thought she was cute.

250
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,750
[DOLUGH]
Chuta.

251
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,541
Where in the heck are we?

252
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,708
Where? Let's see,
we're in the, uh...

253
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:10,416
Wait, hold on. Are we lost?

254
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,041
Oh, no, this isn't good.

255
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,583
It's just gonna make Sonokata
even angrier at me.

256
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,916
[SYSTEM VOICE A]
This is a Code Seven alert!

257
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,208
A Code Seven alert...

258
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,458
Hold on. Did I take a
wrong turn somewhere?

259
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,541
Did she say "escaped"?

260
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,666
[SHERONIMO]
Halt!

261
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,166
[SHERONIMO yells]

262
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,833
Shero!

263
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,583
Huh? What now?

264
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,875
[SYSTEM VOICE A] ...an escaped
suspect is headed...

265
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,625
Sonokata! Wait!

266
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,291
That's where Transfer
Room Two is.

267
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,833
Officer Sheronimo.

268
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,333
Please forgive me.

269
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:08,333
The one who got out was the
notorious criminal Dragline.

270
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:12,875
He transferred himself, shero.
He was headed to Earth, shero.

271
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:13,750
Our Earth?

272
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,375
[MISUZU]
I'll go after him.

273
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,625
Go after him?

274
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,916
[MISUZU] I'm the only
one who can right now.

275
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,041
Is the transfer unit
still operational?

276
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,541
Let me check, shero.

277
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,250
You're not going
after him, Chuta?

278
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,291
Didn't you hear?
He's a vicious criminal.

279
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,916
You gonna make Misuzu
go by herself?

280
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,958
Well, I guess I can
help track him down.

281
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,625
I mean, I'm sure the other
Space Police officers

282
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:38,958
will follow soon.

283
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,333
Don't bother coming if
you're gonna be so naive.

284
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,208
Jeez, you sound like
a middle-schooler.

285
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,541
[yelps]

286
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,958
Well, maybe that's because
I am a middle-schooler!

287
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,541
[MISUZU] Whenever you're
ready, Officer Sheronimo.

288
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,666
All good, shero.

289
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,875
Hey, wait for me!

290
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,000
Shero!

291
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,333
[CHUTA]
Ow!

292
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:59,958
We're upside down again!
"All good, shero," my ass.

293
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,375
Uh, where are we?

294
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,208
Near the local branch.

295
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,541
Must not have changed
the coordinates

296
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,875
from when we transported
to the Bureau.

297
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,791
I wonder where he is.

298
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,291
Our fugitive Dragline's
an alien from Rosenber.

299
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,125
He was initially arrested
after committing

300
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,416
three separate indiscriminate
killing sprees.

301
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,000
He's a mass murderer?

302
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,375
Then he's prob'ly headed
for the shopping district.

303
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,291
[MISUZU]
No.

304
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,208
Considering the circumstances,

305
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,583
I believe the first
thing he'd want to do...

306
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,750
[CHUTA yells]

307
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,708
Oh, wow! It's the local branch!

308
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:33,208
...is eliminate any officers
who may be pursuing him.

309
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,458
Escapee located.

310
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,791
Kinda looks like a
crab, doesn't it?

311
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,000
[CHUTA]
Eww, so gross.

312
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,750
This is elDLIVE.

313
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,625
Come quietly and do not try
to resist. Do you understand?

314
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,666
Don't think he's gonna listen!

315
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,041
Then let's catch him, Chuta.

316
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,166
We can't catch that thing!

317
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,541
Sonokata!

318
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,583
You have the right
to remain silent.

319
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,083
And you have the
right to an attorney.

320
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,041
[MISUZU] Furthermore,
anything you say can and will

321
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,791
be used against you in
intergalactic court of law.

322
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,291
[DRAGLINE]
Screw your court of law!

323
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:25,083
I'm killing as many
Earthlings as I want!

Are you attempting to
resist arrest, sir?

325

[DRAGLINE]
Gah! SPH! No!

326
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,125
He ran?

327
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,666
No, he's still here.
He's just hiding from us.

328
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,166
If I take on a monster like that
unarmed, then I'll be killed!

329
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,541
But I'll be with you!

330
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,333
And we arrested that
Blob-Blob together yesterday,

331
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,791
Yesterday was a fluke!
I can't do this!

332
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,583
So you're just gonna go back
to being a pessimist now?

333
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,708
Yesterday, you courageously
asserted yourself,

334
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,958
and in doing so,
awakened my powers.

335
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,041
I thought you'd finally
regained your confidence

336
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,916
and accepted your past.

337
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:05,583
You can't expect me to just
completely change overnight.

338
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,375
Besides, it's at least
partly your fault

339
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,083
that I am the way I am!

340
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,958
You're also to blame
for me saying weiner

341
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,291
in front of Misuzu!

342
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,750
Could you please stop
saying such vulgar things?

343
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh, that's right. She can't
hear Dolugh's voice.

00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:24,208
Well, you've made
it quite clear.

345
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,125
If you can't handle
this criminal,

346
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,375
then you're not fit
to be in elDLIVE.

347
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,333
It's best for all
of us if you resign.

Hey! An old lady and her
dogs are approaching!

Nice one, Chuta!

00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,000
I did it, without thinking.

00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,708
[DOLUGH]
What do we do now?

355
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,125
Let's sew him up for good!

[DOLUGH]
Sympathy!

357
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,333

He deflected it?

...attacking civilians.

365

Confirming that apprehension
is proving difficult.

I will now take action...
according to regulations.

Uh? But, Sonokata...

[MISUZU]
Of course I did.

He ignored my repeated warnings
