you think you are?

Who are you people?

00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,541
We're with Space Police elDLIVE.

8
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:29,083
And you're under arrest
on suspicion of murder.

Huh, Space Police, you say.

11
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,416
Dammit!

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,583
You ruined everything
I've been working on, kid!

13
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,625
Explain this to me, then:

14
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:45,291
How great of a plan is it when
it hinges on a frail old man?

15
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:46,500
Oh, shut up!

16
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,208
I didn't need him,
I just needed his brain!

17
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,041
It was the key to the
gate, and with it,

18
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,000
I coulda got my hands
on the treasure!

Treasure?

20
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,333
I'm completely lost.

21
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:57,833
Whatever it is, losing it's
made him really angry.

22
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:01,541
And I know I'd be angry, too,
if I lost what I wanted.

23

Oh, my.

24
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,333
Seems both the Space Police

25
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,708
and the criminal underworld
were after you.

26
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:09,208
So you hid yourself
in this tiny room.

27
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:13,208
Then you finally found a way
out, but it was all pointless.

28
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:16,583
I'm sorry you had such
a sad end, Doctor Love.

I've heard enough.

What did you do to him
in that explosion?

73
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,333
[MAN]
I'll explain.

74
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,958
The blast contained a
unique SPH removal beam

75
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,416
to cleanse his body.

76
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,250
Someone else has been
controlling him from afar.

77
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,041
Wait, some kind of
remote control SPH?

78
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,208
[MAN]
Exactly.

79
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,708
As you imply, it's an SPH

80
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,208
that allows the
individual emitting it

81
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,250
to control the actions
and personality

82
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,375
of whomever absorbs it.

83
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,958
You can tell if
someone's absorbed it

84
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,708
by the amber-colored membrane
that will form in their eyes.

85
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,125
Until now, though,

86
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,916
I'd only heard of it existing
in a laboratory setting.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Besides the remote control SPH,

88
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:13,125
this criminal is an otherwise
normal, boring Earthling.

89
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,000
So then, he's no mastermind!

90
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,208
[MAN]
Exactly.

91
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,291
This makes me worry
about Doctor Love.

92
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,000
Someone unusual's
out to get him.

93
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,583
The nerve of you!

94
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,958
Aren't you the one who left his

95
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,583

That's right.

96
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,791
But that's not his real body.

97
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,625
It's just waste
material left over

00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,375
from the reconstruction
procedure.

there was an unexpected anomaly.

101
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,708
Basically, all the new cells
separated from the old ones.

102
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,916
Like shedding a skin.

No, hold on.

Yeah, that's it! You're
descended from Kurzians!

128
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,125
That must mean your kicks
are really powerful.

129

Aw, you're so sweet.

130

That's amazing.

The most distinctive feature
on Kurzian anatomy

is not their forehead horn,

135

That's not what the project is.

164
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,041
Besides, when Misuzu
met with him,

165
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,083
the Doctor was still
an old man, Chuta.

166
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,708
[screams]

167
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,416
Get out of my mind before you
destroy it, Doctor Love!

168
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,708
Why the freak out, rookie?

169
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,500
I'm fine. It's just a
bad day-dream is all.

170
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,125
Well, we secured Doctor
Love in one piece.

171
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,458
It's time to head back.

172
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,833
We didn't leave this
place in one piece, though.

173
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,041
Since I'm not under arrest,

174
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,500
can you take these
off me please?

175
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,791
Oh, right! I guess I don't
mind taking those off!

176
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:47,916
What the--?

177
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
No! Veronica! Chips!

178
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,500
[NINOTCHKA]
I like seeing your body

179
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,666
all young and healthy,
Doctor Love.

180
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,708
But all I really
need is your brain.

181
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,583
And I can open the
pathway to the treasure.

182
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,250
What? Officer Ninotchcka?

183
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,166
[LOVE]
Observe her eyes.

184
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,916
She's been taken over by the
remote control SPH, as well.

185
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,666
[NINOTCHKA] It's hard to
run from me, Doctor.

186
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,250
No. She killed her!

187
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,291
[LOVE]
One thing I don't understand.

188
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,000
Remote Control SPH requires

189
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,541
a melding of both
parties' consciousness.

190
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,625
How did you cleanly take
over an officer of elDLIVE?

191
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:28,041
I'd be happy to show you
my method, Doctor Love.

192
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:41,333
We'll have lots of time because
you're coming with me.

193
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,916
I must decline.

194
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,958
Scientists always
seem to get killed

195
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,500
once they're deemed useless.

196
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,375
I don't believe I was
asking you, Doctor.

197
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,166
Now come with me.

198
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,291
This doesn't bode well for me.

199
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,541
[CHUTA]
Wait!

200
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,583
The Doctor stays right here!

201
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,208
Well, I forgot
all about you, boy.

202
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,833
Looks like you have a death
wish, Chuta Kokonose.

203
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:18,958
What happened, Ninotchka?
You were so sweet.

204
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,083
Doctor Love.

205
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,541
We need your removal beam!

206
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,458
We have to get the
remote control SPH

207
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,041
out of Ninotchka's body!

208
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,708
If somehow you could
wound or disable her,

209
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,083
that would buy me enough
time to repair the removal beam

210
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,708
and ready it to fire.

211
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,708
All right! Then it's all
riding on us. Let's go!

212
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,916
Right.

213
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,208
We're gonna stop her.

214
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,083
What I'm about to say
might sound a bit odd,

215
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,458
but I'm actually really
excited for this.

216
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,041
Monitaliens are one of
my research subjects.

217
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:02,916
[BOTH]
Huh?

218
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,125
[LOVE]
It's my good fortune

219
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,833
that's there's one
growing on you, Chuta.

220
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,500
Uh. Okay.

221
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,000
[NINOTCHKA]
I know you psyched yourself up,

222
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,041
but the smart move
would be to surrender.

223
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:17,083
You've no clue...
how strong I am!

224
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,916
[giggles]

225
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,125
Dolugh! Sew her up!

226
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,708
[DOLUGH]
Sympathy!

227
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,541
[chuckles]

228
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,166
[grunting]

229
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,458
[BOTH scream]

230
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,708
That Monitalien,
he hasn't been updated yet.

231
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,583
They'll need a miracle.

232
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,291
Are you okay? Chuta!

233
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,166
[NINOTCHKA]
Aw, what's wrong?

234
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,166
So much for you and your
parasite stopping me.

235
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,416
[CHUTA] We can't win. She's
in a whole different league.

236
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,000
Chuta! I'm starting
to fade away!

237
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,333
You have to keep
your confidence up!

238
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,583
[CHUTA]
I know, Dolugh, I know!

239
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,125
But it seems hopeless.

240
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,833
How can I fight against
someone who's so strong?

241
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,625
Chuta.

242
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,250
[VERONICA]
Run.

243
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,750
Just run... away.

244
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,791
Inspector Veronica?

245
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,666
You can't win, so run.

246
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,916
It's all my fault, Chuta. Sorry.

247
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,666
Don't say that!

248
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,541
[VERONICA]
Go now!

249
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:23,250
Run, Chuta.
Get outta this alive!

250
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,416
Save myself?

251
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,666
[CHUTA] But if I run away,
I'm leaving Veronica,

252
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:35,416
Doctor Love, Chips, and
Ninotchka here to die.

253
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,375
And what about Sonokata?

254
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,583
No. I'm the only one
who can help them.

255
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,375
It's all on me.

256
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,958
Chuta, you're not
going anywhere!

257
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,916
Just hold on!
Stay with me, Veronica.

258
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,708
Listen, it's all going to
be all right. I promise!

259
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,083
Looks like I'm coming
back into view!

260
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,416
The return of your confidence

261
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,833
has me feeling like a
million bucks, Chuta!

262
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:02,833
What happened?

263
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,708
I don't know. I just--

264
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,708
I realized I have to
believe in myself!

265
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,791
And that... I have
to save everyone!

266
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,625
You love your friends, huh?

267
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,166
And that's why you believe.

268
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,208
I don't think your confidence
has ever been stronger!

269
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,916
Yes. Let's go, Dolugh!

270
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,625
Yoyosa!

271
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,333
My goodness, look
who's back for more.

272
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,708
[DOLUGH] You can't win by
running away, Chuta.

273
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,166
You've gotta get behind her.

274
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,916
Yeah, but how?
She's looking right at us!

275
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,208
[DOLUGH]
Good point.

276
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:39,208
Look at those cables, Chuta!

277
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,833
I've got an idea!

278
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,791
[NINOTCHKA]
You wanna play hide-and-go-seek?

279
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:47,666
Okay then. But you're just
delaying the enevitable.

280
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,583
[NINOTCHKA]
A decoy made from cables?

281
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,291
Now, Dolugh! Blast her!

282
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,166
Aw, that's cute. Now watch this.

283
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:07,833
[chuckles]

284
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,875
Dolugh!

285
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:21,291
Too strong! Dolugh, turn away!

286
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,333
Can you hear me?

287
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,916
Dolugh!

288
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,083
[gasps]

289
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,208
[chuckles]

290
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:53,958
The air's full of burning SPH.
It smells like death.

291
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,291
[LOVE]
Huh?

292
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,333
[CHUTA]
My face... it's so hot.

293
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,208
What's going on?

294
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,750
[CHUTA]
I can't-I can't talk.

295
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,458
What happened to me? Dolugh.

296
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:16,750
[CHUTA]
Dolugh.

297
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,208
[gasps]

298
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,791
[CHUTA]
Dolugh?

299
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:30,541
Damage to a host and
Monitalien applies equally.

300
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:34,291
Given Dolugh's injuries,
Chuta must be in bad shape.

301
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,750
[CHUTA]
I-I can't breath.

302
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,291
[NINOTCHKA]
Monitaliens are nothing more

303
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,208
than useless old relics.

304
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,666
For a Monitalien and
its host to die in agony

305
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,208
is a fitting end
for both of you.

306
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:54,833
[CHUTA] So that's...
what's happening... I'm dying.

307
00:15:54,916 --> 00:16:02,125
Without saving Veronica, Chips,
Ninotchka, or Sonokata.

308
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,541
Dammit!

309
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,083
[DOLUGH]
Chuta.

310
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:11,458
[CHUTA]
Uh? Dolugh, is that you?

311
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,500
[DOLUGH]
Lately, I've been thinking

312
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,083
about why you ignored the
evidence against Misuzu

313
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,333
and still trusted her anyway.

314
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,041
Are you serious?

315
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,875
We're both near death and
you're still bringing that up?

316
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,875
[DOLUGH] Not long ago,
you wouldn't have been able

317
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,208
to trust someone the
way you trust her.

318
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,375
Since joining elDLIVE,
you've changed so much.

319
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,958
And since you put
up walls for so long,

320
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:36,041
I'm interested any time
your personality changes.

321
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,958
I think I know what's behind
this. Would you like to hear it?

322
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,541
Since you like Misuzu,
you believe in her.

323
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,875
And that makes you trust

324
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,208
that she wouldn't do wrong
without good reason.

325
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,791
And because Doctor Isaac
believes in you,

326
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,458
he thought you'd be able
to help clear her name.

327
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,458
That's why he told
you Miszu's secret

328
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,583
about needing the medicine.

329
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,583
And now, you wanna
save more than just her.

330
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,041
I don't think about it.

331
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:04,333
I'm just simply... doing what
my heart tells me to.

332
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,333
And that's... to save everyone!

333
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:11,000
[DOLUGH] Yes, that's it.
You want to save everyone.

334
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,083
But in order to
get to this point,

335
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,541
you had to believe in Misuzu,
and in turn, yourself.

336
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:20,166
Do you understand, Chuta?
It doesn't matter who it is.

337
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,500
Believing in someone is
an expression of hope.

338
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,041
I do believe.

339
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,250
[DOLUGH]
And now, I believe in you, too.

340
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,791
[CHUTA]
Dolugh.

341
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,500
[DOLUGH] My hope is to remain
in a symbiotic relationship

342
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,583
with you and no one else!

343
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,875
[DOLUGH] Killing current
host's life support process.

344
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,500
Activating survival program.

345
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,708
It's evolving.

346
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:47,833
What's this?

347
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,375
When the host of a
Monitalien is dying,

348
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,916
the creature will
attempt to escape

349
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,333
its own pending destruction

350
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,416
by using any remaining
energy to quickly evolve.

351
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,958
It's a fail-safe device.

352
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,708
[NINOTCHKA] After all that,
you're still clinging to life?

353
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:04,291
I'll break your spirit, too!
You half-dead freaks!

354
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,333
[gasps] Deflected?

355
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,791
You underestimate it
at your own peril.

356
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,125
It isn't just trying to survive.

357
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:17,083
It's looking for a new
host that it can attach to.

358
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,791
[DOLUGH]
Next host detected.

359
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:23,791
Calculating necessary evolution
and transformation steps.

360
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,500
[gasps]

361
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:26,958
[DOLUGH]
Attack.

362
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,541
What the--? What was that?

363
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,208
[LOVE]
What a remarkable recovery.

364
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,166
[DOLUGH]
Transformation complete.

365
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,375
Attack!

366
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,625
[LOVE] This Monitalien
evolutionary form

367
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:04,000
is the most advanced of
all lost Griffith technology.

368
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,708
All that's left now is to
toy with its host target

369
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,291
until she gives up.

370
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,708
[DOLUGH]
Attack.

371
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,708
Forget it, pal! No way
I'm giving up this body!

372
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,208
[DOLUGH]
Attack.

373
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,125
[DOLUGH]
Attack.

374
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,916
[CHUTA] I thought you
wanted to stay with me.

375
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,583
[DOLUGH]
New Host disabled. Attack.

376
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:32,041
[CHUTA]
Stop it, Dolugh. Please, stop!

377
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,708
[DOLUGH]
Attack.

378
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,708
[DOLUGH]
Adjusting aim.

379
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,125
Sto--

380
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,625
--[CHUTA] Dolugh. Stop it!
--[DOLUGH] Host secured.

381
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,125
[CHUTA] Come on!
Snap out of this, Dolugh!

382
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:46,958
[DOLUGH]
Attack.

383
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,875
Dolugh!

384
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,458
This isn't who you really are!

385
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:56,625
I... believe in you!

386
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,291
[DOLUGH]
Sympathy!

387
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,000
[groans]

388
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,708
[CHUTA coughing]

389
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:17,875
Are you back now?

390
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:18,958
I'm back!

391
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,166
And you're really you?

392
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,041
I really am me again, Chuta.

393
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:26,125
Dolugh, I'm glad
you're back to normal.

394
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,875
You really had me worried
there for a bit, buddy.

395
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,291
Well done.

396
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,458
You have just managed a
Reconnection with a Monitalien.

397
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,541
What the heck does that mean?

398
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,541
[DOLUGH] I evolved and
left for a new host.

399
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,875
Then I changed my mind
and came back!

400
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,000
And that's how rare?

401
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,000
[LOVE]
It's extraordinarily rare.

402
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,375
Once a Monitalien prepares
to leave its host,

403
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,791
the chance of him
bringing it back

404
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:54,625
with a strong sympathetic
response is a mere 0.02%.

405
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,458
A strong sympathetic
response did that?

406
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,708
What would've happened
if it wasn't strong?

407
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:00,958
You would be dead!

408
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,041
What? Now you tell me?

409
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,333
Even though our chances
for success were low,

410
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,916
we had no choice but to try it

411
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,875
if we wanted to
save our friends.

412
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:12,875
Wait, uh, I think I get it now.
What you said before.

413
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,791
[DOLUGH] Believing in someone
is an expression of hope.

414
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,000
And now, I believe in you, too.

415
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,875
My hope is to remain in
a symbiotic relationship

416
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,166
with you and no one else!

417
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,333
You were talking
about Reconnection.

418
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,583
You know I never gave
up believing in you, Chuta,

419
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,083
and that's why I knew
we would reconnect.

420
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,208
And you kept believing in me!

421
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:37,041
And it all happened because our
shared sympathy was so powerful!

422
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,541
[NINOTCHKA chuckling]

423
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,083
I'm glad you guys're back
to being weak and pathetic.

424
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,916
Makes things easy for me.

425
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,958
[CHUTA]
No.

426
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:49,083
We're much different
now. Stronger.

427
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:52,416
I can feel it.
Isn't that right, Dolugh?

428
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,833
Yes! That's right!

429
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,750
[giggles]

430
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:34,750
[CHUTA] Here's that
rice-cakes-in-soup dish

431
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,083
you've been talking
about, Chief.

432
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,583
It's actually called <i>zoni</i> .

433
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,583
[LAINE] But the one
I liked had darker broth.

434
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,333
And it was sweeter, too!

435
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,000
[DOLUGH]
Next time on <i>elDLIVE</i> :

436
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,416
"Something to Believe
In: Part Three"!

437
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,958
[MISUZU]
That's red bean soup.
