1
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:14,666
[CHUTA]
Michiyo! Matsutaro!

2
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,125
Did you guys bring
something for Gucchi

3
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:17,916
to remember us by when he moves?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,208
[MATSUTARO]
Yup.

5
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:20,916
Cool, it's a ramen spoon!

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,083
And it's from Sankyu!

7
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:23,791
That's super rare!

8
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,875
[MICHIYO]
I brought you a sparkly box!

9
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:28,083
I bought all the supplies
at a hundred-yen shop

10
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,416
and made it myself.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,291
[CHUTA] Whoa, there's
a diamond on there!

12
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh, wow!

13
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,041
What did you bring, Chuta?

14
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:36,791
[CHUTA]
Dolls of all of us.

15
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:37,958
[MICHIYO]
Awesome!

16
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,333
Did you sew those, Chuta?

17
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,416
You're even better than my mom!

18
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,125
[CHUTA] I didn't sew 'em,
I knitted them.

19
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,708
They're called <i>amigurumi</i> .

20
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,416
[MICHIYO]
The pink one must be me.

21
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,375
[GUCCHI]
The redheaded one's me.

22
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,083
[MATSUTARO]
That looks nothing like me.

23
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,791
So do you like 'em, Gucchi?

24
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:53,500
[GUCCHI]
Mh-hm!

25
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,833
Yeah, thanks, you guys!

26
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:59,083
Though, uh, it makes
this hard to say now.

27
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,208
[OTHERS]
Huh?

28
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:02,916
But I don't have to
move away anymore.

29
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:05,625
[MATSUTARO]
Uh.

30
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:06,625
[CHUTA]
Eh?

31
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,125
[MICHIYO]
Huh?!

32
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,625
See, my mom knew how much
I was gonna miss all you guys,

33
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:13,458
so she sat down and had a long
talk with my dad about it,

34
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,791
and they decided we won't
be moving this year.

35
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,583
Why didn't you say
something sooner?

36
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,708
If that's the case,
can I have my spoon back?

37
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:22,708
Uh-huh, and I want the sparkly
box I made for you back too.

38
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,125
[GUCCHI]
Uh!

39
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,666
Hey, that's not fair!

40
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,000
You guys gave me this stuff
'cause you care about me, right?

41
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,791
[CHUTA]
Hey! I got an idea.

42
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:31,208
Why don't we make
a time capsule?

43
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,000
We can put everything
in Michiyo's box

44
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,500
and then open it up
in a few years

45
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:35,833
or even decades from now.

46
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,708
Wow, decades is a long time.

47
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:40,125
Oh, boy, that sounds
really exciting!

48
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,375
[CHUTA]
It'll belong to all of us,

49
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:43,500
so it can still be
yours, too, Gucchi.

50
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,541
Yeah, kind of, I guess, but--

51
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:48,000
[MICHIYO] Wait, Gucchi needs to
put something in there, too!

52
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,041
I do?

53
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,791
You just sprung this
on me suddenly.

54
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,625
Oh, hey, that could work.

55
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,416
My mom wanted me to give
you guys this picture

56
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,375
she took of us.

57
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:01,583
Oh, yeah! That's perfect!

58
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:04,958
Okay, all done.
Now let's go bury it!

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,250
[CHUTA]
It's no use.

60
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,666
[CHUTA sighs]

61
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,250
Looked everywhere, but can't
find that time capsule.

62
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,125
Don't you remember
where it's buried?

63
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,250
[DOLUGH]
Sorry, I was asleep at the time.

64
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,708
[CHUTA groans]

65
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,208
I thought for sure it
was around here.

66
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,208
Something's changed
in you lately, Chuta.

67
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,750
I mean, you've actually started

68
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,666
talking about the friends you
lost when you were younger.

69
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,291
Maybe it's 'cause
I joined elDLIVE,

70
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,375
and so much has happened
in the short time since I did.

71
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,833
Helped me to realize I can't
just keep running forever.

72
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,625
Do not let go!

73
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:18,750
Chuta, help!

74
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,125
Wait right there, guys!

75
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,541
Don't worry, I'll save you!

76
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:23,833
Okay.

77
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,250
[DOLUGH]
The rock on the right!

78
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,583
Right, got it!

79
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,083
[DOLUGH]
No, that one's not safe!

80
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,125
[gasps]

81
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:34,166
[GUCCHI]
Chuta!

82
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,291
[CHUTA]
It's ironic, isn't it?

83
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,000
All that time I spent
running from my past,

84
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,916
but I could never get away.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,125
And now that I'm
trying to embrace it,

86
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,916
it's gone missing.

87
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,125
[DOLUGH]
It's been a while

88
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,500
since you've come to visit
Gucchi's grave, Chuta.

89
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,583
[CHUTA]
Yeah.

90
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,083
I know it's a little early,

91
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,500
but running into Gucchi's mom
and the rest of his family

92
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,583
would be really awkward.

93
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,666
[GUCCHI'S MOM] Why were you
the only one who survived?

94
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,083
Why are you still here
when my Ken is gone?

95
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,083
[CHUTA]
That was the first time

96
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,500
anyone ever glared
at me like that.

97
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,666
But there was
nothing I could say.

98
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,083
I mean, in the end,
it was all my fault.

99
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,458
[DOLUGH] After that,
Mimi held you in her arms

100
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:20,708
and bawled her eyes out.

101
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,083
What? She really did that?

102
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,666
I don't remember that at all.

103
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,958
[DOLUGH] Well, you were in a
state of shock at the time.

104
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,041
[gasps]

105
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,791
Hey, wait a minute. I think I--

106
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:36,000
Aunt Mimi was sobbing, and
hugging me close to her.

107
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,458
[DOLUGH]
And for the next three months,

108
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,041
every night after
you went to bed,

109
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,833
she would cry herself to sleep.

110
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,791
[CHUTA]
Wait, seriously?

111
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:50,250
[CHUTA] Man, I was so
worried about myself,

112
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,750
I didn't even think about

113
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,708
all that Auntie must've been
going through because of me.

114
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,833
[PRINCIPAL A]
And so, students,

115
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:01,333
I implore you to treat one
another in a manner worthy of...

116
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,333
[DOLUGH]
This sure is boring, isn't it?

117
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,125
[PRINCIPAL A] Next, in regards
to your interactions...

118
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,500
[CHUTA]
Oh, crap.

119
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,750
If I fall asleep, Sonokata's
gonna rip into me again.

120
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,041
[gasps]

121
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,208
[SHIZU] Sir, help!
Sonokata just passed out!

122
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,541
Whoa, what happened?

123
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:21,000
Huh? Do you smell
something funn--?

124
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,666
[CHUTA]
Oh, no! Dolugh?

125
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,083
Hey. What's wrong, Chuta?

126
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,208
[CHUTA]
Huh?

127
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,875
Oh, just talking to
myself, as usual.

128
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,583
[buzzing]

129
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:33,208
[CHUTA] Oh, right. I forgot to
put on my headphone patch.

130
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,083
[CHIPS]
This is Inspector Chips, chu.

131
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,583
With Misuzu and Dolugh fainting,
I declare an emergency,

132
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,666
and will be there to
retrieve them, chu.

133
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,750
[CHUTA]
Retrieve them?

134
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,333
[thudding]

135
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:46,833
[STUDENTS gasp]

136
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,083
Skaa.

137
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,833
I'm Sonokata's mother, chu.

138
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,375
Er, I mean, I am
her mother, period!

139
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,000
[STUDENT A]
That's Misuzu's mom?

140
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:07,083
[STUDENT B] But they don't
look anything alike.

141
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,375
[MOM ROBOT] I just happened
to be passing by, chu.

142
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,916
I mean, I just happened
to be passing by.

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,791
Well, clearly that's
Inspector Chips.

144
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,500
The only humanoid robot that was
available on such short notice

145
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,875
was this Melpleian one, chu.

146
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,250
[MOM ROBOT] Misuzu wasn't
feeling well all morning,

147
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,750
so I'll just take her back
to the ship now, chu.

148
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,333
I mean, home.

149
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:33,041
You'd know. Is that odd woman
really her mother, Mr. Yamanaka?

150
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,666
It's strange, but suddenly,

151
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,250
I can't seem to
remember her face.

152
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,875
[MOM ROBOT]
Misuzu, it's me.

153
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,125
Oh. Hi, Mom.

154
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,666
Well, she called her "Mom."
That must mean--

155
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,250
That enormous lady is
really Sonokata's mother?

156
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,375
Uh, ma'am, I'm sorry, but
we really can't allow you

157
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,166
to just take your daughter
out of school like this.

[MOM ROBOT]
Skaa.

00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,833
She is very ill!

[MOM ROBOT]
Oh, and coincidentally,

162
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,500
I just received word from
Chuta Kokonose's aunt,

163
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,541
and for various unrelated and
totally believable reasons,

164
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,708
she wants him to come
home immediately.

165
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,333
[MOM ROBOT]
Quick, come with me, chu.

166
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,625
Yoyos-- I mean... Right!

167
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:25,708
[TOKU gasps]

168
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,041
Oh, does that mean
their families

169
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,583
know about their relationship?

170
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:32,291
That's nice. So nice it
makes me kinda jealous.

171
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,125
[TRANSFER STUDENT A]
Well, we smoked them out.

172
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,916
[TRANSFER STUDENT B]
Looks like it's Misuzu Sonokata.

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,208
And Chuta Kokonose.

174
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:45,333
[ISAAC] Well, I'm not detectin'
any sort of bacterial infection.

175
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:48,791
So the only explanation that
I can think of right now,

176
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,083
off the cuff, is
you came in contact

177
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,958
with a SPH that induces sleep.

178
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,458
[CHUTA]
Um...

179
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:57,875
So how long, approximately,
do I have to stay like this?

180
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,708
I don't like this water
we're in. It's icky.

181
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,666
The elDLIVE personnel
who fainted

182
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,541
may have been contaminated
by this mystery SPH,

183
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:06,791
which is why I'm replacin'

184
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,625
all of the fluids in
your body right now,

185
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,250
as well as in Misuzu's.

186
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,083
[CHUTA gasps]

187
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:15,041
So... Sonokata's naked too?

188
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,583
Where? I can't see her!
Where is she?

189
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,458
[ISAAC] These tanks are
made with two-way mirrors

190
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,083
so you can't see in
from the outside.

191
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,291
[CHUTA]
Ah, okay. Gotcha.

192
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,916
Though the microphones
are on in there

193
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,291
so you can hear each other.

194
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,125
[CHUTA]
Heh?

195
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,500
That's right, you pervert.

196
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:34,125
Please, why can't you just
disappear from my life forever?

197
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,375
Oh, yeah, you can hear what she
says clear as a bell in here.

198
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,250
Regarding the fainting
incident earlier,

199
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,458
we still don't know the
culprit or have a motive yet.

200
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,958
And we've got nothing on
the sleep-inducing SPH

201
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:46,958
we think was used.

202
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,333
Right.

203
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,125
Our SPH radar was unable to
detect anything unusual.

204
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,875
Before he fainted, Dolugh
said he smelled something.

205
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,541
Well, I didn't smell anything.

206
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,291
[ISAAC]
The ability to sense SPH

207
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,958
varies from individual
to individual,

208
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,291
so it's possible you
wouldn't both smell it.

209
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,083
However, I have to say, it is
strange that the SPH radar

210
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,541
didn't pick anything up.

211
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,708
We ran a check for
suspicious people.

212
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:08,958
Or anything that
might've changed

213
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,541
at your school since yesterday.

214
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,541
Found two new transfer students,
a first-year and a third-year.

215
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,958
New transfer students?

216
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,833
[LAINE] Either of 'em
look familiar to you?

217
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:18,916
Not really.

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,083
No, sir.

219
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,500
[LAINE]
I see.

220
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,041
Unfortunately, that's the only
lead we have right now.

221
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,208
So keep an eye on
them tomorrow, okay?

222
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,875
[CHUTA, MISUZU, CHIPS]
Yoyosa!

223
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,916
Might be small consolation now,
but here, have this stimulate,

224
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,166
which should counteract
any sleep-inducing SPH.

225
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,000
Take it just before they
try to knock you out.

226
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,708
One more thing.

227
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,666
We've just received word
that a ship belonging to

228
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,083
the massive criminal
organization known as DeMille

229
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,291
is making its way toward
this solar system.

230
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,083
Wait, DeMille?

231
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,833
Didn't you say they
destroyed a planet?

232
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,416
And now they're headed
towards Earth.

233
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,375
Are you ready, chu?

234
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,875
Yoyosa!

235
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,625
Is there a reason why
we have to conduct

236
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,208
this training exercise now?

237
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:04,000
[CHIPS] It was requested
by Officer Kokonose, chu.

238
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,333
Well, just in case.

239
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,541
If DeMille was involved
in the incident,

240
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,333
I just wanted to be prepared.

241
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,750
This is a waste of time.

242
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,041
Seems like Misuzu's
still mad, Chuta.

243
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,083
You know, 'cause you totally
tried to see her naked before.

244
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,875
Uh, hey, I'm sorry about
earlier. When we were naked.

245
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,166
You know, in the tanks.

Oh, please! Move on!

She says that,

248
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,875
but she still seems
colder than normal.

Using this panel,

you'll select your
desired difficulty level,

then targets will come
flying out of that pot

253
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:35,708
and you'll have to fight them

using various SPH
techniques, chu.

255

They look like flies, Chuta.

If they touch you,
you'll swell up, chu.

Just like when you get stung
by a bee back on Earth.

tell me that before?

you would just automatically
start dodging stuff?

Yes, even if you
didn't say please.

00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:25,291
I'm a natural expert when
it comes to fly swatting.

The Investigations

00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,291
go out in the field
and fight criminals,

323

[CHUTA] Hey, watch it!
Don't scare me like that!

Uh, I thought that
these could help us

spy on those transfer students
from a safe distance.

334
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,500
Only makes you look
more suspicious.

335
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,291
That's why I wrote
"Bird Watching" on there.

I told you, Dolugh.

[CHIPS]
This is Inspector Chips, chu.

--Yes.
--Yeah.

[DOLUGH]
That's too bad, Chuta.

Guess those guys might not've

347

had anything to do
with it after all.

348
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,083
Though doesn't it
seem a bit weird

349
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,833
that they both came down
with a cold on the same day?

That's a coincidence.

All right, son, go ahead
and introduce yourself.

Chuta! Your heart is racing.

00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,208

He looks like... Gucchi.

Nice to meet you.
I'm Mikio Narita.

So it's not him...

00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,500
Duh, of course it's not.

364
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,166
[CHIPS] It looks like
the school had no plans

365
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,791
to welcome a new transfer
student before this morning.

366
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:27,000
Also, there are no files
on a Mikio Narita, chu.

Just to be safe,

you should monitor this

[ENGLISH TEACHER A] "He was
in the reception room then."

371
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,833
In that sentence, "he" is the
subject, "was" is the verb...

372
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,500
So far, there's
nothing suspicious

[DOLUGH] You sure it's okay to
just go up to him like this?

00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,958
Why?

Nothing out of the ordinary
about talking to a classmate,

somewhere along the way

Even if we can't use the

00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:46,250
[CREW MEMBER A] Ha! How do you
like DeMille's newest weapon?

473
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,500
[giggles]

474
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,166
Oh, elDLIVE must be in
sheer panic right now.

475
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,375
The captain can get away with
all sorts of bad things.

476
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,875
[LAINE]
This isn't good.

477
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:58,083
Chuta and the others are
completely isolated.

478
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,375
[CHUTA] When you said
you had to make a stop,

479
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:05,833
guess I wasn't expecting
it to be Sengen Shrine.

480
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,000
So... why we here?

481
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,291
Brings back memories, huh?

482
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,166
We used to play
here all the time.

483
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,250
With Michiyo and Matsutaro.

484
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,541
[gasps]

485
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,125
[gasps]

486
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:24,500
[MISUZU]
Inspector Chips!

487
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,125
Please, wake up!

488
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,125
[TRANSFER STUDENT A]
Your scent is irresistible.

489
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,833
[TRANSFER STUDENT B]
Misuzu Sonokata.

490
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,458
[MISUZU]
The transfer students!

491
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,958
Say nighty-night now.

492
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,583
[MIKIO] We all fell off
a cliff and died,

493
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,375
so why were you
allowed to survive?

494
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,583
Well, Chuta?

495
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,833
[gasps]

496
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,833
You really are him.

497
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,333
Gucchi!

498
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,916
[TATEYAN] Sonokata's mom
looked just like her!

499
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,625
They even have the same eyes.

500
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,250
I guess now we know what
she's gonna look like

501
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,291
when she grows up.

502
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,458
[CHUTA]
Uh, yeah.

503
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:41,833
[DOLUGH]
Next time on <i>elDLIVE</i> :

504
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,916
"A Pursuer From the
Past: Part Two."

505
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,958
[TATEYAN]
Isn't DNA amazing, Chuta?
