[YAMANAKA]
Quiet down, kids!

3
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:13,750
Please extend a nice, warm
Shirobori Middle School welcome

4
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:16,583
to our three new
transfer students!

5
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,000
Uh, Tateyan?

6
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,375
[TATEYAN] Um, Ninotchka,
I know you just got here,

7
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,333
but would you be
Futsal Club manager?

8
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:23,291
What?

9
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,041
Huh? He wants what?

10
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,625
That guy's a creep.

11
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,666
Hey, no flirting
in class, Tateyan.

12
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,416
But you said to welcome her!

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,750
[STUDENTS laughing]

14
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,583
The guy has no shame.

15
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,333
I like that new transfer boy.

16
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:37,208
If he's got a body
to match that face,

17
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,666
then I think we're in business!

18
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,083
I don't like a man with
too many muscles.

19
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,125
[DOLUGH] Girls are really
into Doctor Love.

20
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,291
His good looks are
a total con job.

21
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,416
Underneath that handsome
is a 500-year-old pervert.

22
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,458
I bet I know what he's
thinking right now.

23
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,375
You look as radiant as ever.

24
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,916
Let's begin the
Taklamakan Project.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
As you wish, Doctor Love.

26
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,708
Did you remember to bring
the tanning lotion?

27
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,625
Yes, of course, Doctor Love.

28
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:05,875
Great. Now take off
your clothes.

29
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:08,791
And put this on... for me.

30

[gasps]

31
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:14,500
[MISUZU]
Yes, Doctor Love.

00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:15,500
[CHUTA screams]

33
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:16,666
Why am I the only
one who can see

34
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,208
how dangerous Doctor Love is?

35
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,625
[DOLUGH] Right now, everyone
thinks you're the dangerous one.

36
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:21,666
[CHUTA]
Huh?

37
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,250
[TOKU]
Hey, Misuzu!

38
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,666
If you had to rate the new
transfer boy's calf muscles

39
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,583
on a scale of one to ten,
would you say nines or tens?

40
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:04,958
Wow.

41
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,583
I didn't even know there
was a new transfer student.

42
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,541
It would also be good for
me if he carried around

43
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,958
some extra chocolate
protein shakes.

44
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,125
I'm so hungry; when we
clean the classroom,

45
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,458
will you help me rifle
through his bag

46
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:15,708
to see if he's got any left?

47
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,625
[MISUZU, SHIZU]
No, that would be a crime.

48
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:18,875
[VERONICA]
Well, well, well.

49
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,666
I didn't know Misuzu
goes to this school.

50
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,000
How come you never
said anything, hon?

51
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,000
[sighs]

52
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,625
Oh, wow, so you're
already friends

53
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,208
with one of the
transfer students?

54
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,750
No, she's wrong.

55
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,583
This is the first time I've ever
seen her. I don't know her.

56
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,583
That's not a bad answer.

57
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,083
If we were at work,

58
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,416
I'd use my higher rank to
commend you for quick thinking.

59
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,083
But just because we're now
on even ground at school...

60
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,208
...doesn't mean you'll beat me.

61
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,833
Not in math class and
certainly not in P.E, Misuzu!

62
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,583
[STUDENT A]
Whoa. Catfight.

63
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,958
[STUDENT B]
She's gonna punch her.

64
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,291
[CHUTA]
That's weird.

65
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,250
Why are those two at each
other's throats today?

66
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,666
What's going on?

67
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,291
Oh, wait, what about romance?

68
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:01,541
Will you girls also go
head-to-head over boys?

69
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,500
Who is that, girl?
She bothers me.

70
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,125
That's Toku.

71
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,666
Hey, no fighting!

72
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,083
Come on. Let's go.

73
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,583
I don't wanna leave.
It was just getting good!

74
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,208
[DOLUGH] Ninotchka's more like
a grown up than Veronica.

75
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,250
Yeah, you're right.

76
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,041
[TATEYAN]
Chuta!

77
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,083
Let's go!

78
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,000
[CHUTA]
What? Bowling!

79
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,208
Yeah, I cornered Ninotchka
outside the girls' room

80
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,791
and she said she'd come,

81
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,583
but only if you, Sonokata, and
the other new transfer students

82
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,125
also agreed to go bowl with us.

83
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,166
[CHUTA]
So you asked her out?

84
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,416
[CHUTA]
Wow.

85
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,708
I never knew Tateyan was
so forward with girls.

86
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,500
[DOLUGH]
What a smooth operator!

87
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,208
Don't get so down, Chuta.

88
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,166
It can take a long time to
get comfortable with girls.

89
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,208
[CHUTA] Doctor Love?
Where'd he come from?

90
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,708
I'm 500 years old and
still haven't performed

91
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:45,750
the reproductive act,

92
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,791
so my line's likely
to end with me.

93
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,875
But the Earth female seems drawn
to confident mates like him,

94
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,666
so he'll likely produce
many descendants.

95
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,375
Hey, Chuta, so why didn't you
tell me you knew the new guy?

96
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,875
Uh, I don't know. I just
met him for the first time.

97
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,333
Well, you seem weird
and fun, just like Chuta.

98
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,750
I'm Tateyan!

99
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,875
Hello, and my name's
Takurama-something.

100
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:10,041
I forget. Look, my real name
is Taklamakan Strangelove.

101
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,333
How could you forget
your own alias?

102
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,750
[TATEYAN]
That's a long name, bro.

103
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,500
I think I'll call you Takkun.

104
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,666
Takkun, huh.

105
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,291
[TATEYAN]
Takkun, you wanna bowl with us?

106
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,708
[LOVE]
Sure.

107
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,416
[TATEYAN]
So, Chuta.

108
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,375
I still need you to do
a huge favor for me

109
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,458
and ask Sonokata or else
Ninotchka won't come!

110
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,583
Please!

111
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,375
You see, I've never
talked to her,

112
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,791
but you guys seem tight,
like a married couple.

113
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,708
Uh, we're co-workers.

114
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,583
Ask her yourself!

115
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,375
[MISUZU]
I think I'll pass.

116
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,708
[CHUTA]
I'm a pushover.

117
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,291
That a hard no, or will
you at least consider it?

118
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,125
Veronica, Ninotchka,
and Doctor Love

119
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,625
have said they're all coming.

120
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,250
C'mon, it'll be fun.

121
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,916
I just don't see
any point in going.

122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,666
[CHUTA]
Please, Sonokata?

123
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,125
I said no thank you.

124
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,541
[CHUTA]
Fine.

125
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,375
And besides, why couldn't you
ask me this in person?

126
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,208
The Chief frowns on
using your police badge

127
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:00,958
for personal business.

128
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,916
I don't have a choice!

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,208
You said that you
don't like me near

130
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,291
because of the smell of my SPH.

131
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,458
[gasps]

132
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,125
[MISUZU]
No.

133
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,208
Like I said before,

134
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,583
that was a simple
misunderstanding.

135
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:12,625
I don't believe you.

136
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,250
Especially after you
made a big show

137
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,125
about putting up with it
just for our mission.

138
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,500
That was, like...
I was just...

139
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,791
Why are you still wearing
that stupid nose plug?

140
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:24,041
Well, I wear it because
I-I looked in the mirror...

141
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,791
...and thought I was
missing something.

142
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,333
Are you saying that nose
plug's a fashion accessory?

143
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,083
Uh... yeah.

144
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,625
Well! Then it looks bad!

145
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,541
What do you know
about looking good?

146
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,083
You're just a stinky
middle school boy!

147
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,333
How many times have I said

148
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,875
don't use these badges
for personal business?

149
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,041
[CHUTA]
Chief Laine?

150
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:44,666
That is an elDLIVE badge,
not a cellphone.

151
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,000
C'mon, show some respect.

152
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:50,541
Now, since I heard everything,
and I'm your superior officer,

153
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,958
Misuzu, I order
you to go bowling

154
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,125
You gotta learn to communicate
with the other team.

155
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,166
They might save
your life someday.

156
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,625
Plus, bowling is fun.

157
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,666
Chief, I don't wanna go.

158
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,541
Oh, one more thing.

159
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,916
We've detected very
weak traces of SPH

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,625
at the bowling alley
you'll be visiting.

161
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,125
The data's so faint it
could just be signal noise,

162
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,625
but check it out while
you're there, just in case.

163
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,333
[MISUZU]
Fine. If it's work, I'll go.

164
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,000
All right. Happy rolling!

165
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,541
I'm glad it all worked out.

166
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,041
Guess so. This will be fun.

167
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,250
Don't worry, Chief. I'm sure
that little signal is nothing.

168
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,625
You can never be too sure.

169
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,750
[VERONICA] All right,
this is gonna be awesome!

170
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,833
I'm glad we could
all make it here.

171
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,750
Hey, beats doing homework!

172
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,166
It's been a hundred years
since I last went bowling.

173
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,416
Wait, are you serious?

174
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,083
Sonokata, you've gone
bowling before, right?

175
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,291
Yes. But I'm just here to
investigate that signal.

176
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,666
[CHUTA grunts]

177
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,083
[RADIO GUEST]
So I get to the airport,

178
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,125
and the place is just
swarming with cops!

179
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,458
I almost have a heart attack!

180
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,500
Turns out, mob bosses
from all over the world

181
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,916
were coming to Japan!

182
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,416
[DJ] Whoa, whoa whoa hold
on. Those rumors are true?

183
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,541
[RADIO GUEST]
Guess so!

184
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,208
Just wish I knew why
Italians mobsters

185
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,875
were meeting here
when I need to fly!

186
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,875
All right, no SPH
detected here.

187
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,291
Yeah, I didn't see
anything either.

188
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,500
[LOVE] Same. The place
is criminal-free.

189
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,416
[NINOTCHKA] It feels so nice to
all work together to solve this.

190
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,208
[CHIPS] Just like Chief said,
it's only signal noise, chu!

191
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,416
Hey! What were guys doing?
Let's roll some balls!

192
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,708
[DOLUGH]
He's right, Chuta.

193
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,333
The investigation is done.
Now we can have fun!

194
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,708
Okay, but don't get too excited.

195
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,666
Chief doesn't like
us messing around.

196
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,916
[TONTO]
Yay, Chief! Another strike!

197
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
[yelps]

198
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,458
[TONTO]
You rock at casual Earth sports!

199
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:36,958
[CHUTA]
He's here?

200
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:37,916
[laughs]

201
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,458
[CHUTA]
Wha--?

202
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,750
[laughs]

203
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,875
[CHUTA]
Huh?!

204
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,625
What the heck are Chief and the
ship's crew doing down here?

205
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,625
Doctor Love, are you certain
there's no one bad

206
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:47,833
in this alley?

207
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,250
I'm fairly certain
there's not one bowler

208
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,458
or snack bar patron
worth investigating.

209
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,000
Yeah, we know they're okay,

210
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,541
but Tonto and Riggs sure stand
out from everyone else here.

211
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,833
[DOLUGH]
They are clearly aliens.

212
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,583
What cosplay is that?

213
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,458
Wow, they look so real.

214
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,208
It's not a problem, Chuta.

215
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,083
See, people might think
they're a little weird,

216
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,333
but they'll never think
they're actual aliens.

217
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,333
[LAINE]
Hey, what took ya so long?

218
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,625
I didn't know you were
gonna be here, too.

219
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,041
We didn't know we
were going, either,

220
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,833
until this whole
thing came up today.

221
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,250
But as the bureau's resident
bowling enthusiasts,

222
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,416
we couldn't stay up in orbit

223
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,125
while you kids get
to have all the fun.

224
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,708
Yeah, but what about
the investigation?

225
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,500
Oh, so you know
these guys, too?

226
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,833
Uh, yeah, they're
friends-of-friends-of-friends.

227
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,625
They're also the president
and line workers

228
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,333
at the bento box factory
where my mom works part-time.

229
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,500
That's right. Ignore me
and go with what she said.

230
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,083
I just met these
normal people, too.

231
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,625
[TATEYAN]
Uh.

232
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,750
Boy, that is amazing cosplay!

233
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,208
Thanks, we get
that all the time.

234
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,458
Don't worry about us, guys,

235
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,791
you won't even know
that we're here.

236
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,541
Now go have fun!

237
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,500
[CHUTA]
Huh?

238
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,791
You're bowling in
the next lane,

239
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,166
how in the world
could we miss you?

240
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,958
[TATEYAN]
Yeah!

241
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,125
[CHUTA groans]

242
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,250
Strike!

243
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,333
Oh, so close!

244
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,083
Pick up the spare, Nino!

245
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,333
[LITTLE GIRL A]
Look what I got!

246
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,708
[LITTLE BOY A]
Cool balloon!

247
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,041
No matter how hard
I hit, it won't pop!

248
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,541
How cruel.

249
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,083
Well, he can't fight back
or else he'll blow his cover.

250
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,791
That balloon is mine.
Please give it back.

251
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:37,958
Sure!

252
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,875
Chips, are you okay?

253
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,791
All I want is to bowl,
like a normal humanoid, chu.

254
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:50,125
C'mon, Riggs, that's an
easy spare to pick-up!

255
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay. So far,
Tateyan's in the lead.

256
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,791
[DOLUGH] The elDLIVE people
aren't scoring as high

257
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,833
as I thought they
would, Chuta.

258
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,291
Yeah, you're right.

259
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,791
Since I'm on top,

260
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,958
I'll celebrate by hitting the
head for a minute or ten!

261
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,000
Have fun expelling
your bodily waste.

262
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,166
[TATEYAN laughing]

263
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,208
That's a very
straight-forward young man.

264
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,666
He's a good guy.

265
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,791
He's exactly what I feared
middle school boys are like

266
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,041
and it's gross.

267
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,291
Why did you ever agree
to go bowling with him?

268
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,375
You had said we needed to

269
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,208
get used to life on
Earth, Veronica,

270
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,666
and this seemed like
a good opportunity

271
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,916
for us to get acclimated.

272
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,791
True.

273
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,166
The competition is all right,

274
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,333
but I hate that we're
bowling with a handicap.

275
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,458
Handicap?

276
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,750
To keep it interesting,

277
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,541
we have a rule that
the only way you can score

278
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,250
is to make a split
on your first throw.

279
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,416
[CHUTA] You intentionally leave
a gap between the pins?

280
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,000
Why would you want to do that?

281
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:45,000
Yup! And you're not
allowed to use SPH to do it.

282
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,541
The game's actually more
challenging this way.

283
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,416
[CHUTA]
Why are they all so weird?

284
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,291
I'm playing with normal rules.

285
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,583
Except I throw the ball
with just one finger.

286
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,166
Well, of course you are!

287
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,041
Why not?

288
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,250
When I roll, I close my good eye

289
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,958
and use just the pinky
on my left hand!

290
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,750
Where'd you guys learn to play?

291
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,000
With the handicap in effect,

292
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:05,500
my old nemesis Misuzu
and I are neck and neck.

293
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,458
But that...

294
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,791
...ends right now.

295
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,875
I'll beat you so big
it won't be close.

296
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,041
[DOLUGH] Veronica's really
egging her on, huh.

297
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,000
Um, why are you two always
at each other's throats?

298
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,666
I'm no mad. I just want to point
out that she's hopeless.

299
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,958
[CHUTA]
Oh.

300
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,833
You see, I'm a descendant
of the Kushutonians,

301
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,458
who once used their
military skill

302
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:27,041
to bring peace to the Polar
Galaxy for over 30 centuries.

303
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,791
Kushutonian DNA's also referred
to as "Victory Genes."

304
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,958
Frankly, winning
is in our blood.

305
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,250
So I am not going
to lose to Misuzu!

306
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,125
You think bowling
skill is genetic?

307
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,208
It's a vast universe, with
many dumb ways of thinking.

308
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,666
[VERONICA] Best of all, both of
my parents are Kushutonian,

309
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,375
so at the molecular
level, I'm, like,

310
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,458
pretty much one big
victory gene!

311
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:49,875
I am a true blue... pureblood!

312
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,583
Score that, bitches.

313
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,500
That's a rather
flimsy justification

314

[LEBOWNIANS]
Chips. Chips. Chips...

476
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,833
I just can't get enough
of this matcha, chu.

477
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:51,875
All right! Let's get
this party started!

478
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,750
[LAINE]
Well, that was interesting.

479
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,791
The bowling alley was
actually just a front

480
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,833
the Lebownians were using to
smuggle out Earth insects.

481
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:02,666
They hid their operation behind
special SPH-blocking walls.

482
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,750
We never would've found them

483
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,583
had Sonokata not
busted a hole in one.

484
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,125
So well done, gang.

485
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,083
[ALL]
Yoyosa!

486
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,750
And right after coming
back to work. Nice job.

487
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,166
Yeah, yeah.

488
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,375
Thanks, but breaking that
wall was just an accident.

489
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,666
That you were unconscious
was also strange.

490
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,125
How are you?

491
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,541
You were having such a hard
time breathing back there.

492
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,583
[CHUTA] Oh, no!
My smell's getting worse!

493
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,416
[MISUZU]
I'm anemic.

494
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,708
That's all guys.

495
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,166
If I take some iron
supplements, I'll be fine.

496
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,666
[CHUTA]
You're still lying!

497
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,583
Do you really not want them
to know that you can't work

498
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,500
because of my SPH smell?

499
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,000
Huh...

500
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:39,208
[LOVE] Well, that settles that.
I'm giving you a physical.

501
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,458
[CHUTA, MISUZU]
Uh?

502
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,208
As a doctor, your health
is my highest priority.

503
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,166
Ha! Have fun, Misuzu.

504
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,708
No, really, I'm fine.

505
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,333
Plus, my primary
physician is Doc Isaac.

506
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,250
Let me be more clear.

507
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,750
As a doctor, it is essential

508
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,125
that I thoroughly examine
your naked body.

509
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,750
[CHUTA]
My nightmare's come to life!

510
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,291
Stay back!

511
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,916
Whoa, be careful there!

512
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,666
No way, Chief!

513
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,083
I love that SPH glow.

514
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,750
I want to find the SPH veins

515
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,583
under your armpits
and stroke them.

516
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,500
[MISUZU]
I'll blast you, I swear!

517
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,708
Her armpits?

518
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,666
He sure has a way of
making non-erotic things

519
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,000
sound very creepy.

520
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,458
That's right. Teach 'em
not to mess with us girls!

521
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,166
All I wanna do is reach up
your sleeve and stroke you.

522
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,958
Back! I mean it!

523
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,250
No holes in the spaceship!

524
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,583
No blasting, chu!

525
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,333
[chuckling]

526
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,666
Doctor Love's more
agile than I expected.

527
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,541
Don't admire him,
do somethi-- Ah!

528
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:38,583
[CHUTA] Oh, man. I can't
believe I made Sonokata faint.

529
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,041
As if I wasn't already
self-conscious enough

530
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,458
about my body odor!

531
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,541
[CHUTA] Remember Sonokata
blasting off Tateyan's hair?

532
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,291
Well, the good news
is Doctor Love

533
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,125
used his latest hair
growth technology

534
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:24,958
to get it back to the orange
mop we all know and love.

535
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:28,958
But now, sometimes, he acts
like a different person.

536
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,375
[TATEYAN]
Next time on <i>elDLIVE</i> ...

537
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,708
[MISUZU] I could swear there
were still three left.

538
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,000
Oh, well, thanks, Nino.

539
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,333
[NINOTCHKA]
No problem!

540
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,125
Apparently, Inspector Chips
likes yours so much,

541
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,625
it's all he's drinking now.

542
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,291
[MISUZU]
What?

543
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,208
[DOLUGH] Next time on <i>elDLIVE</i> :
"Capture That Face!"

544
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,541
[CHIPS]
Ooh! Delicious, chu!
