1
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,166
Who the hell are you?

2
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:37,125
[PROFESSOR] More often than not,
I am called the Professor.

3
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,958
Now, if you're finished,
I'd like to begin.

4
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,250
[BOTH gasp]

5
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,791
[RINKA]
Wait. Where are we?

6
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,875
You're inside your own heads.

7
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,416
Well, to be more accurate,

8
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,166
I'm inside your heads.

9
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,958
My power is to project
imagery into another's mind.

10
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,708
[RINKA, MURASAKI gasp]

11
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:38,250
[PROFESSOR] Despite the
undeniable veracity in sight,

12
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,375
sound, touch, and taste.

13
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:44,625
What you're experiencing is
nothing more than an illusion.

14
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,750
[gasps] You have that rock?

15
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:48,791
Just as you.

16
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,500
I was not born with this power.

17
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,375
[PROFESSOR] I obtained it
by coming into contact

18
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,166
with these fish.

19
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,541
[PEGGY squeals]
[RINKA gasps]

20
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,416
Oh, my.

21
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,375
[RINKA, MURASAKI gasp]

22
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,041
[PROFESSOR]
How silly of me.

23
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:06,666
It slipped my mind you were
accompanied by the collector.

24
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,000
[RINKA] Are we supposed
to know who that is?

25
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,083
Do you mean Peggy?

26
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,375
[PEGGY squeaks]

27
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,416
[PROFESSOR]
This rock?

28
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,333
It's a fragment from a certain
legendary stone tablet.

29
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:23,416
[PROFESSOR] It has the power
to excavate innate abilities

30
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,291
buried deep within
all living creatures.

31
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,083
And these flying fish?

32
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:32,250
Our human eyes only interpret
this cosmic power as such.

33
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,541
[MURASAKI, RINKA yelp]

34
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,125
[PROFESSOR]
Of all my research.

35
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:44,541
This artifact is by far my
most significant discovery.

36
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,875
[gasps]

37
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:48,666
Wait, Rinka!

38
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,875
I just had a flash
of who this guy is.

39
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,083
[RINKA]
What?

40
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,375
[MURASAKI] He's the one
who's been spreading

41
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:56,083
the fish throughout Tokyo!
I saw him doing it!

42
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,708
[RINKA] Really? Do you
know where you saw him?

43
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,791
[PROFESSOR]
She didn't actually see me.

44
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,125
She just read the
memories of the fish.

45
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,958
But still, I can't
deny her claim.

46
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,125
I've been periodically
spreading them about

47
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,458
for the past three months.

48
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,458
[PROFESSOR] I had a sneaking
suspicion the collector

49
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:17,500
would eventually appear to
gather the fish I had released.

50
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,291
[PEGGY]
Wah!

51
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,583
My assumption is
the collector exists

52
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,708
as a natural safeguard.

53
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,208
I am surprised.

54
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,875
I had no idea what creature
it would inhabit.

55
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:31,958
[PEGGY squeaks]

56
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,875
[PROFESSOR]
An interesting choice.

57
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,041
[PEGGY]
Woo!

58
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,333
Why do you keep releasing
all of the fish?

59
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,791
[PROFESSOR] I'd rather
ask you a question instead.

60
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,750
Why do you feel the need
to continue fighting?

61
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,666
For some ambiguous
sense of justice?

62
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,250
Or could it be that you simply
have feelings for Kyotaro?

63
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:55,291
[RINKA gasps] Um, Kyotaro's
nothing more than my friend.

64
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,416
No matter what your reasons are,

65
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,833
I honestly cannot help
but to admire your actions.

66
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,416
[rumbling]

67
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,166
[PROFESSOR] So then,
why not join me in my venture

68
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,125
to create a new world order?

69
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,583
A new world order?
What are you talking about?

70
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,250
Within one week's time,

71
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,250
Tokyo will witness
a genuine miracle.

72
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,041
And all will become clear.

73
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:23,708
Take this time to
carefully consider my offer.

74
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,916
[PROFESSOR] The two of you
are among the chosen,

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,916
and I think it's time you
realize what that means.

76
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:41,458
A dream?

77
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,000
[gasps]

78
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,625
Oh, sorry!

79
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,833
Did something happen out here?

80
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,875
[KYOTARO]
Wait, are you sure?

81
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,333
That's what he
was calling himself?

82
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,500
I'm sure. He was strange.

83
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,958
We definitely need
to watch out for him.

84
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,458
All I saw was you guys
standing in the parking lot.

85
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,875
Do ya think he was
making ya have

86
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,083
some kinda crazy hallucinations?

87
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,125
That makes the most sense.

88
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,416
You're not gonna believe this,

89
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,291
but I'm pretty sure
I know who he is.

90
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,583
Hokusai Azuma.

91
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,958
He's the man who adopted me.

92
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,250
[door clicks]

93
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,125
[PROFESSOR] I dropped in on
Kyotaro and his new friends.

94
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,666
[MINAMI] And? Did you
bring him back with you?

95
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,875
Oh. Don't be impatient.

96
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:35,083
I only had time for a brief chat
with the so-called "White Girl".

97
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
[PROFESSOR]
I have to admit,

98
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,416
she is a rather
intriguing character.

99
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,000
[MINAMI]
Tch!

100
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,166
Here you are, Young Kyotaro.

101
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,375
Your parents were both
very dear friends of mine.

102
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:15,333
I've come to bring you
to Japan with me.

103
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,791
[gasps]

104
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,000
[PROFESSOR]
Once you get settled in,

105
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,541
we'll have you
enrolled in the same

106
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,083
middle school as Minami.

107
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,833
If you need any help
getting adjusted,

108
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,916
you can always speak with her.

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,541
Um. Nice to meet you.

[SEGAWA]
Hey. C'mere, foreigner.

111
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,916
Are you really livin'
in the same house

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,583
with Minami Azuma?

113
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,583
[SEGAWA GOON 5A]
Well. Have you banged her yet?

114
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,375
I bet she moans like
a cat in heat. Am I right?

115
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,166
So listen, why don't
you bring her

116
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,625
by the storage room in the gym?

Uh...?

We're just askin' ya
to share the wealth

and give us a taste.

[YOUNG KYOTARO groans]

126
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,166
This whole city--

127
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,166
It's filled with guys like that.

128
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,541
I know it looks peaceful
on the surface,

129
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,666
but it's completely
infected beneath.

130
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,583
Still. It's exactly
where we need to be.

131
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,708
A city this foul.

132
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,166
It should be purged
from the Earth.

133
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,166
[YOUNG KYOTARO]
This is nice.

134
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,333
Huh?

135
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,875
This is the first time that

136
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,291
I've heard you speak
a full sentence.

137
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,958
[RINKA] Ugh. Finals are
right around the corner.

138
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,500
But everything keeps getting
in the way of studying.

139
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,083
So, are you worried about

140
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,916
what the Professor
told you? The miracle?

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,958
[RINKA]
Mm-hm.

142
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,625
Within one week's time,

143
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:26,000
Tokyo will witness
a genuine miracle.

144
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,541
I keep thinking about it.

145
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,500
Dad told me to just
forget what he said,

146
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,333
and ignore whatever
ends up happening.

147
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,000
But I don't really know
how I can do that.

148
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:36,875
I'm sorry!

149
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,208
Why?

150
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,958
It's gotta be
way harder for you.

151
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,333
Considering that
they're your family.

152
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,666
No, it's not like that.

153
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,000
To be entirely honest,

154
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,500
I'm really just
worried about you.

155
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:48,916
[RINKA gasps]

156
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,000
And I'm actually not
all that surprised.

157
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,458
I had a weird feeling something
like this might happen to me.

158
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,500
Huh?

159
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,208
Because my real parents...

160
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,416
They were both on the same
research team as the Professor.

161
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,375
I traveled with them
when I was a kid.

00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,541
They took me overseas
to an archaeological site

163
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,916
they were excavating.

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,041
They basically raised me
on fantastic stories

165
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:13,375
of alleged miracles throughout
history, and the mysteries

166
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,000
behind whichever
culture and mythology

167
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,625
they were studying at the time.

168
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,166
So this makes sense.

169
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,041
These ESP powers somehow
fit right into that stuff.

170
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,375
And when they
awakened within me,

171
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,416
I couldn't help but feel
there was some kind of

172
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,375
connection between them and
all of my parents' research.

173
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,166
For all I know,
the death of my parents,

174
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,625
even that civil war--
Professor's research

175
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,458
could've been behind it all.

176
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,750
No matter what,

177
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,666
if Minami's being
controlled by the Professor

178
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,458
against her will,
I have to help her.

179
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,083

the need to continue fighting?

sense of justice,

187
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,750
or could it be

188
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:24,041
that you simply have
feelings for Kyotaro?

come in handy somehow.
