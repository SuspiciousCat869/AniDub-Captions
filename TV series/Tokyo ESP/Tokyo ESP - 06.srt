00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,250
Now peel off
those sweaty shorts.

160
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,375
[KUROI]
That is not gonna happen, Rinka!

161
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,958
You can wash my hair,
if you wanna help!

162
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,208
[RINKA]
So, is it too hot?

163
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,625
[KUROI] Nah, it's fine. Y'know,
this sucks pretty damn hard.

164
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,916
First I get shot by
my own little sister,

165
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,458
then my rival drags my
unconscious ass to safety.

166
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:40,833
Kyotaro saved you.
Saved both of us.

167
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,333
You're an idiot if you
think he's dead, Rinka.

168
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,833
I promise you,
he's alive and kicking.

169
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,166
If she had wanted to kill him,

170
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,291
she could've sealed
the deal right there.

171
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,583
Why take him along, y'know?

172
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,125
[yells]

173
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,583
Been a while since
we sparred huh?

174
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,958
Couple o' years
at the very least!

175
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,708
[yells]

176
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,208
Somebody's out for blood.

177
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,708
You ain't holdin' back. Good!

178
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,791
[RINKA, RINDOU grunting]

179
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,958
You've completely poisoned
his mind, you know.

180
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,000
[yells]

181
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,791
[RINKA]
It's my fault. I let it happen.

182
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,791
The Professor told me
he was gonna do something

183
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:30,083
and I just stuck
my head in the sand.

184
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,875
I couldn't even save Kyotaro.

185
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,083
[RINKA] When's it gonna sink in
I'm not some superhero?

186
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,750
I'm just a kid who's
in way over her head.

187
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,083
It's okay, doll.

188
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,125
This ain't even
your fight and still,

189
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,208
you're doin' everything ya can.

190
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,958
[RINKA]
You don't get it, Dad!

191
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,708
They could do it
all again tomorrow.

192
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:57,666
[RINKA] And I'd still be
just as powerless to stop them.

193
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,875
[YODANI] If you honestly
believe that, then why even

194
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:03,000
bother worrying your pretty
little head about it, huh?

195
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:06,375
[YODANI laughs]

196
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,708

[gasps]

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,833
[RINKA yelps]

200
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:21,000
[YODANI laughs]
Not much of a fighter,

201
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,583
but you do have other assets!

202
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,083
[RINKA yelps]

203
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,166
Gimme back my bra!

204
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,250
[RINDOU]
Whoa, down, girl!

205
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,250
That panda's a pal o' mine.

206
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,125
[YODANI] Well, it's been
quite a while now.

207
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,875
Hasn't it, Urushiba?

208
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,041
[RINDOU]
It has, Roshi.

209
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,291
Huh?

210
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,291
You mean you actually
know this pervert furry?

211
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,666
That's putting it lightly.

212
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,208
The man inside
this suit taught me

213
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,208
everything I know
about martial arts.

214
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,458
He's my sensei.

215
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,041
[RINKA]
What?!

216
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,333
[RINDOU]
Whoa! You're an esper, too?

217
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,791
It's like an epidemic.

218
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,291
[YODANI] Turns out an old
panda can learn new tricks.

219
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,625
Mine is to view events
from a remote distance.

220
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,666
So, uh, what's with the mascot?

221
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,166
No idea.

222
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,166
[YODANI] Every now and then,
I get a glimpse of you all,

223
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,208
and that "Professor" fella.

224
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,000
[RINKA]
Then you can find Kyotaro!

225
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,125
[YODANI]
Don't get to pick what I see.

226
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,416
But ya don't exactly
need precognition

227
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,416
to know what's comin'.

228
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,458
[YODANI] People are sad
and scared these days.

229
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,875
Can't blame 'em.

230
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,833
There's a hell of
a darkness prowling

231
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:36,791
the edges of the city
right now, waiting to strike.

232
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,916
Sticking your head in
the sand like an ostrich

233
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,208
won't help any.

234
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:44,625
The boogeyman's lurking
out there all the same.

235
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,208
We've got villains.

236
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,541
So let's make sure,
we have enough heroes

237
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:53,791
to give the Professor
and his the what-for.

238
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,500
Of course, it's up
to each of you

239
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,375
whether you lend a hand or not.

240
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,750
I know you've
scuffled with 'em a bit,

241
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:05,125
but the real fight is coming,
and it's gonna be a doozy.

242
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,583
So, then.

243
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,958
Do you have the backbone
to train with me

244
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,916
and tread the hero's path?

[PROFESSOR]
The injury you sustained

251
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,583
while battling the White Girl?

252
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,875
Of course it doesn't.

253
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,666
In the big picture,
this wound is nothing.

254
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,416
We allowed so many
people to die, Father.

[PROFESSOR]
Minami.

256
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:03,541
Have you begun to regret
this life we've chosen?

257
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:07,583
[MINAMI] Of course not.
You'll never be alone.

258
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,375
I promise you that.

259
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,916

[MINAMI]
Don't bother.

265
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,791
Father's used his power
to clip your wings.

266

[PROFESSOR]
My fellow espers!

267
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:22,291
Your powers are not
a burden, but a gift to you!

268
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,916
Now is the time to rise up
and use those gifts!

269
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,791
Yours is a tremendous power
they cannot hope to rival!

270
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,583
This little viral plague
has been their call to arms.

The number of esper-related

chasing their tails.
They can't decide.

just as happy to chuck

00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:28,541
All you need to worry about
is staying inside that circle!

316
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,875
[RINKA] But, look how
small the circle is!

317
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,583
How do you expect
me to have any room

318
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:33,791
to maneuver in here?

319
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,083
[YODANI] Wouldn't be
a problem if you weren't

320
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,625
so in love with kicking.

321
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,958
Huh?

322
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,500
[YODANI] The combat training
you're gonna receive

323
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,250
is the same I taught your father
and the other police cadets

324
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,375
at the academy back
in the good ol' days

325
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,958
before my retirement.

326
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:50,416
It's a counter-riot
technique I've named C.P.C!

327
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,000
Close. Panda. Combat!

328
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:56,125
[grunting]

329
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,041
[YODANI] Punching and kicking
may seem effective,

330
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,291
but all they do is
anger your target.

331
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,375
It's better to counter
the enemy's moves

332
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,541
and throw off their
center of gravity.

333
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,416
Grapple them into your hold
and then push, pull, and twist

334
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,333
to take 'em down with
the least amount of fuss.

335
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,791
And once you've
got your opponent

336
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:15,750
firmly on the ground,
that's all she wrote.

337
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,958
Man. That's boring!

338
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,791
[YODANI]
You sure are mouthy, eh?

339
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,125
[RINDOU]
Master Roshi.

340
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,708
I'm gonna be late for work
if I don't get going,

341
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,125
but I'll be back in a bit.

342
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,708
[YODANI]
I see.

343
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:29,875
Not that you've earned it, but
I guess you can take a break.

344
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:33,666
Dang. I am so wiped out!

345
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,708
Hey, mind if I
steal ya for a sec?

346
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,250
[RINKA]
So, how's the shoulder?

347
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:49,083
[KUROI] Better, but it's sure
taking its sweet-ass time.

348
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,500
Startin' to get
restless, y'know?

349
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,416
[RINKA]
I bet.

350
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,333
[KUROI] Look, Rinka, you've got
a really shitty attitude.

351
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,083
[RINKA]
Huh?

352
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,458
[KUROI]
Seriously.

353
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,500
Just watching you practice
even pisses me off.

354
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,083
I've seen a lot of
people come around

355
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,708
who think the same way you do.

356
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,583
The ones who always think
it's best to avoid a fight

357
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,750
and then by the time they
embrace it as an option,

358
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,083
it's practically too late.

359
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,958
Most people are like that.

360
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,500
[KUROI] That kinda
thinkin's gonna get you

361
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,125
straight up killed next time.

362
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,916
[KUROI] Do this for real,
or walk away.

363
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,625
I hope you know losing you would
break your old man's heart.

364
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,875
[RINKA]
Yeah, I know that.

365
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:41,875
[YOUNG KUROI whimpering]

366
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,000
[KUROI]
I've lived like a stray dog

367
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,958
ever since I was
just a little kid.

368
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,708
Watching you and your dad,

369
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,791
it makes me feel kinda
peaceful or some shit.

370
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,833
Having a family seems
like a sweet deal.

371
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,708
[KUROI]
Oh, hey!

372
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,291
When this is all said and done,
we still gotta fight again!

373
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,666
[RINKA]
Huh?

374
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,750
[KUROI]
You heard me!

375
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,458
I'd practice my ass off
if I were you.

376
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,791
Just you and me, girl!
No holds barred!

377
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,833
[RINDOU]
Hey, Rinka.

378
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,416
[RINKA]
What's up?

379
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,583
Detective Nabeshima
dropped by work today

380
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,833
and gave this to me.

381
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,333
Asked me to pass it onto you.

382
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,333
[RINDOU] I guess they must've
found it when they were

383
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:37,166
clearing out the rubble
around Tokyo Tower.

384
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:47,125
[RINKA] This is it.
I have to get stronger!

385
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,458
I couldn't stop
the Professor last time.

386
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,041
But next time will be different!

387
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,958
Either I stop him,
or I die trying.

388
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,375
[RINKA]
Master Roshi!

389
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:13,708
I know that I wasn't
ready before,

390
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:17,250
but I am now if you're
still willing to teach me.

391
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,666
[YODANI] Sounds to me like
you've found your resolve.

392
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,375
So from here on out,
I won't take any more excuses!

393
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,583
Right!

394
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,166
[YODANI]
This here is Ayumu Ozora.

395
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,250
He's a middle-schooler,
and one of my regular students.

396
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,416
And as of now,

397
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,583
he will also be
your sparring partner.

398
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,125
[AYUMU] What? You can't
just volunteer me!

399
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,375
I've got summer school,
Master Roshi!

400
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,500
[YODANI]
Oh, c'mon, now! Be a pal!

401
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,291
I'm startin' to get the feeling
he didn't come here willingly.

402
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,750
[RINKA] Yeah, poor
little guy. And that afro!

403
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:52,833
[AYUMU growls]

404
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:54,083
[groans]

405
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:58,166
It's not an afro!
It's just naturally curly!

406
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,666
So, you wanna fight?

407
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,083
Then show me whatcha got!

408
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:38,000
