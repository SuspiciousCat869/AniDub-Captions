00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,125
The normals
hate you for existing,

160
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,625
and you're about to make
enemies with everyone here!

161
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,333
I've lost too much already.

162
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,041
And it's time to get it back.

163
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,708
[YODANI]
Well, that settles that.

164
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,083
[grunts]

165
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,083
Time to start the next stage
of my physical therapy.

166
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,750
You can still walk?

167
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,833
[RIN] What the hell?
We go through the trouble

168
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,583
of rescuing them and
no one's here to meet us.

169
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,416
[AMIE] And why's
it so dark in here?

170
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,125
[YODANI grunts, panting]

171
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,833
[AMIE] Uh!

172
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:30,666
[RINKA grunts]

173
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,166
[RIN] Oh shit!
She's still alive?

174
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,041
[YODANI yells]

175
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,000
[MALE ESPER GUARD 11C groans]

176
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,583
She shut off
the lights to keep me

177
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,375
from making eye contact,
didn't she?

178
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,250
[AMIE]
You persistent bitch! Uh!

179
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,541
Heh!

180
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,250
[AMIE yells]

181
00:11:55,875 --> 00:12:00,083
[AMIE whimpers]

182
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,875
[AMIE] Really?
With her eyes closed?

183
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,333
[groans]

184
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:07,750
[RIN]
You've got good moves.

185
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,291
But that's all you've got.

186
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,916
I saw the fish bail on your
dead body with my own eyes.

187
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,375
Tough shit for you.

188
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,625
There's no way
you're gettin' through

189
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,333
my hundred step god fist!

190
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,083
[RINKA]
I only saw her do it once,

191
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,250
but she shoots
shockwaves from her fists.

192
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,958
I've only got one chance.

193
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:27,041
Change the trajectory
before she shoots.

194
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,666
[RINKA grunts, yells]

195
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,583
[YODANI] Rinka!

196
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,958
Skull Crushing...

197
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,750
[RIN] Aah!
[RINKA] Psy-Kick!

198
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,083
[FEMALE VOICE] There's an
endless mass of land

199
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,666
in the direction of the sun.

200
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,625
I flew over a city
there while migrating

201
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,291
and came in contact
with some flying fish.

202
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,958
Ever since then, I can
read the thoughts of others.

203
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,916
That's exactly the city
that I wanna get to.

204
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,125
Can you take me?

205
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,791
[FEMALE VOICE]
Yes, I am a migratory bird,

206
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,125
so I know the way.

207
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,041
But in exchange
for my navigation,

208
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,500
I think it's fair
you help me find a mate.

209
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,208
Now when you say a mate,
you mean a lover?

210
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,708
[FEMALE VOICE]
That's the word.

211
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:17,041
I yearn to know what it means
to genuinely love another.

212
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,875
To hold their existence
more dearly than my own.

213
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,666
To be willing to give up
everything to be with them,

214
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,125
even in the face of death.

215
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,916
Yes. I want to
experience the same love

216
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,291
you have for this White Girl.

217
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,875
Why, so you can
cry over her corpse?

218
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,916
She can't be dead.

219
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,750
[KYOTARO] She's not. I've only
got Minami's word to go by.

220
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,250
And that's not enough.

221
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,916
I know she's still
alive and fighting!

222
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,333
It's time to
get moving, Pelico!

223
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,958
[PELICO] Huh? Pelico?

224
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,041
[MALE OFFICER 11H] Do they
really think it's okay

225
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,375
to release all the
detainees like this?

226
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,125
[MALE OFFICER 11I] Ya got me.
They're the only ones

227
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,750
that can take down
the terrorists.

228
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,708
Let's just hope
they follow through.

229
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,458
[RINDOU] No way in hell!

230
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,875
I'm not lettin' you
go after 'em!

231
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,166
Well, it's not up to you!

232
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,875
Do you realize
how many people will die

233
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,375
if we turn our backs on them?

234
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,708
Who gives a crap?

235
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,875
It doesn't matter if
we've got powers or not,

236
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,375
there's too damn
many of 'em to fight off!

237
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,458
The whole city
could die for all I care.

238
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:20,708
The only thing that matters
to me is your safety!

239
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,541
You never talked
like that in the past.

240
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,750
It's just not like you.

241
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,958
That was before
I watched my daughter die

242
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,833
and I can't
go through that again.

243
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,583
[RINKA gasps]

244
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,291
[RINKA]
You used to be a hero.

245
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,375
[RINDOU] Hm.

246
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,666
[RINKA]
And I looked up to you.

247
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,500
I always wanted
to be just like you.

248
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,250
You weren't just
any hero, Dad.

249
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,875
You were mine.

250
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,208
[RINDOU] Rinka.

251
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,125
[RINKA] I realize
the danger I'm facing

252
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,166
and that I might not
be able to change anything.

253
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,541
But if we don't try to
stop them from hurting people,

254
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,583
then we're just
as bad as they are.

255
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,875
Someone's gotta show the world
that espers aren't all evil.

256
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,458
No matter what,
we're still just people too!

257
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,875
[SORIMACHI] Hm...

258
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:08,375
Aw, I am so proud of you--ooh!

259
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,958
[YODANI] That's one way
to convince him.

260
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,750
[RINKA] I'm sorry,
but I've gotta do this!

261
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,250
[RINDOU]
Hold on, Rinka!

262
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,583
Don't worry, Dad!

263
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,750
I promise you
that I won't die!

264
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,708
[RINDOU]
Stubborn pain in the ass.

265
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,958
Running straight into trouble.

266
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,791
[NABESHIMA]
Pain in the ass, huh?

267
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,500
She's actin' just like you
when you were on the force.

268
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,333
Ya raised her right.

269
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,791
[RINDOU] Don't remind me.

270
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,166
[RINDOU]
Who the hell are these guys?

271
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,875
I got us some backup.

272
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,208
Every one of us thinks
your daughter's a hero

273
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,708
and we're happy to risk our
lives to help her out.

00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,416
Huh?

Please help us
and fight by our side!

[RINDOU] Mmm.

00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,958
[NABESHIMA] I know you're
retired and I'm asking a lot,

280
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,375
but we can't protect
this city on our own.

281

We're puttin'
our jobs on the line

282

and we're fine with that.

283
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,416
But we need your powers
if we're gonna stop them.

You go on and lead the way.

00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,541
do something this damn dumb.

316
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,916
[grunts]

317
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,875
[OFFICERS gasp]

318
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,916
Sounds fair to me.
I'm puttin' an end to this

319
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,458
even if it means
makin' my own miracle.

320
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,250
[ESPER F] I'll handle this.

321
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,583
[YODANI] Hm?!

322
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,875
They've got an electricity
esper waitin' for us!

323
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,166
[RINKA gasps]

324
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,333
End of the line!

325
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,666
[ESPER F] What the hell?

326
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,041
[YODANI]
A telekinetic shield, huh?

327
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,458
Not a bad power
you've been hidin' from us.

328
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,916
Wait, why are you here?

329
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,666
I thought you were
gonna join them.

330
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,500
[SORIMACHI]
I had a life too, y'know.

331
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:11,791
[CROWD cheering]

332
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:15,208
[SORIMACHI] And I want it
back just as much as you do.

333
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,958
[chuckles]

334
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,583
[RINKA chuckles softly]

335
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,875
[YODANI]
There's one miracle for ya.

336
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,916
[ESPER F groans]

337
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
[RINDOU yells]

338
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:33,083
I'm leavin' the rest
of it up to you, Rinka!

339
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,708
[RINKA yelps]

340
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,041
[NABESHIMA]
Defensive positions everyone!

341
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,666
They're coming straight for us!

342
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,500
[YODANI] And from behind!

343
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,333
[SORIMACHI] Aah!

344
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,625
[YODANI] Perfect!
We've got a clear path

345
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,625
straight to
the hostages from here!

346
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,833
[SORIMACHI] Uh.

347
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,416
[NABESHIMA] Wait a sec.

348
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,125
[NABESHIMA] I figured
you could use these about now.

349
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,333
 I've been
keeping them hidden

350
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,833
so they wouldn't
get confiscated.

351
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,583
Thank you,
Detective Nabeshima.

352
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,208
This means a lot to me.

353
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,416
[ESPER G] Ha. Y'know how much
fun they're probably havin'

354
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,708
up there in the sky?
And here we are,

355
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,583
stuck watchin' some
dumbass penguin.

356
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,333
[ESPER H]
Quit yer bitchin', already.

357
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,250
[PEGGY giggles, squeals]

358
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,750
[ESPER H] What the hell's
that kid doin'?

359
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,041
[MURASAKI]
I hope you don't mind, Dad,

360
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,500
but I've gotta use
your strike-out ball

361
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,125
from your days
in the baseball club.

362
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,333
[PEGGY] Ah?!

363
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:33,916
[yells]

364
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,166
[MURASAKI] Strike Remember!

365
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:43,083
[ESPER H yells]

366
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,333
What the hell are you doing?

367
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,791
Uh!

368
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,666
What kind of a turd
aims a gun at a kid?

369
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,291
Not half bad.

370
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,083
Ya didn't even
need me for this one.

371
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,583
--[PEGGY laughs]
--[MURASAKI] Peggy!

372
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,958
[BOTH laugh]

373
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,333
Thank goodness!

374
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,666
I'm never gonna let anything
bad happen to you again!

375
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,791
[PEGGY giggles]

376
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:04,875
Oh, hell yeah.

377
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,708
I can have him
fly me up to Parliament.

378
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,708
--[AYUMU] I'm coming, too.
--[KUROI] What?

379
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,125
Those bastards have my mother
held hostage up there.

380
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,458
You're not leavin' me.

381
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,041
No way I'm letting
Peggy out of my sight

382
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,416
after what he's been through.

383
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,833
[chirps]

384
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,625
Cool with me. You guys can
clearly handle yourselves.

385
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,458
Now let's go kick
their balls out their mouths.

386
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,000
[MALE ESPER GUARD 11E, 11F] Hm?

387
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,833
[yells]

388
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,625
This is the strike team.

389
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,583
We've reached our checkpoint
and safely secured the hostages.

390
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
[SUKESABURO] It appears that
the White Girl and her allies

391
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,375
have retrieved the hostages.

392
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,083
I'll leave you
to handle the rest.

393
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,375
I trust that you'll give
them a warm welcome.

394
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,083
Let's go, Minami.

395
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,083
[MINAMI] Wait, Father.

396
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,083
I'd rather
deal with them myself.

397
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:12,416
I've let Rinka escape
with her life too many times.

398
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,583
She's a little obsessed.

399
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,500
Are you sure
you're cool with that?

400
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,833
It's her decision to make.

401
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,125
[YODANI] Listen up.
We're about to go head to head

402
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:29,250
with the espers that're
keeping this building afloat.

403
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:32,250
Once we defeat them,
it's all up to Urushiba.

404
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:35,333
He'll have to use his powers
to put her on the ground.

405
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:37,625
It's gonna be tricky,
but it's the only way

406
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,125
to save everyone.

407
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,583
[RINKA gasps]

408
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:45,708
[RINKA] Mm.

409
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,083
Minami.

410
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,875
[KAKUNOSHIN]
I'll take care of the peons.

411
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,583
Works for me.

412
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:00,041
This time you stay dead!

413
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,875
[PEGGY] Scene 12,
"Tokyo ESP Girl." Whoa...!
