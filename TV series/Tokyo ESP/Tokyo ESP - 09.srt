00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,000
[MALE EDF 9H]
I'm sorry, sir.

322
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,750
But the esper got away from us
before we could detain her.

323
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,250
It looks like the
police have already

324
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:32,250
raided Casey's apartment.
That was our safe house.

325
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,083
What do we do now?

326
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,750
The only option we've
got is to get a hold

327
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,041
of my dad somehow.

328

[MURASAKI]
We've gotta go, Rinka.

329
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,666
[RINKA]
It's my fault.

330
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,125
So many people got hurt
because of me.

331
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:22,583
There he is!

332
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,958
Wait here and I'll
bring him over.

333
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:33,208
The White Girl is the reason why
the school was even attacked.

334
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,625
[RINKA] Anyone who gets
near me is in danger.

335
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:44,250
Even Murasaki's family.
I can't protect anyone.

336
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,958
Not anymore.

337
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:48,833
Right over here, Dad!

338
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:52,541
C'mon, Rinka, let's go. Hello?

339
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:55,625
Rinka? Where are you?

340
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,500
[EDOYAMA]
What's the matter, sweetheart?

341
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,708
Rinka was just here, but...

342
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,708
She's gone.
