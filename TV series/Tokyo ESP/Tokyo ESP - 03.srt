00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,916
Thank goodness.
I thought I'd lost him.

318
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,666
[KYOTARO]
Oh my god!

319
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,000
[RINDOU]
Huh?

320
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,583
They didn't get you.
I'm so glad.

321
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,125
[KYOTARO gasps]

322
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,333
[YOUNG KYOTARO]
Paulo!

00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,125
[YOUNG KYOTARO gasps]

324
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,375
Don't die on me! Please!

325
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,875
[RINDOU] Give me one
good reason I shouldn't

326
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,041
rearrange your face
for gettin' my daughter

327
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,791
mixed up in this crap!

328
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,500
[RINKA]
Stop it!

329
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,791
This isn't the time for
you to go all alpha male!

330
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,916
A little girl's been kidnapped.
We need a rescue plan!

331
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,625
[RINDOU grunts]

332
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,583
Well, if we knew who did it,
we'd have someplace to start.

333
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,000
[RINKA]
Hm...

334
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,041
If nothing else, we should
at least call the police,

335
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,416
don't you think?

336
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Hotokeda! That was
the ringleader's name!

337
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,791
That's all we need to know!

338
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,416
That fat bastard runs
the scene in Otsuka.

339
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,625
[KYOTARO grunts]

340
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:50,541
I'll go take care of it.
You guys stay here.

341
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,458
[RINKA]
Are you kidding me?

342
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,458
Rinka! Sweetie!

343
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:02,416
[RINKA] This is my fault.
I should've protected her.

344
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,458
They got her because
I screwed up. I failed!

345
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,416
I'm not any kind of hero.

346
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,541
God! Look at me!

347
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:13,250
I can't even stand
on my own two feet!

348
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,458
[MERAYAMA]
In ya go!

349
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:17,875
Tell me where I am!

350
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,291
What're you people
gonna do to me?

351
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,833
I'll tell ya what we're gonna do

352
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:24,375
if you don't shut that whiny
little trap o' yours, sweet pea.

353
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,708
I'll burn ya so good,
they'll have to bust out

354
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,416
dental records to I.D. ya.

355
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,250
[KUROI] So ya think
ya can sell superpowers

356
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,375
to any schmo with a wad a' cash?

357
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,875
Cause it sounds bunk to me.

358
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,791
[HOTOKEDA]
You won't care how it sounds

359
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,291
once the money
starts rollin' in.

360
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,416
But how's it even possible?

361
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,291
These little fish
are about to be

362
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,541
the hottest commodity
you've ever seen.

363
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,041
People'll lose their
minds over 'em.

364
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,833
All we need is
someone on the street

365
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,958
who knows how to push product.

366
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,541
[HOTOKEDA]
Merayama.

367
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,250
Go check out our new digs.

368
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,208
Kill anyone from the old guard.

369
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,416
I don't want any legacy costs.

370
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,583
[MERAYAMA]
Right.

371
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:15,500
[MERAYAMA gasps]

372
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,541
[MERAYAMA] You do all this
on your own, little birdie?

373
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,166
[KYOTARO] Tell me where
you're keeping the girl.

374
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,416
I've got no time for games.

375
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,041
[MERAYAMA]
You think it's that simple?

376
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,083
Clockin' a few guys
ain't enough incentive.

377
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,750
[KYOTARO]
Tell me where she is, dammit!

378
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,000
[MERAYAMA]
Ugh. Knock it off, kid.

379
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,708
Look at'cha. You ain't
held a gun before.

380
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,083
[MERAYAMA gasps]

381
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:44,291
[MERAYAMA groans]

382
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,791
[KYOTARO]
That was a warning shot.

383
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,375
Your kind has no surprises
in store for me.

384
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,125
Not since I was kid.

385
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,916
[MERAYAMA panting]

386
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,041
So you prepared for this?

387
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,583
This is some serious bullshit!

388
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,458
How the hell am I
s'posed to dodge a guy

389
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,583
who blips in and out
of thin air?

390

[MERAYAMA grunts]

391
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,625
Watch where you're goi--!

392
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,791
Long time no see, Merayama.

393
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,458
Oh shit! Old Man Urushiba!

394
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,666
You burn my apartment building
down, you son of a bitch?

395
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,333
I got no idea what
you're talkin' about,

396
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,333
I swear it!

397
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,541
[RINDOU]
Tell us where the girl is

398
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,625
or I'll launch your
sorry ass into orbit!

00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,000
Don't test me, ya little shit!

400
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,500
Thank goodness you're okay!

Little out of character for you.

402
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,541
Since when do
super heroes need guns?

403
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,333
Depends on the people
they're up against.

404
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,958
And it depends on
what's at stake.

405
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,125
Whatever you say, I guess.

[MURASAKI]
Stop being a child for once.

409

a stupid liability.

You've gotta stand up and get
yourself outta this mess!

415
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,333
[KUROI] I'm gonna go
out on a limb and guess

416
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,541
you're not exactly
from around here.

417
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,083
The hell is that rock anyway?

418
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:32,125
That how you caught all the
fish, or is that a trade secret?

419
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,916
[WINGED MASK]
There's no need for you to know.

420
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,958
The fish do what they please.

421
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:39,041
They decide everything.

422
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,416
Huh?

423
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:55,166
[MURASAKI screams]

424
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,541
[RINDOU] Alright. This is where
the sons a' bitches hide out.

425

Kid.

426
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,666
Get my daughter outta here
and take her to the bar.

427
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,041
I'll save the girl. Bastards
won't see Rindou comin'!

428
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,625
Dad, you can't
do this by yourself.

429
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,083
Some of those guys are espers!

430
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,166
I can't just sit and wait
for you to come back

431
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,166
when I know you're
in over your head.

432
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,916
[RINDOU]
Give your old man some credit.

433
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,291
Try giving your daughter
some credit for once!

434
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:21,000
You didn't train me
to be a bystander!

435
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,291
Had to play that card.

436
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,333
At least you come by that
pig-headedness honestly.

[RINKA grunts]

438
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:32,083
Now take her to the bar
like I asked you.

439
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:32,791
Cut it out!

440
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,500
[RINKA]
Oh! No way!

441
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,458
Don't just stare.

442
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,916
You got enough juice left to
teleport me inside or what?

443
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,458
You and your father
have some issues.

444
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,000
[RINKA]
Shut up.

445
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:54,833
Do we or don't we
have a responsibility?

446
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,583
You really want us to be heroes?

447
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,500
Then we gotta move, now!

448
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,291
What's gotten into you?

00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:03,041
