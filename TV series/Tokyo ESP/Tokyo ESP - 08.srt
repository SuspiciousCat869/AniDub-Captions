How am I gonna face
the other representatives?

314
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,458
I appreciate you saving my life.
I'm truly grateful that you did,

315
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:02,416
but do I deserve to
have an esper son?

316
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,916
This chose me.

317
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,166
Nobody ever asked me if I
wanted to be some weird esper.

00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,125
Wait. I know you.

322
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,416
Weren't you with Master Roshi?

[PEGGY squeaking]

324
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,791
Did you bring me something?

Ooh!

Dear Ayumu, I went back to where

328
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,458
we were attacked and
snooped around for a bit

329
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,125
until I found your glasses!

330
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,541
They were only a little
worse for wear!

331
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,833
[AYUMU]
Seriously?

332
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,875
What if she'd been
caught poking around?

333
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,416
[MURASAKI] Also, I made
some sweet cookies for you.

334
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,791
I really hope you like them!

335
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,375
P.S. Ayumu, I owe you my life

336
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,166
because you were
so cool that day.

337
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,708
You were like a total superhero,

338
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:59,208
and I swear to you that
I'll never forget it!

339
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,208
[AYUMU]
Wait, she thinks I was cool?

340
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,083
Please, we're really sorry!

341
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,833
She shouldn't have done it!

342
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,291
[AYUMU]
Nope.

343
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,000
Not cool, but she can
think whatever she wants.

344
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,875
[RINKA]
See ya later, everybody!

Have an awesome first day!

00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,833
[RINKA] Going back to
school seems so normal.

347
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,583
[RINKA] I guess that's just
because everything else

348
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,000
is so bizarre.

349
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,375
[RINKA]
And still, no sign of Kyotaro.

350
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,000
[PEGGY]
Ahh!

[RINKA gasps]

Oh my god, you're back!

00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,083
It's really you!

354
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,750
How in the heck
did you get away?

355
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,500
What about all your injuries?

356
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,625
I'm fine. They
weren't even real.

357
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,125
Tell me everything, please!

358
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,458
So, like...

359
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,416
They just all of a sudden
let you walk away?

360
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah.

361
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,250
It's like they just decided this
morning that I wasn't worth it.

362
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,291
I guess.

363
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,333
Now you're free,
but are you safe?

364
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,833
Well, Minami made it very clear

365
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,416
that I should stay out
of her way from now on.

366
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,291
It's like I never really
knew her at all.

367
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,708
I'm sorry.

368
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:05,750
But, I was so worried,
really everyone was so worried!

369
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:09,583
Why didn't you call us
the second you were freed?

370
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,625
[KYOTARO]
Because, when they let me go,

371
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,083
I just wanted to see you
as soon as possible.

372
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,583
[RINKA]
Huh?

373
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,291
[PEGGY]
Ah?

They can't even see the truth.

That nothing can
