163
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,833
and are scrambling
in an effort to figure out

164
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,375
some way of containing it.

165
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,833
For our viewers in the area,

166
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:09,416
be advised that the range
of its pull seems to be--uh!

167
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,375
Oh no!
It's on the move again!

168
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,541
[RINDOU] Rinka!

169
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,166
[BOTH groan]

170
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,875
I think we should
take cover. So uh...

171
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,541
[RINKA] I may be wrong.
But I have a hunch our powers

172
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,083
aren't active
when we're asleep.

173
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,625
So maybe. Just maybe,
if Dad loses consciousness...

174
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,541
We can curb his power before
it goes completely haywire.

175
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,791
[RINDOU] Rinka!

176
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,666
[KYOTARO]
Easier said than done.

177
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,666
How are we gonna get to him

178
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,416
without getting
ourselves killed?

179
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,458
How do you think? I can pass
through solid matter, right?

180
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,458
What? You're new to this!

181
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,041
Lose focus for a second
and you're toast!

182
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,375
I am not just
leaving him in there!

183
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:57,500
[RINKA] He's my dad. We're all
we've got in this world.

184
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:01,333
[RINDOU] Rinka!

185
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:05,333
We're a team.
He's always been there for me.

186
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:14,625
If this is a gift,
let's treat it like one!

187
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,458
Huh? Uh-oh.

188
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,875
Looks like there's
a couple of kids down there.

189
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,208
That girl's hair.
It's so white.

190
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,625
[RINDOU] Rinka!

191
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,708
What the--?

192
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,958
[RINKA yells]

193
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,333
[RINDOU] Rin--!

194
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:47,750
[RINKA]
Skull Crushing Psy-Kick!

195
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,541
Behold the miracle!

196
00:12:58,916 --> 00:12:59,791
[KYOTARO]
You're even more amazing

197
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,500
than I'd thought you'd be.

198
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,000
Now hold on tight.

199
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,333
[RINKA] Wait, what the--?

200
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,375
How'd we get here?

201
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,750
Was this you?

202
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,083
[KYOTARO] Yep, my power
is Teleportation.

203
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,166
Uh.

204
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,833
But I still need
quite a bit of practice.

205
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,625
Who the hell are you?

206
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,875
Oh, sorry, I'm Kyotaro Azuma.

207
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,250
And just like you and
your father, I'm an esper.

208
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,833
Welcome to the life.

209
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,791
[groans]

210
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,000
[RINDOU] What's going on?

211
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,416
Uh!

212
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,875
I could really use
an explanation for this crap.

213
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,666
Whatever you remember about
yesterday, try not to freak.

214
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,166
What're ya talkin' 'bout?

215
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,250
Only thing I recall from
the last twenty-four hours

216
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,375
is gettin' kicked in the head.

217
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,958
That part must've
been a dream!

218
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,541
Look, don't worry about this,
think of it like a cold.

219
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,333
A little R an' R
and you'll be back to normal.

220
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,375
All right, I've gotta
pick up a shift at the café.

221
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,208
Stay comfortable
and don't go outside.

222
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,958
Yeah, sure. Ooh!

223
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,416
If Dad knew
he caused all this

224
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,458
he'd have a
full-blown panic attack.

225
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,916
I need to help him figure out
how to control his power.

226
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,708
[FEMALE OFFICER 2A]
Officer Nabeshima!

227
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,625
[FEMALE OFFICER 2A]
We've got several witnesses.

228
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,916
Any solid leads?

229
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,666
Yes. In fact, get this.

230
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,375
They all corroborate the
existence of an albino girl

231
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,083
who dropped through the cars.

232
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,416
[NABESHIMA] Well that's
definitely something.

233
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,083
[FEMALE OFFICER 2A] Yeah.

234
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,291
[NABESHIMA] Hmmm.

235
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,125
[FEMALE OWNER 2A]
Order up, sweetie. Table six.

236
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,750
[RINKA] Yes, ma'am.

237
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,541
No! What do you think
you're doing here?

238
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,166
What a crazy coincidence!

239
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,083
Do you think I'm an idiot?

240
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,416
You could've at least
come through the door.

241
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,166
[KYOTARO] I'm sorry.

242
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,625
I was just worried
and I wanted to see

243
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,541
how you were doing.

244
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,166
[RINKA] Hot, hot, hot!

245
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,208
[sighs]

246
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,750
[NABESHIMA] Excuse us, miss.
A moment of your time?

247
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,416
My partner and I are here with
the Ueno Police Department.

248
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,916
We've got some questions.

249
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,625
[RINKA gasps]

250
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,791
Didn't take them
very long, did it?

251
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,708
Oh man, I am so busted!

252
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,166
Why're you on the floor?

253
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,583
Shhh!

254
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,750
[NABESHIMA] We were hoping
you could shed some light

255
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,833
on the Black Fist case for us.

256
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:03,500
Nothing to worry about,
purely a matter of routine.

257
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:08,125
Oh thank god. They're not
looking for me after all.

258
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,916
Are you talking about
that thief?

259
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,875
The creepy fella from the news?

260
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,333
[NABESHIMA] Correct.

261
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,583
[NABESHIMA] The suspect
has already burglarized

262
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:20,166
half a dozen jewelry stores
and several area museums.

263
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,000
Darned if we can't get
a positive ID

264
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:25,375
on the squirrelly so-and-so,
or puzzle out his methods.

265
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,583
Quite the cipher, this one.

266
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:31,041
[MALE OFFICER 2A groans]

267
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,833
[groans]

268
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,875
[NABESHIMA] When cornered,
he dissolves into thin air.

269
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,833
Like a fog.

270
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,458
[NABESHIMA] Anyway, if anything
suspicious catches your eye,

271
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,333
don't hesitate to call us.

272
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,166
Of course.

273
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,000
Now why do you
suppose they came here?

274
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,458
Surely they
don't imagine the thief

275
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,208
has his sights
on my cutlery?

276
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,166
[gasps]

277
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,583
Wait a minute.

278
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,291
I betcha he's plannin' to
hit the museum next door.

279
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,333
Yeah. With all the jewelry

280
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,916
and stuff they put on exhibit
yesterday, that'd be my pick.

281
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,208
[RINKA] Huh.

282
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:20,000
What the? Kyotaro?

283
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,708
Surely not.

284
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,208
[RINKA gasps] Whoa!
This place is a fortress.

285
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:37,708
Guess she was on point.
They do expect a hit.

286
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,958
[RINKA] If Kyotaro's
dumb enough to steal,

287
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,041
it's best I get to him first.

288
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,333
He spills the beans
about me and Dad to the cops,

289
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,291
things are gonna
get complicated.

is a Miracle, huh?

298
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,125
How in the hell is
being a crook miraculous?

299
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,458
[KYOTARO]
It's not what you think!

300
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,000
I didn't do any of this!
I mean, how could I have?

301
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,333
You obviously
got here before I did!

302
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:52,083
Oh. Guess you've got a point.

303
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,291
Keep your eyes peeled.
I've got a pretty good feeling

304
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,458
the culprit
is still among us.

305
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,000
[RINKA] What?

306
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,000
Look over there.

307
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,208
Thieves don't typically
leave the riches behind.

Are we gonna have to

310

go through the whole
good-guy bad-guy shtick again?

311
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,875
Or have you gone
a little soft in the head

312
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,958
from the beating
I gave you last time?

a name for myself here.

And I can't say I appreciate you
stealing my thunder, bird-boy.

You're kidding me. Who is she?

Allow me to introduce you to
the actual Black Fist.

[RINKA] What are you doing?

319
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,250
Look at your life. Is this
what you want for yourself?

320
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,416
You've been endowed
with a precious gift.

321
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,291
Why waste it amassing
ill-gotten gains?

322
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,958
[KUROI]
Yeah, spare me the lecture.

323
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,875
I'm endowed with the power
to do what I damn well please.

324
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,500
You say it's a waste,
I say it's mine.

325
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,458
Take a look at your life.

326
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:02,333
Sure. I'm a thief,
but you're a goddamn pest!

327
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,208
[RINKA] Where did she go?

328
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,750
[KYOTARO] Oh, boy. Not good.

329
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,458
If you haven't put
two and two together yet,

330
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,791
she's also an esper.

331
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,041
And her power just happens
to be invisibility.

332
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,125
[KYOTARO] Unfortunately,
she's also an ex-pro

333
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,375
feather weight boxer as--uuuh!

334
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,666
Kyotaro!

335
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,625
Are you one of this
asshole's loser friends?

336
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,875
[KUROI grunts]

337
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:39,375
Oh-ho! Someone's able to
pass through solid objects!

338
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,166
How cool is that?

339
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,541
I'm gonna go out
on a limb and say

340
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,583
you came into contact
with the floating fishies.

341
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,833
[RINKA] I hope you've got the
cash to reimburse the museum

342
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,083
for this piece.

343
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,458
Ugh.

344
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,500
You've been hangin'
around the bird-boy too much.

345
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,791
Less talky, more punchy.

346
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,125
I respond better to fights
than guilt trips.

347
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,458
[gasps]

348
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,458
And it ain't like
I need to "reimburse" them

349
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,041
if I don't get caught.

350
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,958
[RINKA] Stop it.

351
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,708
You're destroying history.

352
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,833
These are the traces
of human lives,

353
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,583
our only tie with people
who're long gone.

354
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,250
If you want them for
yourself, fine. Whatever.

355
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,750
But at least
show them some respect!

356
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,458
Every time you
dodge me I'm gonna break

357
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,458
one more precious tie
to the past!

358
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:30,375
Oh, so close!
Say goodnight, sweetheart!

359
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:33,875
[KYOTARO groans]

360
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:37,333
Gotcha! You're finally
in my grasp!

361
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:46,708
[RINKA]
Skull Crushing Psy-Kick!

362
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,083
That's him!

363
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,875
Look alive boys,
that's our thief!

364
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,458
[KYOTARO] Lawmen.
Your attention please!

365
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,500
You've all been deceived!
This woman is the culprit!

366
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,583
I give you...
the real Black Fist!

367
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,000
Well then who the hell
are you supposed to be?

368
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,083
[KYOTARO]
You may call me Crow Head!

369
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,916
A new hero. For a new age!

370
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,375
[gasps]

371
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,666
[KYOTARO] We should go.

372
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,000
Until we meet again, gents!

373
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,708
[OFFICERS gasp]

374
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,250
[KYOTARO]
Power always comes at a cost.

375
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,833
We have to wield
our gifts responsibly.

376
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:33,750
Espers have a duty.
It's our job to protect people.

377
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,875
And to keep
our own kind in check.

378
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,708
At least
that's what I believe.

379
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:41,125
Join up with me.

380
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,625
Do some good
with the miracle.

381
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,375
Please.

382
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,791
[KYOTARO] There're gonna be
more and more people out there

383
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,083
who've been touched
by these glowing fish.

384
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,833
Unfortunately, that means
there are gonna be

385
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:02,875
more people we'll have
to defend the world against.

386
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,875
