00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,791
[grunts]

2
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,083
[gasps]

3
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,208
Well, crap. You got skills.

4
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,208
And I'm not gonna go easy
on you just 'cuz you're a girl!

5
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:48,166
[RINKA]
Oh, man. He can really move.

6
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,583
[grunts]

7
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,666
[YODANI] I suggest treating
this like a real battle.

8
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,000
And by the way,
if you actually hit him.

9
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,375
I'll buy you a steak!

10
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,750
Seriously? Oh god!

11
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,166
Did you forget that
we're sparring?

12
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,125
Try to give me a
little respect here.

13
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,791
Y'know, I came all
the way down here.

14
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,333
You could at least attempt
to stay focused.

15
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,916
Ugh.

16
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,291
[AYUMU]
Is that your serious stance?

17
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,041
Bring it, White Girl!

18
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,583
[grunts]

19
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,916
Master Roshi's spoken
pretty highly of you.

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,875
[RINKA yelps]

21
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,625
He completely blocked her.

22
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,166
And the media sure seems
to think you're hot shit.

23
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,083
[RINKA]
Whoa! His reflexes are nuts!

24
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,333
But if this is the best
that you can do...

25
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,875
[RINKA]
Ow!

26
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,750
...and you plan to take
on those terrorists,

27
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,208
then you'll die.

28
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,666
[RINKA]
What's with him?

29
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,291
It's like he's dodging my
attacks before I make them.

30
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,125
It's sad that the idea
of steak is enough

31
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,750
to make you lose
your concentration!

32
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,000
[AYUMU] This training is
wasted on someone like you!

33
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,333
You're helpless!

34
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:23,041
Like a child!

35
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,083
Careful, Rinka!

36
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,875
[PEGGY squeaks]

37
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,291
[grunts]

38
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,833
[AYUMU] And you? You wanna
take a shot, little girl?

39
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,916
Think ya can last any
longer than she did?

40
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,750
Don't piss yourself.
I'm just screwin' with ya.

41
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,041
[MURASAKI sighs]

42
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,791
I wouldn't waste my time.

43
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,833
A sneeze would
probably kill you.

44
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:04,541
I'm heading home.
I've got some studying to do.

45
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:12,416
[PEGGY coos]

46
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,333
[RINKA]
It's so weird.

47
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,208
It's not like he's faster
than Master Roshi.

48
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:24,875
But he moves like he already
knows what I'm gonna do next.

49
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,833
Wait, a minute...

50
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,500
He caught it
without even looking!

51
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,083
[PEGGY]
Waah.

52
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,666
Just as I thought.

53
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,833
Don't attack unless
you're really gonna hit.

54
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,500
What just happened?
I'm confused.

55
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,291
He didn't try to deflect it.

56
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,208
He didn't even flinch
because he already knew

57
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,833
I wasn't actually gonna hit him.

58
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,458
Are you saying...?

59
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,916
[RINKA]
Yep. He's gotta be an esper.

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,208
He's just like us.

61
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,750
[MURASAKI]
What? Precognition?

62
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,166
But I've got a hunch
that he can't really see

63
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,750
all that far into the future.

64
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,041
Really? What gives
you that idea?

65
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,875
[RINKA] Because he wasn't
expecting us to ambush him

66
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,125
on his way home.

67
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,750
Seems like he would've
chosen a different path

68
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,958
to avoid us if he could
see that far ahead.

69
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,166
[MURASAKI]
Yeah. Good point.

70
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,541
[RINKA]
If I had to guess.

71
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,375
His vision of the future
is probably always active,

72
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,958
mixing with the present.

73
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:46,958
[MURASAKI]
So then,

74
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,666
how do you beat
someone like that?

75
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,625
[RINKA] No matter how much
he knows what's coming.

76
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,375
There's gotta be
some point where he just

77
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,916
can't avoid an attack.

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,041
In other words,

79
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,541
I have to overcome
his reaction speed.

80
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,166
Which means I have to perfect
the hundred fist punch!

81
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,708
[PEGGY, MURASAKI yelp]

82
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,333
[RINKA]
Hundred Fist Punch!

83
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,791
Uh. I don't think
that's a real thing.

84
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,125
Well, not yet.

85
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,250
[MURASAKI]
Sure.

86
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,416
[panting]

87
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,791
[AYUMU]
If that's enough to make you

88
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,208
lose your concentration,

89
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,541
then you're too helpless
to even bother with training.

90
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,750
[RINKA]
I am not helpless.

91
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,000
[RINKA]
But, if I can't even beat him...

92
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,666
[RINKA] ...there's no way
I can beat Minami.

93
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,916
[YODANI] People's thoughts
can overwhelm them

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,375
when they hit a wall.

95
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,375
They become distressed
when they cannot

96
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,166
puzzle out an answer.

97
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,208
So how is one able to succeed

98
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,333
when their thoughts
are of no use to them?

99
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,750
And no clear answer exists?

100
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,750
You simply don't think.

101
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,041
You push right on
through the wall.

102
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:14,125
[YODANI] Hoh. The girl's
a quick learner, isn't she?

103
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,208
[YODANI] The secret of C.P.C.
lies in the counter offense.

104
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,625
No matter their speed,
your opponent's attack

105
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,875
will create an opening.

106
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,916
[YODANI]
Only attack once they attack.

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,333
Use their own force
and strength against them

108
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,916
in a grappling counter.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,833
Repeat the move
thousands of times

110
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,875
until it's drilled
into your mind.

111
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,125
Train your body to
remember the timing

112
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,416
until you can
respond instinctively.

113
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,916
Repeat it over and over until
your body moves on its own

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,791
without thought.

115
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,791
Please, you know I love you.

116
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,291
Just stop. You can't
do this to me, Taro.

117
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,583
 I'm a married woman.

118
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,166
[JIRO] That cretin
doesn't deserve the love

119
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,791
of a woman like you.

120
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,333
[HANAKO]
Stop.

121
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,083
So my ESP's
only contact based.

122
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,625
It's like I can't even feel it
unless I'm touching something.

123
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,541
[PEGGY coos]

124
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,875
[MURASAKI]
Get out of there, Peggy.

125
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,750
Rinka's bag is not a play pen.

126
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,375
[PEGGY]
Ooh?

127
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,250
That's weird, she left
her nightstick behind.

128
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,208
Hm...

129
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,250
How am I now just
coming up with the idea

130
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,958
to use my ESP on a weapon?

131
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,916
[MURASAKI yelps]

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
[HANAKO]
Taro, I'm sorry!

133
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,458
[REIA] Ayumu. How are your
studies coming along?

134
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,833
There's no better
time than summer

135
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,750
to blow past the other kids.

136
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,416
Yeah.

137
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,166
[REIA] Don't go easy
on yourself just because

138
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,583
you're in middle school.

139
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,208
You'll be applying for
colleges before you know it.

140
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,166
[AYUMU] What about you,
Mom, how've you been?

141
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,958
The election's right
around the corner.

142
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,541
[REIA]
I know.

143
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,208
That's why it's important that
I can sell the country my plan

144
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,125
to deal with these
awful terrorists.

145
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,625
We have to take our nation
back for our people.

146
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:28,041
My proposal is the only
way we can truly be safe.

147
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,416
I guess.

148
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,291
[REIA] Goodness, these
espers are such demons.

149
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,041
The world would be
better off without them.

150
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,750
[AYUMU] I've got other things
I could be doing, y'know.

151
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,958
Make a move already!

152
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,833
[AYUMU] What's with you?
Let's just get this over with.

153
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,250
I don't wanna catch a cold.

154
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,833
[AYUMU]
She's just standing there.

155
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:04,833
I guess she's decided to
abandon the offensive strategy.

156
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,708
And this is bound to be
a different fight

157
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,416
now that she knows
about my powers.

158
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,083
Last time she had assumed
it was a normal sparring match.

159
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,958
No matter how many
outcomes I can see.

160
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,958
Her power keeps
screwing up the variables.

161
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,208
[AYUMU]
On top of that.

162
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,666
She's got a counter move
prepared for every attack

163
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,333
I can think of.

164
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,916
[AYUMU] But we're just gonna
stand here all day at this rate.

165
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,375
[AYUMU yells]

166
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,791
[AYUMU]
As long as I know it's coming,

167
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,875
I can still counter her counter!

168
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,000
[RINKA yells]

169
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,500
[AYUMU grunts]

170
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,958
[AYUMU] If I can see it,
then I can stop it!

171
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,916
[AYUMU]
A kick won't work!

172
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,416
[YODANI] He can think ahead
as many moves as he wants.

173
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,375
But his body simply can't keep
up with all of the possible

174
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,833
future permutations
that he sees.

175
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,833
[AYUMU yells]

176
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,833
[YODANI] The quicker he thinks,
the slower he gets.

177
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,791
[AYUMU]
Ow, shit!

178
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,958
[YODANI] Rinka is responding
instinctively to his attacks.

179
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,500
Even if he could see
a thousand moves ahead,

180
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,875
she'd counter all of them.

181
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,791
[RINKA]
C.P.C. Secret Technique!

182
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,333
[AYUMU groans]

183
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,500
[RINKA]
Thousand Hand Counter!

184
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,041
[YODANI]
He's had enough!

185
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,041
Man. I knew I shouldn't
have attacked first.

186
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,166
[YODANI] I'm impressed
with how far you've come

187
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,000
in such a short time, Rinka.

188
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,000
[RINKA] Thank you for your
guidance, Master Roshi.

189
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,541
[YODANI]
It wasn't just me.

190
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,541
You had many of the necessary
skills from the years

191
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,750
your father spent training you.

192
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,458
You're right.

193
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,666
[YODANI]
As for you.

194
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,541
Your body just can't
keep up with your mind.

195
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,458
Don't give me that crap!
That was a fluke.

196
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,708
I just had my
guard down, that's all!

197
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,375
I'll kick her ass next time.

198
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,000
There's no way I'm gonna
lose to a girl more than once.

199
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,958
[MURASAKI]
You really think so?

200
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,500
Let's test it out.

201
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,958
Unless you're too scared.

202
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,916
Is that why you
haven't fought me?

203
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,916
Well, this seems
out of character.

204
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,208
Fair warning though.

205
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,000
Keep your guard up
so you don't get hurt.

206
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,375
Y'see, my dad's a
kung-fu movie fanatic

207
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,291
and he bought these
nunchucks at an auction.

208
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,166
You wanna guess who owned them?

209
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,833
[AYUMU]
You're joking, right?

210
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,916
The weapon can't win
the fight for you--

211
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,375
[MURASAKI] Hwaaa! Ha!
[AYUMU yells]

212
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,750
[YODANI] Her body's much
faster than his mind!

213
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,166
[MURASAKI]
Dragon Remember!

214
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,541
What the hell was that?

215
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,291
[RINKA, YODANI]
It was a miracle!

216
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,125
[PEGGY]
Uwaah?

217
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,375
[KYOTARO groans]

218
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,791
[KYOTARO groans]

219
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,666
[panting]

220
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,291
[MINAMI]
It's pointless.

221
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,000
[MINAMI]
He already told you.

222
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,166
He overwrote the
destination in your mind.

223
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,375
All you're doing
is wearing yourself out.

224
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,083
You're not going
to escape this room.

225
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,916
You're still going
through with this?

226
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's terrorism.

227
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,541
Of course. Why would we stop?

228
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,208
We've only just started.

229
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,916
Everything we've
worked so hard for

230
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,125
has finally begun.

231
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,083
Minami...

232
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,208
[KYOTARO]
It's sad.

233
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,041
I wish you could see
things differently.

234
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,916
If only you had someone
who could've saved you

235
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,541
from all of this.

236
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,916
[KYOTARO]
The same way that I was saved.

237
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,250
Then maybe you could
see that justice

238
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,458
doesn't come from hatred.

239
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,833
[KYOTARO]
Uh--

240
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,333
Terrorism.

241
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,666
Do you know where
the word comes from?

242
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,833
[KYOTARO]
Huh?

243
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,333
[MINAMI] It was first
coined in France.

244
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,833
It's the use of fear
as a political tool.

245
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:33,125
You and I are no strangers
to that kind of fear.

246
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,708
My parents and your mom.

247
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,250
They all died for
someone else's political gain.

248
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,000
[MINAMI] There are times
I almost trick myself

249
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,208
into thinking that none
of it really happened.

250
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,541
It's like I turn my mind off

251
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,333
and float through
every normal boring day.

252
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:47,666
It's strange.

253
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,458
It almost feels like I'm
outside the flow of time.

254
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,833
[KYOTARO] You may not feel
the passage of time, but...

255
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,375
But it's still affecting you.

256
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,875
I can see you
changing with every day.

257
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,000
[MINAMI]
How have I changed?

258
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,750
Huh? Well it's hard to explain.

259
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,208
But you just seem more mature.

260
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,041
Even though we're the same age,

261
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,208
I can't help but feel like
I'm getting left behind.

262
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,833
[KYOTARO]
Minami.

263
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:28,416
I refuse to change
the way that you have.

264
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,416
If growing up means
becoming like you,

265
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,125
I'd rather stay a kid.

266
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,750
[REIA]
These espers are a plague.

267
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,875
They will destroy every last
vestige of our society,

268
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,458
unless we can
put a stop to them.

269
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,333
We need to round up every
last one of these monsters,

270
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,875
research them and protect
our peaceful way of life.

271
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,625
We must band together
to defeat this menace.

272
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,666
And stand with our
hearts as one.

273
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,041
Let's make them regret
their acts of terrorism.

274
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,750
[AYUMU] I doubt her
campaign would go so hot

275
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,916
if people knew her kid
was an esper.

276
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,916
I know she'd
certainly be shocked.

277
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,875
[MURASAKI]
Oh. Hey, Ayumu.

278
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,000
Nunchucks girl!

279
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,541
What the heck're you
doing down here?

280
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,750
I'm just heading over
to my dad's house.

281
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,875
I'm actually gonna
take these back to him.

282
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,333
But you can't fight without
those things, right?

283
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,166
Are you giving up the hero game?

284
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,750
Of course not.

285
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,333
But moving like a master at this
level is just too hard on me.

286
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,416
I can't really keep it up for
much more than twenty seconds.

287
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,875
It basically feels like
I'm kicking my own butt.

288
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:43,541
My whole body aches
like a truck hit me.

289
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,250
So y'know. I figured
I'll take a look

290
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,416
and see what other
weapons my dad has.

291
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,125
I'll borrow something that's
a little more my speed.

292
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,708
[AYUMU] Sounds like you
get along pretty well

293
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:52,458
with your family.

294
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,541
Huh? What was that?

295
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,166
Forget it, it was nothing.

296
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,875
But lemme ask you this.
You're still just a kid,

297
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,041
so why do you feel the
need to fight so badly?

298
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:03,958
What's my reason?

299
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,583
I don't have one in particular.

300
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:06,750
[AYUMU]
What?

301
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,708
I fight 'cuz it's
the right thing to do.

302
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,958
[AYUMU]
Oh, man, you're so naïve.

303
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,583
We can fight for
justice all we want.

304
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,583
But that doesn't mean this
world's ever gonna accept us.

305
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,750
[BOTH gasp]

306
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,500
[SAKAMOTO grunts]

307
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,541
[AYUMU]
An explosion? Wait.

308
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:28,166
This is a premonition.
There's still time!

309
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,666
[MURASAKI] Uh...
[AYUMU gasps]

310
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,083
Get down, right now!

311
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,208
[MURASAKI]
What?

312
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,583
[SAKAMOTO]
This is Divine Retribution!

313
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,791

Of course he's an esper.

My god. They're all dead!

317
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,416
Stand up, bigot.

318
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:12,541
Don't fight. You did
this to yourself.

319
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,583
[AYUMU gasps]

320
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,166
You are nothing more
than a parasite

321
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,416
that feeds on the
weak and the uneducated.

322
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,125
Politicians like you have filled
this world with suffering.

323

[screams]

324
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,666
Mom!

325
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,291
Well here's your chance
to suffer for a change.

326
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,125
No. Leave her alone!

327
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,500
My leg! I twisted it!

328
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,375
Why'd this have to happen now?

329
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,833
Agh!

330
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,041
[gasps]

331
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,166
Are you crazy?
That guy'll kill you!

332
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,416
That freakin' hurt.

333
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,125
Which one of you swine
threw that at me?

334
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,125
[AYUMU] What'd I tell you?
He's gonna murder us!

335
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,125
Get away from that
woman right now!

336
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,208
What?

337
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,541
Step back or I'll
throw another one.

338
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,500
Oh, yeah?

339
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,541
So you actually
admit you threw it.

340
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,000
Little bitch.

341
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,958
If you think I won't kill
you just 'cuz you're a kid,

342
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,041
you're dead wrong!

343
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,208

00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,041
[AYUMU]
Murasaki!

345
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,791
Wait! That didn't just happen.

346
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,291
It's the future.

347
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,875
[MURASAKI] Get away from
that woman right now!

348
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,416
Step back or I'll
throw another one.

349
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,208
Oh, yeah?

350
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,583
So you actually
admit you threw it.

351
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,958
Wait, no, please,
just wait a second!

352
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,916
Please, we're really sorry!

353
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,083
She shouldn't have done it!

354
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,625
It was wrong, and I swear,
we're so sorry!

355
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,000
Please forgive us!

356
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,625
[MURASAKI]
What're you doing?

357
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:46,708
[SAKAMOTO]
Heh.

358
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,000
[AYUMU]
I promise, I won't let her do

359
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:53,000
anything that stupid again!
Say you're sorry!

360
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,208
This guy shoots electricity
out of his hands.

361
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,791
You're gonna be instantly
cremated if he hits you.

362
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,916
Yeah, but, he's about
to kill that woman.

363

possible future suck?!

367
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,375
[AYUMU]
Excuse me, sir!

368
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,208
I don't think you
wanna do that.

369
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,375
[SAKAMOTO]
Why the hell not?

370
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,875
Listen. Kid.

371
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,666
The last thing you wanna do
is try to play hero with me.

372
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,500
Uh...

373
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,958
[AYUMU]
Don't do it!

374
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,500
[MURASAKI]
But...

375
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,708
[SAKAMOTO] I don't trust all
this whispering you're doing.

376
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,416
Say goodbye to your afro.

377
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,666
And the rest of your head.

378
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,625
[AYUMU]
I do not have an afro.

379
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,208
Just calm down, alright?

380
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,583
You don't wanna kill
a fellow esper, do you?

381
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,041
You're an esper?

382
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,416
[AYUMU]
I don't have a choice.

383
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,833
I gotta stop him somehow.

384
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,750
My only chance is to
deflect the electricity

385
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,250
with my belt buckle.

386
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,541
But...

387
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,625
[AYUMU grunts]

388
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,500
[AYUMU] Every future
scenario has me missing

389
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,166
and dying if I try that.

390
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,375
[AYUMU] What do I do?
Think of something.

391
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:09,375
Everyone's gonna die if I don't.

392
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,083
One small thing can
change everything.

393
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,333
But what? Think!

394
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,625
So you're telling me
you're a chosen one?

395
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,166
You better not be
lying to me, kid.

396
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,875
[AYUMU]
Something. Anything, dammit!

397
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,458
Something that can
alter the future!

Whoa!

[AYUMU]
Well, crap. I still got shocked.

409
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,583
[MURASAKI] Me, too. I don't
think I can move my body.

410
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,375
Do you wanna die
before you finish

411
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,083
elementary school?

412
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,166
That was really
freaking reckless.

413
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,583
It had to be done.

414
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:32,541

what a hero's gotta do.

I need to know.

Are you really one of them?

Please don't tell me
you're an esper.
