I'm so happy you can

Wow. Can you
believe this, Rinka?

I miss you.

[RINKA] They beat me down,

But now I'm not even sure why.

28
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,791
Espers have a duty.

It's our job to protect people.

30
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,416
[RINKA]
I believed it was our duty.

That we had to be the ones
to stop the Professor.

32

But then...

33
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,500
[RINKA] Did I really
protect anyone?

34
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,416
And will I even be able
to help without my powers?

I know I'm not
cut out to be a hero.

Because everything
I had is gone.

You promised you'd never
leave me behind,

it's hopeless without you.

You were this close to it.

If I was supposed to die,
I don't understand

why you've saved me twice now.

That's what my father wanted.

57
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,750
But I had to trust my feelings.

58
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,041
[gasps] So you have
feelings when it's me?

59
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,000
Did you feel anything for all
the other people you killed?

[SORIMACHI] Hm?

74
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,833
All these prisoners
are espers.

00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,458
How can they get away with this?

76
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,291
[YODANI] By calling it
a detainment center

77
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,041
instead of a jail.

78
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,625
Despite the prison aesthetic,
it's surprisingly comfortable.

79
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,041
[RINKA]
They got you, too?

80
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,750
[YODANI] Yeah, I couldn't run
after they tranked me.

81
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,666
So I'm stuck in this chair
for the time being.

Will your legs be okay?

00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,000
[YODANI]
It's of no concern.

00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:22,291
I'm simply relieved to see
you're alive and in one piece.

00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,916
[YODANI] We all get
to sit around up here,

89
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,708
feeling sorry for ourselves,
but those with powers

90
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,250
like teleportation,
fire, and electricity

91
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,166
can't be controlled so well.

92

They're all locked up
and under forced sedation.

[RINKA]
Uh... That's horrible.

if you get too close to him.

00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,458
Oh. If he's that dangerous,
why don't you just lemme

99
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,291
go ahead and
kill him to be safe?

100
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,458
Uh-uuh!

101
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,791
That's thoughtful of you,
but I would have

102
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,375
killed him already
if it didn't mean

103
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,875
releasing the fish
he's captured.

104
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,541
It could be very bad if
those fish found new hosts.

105
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,625
Much less is risked by
keeping him prisoner.

106
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,333
[KOZUKI] Heh.

107
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,625

[sighs]

109
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,625
[KOZUKI] And this big gold box
over here is supposed to be

110
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,750
the source of our powers?

111
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,708
[KOZUKI] It looks like a replica
prop from a movie I saw

112
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:36,458
about the uh,
the Ark of the Covenant.

113

Astute observation, Kozuki.

114
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,250
But I can assure you
it's not a replica.

115

[KOZUKI] Huh?

116
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,333
[PROFESSOR] Many people
assume the Ark is just a myth,

[KYOTARO]
What are you saying?

119
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,125
Both our families were caught
in soldiers' crossfire!

120

They were victims of
some goddamn civil war!

00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,833
Sure, that's the
official version.

00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,166
But no one's ever
told you the truth.

Yeah, the dig
needs us both, kiddo,

127

and it could take a while.

We'll be back
before you can miss us.

And you know,

this discovery is
going to be tremendous.

131

We'll probably be
famous after this!

It's that cool?

You really did it!

139
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,125
We are looking at the
true Ark of the Covenant!

140
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,666
Yes. But, General,
there's more to learn,

141
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,375
like who brought it
here and how they...

142
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,958
[GENERAL]
You and your research!

143
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,875
It's obvious God brought this
here for us to find!

144
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,791
You've read the Old Testament.

145
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,500
This is none other than the
legendary weapon of gospel

146
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,666
that brought down
the walls of Jericho!

No, wait!

161

Mm. No, I'm all right.

162
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,583
What happened?

163
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:37,083
[JUTARO] Uh! General
Pompous Ass screwed our dig.

164

That idiot just shattered

166
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,916
[PROFESSOR] Shit.

167
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,458
But, what came out of it?

168
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,791
It looked like flying,
glowing goldfish.

169
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,291
Then they swam through us.

170

Say what?

171
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,541
Wait. Are you saying that
you didn't see the fish?

172
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,375
They're the only reason
we lost consciousness

173
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,875
in the first place.

174
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,541
Uh, sure, guys.

175
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,708
I figured you passed out
from the shock of seeing

176
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,625

[JUTARO] Uh--

196
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,958
Interesting.
You can experience

197
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,666
the illusion touching
you physically.

198
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,958
But it can't
leave an actual mark.

199
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,500
[PROFESSOR] As I suspected,
those fish have somehow

200
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,333
changed our bodies
fundamentally.

201
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,083
It seemed like
a hallucination,

202
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,750
but if not, then what
principle animates it?

203
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,416
Are we different forever?

Look at you. You're gonna
get more wrinkles.

This is simply astonishing,

[PROFESSOR] General.

210

Your report
reads like a dream!

I can hardly
believe it, Professor!

212
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,416
So. I need to know
how to obtain these powers,

213
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
so I can be
a part of this dream!

214
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:27,750
It remains unclear.

215
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,625
I recommend we convene
a neutral panel

216

of international scientists.

217

[GENERAL]
No, we can't have that.

218
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,375
This research will be
exclusively contained here.

--[KYOKA, SAIRA, JUTARO gasp]
--[PROFESSOR] What?

220
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,541
The Ark will not
be leaving my country.

00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,500
And I will have that power.

222
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,791
Until I do, none of you
will be permitted to leave.

223
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:47,125
[WASHIBANA] I'm sure the general
will be happy to reconsider.

224
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,666
[GENERAL]
Explain this. Who are you?

225
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,375
[PROFESSOR] I had a feeling
you might do this.

226
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,375
So I called an attaché
from Japan to represent us.

227
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,875
What?

228
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,916
Hello there. I'm from the
Department of Foreign Affairs.

My name's Washibana.

Don't be naïve.

234
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,583
It's impossible to think the
General's mind can be changed.

235
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,708
Involving the diplomat
may have damned us.

236
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,458
I think we're in real danger.

237
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,375
And all of you should prepare
to leave for Japan, right away.

Don't you realize we'll
lose the ark if we leave?

00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,875
Yes, but... I must
consider your lives as well.

about the Ark.

[PROFESSOR] Ultimately,
he was expendable, too.

325
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:42,250
And the truth was
lost with his life.

Why did it happen? Why?

The world is sick!

[GENERAL] W-Wait!
It was Washibana! He did it!

He planned the massacre
of your people!

has already tied up
that loose end.

There are plans
we know nothing about.

Some puppet master

346

So I'll use the remaining
tablet to draw him out,

347
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,833
then I'll kill him slowly.

This insane world will
come to the end it deserves.

Soon.

374

[MINAMI] They were murdered.
My mother, your parents.

375

They were taken from us.

376
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:56,583
You want revenge.
But what would that even do?

377
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,125
Our families are gone
and there's no way

378
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,875
that we can
ever bring them back!

379
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,458
[MINAMI]
I'm well aware of that.

[KYOTARO] Uh...

381
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,916
But can you honestly
tell me you're going to

382
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,958
forgive the people
who murdered your parents?

383
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,333
I--no, I can't.

384
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,333
Take a good look
deep inside yourself.

385
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,416
Can you really stand there
and tell me revenge is wrong?

386
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,291
Damnit!

387
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,083
What would Rinka do?

388
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:23,208
She'd follow her heart. But how?

389
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,333
[RINKA] Y'know,
people like those douchebags

390
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:27,416
really piss me off.

Uh--

392
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
They were
the douchebags, right?

Uh-huh.

00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:36,416
Well that's a relief!

395

[KYOTARO chuckles]
Can't argue with that!

[KYOTARO moans]

397
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,416
We can't let the douchebags
control the world.

398
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,541
There's no way. And Rinka would
give her life to stop them.

399
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,791
For sure. Right?
