to live on the street.

318
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:05,125
I'll repay this debt someday,
I promise you that.

319
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,625
Runaway, huh?

320
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,916
I did that a time
or three myself!

321
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,375
Don't you worry home-girl.
I'll show ya how it's done.

322
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,750
We got this by the balls!

323
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,000
Uh, who is this person?

324
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,916
If ya ask me, she's a
red-headed pain in the butt.

325
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,416
Aw, she's just jealous of me!
Rule one, eat when ya can,

326
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,041
'cuz it might be your
last chance for a while.

327
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,666
If you say so.

328
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,125

[ALL gasp]

331
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
[RINKA]
Whoa, are you okay?

332
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,208
Yeah. I'm fine, really.

333
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,833
I gotta feeling mealtimes
are gonna be

334
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,458
tough for you if you don't learn
how to suppress your powers.

335
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,583
They're always in effect, unless
we consciously stifle them.

336
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,333
Trust me, we've all been there.

337
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,708
[MURASAKI]
Okay.

338
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,500
That was a rookie move, kid.

339
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,000
There's no way you're gonna
last a week out on your own.

340
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,375
Well, she's not on her own!

341
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,750
She's with us now,
so she's gonna be fine!

342
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,875
Man, you're a softie.

343
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,916
[RINKA, MURASAKI]
Huh?

344
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,541
Your grizzled prince
of a father did

345
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,375
such an amazing job
of raising you,

346
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:17,166
you don't know how tough the
real world can be out there!

347
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,166
I've been meaning to
ask ya somethin', Red.

348
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,041
What do your parents
do for a living?

349
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,750
Who knows, I never met 'em.

350
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:26,791
My grandma tried to
raise me, but, y'know.

351
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:30,916
I actually never got the chance
to meet my mom, either.

352
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,791
She died when I was a baby.

353
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,666
Right after I was born.

354
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,541
Yeah, alright,
so maybe life shorted ya

355
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,625
on that count.

356
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,250
But you gotta quit
the thievery crap.

357
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,791
You still got a chance, but ya
break the law enough times,

358
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:49,791
and there ain't gonna be no
happy ending to your story.

359
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,625
Help me.

360
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,916
I wanna be just
as strong as Rinka!

361
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,416
[RINKA]
Huh?

362
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,291
Teach me how to be like you!

363
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:01,083
I promise to give it my all,
no matter how hard it is!

364
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,875
I have this crazy power.

365
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,458
But right now,
it's just a burden.

366
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,000
I'll see what I can do.

367
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,500
[car honks]

368
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,166
[EDOYAMA]
I know I'm the last person

369
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,000
you wanna see right now,
but I brought over some things

370
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,333
that I thought you might
wanna have with you.

371
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,083
Y'know, just in case.

372
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:30,208
And this, most of all.
This was your mother's ring.

373
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,666
[EDOYAMA sighs]
I'm sorry.

374
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,791
I realize that things
in our house were never

375
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,625
like they should've
been for you.

376
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,333
I couldn't see how
to be a good boss

377
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:46,541
and a good dad, an' well,
you know which one I picked.

378
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,125
If you actually do
have the power

379
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,875
to see the history of an object,
that ring you're holding

380
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,166
is gonna tell you everything
you could ever wanna know

381
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,958
about how much your mother
really loved you.

382
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,041
[KUROI] Look at her.
Runs away from home,

383
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,791
and dear ol' dad
comes running after.

384
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,666
[EDOYAMA] I trust that you'll
take care of my little girl.

385
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,583
[RINKA]
Uh-- Sure.

386
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:08,666
[KUROI]
Hey.

387
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,791
Yeah, what's on your mind?

388
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,625
Stuff like this just
makes me wonder about

389
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,416
how things coulda
been different.

390
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,791
Like if I was your daughter,

391
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:19,541
would you've made
sure I was okay?

392
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,041
Course I woulda.

393
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,041
I'd be worried half to death.

394
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,208
Can't have my heart
walkin' around without me.

395
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,125
[gasps]

396
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,458
Are you okay?

397
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:33,541
[MURASAKI]
Yeah, this is like a miracle.

398
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,583
Huh?

399
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:39,416
[MURASAKI]
I just met my mom. No.

400
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,416
I just met my mom and my dad!

401
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,875
[RINKA] Our tiny tribe
came together by accident.

402
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:56,250
And, little by little, courage
bound our hearts as one.

403
00:23:56,333 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm sure most people
wouldn't envy the way we live,

404
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:05,333
but at this very moment, I
wouldn't trade it for the world.

405
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:08,250
It's miraculous. Yeah.

406
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,791
[PROFESSOR]
Psychometry, eh?

407
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:21,375
Fate has granted you quite
the interesting ability.

408
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:24,083
Who the hell are you?

409
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:28,958
[PROFESSOR] More often than not,
I am called the Professor.

410
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:32,333
Now, if you're finished,
I'd like to begin.
