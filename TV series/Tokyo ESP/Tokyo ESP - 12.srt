[YODANI] Ugh...!

[YODANI] That's the guy!

He's the one keeping
the building in the air!

00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,166
You must be unaware
that I'm the one

who's been training Minami and
the others for years now...

16

Do you really think bullets
are enough to stop me?

17
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:28,916
Pure absurdity!

remove him from you...?

[MINAMI] Other than
to remove his head?

Don't lie to me!

30
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,750
He was a part of your family.

00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,583
I know you couldn't
do that to him!

And what do you care, anyway?!

You're the one
who always dragged him

[MINAMI] You think you know
what we've been through?

40
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:15,125
You couldn't even imagine
the pain we've suffered.

41

[RINKA screams]

[MINAMI] This world is sick...
Humanity is a plague...

47
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,458
That must be eradicated.

48
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,833
[RINKA] You have to know
that's impossible.

49
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,875
Hating people
and holding grudges...

50
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:17,958
the need to fight...

51
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,291

falling in love.

You can't change that!

[RINKA]
Nothing will ever change.

If you succeed...
If you manage to create

this new world
you won't shut up about...

57
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,375
it'll be the exact same!

58
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,166
[RINKA] Kyotaro was
trying to help you!

59
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,708
He was trying to
save you from making

60
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,458
such a meaningless sacrifice!

If you cared about him,

00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,833
why was it so hard for you
to just believe him?!

64
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,083
If you had listened...

65
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,875
If you could have
only believed in him...

66
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,375
Everything could have
turned out so differently...

67
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,458
We could've learned
to live together.

68
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:05,166
If you're not gonna fight me,
you're just asking to die!

69
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,625
I won't let you have him...

00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,166
throughout the city!

163
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,208
He's gonna use transmission
waves to do it!

164
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,833
There's only
one place they can be.

165
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,875
[YODANI]
The Tokyo Sky Tree!

[KYOTARO gasps]

167
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,291
Whoa... What the hell's
wrong with the sky?

168
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,166
[YODANI] They've played
their winning hand.

169
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,791
The Professor's
greatest weakness

170
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,208
was his small number of espers.

171
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:06,875
But he's tipped the balance
in his favor now...

172
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,041
No matter how many
laws they pass,

173
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,041
the government will never
be able to control this.

174
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,375
We're witnessing the birth
of an entire race of espers...

175
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:19,583
and they'll descend upon Tokyo
like a plague of locusts.

176

--[MINAMI] Hm!
--[MURASAKI, RINKA, YODANI] Hm?

00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,958
[MINAMI] Then you
recognize that we've won...

178
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,916
It won't be long before the
espers take over this city.

179
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,333
You're done...

180
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,083
And there's nothing you
can do to protect anyone now.

181
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,083
[RINKA] Get back here!

182
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:38,208
[MURASAKI] Are you okay?

183
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,416
You feel up to lending me
your wings, Peggy?

[YODANI]
Don't do it, Rinka...

186
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:43,791
You haven't stopped fighting

187
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,791
since we got sprung
and you're injured...

188
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,916
You are well past your limit.

189
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,291
[RINKA]
I can still do it... I can!

190
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,666
[KUROI]
Just to be clear...

191
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,000
You do have
a better plan than

192
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,500
rushing in headfirst
and dying again, right?

193
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,500
What? How long've
you been around?

194
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,708
Don't change the subject...

195
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,291
You better not get offed.

196
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,666
Your dad's been through
enough already.

197
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,833
I know he has.

198
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,791
Is that why
you're tagging along?

199
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,958
Are you trying to protect me
to protect my dad?

200
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,375
Uh. Let's just say it's
cuz I'm a good person.

201
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,500
Or some bullshit.

202
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,916
Just do me one favor
in exchange, okay?

203
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,375
[KUROI] Tell your dad
how awesome I am.

to eat right before we work.

00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,916
[KOZUKI] Only reason
I was helping these freaks

224
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,666
was so I could steal
the ark first chance I got.

Never thought I be neck deep
in all this other crap.

You successfully
distracted the White Girl.

fully realized...

But it's only bound
to get more dangerous.

I think you two should leave.

any place for you to run.

of invisibility

remarkable fight, White Girl.

Not after I've come this far.

So close to finding Kyotaro.

really it? It can't be.

to stop fighting...

way past your limit...

I honestly didn't
realize that you still

297
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,875
cared for me so much.

298

But if you wanna know...

it all goes back to

[KYOTARO] It's not that
I felt... "abandoned."

305
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,791
I just felt powerless
not knowing where you were,

do anything for you.

But when Rinka came along,

310
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,625
she helped me find the strength
that I had deep down.

311
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,125
She barely knew me...

312
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,208
but that didn't stop her from
choosing to believe in me.

313

[KYOTARO]
That's all I needed.

314

And it was just as easy
for me to believe in her.

If things had been different...

[KYOTARO] If only I had
let myself believe in you.

Mm. But instead...

319
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,250

about protecting you.

Grab both Minami and

I've had a change of heart.

It's not the right time

You've finally
got your chance.

I sincerely doubt you'll
find a better opportunity

Same for you.
But you haven't yet.

Why the hell do you
always let me live?

[KYOTARO] Why did you
save me all those years ago?

343
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,625
Was it because you knew
that I would stop you someday?

[PROFESSOR] Of course not.

Kyotaro! You have to run!

And only seven days have passed
since they released the fish.

368

Crime has risen
to a staggering rate...

And virtually every offense
was perpetrated by an esper.

The only thing I know...

is we've gotta stay hidden
for the time being.

like to take a little break

on the line for this city
