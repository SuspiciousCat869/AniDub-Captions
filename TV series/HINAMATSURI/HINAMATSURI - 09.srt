1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,775
That? I lost it a long time ago.

00:00:14,858 --> 00:00:16,150
[IKARUGA]
Damn it.

3
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:18,608
I'll have to get a
replacement orb delivered.

4
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:22,567
I should probably try
calling Mao first.

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,150
She's shy, but she'll get
the job done, at least.

6
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,400
Boom.

7
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,150
[MAO]
Owwie!

8
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:43,608
[MAO groans]

9
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,692
Huh? Am I in... Japan?

10
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,983
[MAO]
Oh, no.

11
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:23,900
I'm in big trouble!

12
00:02:23,983 --> 00:02:26,942
How could I have
lost both of them?

13
00:02:27,025 --> 00:02:29,317
I've been looking
for them for ten days.

14
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,317
I can't find the orbs
or Miss Ikaruga!

15
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,900
This is bad.

16
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:41,192
[MAO] I failed my mission
before it even started!

17
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:44,025
What am I supposed to do now?

18
00:02:44,108 --> 00:02:46,317
[stomach growls]

19
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:03,275
I'm so lonely.

20
00:03:03,358 --> 00:03:06,858
I thought I would get a chance
to see Hina and Anzu here.

21
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,525
Why did I have to end up
in such a terrible situation?

22
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,233
[MAO]
I don't like being alone.

23
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:22,525
[thud]

24
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:29,108
[MAO]
Ah!

25

[MAO giggles]

26
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:36,150
[MAO]
It's Anzu and Hina!

27
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:39,025
But they're not
really doing anything.

28
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:40,358
Wait, I know!

29
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:46,358
Jeez, Mao! Get over it, already!

30
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:48,233
Things aren't that bad!

31
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:49,650
Feed me.

32
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:53,692
It's kinda the same.

33
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:58,067
I messed up my assignment.

34
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,067
And now I don't know what
my next move should be.

35
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,567
Don't blame yourself!

36
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,067
It's Miss Ikaruga's fault
for sending you to this place!

37
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,067
You're stuck on
a deserted island!

38
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,650
What does she expect?

39
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:09,567
Feed me.

40
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,067
Heh. That's true.

41
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,608
Yeah, she's always
bossing us around!

42
00:04:14,692 --> 00:04:17,067
Why don't we just hang out
here for a little while?

43
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,483
It'll be like, y'know,
a vacation or whatever!

44
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:21,692
A vacation?

45
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:23,358
Yeah, that sounds perfect!

46
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:24,525
Feed me.

47
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:26,942
Jeez, Hina! Is that
all you think about?

48
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:28,233
[giggles]

49
00:04:28,317 --> 00:04:29,817
[MAO]
I'm still smarter than you.

50
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,692
What?!

00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:33,733
[MAO laughs]

[MAO humming]

53
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:41,817
Check out my dress!

54
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,192
Do you like it?

55
00:04:43,275 --> 00:04:44,900
As long as you have
something to wear,

56
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:46,400
who cares what it looks like?

57
00:04:46,483 --> 00:04:47,733
Feed me.

58
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:50,858
You guys don't care about
fashion at all, do you?

59
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,567
Anyway, let's go!

60
00:04:58,233 --> 00:05:00,025
[MAO]
Where are you taking us, Mao?

61
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:02,942
We can't have a vacation
without a cottage, right?

62
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:09,233
[MAO]
Hey, that's not half bad!

63
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:10,858
Feed me.

64
00:05:10,942 --> 00:05:13,483
Don't you have more of that
jelly you're always eating?

65
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:14,525
I'm tired of it.

[MAO giggles]

67
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,275
Okay, I'll make lunch, then!

68
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:22,400
[MAO]
Eat up, Hina!

69
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:23,483
Nom.

70
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:26,650
No fair! Hina,
let me have some, too!

71
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:29,233
Don't worry, Anzu,
there's some for everyone!

72
00:05:29,317 --> 00:05:31,608
Uh, I didn't say that
'cause I want some.

73
00:05:31,692 --> 00:05:33,942
I'm just being polite
'cause you cooked it!

at this game, aren't you?

[MAO]
Is everything okay?

86
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:50,108
You seem kinda sad lately.

87
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:56,358
We call it a vacation, but it's
really just surviving, isn't it?

88
00:06:56,442 --> 00:06:57,608
What do you mean?

89
00:06:57,692 --> 00:06:59,983
It's a time to
relax and have fun!

00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:00,983
Right, Hina?

91
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:02,275
Feed me.

00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:03,525
Yeah, but...

00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:07,067
...I can't stay here by
myself forever, can I?

You have us.

You're not even close
to being Hina and Anzu!

You're just coconuts!

say he's the kind of guy

[NITTA]
Huh? Oh, yeah.

109
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:13,733
He used to be to me
what I am to you.

110
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:15,650
Last time he was
sent to the slammer,

111
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:19,567
it's 'cause he used a sword to
fight off four guys with guns.

112
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,567
You don't get a nickname
like Naito the Slayer

Ya dumbass!

116
00:08:25,442 --> 00:08:26,483
[NITTA]
I got it a long time ago

117
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:28,067
when he smacked me
with an ashtray

118
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,192
because I forgot to
light his cigarette.

119
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:33,567
He sounds like a
villain in a B-movie.

120
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,567
Do not get on his bad side.

121
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,650

Hey, Boss.

It's good to see you again.

It's been a long time, Nitta.

--Yeah.
--Uh, here!

Where's the president?

Take me there.

130
00:08:57,775 --> 00:09:00,358
Rumor is he's been in a coma.

the prez is retiring.

[NITTA]
Yeah.

133
00:09:06,608 --> 00:09:08,608
But then, as luck would
have it, the old dinosaur

134
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:11,108
went unconscious before he
could name a successor.

Yeah.

President! What's wrong?

137
00:09:15,317 --> 00:09:17,358
I told him he smelled
weird and he freaked out.

138
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:20,025
Don't say stuff like
that to old people!

139

come out of this coma,

I'll have a murderer
on my hands.

I'm next in line, of course,

but I can't move forward without
the support of the organization.

143
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,692
Heh. I know I've made you do
a little bit of dirty work

here and there in the past...

Yeah.

146
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,275
[NITTA]
You told me to kill a man.

147
00:09:40,358 --> 00:09:41,442
But you should know,

148
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:43,608
I did all those things
for your own good.

149
00:09:43,692 --> 00:09:46,233
What kind of president wouldn't
want one of his weaker guys

to grow a pair?

Okay, Lieutenant.

I'll get it for ya.

00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,567
So what's your take on it?

165
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,525
Do you want Lieutenant
Baba to be in charge?

166
00:10:22,608 --> 00:10:24,150
No.

167
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:26,442
You have to ask?

168
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,692
What makes you think I want
to give up this promotion

169
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:31,233
and let myself be cast to
the side, just like that?

170
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:33,983
I did time for these guys!

171
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,608
Nitta.

172
00:10:35,692 --> 00:10:38,858
I can count on you to
support me, can't I?

173
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:40,733
I mean, maybe.

174
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:42,067
It's hard to give
a straight answer

175
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,942
when you're holding
that ashtray.

176
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:47,442
Come on now, don't be afraid
of this little old thing!

177
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:50,025
Look, Boss. [grunts]

178
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,650
I understand how you
must feel and everything,

179
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:54,733
but maybe you can
let this one go?

180
00:10:54,817 --> 00:10:56,608
What? How dare you!

181
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:58,650
[BOTH grunt]

182
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,775
[NITTA] If the old man wakes
up to all this infighting,

183
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:03,483
I won't be able to show
my face here ever again.

184
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:06,567
I mean, this is the yakuza.
I might not have a face left!

185
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,983
That's enough--

186
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:08,983
[NITTA] Please, give your
support to the lieutenant,

187
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:11,400
so the president
can die in peace!

188
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:16,233
[NAITO laughs]
You know what, you're right.

189
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:17,733
[gasps]

190
00:11:17,817 --> 00:11:19,358
[NAITO] I've been acting like
a selfish kid about this,

191
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:20,317
haven't I?

192
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,650
Naito.

193
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:22,942
Good job!

194
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:26,567
You've become a real
stand-up mobster! [laughs]

195
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,067
Thanks a lot!

196
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,525
[NAITO]
You know, Nitta.

197
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:31,192
You're not that terrible!

198
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:34,900
[NITTA] What is it with these
guys and their non-compliments?

199
00:11:34,983 --> 00:11:36,900
[NAITO]
I just heard from Sabu.

200
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:40,525
He says the president
woke up from his coma.

201
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:43,567
[NITTA] Sir, you need
to pick a successor.

202
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,025
Yeah, never know which hospital
trip might be my last one.

203
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:50,567
It's better if I retire while
I'm young and limber, after all.

204
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,942
So, I assume the lieutenant
gets your spot, right?

205
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:54,483
[HINA]
Nitta.

206
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:56,858
What's a successor?
Does he get everybody's money?

207
00:11:56,942 --> 00:11:58,275
Be quiet!

208
00:11:58,358 --> 00:12:00,192
That's not quite it, little one.

209
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:02,483
This is a grown-up conversation!

210
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:04,817
[NITTA] He's acting like
she's his grandkid.

211
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,150
[HINA] I'm trying to make up
for saying you were stinky.

212
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:10,275
Don't worry, kid, I sprayed
myself down with Fasleeze!

213
00:12:10,358 --> 00:12:11,608
[NITTA]
Ugh.

214
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:14,650
A successor is a guy who's
gonna take over my job

215
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,275
so I can be a full-time peepaw.

216
00:12:17,358 --> 00:12:19,608
Ohh.

217
00:12:19,692 --> 00:12:21,942
I want Nitta to do it, then.

218
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:22,858
[BOSS]
Why's that?

219
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,567
Nitta's a dad and an old man,

220
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,025
so we should consolidate
him. It's confusing.

221
00:12:27,108 --> 00:12:28,400
What does that mean, exactly?

222
00:12:28,483 --> 00:12:30,900
Just a minute.

223
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,733
Let me think.

224
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:35,567
Just for you, Hina,
I'll let Nitta do it.

225
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,983
[NITTA]
Cut it out, gramps!

226
00:12:37,067 --> 00:12:40,150
You say that like
you're buyin' her candy!

227
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:43,567
[SABU]
No way. I gotta tell him!

228
00:12:46,817 --> 00:12:48,442
This ain't gonna work!

229
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:50,275
[OTHERS]
Huh?

230
00:12:50,358 --> 00:12:51,608
I've been begging
the whole group

231
00:12:51,692 --> 00:12:54,317
to support the lieutenant
becoming the president.

232
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,692
Ya can't let this
organization go to the dogs

233
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,358
just to make Hina happy!

234
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:00,775
Uh, you're right. Sorry, Nitta.

235
00:13:00,858 --> 00:13:03,775
Let's make Lieutenant Baba
the next president, okay?

236
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:05,942
[NITTA]
Glad you see it my way.

237
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:08,525
[SABU]
Oh, man.

238
00:13:08,608 --> 00:13:11,942
He's gonna kill me if I
say it was a false alarm!

239
00:13:13,317 --> 00:13:14,900
[SABU]
Maybe I'll say, "Oh, sorry,

240
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:16,317
I went to the
bathroom to text you

241
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,608
and didn't hear the end
of the conversation!"

242
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:20,608
That's still bad.

243
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:22,858
[NAITO]
Dammit! How did this happen?

244
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:25,608
Sabu says Nitta used his
daughter to get the old man

245
00:13:25,692 --> 00:13:27,692
to make a verbal promise.

246
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:30,067
The guy does treat that little
girl like his own grandkid,

247
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,567
so I shouldn't be surprised.

248
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,900
[NAITO] How can you
be so calm about this?

249
00:13:33,983 --> 00:13:35,692
That rat just cheated
the both of us

250
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:37,525
out of becoming the successor!

251
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,025
Forget what I said.

252
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:41,858
He is that terrible and I'm
gonna tear him a new one!

253
00:13:41,942 --> 00:13:43,067
[glass shatters]

254
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,108
[BABA]
Calling me calm?

255
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:48,650
I didn't realize you were
such a jokester, Naito.

256
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,192
Heh. Well, now.

257
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:53,567
You look meaner than you did
during that feud ten years back.

258
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,192
I am a yakuza.

259
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:57,608
Backstabbers have to
pay with their lives.

260
00:13:57,692 --> 00:13:59,775
That's my policy.

261
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,275
[NITTA groans]

262
00:14:03,358 --> 00:14:05,858
So you're finally awake.

263
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,525
[gasps] What the hell?

264
00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:12,692
I'm sure you know.

265
00:14:12,775 --> 00:14:15,900
Your little scheme just
blew up in your face, Nitta.

266
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:18,025
Nothin' like good
old-fashioned payback.

267
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,108
Time to swim with
the fishes, traitor.

268
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,525
[NITTA gasps]

269
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:23,858
Uh, please tell me you know
what this is all about!

270
00:14:23,942 --> 00:14:25,733
[SABU]
Um, nope.

00:14:25,817 --> 00:14:26,983
[gasps]

272
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,650
[NAITO]
Whoa, whoa, you better not speak

273
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:30,108
without raisin' your hand first.

274
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:32,567
[NITTA]
I'm encased in concrete!

275
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,150
[NAITO]
Go ahead, pal,

276
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:36,608
I'm sure you wanna give him a
piece of your mind, don't you?

277
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:38,108
Hi, Nitta.

278
00:14:38,192 --> 00:14:40,025
It was--I mean, um--

279
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,775
[NAITO] Huh? Disgusting!
Where's your pride?

280
00:14:43,858 --> 00:14:46,150
Can someone fill me in here?

281
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:48,400
[BABA] I thought
I could trust you, Nitta.

282
00:14:48,483 --> 00:14:49,858
I really did.

283
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:51,108
But no.

284
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:53,275
You had to use your rugrat
to con the old man

285
00:14:53,358 --> 00:14:55,442
into letting you be
the new president.

286
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:57,942
Huh? Wait, I can explain that!

287
00:14:58,025 --> 00:15:01,483
It's true, he did offer it to me
first because Hina won him over,

288
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,233
but I talked him
out of it, I swear it.

289
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:06,150
He said he wants you to
be the successor, not me!

290
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:09,233
But still, I've done such
a good job for the family.

291
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:10,650
It would've been nice
to be considered.

292
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:13,608
[NAITO sighs]
You're pathetic, Nitta.

293
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:16,650
You've been pullin' some
dirty tricks to get your way.

294
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:19,108
At least die with dignity.

295
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:22,692
This is it. I'm done for.

296
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:25,275
[BOSS]
Not so fast!

00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,108
[HENCHMEN gasp]

298
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,733
What's goin' on here?

299
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:30,650
[BABA] I'm sorry you
have to watch, but...

300
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:32,983
...Nitta needs to
learn a lesson!

301
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:35,192
And since his death will
leave the position open,

302
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:36,108
I'll be glad to step in--

303
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:38,358
Now wait just a minute!

304
00:15:38,442 --> 00:15:41,567
I only said that on a whim
and Nitta wouldn't have it!

305
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,858
Said to pick you!

306
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,692
[OTHERS]
Huh?

307
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:46,400
He's not lyin'?

308
00:15:46,483 --> 00:15:48,400
Sabu. Explain yourself.

309

Seriously, guys, I don't know!

310
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:53,192
I just heard that Nitta was
gonna maybe take the job,

311
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:55,692
so I left the room
immediately to tell you!

312
00:15:58,275 --> 00:15:59,900
Not again.

313
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:01,900
Well, in that case...

314
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:10,900
Uh, old man... is that
really what happened?

315
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:12,400

Of course it is!

316

Unlike some of ya,

317
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:17,650
Nitta has the organization's
best interest at heart!

318
00:16:21,858 --> 00:16:24,025
[BABA]
Guess we were wrong, Nitta.

319
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,067
Sorry about that.

320
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,858
Won't happen again.

321
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:30,233
[BABA]
Hey, I know!

322
00:16:30,317 --> 00:16:33,192
How's this? You can take
my spot after I move up!

323
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:35,608
Zenba, I know you're
second lieutenant and all,

324
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:36,942
but you don't mind, do ya?

325
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:37,817
Uh, well--

326
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,150
Perfect! Look at that, Nitta!

327
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,650
Your career's really
takin' off, huh?

328
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:46,067
All right! Let's all give a
cheer for our new lieutenant!

329
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,900
It's an historic day!

330
00:16:47,983 --> 00:16:48,900
[BABA]
Good idea!

331
00:16:48,983 --> 00:16:50,275
[NAITO]
Here we go!

332
00:16:50,358 --> 00:16:54,067
[BOTH]
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

333
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:59,483
[ALL] Lieutenant!
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

334
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:06,275
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

335
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,733
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

336
00:17:09,817 --> 00:17:13,192
Thanks. Now get me
the hell outta here.

337
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:16,567
[HITOMI]
A promotion is like an upgrade!

338
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,650
Like, when people
buy nice drinks?

339
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,775
Uh--yeah, maybe!

340
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:22,817
So he tastes better now?

341
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,067
Uh...

342
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,775
Hey, you should throw
him a promotion party!

343
00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:28,067
I bet that'd make
him super happy!

344
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,775
[UTAKO]
That's not a bad idea!

345
00:17:30,858 --> 00:17:34,025
Nitta's generous. He'd probably
give you something back, too!

346
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:36,150
You make me so sad.

347
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:38,733
I see. Both good points.

348
00:17:38,817 --> 00:17:40,817
[MATSUTANI]
No way, that's not Hina Nitta.

349
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,025
It's just a part-time worker

350
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:44,900
who happens to look
exactly like her. Yeah!

351
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:48,317
Okay, a martini, please!

352
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,108
I need help.

353
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:52,817
I don't know how
to throw a party.

354
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:57,692
[phone chimes]

355
00:17:57,775 --> 00:18:00,317
[VO] It depends on what you're
celebrating and who it's for.

356
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,483
We can't give you any advice

357
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:03,567
until you write that
in your question.

358
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,275
You could try asking
your acquaintances, too.

359
00:18:06,358 --> 00:18:07,817
Hope that helps!

360
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,858
Wow. Technology's great.

361
00:18:10,942 --> 00:18:13,233
[HITOMI]
Hmm. What about cake?

362
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:14,983
That's a birthday thing.

363
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:17,608
I'd print up a fancy portrait
of him and frame it!

364
00:18:17,692 --> 00:18:20,067
That'd be a weird party.

365
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,733
Then what's your idea, Aizawa?

366
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:23,983
Uh--let's see.

367
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:26,608
Maybe some nice flowers?

368
00:18:26,692 --> 00:18:30,150
[gasps] What, I don't
look like a flower person?

369
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:33,733
You can't celebrate
without drinking!

370
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:35,567
I say you get 'im some booze.

371
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,942
[HINA]
But you're always drinking.

372
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:38,983
'Cause I'm celebrating!

373
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:40,483
This life is a gift.

374
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:43,358
Every day I drink
a toast to being born.

375
00:18:43,442 --> 00:18:44,650
Well, if it was my party,

376
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:46,817
I would want some
of my favorite food!

377
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,150
Make it a surprise.

378
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:50,442
Think of something that'll
totally blow him away.

379
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:52,525
Huh. That sounds tricky.

380
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:54,983
I'm more confused
than when I started.

381
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,900
[ANZU] I see! That's why
you came to me for help!

382
00:18:57,983 --> 00:18:58,983
[HINA]
Nah, just food.

383
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:01,108
[ANZU]
Is that all you think about?!

384
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:05,567
I want to do something
really awesome, though.

385
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:10,108
Awesome. Awesome. Awesome...

386
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,983
I'll just do everything.

387
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,442
[NITTA]
I'm headin' out.

388
00:19:13,525 --> 00:19:15,858
[HINA] Call me on the
intercom when you get back.

389
00:19:15,942 --> 00:19:17,025
What for?

390
00:19:17,108 --> 00:19:18,067
So I'll be ready.

391
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,192
Nothing you say
ever makes sense.

392
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:21,317
Explain.

393
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,025
To celebrate your promotion.

394
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:25,650
[NITTA gasps]
Hey!

395
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:26,525
Check.

396
00:19:26,608 --> 00:19:28,067
[NITTA]
Should I be scared?

397
00:19:32,442 --> 00:19:33,608
[HINA]
Check.

398
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:36,525
Now I just need to get
a few things from town.

399
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,025
[HINA]
Check.

400
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,233
Check.

401
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:45,817
Yeah, I can't sell to a minor.

402
00:19:47,025 --> 00:19:48,733
Check. Heh.

403
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:53,608
[HINA]
I bought too many flowers.

404
00:19:57,525 --> 00:19:58,567
[gasps]

405
00:20:00,358 --> 00:20:02,317
I have some bottles.

406
00:20:05,317 --> 00:20:07,317
[HINA]
I'm sure that's close enough.

407

[HINA humming]

408
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:13,525
Perfect.

409
00:20:15,108 --> 00:20:16,067
[HINA]
Check.

410
00:20:17,942 --> 00:20:20,233
[HINA]
What's Nitta's favorite food?

411
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:26,817
Everybody likes salmon roe.

412
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:32,650
I don't want to give
him too much, though.

413
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,192
There.

414
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,358
All done.

415
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:41,733
Never thought she'd do
somethin' special for me.

416
00:20:41,817 --> 00:20:43,692
Man, I owe her big time.

417
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:47,442
Especially after that.

418
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:48,942
Hope she likes melon.

419

[intercom rings]

420
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,900
[HINA]
Uh-huh.

421
00:20:52,983 --> 00:20:53,900
[NITTA]
I'm comin' up.

422
00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:55,650
[HINA]
Got it.

423
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:57,608
Can I come in?

424
00:20:57,692 --> 00:21:00,025
Can't wait to see
what you planned!

[clears throat]

426

Hey.

[NITTA gasps]

428
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:13,025
[NITTA] I just walked
into my own funeral!

429
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,608
What is all this crap?

430
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:19,900
That's the kind
of messed-up stuff

431
00:21:19,983 --> 00:21:22,692
the bullies did in grade school.

432
00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:26,108
What the--a candle in salt?

433
00:21:26,192 --> 00:21:28,858
Salmon roe prayer beads?

434
00:21:34,442 --> 00:21:36,525
[NITTA]
Is that the coffin?

[NITTA gasps]

436

More importantly, where's Hina?
