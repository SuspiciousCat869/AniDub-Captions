1
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:13,483
[SHIGE]
There, all done.

2
00:00:13,567 --> 00:00:15,692
[ANZU gasps]

3
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:16,942
[SHIGE]
If you practice,

4
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:18,983
you should be able
to do it yourself.

5
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:27,067
Wow! Thank you
so much, Shige!

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,817
[YASSAN] You act like you've
got a granddaughter, old man.

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,317
[SHIGE] I just did it
'cause I felt like it.

8
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:36,608
[ANZU]
Like this, and...

9
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:38,567
Ta-dah!

10
00:00:38,983 --> 00:00:39,775
[gasps]

11
00:00:39,858 --> 00:00:40,817
Oh no!

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,858
I lost track of the time!

13
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:45,817
I wasted a perfectly
good candle!

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,442
[sighs] Oh well.

15
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:50,275
[ANZU]
See, look!

16
00:00:50,358 --> 00:00:52,400
Awesome, huh?

17
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:55,775
Just watch, I'll teach
you how to do it too!

18
00:00:55,858 --> 00:00:58,192
But video games are more fun.

19
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:00,233
Fine, forget it, stupid.

20
00:01:00,317 --> 00:01:04,108
You're nothing but
a big, dumb stupidhead!

21
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:06,150
[HINA]
Hmm...

22
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,275
Only stupid people
call people stupid.

23
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,233
[ANZU] Some of us
can't afford video games.

24
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:19,108
I'm so broke.

25
00:01:19,192 --> 00:01:20,650
[ANZU]
Money.

26
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:24,275
Money. Money.

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,233
[ANZU sighs]

28
00:01:29,317 --> 00:01:31,858
Money.

29
00:01:33,692 --> 00:01:34,858
If I had some cash,

30
00:01:34,942 --> 00:01:37,275
I could buy some games.

31
00:01:37,817 --> 00:01:40,358
[ANZU]
What should I do?

32
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:41,733
I don't get it.

33
00:01:41,817 --> 00:01:43,358
I used to be content
with the money I made

34
00:01:43,442 --> 00:01:45,650
from walking
around town all day.

35
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:49,400
But now that I have time,
I want to do stuff.

36
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:51,025
Or maybe work more.

37
00:01:51,108 --> 00:01:53,900
I dunno.
It's like I'm not satisfied

38
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:56,108
no matter what I'm doing.

39
00:01:56,192 --> 00:02:00,108
I never knew human
happiness was so unattainable.

40
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:36,733
Feast your eyes on this, Hina!

41
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:37,858
What is it, though?

42
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:39,817
Yassan gave me a hot tip!

43
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,233
There's a homeless guy
named Yoshida

44
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:43,525
who buys electronics
people throw out!

45
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:44,567
Oh.

46
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,650
Look, he'll pay
3,000 yen for a TV!

47
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:49,067
[HINA]
Cool.

48
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,358
[ANZU]
C'mon, let's go look for one!

49
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:54,483
[HINA]
Where can we get TVs?

50
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,233
[ANZU]
I'm thinking somewhere deserted.

51
00:03:57,317 --> 00:03:58,233
Hmm...

52
00:03:58,317 --> 00:04:00,317
I know I've seen
a place like that.

53
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,358
People are so wasteful.

54
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:04,900
What about right there?

55
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:09,108
Holy crap, Hina!
We found the motherlode.

56
00:04:09,192 --> 00:04:11,233
That was almost too easy!

57
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,775
It's like a giant
mountain of treasure!

58
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:15,983
You stand guard, Hina.

59
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:17,650
I'll be right back!

60
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:19,983
[HINA]
I'm tired.

61
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:20,650
[ANZU]
Hold on.

62
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:22,025
We're almost there!

63
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:24,108
[HINA]
Fine.

64
00:04:24,192 --> 00:04:26,400
Your butt's making it heavier!

65
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:28,858
Yoshida!

66
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:31,025
[YOSHIDA]
Hmm? Hey, kid.

67
00:04:31,108 --> 00:04:33,983
I guess word travels
fast around here.

68
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,150
[HINA]
You're pretty fancy for a hobo.

69
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:37,150
A hobo?

70
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:37,858
That's not nice.

71
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:39,150
[crash]

72
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:40,233
[ANZU shrieks]

73
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:42,400
No, my treasures!

74
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:45,025
[sobs]

75
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:47,608
You know those
are garbage, right?

76
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:48,817
You brought them for me?

77
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,192
I can't believe
you even bothered.

78
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:51,858
[ANZU]
But you wanted TVs!

79
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:54,567
Those old tube relics
are worthless nowadays.

80
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,275
I just buy 'em so I can
resell to Southeast Asia.

81
00:04:57,358 --> 00:04:58,650
[ANZU]
So, how much?

82
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,150
[YOSHIDA]
Ten yen.

83
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:02,650
That's all?

84
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:05,067
[YOSHIDA] Three thousand
yen is only for HDTVs.

85
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,858
Those aren't nearly as
easy to come by as these.

86
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,525
But what does a hobo
want with a bunch of TVs?

87
00:05:11,608 --> 00:05:13,317
[YOSHIDA]
You picking a fight with me?

88
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,067
[ANZU]
That's it.

89
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,400
[growls]

90
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,358
I'm all fired up.

91
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:22,108
I'll find you an HDTV,
no matter what!

92
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:23,442
Still no luck.

93
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:25,608
Wish we had more help.

94
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:26,900
I'm exhausted.

95
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:28,608
What? But I--

96
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:34,150
Hina?

97
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,442
I just called in
some reinforcements.

98
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:38,067
Huh?

99
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,025
Yeah, maybe I'd better ask
for help from my friend Hitomi.

100
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,775
Because she's
my friend and stuff.

101
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:48,317
Actually, I can't contact her,
even though she is my friend.

102
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,733
[HITOMI]
Hina?

103
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:51,525
Hitomi!

104
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:53,567
Oh. Anzu. Hey.

105
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,775
I'm confused.

106
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:56,525
The two of you know each other?

107
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:57,858
Yeah, we do.

108
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:00,358
Hina and I are classmates!

109
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:02,900
Oh. Right. I get it.

110
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:05,567
So, she was
your friend first, huh?

111
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,733
[sighs]

112
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:13,483
Hey, Anzu,
it's starting to get dark out.

113
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,608
Don't you think we
should call it a day soon?

114
00:06:15,692 --> 00:06:17,317
[ANZU]
We can't.

115
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,608
We still haven't found
the right kind of TV,

116
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:21,775
even after you agreed
to help us look.

117
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:27,108
[HITOMI] Don't worry, Anzu,
we can look for a little longer.

118
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:28,358
I'll check for some over here.

119
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:30,025
[ANZU]
Great!

120
00:06:33,483 --> 00:06:34,900
[HITOMI]
Hey, Mom, it's Hitomi.

121
00:06:34,983 --> 00:06:37,858
Look, about that new TV
we just brought home.

122
00:06:37,942 --> 00:06:39,817
I think I figured out
something useful we can do

123
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,483
with the old one.

124
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:50,858
Wow, Mom.

125
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:54,108
You didn't have to pack it up
in a box like I just bought it.

126
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:57,233
[HITOMI]
How about here?

127
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:01,150
Anzu's gonna be so happy!

128
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:01,775
[OFFICER]
Little girl!

129
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:03,150
[shrieks]

130
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:04,108
Uh...

131
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:06,025
What are you doing?

132
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:08,442
[HINA]
Hey. Can we be done now?

133
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:11,025
[ANZU]
We haven't found anything!

134
00:07:12,775 --> 00:07:14,858
I wonder where Hitomi is.

135
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:16,608
She must be working hard.

136
00:07:16,692 --> 00:07:20,775
[OFFICER] You can't leave large
items like that on the street.

137
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,317
You sure are quiet.

138
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,192
Nothing to say for yourself?

139
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:25,733
[HITOMI] If I told him
what I was up to,

140
00:07:25,817 --> 00:07:27,942
he probably wouldn't believe me.

141
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:31,400
And if he did, that might
create even more of a problem!

142
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:32,900
[OFFICER]
Oh well.

143
00:07:32,983 --> 00:07:34,817
Wait there while
I give your parents a call.

144
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,025
[HITOMI] Oh!
Please, sir, anything but that.

145
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:39,275
I'm sorry! No!

146
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,775
I'm too young to die.

147
00:07:40,858 --> 00:07:42,525
[OFFICER]
Sorry to scare you, sweetie.

148
00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:45,483
I've known the whole time.

149
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:48,442
It's okay, you can tell me.

150
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:49,608
Your mom and dad forced you

151
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:51,983
to dump that TV outside,
didn't they?

152
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:55,108
[HITOMI] I didn't expect
him to be that wrong.

153
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:56,650
[ANZU]
This is going nowhere!

154
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:59,900
Let's split off like Hitomi did,
so we can cover more ground!

155
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,108
[HINA]
There's a bunch.

156
00:08:05,775 --> 00:08:06,942
[NITTA]
A TV?

157
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:08,150
[HINA]
Yeah.

158
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:09,608
But we already have
one in the living room.

159
00:08:09,692 --> 00:08:11,067
[HINA]
It's not the same.

160
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:14,025
[NITTA]
Hmm...

161
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:17,358
That should be enough
to buy one, right?

162
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:18,400
Shouldn't you think

163
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:19,817
before you hand her
a wad of cash?

164
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,858
[NITTA]
Big deal.

165
00:08:20,942 --> 00:08:21,942
I'm enjoying my drink.

166
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:24,192
I'd rather avoid
a family discussion.

167
00:08:24,275 --> 00:08:25,067
[gasps]

168
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,817
Buy it from Bikkuri Camera!

169
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,608
For your perks card?

170
00:08:31,983 --> 00:08:32,983
[CABBY]
Where to, miss?

171
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:33,942
[HINA]
The river.

172
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:35,400
[CABBY]
Seems legit.

173
00:08:36,775 --> 00:08:38,233
[HINA]
Here you go, hobo.

174
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,692
[YOSHIDA]
Hold up.

175
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:42,442
This TV's factory-sealed.

176
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:45,067
Why would she sell this?

177
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,192
Maybe it's some kinda trick?

178
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:50,400
Huh, I can't get
a read on this twerp.

179
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:52,317
[CABBY]
Wait, miss!

180
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,067
You still have to pay
5,920 yen for the taxi fare!

181
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,067
But I'm out of money.

182
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,108
Huh?

183
00:08:58,192 --> 00:09:00,317
Uh. That's all right.
I'll pay it.

184
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,150
As a handling fee for the TV.

185
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,400
Makes no difference to
me, I guess.

186
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:08,317
But you should know, she just
bought that at Bikkuri Camera.

187
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,900
What's she trying to pull?

188
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,650
[YOSHIDA]
Don't look at me, pal.

189
00:09:14,317 --> 00:09:16,025
[ANZU]
Hina!

190
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,108
[sighs]
I still couldn't get any TVs.

191
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,733
Yeah, they're so hard to find.

192
00:09:21,817 --> 00:09:23,275
I know.

193
00:09:23,358 --> 00:09:24,650
Let's give up.

194
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:27,608
Huh? Huh?!

195
00:09:29,483 --> 00:09:30,650
Am I seeing things?

196
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:33,067
It wasn't easy, but I succeeded.

197
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,817
I tried to plant it, but...

198
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,608
[ANZU]
You're the best!

199
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:39,650
What's wrong,
you don't seem very happy.

200
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:41,567
That's silly, of course I am.

201
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,233
Heh heh. See, I'm dying of joy.

202
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,650
[ANZU]
Wow, that's amazing,

203
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:48,108
you saved the day and
didn't let it go to your head!

204
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,733
[HITOMI]
Sure, that's it.

205
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:52,067
[YOSHIDA]
Another one in a box?

206
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,483
There's no way it's trash.

207
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:58,025
I know it goes against my best
interest to say this, but...

208
00:09:58,108 --> 00:10:00,567
Just sell these at a pawn shop!

209
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:05,775
[ANZU] I didn't think we would
make anything at all today!

210
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:08,900
Are you sure you don't mind me
cashing in on the one you found?

211
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,608
Oh no, don't
worry about it, Anzu.

212
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:12,150
If you hadn't told
me you needed a TV,

213
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:15,150
I'm sure it would have just
ended up going to waste anyway.

214
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:16,817
The three of us should split it.

215
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,192
How's that sound?

216
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:20,275
Yeah, okay.

217
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:23,317
So, why did you try so hard
to get rich all of a sudden?

218
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,817
Uh...

219
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,233
Um, because...

220
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:28,525
Huh?

221
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:30,233
Well, I noticed you
liked video games,

222
00:10:30,317 --> 00:10:33,400
so I wanted to
get one and play it with you.

223
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:34,650
I'm not telling!

224
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:36,358
[HITOMI]
You just did.

225
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,067
[HINA]
I'm home.

226
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,900
Hey. Did you pick out a TV?

227
00:10:39,983 --> 00:10:40,483
[HINA]
Yeah.

228
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:41,608
Good for you.

229
00:10:41,692 --> 00:10:43,650
I guess it'll be here
in a few days?

230
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:45,192
No, actually, I sold it.

231
00:10:45,275 --> 00:10:46,858
You did what?

232
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:47,900
Where's the cash?

233
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:49,733
Not that that's
the main issue here.

234
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,608
I had to pay for a taxi.

235
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,067
Okay...? Start over.

236
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:57,858
[TAKASHI]
Kengo, wait!

237
00:10:57,942 --> 00:11:00,150
[KENGO] We gotta get home,
or we're in big trouble!

238
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:03,233
Hey, that's Mishima!

239
00:11:03,317 --> 00:11:04,733
Huh?

240
00:11:04,817 --> 00:11:06,442
Yeah, you're right!

241
00:11:10,108 --> 00:11:11,317
[KENGO]
Huh?

242
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:16,317
[KENGO]
Isn't this a bar?

243
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,483
Why did she go in?

244
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:21,733
Huh? Look! It's Matsutani!

245
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,567
That was close!

246
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:30,692
Did he just go inside too?

247
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:34,067
Why would a teacher
meet a student at a bar?

248
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,442
[BOTH] Oh!
I bet they're doing dirty stuff!

249
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:38,400
[MATSUTANI]
Come closer!

250
00:11:38,483 --> 00:11:40,483
[HITOMI]
So forbidden.

251
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,442
No!

252
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:42,900
[KENGO]
Wait, what happens next?

253
00:11:42,983 --> 00:11:43,900
[TAKASHI]
Boob touch, duh!

254
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:44,817
[KENGO]
Then what?

255
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,608
I'm just a kid, Takashi.

256
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:48,150
I don't know how it works!

257
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:49,025
No fair!

258
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,608
I wanna grow up now!
Waaaah!

259
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:54,192
[KENGO] Does this mean
our teacher's a pedo?

260
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:56,692
[TAKASHI]
We should kick his butt!

261
00:11:57,733 --> 00:11:59,067
[TAKASHI]
Friends!

262
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,775
Thank you all for joining
us to address this crisis!

263
00:12:02,858 --> 00:12:05,358
Uh, I'm the only one here.

264
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:07,858
Well, we couldn't
have word getting out.

265
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:10,650
Mishima's reputation
is at stake.

266
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:12,442
[SAYO] Hitomi wouldn't
do something like that!

267
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:14,650
Take it back, right now!

268
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:18,400
Yeah, listen, Inspector Aizawa.

269
00:12:18,483 --> 00:12:20,817
The top brass never sees
what it's like on the ground.

270
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,108
[KENGO]
Mm-hmm.

271
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:23,983
If you want to play
detective, go bother Hina.

272
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:25,192
Uh, but she's so--

273
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:26,942
I know she's useless.

274
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:28,233
But if nothing else,

275
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:29,775
she can be the team mascot
or something, right?

276
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:31,483
[TAKASHI]
It's not a game!

277
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:32,525
All right, fine.

278
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:34,608
Sergeant Kengo,
get me Officer Hina.

279
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:36,192
Roger that, Captain Takashi!

280
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:38,442
[SAYO]
How old are you guys again?

281
00:12:41,317 --> 00:12:42,692
[KENGO]
I brought in Officer Hina, sir!

282
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:44,317
So what's going on?

283
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,108
[TAKASHI]
Listen, rookie.

284
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:47,900
Just try not to get in the way.

285
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:50,233
Hey, you recruited her!

286
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:52,525
[TAKASHI]
Let's go over the plan.

287
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:53,567
Uh...

288
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,275
I'm going to
supervise this endeavor.

289
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,692
The Inspector?

290
00:12:57,775 --> 00:13:00,317
I am Hitomi's friend, after all.

291
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
So unlike you clowns,

292
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:04,983
I won't stop
until I clear her name!

293
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:06,275
[TAKASHI]
That's our Inspector!

294
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:07,317
[KENGO]
You're so cool!

295
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,483
[HINA]
Um. I'm lost.

296
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:11,400
[SAYO]
I have my doubts.

297
00:13:11,483 --> 00:13:14,025
But if there's even a chance.

298
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:16,108
So, Hitomi,

299
00:13:16,192 --> 00:13:17,233
I saw you walk through

300
00:13:17,317 --> 00:13:18,525
the entertainment
district last night.

301
00:13:18,608 --> 00:13:19,525
[HITOMI gasps]

302
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:20,192
[SAYO]
Hmm?

303
00:13:20,275 --> 00:13:21,858
[HITOMI]
No! I was.

304
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:23,442
Uh...

305
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:28,900
Oh! I... I was at prep school!

306
00:13:28,983 --> 00:13:30,525
[SAYO]
At Kaishinjuku?

307
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:31,775
That's in the area.

308
00:13:31,858 --> 00:13:33,317
[HITOMI]
Yeah, exactly.

309
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,775
[SAYO] There's a popular
teacher there named Yoshida.

310
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:36,650
Do you have him?

311
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,942
Um. Oh, no.

312
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:42,192
I'm not in Mr. Yoshida's class,
but I've heard good things!

313
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:43,692
[SAYO]
Oops, I meant Yoshino.

314
00:13:43,775 --> 00:13:47,775
Golly gee! Him, yeah!

315
00:13:47,858 --> 00:13:49,567
[SAYO]
Be right back.

316
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:53,900
[laughs] What kind of nerd
says "golly gee" and means it?

317
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:55,358
Ooh.

318
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:58,108
I wonder what other stupid
things I can get her to say.

319
00:13:58,192 --> 00:13:59,233
No!

320
00:13:59,317 --> 00:14:01,692
Sayo Aizawa never
forgets her mission!

321
00:14:02,483 --> 00:14:05,317
[SAYO]
Sorry about that.

322
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,275
By the way,
those teachers don't exist.

323
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:08,733
[HITOMI]
Huh?

324
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:09,733
Of course!

325
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:11,358
Yeah, I knew
that the whole time.

326
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:13,983
I just didn't have the
heart to correct you, so...

327
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:15,567
Boy howdy, this is awkward.

328
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,692
I'm in quite a pickle here!

329
00:14:16,775 --> 00:14:18,150
[SAYO]
I didn't think so at first,

330
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,858
but she is hiding something.

331
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:24,108
I guess she must be
in some kind of trouble.

332
00:14:24,192 --> 00:14:26,025
Hey, Hitomi.

333
00:14:26,108 --> 00:14:28,650
Have you been
to the Little Song?

334
00:14:29,317 --> 00:14:31,483
[STUDENT] Gross,
Mishima's puking everywhere!

335
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:33,650
You got your
milk all over my face!

336
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:35,567
[TAKASHI]
Well she certainly overreacted.

337
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,858
So, have you, or not?

338
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,150
No way!

339
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,817
[SAYO]
Yeah, she has.

340
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,817
She's so cute
when she's terrified.

341
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,400
So, that Central Park band
you like has a new song.

342
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:52,692
Uh, Yeah, it's so good!

343
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,317
Oh wait, that was a lie too.

344
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,025
Stop it!

345
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:58,983
After intense interrogation,
the suspect never spilled.

346
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:01,775
Give it a rest, Aizawa.
you weren't even trying!

347
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:04,192
Yeah, all you did
was mess with her!

348
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:05,400
Well, Inspector?

349
00:15:05,483 --> 00:15:06,858
[KENGO]
Say something, would ya?

350
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:09,900
Huh?

351
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:12,275
When she panics like that,
she's just too cute for words!

352
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:13,692
[KENGO]
Ugh, will you be serious?

353
00:15:13,775 --> 00:15:16,733
Fine, we don't need you!
We'll crack the case on our own!

354
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:19,317
Oh yeah?
I'll believe that when I see it!

355
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:25,775
[TAKASHI] It's lame
if we leave the same way.

356
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,150
[SAYO]
There's only one staircase,

357
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:29,775
what do you want me to do?

358
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:31,442
I'm confused.

359
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:32,733
This sucks, Captain.

360
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:33,608
What now?

361
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:35,400
We keep looking for evidence.

362
00:15:35,483 --> 00:15:36,650
If they're doing stuff,

363
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:38,942
we might catch 'em
alone together at school.

364
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:40,525
[gasps]

365
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:42,442
[KENGO]
At school?

366
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,275
You think they
would really, you know?

367
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:45,400
[TAKASHI]
Cut it out, Kengo.

368
00:15:45,483 --> 00:15:46,983
Don't make me think about it!

369
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,817
Mishima.

370
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,150
Could you come with me
to the prep room please?

371
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:53,525
[HITOMI]
Sure.

372
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:56,608
[TAKASHI, KENGO gasp]
This guy doesn't waste time!

373
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:03,692
[HITOMI]
I'm coming in.

374
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:09,483
[KENGO]
The prep room.

375
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:12,150
[TAKASHI]
They're right behind that door.

376
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:14,275
What could they
be doing in there?

377
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:15,567
[HITOMI]
Oh no.

378
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,817
We shouldn't.

379
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,900
[TAKASHI] I still don't
know what comes next!

380
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:20,442
[KENGO]
Screw it, let's just bust in!

381
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:21,525
You're right!

382
00:16:21,608 --> 00:16:22,400
Even if we happen
to see something,

383
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:24,192
it's for investigative purposes!

384
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,900
[KENGO]
True that!

385
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:28,608
[HITOMI screams]

386
00:16:28,692 --> 00:16:30,692
[MATSUTANI]
What are you kids doing?

387
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:34,067
Ah, great, now the printouts
are all mixed up.

388
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,317
All right, boys.

389
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,733
Give Mishima a hand here.

390
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:44,608
Uh. Hey, Mishima?

391
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:46,275
[HITOMI]
Yes, Takashi?

392
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:49,608
Are you doing anything
weird you can't tell us about?

393
00:16:51,817 --> 00:16:52,817
[HITOMI]
Huh?

394
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,025
That came out of nowhere.

395
00:16:55,108 --> 00:16:56,108
[TAKASHI, KENGO]
She's got "guilty" written

396
00:16:56,192 --> 00:16:57,775
all over her face!

397
00:16:57,858 --> 00:16:58,692
[KENGO]
You dummy!

398
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:00,358
What you're doing is wrong!

399
00:17:00,442 --> 00:17:02,067
You think it's bad?

400
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,025
I mean, I have
to keep it secret,

401
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:05,817
but it's really gratifying!

402
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,317
Gratifying?

403
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,608
Uh, well, it would
be if there was something!

404
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,400
Kengo!

405
00:17:15,483 --> 00:17:17,358
[HITOMI]
The printouts...?

406
00:17:17,442 --> 00:17:18,817
[TAKASHI]
Matsutani!

407
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:21,525
Mark my words.

408
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:22,942
We'll catch you one day!

409
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:26,358
And we'll finally know
what happens next!

410
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:28,358
All that aside,

411
00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:30,733
did they really have to
throw these on the floor?

412
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:34,525
Well? Is the case closed?

413
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,608
[KENGO] We want you back
on the squad, Aizawa.

414
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,108
[TAKASHI]
I just know the answer's

415
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:42,983
right around the next corner.

416
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:44,525
[KENGO]
And once we find it,

417
00:17:44,608 --> 00:17:48,775
we'll make sure that teacher
pays for his despicable crimes.

418
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:50,567
[SAYO] Do you
hear yourselves right now?

419
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,192
[KENGO]
Huh? Look, there she is!

420
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:57,817
She went in!

421
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,358
It is true!

422
00:17:59,442 --> 00:18:00,567
[TAKASHI]
And now, we wait.

423
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,858
Wait for what?

424
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:05,025
[KENGO]
Where's Matsutani?

425
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:06,692
[HINA]
Still confused.

426
00:18:06,775 --> 00:18:07,942
[TAKASHI]
Maybe we had it wrong.

427
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:09,650
[KENGO]
Hmm. Y'think so?

428
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:12,525
Yeah. What if she
does it with lots of guys.

429
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:14,483
You know, for money
or something?

430
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:18,817
Hitomi would never do that!

431
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,025
You can't ignore facts.

432
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:22,067
She even told us
it was gratifying!

433
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,358
Oh. Nitta.

434
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,942
By "Nitta," you mean your dad?

435
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:30,858
[HINA]
Mm-hmm.

436
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:32,525
Huh? He's not.

437
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:33,900
Is he?

438
00:18:33,983 --> 00:18:36,400
[TAKASHI, KENGO] He's
totally here to see Mishima!

439
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,025
Oh crap. No way!

440
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:40,608
Does this mean Mishima's
on a date with Hina's dad?

441
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:42,275
Gross!

442
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:43,483
How 'bout that?

443
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:45,317
I hope you're happy
with your future mommy!

444
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,317
Calm down, man,
this is a crime scene!

445
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,483
They're at a bar!

446
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:50,442
So, plenty of love
stories begin in a bar!

447
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:52,067
Don't be such an idiot!

448
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:56,900
If their love begins here, then
I'll make sure it ends here too!

449
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,192
[SAYO] C'mon, Hitomi,
please don't be doing

450
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:04,650
what I think you're doing.
Please!

451
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:05,442
[HITOMI]
Welco--

452
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:07,483
[gasps]

453
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:08,858
[BOTH gasp]

454
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:11,275
Uh....

455
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:18,858
[silent screaming]

456
00:19:18,942 --> 00:19:19,900
Inspector?

457
00:19:19,983 --> 00:19:22,150
Should we be
freaked out or relieved?

458
00:19:22,233 --> 00:19:24,358
I have no clue.

459
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:30,275
Well, whatever's happening,
it isn't what we thought.

460
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:32,692
Huh. Yeah. I guess not!

461
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:34,317
It could be a lot worse!

462
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,525
Not cool, Mishima.

463
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:36,775
You had us worried!

464
00:19:36,858 --> 00:19:39,108
Why are you bartending?

465
00:19:39,192 --> 00:19:41,733
[HITOMI]
Boys and girls.

466
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:44,733
Sorry, but children
aren't allowed in bars.

467
00:19:47,108 --> 00:19:49,275
Whoa. She's really
going to play dumb!

468
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:52,108
Do you seriously think you
can fool us with that trick?

469
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,358
Yeah! What's your deal?

470
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,442
The target's getting
belligerent, Inspector!

471
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:56,858
This takes finesse!

472
00:19:56,942 --> 00:19:58,067
Fess up or else!

473
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,233
[TAKASHI]
Tell us your address, miss.

474
00:20:00,317 --> 00:20:03,358
Uh. Please don't make
a scene at my workplace.

475
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:05,150
She gonna survive this?

476
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:07,400
Doesn't look that way, does it?

477
00:20:07,483 --> 00:20:09,483
[SAYO]
Hitomi.

478
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:11,442
Truth is, we did all this stuff

479
00:20:11,525 --> 00:20:15,108
because we were
concerned for you.

480
00:20:15,192 --> 00:20:18,192
It's fine if you
keep it to yourself.

481
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:22,733
The only thing I need to know,
is whether or not you're okay.

482
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:25,442
You scared me.

483
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:29,108
'Cause I care about you.

484
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:31,025
We're friends, right?

485
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:38,942
I'm sorry, Sayo.

486
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:41,025
I promise I'm all right.

487
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:42,608
[SAYO]
Oh? Is that so?

488
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:44,567
Huh?

489
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,900
How did you know my first name
was Sayo, Miss Bartender?

490
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:50,775
[shrieks]

491
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,067
The gig is up, Mishima.

492
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:00,692
Your mother's gonna
be so disappointed in you.

493
00:21:00,775 --> 00:21:03,192
Sorry. I should've
told you guys.

494
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:06,025
[SAYO] I want to hear
an official confession.

495
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:07,650
Say, "I'm a middle
school student

496
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:11,817
who secretly
works as a bartender."

497
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,067
I'm a middle school student

498
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,692
who secretly
works as a bartender.

499
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:17,983
Again!

500
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:19,233
Uh, I'm a middle school student

501
00:21:19,317 --> 00:21:20,817
who secretly works
as a bartender!

502
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,692
Come on, louder!

503
00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:24,150
Fine. I'm a middle
school student

504
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:26,525
who secretly works
as a bartender!

505
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:27,692
[SAYO]
I can't hear you!

506
00:21:27,775 --> 00:21:28,983
[HITOMI]
I'm a middle school student

507
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:31,400
who secretly works
as a bartender!

508
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:32,483
[SAYO]
Once more with feeling,

509
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:34,775
like a pop star
playing a concert!

510
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:36,192
[HITOMI]
I'm a middle school student

511
00:21:36,275 --> 00:21:40,608
who secretly works as
a bartender. Now, let's rock!

512
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,983
What is this?

513
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:51,983
I still don't know.

514
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:53,692
Someone tell me.

515
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:55,817
[MATSUTANI]
Huh?

516
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,983
You again?

517
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:58,400
What are you three
doing in a bar?

518
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:58,983
[KENGO]
Uh-oh!

519
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,942
Matsutani!

520
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:04,025
[MATSUTANI]
Oh, I get it!

521
00:22:04,108 --> 00:22:06,317
You mistook her
for Mishima, didn't you?

522
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,733
Nope, Hitomi just
looks exactly like her!

523
00:22:09,817 --> 00:22:13,025
[ALL 3] How does someone that
stupid get to become a teacher?

524
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,275
[HINA] Next time;
"Nitta- <i>san</i> Has a Dandy Dad."
