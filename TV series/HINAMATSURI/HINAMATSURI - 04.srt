00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:17,692
[NITTA]
So, Hina.

2
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:19,775
Now that you're over
your food poisoning,

3
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:23,942
would you mind explaining to me
how you made such a huge mess?

4
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:26,192
You do know "cleaning"
means getting rid of messes,

5
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:27,983
right, ya little creepazoid?

6
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:29,817
Huh? Huh?

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,483
Ya got anything to say?

8
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:33,233
[groans]

9
00:00:33,317 --> 00:00:35,567
And you broke my new vase.

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,317
I'm done with you!

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,900
Consider yourself disowned!

12
00:02:16,025 --> 00:02:17,692
[NITTA] And don't even think
about breaking more stuff

13
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:19,108
to threaten me.

14
00:02:19,192 --> 00:02:21,275
I'm not scared of you.

15
00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:26,275
Bye, squirt.

16
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:28,192
Have a nice life, I guess.

17
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:34,650
Nitta. I'm sorr--

18
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:36,108
[NITTA]
Beat it.

19
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:48,650
I wonder what I should do now.

20
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:51,983
[HINA]
He gave me money for the road.

21
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:53,442
I should get some food.

22
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:59,358
Yay. Yay.

23
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:01,192
I'm out of money.

24
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:03,733
Now I'm really in trouble.

25
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,108
I guess I'll play a game.

26
00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:06,900
[ANZU]
Hina?

27
00:03:06,983 --> 00:03:07,775
Is that you?

28
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:11,775
[HINA]
Hm? Hey, Anzu.

29
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,150
I thought you went home already.

30
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:16,067
[ANZU]
Eh, long story.

31
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,358
It looks like I'm not the only
one who screwed up my life.

32
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:21,108
Tell him you're sorry!

33
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:24,025
[HINA] I tried that,
but he didn't forgive me.

34
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:25,692
Hey, this isn't enough food.

35
00:03:25,775 --> 00:03:26,650
Got more?

36
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:27,775
[sighs]

37
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:29,400
You do have a
plan though, right?

38
00:03:29,483 --> 00:03:31,233
[HINA] Yeah, getting
more food from you.

39
00:03:31,317 --> 00:03:32,900
That was all!

40
00:03:32,983 --> 00:03:34,817
[gasps]

41
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,483
I wish I could go back
to live with Nitta.

42
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:42,400
Well, I'll let you
stay with me for now.

43
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:44,942
Just figure things
out soon, okay?

44
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,192
You're loud.

45
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:56,900
Gah!

46
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:58,108
Owwie.

47
00:03:58,192 --> 00:04:00,817
Right in the jugular.

48
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:17,525
Wake up, Hina.

49
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:18,942
It's morning.

50
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:19,900
[sighs]

51
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:21,900
I guess you don't have to.

52
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Brought you
today's magazines, mister.

53
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:31,067
Oh. That's great, Anzu.

54
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,275
Thanks!

55
00:04:32,358 --> 00:04:33,525
Here's your payment.

56
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,275
[ANZU]
Thank you!

57
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,067
[SHOP OWNER] You off
to collect some cans now?

58
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,942
Yeah.

59
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:39,400
See ya!

60
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:42,358
[ANZU]
Hina.

61
00:04:42,442 --> 00:04:42,983
Hey.

62
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:44,733
Are you awake yet?

63
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:47,275
Who said you could eat that?

64
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:48,442
So?

65
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:49,858
Have you been thinking
of a plan at all?

66
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:54,067
[HINA] Yeah, but it is
a pretty complicated problem.

67
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,275
My game system's dead.

68
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:56,483
[groans]

69
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:58,650
No, not that!

70
00:04:58,733 --> 00:04:59,900
[NITTA]
Ah.

71
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:01,650
Now that Hina's gone,
back to day-drinking.

72
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:03,150
[door bell]

73
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:04,358
What?

74
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:05,108
Dammit, Hina.

75
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:06,317
Go.

76
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,900
No more sob-stories.

77
00:05:09,983 --> 00:05:10,858
Yes?

78
00:05:10,942 --> 00:05:12,317
Uh. Hello!

79
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,067
I'm Mishima
from Watanabe Middle.

80
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,608
[NITTA]
Oh right, you're the bartender.

81
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,567
Nope, just Hina's classmate!

82
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,358
Anyway, I brought her
some handouts from school.

83
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:23,192
[NITTA]
Oh, thanks, that's nice.

84
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:25,733
Uh. Could you leave
'em in the mailbox?

85
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:29,983
Sure, but where's Hina?
Has she not been feeling well?

86
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:33,900
Uh, it's kind
of a personal issue.

87
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:35,942
She's with my family for now.

88
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:37,692
[HITOMI]
Oh, I see.

89
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:40,275
Yup. Take care, then.

90
00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:41,858
Forgot about school.

91
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,900
[HITOMI]
That's odd.

92
00:05:45,983 --> 00:05:48,192
I wonder why she
has to miss school?

93
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:51,067
I never know how to ask
about things like that.

94
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,650
[UTAKO]
Hitomi!

95
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:53,692
Thank goodness!

00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:55,233
[HITOMI]

We need extra hands!

Come help us out!

99
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,817
[HITOMI]
With what?

100
00:06:03,317 --> 00:06:04,775
Say, can you give me some extra?

101
00:06:04,858 --> 00:06:07,275
Sorry, but there's a long line.

102
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:09,775
We have to be fair.

103
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:11,233
Okay, who's next?

104
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:12,275
[gasps]

105
00:06:12,358 --> 00:06:13,067
Food, please.

106
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,317
[UTAKO]
What? Hina?

107
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,483
Oh, hey. It's you.

108
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:16,900
[UTAKO]
What are you doing here?

109
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:18,233
I'm hungry.

110
00:06:18,317 --> 00:06:19,817
[ANZU]
Come on, I'm starving!

111
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,525
Oh. Sorry. Here.

112
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:26,483
[ANZU]
Okay, Hina, let's go.

113
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:29,317
[UTAKO]
Wait a second!

114
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:31,192
Hitomi, was it?

115
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:32,108
Thanks for your help.

116
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,483
[HITOMI]
Yeah, sure thing!

117
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,275
[UTAKO]
Hitomi!

118
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:38,275
Any idea what's been
going on with Hina?

119
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,317
Disowned her?

120
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,483
Uh-huh.

121
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:45,525
Why would you do that, Boss?

122
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:48,650
[NITTA] You don't know
how crazy it's been with her.

123
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:50,775
That brat costs me so
much money and headache,

124
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:51,983
and what do I get in return?

125
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:54,233
Nothing, zilch, nada!

126
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:56,233
Huh?

127
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:01,025
Raising kids isn't
about what you get back.

128
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:02,275
Yeah, and you're
the one who told her

129
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:03,942
she could move in with you.

130
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:08,025
[NITTA growls]
I know that, but still,

131
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:10,400
I'm not the kid's
father or anything!

132
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:12,275
Who cares?

133
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:15,525
You suck.

134
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:16,608
[groans]

135
00:07:16,692 --> 00:07:17,817
[NITTA]
This'd be easier

136
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,650
if I could tell them
she fell out of the sky.

137
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:21,775
[BAR GOER A]
Jeez, man!

138
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:22,733
What's wrong with you?

139
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,983
Don't talk like that!

140
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:25,775
You're a bad parent!

141
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:27,775
[NITTA]
Aren't they just extras?

142
00:07:27,858 --> 00:07:29,858
That was way too harsh, sir.

143
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:32,942
I can't even look
at you right now.

144
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:43,650

Does he have a name, or...?

Go away! Go away! Go away!

Go away! Go away! Go away!
Go away! Go away! Go away!

[NITTA cries]

148
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:01,858
Hurry! Get the salt!

149
00:08:01,942 --> 00:08:03,317

Yeah?

[UTAKO] You'll have
to pay for Nitta's drink.

[SABU]
Aw, man.

155
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:12,067
[NITTA sighs]

156
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,358
I don't give a damn
if Hina's having a hard time

157
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:16,442
out there by herself!

158
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:18,942
Besides,

159
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:21,483
Anzu makes it work somehow.

160
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,983
She'll be all right, too.

161
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:31,108
I'm sitting in the one-seater,
just like when she was here.

162
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:33,775
I've picked up
some weird habits.

[ANZU]
Hina.

164
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:42,317
Candles cost money, you know.

165
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,650
[HINA]
Just a few more minutes.

166
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,400
[ANZU] And we could sell

That's it, I've had enough!

and laze around all day!

I can't deal with you!

I wonder what I should do.

I sure miss living with Nitta.

How can I get him
to let me come back?

He got mad, because of the vase.

She was in line to get soup,

195
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:28,275
so she probably ended up going
to Anzu's place or something.

196

It's not like I'm worried
about Hina's safety,

Um. Well, I... I'm out walking!

you're lurking outside of a park
like some kind of a weirdo.

all over my back lately.

hard work you put in.

There we go.

Working all-nighters
is really exhausting,

on the weekends!

are starting to suspect

327
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:32,733
I'm not staying
at a friend's house.

328
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:35,400
I should have a talk with Utako.

329
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:40,775
[HITOMI]
Hey, wait.

330
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:43,525
Isn't that the girl who collects
cans in the morning?

331
00:17:45,817 --> 00:17:47,942
Um, can I help you?

332
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:48,525
Hi.

333
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:49,358
I'm Hitomi.

334
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:51,567
I work at the bar next door.

335
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,608
[ANZU]
Oh.

336
00:17:52,692 --> 00:17:55,275
Well, I'm Anzu,
and I pick up cans.

337
00:17:56,483 --> 00:17:57,567
I see.

338
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,483
Are you here doing
volunteer work, or...?

339
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:01,150
[ANZU]
Nah, I just sell 'em.

340
00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:04,400
Yeah, it's kinda my job.

341
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,442
[HITOMI]
What kind of job is that?

342
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:09,358
Anyway. Bye.

343
00:18:09,442 --> 00:18:10,650
Wait a second, please!

344
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:13,233
What? I'm trying to work here.

345
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:14,900
Could you come
with me somewhere?

346
00:18:14,983 --> 00:18:16,733
Uh. Look.

347
00:18:16,817 --> 00:18:19,650
I don't know you, and Yassan
says not to go with strangers.

348
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:20,692
[HITOMI]
Who's Yassan?

349
00:18:20,775 --> 00:18:24,025
The one who's making
her dig garbage?

350
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:27,233
I'll take you to a place where
you can find a bunch of cans.

351
00:18:27,317 --> 00:18:29,525
Huh?! Show me!

352
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:33,400
[HITOMI]
Mr. Abe?

353
00:18:33,483 --> 00:18:35,358
[ABE]
Hey, Hitomi, what's up?

354
00:18:35,442 --> 00:18:36,483
Your shop.

355
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:38,567
They throw out
lots of cans, correct?

356
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,733
[ABE]
Yeah, it's trash time right now.

357
00:18:40,817 --> 00:18:42,983
They're over there.

358
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:44,775
[ANZU]
Whoa!

359
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:45,900
Would you mind
letting this girl

360
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:48,275
take them all off your hands?

361
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:51,192
[ABE]
Hmm? Oh yeah. You.

362
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:53,858
You scrounge for
cans around here a lot.

363
00:18:53,942 --> 00:18:56,025
Don't ask me.
It's up to the boss.

364
00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:58,400
[HITOMI] Your manager drinks
at my bar pretty often.

365
00:18:58,483 --> 00:18:59,608
Huh?

366
00:18:59,692 --> 00:19:01,442
You're always coming
out back to slack off.

367
00:19:01,525 --> 00:19:03,317
Perhaps I should let him know?

368
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,733
Ah... Heh. You got me. Heh heh.

369
00:19:06,817 --> 00:19:09,400
You drive a hard
bargain, Hitomi.

370
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,900
I'll let you pick up the
cans whenever I'm out here.

371
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:15,567
Just don't tell my boss
I'm goofin' off on the clock.

372
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,400
[ANZU]
Wow!

373
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:18,442
I got a whole bunch at once!

374
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:19,775
Thanks, Hitomi!

375
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,317
You're amazing!

376
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,442
Heh. It's not that
big of a deal.

377
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:25,150
[ANZU]
It's a huge deal!

378
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:25,733
Oh.

379
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:26,650
I know!

380
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,275
I should invite you over!

381
00:19:28,358 --> 00:19:31,692
Yassan says it's important
to return people's favors.

382
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:33,817
[HITOMI]
Again, who is that?

383
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:40,942
[HITOMI]
But I want to go home and sleep.

384
00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:43,067
Follow me, hurry!

385
00:19:44,275 --> 00:19:45,692
[HITOMI]
This is awkward.

386
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:47,733
What must her family be like?

387
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:49,692
I assume they're extremely poor.

388
00:19:49,775 --> 00:19:50,942
[ANZU]
Hey!

389
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:52,733
C'mon, over here!

390
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,525
[HITOMI]
The park?

391
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:59,192
Ta-dah!

392
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:01,317
[HITOMI] She lives in a shanty
in the middle of the park!

393
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,858
[screams]

394
00:20:02,942 --> 00:20:05,775
[YASSAN]
Well, hello, who might this be?

395
00:20:05,858 --> 00:20:07,192
[ANZU]
Yassan!

396
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:08,400
[HITOMI]
That's him?

397
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:10,067
[ANZU] This is Hitomi,
we met this morning.

398
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:10,983
Oh?

399
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:12,817
[HITOMI]
So, he's a homeless man.

400
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,025
A friend, eh?

401
00:20:14,108 --> 00:20:14,775
Huh?

402
00:20:14,858 --> 00:20:16,483
Uh, yes.

403
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:19,150
[HITOMI]
I guess.

404
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:20,317
Uh...

405
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:27,275
[ANZU]
I've never had a friend before.

406
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:30,692
So you're really my friend, huh?

407
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:33,692
Good for you.

408
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,150
[HITOMI]
I might regret this.

409
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:37,775
[ANZU]
I hope you're hungry!

410
00:20:37,858 --> 00:20:40,192
I wanna treat you
to the fancy ramen!

411
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:42,108
They're two-hundred yen!

412
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:43,358
[HITOMI]
Uhh...

413
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:47,442
Um. Thanks a lot.

414
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:49,817
[ANZU] So how much money
do you make at your job?

415
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,942
Huh?

416
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:52,733
With all the work
I get done in a day.

417
00:20:52,817 --> 00:20:55,233
I can make about 600 yen.

418
00:20:55,317 --> 00:20:59,192
[HITOMI] I usually earn that
much in less than 30 minutes.

419
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:02,025
Ah. That's about
what I get paid.

420
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:03,025
Oh, really?

421
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:04,233
Well, it's not always the same.

422
00:21:04,317 --> 00:21:06,192
One time I brought in 750!

423
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:07,275
That's my record.

424
00:21:07,358 --> 00:21:08,317
Awesome, huh?

425
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,817
[HITOMI]
Sure is.

426
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,150
Uh-oh.

427
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:14,942
I don't think I can eat this.

428
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:18,025
Work's gonna be so much
easier from here on out!

429
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:20,608
No more walking around all day!

430
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:22,775
Well, that sounds
like an improvement!

431
00:21:22,858 --> 00:21:25,692
This means you'll have more time
to hang out and have fun, right?

432
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:26,608
Sure will!

433
00:21:26,692 --> 00:21:28,567
Hey, let's hang out now!

434
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,858
Huh? Oh, really?

435
00:21:34,025 --> 00:21:35,567
[HITOMI]
Okay.

436
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,817
You're gonna be "it" all day!

437
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:46,525
[HITOMI] How long do
we have to keep playing tag?

438
00:21:46,608 --> 00:21:49,442
Also, why are we playing tag?

439
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:51,192
Tag is stupid!

440
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:54,942
I'm so sleepy.

441
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:59,525
I can't go on.

442
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:02,692
Huh? Are you okay?

443
00:22:03,483 --> 00:22:04,983
What's wrong?

444
00:22:13,108 --> 00:22:16,358
[ANZU]
She fell asleep standing up!

445
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:50,233
[ANZU] Next time, "Three
Heads Are Better Than One."
