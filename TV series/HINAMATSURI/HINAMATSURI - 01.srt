00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:15,875
Hyaaa!

00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:17,000
[gasps]

00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:43,416
She really is the world's top
practitioner of Naikaken.

4
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,125
Care to surrender?

5
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,125
[screams]

6
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,041
I knew I should've
purchased a life-proof case!

7
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,250
Luckily we all use the
"Find your Friends" App.

8
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,666
[MAO]
Hina. Just hang in there!

9
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,291
[NITTA]
It cost us two million?

10
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,750
No, you were right
to bid aggressively.

11
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,708
That vase is one of a kind.

12
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,291
Good work.

13
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,583
I should have a
respectable collection soon.

14
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,958
Long as profits keep up.

15
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,416
Thanks to the family,

16
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,875
I have more cash than
I know what to do with.

17
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:34,208
[laughs]

18
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,083
[grunts]

19
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:37,416
Ow!

20
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,291
[NITTA]
How many pills did I take today?

21
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:51,000
Huh? Hmm...

22
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,416
Ah?!

23
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,041
Cool.

24
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,125
Think I'll get an early night.

25
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,916
[NITTA]
Well, it's still here.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,666
[HINA]
Hey.

27
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,000
[NITTA]
Hmm?

28
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,750
[HINA] Would you mind
undoing these restraints?

29
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,208
There's a button on the back.

30
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,250
[HINA]
Hey, can you hear me?

31
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,125
Yeah. All right, fine,
I'll do it.

32
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,833
What the--?

33
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,750
[gasps]

34
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:07,708
[HINA]
Clothing, please.

35
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,333
Huh?

36
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,333
Clothing, please.

37
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,125
Wait. You can't just barge
in here makin' demands.

38
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,208
How bout'cha get out of
my house, you crazy kid?

39
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,541
[NITTA]
Wait, no. No!

40
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,916
Those aren't insured yet.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,125
[TV REPORTER A] Celebrity 1A,
who was recently released

42
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,208
on bond after being arrested for
possession of illegal drugs,

43
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,750
continues to deny--

44
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,833
Hey kid, feel free to help me
clean up the mess you made.

45
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,458
I have a name. Hina.

46
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,916
Ugh. Well tell me, Hina,

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,916
ya have any idea how much
these vases were wor--?

48
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,875
[sighs]

49
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,333
You're kidding me.

50
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,083
[NITTA] Listen up,
there are two trash bins.

51
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,666
That one's for combustibles!

52
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,875
Broken glass is not combustible!

53
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,166
Uh...

54
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,375
She could kill me
if she wanted to.

55
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,583
Wouldn't even be hard.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,750
[gulps]

57
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:16,458
[NITTA]
Hina.

58
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,166
[HINA]
Hmm?

59
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,250
I'm curious.

60
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,125
Where'd you come from?

61
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,416
I can't tell you that.

62
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,708
Well, what's with that
weird power you used?

63
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,625
I can't tell you that.

64
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,625
Then, is there a reason
you showed up here?

65
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,625
Are you on some kind of mission?

66
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:33,833
Just hangin' out.

67
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,833
Seriously? Then why
don't you go back home?

68
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't have one.

69
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,500
That sounds like a you problem.

70
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:42,750
No, no, no, not that one!

71
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,541
It's really expensive!

72
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,625
[shudders]

73
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,458
You know what?

74
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,625
You should stay for a while.

75
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,375
Ah!

76
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,625
My tongue has taken some damage.

77
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,333
[sighs]
Go lick some ice.

78
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,291
[NITTA]
You're dripping.

79
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,208
Use the blow dryer.

80
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,750
Blow dryer?

81
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,000
Fine.

82
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,166
Yet another male executive has--

83
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,625
[sighs] She should turn it
off when she goes to bed.

84
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,125
Huh?

85
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,833
This is weird.

86
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:29,916
Why do I feel like
I'm turning into a parent?

87
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,708
[HINA]
My lack of personal effects

88
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,375
has proven rather inconvenient.

89
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,000
Ooooo...

90
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,333
I'm sure it is,

91
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,791
but why do I have to be
the one to foot the bill?

92
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,333
[groans]

93
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,250
Fine, we'll get
whatever you want!

94
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,500
[HINA] I need one of
these to help me sleep.

95
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,958
[NITTA]
You slept just fine last night.

96
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,208
[HINA]
I need this.

97
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,916
[NITTA] Why's it gotta
be the expensive one?

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
[HINA]
It has a cute handle.

99
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,750
These clothes are cute.

100
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,875
I'm gonna need them all.

101
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,583
This place is amazing.

102
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,250
I feel like I could
shop here all day.

103
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,666
That'll be 857,120.

104
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,958
[NITTA groans]

105
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,666
[HINA's stomach growls]

106
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,250
I take it you're hungry.

107
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,750
[HINA]
Mm-hmm.

108
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,541
Fine, want something
in particular?

109
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,583
[HINA]
High-end sushi or Kobe beef.

110
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,125
[NITTA] You know Kobe
but not blow dryers.

111
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,375
Ohhh...

112
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,541
So this is high end sushi.

113
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,250
[sighs]
What the hell am I doing here?

114
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,791
[HINA]
There's no more salmon roe.

115
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,125
What should I do?

116
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,500
Ask for it.

117
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,708
[HINA]
More salmon roe.

118
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:40,708
[SERVER]
Sure!

119
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,166
You would be a
fan of salmon roe.

120
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,458
[HINA]
More salmon roe.

121
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,125
[SERVER]
Sure!

122
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,583
Heh. Look at you go.

123
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:47,708
More salmon roe.

124
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,125
Are you trying to
make me go bankrupt?

125
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,250
[TV REPORTER B] You may want to
start packing your kid's lunch.

126
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,750
Not only does school
cafeteria food look gross...

127
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:55,791
[sighs]

128
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,875
[NITTA] If you can
get her to stay put,

129
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,333
she's just your average brat.

130
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,833
[TV REPORTER B] In other news,
the Tokyo school board

131
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,333
has dismissed a
middle school vice principal.

132
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,916
A statement was issued charging
him with the misappropriation

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,416
and embezzlement of no less than
five million yen in PTA funds.

134
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
That sounds fun.

135
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:17,333
Huh?

136
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,458
I wanna go to middle school.

137
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,041
What about that sounded fun?

138
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,041
I'm sorry, but that's
not gonna work out.

139
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,250
Ya know what?

140
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,750
I'll make it happen, for you.

141
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,416
[sighs]

142
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,625
But we need to set
a few ground rules.

143
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,125
For what?

144
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,333
For how things need to go
if we're gonna live together.

145
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:40,000
Mm-hm. You have to stop
using those powers of yours.

146
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,833
If you're gonna go to school,
that's how it has to be.

147
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,625
We don't need you givin'
the lunch lady a heart attack.

148
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,625
Sound fair?

149
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,458
[HINA]
All right, you've got a deal.

150
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,750
Huh?

151
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:52,916
Pinky swear.

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,666
I saw it on TV.

153
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,083
Pinky promise, eye to eye.

154
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:04,000
If one should lie, then they
will cry, and bleed out and die.

155
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,666
[NITTA]
What did you watch?

156
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,458
[HINA]
Hmm...

157
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,916
So this is a teddy bear.

158
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,208
This Nitta is a grown-up.

159
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,208
Yet he gives me no orders.

160
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,666
I don't have to fight anyone.

161
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,541
What a strange place, this is.

162
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,583
[NITTA] Hey, you remembered to
brush your teeth, right?

163
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,541
Hmm?

164
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,333
[NITTA]
Huh...

165
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,250
So what was all that about
you needing a teddy bear

166
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,875
to help you sleep?

167
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,875
[MATSUTANI] Class, I'd like
to introduce someone.

168
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,291
Please join me in welcoming
your new classmate, Nitta.

169
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,250
Everybody, let's help
her feel at home.

170
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,416
Okay, Nitta.

171
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,666
Would you like to
say hello to the class?

172
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,500
Hey, Nitta.

173
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,916
Are you all right, Nitta?

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,666
Teacher. Nitta isn't here.

175
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,958
Did I mess up
another kid's name?

176
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,541
But it says it right here.

177
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,208
Hina Nitta.

178
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,083
You're gonna go by
Hina Nitta from now on.

179
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,000
At school,
they'll call ya Nitta.

180
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,125
But my name's Hina.

181
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,875
[NITTA]
Go with it, will ya?

182
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:15,916
Oh, my mistake.
Sorry, I forgot I'm Nitta.

183
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,041
[CLASS]
This girl has got some issues.

184
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,500
[MISHIMA] Yeah, but we were
in grade school ourselves

185
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,875
till last year.

186
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,666
So to put it bluntly,
the Shinozuka-gumi are pissed.

187
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,333
You might wanna lay
low for a while, boss.

188
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:43,000
Eh. Calm down, will ya?

189
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,833
Take a look at Nitta.

190
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,875
He's keeping his cool.

191
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:49,791
[NITTA]
I hope nothing goes wrong

192
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,750
with her first day at school.

193
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,458
[BABA]
Is he?

194
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,916
[NITTA]
It's fine.

195
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
If something goes wrong,
then I'll deal with it myself.

196
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,041
Whoa there.

197
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,000
Hmph. I like your spirit.

198
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,916
[MATSUTANI]
So, in conclusion, the namahage

199
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,083
is often mistaken for an oni,

200
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,041
due to their similar
appearances.

201
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,125
[MISHIMA]
She fell asleep?

202
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,125
--So, in conclusion...
--So, in conclusion....

203
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,208
So, in conclusion...

204
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,208
Aww yeah! Time for lunch!

205
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,541
[MISHIMA] I can't believe
she slept through

206
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,500
our first four classes.

207
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,666
Sorry to wake you,
Nitta, but it's lunchtime.

208
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,291
Hey, uh, Hina?

209
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,750
Don't freak,
but you're drooling.

210
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,666
Uh. Wait, don't use your sleeve.

211
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,041
Here. Let me.

212
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:48,083
[HITOMI] Weird. Why do I feel
like I'm turning into a parent?

213
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,833
[WORKOUT VO]
Keep your body relaxed

214
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:54,375
while you slowly bring your
hands around and then together.

215
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,916
Breathe slowly
as you hold this pose.

216
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,375
[HINA] I think I've earned
myself a sip of sport drink.

217
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,750
[NITTA] You have to stop using
those powers of yours.

218
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:18,666
I promised.

219
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,833
[NITTA]
I'm home.

220
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,208
And I brought a vase.

221
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,708
Listen, these
things are valuable,

222
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:27,041
so I can't have you
breaking them, okay?

223
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,416
Whoa, what's with the floating?

224
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,333
Stop floating!

225
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,375
What the heck happened in here?

226
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:35,916
I have to keep using my
powers, or I lose control.

227
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,208
[NITTA]
Why didn't you say that before?

228
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,708
My vases.

229
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,541
They're all gone.

230
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,375
You've taken everything
I love away from me.

231
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,041
[HINA] I was just trying
to keep my promise.

232
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,666
[NITTA] If you'd told me
that this would happen,

233
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,916
I wouldn't have
made you promise.

234
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,416
[HINA]
When are you making dinner?

235
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,291
[NITTA]
I'm gonna need a minute.

236
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,041
Will that blow-up
last you for a while?

237
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,208
That wasn't enough,
it'll happen again soon.

238
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:07,000
Huh? What am I supposed to do?

239
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,583
[NITTA] A hotel in
the Yamanashi mountains?

240
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,333
I'm not sure that's a
good idea right now, sir.

241
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,666
It's not my project. The
developers couldn't find anybody

242
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,458
who would clear the lot for
as cheap as they were hoping.

243
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,583
So they asked me
to see who I could find.

244
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,083
They don't care how it
gets done if it's cheap.

245
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,000
You sure these guys're legit?

246
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,916
If you can hook 'em up
with some discount contractors,

247
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,666
give 'em a call.

248
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,250
Ah, hell yeah!

249
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,375
[HINA]
Where are we going?

250
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,125
[NITTA] To a place where you can
use your powers all you want.

251
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:43,333
I'm hopin' this helps us avoid
a repeat of yesterday.

252
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,416
Aren't you gonna
scold me about it?

253
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,708
Why would I?

254
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:54,625
[HINA] I erred,
yet I'm not being punished.

255
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,333
I wonder where we're going.

256
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,208
It sounds exciting.

257
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,333
We're here.

258
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,625
The boss asked me to
handle this development job.

259
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:14,583
Think you can use your powers
to uproot them, like this?

260
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,000
I think so.

261
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,166
All right, then.

262
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,416
You can use your powers
all ya want here.

263
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,166
Understood.

264
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,500
[NITTA]
Yes!

265
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,291
This is awesome!

266
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:41,833
Can ya do more?

267
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,333
Yeah, sure.

268
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,583
Something like that?

269
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,500
[NITTA]
Fantastic!

270
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,625
[HINA]
Is that all?

271
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,583
Well, uh, actually,
if you don't mind,

272
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,958
could you make 'em like this?

273
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:02,833
[NITTA chortles]
Hell to the yes!

274
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,375
That was amazing.

275
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,833
It looks perfect!

276
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:13,541
[laughs]

277
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,916
Not a bad day's work.

278
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,833
We cleared the lot
and got lumber.

279
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,500
We made a killing today!

280
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,000
Damn.

281
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:24,333
If only there were a development
bubble goin' on right now.

282
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:28,000
I didn't realize how useful
your powers could be.

283
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:29,916
What's wrong?

284
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,500
I've seen that look before.

285
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,791
Huh?

286
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,750
Those grown-up eyes.

287
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,125
I know what it means
when people get that look.

288
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,500
I think I get it.

289
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,625
I'm sure lots of people
have taken advantage of you

290
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,458
because you're just a kid.

291
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,208
In that case--

292
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:48,458
[cell phone ringing]

293
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,958
[NITTA]
Yeah, what's up?

294
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,875
What? You've gotta be kidding!

295
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,583
All right. I'm on my way now.

296
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,333
[BABA]
Nitta! You think this is funny?

297
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,208
What about the boss
getting shot made ya think

298
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,500
this'd be a good day
to bring your brat? Huh?

299
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,541
I truly am sorry, chief.

300
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,333
Tried to take her home, but she
didn't wanna be alone there.

301
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,750
What, is she your boss?

302
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,875
[NITTA]
She twisted my arm.

303
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,625
So good. I've never
had tea of such quality.

304
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,166
It's from the hundred-yen store.

305
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,000
[BABA]
You're the boss's favorite.

306
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,583
And I remember you tellin' him

307
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:23,791
that if something went wrong,
you would deal with it yourself.

308
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,375
Well, here's your chance.

309
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,291
[NITTA]
Yes, sir.

310

[SABU] The guy we have
watching Shinozuka's house

311
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,625
hasn't seen him,
so I bet he's at his office.

312
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,708
All right, then.

313
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,208
[sighs]

314
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,541
The place'll be teeming
with his men.

315
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,291
I'm screwed.

316
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:06,000
Chief knows damn
well it's a suicide mission.

317
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,250
Guess this is how
yakuza get fired.

318
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,333
Damn it.

C'mon, Nitta.

320
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,541
There's gotta be
some way out of this.

there this whole time?

00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,541
[HINA] Is someone in that
building an enemy?

325
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:25,583
[NITTA]
Huh?

326
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,958
Enemy?

327
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,833
[sighs]
Yeah, and I gotta beat him.

328
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,500
[HINA]
I'm ready for orders.

329
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,000
[NITTA]
Huh?

330
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:43,458
[NITTA] I didn't realize how
useful your powers could be.

331
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:47,208
You could order me to kill him,
so why don't you do it?

332
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,333
[sighs]

333
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,916
Have ya lost your mind, kid?

334
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,166
Huh?

335
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,791
Why should you have to
do something like that?

336
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,291
This isn't your
problem, all right?

337
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,833
[NITTA]
Hmm?

338
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,458
Hey, what're you...?

339
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,291
I'll do it anyway.

340
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,750
Where I come from,

341
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:19,750
my only reason for existing
was to carry out orders.

342
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:24,500
But you're not anything like the
grown-ups I knew in that place.

343
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,291
I like spending time
with you, Nitta.

344
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,083
Huh?! Hey, come back here!

345
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,083
[NITTA]
Whoa. She finally said my name.

346
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,291
Not the point, Nitta!

347
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,250
You can't let her
do your dirty work!

348
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,041
[NITTA]
Hina!

349
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:46,416
[NITTA]
Hina!

350
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,625
[HENCHMAN A]
Get outta here, kid.

351
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,833
Owie! Ow... ie...

352
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,000
[NITTA]
Uh...

353
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,583
[HENCHMAN B]
Die, you little bitch! Owie!

354
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,250
[HENCHMEN]
Owie! Owie! Owie!

355
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,041
[HENCHMAN E]
She went upstairs!

356
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,208
[HENCHMAN F]
What do you want? I'll kill you!

357
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,375
Owie!

358
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:08,791
[HENCHMEN]
Owie! Owie! Owie! Owie! Owie!

359
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,583
[SHINOZUKA]
Ow, ow, owie. Ow. Ow.

360
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,458
Is this one the boss?

361
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,375
Uh-huh.

362
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,375
[SHINOZUKA]
No fair.

363
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,375
Color me impressed, Nitta.

364
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,250
To think that you'd
single-handedly

365
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,375
defeat the Shinozuka-gumi!

366
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:33,875
Awesome.

367
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,291
He's a friggin' madman!

368
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,375
I'd follow him anywhere!

369
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,708
Huh?

370
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,500
I doubt that this'll come
as a surprise to you.

371
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,916
But in honor
of our victory here,

372
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,125
I've named you the
family's top soldier.

373
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,083
Well done!

374
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,125
[NITTA chuckles]

375
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,958
You really
shouldn't have, chief.

376
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,000
So good.

377
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,625
I've never had
tea of such quality.

378
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,250
Same cheap tea
you had last time.

379
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:54,750
[NITTA]
So Hina.

380
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,875
Is there anything I can get'cha?

381
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:57,958
[HINA]
Why?

382
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,666
You know, because
you helped me out.

383
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,666
But you bought me stuff earlier.

384
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,541
We made a boatload
of money today.

385
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:04,833
And when someone
does you a favor,

386
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:08,125
you should always get them back.

387
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:12,416
Well, how 'bout... salmon roe?

388
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,250
Hmph. Sounds good.

389
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,541
Whoa. What is this?

390
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,416
Best salmon roe bowl in town.

391
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,000
I had no idea that there was
a way to eat this much at once.

392
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,083
Why'd we bother with sushi?

393
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,625
[NITTA]
Say, Hina.

394
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,916
I don't know anything about
what your life was like

395
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,416
before I met you.

396
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,666
And I don't really want to know.

397
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,458
But out in the
world of grown-ups,

398
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:43,541
when you do good work,
you get a reward to match.

399
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:50,416
[HINA]
You mean I deserve this?

400
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,291
Thank you for this food.

401
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,125
All right, so how's it taste?

402
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,250
[HINA] I don't have
the words to describe it.

403
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,875
Good. Really, really, good.

404
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,000
That's all you
could come up with?

405
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,750
At last, I'm a
woman fully bloomed.

406
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,500
Absolutely not.

407
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:19,791
Nitta.

408
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,666
You are using organic
ingredients, right?

409
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,416
I refuse to be shamed for
cooking on a budget, okay?

410
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:31,041
What about our pinkie promise?

411
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,750
Well, I'm going to school now.

412
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,500
[NITTA]
'Kay.

413
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,916
Huh?

414
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,083
[NITTA]
Is this from...

415
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,541
...when Hina first showed up?

416
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,916
Hey, Nitta.

417
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,000
[HINA]
Ew.

418
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,083
Gross.

419
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:34,583
You looked just
as weird in this thing!

420
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:38,458
Hey. Wait. Come back!

421
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,083
You can't just leave me here!

422
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,916
Hina, come on, please!

423
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,833
I just have to hit that button.

424
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:54,458
One good roll into that
table and I'm a free man!

425
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:01,208
Oh yeah, here we go!

426
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:02,958
Not that way.

427
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,791
It's hopeless.

428
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,250
[NITTA]
Hina, please.

429
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,416
Press the button.

430
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:31,000
So I can make us breakfast.

431
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,041
[HINA]
Terminator.
