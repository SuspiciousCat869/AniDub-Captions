00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,150
I think you need a smaller size.

3
00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:18,900
Nope.

4
00:00:18,983 --> 00:00:20,983
It fits perfect!

5
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:23,358
My clothes've always
been too big.

00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,233
[MR. HAYASHI]
I think you're ready now, Anzu.

7
00:00:28,317 --> 00:00:30,108
But before you start your shift,

8
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:32,525
there's one thing
you need to know.

9
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:34,358
Every customer's a god to us.

10
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:35,900
Huuuh?!

11
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:41,942
I mean, they're godlike,
is more like it.

12
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:43,442
Just be as polite as possible

13
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:45,108
when you're speaking
to them, okay?

14
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:46,358
You got it!

15
00:00:46,442 --> 00:00:49,233
[MR. HAYASHI] You mean,
"Yes sir, I'll do that."

16
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:52,733
When we're working, you need to
speak formally with us as well.

17
00:00:52,817 --> 00:00:54,525
[ANZU]
Yes, sir, I'll do that!

18
00:00:54,608 --> 00:00:55,442
Honey?

19
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:57,650
Let her shadow you today.

20
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:00,692
Okay, I'll show you how
we greet our customers.

21
00:01:00,775 --> 00:01:03,650
For now, follow me around
and see how I do things here.

22
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:05,817
So, I don't have to do anything?

23
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,650
[MRS. HAYASHI]
Learning is part of your job.

[ANZU]
Mm!

00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:10,525
Uh! Yes, ma'am.

00:01:10,608 --> 00:01:12,108
I'll do that!

[MRS. HAYASHI]
Welcome, sirs.

Thank you, please come again.

You don't have to sit
at attention, sweetheart.

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,483
[MRS. HAYASHI]
That's too relaxed.

31
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:05,442
Since there's nobody
here right now,

32
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:08,067
why don't you study the menu
and learn about the dishes?

33
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,900
Yes, ma'am, I'll do that.

[ANZU shrieks]

35
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,275
The twice-cooked pork
is 800 yen?

36
00:03:17,358 --> 00:03:20,192
I could buy eight
cup ramens for that!

37
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:21,983
[MRS. HAYASHI]
I need a tissue!

38
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:23,567
Get one for me, too!

39
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,775
All right, time to see how well
you do greeting a real customer.

Hey. It's Anzu.

Nitta.

45
00:03:34,817 --> 00:03:35,608
Why are you here?

46
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:37,858
To get some food, why else?

47
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:39,817
Don't forget. Formal.

48
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:48,150
Hello.

49
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:50,400
Are you gentlemen ready
to order something?

50
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:52,275
Ramen and fried rice, of course.

51
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:53,567
Twice-cooked pork for me.

[ANZU gasps]

00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,233
Twice... Twice-cooked...

You must be an extremely
wealthy person, sir.

Not sure how to take that.

and twice-cooked pork.

[MR. HAYASHI]
Got it, and by the way.

58
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:09,567
If you know the customer,

59
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,275
then it's okay to speak
a little more casually.

60
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:15,567
Okay, so everybody is a
god except for this guy?

He's just a mere mortal?

Great customer service.

What are you
doing waiting tables, huh?

You'll probably figure out soon

that that's not as big
a deal as you think it is.

There's not that much in there.

You can throw away
the chopsticks.

Huh? We're not gonna
wash and reuse 'em?

But Shige, he told me
it was better not

97
00:05:40,817 --> 00:05:42,567
to let them go to waste.

[MR. HAYASHI]
Oops.

99
00:05:44,317 --> 00:05:47,608
Everyone you meet becomes
part of you in some way.

100
00:05:47,692 --> 00:05:49,483
I was trying to help,
but I'll probably end up having

101
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:52,858
to take that back
before it's over.

Yeah. What's wrong?

Please use hot water, Anzu.
I insist!

Well, you're the one
who wanted to go.

Sorry, but if you're
that bored with school,

163
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:22,817
You're smart.

164
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,858
Oh no, I could never win!

165
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:26,733
You'd be perfect though, Sayo.

166
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:28,108
Since you wear glasses!

167
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:30,108
[SAYO]
What's that supposed to mean?

168
00:08:30,192 --> 00:08:31,942
What does a student council do?

169
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:33,858
[HITOMI]
Uh. Uh...

170
00:08:33,942 --> 00:08:35,983
They set budgets for
the school sometimes,

171
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:38,400
and they come up with
new rules, stuff like that.

172
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:39,650
[SAYO]
Maybe in anime.

173
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:41,067
[KENGO]
It means you've got the power.

174
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,775
You're like the king!

175
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:43,858
[HINA]
Whoa.

176
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:45,067
They rule the school?

177
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,400
Yeah, and the student
council president

178
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:47,817
gets to boss them around!

179
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,400
Stop talking out yer butt.

180
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:51,525
[KENGO]
Oh, come on, it's just Hina.

181
00:08:51,608 --> 00:08:53,150
The boss, huh?

182
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:56,275
[laughs] Sure is great
to be in a position of power!

183
00:08:56,358 --> 00:08:57,150
I'm the boss!

184
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:58,733
I get to make the rules!

185
00:08:58,817 --> 00:09:00,608
[GOOD GUY]
Dammit, I can't oppose this guy,

186
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:02,317
he's got too much authority!

187
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,900
[laughs]

188
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:07,775
--[BAD GUY] Yeart! Yeart! Yeart!
--[GOOD GUY] Owwie! Owwie!

189
00:09:07,858 --> 00:09:09,108
[MATSUTANI]
Okay.

190
00:09:09,192 --> 00:09:11,650
Who here would like
to run for student council?

191
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:12,900
Huh?

192
00:09:12,983 --> 00:09:14,650
No.

193
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:18,650
Okay, then. Anybody else?

194
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:21,400
Anyone? Please?

195
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:24,608
Hina Nitta.

196
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:26,067
Are you insane?

197
00:09:29,233 --> 00:09:31,108
Nitta has every right
to run if she wants,

198
00:09:31,192 --> 00:09:32,775
I guess I can't stop her.

199
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:34,942
[HITOMI gasps]

200
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:37,108
What has gotten into you, Hina?

201
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:38,817
I'm gonna become
student council president,

202
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,608
so I can rule the school.

203
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:42,233
[HITOMI]
The president?

204
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:44,900
You just had to put those
ideas in her head, Kengo!

205
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:45,775
Sorry!

206
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:46,983
But, hey, I thought first years

207
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,650
could only campaign
to be members.

208
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:50,567
[SAYO]
Hang on.

209
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,733
I want to watch
this crash and burn.

210
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:54,817
[HITOMI]
Wow, Sayo.

211
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,400
[MATSUTANI]
Listen.

212
00:09:56,483 --> 00:09:58,983
You'll have to give a speech at
the school assembly next week.

213
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:00,108
Can you handle that?

214
00:10:00,192 --> 00:10:01,733
I got this.

215
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:03,025
[MATSUTANI]
In all my years of teaching,

216
00:10:03,108 --> 00:10:06,692
I've never been more
scared by "I got this."

217
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,358
You have some bright
students in your class.

218
00:10:11,442 --> 00:10:14,108
I hear one of them's running
for the student council!

219
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:18,233
[TEACHER]
He just blew me off.

220
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:24,108
What are you working on, Hina?

221
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:26,442
[HINA] All the candidates
have to give a speech.

222
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,108
Here's what I have so far.

223
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:30,733
Let's see!

224
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:33,025
[HINA] "I want to sleep
without getting scolded.

225
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:35,525
I want more for lunch.
The end."

226
00:10:35,608 --> 00:10:39,192
[screams]

227
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:40,483
[HITOMI]
Hina.

228
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:43,025
You were supposed
to write a formal speech,

229
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:47,067
but this just looks like
a bulleted list of demands!

230
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,775
[NITTA] Running for
student council president?

231
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:50,358
[HINA]
Yeah.

232
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:51,067
Great.

233
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,692
Gimme one second.

234
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,650
There.

235
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:59,483
Sorry, guess
I was still half-asleep.

236
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:00,067
'Kay.

237
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,192
I'm listening.

238
00:11:01,275 --> 00:11:02,275
Running where?

239
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:04,025
To be the
student council president.

240
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:06,483
So I wasn't dreaming after all.

241
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:09,358
First-year students can run
for president at your school?

242
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:11,608
Man, things have really
changed since my day.

243
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:14,775
I wrote a speech,
but someone told me it was bad.

244
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:17,150
Let me see, then.

245
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:18,400
Yeah, that's bad.

246
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:19,567
[HINA]
Help me.

247
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,108
You'll have to figure
this out yourself.

248
00:11:21,192 --> 00:11:22,358
I'm busy.

249
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:24,483
[HINA] But, Nitta,
you're the one who told me

250
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:28,025
to find a way to make school
interesting, remember?

251
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:31,692
[NITTA]
So that's Hina's new strategy

252
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,442
for bugging the crap out of me.

253
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:34,900
Come on!

254
00:11:34,983 --> 00:11:37,358

stands a chance of winning.

00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:38,858
[BOSS]
Huh?

256
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:41,400
Hina's trying to make
something happen.

257
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:43,817
And look at you,
sittin' on your ass.

Here's a thought.

261
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:51,775
Why don't we get our company
lawyer to write her a speech?

--[NITTA] What?
--[BOSS] Hey, now!

263
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,733
That's what
I'm talking about, Baba!

264
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:58,483
Did one of you have a run-in
with the police or something?

265
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:01,275
No, no, it's far more
serious than that.

266
00:12:01,358 --> 00:12:02,567
Oh. Dear!

267
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,108
I'll do what I can to help!

00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:05,942
[BABA]
He actually called him.

269
00:12:07,483 --> 00:12:08,983
[VICE PRINCIPAL] And now,
we'll hear the speeches

270
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:11,942
from our candidates
for the student council.

271
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:14,858
Hina Nitta from Class 1-3.

272
00:12:18,942 --> 00:12:19,983
[TAKASHI]
Oh, man.

273
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:22,025
This is making me nervous.

274
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,692
Me too. Hina's bound
to screw this up somehow.

275
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:34,067
My name's Hina Nitta
from Class 1-3.

276
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,608
When I'm student
council president--

277
00:12:35,692 --> 00:12:37,150
[VICE PRINCIPAL]
Just a minute!

278
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:41,358
First-year students can only
run for secretary or treasurer.

279
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:45,900
When I become
student council president...

280
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:47,358
[STUDENTS]
She ignored him!

281
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:49,567
...the first order of business
will be improvements

282
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,150
to our school lunches.

283
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:53,692
Some of you may know our
school has been ordering them

284
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:57,483
exclusively from Asaka Lunch
Center for the past 25 years.

285
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:59,483
However, the long-standing
contract that we,

286
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:02,525
as well as many neighboring
schools, have with Asaka

287
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:05,900
is not favorable in terms
of cost or food quality

288
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:07,108
and must be replaced

289
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:09,317
with something more
beneficial to students.

290
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,233
I propose choosing a supplier
through competitive bidding.

291
00:13:12,317 --> 00:13:13,858
This will help us
to lower costs,

292
00:13:13,942 --> 00:13:15,733
while at the same
time increasing...

293
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:16,692
Is she...

294
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:18,275
...making sense right now?

295
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:19,900
By enacting this change,

296
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:21,942
the result will be better
food safety as well as

297
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:25,025
better health and nutrition
all over campus.

298
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:27,775
Uh...

299
00:13:27,858 --> 00:13:30,025
Take a deep breath
here and hold it.

300
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:30,900
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

301
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:32,275
Deep breath?

302
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:34,692
[HINA] Of course, once
the food quality has risen,

303
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:36,400
the student body's
daily need for naps

304
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,817
will also naturally increase.

305
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,317
[MATSUTANI]
Something's not right here.

306
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,983
[HINA] Raise arm here
for dramatic effect.

307
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:48,442
My next proposal,
is afternoon naps.

308
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:50,858
Did she really say
"afternoon naps"?

309
00:13:50,942 --> 00:13:53,150
I'm more concerned
with the arm thing.

310
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,650
[HINA]
Please observe this data

311
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,942
on the benefits
of regular napping.

312
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:02,525
I believe these charts
speak for themselves.

313
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,150
[STUDENTS]
I don't think they do!

314
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:05,775
Thank you all for your time.

315
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:06,942
This is the conclusion

316
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:09,983
of my student council
candidate speech.

317
00:14:11,942 --> 00:14:14,650
Bow to the audience.

318
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:16,358
It may have been
a bit unorthodox,

319
00:14:16,442 --> 00:14:18,483
but I thought it was
an excellent speech.

320
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,775
Well, aside from the
fact that it grossly

321
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:23,775
overreaches the authority
of the student council.

322
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:30,400
[SAYO] We knew you
weren't going to be president,

323
00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:32,400
but secretary's cool.

324
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,442
[HITOMI]
Hina, wait!

325
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:41,400
Huh? Something wrong?

326
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:43,567
I didn't get to
take over the school.

327
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,192
Probably for the best.

328
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:48,983
Anyway, what do you say we
go out for dinner somewhere?

329
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,608
Any special requests?

330
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:53,608
[HINA]
Salmon roe!

331
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,025
Really?

332
00:14:55,108 --> 00:14:57,400
Hina hasn't shown up to a single
student council meeting?

333
00:14:57,483 --> 00:14:58,192
[COUNCIL MEMBER A]
Nope.

334
00:14:58,275 --> 00:14:59,400
The president's had enough

335
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,525
and wants me to drag
her there if I have to.

336
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:02,275
I know.

337
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:04,275
I'll bring you instead!

338
00:15:04,358 --> 00:15:05,483
[COUNCIL MEMBER A]
Same difference.

339
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:06,858
[HITOMI]
Huh?

340
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:11,108
It's all done, President.

341
00:15:11,192 --> 00:15:12,608
Perfect.

342
00:15:13,775 --> 00:15:15,025
What's this?

343
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:17,358
[HITOMI] I thought it'd be
easier to read that way.

344
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:18,442
[HITOMI]
I need to go.

345
00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:20,525
I'm supposed to open today.

346
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:23,108
I went ahead and
reorganized these, too.

347
00:15:23,192 --> 00:15:24,275
[GOROU]
Huh.

348
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:25,650
That does make more sense.

349
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:27,192
[HITOMI]
Just let me leave.

350
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:28,942
Those forms for
the sports festival.

351
00:15:29,025 --> 00:15:30,400
[HITOMI]
Already finished them.

352
00:15:30,483 --> 00:15:31,608
Hurry up!

353
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:32,733
[GOROU]
I'm glad you came today.

354
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:34,150
I was getting worried.

355
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:34,858
Huh?

356
00:15:34,942 --> 00:15:36,067
Good job, Nitta.

357
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,025
[HITOMI]
Mishima, actually.

358
00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:39,317
I'd better get going.

359
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,525
[GOROU]
Wait a second!

360
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:43,775
Can you come to every meeting?

361
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:47,150
We need a secretary,
and Nitta's never gonna show.

362
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:49,608
Welcome to student council!

363
00:15:49,692 --> 00:15:57,192
[COUNCIL MEMBERS] Welcome!
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

364
00:15:57,275 --> 00:15:59,775
[NITTA] So, Utako,
when are we getting dinner?

365
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:00,775
Well...

366
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:02,025
I dunno, Nitta.

367
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:03,567
Work is pretty busy.

368
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:07,317
But the place is always empty,
so what's your next excuse?

369
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,858
How can you say that?

370
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:11,733
It may be empty, but it's mine,
and I have to watch over it!

371
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:13,192
[NITTA]
What are you, a gargoyle?

372
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:17,900
[NITTA sighs]

373
00:16:17,983 --> 00:16:20,400
How do I get Utako
to go out with me?

374
00:16:20,483 --> 00:16:21,442
Something wrong?

375
00:16:21,525 --> 00:16:23,483
Nothing you
can help with, kiddo.

376
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,483
You'll feel better
if you talk to somebody.

377
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,608
Yeah. You might be right.

378
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:30,733
That's the last thing
I was expecting

379
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:32,442
to hear outta your mouth.

380
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,858
Got it from TV.

381
00:16:33,942 --> 00:16:34,817
'Course you did.

382
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,650
I shoulda guessed that.

383
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:41,608
Okay, so here's my problem.

384
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:46,817
[NITTA] You're about to
ask a child for dating advice.

385
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,358
Dammit, me, where's your pride?

386
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,983
[HITOMI]
Wow, he really likes her!

387
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:54,275
I have seen him ask
her out a few times.

388
00:16:54,358 --> 00:16:56,108
[HINA]
Yeah, she keeps saying no.

389
00:16:56,192 --> 00:16:57,733
[HITOMI]
I see.

390
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,483
Hey! But if they
did get together.

391
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:03,650
I guess that would make Utako
your new mom, wouldn't it, Hina?

392
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:04,733
Huh? My mom?

393
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:06,233
Oh! I'm sorry!

394
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:10,108
I forgot, Hina's mom is, um...

395
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:14,025
A mom. Nitta has one.

396
00:17:14,108 --> 00:17:15,442
[HITOMI]
That's right!

397
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:18,775
So what's the fastest
way for me to get them together?

398
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:20,150
Uh...

399
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:22,233
I don't think I'm the
best person to answer that.

400
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:23,692
I'm only a
middle school student.

401
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:26,192
I don't know the first thing
about getting a boyfriend!

402
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:29,400
I wonder what
having a mom is like.

403
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:32,858
[HITOMI]
Poor Hina!

404
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:35,192
She never knew
her mother at all!

405
00:17:35,275 --> 00:17:36,442
[NITTA]
God, why?

406
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:37,483
God, why?

407
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:39,108
[HINA]
What?

408
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:41,483
Look, I know I can't
bring your mother back

409
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:43,650
from the dead
or anything, but...

410
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:44,608
...I swear!

411
00:17:44,692 --> 00:17:46,067
I'll help you somehow!

412
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,025
Don't worry!

413
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,900
[HINA]
Thanks, I guess.

414
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:50,775
[HITOMI]
Here we go, Hina.

415
00:17:50,858 --> 00:17:53,275
Just brag about Nitta
as much as you can

416
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:55,567
and casually mention
them going on a date.

417
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,275
Got it?

418
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:57,858
[HINA]
Yup.

419
00:17:59,108 --> 00:17:59,817
Oh, hey.

420
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,817
You brought Hina with you.

421
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:07,942
Nitta wants you to
go on a date with him.

422
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:11,400
[HITOMI] What part of "casual"
did she not understand?

423
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:12,900
That's classy.

424
00:18:12,983 --> 00:18:14,192
I rejected him too many times,

425
00:18:14,275 --> 00:18:16,567
so he gets his daughter
to come manipulate me.

426
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,733
[HITOMI]
Uh-oh.

427
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:20,608
That made her impression
of him even worse!

428
00:18:20,692 --> 00:18:21,900
That's not it at all!

429
00:18:21,983 --> 00:18:24,067
Hina just saw the
chemistry between you two--

430
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,317
Sure.

431
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,858
Yeah, you're right.

432
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:28,567
It's Hina.

433
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,233
Hurry! Say something
positive about Nitta!

434
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:33,900
Nitta's really cool.

435
00:18:33,983 --> 00:18:37,233
He buys me food and
presents whenever I want.

436
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:40,525
[HITOMI]
That just means he's convenient!

437
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,150
[HITOMI]
Come on,

438
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:44,650
can't you at least go on
one little date with him?

439
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:46,650
It won't be that bad!

440
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:48,233
It's not like it's gonna
make any difference

441
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:50,358
if you're not at the bar!

442
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:55,358
[UTAKO]
Fine, then.

443
00:18:55,442 --> 00:18:56,400
Huh?

444
00:18:56,483 --> 00:18:59,108
[UTAKO]
I'll go. Are you happy now?

445
00:18:59,192 --> 00:19:01,525
[TV HOSTS]
Stepmothers are fun!

446
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,192
[HINA]
Stepmother.

447
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,858
[HINA]
Nitta and Mika had black hair?

448
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:09,608
Hey, I'm back.

449
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,358
What's up?

450
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,025
I'm trying to
learn about mothers.

451
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,067
What for?

452
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,733
'Cause Utako's gonna be my mom.

453
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:18,442
[NITTA]
That's way too fast!

454
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,442
You really got me a date?

455
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:21,317
[HINA]
Mm-hm.

456
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,442
She's not messin' around!

457
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:24,733
Then again,
I have been pretty vocal

458
00:19:24,817 --> 00:19:28,025
about the whole thing recently.

459
00:19:28,108 --> 00:19:29,442
And here I thought having a kid

460
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:32,025
would lose me points
with the ladies.

461
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:35,525
She's just the
secret weapon I need!

462
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:37,608
What a smart girl!

463
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:38,900
Good job, Hina!

464
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:50,817
[NITTA laughs]

465
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,817
[HINA]
Owwie!

466
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,192
[HINA]
It's almost time for your date.

467
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:07,400
Yeah. But I can't
just ditch you.

468
00:20:07,483 --> 00:20:11,150
It's my fault your leg got
busted up in the first place.

469
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:12,733
She can wait.

470
00:20:12,817 --> 00:20:15,942
I can't go out and have fun, not
if you're stuck in the hospital.

471
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:17,817
[HINA]
It's okay.

472
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,942
I really want to
have my own mom.

473
00:20:21,025 --> 00:20:23,400
[NITTA]
Hina.

474
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:25,483
[HINA]
Go, Nitta.

475
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:28,358
Huh? How can I say no?

476
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,275
All right, then.

477
00:20:31,358 --> 00:20:33,983
When I come back,
you'll have a mommy!

478
00:20:37,358 --> 00:20:41,775
Now you've got me
hoping for it too, kid.

479
00:20:41,858 --> 00:20:45,692
You've seen my tears, Hina,
but don't show me yours yet!

480
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:47,692
Not till you get
to meet your mom.

481
00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:51,817
Because then,
they'll be tears of joy.

482
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,650
I promise you, Hina.

483
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:55,567
Even though I'm
just a lowly yakuza,

484
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,400
the three of us are gonna
have a warm and happy home,

485
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:02,483
where we smile and laugh and
have fun together all the time!

486
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:03,983
Hang on, Hina.

487
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:06,233
I'll show you that I,
Yoshifumi Nitta,

488
00:21:06,317 --> 00:21:08,900
can be the perfect family man!

489
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:39,900
[HITOMI]
What? You turned him down?

490
00:21:39,983 --> 00:21:41,233
[UTAKO]
I had to.

491
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:42,983
Hina's completely
attached to him,

492
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:46,400
and Nitta couldn't stop talking
about her all day today.

493
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:47,733
I just don't know

494
00:21:47,817 --> 00:21:50,275
if there's enough room
in there for me, you know?

495
00:21:50,358 --> 00:21:52,942
So I told him I'm not
into sad, single dads.

496
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:54,067
You said that?

497
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,275
[UTAKO]
Why not?

498
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:56,858
Don't you think I should
be straightforward?

499
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:59,858
[HITOMI] That goes a little
beyond straightforward.

500
00:21:59,942 --> 00:22:01,358
Yikes.

501
00:22:08,192 --> 00:22:10,775
[NITTA]
Hina! Mommy's here!

502
00:22:10,858 --> 00:22:12,025
Come on, hun.

503
00:22:12,108 --> 00:22:13,650
Smile for me!

504
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,192
Er, please?

505
00:22:15,275 --> 00:22:16,733
Just a little smile?

506
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:50,650
[HITOMI] Next time,
"And It's the Same Old Hina."
