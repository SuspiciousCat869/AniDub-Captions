1
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:16,692
[CHIEF]
Uh, anybody got a story idea?

2
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:17,525
[SETA]
I do.

3
00:00:17,608 --> 00:00:18,900
[OTHERS]
Huh?

4
00:00:18,983 --> 00:00:20,483
[SETA] There's an interview
I've been wanting to get

5
00:00:20,567 --> 00:00:22,317
for an in-depth profile.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,983
Oh? Who's that?

7
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:26,567
A yakuza legend known as Nitta.

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,067
One of the Ashikawa group--

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,275
he's more famous for
brains than brawn,

10
00:00:30,358 --> 00:00:31,567
but they had some crazy feud

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,733
and he beat all of
Shinozuka's guys by himself.

12
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:36,275
[CHIEF]
Hmm...

13
00:00:36,358 --> 00:00:37,858
[SETA] I like the idea
of doing a deep dive

14
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:39,817
on popular yakuza businesses.

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,025
But I think following a
big-name mobster like him

16
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:43,900
would get a lot of buzz, too.

17
00:00:46,817 --> 00:00:48,233
Sure.

18
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:51,108
[CAMERAMAN]
Wow, Seta, you did it!

19
00:00:51,192 --> 00:00:53,692
Get ready, he's finally puttin'
me in charge of a project,

20
00:00:53,775 --> 00:00:55,858
so I'm really gonna
make this thing count!

21
00:00:55,942 --> 00:00:57,567
Let's go, crew!

22
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,442
[MAN A, CAMERAMAN]
Yeah!

23
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:03,358
[SETA] And so I, Daisuke
Seta, began my research.

24
00:01:03,442 --> 00:01:06,400
Risky assignments like this are
what makes a great journalist.

25
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,775
Even so, I took all the
necessary precautions.

26
00:01:11,025 --> 00:01:14,275
[NITTA]
What? TV documentary?

27
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:15,525
About my life?

28
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:16,400
Yes.

29
00:01:16,483 --> 00:01:17,442
[NITTA grunts]

30
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:21,608
[SETA]
Yoshifumi Nitta.

31
00:01:21,692 --> 00:01:23,858
He looks calm, but I
bet that's just a front

32
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:25,942
for his violent personality.

33
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:29,400
Sorry, pal, but I don't really
do any one-on-one interviews.

34
00:01:29,483 --> 00:01:31,233
[SETA] Guess I'll have
to use different tactics

35
00:01:31,317 --> 00:01:33,233
for dealing with guys like him.

36
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:34,650
It's such an honor
to be talking to

37
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:37,233
the hottest name in the
yakuza scene right now.

38
00:01:37,317 --> 00:01:38,400
[NITTA]
Uh--

39
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:39,692
I wish you'd let us document

40
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:42,192
your ascension to yakuza
greatness, Mr. Nitta.

41
00:01:42,275 --> 00:01:44,067
I promise all you have
to do is be yourself

42
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,483
and you'll be a
superstar in no time.

43
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,775
[SETA] I'm putting my life
on the line for this project.

44
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:52,858
I can't back down now.

45
00:01:57,275 --> 00:01:58,400
Where's the harm?

46
00:01:58,483 --> 00:02:00,400
[SETA]
Thus began my tell-all interview

47
00:02:00,483 --> 00:02:04,442
with the infamous yakuza
member, Yoshifumi Nitta.

48
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:44,317
[SETA]
Um... So, uh...

49
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,608
Who's she?

50
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:48,400
Her? She's got a broken leg,

51
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:50,775
so I'm givin' her
a lift to school.

52
00:03:50,858 --> 00:03:53,233
But she's a little girl.

53
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,483
Anywho,

54
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,942
what made you choose the
yakuza lifestyle, sir?

55
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:59,150
[NITTA] I was working
part-time during college

56
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:00,733
tryin' to start my own company

57
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:03,192
and my workplace
had yakuza ties.

58
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:04,733
After being exposed to that,

59
00:04:04,817 --> 00:04:07,192
I figured I might make more
money by joining up with them.

60
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:09,442
Oh, I see. So it
was for the money.

61
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:13,442
I guess money was part of it,
but that's not the only reason.

62
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:14,692
Huh?

63
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:16,692
[NITTA] It's also about
loyalty and humanity.

64
00:04:16,775 --> 00:04:20,067
My dad died when I was young,
so I wanted to help my family.

65
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,025
[SETA]
Wow, that's really why?

66
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:23,483
I'm sure things are even tougher

67
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,317
now that you have
a daughter, too.

68
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,150
Oh, no, this isn't my daughter.
I'm just looking after her.

69
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:29,733
[HINA]
No, I am.

70
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:33,275
Yeah, well it's not by choice.
There's no one else to take you.

71
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:34,567
'Kay.

72
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,900
So, then, are you dating
anybody right now?

73
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:40,858
I hear yakuza guys like you tend
to get around with a lot women.

74
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:42,525
[NITTA]
Women, huh?

75
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:45,483
I was interested in a
girl not too long ago,

76
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:48,483
but she just wants me to buy her
delicious dinners and drinks.

77
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:51,358
Oh. Uh, what about
you, little girl?

78
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:53,858
What's it like
living with Nitta?

79
00:04:53,942 --> 00:04:57,650
Nitta makes me food, so I think
he's a pretty good person.

80
00:04:57,733 --> 00:05:00,817
Quit it, wouldja, you're
embarrassing yourself.

81
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,067
What was your life like before?

82
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,692
Uh... I did my best
to follow orders.

83
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:10,567
Is it just me, or is
he a nice, normal guy?

84
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,775
[SETA groans]

85
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:17,775
[HINA]
You have an extra meatball.

86
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:22,608
--[BYU] Rairaiken!
--[HOMDA groans]

87
00:05:22,692 --> 00:05:24,192
I'm a killing machine.

88
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:26,233
Nitta, you suck.

89
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:29,525
I keep waiting for him
to do something scary.

90
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:31,192
[SETA]
This is all a charade, right?

91
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:32,983
Yeah, it has to be!

92
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:36,983
We just need to dig deeper
to see his true colors.

93
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:38,608
I wonder...

94
00:05:38,692 --> 00:05:40,983
Wild stories about him?

95
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:44,442
[BOTH laugh]

96
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:47,233
No way! He's, like, the
nicest guy you'll ever meet!

97
00:05:47,317 --> 00:05:48,900
[NITTA'S MOM]
You're the wild one, dear.

98
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:50,317
Yeah, that's true.

99
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,983
You know, chasing
down delinquents,

100
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:55,108
using 'em to practice illegal
karate moves, that sorta thing.

101
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:57,775
Turns out you can get suspended
from school for that, though.

102
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,483
[MIKA, NITTA'S MOM laugh]

103
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:02,317
[BABA]
What?

104
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,692
It's a documentary about you?

105
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:07,483
That's something. You're
a real bigshot now, eh?

106
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,233
I'm sorry, sir.

107
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,150
Look, don't give the
president a hard time.

108
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:16,442
[SETA] It's becoming clear
that my plan is going astray.

109
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:18,108
[NITTA]
Hey, Sabu.

110
00:06:18,192 --> 00:06:19,733
Did you get the
old man's present?

111
00:06:19,817 --> 00:06:22,233
Oh. Sorry, I forgot.
I'll pick it up soon.

112
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:23,942
Try to do better, okay?

113
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:25,150
I will.

114
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:29,025
That's all you're gonna do?

115
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:31,442
You didn't even
curse the guy out!

116
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,108
He's a hopeless dumbass.

117
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,983
There's no point in scolding
him every time. [gasps]

118
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,525
Quit with the everyman act.

119
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:40,275
When are you gonna start showing
us the tough guy you are?

120
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,483
[NITTA]
Everyman?

121
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,942
[SETA]
What kind of yakuza are you?

122
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:45,192
At this rate, the audience'll
think you're a wuss!

123
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:46,775
You're confusing me.

124
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:48,775
[SABU] It's okay, boss.
You can yell at me!

125
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:49,983
[NITTA, SETA]
Huh?

126
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:51,567
[SABU] I can't let you
look like a pushover

127
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,192
on national television!

128
00:06:53,275 --> 00:06:55,192
Take this ashtray and
slap me in the head.

129
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:56,858
That'll teach me a lesson!

130
00:06:56,942 --> 00:06:59,525
[NITTA] Wish he'd put that
much passion into his job.

131
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:01,483
All right, let's take
this from the top.

132
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:05,067
Three, two, one, and action!

133
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,692
Uh, hey, punk.

134
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:08,525
D'ya pick up that
thing yet or what?

135
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:10,817
Ah! Sorry, boss,
I totally forgot.

136
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,567
I'll go pick one up
right now, though.

137
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,983
[NITTA]
Huh?

138
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:16,567
Damn you!

139
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,817
That's it, come here!

140
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,942
Who the hell do you
think I am, crap-stain?

141
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,983
[SABU sobs]
I'm sorry!

142
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:26,608
[NITTA]
Look what you did, nitwit!

143
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:29,983
Ya spilled my ashtray.
Now you better clean it up! Now!

144

Yes, sir, right away, sir!

Cut!

146
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:35,567
Aw, yeah, that's more like it!

147
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,525
Are you okay?

148
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:38,942
No. Too far, man.

149
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,608
[NITTA] He's bleeding.
Somebody get the first aid kit!

150
00:07:41,692 --> 00:07:43,650
[SETA]
But it didn't end there.

151
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:45,442
[SETA] Not going to
the gentleman's club?

152
00:07:45,525 --> 00:07:48,358
Nah. I gotta go and feed Hina.

153
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:50,067
[SETA]
Ooh, are those illegal drugs--

154
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,108
Antacids.

155

[SETA]
Huh.

156
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:56,900
Maybe Nitta really is
just your average guy.

Seta.

158
00:07:58,192 --> 00:07:59,858
How's your research
coming along?

159
00:07:59,942 --> 00:08:01,067
Oh, hey, Chief!

160
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,400
Uh, pretty good.

161
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,108
I've been getting some
awesome raw footage.

162
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:06,233
It just goes to show you

163
00:08:06,317 --> 00:08:08,483
the yakuza are still
alive and strong!

164
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:10,192
[CHIEF]
That so?

165
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,900
Can't wait to see it.

166
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:16,733
[SETA]
Now what do I do?

167
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:20,567
[SETA] The hole I was
in kept getting deeper.

168
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,358
[SETA]
With all due respect, Mr. Nitta,

169
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:25,067
can't you do something
more exciting? Please?

170
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,483
Didn't you tell me
I should be myself?

171
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:29,483
Besides, then the whole
thing would be fake.

172
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,733
You don't want that, do ya?

173
00:08:31,817 --> 00:08:34,108
But I thought you took out
that rival group by yourself.

174
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:35,608
Are you saying
that didn't happen?

175
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:37,567
[NITTA]
Uh, well, it's complicated.

176
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,358
It happened, but--[gasps]

177
00:08:39,442 --> 00:08:41,108
Act like it, then!

178
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:42,650
I'm an honest journalist.

179
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:45,233
I can't believe I'm stooping
so low as to stage this thing!

180
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:46,567
Show me you're a thug!

181
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,775
What are you, drunk?

182
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:51,692
[SETA] Does this make you
want to fight me, huh?

183
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:53,567
[NITTA groans]
Lay off!

184
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:58,900
[SETA pants, chuckles]

185
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:01,108
[NITTA sighs]

186
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:02,650
[NITTA]
Where's your pride?

187
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:05,900
Don't give me that bull if you
want to be taken seriously.

188
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:09,900
You have a good job that's on
the level, so don't screw it up.

189
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:13,108
Gettin' involved in this stuff
will leave a permanent scar.

190
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,358
[SETA]
Dammit, Nitta.

191
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:20,025
Even the way you chew
people out is wholesome.

192
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:22,483
How normal can you be?!

193
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:29,983
[SETA]
I have no choice.

194
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:31,942
I've got to do it!

195
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:34,900
Dude, are you crazy?

196
00:09:34,983 --> 00:09:37,608
This isn't just staged,
it's downright fake!

197
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:39,400
And you call yourself
a journalist?

198
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:41,567
[SETA]
Shut up! I had to!

199
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,067
Why? [gasps]

200
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,733
Because this is my job and
I have a family to feed!

201
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:49,400
What would you do?

202
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:50,983
[NITTA]
Turn the game off, Hina.

203
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:52,608
[HINA]
Huh? Why?

204
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,400
Because that documentary
about me is starting.

205
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:57,358
I have a hunch it didn't
come out very good,

206
00:09:57,442 --> 00:09:59,608
but... let's watch it.

207
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:06,692
[SETA] Our subject arrives
in a jet-black luxury car.

208
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:11,025
They say he singlehandedly
destroyed a rival organization.

209
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:15,025
A tough-as-nails yakuza
right out of a mob movie.

210
00:10:15,108 --> 00:10:18,567
Just who is this
fearsome desperado?

211
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:21,275
[NITTA]
Money was the only reason.

212
00:10:21,358 --> 00:10:22,692
Women, huh?

213
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:24,192
Delicious.

214
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:25,567
[thud]

215
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,942
[NITTA] Who the hell do you
think I am, crap-stain?

216
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:30,150
[SABU sobs]
I'm sorry!

217
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:32,400
[SETA]
Money, women, violence.

218
00:10:32,483 --> 00:10:35,317
What kind of early life
must a person experience

219
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,608
to become such a degenerate?

220
00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:40,317
N lost his father
at a young age,

221
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,650
which left him to suffer
a troubled adolescence.

222
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:44,900
[MIKA]
Chasin' down delinquents,

223
00:10:44,983 --> 00:10:47,400
using 'em to practice
illegal karate moves.

224
00:10:47,483 --> 00:10:50,442
Turns out you can get suspended
from school for that, though.

225
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:54,108
[SETA] When his penchant for
fighting forced him out of town,

226
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:57,067
he moved to Tokyo and
joined the yakuza.

227
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,608
Despite everything,
he says all he really wanted

228
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,983
was a place to call home.

229
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:05,025
But once N became a hired
gun for the organization,

230
00:11:05,108 --> 00:11:07,733
he lost all faith in humanity.

231
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:10,275
[BABA]
You're a real bigshot now, eh?

232
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:14,317
[NITTA]
He's a hopeless dumbass.

233
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:19,442
[NITTA] Then the whole thing
would be fake. Don't want that.

234
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:22,358
[SETA] And so, N emerged as
one of the most feared yakuza

235
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:24,692
of modern times--
nothing like the gentle,

236
00:11:24,775 --> 00:11:28,317
honor-bound yakuza who
once roamed the streets.

237
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,608
His lack of humanity was
reflected in his personal life.

238
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,317
One of his many female
conquests had a child,

239
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,067
who is now in N's care.

240
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,025
And just when we thought
he had a shred of decency...

241
00:11:40,108 --> 00:11:41,650
[NITTA]
This isn't my daughter.

242
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:43,983
[HINA]
I did my best to follow orders.

243
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:46,442
[SETA] In fact,
the girl's leg was broken.

244
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:50,192
When asked why, she said it had
happened for no apparent reason.

245
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:52,567
Hearing her insist
that she's N's daughter,

246
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,108
followed by N's
vehement denial of such,

247
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:57,442
was heartbreaking
to say the least.

248
00:11:57,525 --> 00:12:00,192
To N, everyone around
him is either an enemy

249
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:02,317
or someone he can exploit.

250
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,983
Seeing this, we asked him
a hard-hitting question.

251
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:08,608
At this rate, you must not
have a friend in the world.

252
00:12:08,692 --> 00:12:10,983
How do you feel about that?

253
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:13,108
[NITTA]
I'm a killing machine.

254
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,733
[SETA] After we'd
concluded our research

255
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,650
and paid our subject
for the interview,

256
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:19,192
N calmly turned to us and said:

257
00:12:19,275 --> 00:12:20,650
[NITTA]
What are you, drunk?

258
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:23,775
[SETA] We were rendered
speechless. Then, he continued:

259
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:25,358
[NITTA]
Don't give me that bull.

260
00:12:25,442 --> 00:12:28,067
Gettin' involved in this
will leave a permanent scar.

261
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,567
[SETA] We weren't quite sure
what he was referring to,

262
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,108
but his tone was
definitely threatening.

263
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:35,692
We had to offer him ten
times the original price

264
00:12:35,775 --> 00:12:37,775
before he was satisfied.

265
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:41,650
Then, with a menacing grin,
he vanished into the city.

266
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:43,567
N can never turn back.

267
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,442
His fate is to keep
running forward,

268
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:47,067
into the greed-soaked night,

269
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,900
until his many crimes
catch up to him.

270
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,192
Who was that guy?

271
00:12:58,275 --> 00:13:00,942
[NITTA] Damn it! Whole
thing came out terrible!

272
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:03,858
[BABA] There's the
"fearsome desperado."

273
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:05,942
Sorry I'm such a dumbass.

274
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:07,025
Look, sir.

275
00:13:07,108 --> 00:13:09,483
The old man was furious
when he saw it.

276
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:12,108
He wanted to know why you said
Hina wasn't your daughter.

277
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:15,025
Come on, that's the way the
TV station cut it together.

278
00:13:15,108 --> 00:13:16,692
All that stuff was fake!

279
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:18,358
--[BABA] What are you, drunk?
--Huh?

280
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:20,733
Yeah, don't give us that bull.

281
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,317
[NITTA cries]

282
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,108
N can never turn back.

283
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:31,900
Because, as we know, his fate
is to keep running forward,

284
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:34,608
into the greed-soaked
night, until...

285
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:37,733
[BABA, NAITO] ...his many
crimes catch up to him.

286
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,733
You recorded and memorized it?

287
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:41,900
Guess we both did.

288
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:43,650
They think I'm not tough.

289
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:45,900
[NITTA]
Hey, Hina!

290
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:47,525
You've been playin' way
too many video games!

291
00:13:47,608 --> 00:13:49,025
Did you do your homework?

292
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:51,317
[HINA]
I'm a killing machine.

293
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:56,067
{\an8}[SETA] The yakuza are
still alive and strong!

294
00:13:57,733 --> 00:13:59,525
[doorbell rings]

295
00:13:59,608 --> 00:14:01,525
Thanks for letting me stay here!

296
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:04,650
Sure.

297
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:08,525
[NITTA sighs]

298
00:14:08,608 --> 00:14:09,942
[NITTA] Thought I'd
have a break from kids

299
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:12,317
while Hina's off
taking skiing lessons,

300
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,150
but here I am babysitting again.

301
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:15,983
[NITTA]
Hey, Anzu.

302
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:17,317
Huh?

303
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,775
Didn't you want to go
with your new mom and pop

304
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,150
on their hot springs vacation?

305
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:23,275
They said they hadn't been
able to go for a long time,

306
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:24,900
so I gave them some space.

307
00:14:24,983 --> 00:14:26,067
[NITTA]
Hm?

308
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,275
They'll be way more
relaxed that way.

309
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,567
How much would it cost me
to trade Hina for you?

310
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,942
[ANZU]
Huh?

311
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:39,108
[ANZU]
I'll take those.

312
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:40,567
Oh, great, thanks.

00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,900
[ANZU giggles] No problem,
I'm used to carrying dishes!

314
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:47,358
[gasps]

315
00:14:47,442 --> 00:14:49,317
[ANZU]
Thanks for cooking!

316
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,775
Let me clean up the kitchen.

317
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:52,233
You sure you can?

318
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:53,317
[ANZU]
Yup!

319
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,442
I've gotten pretty
good at cleaning!

320
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:08,025
[NITTA]
Taking care of her is a breeze.

321
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:11,067
So what do I feel
so uneasy about?

322
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:15,483
[ANZU gasps]

323
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,317
I know all kinds of
household tricks.

324
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,150
[ANZU]
Wow, so cool!

325
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:22,817
Teach me more!

326
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,233
It's your day off, don't
you wanna go outside?

327
00:15:25,317 --> 00:15:26,817
[ANZU]
Mm-mm!

328
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,108
Let's think of a way to surprise
Mom and Pop when they get back!

329
00:15:30,192 --> 00:15:31,233
[ANZU giggles]

330
00:15:31,317 --> 00:15:32,900
[NITTA]
Sweet kid.

331
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,733
[giggles] This is great!

332
00:15:36,817 --> 00:15:37,858
[NITTA]
Mm-hmm.

333
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:42,817
[gasps] You're so good!

334
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,567
[NITTA] They're like
apples and rotten oranges.

335
00:15:48,358 --> 00:15:50,692
You chop lettuce like a robot.

336
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:56,025
[ANZU laughing]

337
00:15:56,108 --> 00:15:57,442
[NITTA]
Hmm...

338
00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:59,983
This show's stupid.

339
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:02,192
[NITTA]
There's no contest.

340
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:08,733
Nitta. Can I help
you with anything?

341
00:16:08,817 --> 00:16:10,525
Hey, you don't have
to work so hard.

342
00:16:10,608 --> 00:16:11,942
You're here as a guest, Anzu.

343
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:14,025
Yeah, but you're the host!

344
00:16:14,108 --> 00:16:15,775
It's good manners.

345
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:17,025
[NITTA sighs]

346
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:20,900
We should all help each other.

347
00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:22,650
[NITTA]
Hmm...

348
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,275
[gasps]

349
00:16:32,608 --> 00:16:34,108
That's weird.

350
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:36,775
[screams]

351
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:39,817
[NITTA] I hate those
old coots from Rairaiken!

352
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,608
Why am I stuck with Hina
when they have Anzu?

353
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:43,858
It's not fair!

354
00:16:43,942 --> 00:16:46,233
For someone like me,
she's the perfect child!

355
00:16:46,317 --> 00:16:47,525
[NITTA groans]

356
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:49,525
[NITTA]
Wait, that can't be right.

357
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:53,358
[NITTA] Anzu was a little
terror when I first met her.

358
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:56,817
She used to be stubborn,
rude, and even violent.

359
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,775
I should help her
remember her old ways.

360
00:16:59,858 --> 00:17:04,233
[NITTA laughing]

361
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:05,733
[NITTA]
Let's go have fun, Anzu.

362
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,150
Huh?

363
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:09,108
I thought you were gonna
teach me some more.

364
00:17:09,192 --> 00:17:11,400
[NITTA] Eh, you're only
here for a couple of days.

365
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:12,275
But, I--

366
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:13,817
Come on, you're still young.

367
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,150
Enjoy your day off.

368
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:18,275
What should we do?

369
00:17:18,358 --> 00:17:21,733
[gasps] I know how to
make cat's cradles.

370
00:17:21,817 --> 00:17:23,733
[laughs] That stuff's pointless.

371
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:25,608
What are you, 85?

372
00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:29,858
[NITTA]
All right, I'm gonna show you

373
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:32,358
how to spend leisure time.

374
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:35,858
At first, Anzu and Hina
were basically the same kid.

375
00:17:35,942 --> 00:17:39,067
Their environments are what
made 'em turn out differently.

376
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:41,525
[NITTA]
After she starts letting loose

377
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:43,192
and getting what
she wants, like Hina,

378
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:46,150
she'll go back to being
a selfish little brat.

379
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,942
This'll teach those
restaurant owners

380
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,983
how hard parenting
can really be!

381
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:51,192
[ANZU]
Wait!

382
00:17:51,275 --> 00:17:53,567
We don't have to do
that if it costs money!

383
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,400
[NITTA]
Man, she's unreal.

384
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:56,400
It's okay.

385
00:17:56,483 --> 00:17:57,858
You're supposed to
reward yourself

386
00:17:57,942 --> 00:18:00,775
when it's your day off, Anzu.

387
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:01,942
[gasps]

388
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:03,483
After all, your parents
are spending money

389
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:05,108
on their vacation, too.

390
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:07,150
[NITTA] You won't have a
selfless bone in your body

391
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:08,650
when I'm done with you.

392
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:10,525
Going to the hot
springs costs money?

393
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:12,108
Sure it does.

394
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:16,192
And the more money ya spend,
the more fun your life can be.

395
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:18,192
[gasps]

396
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:20,900
[ANZU giggles]

397
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:22,775
[ANZU]
Wow, look at all the fish!

398
00:18:22,858 --> 00:18:28,150
[ANZU giggling]

399
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,983
Come on, Nitta!

400
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,817
Let's look over here!

401
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,942
All right, I'm goin'!

402
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:36,858
--[gasps] Hey!
--[ANZU gasps]

403
00:18:36,942 --> 00:18:40,150
[NITTA] That was close!
I almost let my guard down!

404
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:41,358
[ANZU]
Uh?

405
00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:46,900
[ANZU giggles]

406
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:49,358
He got water everywhere!

407
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:50,983
[NITTA]
Be strong, Nitta!

408
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:52,525
This is all an act!

409
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:55,733
It's a survival strategy she
learned when she was homeless!

410
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,317
[ANZU]
Yay! Lookie!

411
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,233
[laughing]

412
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:02,733
[NITTA]
Remember.

413
00:19:02,817 --> 00:19:05,858
Kids are driven by nothing
but their own selfish desires.

414
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:10,233
They only exist to annoy you and
waste every last yen you have.

415
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:13,483
--No!
--[ANZU gasps]

416
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,483
[ANZU] Hey, Nitta!
Let's ride this one next!

417
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:19,192
Hurry, come on!

418
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:21,608
[NITTA]
Here goes.

419
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:24,608
I've made it this far,
now I can go in for the kill!

420
00:19:24,692 --> 00:19:26,650
Seems like you're
having a good day.

421
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:27,900
[ANZU]
Mm-hmm.

422
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:30,358
After this, we can ride
whatever you like, okay?

423
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:33,608
Nah, I'm happy with
anything you wanna do.

424
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:35,275
This is your day, remember?

425
00:19:35,358 --> 00:19:38,233
So you might as well be
as greedy as possible!

426
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:40,525
--[ANZU] That's not right.
--Huh?

427
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:42,733
If today's supposed
to be for fun,

428
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:44,733
then we should both enjoy it!

429
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:48,525
Well... it's just... [gasps]

430
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:51,192
There's nothing I'd rather do
today than hang out with you!

431
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:52,358
[giggles]

432
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:55,692
[NITTA chuckles]

Come with us.

[ANZU ANGELS giggling]

437
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:22,733
What've I been doing
with my life till now?

438
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:24,233
[HINA DEMONS]
Join us, Nitta...

439
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:28,400
[NITTA] I should just let go
and surrender to this dream.

440
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:34,567
[echoing]
Forever... Forever... Forever...

--Here, Nitta!

You like it?

446
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:02,067
[NITTA]
Mm. Yeah. It's good.

447
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:06,025
[BOTH laughing]

448

[ANZU giggling]

449
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:18,525
[NITTA] This moment...
is a father's perfect world.

450
00:21:21,275 --> 00:21:22,942
[NITTA]
So, new day!

451
00:21:23,025 --> 00:21:24,067
Whaddaya wanna do?

452
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,567
[ANZU]
Hm?

453
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,067
Well, my mom and pop come
back today, so I'm going home.

454
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,192
[NITTA]
Oh, yeah.

455
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:33,567
Bye, Nitta!

456
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,942
See ya.

457
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:42,817
[NITTA] Oh, man, I got so caught
up in the miracle of parenthood,

458
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,025
I completely forgot!

459
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:47,733
It's back to reality today!

460
00:21:47,817 --> 00:21:48,817

D'you miss me?

Hey. It's Nitta.

464
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:57,400
[MATSUTANI] This is Matsutani,
from Hina's school.

465

[clears throat] Uh...

Hm?

00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,525
[MATSUTANI] As you know,
we're scheduled to return

468
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:05,192
from our class skiing
trip today, and...

469
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:08,192
Well, there's no easy
way to say this, but...

470
00:22:08,275 --> 00:22:10,025
[NITTA]
Hm?

471
00:22:10,108 --> 00:22:13,442
