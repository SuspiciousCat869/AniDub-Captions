But I can move
more snow this way.

[KENGO]
Well, you're not wrong.

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,650
I can't believe we're
lost in the mountains

9
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,483
and we have to build
an igloo to survive.

This is a serious situation.

being stuck out here?

Huh?

Oh, really?

[HITOMI]
Let's wait here for help.

28
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:42,733
We should try to conserve
as much energy as possible.

29
00:02:42,817 --> 00:02:45,400
It'll be hard, but we'll
get through this together!

Mm.

Mishima next to each other,

Maybe things aren't that bad.

up here at night!

Feed me.

It's all my fault.
I'm sorry I got carried away.

I don't understand.

40
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,400
What happens if no one
comes to rescue us?

41
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:11,358
We die.

That's our Hina.

Brings the whole room down
and then just leaves.

This is my fault, Takashi.

48

We only got into this mess

49
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:31,942
because I said I
knew a shortcut.

50

But we all went that way.

Don't blame yourself.

He's right.

to use your powers!

You okay?

168
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,775

Huh?

to take a strange turn.

wooden dolls again.

changed. The girl's disturbed.

Oh, okay.

Anyway, my band, Central Park's

287
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,983
working on a new
genre called Rockusion

288

that combines rock
with stage magic.

We went to the U.S. to
learn how to do magic,

but all the tricks we saw there
were the cheap, fake kind.

your video online and said,

"This is it!"

if you can teach me

magic you do,

for my new style!

going to Japan with him,

but maybe I shouldn't be
talking to him at all!

screws with your brain.

to quit the band,

You're not going anywhere.

325
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,233
Lady Mao. We've come
to escort you home.

00:16:53,317 --> 00:16:55,108
Uh--oh, okay.

327
00:16:55,192 --> 00:16:57,025
But first, I need
to talk to this guy

328
00:16:57,108 --> 00:16:58,525
about something really quick.

329
00:16:58,608 --> 00:16:59,733
You mustn't.

330
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:01,275
Whoa. What's up?

331
00:17:01,358 --> 00:17:05,525
[MAO] No. I finally got a lead
on Hina after all this time.

332
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,442
If I let Shinyhead take me back,

333
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:09,900
then I may never
get another chance!

334
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:13,317
Lady Mao!

335
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,733

one of our own!

00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:31,108
We didn't want to fight
with you, Lady Mao,

344
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:32,983
but you've left us
with no choice!

345
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:35,192
[MAO] There's only
one way out of this.

346
00:17:35,275 --> 00:17:37,108
I'll just have to use my
Superhuman Martial Arts

347
00:17:37,192 --> 00:17:38,275
against them!

Care to surrender?

Huh?

Luckily we all use the

Uh-oh. That's a crowd!

[MAO] If I blow all

when Hina used her magic!

It's probably not a good idea

00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:08,192
for me to throw the old man.

[MONK MASTER]
Explain yourself, young lady.

380
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:13,983
This guy's taking me to Japan.

381
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:16,233
Japan? Nonsense!

382
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:18,400
Master was the one who
discovered your talent

383
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:20,275
and brought you to live here!

384
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:23,067
If he hadn't pulled strings
to raise your status,

385
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,733
you'd still be homeless!

386
00:19:24,817 --> 00:19:27,108
But my skills have brought
you more students.

387
00:19:27,192 --> 00:19:30,233
I'm sure you're more than happy
to have their tuition money.

388
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:32,567
So I think that means
I've repaid my debt.

389
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,817
[BOTH]
Why you!

390

You two. Wait.

00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:36,858
[MONK A, MONK B]
But!

392
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:40,442
We appeared on TV.

393
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:42,942
Now we have ten
branches nationwide.

394
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:45,275
That was all thanks to you.

395
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:51,775
Therefore, if you can pass the
Superhuman Martial Arts trial,

396
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,775
I will allow you to leave us.

No! Not that!

your abilities

But when you are faced with
an enemy like this one,

414
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,942
Gaika-ken is the
only real option.

415
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,025
I suggest you train in
that for a little while

416
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:39,983
and then go to Japan.
