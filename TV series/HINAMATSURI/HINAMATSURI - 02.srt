1
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,875
[ANZU]
Owwie!

2
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:32,541
Jeez, dropping people on the
ground is a serious design flaw!

3
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,166
[BIKER]
Whoa, you got a death wish?

4
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,041
Move outta the street
before you get killed!

5
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,958
And put some
damn clothes on, too!

6
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,625
Hey! Are you listenin' to me?

7
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:44,875
Turn off that stupid thing.

8
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:45,958
It's way too loud.

9
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,000
[BIKER]
That's it, now you've done it!

10
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,333
Don't talk about
my baby that way!

11
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:55,000
[BIKERS] Owwie! Owwie! Owwie!
Owwie! Owwie! Owwie! Owwie!

12
00:00:55,083 --> 00:01:01,333
Owwie! Owwie! Owwie!
Owwie! Owwie! Owwie.

13
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:04,000
[ANZU] I'm gonna
borrow these for a while.

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,708
[ANZU]
You can't hide from me, Hina.

15
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,000
[BIKER]
Owwie.

16
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,041
[SABU]
Did you hear the news, Boss?

17
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,750
Jashinryuu got their asses
handed to 'em last night!

18
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,208
I'm guessing a war broke
out between the scrubs?

19
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,750
No, and you're never gonna
believe what did happen.

20
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:54,916
[NITTA]
Hmm?

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,458
Some little girl
beat 'em all by herself.

22
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,958
I know, I thought it was a joke!

23
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,000
[NITTA] That sounds like
something she could do...

24
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,708
[NITTA]
...but I was with her all day.

25
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,208
[NITTA]
Hmph.

26
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,750
Nah, one telekinetic
kid makes sense.

27
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:15,916
But two?

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,583
Now that's bordering
on ridiculous.

29
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,541
You think she's...?

30
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,041
Maybe.

31
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,208
[COOK]
Wait, Miss! You got money?

32
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,625
Money? What for?

33
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,250
[NITTA groans]
That's not good!

34
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,208
You're seriously
not gonna pay, huh?

35
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm way too busy to deal
with a dine-and-dash, kid!

36
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,666
I don't have to
take this from you.

37
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,833
Hang on.

38
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,708
Please, let me take care of it.

39
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,166
Wow. That's nice.

40
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,166
Uh. Sure, okay.

41
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:04,958
[COOK]
Thanks.

42
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,583
What'd you pay that
girl's bill for, Boss?

43
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,166
I wouldn't have been
able to enjoy my ramen

44
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,208
with her causing
a big scene like that.

45
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:14,875
True.

46
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,625
[COOK]
Order up!

47
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,166
[SABU]
Aw yeah, come to Papa!

48
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:20,833
Hey.

49
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:21,916
Yes?

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
[NITTA]
You can have mine.

51
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,041
Wait, what?

52
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,708
[NITTA] Crap. I didn't think
this through all the way!

53
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,625
[GANG MEMBER A]
There she is! Get her!

54
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,416
[GANG MEMBER A]
We've been lookin' for you!

55
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,875
You pissed off the wrong
bikers last night, half-pint!

56
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,250
Yeah, and that's the
president's jacket!

57
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,500
So?

58
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,125
Give it back, right now!

59
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,250
[GANG MEMBER A]
Owwie!

60
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,041
[GANG MEMBER C]
Owwie!

61
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,208
[GANG MEMBER B]
Owwie!

62
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,083
[GANG MEMBER D]
Owwie!

63
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,208
[GANG MEMBER A, C]
Owwie!

64
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,791
Owwie!

65
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:08,791
[ANZU]
Hey.

66
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:09,958
[gasps]

67
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,375
Do you know someone named Hina?

68
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,833
[GANG MEMBER A]
Hina? Hell no!

69
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,541
She's some kinda witch!

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,333
Uh... Nitta. Welcome home.

71
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:30,541
[NITTA] Why am I surrounded
by creepy horror movie kids?

72
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,500
What did I do to deserve this?

73
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,708
Hey, I'm hungry. What's for--

74
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,750
Why are you smothering my face?

75
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,250
[NITTA]
I'm just mad you exist.

76
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,208
[SHOP CLERK]
Come back!

77
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,916
You really think
yelling "come back"

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,125
is gonna make me come back?

79
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,708
[SHOP CLERK pants]

80
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,625
She's way too fast!

81
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,833
[NITTA]
Dine-and-dash and shoplifting?

82
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,916
She's caused a lot of
trouble these past few days.

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,583
I know, that's why
I was hoping you could talk

84
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,541
to the family about her.

85
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,750
She's so quick to hide
we can't catch her.

86
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:05,208
[NITTA] Yeah. We need
to nip this one in the bud.

87
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,500
Tell the local bums

88
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,541
there's a reward for
helping us find this girl.

89
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,791
Got it.

90
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,416
[NITTA] It might take
one super-powered kid

91
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,166
to find another.

92
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,750
What if Hina had crash-landed
in the middle of the city,

93
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,291
instead of my apartment?

94
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,083
Feed me!

95
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,541
Sabu.

96
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,541
[SABU]
Hmm?

97
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,875
No need to
freak out or anything,

98
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,041
but I just realized
I'm a national hero.

99
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,791
You are?

100
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,041
[ANZU]
What to do.

101
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,208
Maybe I should hit up

102
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,500
one of those
"convenience store" places.

103
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,125
Gotta get my next meal
from somewhere.

104
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,041
Oh!

105
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,083
That's right!

106
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,291
I came here to look for Hina!

107
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,666
But right now,

108
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,416
all I'm trying to
do is stay alive.

109
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,500
[SABU]
Hey, Boss?

110
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,791
We found her.

111
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:01,916
Roger that.

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,333
I'll go talk to her.

113
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,250
You and the guys can fall back.

114
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,666
[NITTA]
Hina, you're coming with me.

115
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,666
[HINA]
Hmm?

116
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,708
Nice work, Yassan.

117
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,500
Here's your pay.

118
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,875
My god.

119
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,541
What kind of shady business
have I got myself into?

120
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,125
I just hand-delivered
a poor defenseless urchin girl

121
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,041
to a group of street thugs.

122
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,291
Wow, dude.

123
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,333
Sounds pretty dark
when you put it like that.

124
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:26,875
That's enough!

125
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,416
It's time to actually find her!

126
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,000
No matter how hungry I am,

127
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,500
I'll get my hands on that girl
if it takes me the whole day!

128
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,916
Hi, Anzu.

129
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,083
Huh? I was prepared to
search the whole city for you,

130
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,166
and you just walk
right up to me?

131
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,458
Eh, oh well.

132
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:47,333
Hina!

133
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,958
Get ready for a butt-kicking!

134
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:49,750
[NITTA groans]

135
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:50,750
How come?

136
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:51,958
[ANZU]
Orders from the top.

137
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,000
I have to dispose of you.

138
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,666
Now time to bring on the pain.

139
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,458
[NITTA]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

140
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,625
Wait a sec!

141
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,625
Don't do it here,
you'll make a huge mess!

142
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,333
I've got a much better idea,
if you just hear me out!

143
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,791
[ANZU]
Step aside.

144
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,375
No, you have to listen,
or Hina's gonna run away!

145
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,375
Nuh-uh.

146
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,333
[NITTA]
Want some salmon roe?

147
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,791
I'll totally run.

148
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,083
All right, fine.
What's your brilliant idea?

149
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,500
[ANZU]
The "made you look" game?

150
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,375
[NITTA]
You play rock-paper-scissors.

151
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,541
Then whoever wins has to try
and get the other person

152
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,583
to turn their head
in a certain direction.

153
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,833
If they look,
they lose the game.

154
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,083
But if they keep their eyes
forward for ten seconds,

155
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,000
you play again.

156
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,083
It seems kinda stupid,

157
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,708
but it might be a better test
of strength than fighting.

158
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:38,750
You're on.

159
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,958
Whatever it takes
to defeat Hina.

160
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:41,958
Ow.

161
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:42,833
[NITTA]
Salmon roe.

162
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,791
I will end you.

163
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,583
You're gonna run away

164
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,208
with your tail between
your legs, aren't you?

165
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,083
I eat loser kids like
you for breakfast.

166
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,375
[ANZU] Oh, that's it,
you are dead meat!

167
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,416
Right!

168
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,166
It's Hina versus Anzu!

169
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,208
"Made you look" game!

170
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,583
Begin!

171
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,458
Heh! I've been looking
forward to fighting you

172
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,000
for a long time, Hina.

173
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,583
[ANZU]
Let's do this!

174
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,208
Rock, paper, scissors!

175
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,541
Look at the ground!

176
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,041
That's ten!

177
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,416
Ugh. You're pretty good.

178
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,708
[NITTA]
Okay, let's do round two.

179
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,791
[HINA, ANZU]
Rock, paper, scissors.

180
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,041
Look up!

181
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,083
[roars]

182
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,458
[NITTA]
Stop!

183
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,208
[NITTA laughs]

184
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,041
Ow, my sides!

185
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,083
[ANZU]
She won't budge!

186
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,500
But I'm using
every bit of my power!

187
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,833
[NITTA]
Time for round three, ladies!

188
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,375
[ANZU, HINA]
Rock, paper, scissors!

189
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,250
Look to your right.

190
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,708
My neck! It's broken!

191
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,916
[NITTA]
So, uh, that's game.

192
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,666
Will you leave her alone now?

193
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,333
[ANZU]
Hina.

194
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,166
I had no idea
you were that strong.

195
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,666
Your power really is terrifying.

196
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,541
Wow. You think so?

197
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,583
Damn.

198
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,208
You put up a
decent fight, though.

199
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,666
[ANZU] Would you
hold still for a second?

200
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,791
Ow!

201
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,750
[ANZU] I'm just gonna
tell them you're dead.

202
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,916
They'll probably buy it if
I show them some of your hair.

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,625
[HINA]
Anzu.

204
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,000
Do you wanna hang out
before you go home?

205
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,500
Huh?!

206
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,333
Why would I do that?

207
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,333
I came to fight you.

208
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,708
[HINA]
You know.

209
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,208
I've learned lots of new
things since I've been here.

210
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,375
[gasps]

211
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,083
Hina.

212
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,916
You've changed, huh?

213
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,041
Not too long ago, you didn't
even know how to talk!

214
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,541
[NITTA sighs]

215
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,875
This is my life now.

216
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,541
Who would've thought?

217
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,083
[ANZU]
I should head home.

218
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:50,916
[NITTA]
Take care.

219
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,250
[HINA]
Anzu.

220
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,708
I'll see you later.

221
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,291
You dummy.

222
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,291
You're supposed
to be dead, remember?

223
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,000
See you never.

224
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,125
Huh?! Hey, what gives?

225
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,000
It's busted.

226
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,166
So I don't have a way home?

227
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,750
I'm stuck here?

228
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:24,833
What should I do?

229
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,125
I can't go back to Hina's.

230
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:37,000
[ANZU sobs]

231
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,000
So, Utako, baby.

232
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,375
Let's go out sometime.

233
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,250
I know this great French place.

234
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,250
What? Are you serious?

235
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,375
Course I am.

236
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,833
I would never joke about us.

237
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,333
Aren't you booked?

238
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,333
I'd like to order the sweetest
cocktail on the menu, please.

239
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,583
[NITTA]
Ladies.

240
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,458
You're breaking my heart!

241
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,625
You used to try to get
my business all the time,

242
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,750
but I don't hear
from you anymore!

243
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,416
It's not just you, either.

244
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,291
My dating life's been
oddly quiet lately.

245
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,125
I mean...

246
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,000
Well...

247
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,208
Hmm?

248
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,750
There's a rumor going around.

249
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,291
Word has it,

250
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,083
you're trying to spend more
quality time with your daughter.

251
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,791
So you've sworn off
philandering forever!

252
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,375
Aww!

253
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,541
[NITTA]
What?

254
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,625
[shrieks]

255
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,125
[WOMAN A] Wow, and you
used to be such a player!

256
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,708
[WOMAN B]
They say there's no greater love

257
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,333
than father and daughter!

258
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,750
[WOMAN A] Yeah, I heard you
dropped a million spoiling her

259
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,708
at the department store
the other day, too!

260

[WOMAN B]
Daddy's little princess!

Welcome home, Nitta.

262
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,208
[NITTA]
It's because of her.

263
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,916
Is it almost dinner?

264
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,541
[NITTA]
This entire thing is her fault.

265
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,125
Her fault!

266
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,166
Here.

267
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,375
[gasps]

268
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,041
What is this?

269
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,958
[HINA]
It's not too bad.

270
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:20,708
[NITTA]
That's it!

271
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,583
I've made up my mind!

272
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,208
I won't let her ruin my life!

273
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:34,250
[HINA] I am gonna go out
there and philander my ass off!

274
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,041
Be home in a bit.

275
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,583
But it's nighttime.

276
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,291
Exactly.

277
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
[laughs]

278
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,708
All right, girls!

279
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,416
Time to drink
and party all night!

280
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,125
Ooh! Nitta!

281
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,625
Again?

282
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,458
[WOMAN B]
Oh my, you're such a gentleman!

283
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,458
[HINA]
Again.

284
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,625
[WOMAN B]
I can't believe you finally

285
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,333
asked me on a date, Nitta!

286
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,875
[NITTA laughs]
I'mma show you a good time!

287
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:12,083
I'm heading out.

288
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,208
[approaching footsteps]

289
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,083
Whoa.

290
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,166
What's wrong, kid?

291
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,583
I'll come with you.

00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,583
Say what?

293
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,333
You've been going
out every night.

294
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,041
Take me, too.

295
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:28,000
[NITTA screams]

296
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,625
Damn. Brat's relentless.

297
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,125
[HITOMI]
You okay, Hina?

298
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,291
Nitta's acting funny lately.

299
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,333
By "Nitta,"
you mean your dad, right?

300
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,000
He's always leaving
me home by myself.

301
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,541
And he only lets me eat
canned mackerel for dinner.

302
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,250
Um. I'm sorry, Hina.

303
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,666
I wasn't trying to pry
into your home life!

304
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,208
I know!

305
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,375
[HITOMI]
You want to stalk your dad?

306
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,333
[HINA]
Yeah.

307
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,166
But why do you need me?

308
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,375
There's always more
than one person

309
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,708
when they do this on TV.

310
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:23,791
And that's not all.

311
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,375
This whole town
is covered with traps.

312
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,083
[HITOMI]
He's walking away!

313
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,833
Where'd she go?

314
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,458
[HINA] Now I see what
you mean by traps!

315
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,083
Looks like we lost him.

316
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,666
[HINA] I have a pretty good
guess where he's headed.

317
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,291
[HINA]
Utako.

318
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,583
Utako?

319
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:50,000
[HITOMI] The sign outside
says they're closed.

320
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,375
I'll go find her.

321
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,916
You stay here, Hitomi.

322
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Huh? Hina, wait!

323
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,500
[TANAKA]
Utako! I'm ready to get drunk!

324
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,958
[laughs] I only had
five or six on the way!

325
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,583
[HITOMI]
Um, sorry, sir!

326
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,083
The bar's not open yet, so--

327
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,041
[TANAKA]
Who are you?

328
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,000
Did Utako quit?

329
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,541
You're young for a bartender!

330
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,666
Well, long as I get my drinks!

331
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,208
Um. I'm not a...

332
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,666
--Highball.
--But I can't--

333
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,458
What, you don't know
how to make a highball?

334
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,875
Well...

335
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,041
Don't worry, your ol' pal
Tanaka's here to teach ya!

336
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,625
But I... Okay.

337
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,708
[HINA]
So good.

338
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,916
[UTAKO]
Well, hello, Miss Hina!

339
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,416
[HINA]
Oh, Utako.

340
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,333
Why are you by yourself?

341
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,625
Here I am, Utako.

342
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,291
Did you miss me?

343
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:42,708
One highball.

344
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:43,875
Good job!

345
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,916
You're better than most
bartenders my age!

346
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,375
Uh, am I in the right place?

347
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,541
Nitta! Come on over here, buddy!

348
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,541
Oh, you're Hina's father, right?

349
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,666
Thank goodness!

350
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,125
I'm not anybody's father!
Got that?

351
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,666
[HITOMI]
Yikes! I'm sorry!

352
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,958
So whatcha drinkin'?

353
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,541
'Cause I'm buyin'!

354
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,958
[NITTA] You must've won at the
horse races today, eh, Tanaka?

355
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,250
Yup, practically
robbed the place.

356
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,916
[NITTA]
All right. Martini, please.

357
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,625
[HITOMI]
Oh, no.

358
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,666
[UTAKO] Well, what do you
think would be fair, Hina?

359
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,875
[HINA]
He should be punished.

360
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,083
He's always out
having fun without me.

361
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,083
And I bet he's not eating
canned fish for supper.

362
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,000
[UTAKO] So you wish Nitta had
more time to play with you, huh?

363
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,708
[HINA]
Yeah.

364
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,333
If you want him
to change his ways,

365
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,250
you should say so.

366
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,083
[HINA]
You think he'll understand?

367
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,250
He'll never understand
if you don't.

368
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,041
Nitta's a strange guy.

369
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,833
He's always trying to get me
to go to dinner with him.

370
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,708
And sometimes, his enthusiasm
alone is almost enough

371
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:46,541
to make me give in.

372
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,625
[HINA]
I get it.

373
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,250
So he's trying hard, too.

374
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,958
[UTAKO chuckles]
Anyway, we should head back.

375
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,916
[NITTA]
I'm just trying so hard.

376
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,375
You know what I mean, Tanaka?

377
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,791
How come I can't catch a break?

378
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,333
I know what you mean.

379
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,000
[UTAKO]
Huh? We're open?

380
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,166
What can I get
started for you two?

381
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,291
A kid?

382
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,083
Utako!

383
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,666
This one's got potential!

384
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,791
She's been soaking up everything
I teach her like a sponge!

385
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,208
One daiquiri.

386
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,791
I tell you, sweetheart,
she was born to be a bartender!

387
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,083
She'll be runnin'
this place in ten years!

388
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,666
Interesting.

389
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,333
[HITOMI]
There goes my life.

390
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,583
[HINA]
Hey, Nitta.

391
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,250
Oh. Hello there, Hina.

392
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,750
What're you up to, Hina?

393
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:26,750
[HINA]
There's something important

394
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,750
I've been meaning to tell you.

395
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,000
What is it?

396
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,833
Would you please...
take me with you...

397
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,541
...to the gentlemen's club?

398
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:40,750
What'd you say?

399
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,833
How about that, Nitta!

400
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,458
We've got the world's
youngest bartender

401
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,833
and the world's
youngest nightclubber!

402
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,333
Come on, where's the harm?

403
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,916
I dunno. Should we?

404
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,375
Oh hell yeah!

405
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,208
Everybody!

Get us a champagne tower!

00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,291
What? It's not a
wedding reception.

419
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,291
[WOMAN A] I'm sorry, miss. We
don't offer that service here.

420
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,833
Aww.

421
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:42,458
All you do is stack a bunch
of glasses in a pyramid, right?

422
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,500
[NITTA]
Don't bother.

423
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,375
Just leave the hard work to me.

424
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,875
Yeah, I'm gonna need a champagne
tower service delivered, please.

00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,791
And make it quick,
we're trying to party here!

All right, Hina.

429
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,791
Levitate that champagne
bottle, would ya?

430
00:20:58,875 --> 00:20:59,416
Huh?

431
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,041
Are you sure?

432
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,625
Why not?

433
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,041
It's just a magic trick!

[TANAKA luaghs]

Do you know what time it is?

00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,125
Where are you?

[HITOMI]
I'm uh...

Well, I'm at a gentlemen's club.

Oh, ha-ha, very funny.

Just get your butt home!

Be right there.

God.

00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,083
I feel like death.

That was, uh, like,
a one-time thing.
