I'd probably beat him up, too!

160
00:08:07,983 --> 00:08:09,692
[HITOMI]
That's cute.

161
00:08:09,775 --> 00:08:12,067
They have no idea what
the real world is like,

162
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,358
especially office
jobs like mine.

163
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:15,733
[SHIHO]
Mishima?

164
00:08:15,817 --> 00:08:18,067
Didn't I ask you to
photocopy these forms?

165
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:21,358
Oh! Right! Sorry.

166
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:23,483
[WOMAN C chuckles]
Slipping already.

167
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,192
Poor thing.

168
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,692
[HITOMI]
Here they are.

169
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:30,108
And these are for you.

170
00:08:30,192 --> 00:08:31,567
For me?

171
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,900
These are the snacks from
Okashi that are so popular.

172
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:37,567
I happened to pass by their
storefront the other day,

173
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,567
so I thought maybe we could
share them during our break.

174
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,817
[SHIHO]
Uh--

175
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,067
Oh, wow. Look!

176
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,025
You wanted those. Right, Shiho?

177
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,692
She's thoughtful!

178
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,983
"Happened" to pass by, huh?

179
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,567
[SHIHO]
I could use a little help here.

180
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,900
[HITOMI]
I took care of those files.

181
00:08:57,983 --> 00:08:59,192
[SHIHO]
Mm?

182
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:00,442
By the way,

183
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:02,733
I have a quick question
if you have some time.

184
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:06,483
[SHIHO] Let's go on break.
We can talk things out.

185
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:07,692
Uh--

186
00:09:11,608 --> 00:09:12,608
Now, then.

187
00:09:12,692 --> 00:09:14,733
I hear you work
quite a bit, Mishima.

188
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:15,650
Uh-huh.

189
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:17,150
[SHIHO]
Are you in debt or what?

190
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:19,275
Um, well...

191
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,942
You don't have to answer that.

192
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:22,650
My guess is you
answer to a pimp.

193
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:25,067
[HITOMI]
Why's that your first thought?

194
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,692
It's kinda rough here.

195
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,108
Most girls that come through
can't handle all the bullying,

196
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:31,067
so they never last very long.

197
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:35,108
[SHIHO] But you just might
be management material.

198
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:36,942
Keep working hard, kid.

199
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:37,817
Bye.

200
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,067
[HITOMI]
Miss Asagiri.

201
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,400
Um... you never
answered my question.

202
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,942
[HITOMI chuckles]

203
00:09:48,025 --> 00:09:51,483
Of course this is half price.
It's all leftover pieces.

204
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,692
[HITOMI]
What's up, Mom?

205
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:55,733
[HITOMI'S MOM] Where on
earth are you right now?

206
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:57,733
Oh, I decided I should
get my own place.

207
00:09:57,817 --> 00:09:59,067
[HITOMI'S MOM]
What?!

208
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,817
Listen, I'm really tired
from work. Goodnight, Mom.

209
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,358
[HITOMI'S MOM]
Wait, Hito--

210
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:09,150
[HITOMI] Just have to
hold out a bit longer...

211
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:15,400
[HITOMI panting]

212
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:16,608
[thud]

213
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:24,525
[HITOMI gasps]
Oh, no, I fell asleep!

214
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:27,275
And I didn't put the
food in the fridge!

215
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:29,067
My suit's wrinkled--[gasps]

216
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,442
I'm late to my next job!

217
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:34,983
Hey, wait.

218
00:10:36,025 --> 00:10:37,817
I'm crying.

219
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,442
Where did these tears come from?

220
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,108
[HITOMI]
I've had enough.

221
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:46,942
When am I gonna learn to say no?

222
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:48,442
I'm a failure.

223
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:50,358
[UTAKO]
Are you listening to me, Hitomi?

224
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,067
[gasps] Sorry, what?

225
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,442
We think you should throw
big a housewarming party!

226
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:58,442
I mean, I'm sure you're settled
into your new place by now.

227
00:10:58,525 --> 00:10:59,942
[HITOMI]
Not even close!

228
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:03,275
Besides, that'd totally be
an extra headache for me!

229
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:06,567
You always do your best for
us. Let's celebrate you.

230
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,858
Yeah, and you've got
plenty of room for guests!

231
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:12,775
[HITOMI]
One daiquiri.

232
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,150
[HITOMI]
I'm done!

233
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:18,275
I want to be a
normal girl again!

234
00:11:18,358 --> 00:11:19,983
I'm sorry, Mom!

235
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:22,442
It's okay that you
didn't believe me!

236
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:25,608
I need you. [gasps]

237
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:27,858
[HITOMI]
That's it!

238
00:11:27,942 --> 00:11:30,233
I should invite my mom
to the party, too!

239
00:11:30,317 --> 00:11:32,025
And then she'll see the
way I've been living

240
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,233
and force me to come back home!

241
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:38,650
I'm free! I'm finally
free from adulthood!

242
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:40,400
[MEN chattering]

243
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:41,567
She's really something!

244
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,817
So glad we found her.

245
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,983
[MAN D]
Same here.

246
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:46,358
[HITOMI'S MOM]
What in the world is this?

247
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:49,692
I can't believe she
invited her mother.

248
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,608
[UTAKO sighs]

249
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:53,733
That's it. My bar's toast.

250
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:56,858
It's not just that.
You'll probably get sued, too.

251
00:11:56,942 --> 00:11:57,900
Hi, Mom!

252
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,983
[MEN gasp]

253
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:02,067
Huh?

254
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,900
[MAN F]
Are you really Hitomi's mother?

255
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:05,233
[MAN C]
Let me give you my card.

256
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:07,817
[HITOMI'S MOM]
Um... Hold on.

257
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,900
[gasping]

258
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:10,733
[HITOMI'S MOM]
How does she know them?

259
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:13,233
Some of these are
huge companies!

260
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,567
[MAN F] Your daughter's a
very ambitious young lady.

261
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,192
You must be so proud of her!

262
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:20,275
I'm the head of human resources.

263
00:12:20,358 --> 00:12:22,525
I'd love to have
Hitomi work at my firm.

264
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:23,817
[HITOMI'S MOM]
Huh?

265
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,442
Since we know her,
she wouldn't need to apply.

266
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:28,650
She can start tomorrow.

267
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:30,900
That girl could be an
executive one day!

268
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,233
Uh--

269
00:12:32,317 --> 00:12:34,025
[HITOMI]
Now's the time, Mom.

270
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:37,025
Tell them that your daughter's
only a middle school student!

271
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:41,317
Say it! Say it! Say it!

272
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,983
Please take care of my daughter.

273
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:45,108
[HITOMI screams]

274
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:46,233
[HITOMI]
Sidebar, Mom!

275
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:47,942
Huh?

276
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:50,233
[HITOMI] Why didn't you
tell them the truth?

277
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:53,358
People don't make connections to
top companies every day, dear.

278
00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:54,775
[HITOMI gasps]

279
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,233
[HITOMI'S MOM] Besides,
this was your plan, wasn't it?

280
00:12:57,317 --> 00:12:58,567
Huh?

281
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,067
[HITOMI'S MOM]
Work as a bartender,

282
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,192
rub elbows with important people
from different industries,

283
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:05,775
and get yourself a great
job after a bidding war?

284
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:07,358
[HITOMI]
Uh...

285
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:10,150
Even though you're my daughter,
your drive kind of scares me.

286
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:11,317
[gasps]

287
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,442
One thing's clear, though.

288
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:16,775
After seeing your initiative,

289
00:13:16,858 --> 00:13:19,650
I can't stop you from
following your dreams.

290
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:21,525
I believe in you, dear.

291
00:13:21,608 --> 00:13:23,067
So do what you want.

292
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,108
[HITOMI]
Uh, I didn't plan for this.

293
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:27,608
Yeah!

294
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:29,358
You're the one we're
all here celebrating.

295
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:30,900
Why don't you lead
us in a toast?

296
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:33,942
Let's get this party rolling!

297
00:13:34,025 --> 00:13:36,317
Here. Go.

298
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,192
Drink up.

299
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,233
[HITOMI'S MOM, MEN]
Cheers!

[HITOMI'S MOM, MEN
laughing, chattering]

301
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:59,067
{\an8}Now that I look back,
what was I trying to accomplish?

302
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:03,525
[MR. HAYASHI]
Here you go.

303
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:05,108
Huh?

304
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:07,775
That's the payment for all the
work you've done in the shop.

305
00:14:07,858 --> 00:14:11,775
But... you let me stay here
and you cook for me.

306
00:14:11,858 --> 00:14:13,108
[MRS. HAYASHI]
We insist.

307
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:16,358
Use it to buy a few things
you want and have fun.

308
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:18,817
'Kay.

[ANZU gasping]

310
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:24,650
[ANZU]
This is so much money!

311
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:35,192
[chuckles]

312
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:39,483
[ANZU laughing]

313
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:43,525
[ANZU giggles]
I guess I can show you.

314
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:44,858
[HITOMI]
Show me what?

315
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:47,025
I'm not gonna tell anybody else.

316
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:49,525
Try not to be too shocked, okay?

317
00:14:49,608 --> 00:14:51,233
Wow. What is it?

318
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:54,692
See? Pretty amazing, amirite?

319
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:56,150
[HITOMI]
Hm? What is?

320
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:57,400
[gasps]

321
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,983
Well, 5,000 yen is a lot
of money. That's all.

322
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:06,692
Oh! Sure it is!

323
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:08,150
That's great, Anzu!

324
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:10,858
I was so surprised,
I didn't know what to say!

325
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:11,775
Of course!

326
00:15:11,858 --> 00:15:13,358
Yeah, I thought you would be!

327
00:15:13,442 --> 00:15:16,108
It sorta took my breath away
when I first saw it, too.

328
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:17,733
[HITOMI laughs]

329
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,483
Anyway, my mom and pop
told me to have fun

330
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:23,483
and buy whatever I
wanted with it, but...

331
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:25,858
...I don't really
know what I should do.

332
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:29,275
[ANZU]
Hm...

333
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:31,067
[HITOMI] So you roll
the ball down the aisle

334
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,567
and try to knock down
as many pins as you can!

335
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,108
Yeah, but... I could line
up sticks at the park

336
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:38,192
and knock those over
with a ball for free.

337
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:39,942
Uh--

338
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:41,275
How's this?

339
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,442
[ANZU]
I can sing in the bath.

340
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,858
I can drink water at the park.

341
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:49,900
[HITOMI]
See something you like?

342
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:52,067
Eh...

343
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,483
Not really.

344
00:15:54,775 --> 00:15:56,233
[HITOMI]
She's not much of a consumer.

345
00:15:56,317 --> 00:15:57,150
[ANZU gasps]

346
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:01,150
[ANZU] Why are they packing
that stuff in such a fancy box?

347
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:02,983
[HITOMI]
Because it's a present.

348
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:04,525
[ANZU]
What's that?

349
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:07,150
It's something you give to
a person you care about.

350
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,483
To show how much you
appreciate them.

351
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,525
Ohh.

352
00:16:11,608 --> 00:16:12,775
[ANZU gasps]

353
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:15,400
I know what to do!

354
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:16,983
[ANZU whines]

355
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:18,858
I don't have enough
money to buy this.

356
00:16:18,942 --> 00:16:20,942
Then we'll find something else.

357
00:16:21,025 --> 00:16:22,525
I dunno.

358
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:24,442
Mom and Pop are always saying
how stiff their shoulders are.

359
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,650
They'd probably like it!

360
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:26,858
Huh?

361
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:29,567
They do so much to take
care of me every day

362
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:33,483
and I want them to know just
how grateful I am for that.

363
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:34,858
[HITOMI]
What a good daughter!

364
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:37,817
I never do thoughtful
stuff for my mom!

365
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,817
[HITOMI] If you want,
I can make up the difference.

366
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,900
[SABU]
Hey, look who it is!

367
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,733
[HITOMI] Oh, what are
you doing here, Sabu?

368
00:16:43,817 --> 00:16:45,692
The old man needs
his feet massaged,

369
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:47,983
so I'm picking up
stuff for that.

370
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:50,150
You said you're having
some money trouble?

371
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:51,400
[ANZU]
Mm-hmm.

372
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:52,858
I told her I'd pay for
the rest of it, though--

373
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:54,608
But everyone knows
a gift is worthless

374
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:56,942
if you didn't buy it
with your own money!

375
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:58,358
Then what should we do?

376
00:16:58,442 --> 00:17:00,483
[SABU]
Hmph. Come with me.

377
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:01,858
[HITOMI, ANZU]
Huh?

378
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:05,192
[SABU] If you need more
money, then just make some.

379
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,525
[HITOMI gasps]

380
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:09,775
[ANZU]
What's this place?

381
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:12,650
[SABU] Heh. The best
way to get quick cash.

382
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:14,858
Horse races, of course!

383
00:17:14,942 --> 00:17:16,692
A world of fortune and fun!

384
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:18,525
[HITOMI]
Wait a minute, Sabu!

385
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:20,817
Are you gonna turn
Anzu into a gambler?

386
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,108
Nah, don't worry.

387
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:23,942
I'll buy all her
tickets for her.

388
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:25,317
[HITOMI]
That doesn't fix it!

389
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,775
[HITOMI] Oh, man! I thought
Sabu could help her out

390
00:17:27,858 --> 00:17:28,942
since he's a grownup,

391
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:30,858
but he's just another kid!

392
00:17:30,942 --> 00:17:32,108
Come to think of it,

393
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:34,692
have I ever met an adult
I could actually trust?

394
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:36,400
Nope! Not one!

395
00:17:36,483 --> 00:17:38,900
Look, Anzu! You can't
gamble with money you saved

396
00:17:38,983 --> 00:17:40,275
to buy someone a gift, okay?

397
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:41,692
--Promise me you won't!
--[SABU] It's money.

398
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:43,567
There's no right or wrong.

399
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,983
Besides, Anzu.

400
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:46,483
If your heart is pure,

401
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,942
then the gods of horse-racing
will answer your prayers.

402
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:50,358
[ANZU gasps]

403
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:51,900
Are you ready?

404
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:56,733
Yeah, let's do this!

405
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:58,108
[HITOMI groans]

406
00:17:58,192 --> 00:18:01,817
Okay, then. I'm gonna go
take some stomach medicine.

407
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,733
[SABU] Since it's your first
time, we'll do a simple ticket.

408
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,900
All you have to do is guess
which horse will come in first.

409
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:09,233
[ANZU]
Hmm...

410
00:18:09,317 --> 00:18:11,567
I'll bet 500 yen
on Haikei Catalog.

411
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,108
[SABU]
He's rated worst.

412
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,400
Yeah, but... I get more
if he wins, right?

413
00:18:15,483 --> 00:18:18,525
Wow. Spoken like a true gambler.

414
00:18:18,608 --> 00:18:20,858
I doubt it'll happen, though.

415
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:21,942
[ANNOUNCER]
Look at that!

416
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:23,483
Despite being the favored racer,

417
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:26,525
Screen Tone takes a nasty
fall and loses the lead!

418
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:29,483
The underdog Haikei Catalog
is now in first!

419
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,192
This is quite a
surprising upset!

420
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:32,900
No way! That's crazy!

421
00:18:32,983 --> 00:18:35,817
This goes way beyond
beginner's luck!

422
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,442
The odds were 90:1, so that's...

423
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:41,025
[ANZU]
Forty-five thousand yen!

424
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,608
Great, you've got enough
money. Can we go home?

425
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:48,150
[SABU] No, wait! The races
are just getting started!

426
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:49,983
Besides, Anzu's on a roll here!

427
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:52,483
[ANZU gasps]
I have to do it again!

428
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:53,983
[HITOMI, SABU gasp]

429
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:55,525
If I win more,

430
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:58,108
I can buy lots of
gifts for my parents!

431
00:18:58,192 --> 00:18:58,983
Ooh!

432
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:00,400
[HITOMI groans]

433
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:02,567
It looked like he took a
pretty serious fall down there.

434
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,067
Yeah, broke his leg.

435
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,025
He's horse meat now.

436
00:19:06,108 --> 00:19:07,067
[ANZU gasps]

437
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:10,983
What's gonna happen to him?

438
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,483
He can't race
with a broken leg.

439
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:13,733
I'm sure they'll put him down.

440
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:14,775
[ANZU gasps]

441
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:19,150
[SABU] Anyway,
let's head to the next race.

442
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:20,525
Okay.

443
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,067
[ANZU, SABU whine]

444
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,150
Ooh! I won!

445
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,233
Come on!

446
00:19:28,317 --> 00:19:29,483
Now what?

447
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:31,483
Only one more race.

448
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,358
Five-hundred left.

449
00:19:33,442 --> 00:19:36,567
I need to multiply
that by like 20!

450
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,858
Tracedai.

451
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:39,233
He's favored in sixth.

452
00:19:39,317 --> 00:19:41,025
[SABU]
Uh, sure.

453
00:19:41,108 --> 00:19:44,233
Anzu, don't bet
everything on one.

454
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:45,650
[ANZU]
I made a mistake.

455
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:46,900
[BOTH]
Huh?

456
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:49,067
After the first race...

457
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,608
...I guess I
started to get greedy

458
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:53,067
and wanted to win more and more.

459
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,483
That was dumb.

460
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:57,317
The god of horse-racing
must be mad.

461
00:19:58,608 --> 00:20:00,817
So I won't do that anymore!

462
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,442
I'm betting everything
I have on Tracedai!

463
00:20:03,525 --> 00:20:05,525
[BOTH]
Uh...

464
00:20:05,608 --> 00:20:07,858
[ANNOUNCER] It doesn't look like
there's a clear path to victory

465
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:10,650
for sixth-favored Tracedai.

466
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:12,025
[ANZU]
This is bad.

467
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:15,150
There's no way he's
gonna win the race!

468
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:17,442
Agh, my shoulder's so sore!

469
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:20,233
Yeah, I guess our age is
catching up to us, dear.

470
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:23,442
[MR. HAYASHI]
Ah, yeah, seems that way.

471
00:20:23,525 --> 00:20:25,358
[ANZU]
With my powers,

472
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:29,192
I can make that other horse
fall like in the first race.

473
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:30,650
Yeah, broke his leg.

474
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:32,442
He's horse meat now.

475
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:33,900
My shoulder's so sore.

476
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,192
[ANZU]
Pop...

477
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,525
[CROWD MEMBER B]
He's horse meat now.

478
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:38,067
[ANZU]
I...

479
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:38,900
Shoulders.

480
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:40,192
[ANZU]
Mom...

481
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:43,733
Horse meat. Horse meat.

482
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:49,608
[ANNOUNCER]
The winner is Select Pause!

483
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:53,317
[ANZU] I can't turn
you into horse meat!

484
00:20:53,400 --> 00:21:00,067
[ANZU crying]

485
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:04,900
[ANZU] All I wanted to do
was buy them a present...

486
00:21:04,983 --> 00:21:06,483
...but now I'm broke!

487
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:09,400
[ANZU cries]

488
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:10,483
Anzu?

489
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:11,483
[ANZU]
Hm?

490
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:12,983
The important part
of gift-giving

491
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:15,358
isn't what you
spend. Not at all.

492
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,525
[gasps]

493
00:21:19,317 --> 00:21:22,233
[ANZU] Hey, Mom and Pop,
I have something to give you.

494
00:21:22,317 --> 00:21:24,775
Oh? What's that?

495
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:26,317
A present.

496
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:31,067
[BOTH gasp]

497
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,650
[MR. HAYASHI]
Wow.

498
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:35,358
[HITOMI] You don't have to
spend any money on it.

499
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:37,817
The most important thing

500
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,900
is that the person knows
how much you care.

501
00:21:39,983 --> 00:21:41,942
Yeah, well said, Hitomi.

502
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:47,525
I just wanted a way to say thank
you, for everything you both do.

503
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:50,483
I'm sorry if it's not
a very good present.

504
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:52,275
[MR. HAYASHI, MRS. HAYASHI
laugh]

505
00:21:52,358 --> 00:21:54,442
No, it's a lovely present, Anzu.

506
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:56,942
Okay if I use one right now?

507
00:21:59,858 --> 00:22:00,858
Mm-hmm!

508
00:22:01,942 --> 00:22:03,317
[ANZU]
Does that feel good?

509
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,358
[MR. HAYASHI sighs] I think
I could get used to this.

510
00:22:07,442 --> 00:22:09,442
I'll give Mom one next!

511
00:22:09,525 --> 00:22:11,483
[MRS. HAYASHI chuckles]
Well, I wouldn't want to

512
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:13,108
use them all up too fast!

513
00:22:13,192 --> 00:22:15,525
[ANZU] If you do,
I'll make you some more!

514
00:23:47,108 --> 00:23:48,358
[HINA]
Next time,

515
00:23:48,442 --> 00:23:51,358
"A Man Thirsty for Blood,
Violence, and Money."
