1
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:17,483
[HINA] I had lots of fun
living with you, Nitta.

2
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:19,525
Thanks for everything.

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,858
[HINA] I couldn't tell
you I was leaving.

4
00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:24,775
I didn't really want to go,

5
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,275
and I was afraid of what
you might say about it.

6
00:00:28,358 --> 00:00:30,067
But I have no choice.

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,275
I have to return home.

8
00:00:32,358 --> 00:00:35,108
Because if I don't
do what they say,

9
00:00:35,192 --> 00:00:37,150
they're gonna
rip my head off.

10
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:40,275
Are you ready
to get going, Hina?

11
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:41,692
[HINA]
Mm-hmm.

12
00:00:46,108 --> 00:00:47,775
[HINA]
Bye forever, Nitta.

13
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,942
[IKARUGA]
Looks like I made it.

14
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:41,025
Despite Hina's presence here,
the city appears to be at peace.

15
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:42,817
[ANZU]
Back from deliveries!

16
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,858
[MRS. HAYASHI]
Welcome home!

17
00:02:44,942 --> 00:02:46,275
Huh?

18
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:48,192
Well, if it isn't Anzu.

19
00:02:48,275 --> 00:02:50,067
I assumed you had been killed.

20
00:02:50,858 --> 00:02:53,775
You're the chief of... security.

21
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:55,483
Ika...

22
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:56,400
Ika-something.

23
00:02:56,483 --> 00:02:58,192
Kei Ikaruga.

24
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:02,400
Why did you come here?

25
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:05,108
No, wait, I already know.

26
00:03:05,192 --> 00:03:07,358
Don't do it in
front of them, okay?

27
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:09,400
Let's go somewhere quiet.

28
00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:13,192
All right, go ahead
and finish me off.

29
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:15,817
Thanks, Mom and Pop.
You're the best!

30
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,650
I lived a pretty decent life!

31
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:19,900
[IKARUGA] Why are you
acting like you're going to die?

32
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:22,942
When you didn't come home,
you were classified K.I.A.

33
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:24,025
There'd be no point.

34
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:25,400
Huh?

35
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:27,900
I'm only here to investigate
Hina's behavior, Anzu.

36
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:28,983
You don't matter.

37
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:30,733
Feel free go on
living as you see fit.

38
00:03:30,817 --> 00:03:33,233
[ANZU]
Did you just say I don't matter?

39
00:03:33,317 --> 00:03:35,067
Hold on.

40
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,358
Is there any reason
to spy on Hina now?

41
00:03:39,442 --> 00:03:40,775
You were sent out
to subdue Hina

42
00:03:40,858 --> 00:03:43,483
after we discarded her
due to her lack of control,

43
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:45,317
but since she's too
powerful for us to properly

44
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,275
dispose of,
we've decided to learn

45
00:03:47,358 --> 00:03:52,150
what we can from watching
her in her new surroundings.

46
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,192
[ANZU] Looks like stuff
a five-year-old could do.

47
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,858
[IKARUGA] The more
"yes" responses, the better.

48
00:03:56,942 --> 00:03:58,733
[ANZU] Are you sure
this is a good idea?

49
00:03:58,817 --> 00:04:00,775
Not much else we can do.

50
00:04:00,858 --> 00:04:02,650
It is Hina.

51
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:05,942
[IKARUGA]
Nope, going home!

52
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:07,775
[ANZU] Wait! You haven't
done your job yet!

53
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:09,317
[IKARUGA]
I'm too young to die, Anzu!

54
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,525
Screw my stupid boss.

55
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:11,608
I'm only human!

56
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:13,525
I don't get paid
enough for this crap!

57
00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:14,733
Can't be too hard.

58
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:16,942
You always got me
to listen to you.

59
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:19,192
[IKARUGA] But Hina destroyed
her collar when she snapped

60
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:21,358
and started wreaking
havoc on the city.

61
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:24,275
I have no way of
controlling her if she resists.

62
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:25,692
Makes sense.

63
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:28,025
By the way, how's she
been adjusting to this world?

64
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:31,150
A guy named Nitta started
taking care of her a while ago.

65
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,858
They're pretending
she's his daughter.

66
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:34,025
[gasps]

67
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,358
What a courageous man,

68
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,233
staring into the face
of death and destruction!

69
00:04:41,983 --> 00:04:44,192
There she is.

70
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:46,608
[IKARUGA]
How did she get a broken leg?

71
00:04:46,692 --> 00:04:48,567
I think she said Nitta
was spinning her around

72
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,067
and smacked her
into a wall really hard.

73
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,567
That man is a national hero!

74
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,567
I wonder what this
Nitta person's like?

75
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,650
He must work out.

76
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:58,817
Aren't you on a
mission or something?

77
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,567
There's no way any of
these are going to be a yes.

78
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,525
[gasps]

79
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:03,858
Wait a minute,

80
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:05,192
maybe I'll turn it in with
"no"s all the way down--

81
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:06,692
No, just do your job!

82
00:05:06,775 --> 00:05:10,025
I'm familiar with Hina's habits,
so I know what to expect.

83
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:12,025
Red lights, for example.

84
00:05:13,442 --> 00:05:15,817
[IKARUGA] If she's not given a
command, she'll probably destroy

85
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,108
the traffic signal and
wipe out the oncoming cars.

86
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:21,942
[IKARUGA]
She stopped?

87
00:05:22,025 --> 00:05:24,150
I don't believe it.
That's impossible!

88
00:05:28,442 --> 00:05:30,233
She's loaded!

89
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,775
Oh, hey there, Hina!

90
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:37,692
[HINA]
Hey.

91
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:38,608
[IKARUGA]
No.

92
00:05:38,692 --> 00:05:41,192
This is the wrong girl!

93
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,775
[IKARUGA]
Low-ranking yakuza thugs.

94
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:47,942
Here we go.

95
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:49,900
She'll send those
three flying, for sure!

96
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,942
That's it, kill them!

97
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:53,858
--Kill them all!
--Whoa.

98
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:59,650
You're kidding.

99
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:03,400
It's starting to rain,

100
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:04,983
so we should probably
call it a day now.

101
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:07,525
[ANZU] You sure do
change your mind a lot.

102
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:08,858
Fine.

103
00:06:08,942 --> 00:06:11,150
That was only the novice level.

104
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:14,108
I say we find out how she
scores on the advanced version.

105
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:16,067
[ANZU]
You just have to get a "no."

106
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,233
[IKARUGA]
I know exactly where to start.

107
00:06:19,317 --> 00:06:20,483
[ANZU]
Huh?

108
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:22,733
I don't think there are
any animals around here.

109
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:24,067
[IKARUGA]
Hmph.

110
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,067
Then we'll get one from
that pet shop and leave it

111
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,983
in a box where she'll
see it on her way home.

112
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,275
[IKARUGA laughs]

113
00:06:45,358 --> 00:06:48,067
I knew it all along,
that girl is a monster!

114
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,900
Look, she's even
stealing an umbrella!

115
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:51,442
She can't be stopped!

116
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:53,817
I bet that counts
for so many "no"s!

117
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,608
Hey, uh...

118
00:06:58,483 --> 00:06:59,358
[IKARUGA]
No.

119
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:01,108
Nonononono!

120
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:02,983
Don't you do it!

121
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:07,233
[IKARUGA wails]

122
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:10,608
[IKARUGA]
"Cares for animals" is a yes!

123
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:13,358
[HINA]
You're homeless, huh?

124
00:07:13,442 --> 00:07:15,233
I know what that's like.

125
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:22,108
So, what should we do now?

126
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,233
I guess I've lost.

127
00:07:24,317 --> 00:07:26,442
Hina's really grown up
since she's been here,

128
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:28,150
much more than I anticipated.

129
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:29,108
[ANZU]
No.

130
00:07:29,192 --> 00:07:30,692
I mean the puppy.

131
00:07:30,775 --> 00:07:32,442
Woof.

132
00:07:32,525 --> 00:07:33,567
Maybe you should take it.

133
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,692
I can't. I live in a restaurant.

134
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,192
[IKARUGA]
What?

135
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:40,858
I didn't see this!

Hina's psychological condition

Hina's actually got powers!

And I'm probably the
first person to find out too!

00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:26,275
It's Hina.

162
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,775
Do you think she's hiding some
kind of unbelievable secret?

163
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:29,900
Secret?

164
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:31,150
I don't think so.

165
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:33,733
What is she to
you anyway, a friend?

166
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:35,442
Uh...

167
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:37,650
Nah, just another thing
that eats and sleeps.

168
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:39,067
[MAMI]
Wow, that's rough!

169
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,025
Does she know
how mean she sounds?

170
00:09:41,108 --> 00:09:43,317
[TEACHER] Who knows what
Sentence A is describing?

171
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,525
[MAMI]
Man.

172
00:09:44,608 --> 00:09:46,192
After all I've read
about telekinetic powers

173
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:48,108
and secret organizations,

174
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:51,192
I still have no idea how to
get information out of people!

175
00:09:51,275 --> 00:09:53,150
What should I do?

176
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:55,108
Hey, she's talking to you.

177
00:09:55,192 --> 00:09:56,775
Yes, Mommy?

178
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:01,067
Oh, my.

179
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,733
I'm not your mommy.

180
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:07,358
[MAMI]
Okay, that's it!

181
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:11,483
I'm just gonna have
to confront her directly!

182
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:15,108
Tell me, Hina.

183
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:17,692
You're a super-powered girl
created by the organization,

184
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:19,275
isn't that right?

185
00:10:22,858 --> 00:10:24,275
How did you know?

186
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:25,567
[gasps]

187
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,650
[MAMI]
Oh, wow, so it is true!

188
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:30,775
Subscribing to <i>Mar Monthly</i>
was money well spent!

189
00:10:30,858 --> 00:10:32,567
Can't let him find out.

190
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,483
[screams]

191
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:37,942
[MAMI]
Spare me!

192
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:40,858
I beg you!

193
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:41,608
I don't know.

194
00:10:41,692 --> 00:10:42,900
[MAMI]
I'm sorry, okay?

195
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:45,025
I accidentally saw
you use your powers!

196
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:47,275
All I wanted to do was talk
to you about the organization

197
00:10:47,358 --> 00:10:50,483
and bending spoons
and stuff, I swear!

198
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:54,067
Please don't make me disappear!

199
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:57,025
[MAMI] That's the coolest
thing I've ever heard, Hina!

200
00:10:57,108 --> 00:10:59,983
So your powers just like
awakened out of the blue?

201
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:01,025
You can't tell anyone.

202
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:02,567
No problem!

203
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,942
I'm sure there's no such thing
as the organization, right?

204
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:06,192
[IKARUGA
"At least one friend."

205
00:11:06,275 --> 00:11:07,400
"Yes."

206
00:11:07,483 --> 00:11:08,400
You're so lucky!

207
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:10,067
No fair!

208
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,275
I know!

209
00:11:11,358 --> 00:11:13,317
Can you teach me to
move stuff with my mind?

210
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,483
Huh? What for?

211
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:16,400
That'd make me awesome!

212
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:17,900
Just like you!

213
00:11:17,983 --> 00:11:19,775
You're my hero!

214
00:11:19,858 --> 00:11:20,942
Your hero?

215
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:22,400
That's weird.

216
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:24,983
Let me soak up
your coolness, Hina!

217
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:26,192
No, Master!

218
00:11:26,275 --> 00:11:27,733
I'm calling you Master!

219
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:29,317
Teach me your ways!

220
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,483
Lend me strength!

221
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,942
So you're not kidding, then?

222
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:35,942
[MAMI]
Wow, that's crazy!

223
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:38,108
You make it look easy, Master!

224
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:40,817
Okay, here goes.

225
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,067
Up!

226
00:11:45,692 --> 00:11:46,942
Nothing.

227
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:48,442
How does this even work?

228
00:11:48,525 --> 00:11:50,025
Is there like a word?

229
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:53,233
Not really,
I kinda just feel it.

230
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:55,483
Oh. Feel it.

231
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:57,150
Right!

232
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:04,525
We're not leaving
till it works, are we?

233
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:06,608
[yellhs]

234
00:12:08,192 --> 00:12:10,358
[gasps]

235
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:13,233
I... I did it!

236
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,067
I have the gift!

237
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,317
And I only trained for one day.

238
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,150
I must be some kind of genius.

239
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:21,192
That's great, let's go home.

240
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:31,650
Mami, dear?

241
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:35,067
Hey! Let's train
again after school!

242
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,400
Um. Yeah. Sure.

243
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:38,608
Yay!

244
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:41,067
I can't wait to learn more,
O Wise Master!

245
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,275
Check it out!

246
00:12:42,358 --> 00:12:44,442
I'm totally on fire today!

247
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:46,150
Congrats, can we go now?

248
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,358
You know.

249
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:49,442
I've really gotten good
at this mind stuff.

250
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:52,067
I feel like I'm finally figuring
out how to connect the wires

251
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,858
in my brain to use my powers.

252
00:12:53,942 --> 00:12:56,108
Mami.

253
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,608
Can we talk?

254
00:12:58,858 --> 00:13:01,275
[HINA] Nobody can ever
know about your powers.

255
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:04,108
You can't use them
if I'm not around.

256
00:13:04,192 --> 00:13:07,025
[MAMI] I know I have
to keep this a secret, but...

257
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:12,317
[MAMI] ...I want to brag
about it so bad!

258
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,567
[yells]

259
00:13:15,858 --> 00:13:19,275
[MAMI] Who does she think
she is, telling me that?

260
00:13:19,358 --> 00:13:21,858
I'm telekinetic,
just like she is!

261
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:26,108
She can't keep being
my master forever.

262
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:27,608
Hmph.

263
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:28,775
[KENGO]
Let's go, Takashi!

264
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:29,692
Yeah!

265
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,358
[MAMI]
Don't leave yet, guys!

266
00:13:33,442 --> 00:13:36,025
I have something
I want to show you!

267
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,608
Gotta do it while she's asleep!

268
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:48,733
It might be hard
to believe this is real,

269
00:13:48,817 --> 00:13:51,900
so look closely
and witness my power!

270
00:13:55,983 --> 00:13:57,358
[chuckles]

271
00:13:57,442 --> 00:14:01,067
There's a new
telekinetic in town, Hina!

272
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,817
Observe!

273
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,983
Now, I'll just reconnect
the wires in my brain, and...

274
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:08,400
Rise!

275
00:14:09,358 --> 00:14:10,650
Rise!

276
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,483
Rise! Come on, you
stupid thing, rise!

277
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:42,025
[HITOMI]
After that,

278
00:14:42,108 --> 00:14:45,692
Mami Shinjou was never
seen or heard from again.

279
00:14:46,608 --> 00:14:49,400
[MAMI'S MOTHER]
Mami, open the door, dear.

280
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:51,483
[HITOMI]
For two days.

281
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:53,150
[MAMI'S MOTHER]
Hello? Are you okay in there?

282
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,650
Answer me! Mami--

283
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,942
[HINA]
Yes, freedom is mine!

284
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:14,858
I'm Kei Ikaruga.

285
00:15:14,942 --> 00:15:17,025
I'm from the organization.

286
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,108
And I've been sent here
to bring you back to them.

287
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:25,358
[HINA]
No.

288
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:26,525
[gasps]

289
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:29,233
You have no choice.
It's an order!

290
00:15:29,317 --> 00:15:31,400
Order?

291
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:34,692
[HINA]
Fine.

292
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:37,108
[IKARUGA] Wow, that
was easier than I thought.

293
00:15:37,192 --> 00:15:40,108
Well yeah, if I don't listen,
they'll pop off my head.

294
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:44,483
[IKARUGA] I get it, she still
thinks she has the collar on!

295
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:46,442
We leave in three days.

296
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:49,358
First, I have to find a
home for a stray puppy.

297
00:15:49,442 --> 00:15:50,775
[HINA]
Mm-hmm.

298
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:03,358
[NITTA]
Augh!

299
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:08,317
[HINA barfs]

300
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,358
[NITTA]
You okay over there?

301
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,817
[HINA]
Nitta.

302
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,567
What's wrong?

303
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:16,483
Nitta.

304
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:18,400
[NITTA]
Uh...

305
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:19,775
[HINA]
Nitta.

306
00:16:19,858 --> 00:16:21,400
Nitta!

307
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:22,900
Spit it out!

308
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,192
I'm gonna... I mean...

309
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,108
I have to...

310
00:16:26,192 --> 00:16:27,733
[NITTA]
What is your problem?

311
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,858
[IKARUGA]
We leave in three days.

312
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,942
That's me, Nitta.

313
00:16:34,025 --> 00:16:35,192
Where?

314
00:16:37,983 --> 00:16:39,692
Are you trying to tell
me you're a foreign prince

315
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:42,233
disguising himself
as a little girl?

316
00:16:43,358 --> 00:16:45,275
[NITTA] You're the ghost of
some ancient queen, then?

317
00:16:45,358 --> 00:16:46,775
No, that's impossible.

318
00:16:46,858 --> 00:16:48,858
[NITTA]
Says the super-powered freak!

319
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,942
Look.

320
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:00,275
Hina--

321
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:05,733
Time for breakfast, short stuff.

322
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,358
You there?

323
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:12,233
Okay.

324
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:14,150
Something's not right.

325
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:23,317
[HINA]
Owwie.

326
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,525
I'm sorry, we did
everything we could do, but...

327
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:28,858
...there was nothing wrong.

328
00:17:28,942 --> 00:17:31,358
[NITTA]
Maybe a vacation?

329
00:17:31,442 --> 00:17:34,108
Oh, do you think some good
seafood might cheer you up?

330
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:36,192
Wait. I... I don't think I'm--

331
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:38,400
[NITTA] That's it,
I've had enough of this!

332
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:40,567
Whatever you're hiding,
you better fess up!

333
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,483
Tell me right now!

334
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,067
Hey, calm down!

335
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:59,400
[HINA]
No trips, okay?

336
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:01,358
Are you evolving, or what?

337
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:05,358
[HINA] Sorry, but I've
been ordered to go home.

338
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:07,692
Huh? Come again?

339
00:18:07,775 --> 00:18:09,733
[HINA]
And I have to leave today.

340
00:18:09,817 --> 00:18:11,067
What?

341
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:17,900
[door opens]

342
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,900
[HINA]
Huh? That's it?

343
00:18:24,025 --> 00:18:25,483
I was dreading it, too.

344
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:27,608
So much for my note.

345
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:28,900
[NITTA]
Let's go, Hina.

346
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,233
Huh?

347
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,067
Time's wasting.

348
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:38,150
Eat up, kid.

349
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:41,400
I'm gonna give you
one more good dinner.

350
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:42,858
They said
I could only eat stuff

351
00:18:42,942 --> 00:18:45,733
that's easy to digest
after the gastroscope.

352
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:46,775
Who cares?

353
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:48,692
Do you want salmon roe
or porridge?

354
00:18:48,775 --> 00:18:50,900
Salmon roe, hands down.

355
00:18:58,525 --> 00:18:59,567
It's good.

356
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,108
It's just, my tummy
doesn't feel well.

357
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,567
[NITTA]
Is this spot okay?

358
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,025
[HINA]
Yeah.

359
00:19:25,858 --> 00:19:26,775
Bye.

360
00:19:26,858 --> 00:19:29,483
Look, Hina.

361
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:32,150
You were nothing but trouble
for me during your time here.

362
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:35,608
A grade-A pain in the ass.

363
00:19:35,692 --> 00:19:37,192
But you're leaving,

364
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:41,233
and to be honest, the thought
of that is making my head spin.

365
00:19:41,317 --> 00:19:48,358
Either way, having you
around--it was a lot of fun.

366
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,525
Yeah, I know.

367
00:19:58,275 --> 00:19:59,358
[HINA]
Nitta?

368
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,442
I'm grateful for you.

369
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:18,108
[NITTA]
What was that?

370
00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:19,733
Strange kid.

371
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:22,733
[NITTA]
Somewhere along the way.

372
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:24,275
I guess she grew up.

373
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:44,858
[IKARUGA]
Okay, time to go.

374
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:46,817
You brought your
orb with you, right?

375
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,942
[HINA]
Orb?

376
00:20:48,025 --> 00:20:48,775
[IKARUGA]
The one you were encased in

377
00:20:48,858 --> 00:20:50,608
when you first arrived here.

378
00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:52,608
You gifteds need
those when you fly,

379
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:55,483
or else you could end up
at the wrong coordinates.

380
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:56,858
Umm...

381
00:20:58,775 --> 00:20:59,483
That?

382
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:00,942
I lost it a long time ago.

383
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:02,442
[IKARUGA]
What? How?

384
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:04,150
Well, Nitta.

385
00:21:05,817 --> 00:21:07,317
[NITTA]
What the hell?

386
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,983
This thing's a piece of garbage!

387
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:11,692
What is it even for?

388
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:14,192
He got mad and trashed it.

389
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:17,858
So, it's gone because a
grown man threw a tantrum?

390
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:19,817
[HINA]
That's what I said, isn't it?

391
00:21:22,358 --> 00:21:25,650
[IKARUGA] Without that orb,
you have no way back home.

392
00:21:26,983 --> 00:21:30,608
[HINA] That means
I can stay with Nitta!

393
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:42,442
[HINA]
I can't wait to see his face.

394
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:44,817
He must be so sad right now.

395
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,858
Maybe he's even crying!

396
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:54,317
Ni... tta.

397
00:22:09,983 --> 00:22:13,692
[NITTA]
Uh, I can explain.

398
00:22:13,775 --> 00:22:15,650
Start talking.

399
00:23:47,983 --> 00:23:50,692
[HITOMI] Next time,
"Life Is About Survival."
