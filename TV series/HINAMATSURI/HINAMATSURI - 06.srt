1
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:14,192
[NITTA]
I'm home.

2
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:15,983
[HINA]
Hello?

3
00:00:16,067 --> 00:00:18,400
Yes. Yes.

4
00:00:18,483 --> 00:00:20,400
[NITTA] Whoever it is,
we don't want any.

5
00:00:20,483 --> 00:00:23,775
Wow. Are you really Nitta's mom?

6
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:26,733
Mm-hmm. Yeah, we live together.

7
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:29,275
[HINA]
Owwie!

8
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:30,108
Hiya, Mom--

9
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:31,108
[NITTA'S MOM]
Yoshifumi!

10
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:32,525
Who was that
young lady just now?

11
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:34,650
Young lady? That's weird.

12
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:36,192
Are you sure it wasn't a ghost?

13
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:38,192
[NITTA'S MOM]
Don't lie to your mother!

14
00:00:38,275 --> 00:00:40,733
[HINA]
I'm telling your mom on you.

15
00:02:15,608 --> 00:02:16,817
What're we doing?

16
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,192
[NITTA]
Praying.

17
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:20,858
My old man's dead, so I
check in with him sometimes.

18
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:22,192
The old man isn't dead.

19
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,275
I saw him.

20
00:02:23,358 --> 00:02:25,900
[NITTA]
Not him, my actual dad.

21
00:02:25,983 --> 00:02:27,983
I should say hi
to my family, too.

22
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:29,442
Are you up for that?

23
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:30,650
I got this.

24
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:31,650
I won't mess up!

25
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:34,025
That's promising.

26
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:38,400
Hina, this is my mom
and my little sister Mika.

27
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:40,025
Say hello.

28
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:43,358
[HINA]
My name's Hina Adachi.

29
00:02:43,442 --> 00:02:45,025
I'm 13 years old.

30
00:02:45,108 --> 00:02:47,858
My dad's in prison, and I don't
have any other family,

31
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:51,108
so I'm staying
with Nitta now.

32
00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:53,567
Nitta always treats
me really nicely, though.

33
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,275
So my life is super fun.

34
00:02:56,358 --> 00:02:58,608
Oh. Nice to meet you.

35
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:00,025
So, how long have
you and my brother

36
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:01,525
been living together, Hina?

37
00:03:01,608 --> 00:03:02,900
[NITTA]
Uh. Hang on!

38
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,317
Let's direct the questions
about Hina to me.

39
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,233
Are you her boss?

40
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:09,983
You don't have relatives
on your mother's side?

41
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:14,317
Hello.

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,317
I'm Hina Adachi, age 13.

43
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,233
What, are you a frickin' robot?

44
00:03:18,317 --> 00:03:19,608
C'mere.

45
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,567
I'll come up with the story.

46
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,275
You can just wait in the yard.

47
00:03:24,358 --> 00:03:26,025
[HINA]
I did what we practiced.

48
00:03:26,108 --> 00:03:28,400
But you suck at improvising.

49
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:30,317
It's easier to say
I'm taking care of you

50
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,692
and leave it at that.

51
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:34,317
Things'll get complicated
if we tell the truth.

52
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,483
Okay, I'll do my best.

53
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:40,567
Good. Do your
best outside, then.

54
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,817
[NITTA'S MOM]
That really happened to her?

55
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,150
[NITTA]
Yeah.

56
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:47,525
They went out to dinner,
and there was a big fight.

57
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:48,983
Her mom got shot.

58
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:50,150
Then, her father killed

59
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:52,692
two other people during
all the confusion.

60
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,192
He was like a brother to me.

61
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,567
I couldn't turn
my back on his kid.

62
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,233
That's why I took her in.

63
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:02,150
So Hina didn't
get injured at all?

64
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:04,775
Nope, she just ate
her chili shrimp.

65
00:04:04,858 --> 00:04:07,483
Ah! Chili shrimp?

66
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:08,733
Seconds, please.

67
00:04:08,817 --> 00:04:09,983
[NITTA]
That's right.

68
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,608
She was so traumatized

69
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:14,358
the shrimp is the only
thing she remembers!

70
00:04:14,442 --> 00:04:16,358
[NITTA'S MOM]
That poor child!

71
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:17,858
[NITTA] When Hina
first moved in with me,

72
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:20,025
I couldn't get a
word out of her.

73
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:25,067
But now, after all
she's been through,

74
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,025
she's finally
beginning to speak!

75
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,650
Wait.

76
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:32,942
Wasn't she talking about
having a fun life though?

77
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:36,150
Uh, that's because...

78
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:37,442
...she's always trying

79
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:41,317
to keep a smile on her face,
so I won't worry.

80
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,067
She's so strong!

81
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,275
[NITTA] That's why it's better
not to ask about her past.

82
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:51,025
[NITTA laughs]
Chili shrimp, that's rich!

83
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:52,900
Oh man. I'm really good.

84
00:04:52,983 --> 00:04:55,775
Maybe I oughtta be an actor!

85
00:04:55,858 --> 00:04:58,942
[NITTA'S MOM] We should probably
start making dinner, Yoshifumi.

86
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:01,483
[NITTA]
Sure, sounds good.

87
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,608
It'd be nice if you would cook.

88
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:06,775
Yeah, cook!

89
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:08,108
But I'm the guest.

90
00:05:08,192 --> 00:05:10,567
I assumed you'd do it
since you were coming by.

91
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,483
Why else would I have spent the
entire day chuggin' these beers?

92
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:16,650
[NITTA] That logic doesn't even
make sense to a drunk person.

93
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,358
Fine, if it's that
important to you,

94
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:20,983
then I guess I can
make us something.

95
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:22,983
Give me about three minutes
to boil the water.

96
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:24,567
[NITTA'S MOM]
Oh, it takes you three minutes?

97
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,108
I can do it in two.

98
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,358
[MIKA]
Nice one, Mom!

99
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:30,442
Yeah, on second thought,
I'll make dinner.

100
00:05:31,483 --> 00:05:33,442
[MIKA] First year
of middle school, huh?

101
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:34,733
I bet that's fun.

102
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:36,442
[HINA]
Nah, I sleep all day.

103
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:38,067
I do like lunch, though.

104
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,608
[NITTA]
Dammit.

105
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:41,942
School's expensive, at least
pretend like you're learning!

106
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:43,358
[laughs]

107
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:45,317
I bet you're not doing
your homework, either, are ya?

108
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,900
[HINA]
Ah! That's right.

109
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:50,900
I have homework.

110
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,317
[NITTA]
She bothered to bring it home?

111
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,067
I've never seen her do homework.

112
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,692
Why start now?

113
00:05:56,775 --> 00:06:00,275
Then again, if she's working
on that, she won't have to talk.

114
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:01,358
Good job, Hina!

115
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:03,067
Keep it up!

116
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:04,275
[MIKA]
Let's see.

117
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:06,275
What've we got?

118
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:07,900
Don't forget to write your name.

119
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:09,442
[HINA]
Oh yeah.

120
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:12,608
Uh!

121
00:06:12,692 --> 00:06:14,317
[MIKA]
Hina Nitta?

122
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,275
[NITTA gasps]

123
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:17,108
Oh! Uh, yeah, about that!

124
00:06:17,192 --> 00:06:18,025
Hold that thought.

125
00:06:18,108 --> 00:06:19,650
We cleared it with the school!

126
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:21,775
They said it's better
if she uses my last name,

127
00:06:21,858 --> 00:06:23,650
so the other kids
won't pick on her!

128
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:24,858
Heheh.

129
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:27,025
'Kay.

130
00:06:27,108 --> 00:06:29,025
And Hina doesn't mind
them calling her Nitta?

131
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:30,233
Nah, it's fine.

132
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:31,358
Right, Hina?

133
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:32,775
Uh...

134
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,150
I'm Hina. Hina Adachi.
I'm 13 years old.

135
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:44,108
[NITTA'S MOM]
This looks great!

136
00:06:46,358 --> 00:06:49,150
You sure do know your way around
the kitchen, don't you, bro?

137
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:50,692
From the looks of it,

138
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:52,817
I'd say you're enjoying your
new life at Yoshifumi's place.

139
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,608
Yeah, what's your
favorite thing about it?

140
00:06:55,692 --> 00:06:59,858
Well, if I had to pick one,
the gentleman's club.

141
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:02,400
[coughs]

142
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:03,192
Huh?

143
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:04,025
[NITTA]
Uh. I mean.

144
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:06,025
She said she wanted to go.

145
00:07:06,108 --> 00:07:08,275
All right, here's the thing.

146
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:11,692
On one hand,
it's no place for kids.

147
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:14,192
But then she looked at me

148
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:19,358
with those big puppy-dog eyes,
and I just couldn't tell her no!

149
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:21,692
Well, as long as you don't
take her there again.

150
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,567
[NITTA sighs]
That one was pretty easy.

151
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,358
I might be home free.

152
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:26,942
[NITTA'S MOM]
Let's have a few drinks.

153
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:28,608
[NITTA]
Yeah, why not?

154
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:35,942
Where'd the fireworks come from?

155
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:38,858
We had some visitors this
summer who brought their kids.

156
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:40,150
I guess they left 'em.

157
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:41,983
[MIKA]
Whatcha up to?

158
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:45,900
Hey.

159
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:47,983
We've got a killer over here!

160
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,192
Don't do that!

161
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:54,650
Their lives are
just as important

162
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:57,025
as anyone else's, Hina.

163
00:07:57,108 --> 00:08:00,983
We're all friends in this world!

164
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:03,275
[HINA]
They're my friends?

165
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,150
You're right. I'm sorry.

166
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:08,608
What are you doing?

167
00:08:10,358 --> 00:08:12,983
It's survival
of the fittest, kid.

168
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:15,067
Only the strong have
the power to decide

169
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,983
who lives and who dies.

170
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:20,400
My sister's insane.

171
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:22,358
Alcohol does that.

172
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:26,067
I wish you'd come over
and say hi more often.

173
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,525
I understand why you
keep your distance,

174
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,275
given the kind of work you do.

175
00:08:31,358 --> 00:08:34,317
But we're still
your family, you know.

176
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,442
Yeah. I get it.

177
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:39,192
Raising Hina must
be a challenging job.

178
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:41,858
We'll try to help you
out however we can.

179
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:44,358
Thanks, it's pretty tough.

180
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:47,067
Not long ago, I got fed up
and kicked her out.

181
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,733
Then everybody was like, "but
you're the one who took her in.

182
00:08:49,817 --> 00:08:51,400
You're a terrible dad!"

183
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:53,192
[NITTA'S MOM]
Did you just say, "dad"?

184
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:54,233
Uh...

185
00:08:58,483 --> 00:08:59,442
[NITTA]
Oh, crap!

186
00:08:59,525 --> 00:09:01,567
So much for being home free!

187
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,942
I'm confused.

188
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:04,983
Are you actually telling me
Hina's your daughter?

189
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:06,483
That's not what I said!

190
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:09,358
You'd better not be lying to
your own mother, Yoshifumi!

191
00:09:09,442 --> 00:09:10,983
I'm not!

192
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:14,442
[HINA]
No, Nitta's telling the truth.

193
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:16,567
[NITTA'S MOM]
Sweetheart, uh...

194
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,775
I don't think you
understand what's going on.

195
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,983
[MIKA]
Leave Hina alone, Mom!

196
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:24,858
Poor kid's so traumatized, she
only remembers the chili shrimp!

197
00:09:24,942 --> 00:09:26,192
Right?

198
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:28,233
Uh? The chili shrimp?

199
00:09:32,442 --> 00:09:35,358
[HINA]
I've never had chili shrimp.

200
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,650
Is it chilly like ice cream?

201
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:39,317
[MIKA]
What are you talking about?

202
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,067
[NITTA]
She's trying her best!

203
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:46,317
Even though she doesn't actually
know what chili shrimp is.

204
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,692
Compared to her first few days
here, she's grown up so much!

205
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:56,233
She's dumb, but she's gotten
really obedient lately!

206
00:09:56,317 --> 00:09:58,067
Still dumb, though.

207
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,150
What do you mean, "ice cream"?

208
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:01,775
Um. I was. You know.

209
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:04,108
[NITTA]
Don't worry about it, Hina.

210
00:10:04,192 --> 00:10:07,358
Even if you are terrible
with context clues.

211
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:09,483
I'm still proud!

212
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,525
Hold up.

213
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:13,692
[NITTA]
I was lying earlier, Mom.

214
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,150
Hina's my daughter!

215
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:17,025
I knew it!

216
00:10:17,108 --> 00:10:19,275
Bro! Why would you lie to us?

217
00:10:19,358 --> 00:10:21,442
[NITTA] Well, I just
found out she existed,

218
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:23,358
and I didn't know what
the two of you would say

219
00:10:23,442 --> 00:10:25,275
or if you'd believe me.

220
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,525
Either way, I've decided
to face this like a man!

221
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:29,442
You're kidding!

222
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:31,900
[NITTA'S MOM]
No, he isn't.

223
00:10:31,983 --> 00:10:34,567
I see it in his eyes.

224
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,650
I'll want the details later.

225
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:40,108
But I am to understand
she's your real daughter, yes?

226
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:40,983
[NITTA]
Yep.

227
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:43,150
And I'm her dad.

228
00:10:46,442 --> 00:10:47,858
[MIKA]
You don't sound old enough.

229
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:48,733
All right.

230
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:50,525
Then I'll say it like a grampa!

231
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,692
[laughs]

232
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:53,442
Dear.

233
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:54,483
[MIKA]
Yeah, I know.

234
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,692
First things first.

235
00:10:56,775 --> 00:10:58,108
We need to drink a toast

236
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:00,942
to welcome the newest
member of the Nitta family!

237
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:05,150
Starting tonight, Hina,
you are one of us!

238
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:05,983
[NITTA FAMILY]
Cheers!

239
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:07,233
[HINA]
Owwie!

240
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:08,650
[NITTA'S MOM]
Look, darling.

241
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:11,858
Our Yoshifumi's
given us a granddaughter.

242
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:14,858
Y'know, I think you've got
your grandfather's eyes, Hina!

243
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,067
[NITTA laughs]
Yeah, I don't think so.

244
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,108
What's funny?

245
00:11:18,192 --> 00:11:19,358
[NITTA]
Nothin' at all.

246
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:22,317
Don't you think you
should say a few words?

247
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:27,775
Hey there, pops.

248
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:30,483
Sorry you're not
still alive to meet her,

249
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:31,983
but Hina's your granddaughter.

250
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,525
[MIKA]
Is that all you got?

251
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:36,483
How's he s'posed to
hear you up in heaven?

252
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:40,108
Listen, pops, Hina's
one of the Nitta family now,

253
00:11:40,192 --> 00:11:42,108
so I want you to watch over her!

254
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:43,608
[NITTA'S MOM]
Hey.

255
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:45,192
Yoshifumi.

256
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:48,025
Are you being the best father
you can be for little Hina?

257
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,233
[NITTA]
Hell, yeah!

258
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:51,192
Tell 'im, big bro.

259
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:54,067
I'm gonna take
care of that kid

260
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,608
and spoil her for the
rest of my life!

261
00:11:56,692 --> 00:12:00,733
[NITTA FAMILY]
Yay! Yay! Ya!

262
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:03,858
Welcome to your
new family, Hina!

263
00:12:03,942 --> 00:12:05,275
Your turn, kid!

264
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,817
Y' wanna get acquainted
with your old granddad?

265
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,942
[NITTA'S MOM, MIKA]
Go on!

266
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:13,108
Uh, well...

267
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:15,108
I...

268
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,608
I'm Hina Nitta.

269
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:19,275
I'm 13 years old.

270
00:12:19,358 --> 00:12:21,150
[NITTA]
You can drop the act now.

271
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:25,442
[UTAKO] Let the homeless
keep their place!

272
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:28,192
[CROWD] Let the
homeless keep their place!

273
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:30,275
[UTAKO] They've got
nowhere else to stay!

274
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:33,067
[CROWD] They've
got nowhere else to stay!

275
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,067
[UTAKO] Let the homeless
keep their place!

276
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,650
[ANZU]
Hey, Yassan?

277
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:39,067
Huh?

278
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,483
What are all those people
yelling in the street for?

279
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:43,317
[YASSAN]
Uh...

280
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:48,067
I guess I better just tell you.

281
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,942
Huh?

282
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:52,858
I have a bit of bad news, Anzu.

283
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:54,983
It's about the park.

284
00:12:55,067 --> 00:13:00,025
Sorry, but we have to leave.

285
00:13:00,108 --> 00:13:04,150
Huh? Huuuh?!

286
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:05,275
[HOBO B]
I see.

287
00:13:05,358 --> 00:13:07,525
So Anzu found out
about the park, huh?

288
00:13:07,608 --> 00:13:09,358
It may not have lasted long,

289
00:13:09,442 --> 00:13:11,858
but it sure was fun
havin' that kid around.

290
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:14,733
Remember how happy she was
when we built her little house?

291
00:13:14,817 --> 00:13:15,817
And I'll never forget

292
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,817
making those cat's
cradles with her.

293
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,567
Me neither!

294
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,108
By the way, Yassan.

295
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:23,275
Did you straighten out
that deal with Utako?

296
00:13:23,358 --> 00:13:26,775
[YASSAN] She said she found
someone to take care of Anzu.

297
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:30,275
This is the way it should be.

298
00:13:30,358 --> 00:13:34,358
There's no place for us
in that little girl's future.

299
00:13:34,442 --> 00:13:36,442
[GOTO]
As long as Anzu's happy.

300
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,150
[HOBO D]
Yeah.

301
00:13:39,942 --> 00:13:44,192
[hammering]

302
00:13:44,275 --> 00:13:45,525
All done!

303
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,358
Hey, guys!

304
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:48,900
Oh, Anzu.

305
00:13:48,983 --> 00:13:51,108
We'd better start packing up.

306
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:52,067
Um.

307
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,650
What's that?

308
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,733
I thought we could hold up signs
like those people were doing.

309
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:57,067
[HOBOS]
Huh?

310
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:01,483
[sighs]

311
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:03,900
That'll draw too much attention.

312
00:14:03,983 --> 00:14:05,233
There's nothin' we can do.

313
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:06,900
[ANZU]
We can't just give up!

314
00:14:06,983 --> 00:14:08,400
What's the matter?

315
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:11,108
Hey! You'll help, right, Yassan?

316
00:14:11,192 --> 00:14:12,900
We gotta stand up for our home!

317
00:14:12,983 --> 00:14:14,442
Huh?

318
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:18,817
Sorry, Anzu.

319
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:22,442
[ANZU]
Fine.

320
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:24,525
I'll do it myself.

321
00:14:24,608 --> 00:14:26,400
I won't let them take our park!

322
00:14:26,483 --> 00:14:29,317
[YASSAN] If you make a fuss,
the police'll take you away!

323
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,483
We'll be all right.

324
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:32,942
[ANZU]
But, Yassan.

325
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:36,317
We're having a
farewell party later today.

326
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,233
Try to let it go and have fun.

327
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:43,275
A toast!

328
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:45,192
Unfortunately,
we're about to say goodbye

329
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:47,317
to a place we all love.

330
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,192
But here's wishing
for brighter days!

331
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:51,067
Cheers!

332
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,775
[ANZU]
Wait!

333
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:57,525
If we do end up losing the park,

334
00:14:57,608 --> 00:14:59,775
then we can find
a new place together!

335
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,483
All of us, you'll see!

336
00:15:02,983 --> 00:15:04,817
Don't hold your breath, kid.

337
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,275
We'll never find a spot
with enough room.

338
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:08,608
Sure we will!

339
00:15:08,692 --> 00:15:11,358
We'll do it as a team,
like always!

340
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,275
That way, all of us--

341
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:19,192
[GOTO]
Give it a rest, would ya?

342
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:21,942
There won't be any
"all of us" after this!

343
00:15:22,025 --> 00:15:24,983
We can barely take care of
our own selves these days!

344
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:26,733
Now be quiet!

345
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:45,108
[ANZU sobs]

346
00:15:45,192 --> 00:15:47,733
[YASSAN]
Sorry you had to say that, Goto.

347
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:51,233
[GOTO] No, I said it
for selfish reasons.

348
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,817
I felt like she was tellin' me

349
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,025
I couldn't handle things on my
own, and I guess I lashed out.

350
00:15:57,108 --> 00:15:58,692
What that girl doesn't know,

351
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:01,942
is how much
I regret living this way.

352
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:03,650
Dammit!

353
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,733
Hey, Anzu--

354
00:16:31,817 --> 00:16:33,442
[GOTO]
Leave her be.

355
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,692
We said we'd skip the
tough goodbyes, remember?

356
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:45,817
[YASSAN]
Keep her safe, Utako.

357
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,650
Right.

358
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,525
[YASSAN]
Well, Anzu.

359
00:16:50,608 --> 00:16:51,983
See you around.

360
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:53,942
Be good, now.

361
00:17:10,775 --> 00:17:12,692
[SHIGE]
Grown men don't cry, Goto.

362
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:14,608
[GOTO]
Look who's talkin', Shige.

363
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:15,817
I see those tears!

364
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,483
[YASSAN]
Stop it!

365
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:17,525
[GOTO]
Yassan?

366
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:19,108
You too?

367
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:25,108
So you must be Anzu.

368
00:17:25,192 --> 00:17:27,192
[UTAKO]
Mm-hm.

369
00:17:27,275 --> 00:17:30,942
This is Mr. and Mrs. Hayashi,
the owners of Rairaiken.

370
00:17:31,025 --> 00:17:34,108
You'll be living with
us for a while, okay?

371
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:35,275
[MRS. HAYASHI]
Oh, dear.

372
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:36,900
[MR. HAYASHI]
She's been through a lot.

373
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:39,025
[UTAKO] I gotta run.
Thanks again for your help.

374
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:40,358
[MR. HAYASHI]
Sure.

375
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,983
[MR. HAYASHI]
Go on, eat up.

376
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:47,150
[MR. HAYASHI]
Something wrong?

377
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,650
Aren't you hungry?

378
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:53,858
[ANZU] How much did you
pay for all this nice food?

379
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:55,442
Didn't cost us a thing!

380
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:58,775
It's nothing fancy,
but it's pretty good, isn't it?

381
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:08,775
[MR. HAYASHI]
You okay?

382
00:18:08,858 --> 00:18:10,233
[MRS. HAYASHI]
Does it taste bad?

383
00:18:10,317 --> 00:18:12,358
[ANZU]
Nuh-uh. It's great.

384
00:18:12,442 --> 00:18:16,733
Everything's delicious, but...

385
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:20,817
[ANZU]
But...

386
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,025
I'm not sure if I deserve to eat
all this amazing food by myself.

387
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:26,692
I already feel
guilty for trying it!

388
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:28,942
What about the others?

389
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,358
They're out there on their own.

390
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:33,692
Why should I have it?

391
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:37,608
[MRS. HAYASHI]
Anzu.

392
00:18:37,692 --> 00:18:39,942
You shouldn't think
about it that way.

393
00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:42,233
[MR. HAYASHI]
Why don't you go get some rest?

394
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,733
[MRS. HAYASHI] Do you
think she'll like living here?

395
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:49,233
[MR. HAYASHI]
I'm sure she needs to adjust.

396
00:18:49,317 --> 00:18:51,650
Let's just give
her a little time.

397
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,483
Poor thing.

398
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,733
She really is a good girl.

399
00:18:55,817 --> 00:18:59,400
Kids like that make you want
to help 'em as much as you can.

400
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:09,983
New day.

401
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:12,692
Oh yeah, that's right.

402
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:18,192
I guess I don't have to go
digging for cans anymore.

403
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,900
But now I don't know
what to do with myself.

404
00:19:23,442 --> 00:19:25,067
[ANZU]
Yassan.

405
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:29,525
Oh. Hey Anzu!

406
00:19:29,608 --> 00:19:31,442
Good morning!

407
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:32,858
What are you doing?

408
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:34,942
[MRS. HAYASHI] We're about
to start work for the day.

409
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:37,025
You have work?

410
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:39,942
Let me help.

411
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:42,400
It's fine, no need
to trouble yourself.

412
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:43,400
[ANZU]
Nuh-uh.

413
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,067
If I'm not making any money,

414
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,483
then I'm not
earning the food I eat.

415
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,400
That's not how
we do things, dear.

416
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:51,108
Just a sec.

417
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:53,400
Did somebody tell
you that, Anzu?

418
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,150
Yeah, I learned it from Yassan.

419
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:58,150
Maybe we should try that, then.

420
00:19:58,233 --> 00:19:59,358
Are you sure?

421
00:19:59,442 --> 00:20:00,858
Yassan taught
her some good values,

422
00:20:00,942 --> 00:20:02,775
and she's keeping them alive.

423
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:04,150
That's wonderful.

424
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:06,650
Huh? Keeping them alive?

425
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:07,817
[MR. HAYASHI]
Uh-huh.

426
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,358
You carry them
inside of your heart.

427
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,817
It's not just Yassan!

428
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,650
Everybody else
taught me stuff too!

429
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:18,150
Shige taught me how to get
cash for magazines I found.

430
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:21,567
And Hitomi showed me
where all those cans were!

431
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,608
They even helped me learn
how to build a house!

432
00:20:24,692 --> 00:20:25,942
And there's more.

433
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,775
Lots more!

434
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:31,983
Exactly. Nobody can
live without other people.

435
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:35,650
Everyone you meet becomes
part of you in some way.

436
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:38,483
So my friends
are always with me?

437
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:41,275
That's right, and we'll
teach you things, too.

438
00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:43,983
That way you'll have
even more people.

439
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:46,983
Yassan and the others carry you
in their hearts just the same,

440
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:48,858
I'll bet you anything.

441
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:49,983
Really?

442
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:52,275
But I never gave them
anything back.

443
00:20:52,358 --> 00:20:54,650
[MR. HAYASHI]
Of course you did.

444
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:57,900
The memories of the time
you all spent together.

445
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,483
Those are priceless gifts!

446
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:04,067
Wow.

447
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,483
So...

448
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:07,983
[YASSAN]
Hello there, Shige.

449
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,650
Ah. Yassan.

450
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:15,775
You're worried
about Anzu, aren't you?

451
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,942
Oh, it's that obvious?

452
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:20,275
When we left
in a hurry like that,

453
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:22,608
I thought we were
doing right by her.

454
00:21:22,692 --> 00:21:25,483
But after all the wrong turns
we've made in the past.

455
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:28,233
I'm wondering if that
was another mistake.

456
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:30,150
[SHIGE]
Well, think about it this way.

457
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:31,692
Huh?

458
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:34,775
We've got someone who's gonna
cry for us when we're gone,

459
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:38,150
so we'd better keep our
heads up a little longer.

460
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,692
[ANZU] Does that mean--they're
not alone either?

461
00:21:45,775 --> 00:21:46,942
[MR. HAYASHI]
Never.

462
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:49,442
You're right there with them.

463
00:21:51,942 --> 00:21:58,317
[ANZU sobs]

464
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,983
Good.

465
00:22:00,608 --> 00:22:02,275
[MRS. HAYASHI]
Oh my, I need a tissue.

466
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:04,067
[MR. HAYASHI]
Get me one, too.

467
00:22:06,108 --> 00:22:07,608
[MR. HAYASHI]
Now, now.

468
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:11,025
You can't get any work
done if you're crying.

469
00:22:11,108 --> 00:22:14,108
[ANZU sobs]
'Kay.

470
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:50,400
[NITTA] Next time,
"Anzu Is a Greeter Now."
