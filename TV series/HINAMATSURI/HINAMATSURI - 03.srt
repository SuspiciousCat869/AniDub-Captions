161
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:09,358
Uh-oh, don't look now,
Boss, but it looks like

162
00:09:09,442 --> 00:09:12,358
there's somebody tryin'
to chase us down.

163
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:18,650
[NITTA]
Stop the car.

164
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:24,442
What's up?

165
00:09:24,525 --> 00:09:27,567
Listen, about
what I said before.

166
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:29,775
[ANZU]
I'm sorry.

167
00:09:34,983 --> 00:09:37,108
So could I please have, um...

168
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:38,650
The cash?

169
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:39,817
[ANZU]
Mm-hm.

170
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,192
What caused you
to change your mind?

171
00:09:42,275 --> 00:09:44,150
[ANZU]
Uh.

172
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:45,650
Eh, what's the difference?

173
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:47,150
I'll give it to ya.

174
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:50,983
I don't know what you plan
to spend it on, but it's yours.

175
00:09:57,692 --> 00:09:59,483
[ANZU]
Thank you, sir!

176
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:11,442
She gonna keep bowing
in the street all day or what?

177
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:17,483
This'll help us a lot!

178
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,025
All of us!

179
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:21,775
[UTAKO]
You're coming with me, thief.

180
00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:23,858
[ANZU] No, look, it's okay,
I have money now.

181
00:10:23,942 --> 00:10:26,317
I don't need to steal anymore!

182
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,692
[UTAKO]
Let's see.

183
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:31,650
Our total losses were
39 thousand, 340 yen, so...

184
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:33,108
Here's your change.

185
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:34,400
We're letting you
off the hook this time,

186
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:37,150
so you better not do it again.

187
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:43,900
[YASSAN] Now, now,
no reason to be that upset.

188
00:10:43,983 --> 00:10:46,483
Why not? It's all gone.

189
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:47,942
You paid your debt.

190
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:50,525
Don't you think that
counts for something?

191
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,608
[ANZU]
But...

192
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,650
[GOTO]
He's right, kid, don't sweat it.

193
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,400
Besides, if we had any money,

194
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:58,817
we'd spend it all
on more alcohol.

195
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,692
Think of it as a fresh start.

196
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:03,942
You may be broke, but you
don't owe the world a thing.

197
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:17,025
[HITOMI]
I'm Hitomi Mishima.

198
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:19,025
It's nice to meet you.

199
00:11:19,108 --> 00:11:20,275
What ritual takes place

200
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:22,733
in some areas of Akita
during New Year's Eve?

201
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:23,858
[HITOMI]
The Namahage?

202
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:25,317
Yes, that's correct.

203
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,442
[HITOMI] I don't mean
to brag or anything,

204
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:31,483
but I'm a super-high achiever
when it comes to academics.

205
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:34,150
That's just who I am
in the daytime though.

206
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:37,483
You see, I have a little secret.

207
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:42,067
By night, I assume my secret
identity as a bartender!

208
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:47,108
I'm not really sure how
this happened, though.

209
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:48,400
Omigod, Hitomi,

210
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:50,733
I can't believe how
perfect you look in that!

211
00:11:50,817 --> 00:11:52,150
Uh, thank you.

212
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:54,442
Are you ready to start
slingin' those cocktails, kiddo?

213
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:55,858
[HITOMI]
Wait, what do you mean?

214
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:57,317
Isn't it obvious?

215
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,900
What do you think I want you
to put on the outfit for?

216
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:01,317
[HITOMI] All you told me
to do was try it on!

217
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,942
[UTAKO] This job pays
15 hundred yen per hour!

218
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:07,108
No other middle schooler
alive makes that much money!

219
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:09,275
That's not a convincing
argument, since middle schoolers

220
00:12:09,358 --> 00:12:12,817
aren't even allowed
to have jobs.

221
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,692
[sighs]
Time for Plan B.

222
00:12:17,108 --> 00:12:18,317
Look what I've got.

223
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,733
Be a shame if your
school saw it, huh?

224
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:24,275
[gasps]

225
00:12:25,442 --> 00:12:28,608
Just cooperate and we
shouldn't have any problems.

226
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:29,983
Huh?

227
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:31,442
Isn't it obvious?

228
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:32,858
What do you think I want you
to put on the outfit for?

229
00:12:32,942 --> 00:12:34,983
[UTAKO]
What?

230
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:37,108
I had a bad feeling
about that conversation,

231
00:12:37,192 --> 00:12:38,358
so I recorded it!

232
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:40,942
You're a smart girl,
I'll give you that much.

233
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:42,733
With all the messes
I'm getting into lately,

234
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:43,942
I kinda have to be.

235
00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:46,317
Actually, let's forget it.

236
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,025
What do you say
we delete our data?

237
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:50,858
That way, we'll have
nothing to worry about.

238
00:12:50,942 --> 00:12:52,733
[HITOMI]
You won't pressure me anymore?

239
00:12:52,817 --> 00:12:55,275
Never again,
dear, and I apologize.

240
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,983
Hm... Sure.

241
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,942
And, go!

242
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:05,983
[sighs]
I'm gonna change clothes now--

243
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:09,233
[UTAKO]
Hmmm...

244
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:10,608
Foolish girl!

245
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:13,525
I've already uploaded
the picture to my computer!

246
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:16,025
One daiquiri.

247
00:13:16,108 --> 00:13:18,942
So thanks to blackmail
and the power of technology,

248
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:21,900
I have a job.

249
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,358
You like your drink, Dad?

250
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:25,525
It's great.

251
00:13:25,608 --> 00:13:27,858
She makes it even
better than Utako does!

252
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:28,983
[HITOMI]
Thank you so much, sir.

253
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:31,150
[UTAKO laughs]

254
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:32,900
[SABU]
You're scaring me.

255
00:13:32,983 --> 00:13:35,483
[MATSUTANI] It's time to head
home now, Vice Principal.

256
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:38,400
[VICE PRINCIPAL] Eh, come on,
Matsutani, have a little fun.

257
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:40,150
The night's just
gettin' started!

258
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:41,650
I know a good bar near here.

259
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,150
You'll make yourself sick, sir.

260
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:44,567
I wanna go home.

261
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,275
I'd hate for you
to leave so soon

262
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,983
since I was planning
on lobbying for you

263
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:49,858
to be lead teacher next year.

264
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:52,150
Let's go drink
till we throw up.

265
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:54,858
Oh. Welcome, gentleme--

266
00:13:54,942 --> 00:13:56,275
[shrieks]

267
00:13:56,358 --> 00:13:57,650
[VICE PRINCIPAL]
Owwie!

268
00:13:57,733 --> 00:13:59,275
[HITOMI]
Mr. Matsutani!

269
00:13:59,358 --> 00:14:01,150
I can't let him see me here!

270
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:03,317
What should I do?

271
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,233
[SABU]
Hmm?

272
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:05,400
You okay, Hitomi?

273
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:08,275
Um. My teacher just
walked in the door.

274
00:14:08,358 --> 00:14:09,692
I'm so dead!

275
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:10,817
[SABU]
Ehh...

276
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,025
That's not a big deal.

277
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:12,858
It's fine.

278
00:14:12,942 --> 00:14:14,567
Gimme a martini.

279
00:14:15,483 --> 00:14:17,233
This'll be interesting.

280
00:14:17,317 --> 00:14:19,358
[HITOMI]
What's with these people?

281
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,733
Excuse me, miss,
we'd like to order.

282
00:14:20,817 --> 00:14:22,733
Ah, be right with you!

283
00:14:23,942 --> 00:14:25,483
Sorry for the wait.

284
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:26,900
Um...

285
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:28,567
Huh?

286
00:14:33,108 --> 00:14:34,942
[MATSUTANI]
Whoa, she's really young!

287
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:38,358
Wait, I could swear I've seen
this girl somewhere before.

288
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:45,358
Mishima? Mi. Mi. Mi.

289
00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:47,733
Million dollar for me, please.

290
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:49,442
Snap out of it, Matsutani!

291
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:52,567
You must be drunk,
that can't be the same girl!

292
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,233
One of your best students
moonlighting as a bartender?

293
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:56,817
Come on, that's impossible!

294
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,525
[HITOMI]
I have to calm down!

295
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,567
He totally recognizes me.

296
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,525
I just know it!

297
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:06,608
Is somethin' botherin' you?

298
00:15:06,692 --> 00:15:08,567
Um, it's nothing to worry about.

299
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,442
It's just he bartender who took
my order a minute ago happens

300
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:14,108
to look a lot like one
of the students in my class.

301
00:15:14,192 --> 00:15:15,983
You better hope it isn't her.

302
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:19,150
Because if it is, you can kiss
that lead teacher title goodbye.

303
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:20,858
Well, she doesn't
look that much like her.

304
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:24,025
Only if you squint one eye
and close the other.

305
00:15:24,108 --> 00:15:26,317
Either way, miss,
you really do look like

306
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,983
you could be a
middle school student.

307
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:29,692
[TANAKA]
Ha! Hey, pal.

308
00:15:29,775 --> 00:15:31,775
You should try
one of her drinks.

309
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:33,442
No kid could make 'em that good.

310
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:35,650
Hitomi's a living legend!

311
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:37,192
[MATSUTANI]
Pretty sure Mishima's full name

312
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:39,233
is Hitomi Mishima.

313
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:42,025
[HITOMI]
Sabu, don't blow my cover!

314
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,942
[MATSUTANI]
Fine, I'll try it.

315
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:45,192
But I've been logging
a lot of hours

316
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:48,483
in bars since my college days.

317
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:50,775
I know what I like.

318
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,067
That's your cue, Hitomi.

319
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,858
Show him.

320
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:56,525
Okay.

321
00:16:17,358 --> 00:16:19,358
[HITOMI]
Your million dollar.

322
00:16:29,483 --> 00:16:31,775
[MATSUTANI]
It's magnificent.

323
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,650
Perfectly shaken!

324
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:34,650
Are you satisfied?

325
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:36,067
[MATSUTANI]
No. Not yet.

326
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,025
I still haven't seen her stir.

327
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:39,567
Why doesn't she have
callouses on her hands

328
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,317
from working with bar spoons?

329
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,817
She's got shaking skills,

330
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,733
but there's no way she can
stir like an adult bartender.

331
00:16:45,817 --> 00:16:49,275
[laughter]

332
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:50,150
Another drink?

333
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:52,400
What would you like?

334
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:55,692
All right!
Make me a bartender.

335
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,025
One bartender.

336
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:15,025
Wow.

337
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:17,192
Amazing.

338
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:18,733
Such rare talent.

339
00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:21,650
The best bars in Ginza don't
have staff as good as you are!

340
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:24,317
But why don't you have
any bar spoon callouses?

341
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,775
[HITOMI]
Um, well...

342
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:29,567
I guess I worked so hard,
they just wore off.

343
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,233
[MATSUTANI]
That's dedication!

344
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,067
[MATSUTANI laughs]

345
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,025
They're right, no middle
schooler could do this.

346
00:17:37,108 --> 00:17:38,608
You've impressed me.

347
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:39,983
Thank you so much.

348
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:42,025
I'll be back soon.

349
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:46,900
Heh. And with that,
she's got one more convert.

350
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:56,108
[HITOMI]
P.S., the bank account I started

351
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:59,442
without telling my parents
is growing crazy fast.

352
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:02,442
It's almost scary
how rich I am now.

353
00:18:07,942 --> 00:18:11,233
[HINA] No fair, you have
one more meatball than me.

354
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:12,733
Mine.

355
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:14,942
[NITTA sips]

356
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:19,025
So, hey, the other day,
I ran into Anzu.

357
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:22,942
How would you like to try living
on the streets like her?

358
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:24,358
It just got me thinking

359
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:27,317
maybe I ought to let Anzu
live here instead of you.

360
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,400
[NITTA laughs]

361
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:31,233
How was it?

362
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:33,025
[ANZU]
Delicious!

363
00:18:33,108 --> 00:18:34,775
Let's go there again, okay?

364
00:18:34,858 --> 00:18:37,608
Already planning next time, huh?

365
00:18:37,692 --> 00:18:39,025
Wait. Alms for the poor?

366
00:18:39,108 --> 00:18:40,233
[ANZU]
Ooh, let's go get some dessert!

367
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:41,317
[HINA]
I'm starving.

368
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,567
[NITTA]
My sweet girl has a sweet to--?

369
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,525
Nitta, you have one less
meatball than I do.

370
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:55,067
[NITTA] Yeah, I didn't want
to hear you complain.

371
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,358
Here. You take the extra one.

372
00:18:57,442 --> 00:18:59,108
Huh?

373
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,692
[NITTA]
I have a meeting, so uh...

374
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:06,358
Don't follow me.

375
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:07,983
[HINA]
Have a good day.

376
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:21,817
Right!

377
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,942
Whoa. What happened?

378
00:19:24,025 --> 00:19:25,733
Welcome home, Nitta.

379
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:27,900
[NITTA]
Hina! Did you do all this?

380
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:28,608
No.

381
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:30,525
No, that's impossible.

382
00:19:30,608 --> 00:19:31,608
You couldn't have.

383
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:32,650
I did do it.

384
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:36,150
[NITTA sobs]

385
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:37,650
[HINA]
You're crying.

386
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:39,608
Did I make you sad, Nitta?

387
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:42,733
[NITTA] Just because
I'm crying doesn't mean I'm sad.

388
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:46,025
Sometimes I cry happy tears!

389
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:58,942
Yaaaaaay.

390
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:21,025
Ah, it's beautiful.

391
00:20:21,108 --> 00:20:24,025
Listen, I don't want to have
to replace another one of these.

392
00:20:24,108 --> 00:20:26,817
You're gonna be in a world
of trouble if you break it.

393
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:35,442
[HINA] Oh well,
I can deal with this later.

394
00:20:47,025 --> 00:20:48,483
[HINA]
Uh, oh.

395
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:53,067
[HINA] All this cleaning's
making me thirsty.

396
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:03,567
[HINA]
Rewards?

397
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,483
Well, I have worked hard today.

398
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,900
This might be meant for dinner.

399
00:21:08,983 --> 00:21:11,233
I'll just have a few bites.

400
00:21:13,817 --> 00:21:15,650
[HINA]
It's not as tasty as usual.

401
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:17,983
[NITTA]
Hmm...

402
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:19,358
[BOSS]
What's wrong, Nitta?

403
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:20,650
[NITTA]
Nothing, it's just...

404
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,400
...Hina's acting weird today.

405
00:21:22,483 --> 00:21:24,608
She gave me the bigger
share of food at breakfast,

406
00:21:24,692 --> 00:21:28,108
and then she came to the door
to see me off when I left.

407
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,858
I'm sure that just means
your little Hina's growing up.

408
00:21:30,942 --> 00:21:32,567
[NITTA]
You think that's it?

409
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,275
Give her a special treat
when you get back home.

410
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:36,608
Funny you should say that,

411
00:21:36,692 --> 00:21:39,067
I was keeping some
salmon roe to reward her with,

412
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,983
but she never did
anything to earn it,

413
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,442
so it ended up going bad.

414
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:58,858
Uh-oh, what's happening.

415
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:03,067
Ugh, my tummy feels weird.

416
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,025
Owwie.

417
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:11,567
I guess there doesn't
always have to

418
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,858
be a reason to give her a treat.

419
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:15,900
I'm home!

420
00:23:47,942 --> 00:23:51,400
[HITOMI] Next time,
"Disownment Rock n' Roll Fever."
