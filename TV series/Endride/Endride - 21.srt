1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,000
So when you say you're a
scientist, what does it mean?

2
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:15,250
Well, you see,

3
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:18,083
I work to discover new
ways of helping people

4
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:22,416
and to bring us all a little
closer to a better future.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,791
That sounds awesome, Dad!

6
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,166
You think so? I do, too.

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,833
Thing is, for me to do it
there must be sacrifice.

8
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,125
Wait, no.

9
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:36,375
What do you mean? Please, don't.

10
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,375
[SHUN gasps]

11
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,708
[SHUN]
Why'd you do it?

12
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,541
Why, Dad?

13
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,750
[MAKIKO]
Shun! It's time to eat!

14
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,416
Shun?

15
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,458
I'm such a fool.

16
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:42,708
I did all of these things
out of love but I hurt him.

17
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:46,625
I think some part of me
knew this would happen.

18
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,791
Well, there's no point
letting it get cold.

19
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,625
Hey, Shun. Makiko worked
hard on this meal.

20
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,541
You should eat it.

21
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:10,416
[SHUN] Thanks. If that's all
you came for, then get out.

22
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,666
I'll be happy to leave

23
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,666
just as soon as I see
you finish your meal.

24
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:18,750
[SHUN]
Emilio.

25
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,333
What's up?

26
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,833
[SHUN]
It's funny.

27
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:24,875
I could never understand why
you wanted to kill Delzaine.

28
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,708
I knew you were mad, but...

29
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,875
The idea of hating the man who
raised you enough to kill him--

30
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,916
It seemed so horrible.

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,166
I get it now, though. Now that
my father's the monster.

32
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,625
I know exactly how you felt.

33
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:43,291
Knowing all the things he's
done, the lies he's told.

34
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,500
It's screwing with my head.

35
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,666
I'm not any different.

36
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,708
You are different.

37
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,750
[SHUN]
Yeah, how?

38
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,541
Stop thinking about it and eat.

39
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,208
Your mother is an
exceptional cook.

40
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:01,875
She puts the best chefs
in my castle to shame.

41
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,583
[DEMETRIO]
That from Guidoro?

42
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,291
[GRADIDO]
Yeah.

43
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,250
A basic field report.

44
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,791
Complete with a
list of complaints

45
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,541
about his new comrades.

46
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,750
Well, I suppose that's
to be expected.

47
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,291
With any luck they'll learn
to get along eventually.

48
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:39,041
Ha. We can hope. He said
they'd found Ibelda's trail.

49
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,458
They're closing in on him.

50
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,583
That so?

51
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,708
[ALICIA] Demetrio!
Hey! We've got news!

52
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,250
[ALICIA panting]

53
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,208
I think we've figured out what
happened to Shun and Emilio!

54
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,541
Let's hear it.

55
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,291
We're pretty sure the
only place they could've

56
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,208
ended up is in the
castle's dungeon.

57
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,375
You sure?

58
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,916
[RALPH] Yeah. Talked to
one of the guards.

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,458
He saw them heading that way
before they disappeared.

60
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,208
And there's no one in the castle
who's seen either of them since.

61
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,000
I think Shun said
the dungeons are where

62
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,708
he first showed up
when he came here.

63
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,666
[chirps]

64
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,208
Let's have the men take
another look down there.

65
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,333
[RALPH]
Right!

66
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,708
[GRADIDO]
I'll see if I can help, too.

67
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:12,500
Good, thanks.

68
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,250
[ELJUIA]
Demetrio.

69
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,708
[DEMETRIO]
What is it?

70
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:16,958
With your leave,

71
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,916
there's something I'd
like to look into alone.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,208
It pertains to the
end of the world.

73
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,583
What do you mean?

74
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,208
[ELJUIA] I had another
vision this morning.

75
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,541
Much like the one that
came to me near Babel.

76
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:29,916
Still think it has to do

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
with the disappearance
of Warp Particles?

78
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,041
[ELJUIA]
Yes. I confess I've been afraid.

79
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,916
I've yet to truly
push my ability

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,291
to its fullest potential.

81
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:41,125
But the end is coming,
whether I look or not.

82
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,791
Something has caused
this imbalance,

83
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,333
and I have to find out what.

84
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,416
[BOTH gasp]

85
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,875
The letters are starting
to show again!

86
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,375
I thought this might work.

87
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,666
Excellent thinking, Joseph.

88
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,041
Thanks, sir. But I can actually
trace this idea back to you.

89
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,750
After all, it was your thesis
that our eyes don't have

90
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,875
the capability to see every
single wavelength of light.

91
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,500
That's how I knew that
these pages might have

92
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,750
more to show than we thought,
and from there it was just

93
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:14,666
a matter of finding the right...

94
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,625
We both saw! You did great.

95
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,500
I'm glad Rodney here chose to
keep these dilapidated books,

96
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,041
although before now I couldn't
have guessed why he would.

97
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,291
It would appear that my
propensity for hoarding

98
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,250
has finally paid off.

99
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,583
[PASCAL]
Well. Let's get to work.

100
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,250
[EMILIO] Just call!
I have to speak with him.

101
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,208
[RECEPTION 21A]
He's out right now.

102
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,625
Can I take a message for you?

103
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,041
You're lying, and I know it!

104
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,916
Just listen!

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,500
You're making folks
uncomfortable.

106
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,291
I have to ask you to leave.

107
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,750
You don't get it! I have to--

108
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,541
What are you doing? Unhand me!

109
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,333
I have to see Asanaga!

110
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,750
[ASANAGA]
What's all this commotion?

111
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,500
You are here.

112
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,000
You're alone.

113
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,500
It seems strange that you
would come here without Shun.

114
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,500
He's the subject I wanted
us to talk about.

115
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:04,833
[ASANAGA] Hm. Please escort
the young man to my office.

116
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:05,916
[gasps]

117
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,583
[ASANAGA]
Sorry, Emilio.

118
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,625
I wish that holding you at
gunpoint weren't necessary.

119
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,916
But I'm not entirely convinced
you didn't come here to kill me.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,791
No. I didn't.

121
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,916
Although you have given me
more than enough reason.

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,125
Well, then what do you want?

123
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:27,166
What's important enough to
make you take such a risk?

124
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,041
I have a question. What
could've possibly driven you

125
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,916
to murder my father?
He get in your way?

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,875
[ASANAGA] Alzerm getting
in my way was part of it.

127
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:38,166
However, it was far from
my primary consideration.

128
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,833
[ASANAGA] I could have left him
alive easily, if I'd cared to.

129
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,333
[EMILIO growls]

130
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,916
[ASANAGA]
But I wanted to kill him

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,041
because he was
unfit to be king.

132
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,416
What?

133
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,625
[ASANAGA] He was a small-minded
creature of avarice.

134
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,458
Easy to persuade. And a tyrant.

135
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,375
How many Zoozians could have
avoided enslavement if they

136
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,666
hadn't been captured by your
father's military conquests.

137
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,875
[EMILIO gasps]

138
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,583
[ASANAGA] Did you not know?
To be honest,

139
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,958
I'd expected that once
Delzaine became king,

140
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,750
Endora would see a few
improvements.

141
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,291
[EMILIO]
You're... lying.

142
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:13,208
[ASANAGA] If I recall, you said
that he died protecting you.

143
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,000
[EMILIO]
One more question.

144
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,458
What is it?

145
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,083
Do you love your son?

146
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,166
Even though you never
should have had him.

147
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,208
[ASANAGA]
Yes. I do.

148
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,625
What I said before was
wrong. Shun is my son.

149
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,041
Even if we share no
blood, I raised him.

150
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,916
I've loved him from the start.

151
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,666
[EMILIO gasps]

152
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,125
That's why you're alive.

153
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:38,333
Because killing you would
upset Shun. And I need him.

154
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,750
I need him to understand
what I'm doing.

155
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:44,208
Every last thing I've built
here, I built for my family.

156
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,416
I will not see it fractured.

157
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,041
Shun is precious to me.

158
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:51,833
He's my son, and nothing
can replace him.

159

Provided that you
stay out of my way,

160
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,541
I'll have no reason to harm you.

161
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,791
But if you try something
stupid. Well...

162
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,375
[SHUN]
Uh.

163
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,541
So do you plan to sulk
in here forever?

164
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,083
[SHUN]
Well no, but...

165
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,708
[EMILIO] I went to your father's
office and spoke with him.

166
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,958
You what? He almost
killed you earlier.

167
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,041
What the heck were you thinking?
And what did you say to him?

168
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,375
I needed to confirm
a few things.

169
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,416
What kind of things?

170
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,125
[EMILIO] I asked him if
he actually loves you,

171
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,166
and he told me that
he does indeed.

172
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,375
[gasps]

173
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,208
[EMILIO] He took back
what he said before.

174
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,166
Said blood aside,
you are his son.

175
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,458
And that everything he's done,
he did for you: for his family.

176
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,083
Yeah?

177
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,666
[EMILIO]
Look.

178
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,708
When I wanted Delzaine dead, you
said I should speak with him.

179
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,083
Emilio...

180
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,958
But I had allowed myself to
be blinded by an anger

181
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,708
borne of ignorance.

182
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,083
I wasted my chance.

183
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,708
Shun, do not make my mistake.
You'll regret it.

184
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:11,083
[EMILIO] Go to Asanaga.
Go to your father and talk.

185
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,916
Hear what he has to say,
and make a choice.

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,958
Don't think about my father.
Don't worry about me.

187
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:20,958
Decide what you want for
yourself, and go from there.

188
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,583
All right.

189
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,375
If I don't go talk to him
then nothing will change.

190
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,541
And I can't stand the way
that I feel right now, so...

191
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,916
Thanks for the advice, Emilio.

192
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,791
I've done nothing
worthy of gratitude.

193
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:40,125
[SHUN laughs]
Give yourself some credit.

194
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,333
I'm guessing you have news,
since you called us all here.

195
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,541
We've made a very
significant discovery.

196
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,083
I wanted to update everyone.

197
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,333
Though Eljuia seems
to be missing.

198
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,708
He's closed himself
off in his room.

199
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:11,041
Doing something between
meditation and a psychic ritual.

200
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,333
He asked us not to
interrupt him,

201
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,083
but I don't think he
has food in there.

202
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,375
Do you think he'll be okay?

203
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,625
[chrips]

204
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,041
He'll be fine.

205
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,291
We just have to trust that
he knows what he's doing.

206
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,125
Anyway. What do you have for us?

207
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,083
Oh, right. To put it plainly,

208
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,125
we've discovered a
new medium for travel

209
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,958
between Endora
and the surface.

210
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,541
[ALL gasp]

211
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:35,666
I think it extremely likely that
this is what landed Shun here.

212
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:48,000
[SHUN] That building. It used
to be where my dad worked.

213
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,750
His whole business started
with that little workshop.

214
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:54,875
Way back then he'd actually take
me to work with him sometimes.

215
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,958
Sorry about that. The client
had a lot of questions.

216
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,958
[SHUN]
Mm-mm. Don't worry 'bout me.

217
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,833
I know you only work this
hard cause you're gonna

218
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,041
make things better
for everybody, so...

219
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,166
[ASANAGA] You're a good boy,
Shun. Ready to go?

220
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,333
It's time.

221
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,958
We've got another
doctor's appointment.

222
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,458
Aw. Could we skip
just this once?

223
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,708
We can't if we want you
to stay healthy, son.

224
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,541
[EMILIO] Doesn't look like
this place is still in use.

225
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,666
[SHUN] No. The equipment Dad
was able to afford back then

226
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,083
can't even compare to what
he has in the tower now.

227
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:36,708
I see. But regardless,
he's left this place intact.

228
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,666
Makes me wonder if it
doesn't hold some kind

229
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,625
of sentimental value for him.

230
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,500
[ASANAGA]
Shun. Sorry to keep you waiting.

231
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,666
[gasps]

232
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,333
I thought we'd be alone.

233
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,083
I assure you I won't interrupt,
so feel free to pretend

234
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,833
I'm not here. I only
came to support Shun.

235
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,333
[ASANAGA]
You don't look well, Shun.

236
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:03,041
It was never my intention
to cause you any pain.

237
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't know what I'm
supposed to think about

238
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,500
any of this stuff.

239
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,041
But I... I know
I don't hate you.

240
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,708
You annoy me sometimes.

241
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,625
Like when you work straight
through your own birthday, but

242
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,708
I still can't accept
that you're a killer.

243
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,791
You were such a kind person.
Why would you do this?

244
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,291
Why would you destroy a country?

245
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,958
All right. Fine. I'll explain.

246
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:28,458
[gasps]

247
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,541
[gasping]

248
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,166
Wait. That's...

249
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,000
[ASANAGA]
It's called a Parinblue.

250
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,500
They're the only objects I
know of that allow transit

251
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,625
between Endora and here.

252
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,083
Your mother found them.

253
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,000
The last traces of a culture
far greater than our own.

254
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,708
[PASCAL] Endora's creation
is shrouded in myth.

255
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,458
There are legends and fables
which suggest that our world

256
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,500
was fashioned deliberately
by superior beings,

257
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,625
come from a far distant planet.

258
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,083
Yeah, I remember my parents
telling stories like that

259
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,083
back when I was little.

260
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,666
[FALARION chirps]

261
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,541
[PASCAL] Mm. Apparently, those
makers left a few things behind.

262
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,291
These were called Parinblue.

263
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,541
They're quite rare, of course.
When the link between Endora

264
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:13,125
and the surface was severed, the
majority of them were broken.

265
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,791
They bond to the hearts
of their owners.

266
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,916
To make use of one you'd have
to feed it a strong emotion.

267
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,625
It seems that any would do.

268
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:20,500
Anger.

269
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,333
Fear.

270
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,416
Even passionate curiosity.

271
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,666
Given the appropriate
stimuli, it takes the body

272
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,916
and disassembles it into
countless particles.

273
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,291
Then it guides those particles
across the divi--

274
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,541
Let's spare them
the technicalities.

275
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,833
The point is,
if Shun came to Endora

276
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,666
through the power of
one of these devices,

277
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,375
well, that gives us
a pretty good idea

278
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,541
of where he and
Emilio vanished to.

279
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:41,791
[ALICIA]
So they're on the surface,

280
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,333
but they can still
come back, right?

281
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,625
[PASCAL] As long as they've kept
possession of the Parinblue,

282
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,333
yes, it should be possible.

283
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,791
Although I can't really
say that with certainty.

284
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,291
Hold on.

285
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,083
If we're to believe that Shun
had one of these Parinblue

286
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,958
this whole time, then why
has he never mentioned it?

287
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,541
I wouldn't take him for
the kind to keep a secret.

288
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,625
It's possible that he possessed
it without knowing.

289
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,833
My guess would be that the
Parinblue's been inside of him.

290
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,625
You're saying that I
have one in my chest?

291
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,083
[ASANAGA] The Parinblue you
found in my office didn't just

292
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:13,875
transport you to Endora.
It bound itself to you.

293
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,125
It can grant you passage between
our worlds at any time.

294
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,875
I've spent the majority of
my adult life studying

295
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,833
the ebb and flow of this
world beneath our own.

296
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,041
Through that work, I discovered
something great.

297
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,166
An energy source
unique to Endora.

298
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,041
More plentiful than
anything the surface had.

299
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,416
Warp Particles?

300
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,875
[ASANAGA]
That's right.

301
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,791
I realized that if I could
harness them on the surface,

302
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,833
I could improve the
lives of millions.

303
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:40,916
Exactly like we talked about
when you were a child.

304
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
When I went to Endora,
I went with that purpose.

305
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,208
To obtain Warp Particles
for my people,

306
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,875
through whatever
means were needed.

307
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,250
How is that enough to
make killing okay?

308
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,416
This was hardly the first time
that a contest over resources

309
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,833
ended in bloodshed.

310
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,416
Wars have been fought over
things far less valuable.

311
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,208
Just look at what
we've achieved.

312
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,500
The siphoning of Endora's
Warp Particles

313
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,333
is one of the main factors
that have allowed

314
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,875
this nation to
prosper as it has, Shun.

315
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,375
I haven't hoarded this power.
I've given it almost freely.

316
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,250
As a result, the specter of
pollution is on the decline,

317
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:16,250
our production is up, the
average person here lives well.

318
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,125
These are good things, son.

319
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,500
You think the loss
of one life compares?

320
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,250
How? Even if it destroys
their whole country.

321
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,333
Once I can scale what I've done
here to the rest of our world,

322
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,875
it will have been for
the greater good.

323
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,250
Dad...

324
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,000
[ASANAGA] I'll never regret
what I've done.

325
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,625
Because that's what
it took to save you.

326
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,000
[gasps]

327
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,875
[ASANAGA] Your Endra father gave
you to me because you were sick

328
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,583
from a pandemic that was
untreatable in Endora.

329
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,500
Yeah, I... I heard.

330
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,916
If you hadn't taken me
to a hospital up here,

331
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,708
I probably wouldn't be alive.

332
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,125
[ASANAGA] It took money
to pay for those treatments.

333
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,250
Even after they'd
officially cured you,

334
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,291
your body was still so weak.

335
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,750
You were in the hospital
as often as you weren't.

336
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,541
And I'm grateful.

337
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,833
[ASANAGA] If it weren't for the
massively successful work

338
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,041
I've done with Warp Particles,

339
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,583
I never could have
paid those bills.

340
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:20,083
I did what I had to.
And you're still here.

341
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,791
[SHUN]
But what about Endora?

342
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,833
Shun, you're too kind a
person for your own good.

343
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,291
There's no point in lamenting
what's as good as done.

344
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,333
Endora will soon die, forget it.

345
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,458
[SHUN gasps]

346
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,500
Its Warp Particles
are nearly depleted.

347
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,916
It won't be long before
there are too few remaining

348
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,666
and the world in its current
form won't be sustainable.

349
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,791
[BOTH gasp]

350
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,000
[ASANAGA]
For all practical purposes,

351
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,166
you could pretend that
it never existed.

352
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,500
Hey. Wait a sec!

353
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:45,666
[ASANAGA] What is it?

354
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,666
You're acting like
this is inevitable.

355
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,916
But that isn't true.

356
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,666
You're the one doing
this, aren't you?

357
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,583
I am.

358
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,750
Well then put an end to it!

359
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,750
[ASANAGA] What are you talking
about? I could never stop.

360
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:57,833
And why not?

361
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,666
Because of everything
I've told you.

362
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,583
Warp Particles have
enabled me to perform

363
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,416
near miracles on the surface.
Why would I stop

364
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,791
the work that's improved
millions of people's lives?

365
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,625
It's like the people of Endora

366
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,166
don't even really count as
human beings in your mind.

367
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,208
Uh. Yes. That's right.

368
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,250
[gasps]

369
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,750
[ASANAGA] Endora served
to advance humanity

370
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,291
by leaps and bounds.

371
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,875
It's a good cause.

372
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:26,625
And when I'm gone, you will
ensure that its legacy endures.

373
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,541
But...

374
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,416
We have nothing to worry about.

375
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,375
Before our supply runs out,
I'll have perfected a system

376
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,416
that will allow Warp
Particles to replicate

377
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,750
even on the surface.

378
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,375
After Endora has collapsed,

379
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:41,166
we'll still be able to mine it
for a few years. Ample time.

380
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,791
I won't let you!

381
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,208
What's that?

382
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,500
If you think conveniences
are worth people's lives,

383
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,500
then you've lost your mind.

384
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,458
You weren't in Endora that long.

385
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,291
Have you really
grown so attached?

386
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,375
I suppose it's natural to love
the place where you were born.

387
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,166
It's hard to admit,
but in the end,

388
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,375
it would seem that you
do belong to Endora.

389
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,083
[SHUN gasps]

390
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,625
[EMILIO gasps]

391
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:06,041
[ASANAGA] I can't let anyone
hold me back. Not even you, Son.

392
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,625
So if you won't work with me,

393
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,166
then at the very least
get out of my way.

394
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,041
I would like to avoid
having to kill you.

395
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,416
[EMILIO]
Enough, Asanaga!

396
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,708
[ASANAGA]
Damn it!

397
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,083
You bastard!

398
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,375
Emilio!

399
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,625
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

400
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:30,791
[ASANAGA laughs]
I would never shoot you, Shun.

401
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,625
You're my darling boy.

402
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,666
You don't have to do this, Dad!

403
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,833
Are you the reason why my
son has turned against me?

404
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,416
How annoying.

405
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,416
Just when everything
was perfect!

406
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,333
If you hadn't shown up
and poisoned him

407
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,166
with your friendship, he would
be laughing at my side!

408
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,791
The hell he would have.

409
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,166
Given the circumstances,

410
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,875
I'd recommend that you
keep your mouth shut tight.

411
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:56,500
You're a nuisance. You ruined
him. You've destroyed my family!

412
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:02,375
[SHUN] Leave him alone!

413
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,208
[ASANAGA]
Uh.

414
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:19,291

Felix, I need you to
hold still, all right?

418
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:36,083
Get out of my way!

419
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,666
There're too many of them!

420
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,083
We can't keep them
off you much longer.

421
