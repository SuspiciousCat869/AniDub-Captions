1
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:08,875
[gunshot]

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,750
[SHUN] The hell, Dad.
Why did you do that?

3
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,833
Why would you say
I'm not your son?

4
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,875
The truth can be
an ugly thing.

5
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:23,250
We'll discuss this more once
I've put our prince here

6
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,916
to sleep. I'll make it quick.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Just like I did with his father.

8
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,416
[EMILIO]
What?

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,666
[ASANAGA] Alzerm was an arrogant
fool, but Delzaine...

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,375
I think he knew
what I was planning.

11
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:37,208
[EMILIO]
So then, you admit it.

12
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,541
[ASANAGA] Yes, I killed
your brute of a father.

13
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,416
And I'd do it again.

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,875
There's no way...

15
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:45,000
Damn you!

16
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:45,958
Uh!

17
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,875
What? My Warp Relic!

18
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:50,416
[ASANAGA]
Heh, heh.

19
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,625
Now, come to my side, Shun.

20
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:53,666
[SHUN gasps]

21
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,916
Don't listen to him.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,666
Uh... But he's...

23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,791
It's true that we
share no blood.

24
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,250
But it's also true that I
brought you into this world,

25
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,916
and raised you as my own.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,333
So, I'd say you're mine.
As would your mother.

27
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,500
You're lucky that
Shun cares for you.

28
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,333
Otherwise I'd kill
you right here.

29
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,208
And how precisely
would you do that,

30
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,750
when you can't even
summon your Warp Relic?

31
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:18,916
[EMILIO grunts]

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,083
[ASANAGA]
Step away from him, Shun.

33
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,333
[ASANAGA grunts]

34
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,458
[EMILIO]
We're leaving.

35
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,791
[BOTH panting]

36
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:37,500
[EMILIO groans]

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,625
[ASANAGA] So, Delzaine
followed me after all.

38
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,833
What happened?

39
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,583
[ASANAGA]
How strange.

40
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,833
Where the hell am I?

41
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:45,500
[DELZAINE]
You slept a long time.

42
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,291
How do you feel?

43
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,333
[DELZAINE]
Welcome, stranger.

44
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:53,041
For what purpose have you
travelled to our kingdom?

45
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,958
I have none. I was
in my research lab

46
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,458
and then I was pulled
into this light.

47
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,666
I suppose I owe you my thanks.

48
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,500
You can thank my brother.

49
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,500
If you're from the surface,
he would speak with you.

50
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,833
The surface? What do you
mean? What is this place?

51
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,375
[DELZAINE] A world below yours.
Called Endora.

52
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,458
[gasps]

53
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,791
[ALZERM]
To think,

54
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,916
there really was another
world on the surface.

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,041
Tell me, Asanaga. How different
is your land from this one?

56
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,000
Four hundred years ago,
I would say that they

57
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,125
were fairly similar. But
my people now have tools

58
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,125
which allow us to shape
our world as we like.

59
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,541
[ALZERM]
This level of technology

60
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,500
is common on the surface?

61
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,875
[ASANAGA] Yes. Endora is
truly a marvelous place:

62
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,666
beautiful beyond measure.

63
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,250
But we've made advances
on the surface.

64
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,125
My people enjoy luxuries
that yours have never known.

65
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,291
Oh? I would like to hear
more of these luxuries.

66
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,708
To name a few, large winged
vehicles that expedite travel.

67
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:59,333
Handheld tools that allow speech
to cross great distance.

68
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,125
And weapons more powerful
than you could imagine.

69
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:06,250
I can imagine much.
You've piqued my interest.

70
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,000
[ASANAGA]
I'm in your debt, my prince.

71
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,125
I'll repay the favor someday.

72
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,000
[DELZAINE]
You intend to return, then?

73
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,583
Yes.

74
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,875
At least for as long as the king
continues to find me tolerable.

75
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,833
After all, what scientist
wouldn't leap

76
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:25,250
at the chance to explore
an entirely new world?

77
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,500
[ASANAGA]
Amazing.

78
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,791
I've just made the discovery
of the century.

79
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,833
[ASANAGA]
Remember that crystal you found?

80
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,125
Well I've been analyzing it,
and you would never guess

81
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,500
what I've discovered.
It's truly incredible.

82
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:41,916
Revolutionary!

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,791
[laughs]

84
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,125
What's funny?

85
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,750
Nothing really, it's just
refreshing to see you

86
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,791
get so excited about something.

87
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,541
I feel like it isn't a side of
you I get to see very often.

88
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,291
Yes, well I don't think anyone
could avoid getting excited

89
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,291
about something this big.

90
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,166
So? What is it?

91
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,000
[ASANAGA]
I can't tell you just yet.

92
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,583
But believe me when I say that
once this research is finished,

93
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,791
everyone will come
to admire my work,

94
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:09,250
and my lab will grow into one of
the world's largest companies.

95
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,333
[MAKIKO] That's quite the
vision. I hope it comes true.

96
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,375
Just remember that no
matter what happens,

97
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,833
I already know what an
amazing scientist you are.

98
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,958
It's all right, dear. I know
how crazy this sounds.

99
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,583
Thanks for being so
patient with me.

100
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:27,416
If I play this right, I can make
a better life for all of us.

101
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,708
For you, and for our baby boy.

102
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:34,875
[MAKIKO] Thank you. But, don't
push yourself too hard, okay?

103
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,125
This little one
needs both of us.

104
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:40,291
Yeah, and we'll be there.

105
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,708
Makiko!

106
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,791
Is she okay?

107
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,833
Your wife will recover within
the week, but we lost the child.

108
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,625
[ASANAGA]
Uh... What happened?

109
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:56,750
[MAKIKO whimpers]
You weren't there. I'm so sorry.

110
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:57,916
[ASANAGA grunts]

111
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,875
[ALZERM] So the surface
has no Warp Particles,

112
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,958
nor anything like Warp Relics?

113
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,208
[ASANAGA]
To be perfectly honest,

114
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,083
I was almost skeptical
when you first told me

115
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,500
of their existence.

116
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,083
The existence of such a particle
defies almost everything

117
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,125
I've been taught as a scientist.

118
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,916
So Endora possesses something
the surface does not.

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,125
I'm glad to hear you haven't
surpassed us in every aspect.

120
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,166
[ASANAGA] That's one point, but
Endora has other advantages too,

121
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,875
our simple sun cannot hope to
compare with the spectacle

122
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:30,166
of Adamas. Nor is our land
quite so rich with life.

123
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes, you'd be hard pressed
to beat us in that.

124
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,041
Huh?

125
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,166
Allow me, sir.

126
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,041
What is that thing?

127
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,583
[ASANAGA]
A ferrocerium lighter:

128
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,583
it's essentially just a
more efficient version

129
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,125
of the flint and steel that
you're accustomed to.

130
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,375
[ALZERM]
I see.

131
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,875
[DELZAINE]
Mm...

132
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,416
[ASANAGA] If it's of interest,
you're welcome to keep it.

133
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,166
[ALZERM]
Are you sure?

134
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:59,041
Ahh! The more you teach
me about the surface,

135
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,541
the greater it seems.

136
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:01,333
[door opens]

137
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,291
[EMILIO]
Daddy!

138
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,333
[MAID 1B] Lord Emilio!
You mustn't interrupt!

139
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,375
[ALZERM]
It's fine. Leave him be.

140
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,083
[EMILIO coos]

141
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:15,375
[ALZERM] He's strong willed,
like his father! [chuckles]

142
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,958
Uh. Who's that?

143
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:20,791
What, you don't remember him?
This is our old friend Asanaga.

144
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,000
[ASANAGA]
It's been too long, Lord Emilio.

145
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,250
[EMILIO]
Asa... naga?

146
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,208
[ALZERM] You were quite young
the first time you met him,

147
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,583
I'm don't think you
could even walk yet.

148
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,041
I recall you expecting
a child of your own.

149
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,375
How does fatherhood suit you?

150
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,583
I... Yes.

151
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,500
It suits me just fine.

152
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,625
Well, the next time
you come to Endora,

153
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,333
you should bring
the brat with you.

154
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,750
I bet you'd like to have a
playmate from the surface,

155
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:44,500
wouldn't you?

156
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,000
Surface?

157
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,250
That's right.

158
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,833
Uh. Uh!

159
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,416
[ALZERM laughs] This is the kind
of thing they play with there!

160
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,666
What do you think?

161
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,916
[EMILIO]
I wanna go there.

162
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,458
Here's a thought, Delzaine.

163
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,583
Why don't you have Asanaga
examine your son,

164
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,958
and see what can
be done for him?

165
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,625
Medicine isn't my
field of expertise.

166
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,041
Can you tell me what
it is that ails him?

167
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,500
I cannot.

168
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,625
All I know is there was some
kind of outbreak last year

169
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,666
and he was one of the victims.

170
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,041
Delzaine's boy was born with
a fragile constitution.

171
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,916
A great deal weaker than Emilio.

172
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,208
[ASANAGA] I understand, sir.
I can't make any guarantees,

173
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:24,166
but there is a chance that
surface medicine could save him.

174
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,125
Our only other option
is to keep watching

175
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,708
as his condition worsens.

176
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,000
You've heard how
advanced the surface is.

177
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:33,083
You should let Asanaga
seek care for him there.

178
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,250
I want nothing more than to
help my son get well again.

179
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,416
However...

180
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,791
[ASANAGA]
I can certainly sympathize

181
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,541
with your reluctance
to part with your son.

182
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,708
But, if his highness
would allow us to restore

183
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,208
the ancient ruins of Babel,
you could accompany us

184
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,791
to the surface, and oversee
your child's care.

185
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,416
Do you actually believe
such a thing could be done?

186
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,333
The mechanics are a bit
different from what I'm used to.

187
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,583
But I should be able
to manage, and if I do,

188
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,291
it would allow you to import
the surface's technologies

189
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,791
and take what you'd like.

190
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,916
Indeed. My dream of uniting
our worlds under one banner

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,041
might not be so
farfetched after all.

192
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,625
[DELZAINE]
We mustn't consider this!

193
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,375
Babel can never
be opened again!

194
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,750
Our ancestors
explicitly forbade it!

195
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,333
[ASANAGA] I apologize.
If your ancestors are here

196
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,833
at this table, please tell
them I meant no offense.

197
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,708
I was merely hoping to help
your king usher his people into

198
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,000
a new age of wealth and
progress while saving

199
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:26,458
the life of your son, but not if
it offends their sensibilities.

200
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,958
Careful. He has a sharp
tongue, this one!

201
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:33,083
[laughs]

202
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:38,000
[snoring]

203
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,958
[growls]

204
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,041
[inaudible]

205
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,750
If Asanaga can change my
brother, what will he do to you?

206
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,041
[gasps]

207
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,625
[DELZAINE]
Take care of him.

208
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,916
[ASANAGA]
Of course. As if he were my own.

209
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,916
I can't fully describe
the wonders

210
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,291
that physicians on the
surface are capable of.

211
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,833
[DELZAINE]
Thank you.

212
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,291
You've made the right choice.

213
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:09,958
[ALZERM]
Well done, Asanaga!

214
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,291
I never imagined that
Babel could be restored

215
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,083
in so little time.

216
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,083
[ASANAGA]
I'm honored, Your Grace.

217
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,125
I'd like to reward
your great service.

218
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,583
Name anything you desire,
and I will make it yours.

219
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,583
It's reward enough to know
that I've been of help

220
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,541
in some small way, Your Grace.

221
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,000
[ALZERM] Why hold back?
We're friends, you and I.

222
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:30,000
There must be something
you would ask.

223
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:33,708
[ASANAGA] It's less of a
request, than... a suggestion.

224
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,333
[DELZAINE]
I understand that you intend

225
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,750
to take my brother
to the surface.

226
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,958
Listen well. You will bring
me my son and close Babel.

227
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,500
[ASANAGA]
Spare me the brash talk.

228
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,250
I have done absolutely
nothing here

229
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,500
that your brother
didn't ask me to do.

230
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,875
[DELZAINE] I'm sure that
compared to the civilization

231
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,416
you have on the surface, we must
seem barbaric. But Endora has

232
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,583
prospered for thousands
of years exactly as she is.

233
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,750
I can't put this
beautiful world at risk

234
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,916
just to satiate my
brother's greed.

235
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,333
[ASANAGA]
Sounds like your brother's

236
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,250
abusing his throne. Maybe you
should take it from him.

237
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,125
[DELZAINE]
Huh?

238
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,458
Yes. You could simply kill him.

239
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,250
The kingdom would be
better off and you know it.

240
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,708
[DELZAINE]
How dare you?!

241
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,750
[ASANAGA]
Heh.

242
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,458
[DELZAINE growls]

243
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,000
That blade must leave
a very recognizable cut

244
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,083
unless you're willing to be
banished for the crime,

245
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,541
I'd murder me with
something else.

246
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,958
But remember, I have your son.

247
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,458
[DELZAINE growls]

248
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,958
Don't worry, I'll be
gone soon enough.

249
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:41,000
There's just one last
thing I have to finish.

250
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:51,041
You bastard! After all this
time, you'd betray me?

251
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,958
[ASANAGA] Wrong. Betrayal
implies past loyalty.

252
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,541
[ALZERM]
Why are you doing this?

253
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,583
Let's see. You've ceased to be
of use, and I don't like you.

254
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,875
[ALZERM]
I'll make you pay.

255
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,416
[ALZERM yells]

256
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,791
[gunshot]

257
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,958
[DELZAINE]
Brother!

258
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,708
How could you? He thought
you were his friend.

259
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,666
[ASANAGA] He thought he could
use me to get weapons

260
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,541
from the surface. I want to make
sure that will never happen.

261
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,291
[gunshots]

262
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,541
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

263
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,500
No, wait! Give me back my son!

264
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,041
If you love him more than I do,

265
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,166
then follow me to the
surface and prove it.

266
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,166
[EMILIO]
I'm sorry, Shun.

267
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,458
[gasps]

268
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,291
You've got nothin'
to be sorry for.

269
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,250
But I've given you
a bitter memory.

270
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,583
[SHUN]
No. That's not your fault.

271
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,458
It's funny. He told me to my
face that I'm not his son.

272
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,500
But I still don't believe it.

273
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:36,708
I'd rather fake like
we're okay. Weird, right?

274
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,916
Welcome home, what
kept you so... long?

275
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,666
I'm sorry.

276
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,125
Whatever this is, we can talk
about it inside. Come on.

277
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,791
Yes. What he told you was true.

278
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:17,166
So you knew as well?
The truth about Endora?

279
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,291
He was always careful to
keep the details from me.

280
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,291
Honestly, I didn't want to ask.

281
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,416
[SHUN]
Well...

282
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,958
[MAKIKO, EMILIO gasp]

283
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,333
I... There was a part of me
hoping that Dad had maybe lied

284
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,791
to both of us, somehow.

285
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,708
At least that way I'd know
something had been real!

286
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,666
It was real, Shun.

287
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,791
From the day you came home,
you were mine. My son.

288
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,375
And there's nothing that
could ever make that a lie.

289
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,625
[gasps]

290
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:05,041
[MAKIKO]
Where've you been? I...

291
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,250
He's sleeping.

292
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,333
Why on earth do you
have a baby with you?

293
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,958
He's very ill. I'm taking
him to the hospital.

294
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:14,250
[SHUN cries]

295
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,625
Aw. Well then, we should
head there right now,

296
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,458
he's burning up.

297
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,750
[SHUN laughs]

298
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,708
[BOTH laughing]

299
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,458
[ASANAGA]
Up you go! You like that?

300
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:36,833
[MAKIKO] He's healthy now.
We should give him back.

301
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:40,458
Do you really think that
would be the best for him?

302
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,333
[ASANAGA]
He loves you. I can see it.

303
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,458
[ASANAGA]
He was on the brink of death.

304
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:52,083
But we took him in, and he
lived. Haven't we earned this?

305
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,458
[SHUN coos]

306
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,666
[MAKIKO]
Yes. I knew it was wrong, but...

307
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,333
When the time came to let
you go, I couldn't do it.

308
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,916
[SHUN]
Mom, I...

309
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,291
[MAKIKO] I know, if I'd really
cared about your happiness,

310
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:14,500
I would've made him take
you back to your world.

311
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,875
I'm sorry.

312
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,750
[SHUN]
No, you can't say that.

313
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,041
[MAKIKO]
It's true.

314
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,125
[SHUN] I was happy here
and you know it.

315
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,708
Don't pretend that isn't true!

316
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,375
I don't care how you got me;
you're the only mother I have

317
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,708
and no one could replace you!

318
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:28,791
[MAKIKO gasps]

319
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,458
I don't know the mother
I was born to,

320
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,041
and I'm sure she loved me,

321
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,791
but I can't think of one way she
could've done better than you.

322
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:38,333
And honestly... I feel
the same way about Dad.

323
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,250
I mean sure, he works too much.

324
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,083
But I've always
known he loved us.

325
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,833
I was never unhappy here.

326
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,250
Shun. My sweet boy.

327
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:50,750
I'm so happy that I
got to be your mother.

328
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:54,875
Why, though? Why did he do it?

329
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,125
[MAKIKO]
Hold out your hand for me.

330
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,416
[SHUN]
Oh, yeah.

331
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,250
This was always in my room.

332
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,833
[MAKIKO] On the day he brought
you home it was on your wrist.

333
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:14,083
It's the only connection to
your parents you came with.

334
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:14,708
[EMILIO]
Shun.

335
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,916
[SHUN]
Uh.

336
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,083
That bracelet you're holding
bears the emblem

337
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,208
of the Royal Family.

338
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,083
You mean your family?

339
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,958
You're a Langheim.
We are cousins.

340
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:27,666
Wait. That would mean that
my real father was...

341
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,000
[EMILIO]
Yeah.

342
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,791
[SHUN] Do you consider him
your son, or don't you?

343
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:34,166
[DELZAINE] Yes, that's right.
Emilio is my son.

344
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,666
No, he's your dad.

345
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,625
I might be the son he
raised, but he dedicated

346
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,791
his entire life to rebuilding
Babel and finding you.

347
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,041
[SHUN gasping]

348
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,208
Can't sleep either?

349
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,416
[SHUN]
My head won't stop spinning.

350
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,708
I thought I was a normal guy.

351
00:18:56,791 --> 00:19:02,041
Not the son of a dead king
from another world.

352
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,416
[EMILIO] You know, I
actually remember you.

353
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,458
[SHUN]
Uh.

354
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,416
[EMILIO]
How long'll he be sick for?

355
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,083
His father's looking for
the best doctors in Endora,

356
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,333
trying to figure out what
kind of medicine he needs.

357
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:17,041
You'll be able to play
together once he finds it.

358
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:24,458
Uh? Don't worry! We're gonna
play together soon, 'kay?

359
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,416
[EMILIO] You were the only
person I knew who wasn't

360
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,125
an adult. I felt like I'd made
my first friend that day.

361
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:35,500
Delzaine tried everything to
save you. He was desperate.

362
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:40,083
And when all else failed,
he... sent you here.

363
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,625
I admire him.

364
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,000
Yeah?

365
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,833
[EMILIO] Everyone blamed him
for killing his brother.

366
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,208
I despised him to
the core of my being.

367
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,916
Even tried to kill him.

368
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,541
But he did everything he could
to find his lost son again.

369
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,708
And in the end, he did.

370
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,333
I... I don't...

371
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,333
I do understand how you feel.

372
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,416
It's exactly how I
felt with Delzaine.

373
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,958
He's the man who raised me.

374
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:10,000
Yeah, but that wasn't my
father we talked to today.

375
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,500
He confessed, flat out.
He killed my father.

376
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,333
Yes, I killed your
brute of a father.

377
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:21,083
No way--not Dad.
He's not a killer.

378
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,958
[SHUN cries]

379
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,833
[SHUN]
Why, dad? Why'd you do it?

380
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:46,625
