1
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:14,208
[SHUN laughing]

2
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:19,208
[PASCAL]
Coming in for a landing!

3
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,208
I'd recommend holding
onto something.

4
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,125
Why do we need to do that?

5
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,333
[ALL screaming]

6
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,333
[screaming continues]

7
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,666
[PASCAL] Not a bad landing,
if I do say so myself.

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,083
For real?

9
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,208
"An adventurer is no stranger
to thrill and danger!"

10
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,875
Is that some sort of saying?

11
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:46,958
I wrote it!

12
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,208
[chuckles]

13
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,625
Pretty catchy, huh?

14
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,291
[ALICIA]
Hurry, Shun!

15
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,125
You want us to leave you behind?

16
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,916
[PASCAL]
Here we are!

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,208
This is your hiding spot?

18
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,625
[FALARION squeaks]

19
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,375
[PASCAL] That's right.
Impressive, isn't it?

20
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,791
No one will ever find us here.

21
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,750
[ALICIA]
But it's just a gigantic hole!

22
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,000
[SHUN yelling]

23
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,333
Awesome rocks.

24
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,458
[ALICIA]
What are you doing back there?

25
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,333
We're going on without you!

26
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,458
[EMILIO]
Hmph.

27
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:23,958
I'm coming!

28
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,208
[SHUN growling]

29
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,375
Come on, guys!

30
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,708
[SHUN]
Damn you!

31
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:34,625
[SHUN]
What's this?

32
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,833
[ALICIA]
Wow! Nice setup, Pascal!

33
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,125
I take back what I said.

34
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,208
I guess it's more than
just a gigantic hole.

35
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,333
[PASCAL chuckles]

36
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,666
What's the blue thing?
A sleeping bag?

37
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,083
Why would you sleep in a bag?

38
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,541
Well, it's more like a
blanket you travel with.

39
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,750
[ALICIA]
Then, yeah. That's what it is.

40
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,708
Easy there. Don't pull so hard.

41
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,458
You'll rip it if
you're not careful.

42
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,041
[PASCAL]
King Delzaine gave me that.

43
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,458
It's quite a piece of work.

44
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,041
I assume you have
yours with you, too, eh?

45
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,375
[PASCAL]
Here.

46
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,583
So now that we have a moment,

47
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,291
maybe you can tell me
the whole story.

48
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,083
How did the prince come
to be locked in the dungeon

49
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,541
like a criminal?

50
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,583
[PASCAL]
And what about the other boy?

51
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,666
Shun's his name, isn't it?

52
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,708
Tell me more about
how you met him.

53
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,458
Honestly, there's
not much to tell.

54
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,500
I was in the dungeon
and he just appeared.

55
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,750
[PASCAL]
Huh?

56
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,083
[EMILIO]
It was strange.

57
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,000
A ball of light
formed out of nowhere.

58
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,416
[PASCAL]
Indeed?

59
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,041
I looked inside it, and
what I saw there was amazing.

60
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,458
It was a land like
none I've ever known.

61
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,958
[SHUN yelling]

62
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:05,208
Then, while I was watching,
he came flying out of it.

63
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,833
What I saw...

64
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,083
The strange place
inside the light...

65
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,791
Do you think that
was the surface?

66
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,666
[PASCAL]
That seems likely to me.

67
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,291
[SHUN]
Oh, wow, look at this!

68
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,916
[ALICIA]
Hey! What are you up to?

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,125
Uh, just taking a look around.

70
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,958
Does everyone from
the surface love rocks?

71
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,208
[SHUN]
No, not everyone.

72
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,208
My mom was an
archaeologist, though.

73
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,916
An archaeologist? What's that?

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,125
[SHUN] They study human history
by looking at material remains.

75
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,625
[ALICIA]
Oh, cool.

76
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,500
[SHUN] My mom would freak out
if she was here right now.

77
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,208
She'd love this!

78
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,208
You know, I've heard of
the Hollow Earth Theory,

79
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,166
and I always thought
it was freakin' crazy.

80
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,083
Now it turns out
it was true all along!

81
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,041
Except I thought this place
was supposed to be called

82
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,750
Shambhala or something.

83
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,041
Well, it's not.

84
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,291
I've never heard it called
anything but Endora.

85
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,666
Hey, is it really true that the
people where you're from

86
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,208
don't know about us?

87
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,458
Yeah, no one has a clue
there's a world down here.

88
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,583
From the time
we're little kids,

89
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:01,916
we're taught that
the Earth is solid.

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,875
What would happen if
word got out about Endora?

91
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,333
Would they get all excited
and call it a great discovery?

92
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,250
Would there be
a big celebration?

93
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,583
Uh, somehow I doubt it.

94
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,125
So we don't know about you,
but you know about us.

95
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,625
Have you thought of going to the
surface to see it for yourself?

96
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,250
Huh? No, not really.

97
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,583
[PASCAL]
Endora and the surface.

98
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,416
Two worlds that
must remain separate.

99
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,041
Even if they have
knowledge of each other,

100
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,291
they cannot be
allowed to intertwine.

101
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,708
Ancient texts warn us
that contact between the two

102
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:32,291
will bring no benefit
and may do great harm.

103
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,250
In the mythology of the surface,
the underworld is hell.

104
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,708
It is the world of the dead.

105
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,250
That idea was spread to
keep surface dwellers away,

106
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,708
and so there must have
been a good reason for it.

107
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,250
But not all of those
from above feared our land.

108
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,916
Some from the surface
ventured into Endora.

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,166
They returned to tell of
an underground paradise

110
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,500
called Shambhala.

111
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,958
Babylon was the city that
connected Endora to the surface.

112
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,166
Within it was Babel, the
portal between the two worlds.

113
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,250
Several decades ago,
Babel was restored.

114
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,750
But not for long.

115
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,958
Shortly after its restoration,
Babel ceased functioning.

116
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,458
King Delzaine hopes to
bring it to life once more,

117
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,166
and so he called me
and other scholars

118
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,291
to the Royal Laboratory
to help him determine

119
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,750
how it might be accomplished.

120
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,166
I came, but...

121
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,750
You were against his plan.

122
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,416
Yeah.

123
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,958
So you left.

124
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,958
Because you didn't want to help
the king get Babel working.

125
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,500
[PASCAL]
Pretty much, yes.

126
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,500
This is something
I truly believe.

127
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,750
Endora and the surface
must not have contact.

128
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,166
[EMILIO]
How can you be so sure?

129
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,166
I just am.
I know it in my bones.

130
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,625
[EMILIO]
Intuition?

131
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,833
That doesn't seem
terribly scientific to me.

132
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,916
Being a great scientist
requires more than

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,500
intelligence and dedication.

134
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,583
Intuition plays
an important role.

135
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,458
There is only so much that
can be proven using logic.

136
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,333
But science is all about logic.

137
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,791
[PASCAL laughs]

138
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,833
It's all right. I wouldn't
expect a young pup like you

139
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,291
to understand this stuff.

140
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,916
Shut up, old man.

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,250
The king is a fiend.

142
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,833
You can oppose him if you want,

143
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,583
but in the end he isn't going
to listen to anyone but himself.

144
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,083
A fiend, eh? Don't you think
that's going a bit far?

145
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,625
He is your father, after all.

146
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,000
[EMILIO]
He's not my father.

147
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,208
He's the man who raised you,

148
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,541
so I'd say that makes
him close enough.

149
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,750
[PASCAL] Let me guess...
You argued and he grounded you.

150
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:12,875
[laughs]

151
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,208
Is that why you
were in the dungeon?

152
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,708
You planned your
escape thoroughly.

153
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,916
Why were you so sure
they'd be coming for you?

154
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,250
I tampered a bit with the
master diagram to make sure

155
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,875
they would have a
difficult time completing

156
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,625
the restoration of Babel.

157
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,000
I knew they'd figure out
what I had done eventually.

158
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,041
The new researcher must be
pretty good to have done it

159
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,500
this fast, though.
[laughs]

160
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,458
That bastard succeeded?

161
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,458
Take it easy.

162
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,875
If they know what you did,

163
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,875
does that mean they're
on their way to restore Babel?

164
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,208
I suspect they are.

165
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,208
If I can, I would like
to arrive before they do.

166
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,750
That's the only way I can
do what needs to be done.

167
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:43,958
Once we get to Babylon,

168
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,041
we'll return Shun
to the surface,

169
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:51,708
and then I plan to destroy
Babel once and for all.

170
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,041
Also, whenever you feel
like talking, I'll be ready.

171
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,208
Talking?

172
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,750
About the real reason you
were locked up in the dungeon.

173
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:01,958
[PASCAL]
Now come on.

174
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,333
We should go inside.

175
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,583
You can keep the blade.

176
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,041
[EMILIO]
Hey, Pascal!

177
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,625
Do you envy the researcher
who replaced you in the lab?

178
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:10,666
Do you hate him?

179
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,333
[PASCAL]
No, why would I?

180
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,458
I can pursue my
research anywhere.

181
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,458
In fact, I actually
enjoy it more now

182
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,208
that I have some freedom.

183
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,833
[EMILIO]
I can't let him get involved.

184
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,458
It's too dangerous.

185
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,750
[EMILIO grunting]

186
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,458
Perhaps we should play
a different game, Highness.

187
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,583
Did I ask for your opinion?

188
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,416
[MAID 1A]
No, Highness.

189
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,875
[EMILIO yells]

190
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,500
[MAID 1B] It's like
he's a different person.

191
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,791
I don't recognize him!

192
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:53,833
[MAID 1A]
He's out of control.

193
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,833
We must find a way to stop this!

194
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,791
[PASCAL]
Those poor puppets.

195
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,375
What did they do to deserve
such harsh punishment?

196
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,541
[EMILIO]
Huh?

197
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,916
You dare speak to me?

198
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,166
A good day to you,
too, Your Highness.

199
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,791
Might I say how happy
I am to meet you?

200
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,083
[EMILIO yells]

201
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,583
[PASCAL laughing]

202
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:17,875
[EMILIO]
You jerk!

203
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,291
Forgive my little joke.

204
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,458
There isn't much time for humor
in the Royal Laboratory,

205
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,333
so I must take it
where I can get it.

206
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,375
If you'll allow me to introduce
myself, my name's Pascal,

207
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,333
and from today on I will be
in charge of your education.

208
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:33,333
I admit that I'm not
very skilled with a sword.

209
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,666
Nevertheless, I think you'll
find that I have a number

210
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,208
of tricks up my sleeve.

211
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,291
Should you wish it,

212
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,333
I would be happy
to teach them to you.

213
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,041
I think the two of us could
get along well, Your Highness.

214
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,916
[PASCAL chuckles]

215
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,125
[EMILIO laughs]

216
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:24,750
[EMILIO laughs]

217
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,500
[PASCAL]
Please listen to me!

218
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,375
[PASCAL]
Majesty!

219
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,500
Sire, please, if you would
listen to me for a moment,

220
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,000
that's all I ask.

221
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,291
I beg you!

222
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,125
Restoring Babel may be more
dangerous than you realize.

223
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,166
It'll mean disaster for Endora!

224
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,375
Please, don't do it!

225
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,250
What makes you so
certain it's dangerous?

226
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,958
My intuition as a scientist.

227
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,333
And what use does a man of
science have for intuition?

228
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,708
Please, sire!

229
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,541
When I give orders,
I expect them to be followed.

230
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,375
I make no exceptions.

231
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,958
If you will not obey me,
I have no use for your service.

232
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,791
[PASCAL]
Wait, you don't understand!

233
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,583
[GUARD 3A]
Let's go. You've been dismissed.

234
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:03,791
[PASCAL]
Majesty!

235
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,416
[EMILIO growls]
That bastard.

236
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,458
He takes everything
I care about away from me.

237
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,708
[GUARD CAPTAIN 2A]
It was uncanny.

238
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,208
Almost as if he knew we were
coming and had prepared for it.

239
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,125
[DELZAINE]
So, he outsmarted you then.

240
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,625
That doesn't surprise me.

241
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,875
[GUARD CAPTAIN 2A]
Apologies, my lord.

242
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,666
I've ordered the
second and third platoons

243
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,291
to continue searching without
rest until he is found.

244
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,583
[DELZAINE]
No need for that.

245
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,083
[GUARD CAPTAIN 2A]
But your orders...

246
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,791
[GUIDORO] Will be carried out
by someone more competent.

247
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,833
Now run along and
find a wall to defend.

248
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,000
We can take care of it.

249
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,166
[GUARD CAPTAIN 2A]
What?

250
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,750
King's orders.
Get out of here, soldier.

251
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,000
Ugh...

252
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,541
I still don't get why you
used the grunts for this job.

253
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,958
Seems like a waste of time.

254
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,416
Better to have us go
after Pascal straight off.

255
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,708
[DELZAINE] I wouldn't
be so sure about that.

256
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,916
You are only to
assess the situation.

257
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,291
Your orders are not to kill.
Understood?

258
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,750
Yes, sir.

259
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,291
We will make sure to
remember our duty. Right?

260
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,166
Yep.

261
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,166
Agreed.

262
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,583
[VESTULSE grunts]

263
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,875
[PASCAL] I don't know how
long we're gonna be stuck

264
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,791
on this mountain.
It could be a while.

265
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:21,875
It's best to be prepared,

266
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,708
so I'm going to
get us some supplies.

267
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,333
I'll head down to the
nearby village on foot.

268
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,291
[PASCAL] It only makes sense
to wear a disguise.

269
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,583
I'm a wanted man.

270
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,291
Right. Good idea.
You look great.

271
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,166
Yeah? I'm not so sure.

272
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,458
I think he looks more
conspicuous like this.

273
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,166
[ALICIA]
Well, uh, maybe.

274
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,125
I have taken some precautions
to ensure our safety here.

275
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,666
The herbs I scattered
along our trail

276
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,625
should distract their
wolves from our scent.

277
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,333
But that doesn't mean you
shouldn't be careful,

278
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,500
understand?

279
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,833
Don't leave the cave
if you can help it.

280
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:51,958
[SHUN]
Right.

281
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,333
If I'm not back here
by tomorrow night,

282
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,375
then your best bet is to
look for me at the village.

283
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,458
It's called Megido.

284
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,416
[PASCAL] However, you'll want to
be extremely careful about it.

285
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,625
'Kay. Sounds good.

286
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,541
[PASCAL]
All right.

287
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,500
Wish me luck.

288
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,458
Good luck!
We'll see you later.

289
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,750
[ALICIA] Well, I might as well
go out and get us some water.

290
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:09,625
[SHUN]
Okay.

291
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:10,541
You want a hand with that?

292
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:11,708
[ALICIA]
Nah, I'll be fine.

293
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,333
[SHUN]
You sure?

294
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,708
What do you want?

295
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,000
I think we should talk.

296
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,083
How sweet!

297
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,750
Did Pascal tell you
to make nice?

298
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,666
It would be great if
you stopped bickering.

299
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,125
You know, for the record,
none of it's my fault.

300
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,625
He's the one who's
always snapping at me

301
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:25,875
for no apparent reason.

302
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,041
[ALICIA] Sure, whatever
you wanna tell yourself.

303
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,416
See you guys in a bit.

304
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,291
Try not to kill each other!

305
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,916
[SHUN] All right, what do
you want to talk about?

306
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,500
[EMILIO]
Sit down and I'll tell you.

307
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,666
I'm sick of being bossed around.
Why don't you sit down first?

308
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,166
Okay, what do you want?

309
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,666
Are you ready
to shut up and listen?

310
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,166
You ready to stop being an ass?

311
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,125
We need to get out of here.

312
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,500
Why do we have to leave?

313
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,333
[EMILIO] You want to go back
to your home, don't you?

314
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,750
Uh, yeah.

315
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,750
[EMILIO] Well, then...
I'm going to need your help.

316
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,291
My help with what?

317
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,000
Bringing down King
Delzaine once and for all.

318
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,958
Huh? Bringing down a king?

319
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,416
Find somebody else to help you.
I'm sure not gonna do it.

320
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,666
No way!

321
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,291
[EMILIO] I thought that
you wanted to go home.

322
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,250
Of course I do, but I'll
bet that I can find a way

323
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,291
to get there without
overthrowing a monarch.

324
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,125
Delzaine is likely on
his way to Babylon right now.

325
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,458
If he gets there before us,

326
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,708
you might never be able
to go back to the surface.

327
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,375
But if we defeat him, you'll
get to see your mother again.

328
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,166
[SHUN]
Come on, this is crazy.

329
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,416
You realize that, don't you?

330
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,916
It's not. I have a plan.

331
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,125
Is it a good one?

332
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,791
Yeah. But to make it work,
I'll need help.

333
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,083
Fine, I'm in.

334
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,791
So, where do we start?

335
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,000
We make our move tonight.

336
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,250
We'll leave when
Alicia's asleep.

337
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,333
[SHUN] Hold on.
We aren't bringing her with us?

338
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,208
No, and she can't
know about this.

339
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,916
She'll only interfere.

340
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,208
[ALICIA]
Anybody thirsty?

341
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,041
Hey! How's it goin'?

342
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,083
[ALICIA]
You're acting weird.

343
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:51,875
What's happening?

344
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,916
Huh? Nothing! Really!

345
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,666
You sound stupid!
You're giving it away!

346
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,416
Hey! I'm doing the best I can!

347
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,416
Do better!

348
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,541
She'll know we're
up to something.

349
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,916
I can handle this.

350
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,208
Really, what's up with you guys?

351
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,125
I don't know what
you're talking about.

352
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,583
[ALICIA]
Whatever.

353
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,000
Anyway, Emilio, shouldn't we
be making ourselves useful

354
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,875
by gathering
mushrooms or something?

355
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,083
Yes! A splendid idea!

356
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,791
And you think I'm
going to give us away?

357
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:14,833
Listen to yourself!

358
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,666
Shut up!

359
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,958
What has gotten into you two?

360
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,666
[EMILIO] You know...
we could use some meat.

361
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,541
I think I'll go hunting.

362
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,291
You're coming with me.

363
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,625
Hey, let me go! Geez!

364
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,958
Would it kill you
to ask first?

365
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,166
You're a terrible actor.

366
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,791
It's your fault
if she figures us out!

367
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,416
Yeah, well, you're not
gonna win any awards yourself.

368
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,333
I summon thee!

369
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,125
"I summon thee"?

370
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,041
It pumps me up;
gets me ready to fight.

371
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,958
What's so wrong about that?

372
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,708
[EMILIO] He may look stupid,
but he's getting better

373
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,208
with his Warp Relic.

[boar snorting]

375
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Here's the plan.

376
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,500
You're going to
chase it over this way.

377
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,875
I'll stay hidden here.

378
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,916
When it's close, I'll
ambush it and finish it off.

379
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,875
[SHUN]
Yeah, sure.

380
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,000
There a problem?

381
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,166
I don't care if
you take the easy role.

382
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,291
[EMILIO] Idiot! Killing the
beast is both more difficult

383
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,750
and more dangerous.

384
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,375
I should've left you
back at the cave.

385
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,333
[SHUN]
Man, you sure whine a lot.

386
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,583
I'm going.

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,125
Drive him a little bit further.

390

How do ya like me now?

[SHUN]
You didn't think I could do it!

397
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,833
Sounds like they're back!

398
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,791
[EMILIO] You only got the
kill because I set you up.

00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,083
[SHUN]
Oh yeah?

00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,333
And what about that
part where you fell over?

--Was that just an act?
--How was the hunting?

[EMILIO]
You're making things up now?

00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,375
That's just sad.

404
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,291
Wow, you got a big one!

405
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,000
[EMILIO]
Uh... Yeah.

406
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:26,208
No, I got it while Prince Priss
was tripping over his feet.

00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,500
Not true!

408
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,333
I'm the one who got
the kill, and you know it.

409
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:29,958
Shut up!

00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:30,750
You shut up!

Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

412
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,083
I will not shut up!

All right. Dinner is served.

Please tell me we're
not having more boar stew.

416

What's the matter
with boar stew?

Don't get me wrong,
I'm sure you're a good cook.

418
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,916
It's just...

419
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,583
This boar is kind of an
acquired taste, that's all.

420
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:50,750
[ALICIA]
So acquire it.

Mmm. Pretty tasty.

It's either this or starve, huh?

You like it that much?

What we're looking for.

[SHUN]
Could you be more specific?

433
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,250

Reinforcements.

[LOUISE]
I'm surprised.

438
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,000
A member of the royal
family should know better

439
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,958
than to set foot
in our territory.

You and your pal are dead men.

441

Everyone knows this territory
belongs to the Ignauts.

00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,541
So there are only two
reasons you'd come here.

443

You're either astonishingly
brave or astonishingly stupid.

444

I'm curious to find out
which of the two it is.

[SHUN] Hey, you said
something about reinforcements?

446

Should we be
expecting some company?

Well? Where are
these reinforcements?
