2
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:14,041
[SHUN coughing]

3
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,625
We thought you could
use a little help waking up.

4
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,916
Why do all men
behave like children?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,666
Sometimes all you
can do is keep fighting

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,166
until you see eye to eye.

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,666
I don't know how else
to explain it.

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,666
That's just how it is for guys.

9
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,458
[DEMETRIO] We still don't have
nearly enough support.

10
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,333
We'll have to go further afield.

11
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,000
Almost all of the
lords near the castle

12
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,875
are in Delzaine's good graces.

13
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,041
[LOUISE] True. They don't
share our outrage.

14
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,125
If they've been
well treated by Delzaine,

15
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,666
what reason could they have
to oppose the current rule?

16
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,958
If we could bring
them to our side,

17
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,750
it would do a lot
to further our cause.

18
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,333
Of course it would.

19
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,583
But what's the point in hoping
for that when they dismiss us

20
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,500
without even
listening to our views?

21
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,750
[DEMETRIO] So, near the castle
we'll find few friends,

22
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:33,958
but the further north we go,

23
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:37,166
the fewer lords will
bend to Delzaine's will.

24
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,708
We should have better
luck gaining support

25
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,916
in those areas.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,416
[LOUISE]
That makes sense.

27
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,500
The king forces those who
fall out of his favor northward.

28
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,166
They should be eager
for his rule to end.

29
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,833
At least we have
that going for us.

30
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,458
Still, I'd feel a
lot more confident

31
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,583
if we had more information
about the Royal Guard.

32
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:53,458
[EMILIO]
Eighty thousand.

33
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,541
[DEMETRIO]
Huh?

34
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,000
That's how many soldiers
there are in the Royal Guard.

35
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,291
Nearly eighty thousand.

36
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,250
I see.

37
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,208
That's more than
we had expected.

38
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,458
If we were to revolt now,

39
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,291
we'd almost certainly
find ourselves fighting

40
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,208
a losing battle.

41
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,750
I don't want to lose
one more person

42
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,375
than we absolutely have to.

43
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,125
A war won by great sacrifice
isn't what I'm after.

44
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,583
[LOUISE]
I agree, of course.

45
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,083
I'm no more eager to
lose men than you are.

46
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,583
But it will take a
lifetime to amass an army

47
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,916
equal to the Royal Guard.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,375
[DEMETRIO]
Yes, that's true.

49
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:27,250
And it's exactly why we
are gonna need help.

50
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,083
The Zoozians. Right?

51
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,083
[DEMETRIO]
Yep.

52
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,625
You would ally
with those beasts?

53
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,125
Are you mad?

54
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,375
You don't really expect them
to listen to reason, do you?

55
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,500
And have you ever had
dealings with Zoozians before?

56
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,708
[EMILIO] Delzaine employs some
of them as his enforcers.

57
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:45,208
Oh! The lion guy! We were--

58
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,625
I was attacked by
one outside the castle.

59
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,375
And he was crazy strong.
Way stronger than Prince Priss.

60
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,708
Shut up.

61
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,208
To be honest, he didn't
seem especially interested

62
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,833
in talking things out.

63
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,041
[DEMETRIO] But did you actually
try talking to him?

64
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,750
Uh... Well, no.

65
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,875
You should at least
give it a shot next time.

66
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,958
Huh? Yeah.

67
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,708
[DEMETRIO] The Zoozians
have long been oppressed

68
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,375
by royalty and nobles.

69
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,958
They very well may be
willing to side with us.

70
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,250
We should hope for it.

71
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,958
If they choose to,
we'll gain a powerful ally.

72
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,458
Be ready, Louise.

73
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,833
When the time comes, we'll
need you to be our negotiator.

74
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,875
Sure. You can count on me.

75
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,125
We want them to stand
beside us as partners,

76
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,583
willing to fight
until the bitter end

77
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,500
to uphold what we stand for.

78
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,791
They deserve to be more
than just pawns in a battle.

79
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,083
[SHUN] I don't really
know anything about

80
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,666
the local politics.

81
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,625
All I want is to find a way to
get to Babylon so I can go home.

82
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,125
Tell me something, will ya?

83
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,708
[DEMETRIO]
Huh?

84
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,333
[SHUN] What you really want is
to bring down Delzaine, right?

85
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,666
I mean, that's the whole point
of this revolution of yours.

86
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,000
[DEMETRIO]
Yeah.

87
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,166
Then I think you should
know that he's most likely

88
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,291
heading towards Babylon now.

89
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,125
The king is going to Babylon?

90
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,375
[LOUISE]
Come on, boys.

91
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,958
Let's get those wounds
patched up, shall we?

92
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,791
[EMILIO] Is Demetrio seriously
considering an alliance

93
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,625
with the Zoozians?

94
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,833
There's no denying
they're strong, but still...

95
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,416
Does he really think
they can be relied upon?

96
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,541
If his plan does work, though,

97
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,958
at least I won't need
this clown's help anymore.

98
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,916
[SHUN] If I can convince these
people to take me to Babylon,

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,583
I can ditch this punk and
finally get myself home.

100
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:25,041
Argh! Just looking at his
stupid face pisses me off!

101
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,125
I don't even want to breathe
the same air as this jerk.

102
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,291
[SHUN grunts]

103
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,333
[LOUISE]
Hm?

104
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,541
What's with the grunting?

105
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,875
Are you in a lot of pain?

106
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,416
No! I'm fine, thanks.

107
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,916
[LOUISE] You two boys sure
went all out on each other.

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,083
Don't worry, though.

109
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,541
When I'm done,
you'll be as good as new.

110
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,208
[LOUISE]
Here we are. Go on inside.

111
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,958
[SHUN]
In that hut? With him?

112
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,708
[EMILIO] We have to
go in there together?

113
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:48,791
--[SHUN] Dammit.
--[EMILIO] Dammit.

114
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,458
[LOUISE]
Why are you two standing there?

115
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,000
Go inside already.

116
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,583
Stand around here for too long
and you're basically asking

117
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,208
to get bitten by
an Endora mosquito.

118
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,291
Uh... Some bug doesn't
really scare me that much.

119
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,541
Now hold on!

120
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,583
Endora mosquitos
aren't just "some bug."

121
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,708
If one bites you,
you'll be lucky to escape

122
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,625
with a drop of blood
left in your body.

123
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,708
Damn!

124
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,666
They related to
Dracula or something?

125
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,875
[LOUISE]
Dracula?

126
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,958
[SHUN]
Uh, just forget about it.

127
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,958
[LOUISE] I've got to go grab
some medical supplies.

128
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll meet you two inside.

129
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:26,125
So, about that
scary-looking Zoozian guy.

130
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,166
Is there a reason none of
the other people of Endora

131
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,333
look like him?

132
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,208
[EMILIO sighs]

133
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,041
Well?

134
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,166
[EMILIO]
Don't talk to me.

135
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,458
[SHUN]
Huh?

136
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,125
[EMILIO] We're done.
I don't need you anymore.

137
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,000
What was that?

138
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,333
[LOUISE]
Are you serious?

139
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,500
I leave for two seconds
and you're fighting again?

140
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,083
[SHUN, EMILIO]
Hmph!

141
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,583
[LOUISE sighs]

142
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,375
[LOUISE]
It has to be in here somewhere.

143
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,750
You're close to Demetrio.

144
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,625
Is he really going to try to
ally with the Zoozians?

145
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,041
They look like monsters.

146
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,291
Does he seriously think
they're going to listen to him?

147
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:57,541
[LOUISE] Not everyone is born
to an equal station in life.

148
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,125
Regardless of social standing,

149
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,458
every person deserves
the right to live freely.

150
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,541
That's what Demetrio
always says.

151
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,458
If the Zoozians are violent,
it's for good reason.

152
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,250
Those in our
world known as Endras

153
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,375
are people born of
a cross between humans

154
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,000
and a species called Anadua.

155
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,500
The Zoozians, on the other hand,

156
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,541
are a cross between
the Anadua and animals.

157
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,458
Long ago, the Endras and
the Zoozians lived together

158
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,041
in peace and harmony.

159
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:27,583
That changed when the Endras
began persecuting the Zoozians.

160
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,875
The Endra kings sought
to unite Endora by force.

161
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,333
Hungering only for
power and control,

162
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,791
they cared little for who
might be harmed along the way.

163
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,416
Now the Endras, too,
are being oppressed.

164
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,958
As the Zoozians
have been for so long.

Both of my peoples,

167
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,458
I'm guessing you had
no idea I'm half Zoozian.

168
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,333
No way!

169
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,541
Surprising, isn't it?

170
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,583
You would never know
just by looking at me.

171
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,291
Zoozians typically have rather
frightening appearances,

172
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,000
and most aren't
much for talking,

173
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,708
which is why people
tend to fear them.

I, um, I'm sorry.

A spoiled boy without
a care in the world.

Or so he described it.

192
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,666
And he could have
continued on like that

if he didn't give a damn
about anyone else.

But things didn't
turn out that way.

Largely because of a

I don't understand why,

but I'm seeing something
about needing to find

331
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,666
an Endora bluebird if you
want to be able to return

to the surface.

And what's more,
I think I sense one of them

in that direction.

[SHUN]
Endora bluebird, here I come!

341
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,916
The Endora bluebird
doesn't exist.

342
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,625
I would say it's more
than fair payback

343
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:25,958
after he tried to trick me.

344
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,416
So whenever you're in danger,

345
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,208
do you see the
future every time?

346

No, that isn't
always the case.

I don't know how it works.

or even if it'll happen.

of the rebel army in this area.

The prince and that unknown boy
also seem to be with them.

00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,583
We've found the Ignauts!

354
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,125
We should set up an ambush.

with the prince?

I'd like to punch
his bratty face in.

but we are not
to harm the prince.

Deal! You made my day!

That's the boy.

Good. Leave him to me.

He said it was this way.

Shouldn't I have
seen it by now? Man...

368
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,208
Maybe it's hiding in the trees?

Hey!

You're that Zoozian guy
from the castle!

you remember me.

with the prince?

Dammit! What am I doing?

what happens to him.

This is it. I'm screwed!

running to help me?

have been anyone else?

Shut up!

Hey, Prince.

I'm supposed to bring you
back in one piece.

Personally, though, I think
you'd look better as a corpse.

Can you really tell
me you're satisfied

00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,291
and that it's not pathetic
being Delzaine's pawn?

And I'm sure all you rebel scum

lead virtuous and

wrong about that.
