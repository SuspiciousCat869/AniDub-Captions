1
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:18,833
We've done our best to
stop all this violence

2
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:21,666
against the villages.
But with mixed results.

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,416
We're a stopgap at best. The
only way this strife will really

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,250
end is if the
kingdom steps up.

5
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,666
[RALPH] Yes, but what can a
kingdom hope to accomplish

6
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,083
when it doesn't have a king?

7
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,708
[ALICIA laughs]
The castle! We've reached it!

8
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:38,875
[FALARION chirps]

9
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:42,000
[SHUN laughs]
There it is. The capital!

10
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,791
Home at last.

11
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,208
[sighs] What's the point
of maintaining a castle

12
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,916
that doesn't have a master?

13
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,791
I'm sure that Prince Emilio
will return someday.

14
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,666
[MAID 1A] How can you say that?
We don't know how the king died.

15
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,916
[AARON panting]

16
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,041
He-He's come back!

17
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,166
[MAIDS]
Who has?

18
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,041
[AARON]
It's Emilio.

19
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:09,166
Our prince has finally
returned to the capital!

20
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,708
Ah! It's awesome!

21
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:33,000
Castles on the surface aren't
even close to this cool!

22
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,291
[EMILIO] You've seen it
once before, remember?

23
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,333
[SHUN] Yeah, but I was too
busy running for my life

24
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,083
to take it all in.

25
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,458
It's unusually
quiet for a castle.

26
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,791
And I can only sense
a few people inside.

27
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:44,458
[gasps]

28
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,708
Prince Emilio!

29
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,166
Thank goodness you're safe.

30
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,291
Ha!

31
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,833
We are so honored to welcome
you home, Your Highness.

32
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,041
Glad to be back.
How have you been?

33
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,083
It's the same as
always with us.

34
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,583
Alicia, you're back too!

35
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,500
Yeah, about that. Sorry for
leaving without saying 'bye.

36
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,750
[chirps]

37
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,250
[MAID 1B]
Not to worry, my dear.

38
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,916
We're just glad
that you're safe.

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,625
Well isn't this nice.
It's a little reunion.

40
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:08,750
[DEMETRIO]
Heh.

41
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:09,708
[AARON]
Prince Emilio!

42
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,750
Uh?!

43
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,083
Aaron!

44
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,708
I'm glad you're well.
We've been waiting.

45
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,083
My men and I are at
your service as always.

46
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,083
Thanks, and it's good
to see you, too.

47
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,583
If I may, who have
you brought here?

48
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:28,166
Uh? These are my comrades.
I trust them with my life.

49
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,000
[gasps]

50
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,750
[MAID 1A] Of the soldiers
that went with the king

51
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:36,208
on his pilgrimage, less than
half returned after his death.

52
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:40,041
So few, but they didn't even
suffer a dozen casualties!

53
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,916
That may be true but...

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,041
[DEMETRIO]
The rest deserted, right?

55
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:47,458
They watched their paycheck die.
And knowing the chaos to come,

56
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,625
many decided they'd be
better off as brigands.

57
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:50,541
[EMILIO grunts]

58
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,250
[SHUN]
Well, screw those guys.

59
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,291
The capital is in a bad way at
the moment so many have left.

60
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,333
That's true for
the castle as well.

61
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,708
The few of us who remained

62
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,458
did so out of hope that
you might return someday.

63
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,708
[AARON] Stop right there! What
do you think you're doing?

64
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:04,791
[EMILIO, DEMETRIO, SHUN gasp]

65
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,666
[AARON]
On whose behalf are you spying?

66
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,291
If you're curious
about this castle,

67
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,916
I can show you to the dungeons!

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,791
This one's rather blusterous.

69
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,291
You need not die.

70
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,166
Submit yourselves
to arrest peacefully,

71
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,875
or we'll have no choice but to
bring you both in through force.

72
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:18,458
[SOLDIERS grunt]

73
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,625
[MISCHA grunts]

74
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,583
That's enough!

75
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,500
[ALL gasp]

76
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,583
[SOLDIER 17A]
Prince Emilio!

77
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,541
[SHUN]
You two started another fight?

78
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,416
All right, tell me
the truth of it.

79
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,416
These soldiers decided to kill
us for walking down the hall.

80
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,250
[AARON]
These are dangerous times.

81
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,708
So when I find strangers
wandering about where they have

82
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:42,291
no business, I assume
they're up to no good.

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,875
As I said before,
these are allies.

84
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,666
They pose no threat
to our cause.

85
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,541
[AARON]
But, they--

86
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,791
Now sheathe your blades.

87
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:56,458
As you command. I apologize
for my insubordinate words.

88
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,750
[DEMETRIO]
Hey. You two do the same.

89
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,958
Please understand, my prince.
We only wish to keep you safe.

90
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:08,041
I realize that. You've
been truly vigilant.

91
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,458
I trust them just
as I trust you.

92
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,833
[AARON]
If I could make a request.

93
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,291
Your comrades aren't known here,

94
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,625
so please have them refrain
from wandering alone,

95
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,833
especially the Zoozians.

96
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,166
We shall take our leave.

97
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,333
[SHUN sighs] Guy kinda
reminds me of a rent-a-cop.

98
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,333
But well done! Look at you,
mediating disputes and what not.

99
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,833

really startin' to shine buddy.

"You'll sheath your swords
at once, or else!"

101
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,791
Shut up. You've never
treated me differently

102
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:38,916
for being a prince before.

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,166
Uh!

104
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,083
Don't start.

105
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,583
[JOSEPH]
Where'd everyone go?

106
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,041
[PASCAL] They probably
left when the king died.

107
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:55,875
Some scientists see what they
do as nothing more than a job.

108
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,500
But what could they have chosen
over the unparalleled potential

109
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,250
for discovery possessed
by this lab?!

110
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,000
Surely there is no higher
joy than true learning!

111
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,250
I'm not incorrect, am I?

112
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,041
Nope. Not for us.

113
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,000
Now, let's sort out that
data we brought from Babel.

114
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,083
[JOSEPH]
Sure!

115
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,500
[RODNEY]
It's about time you showed up.

116
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,000
[PASCAL, JOSEPH gasp]

117
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:18,000
[laughs] Rodney! I'm glad
to see you made it!

118
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,375
Yeah. Now listen.

119
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm not a scientist anymore,
just a simple man with a bakery.

120
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,791
I only showed up to collect
that baking pan you promised.

121
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,625
Well you won't have too much
use for it if the entire country

122
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,291
gets destroyed, now will you?

123
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,166
I suppose you have a point!

124
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,666
Who is he, sir?

125
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,541
Rodney was my senior when
I started research here.

126
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,625
You might not know his name,
but you've seen his work.

127
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,291
I've based much of mine upon it.

128
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,000
[JOSEPH]
His work influenced your own?!

129
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,291
Amazing! Well then it must
have double-inspired mine!

130
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,958
Wow! Again I find
myself face-to-face

131
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,000
with one of the pioneers
of my field!

132
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,041
I'm unworthy of
this blissful day!

133
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,458
Well. You're exactly
like I heard you'd be.

134
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,791
Nice to meet you.

135
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,916
He's excitable, but talented.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,166
Together, we'll break
into research mysterious

137
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,041
as the world's ceiling
and develop instruments

138
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,833
to detect that which
once was fiction!

139
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,833
We will one of these days.
But for now, I'd like to focus

140
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,458
on the subjects of Warp
Particles and Babel.

141
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,583
Oh. Right, sorry.

142
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,708
You've found yourself
quite the protégé.

143
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,833
[laughs]

144
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,791
[DEMETRIO]
Planning to sit?

145
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:26,583
Uh! Demetrio.
Why'd you follow me?

146
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,583
Because I saw a young man
wander past me looking lost

147
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,625
and thought I'd ask him if
he knew where he was going.

148
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,250
I'm far from lost.
I grew up here.

149
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,625
Right. So what's up?

150
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,666
[EMILIO]
I was thinking.

151
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,708
About how small this
throne really is.

152
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:48,125
When Delzaine sat in it,
it seemed massive. Regal.

153
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,916
That's the thing
about a throne.

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,083
It's meaningless
without the man.

155
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:56,208
Long as it's empty, it's
nothing but a gilded chair.

156
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,041
[EMILIO]
Then, why is it needed?

157
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,916
[DEMETRIO] This castle,

00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,833
It's Ibelda! What do we do?

318
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:50,083
[IBELDA] Mm... I hoped I
would get you two alone.

319
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:56,291
We can take our time now,
have fun. [laughs]

320
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,333
Dammit, no.

[DEMETRIO] Shun! Emilio!

324
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,333
[IBELDA] Ha, ha!
Are you ready for your scar?

325
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:16,333
Is it just me, or is this guy
even crazier than he was before?

Emilio!

[GUIDORO]
Ibelda!

332
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,625
Get the hell out of my way!

333
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,250
We're not gonna
breakthrough in time!

334
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,500
This doesn't look good.

We're in trouble.

H'ya! There's glory
to go around still!

346
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,791
If the prince should
march to battle,

347
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,666
then so will his Royal Guard!

348

Hmph.

Don't strain yourself.

Heh. If I was afraid to give
my all, I'd have died long ago.

[SLIME groans]

00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:53,833
So this is what it's like to
fight with Endra on my side.

355
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,125
I don't mind it.

Let's go! [yells]

Huh?

00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,541
[EMILIO] Not deep enough!

[IBELDA]
Again? You've marked me again?

366

Piece of cake right?

Yeah.

--[SOLDIERS cheer]
--[SHUN, EMILIO gasp]

369
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,750
We've done it men,
the capital's safe!

370
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,208
I'm surprised they
made it out alive.

[AARON gasping]

372
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,916
[FELIX] I told you not
to strain yourself.

373
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,958
[AARON]
Uh?

[SOLDIERS laugh]

375
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,541
[SOLDIER 17A]
We did it! We really did it!

376
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,208
[SOLDIER 17B] We protected
the city! We're heroes!

377
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,916
[SOLDIER 17C]
We sent those monsters running!

378
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,833
[AARON]
It would seem I misjudged you.

379
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,333
You have my thanks.

380
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:06,583
Victory was only achieved
because you took the vanguard.

381
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,125
My men were frightened
to the brink of mutiny.

382
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,958
Till they saw you
march with the prince.

383
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,791
It's fine. Your job is
to protect the castle,

384
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,958
and you carried it out well.

385
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,625
I'd have done the same.

386
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:20,500
[AARON]
Hmph.

387

[SOLDIERS cheering]

388
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,416
[SOLDIER 17A]
Lift him up for all to see!

389
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,166
[SOLDIER 17B]
The hero of the battle!

390
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,000
[SOLDIER 17C]
All hail the prince!

391
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,250
[EMILIO]
Uh...

392
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,833
[SOLDIER 17A]
Amazing. He's gotten so strong!

393
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,291
[SOLDIER 17B]
Prince Emilio!

394
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,791
I saw you defeat the enemy
leader! I'm in awe, My Lord!

395
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,666
Check out Emilio's expression.

396
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,000
It's like he thinks
they're gonna eat him.

397
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,000
[ALICIA laughs]

398
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,833
He's managed to inspire faith
in the men around him,

399
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,083
but now he has to
prove he deserves it.

400
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,208
Early on, his light
was hard to see.

401
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,125
But it's slowly brightened
ever since we met him.

402
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,583
This one will go far.

403
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,500
I can't see it. But I hope
you're right anyway.
