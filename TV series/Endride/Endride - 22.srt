Huh?

[SHUN]
Damn that hurt.

6
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:19,541
Is this...?

7
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,166
No way.

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,500
[SHUN]
We're back!

9
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:25,625
[IBELDA] You! Where the
hell did you come from?

10
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:26,541
Get ready, Shun.

11
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:27,458
I'm with ya!

12
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,333
[GUIDORO]
Emilio!

13
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,125
[LOUISE]
Shun!

14
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,250
[SHUN]
Our friends are here too.

15
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,916
Looks like Dad wasn't lying.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,875
Your Parinblue brought us back.

17
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,666
[IBELDA laughing]

18
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,291
It's been too long since
the last time we played.

19
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:45,625
I'm glad to see that you've been
taking care of yourselves.

20
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:46,791
[SHUN]
That was close.

21
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,500
We could've shown up
anywhere in Endora.

22
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:49,875
Why'd it have to take us here?

23
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,291
You're asking me?

24
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,875
The thing's lodged in your
chest, why don't you know?

25
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:54,625
[SHUN]
Uh.

26
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:55,791
Explain yourselves.

27
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,125
How did you suddenly
appear from the sky?

28
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,958
Well, the surface is
pretty high up from here.

29
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,541
So I'm guessing we had
to fall a little bit?

30
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:04,916
So dumb.

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Wait, did you just say that
you were on the surface?

32
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:11,041
You can finish catching up once
I've sent you to your deaths.

33
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,291
We'll explain more later.

34
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:14,083
This won't take long.

35
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,291
[IBELDA growls]

[FELIX grunts, yells]

37
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,833
I can deal with these easily.

[LOUISE grunts]

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,500
You didn't have to do that.

42
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,500
We need to focus on
the battle at hand.

43
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,583
Yeah, I know.

44
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,541
[IBELDA yelling]

45
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:43,666
[EMILIO]
I'm sorry, Shun.

46
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,791
[SHUN]
Huh? What are you getting at?

47
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,375
[EMILIO] You finally managed
to get back to the surface.

48
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:52,208
But now you've landed yourself
in Endora all over again.

49
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,416
[SHUN] Did you just consider my
feelings? I'll be damned.

50
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,000
[IBELDA yells]

51
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,875
[EMILIO, SHUN grunt]

52
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,458
To be honest, I'm not all
that worried about it.

53
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,791
I mean, as long as I've got
Dad's crystal with me,

54
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,916
I can come and go as I please.

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,291
Maybe, but if I were you,
I wouldn't get my hopes up

56
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,250
until I'd worked out how to
activate that thing at will.

57
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,750
Dude. You're a killjoy.

58
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,125
I'm sure I can figure it. I just
need to practice a little.

59
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,541
What is this?

60
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,000
We're reunited at last and
you completely ignore me?

61
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,416
Pay attention so I can drink
the fear from your eyes

62
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,583
while I kill you!

63
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,750
You'll get yours!

64
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,083
But the more you interrupt us,

65
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,875
the longer you're gonna
have to wait for it.

66
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,250
[IBELDA]
What?!

67
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,291
You heard me: the world
doesn't revolve around you,

68
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,208
so deal with it!
Now wait your turn!

69
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,791
Stupid brat!

70
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,166
[BOTH gasp]

71
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,458
Not too bad for a rookie!

72
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:46,500
Forget them.

73
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,791
I'm the foe who
should concern you.

74
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,375
Your blood is useless.

75
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,750
And I've already proved
you can't stop me.

76
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:56,166
So get out of my way!

77
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,291
You've grown into
an abomination.

78
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,833
A blight that must be purged
from this world... by me.

79
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,208
I don't have time to
listen to you rant.

80
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:10,916
I have plans and they're with
those Endra brats behind you.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,375
They're the ones I want!

Let's go!

85
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:25,375
I'm gonna make damn sure
you die this time, Guidoro.

86
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,375
[EMILIO] You said you wanted
me and Shun, right?

87
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,458
[IBELDA]
Huh?

88
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,333

[IBELDA screaming]

94
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,250
Heh. About time we took him out.

95
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,416
Uh. What's up?

96
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,916
Something isn't right.

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,375
[gasps] Whoa. What's happening
to him? Did we do that?

98

[IBELDA groaning]

99
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,208
Hold on. Was that--

100
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,208
What's going on?

101
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:31,666
[ELJUIA groaning]

102
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,333
[panting]

103
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,583
Almost there...
Just a little further.

104
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:45,125
[ELJUIA screaming]

105
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,875
He's in pain.

106
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:47,625
Leave him be.

107
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,500
[gasps] I can't.

108
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,416
If you break his
concentration now,

109
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,125
he'll have suffered for nothing.

110
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,541
Yeah, I know. But still...

111
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,125
[DEMETRIO]
Eljuia knows what he's doing.

112
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,250
[gasps] Demetrio.

113
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,416
Connecting your spirit
to the pain of the world

114
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,583
is no pleasant task. Especially
if the world in question

115
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,541
is being slowly bled
of its life force.

116
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,916
Then why don't we stop him?

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,166
If he keeps this up,
who knows what'll happen?

118
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,625
You heard the screams.
Aren't you worried?

119
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,791
Of course I am, but this
was his choice to make.

120
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,583
We have comrades
throughout the continent

121
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,958
risking their lives
to protect Endora.

122
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,458
Eljuia has every right
to do the same.

126
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,583
So, uh... Is Ibelda
somewhere in there still,

127
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,541
or is that dark stuff
all that's left?

128
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,041
And why's there so much of it?

129
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,708
What are you asking that for?

130
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,083
We should focus on finding
a way to kill it.

131
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,791
Do you have any bright ideas?

132
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:10,541
Watch out.

133
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,500

Nice shot! Thanks.

136
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,000
[LOUISE] I thought you cut
him down. What happened?

137
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,250
Yeah, uh. It didn't quite work.

138
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,458
Be cautious.
He isn't just bigger.

139
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,291
Any vestige of sanity he
had left is likely gone.

140
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,875
He'll be completely
unpredictable now.

141
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,750
[SHUN]
That sounds about right.

Look, this isn't about you.

146

I won't go easy on this monster
just to soothe your ego.

I-I told you.

You didn't... need to do that.

It's like I said before.
I didn't do it to save you.

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,833
[EMILIO] Where are the
men I sent with you?

165
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,458
[GUIDORO]
They had wounded and casualties,

166
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,000
so I sent them back
to the castle.

167
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,625
I see.

168
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,208
We're no match for
this thing as we are.

169
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:15,041
We have wounded ourselves.
We should fall back too.

170
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,916
[GUIDORO]
Hmph. I think you're right.

171
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:36,333
[ELJUIA]
I am the seer, Eljuia.

172
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:43,208
I would commune with the
spirit of Endora's depths.

173
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,416
I beg for your counsel.

174
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,958
So that I might
help preserve you.

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,791
[ELJUIA]
Please, let your voice be heard.

176
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,458
And your pain be shared.

177
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,750
[ELJUIA]
Warp particles...

178
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,166
[ELJUIA gasps]

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,041
[ELJUIA]

180
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:36,958
[ELJUIA gasps]

181
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:37,666
[crash]

182
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,166
That's it, I'm going in!

183
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,541
Hey! Alicia, wait!

184
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,375
[ALICIA]
Oh, no! What happened?

185
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,458
[ELJUIA grunts]

186
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,708
[DEMETRIO]
Eljuia.

187
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,916
[ELJUIA]
Demetrio. You're here.

188
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,250
[ALICIA]
We heard you fall. Are you hurt?

189
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,000
Did you learn anything?

190
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:59,125
[ELJUIA] Yes. I called
to the spirit of Endora.

191
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,666
And my call was answered.

192
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,125
It showed me where the
Warp Particles have...

193
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,500
have been taken.

194
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,791
Tell us what needs to be done.

195
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,625
[ELJUIA] I'm sorry. All I can
tell you is the name.

196
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:16,083
It's called Tir Na Nog. Go.

197
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:16,916
[DEMETRIO grunts]

198
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,416
We'll handle it. You rest.

199
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,708
[DEMETRIO]
Well, doctor? How is he?

200
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:27,333
[DOCTOR 22A] He's about as
exhausted as I've ever seen.

201
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,166
And the only cure
for that is rest.

202
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,625
[PASCAL] Demetrio. Can I
borrow you for a moment?

203
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,333
[PASCAL] I've confirmed the
information Eljuia gave us.

204
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,625
The Warp Particles
aren't just disappearing.

205
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,541
They're converging
at a single point.

206
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,958
They wouldn't do this
on their own.

207
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,333
Something's pulling them in.

208
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,958
We can't be sure what
that something is.

209
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,291
But thanks to him,

210
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,000
we know exactly where
we have to go to find it.

211
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,833
[GRADIDO] Do we really have
no idea what to look for?

212
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,208
A creature? A machine?

213
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,000
[RODNEY] This thing can
draw in Warp Particles

214
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,416
from across the continent.

215
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,583
I can't imagine anything alive
with that kind of power.

216
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,333
I would wager it's some
kind of a man-made device.

217
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,625
A construct like Babel, perhaps.

218
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,625
But the spot circled on
the map is in the middle

219
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,000
of the Great Sea. I doubt
something like this would

220
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,791
just be floating, but I don't
see any islands, either.

221
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:18,916
Fair point. It isn't possible
to build that far out at sea.

222
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,666
Not for us.

223
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,375
But this construct wasn't
made by us. It was them.

224
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,958
Hold on. What do you
mean by "them"?

225
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,916
The beings of Tir Na Nog.

226
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,666
[gasps]

227
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,958
[BOTH gasp]

228
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,458
That's my theory.

229
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,708
There is said to be an
ancient ruin in the sea.

230
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:42,041
A heavenly place, far beyond
the reach of mortals.

231
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,500
I don't know if they
were men or not.

232
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,125
But someone made the Parinblue,

233
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,958
and their civilization was far
more advanced than ours.

234
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,250
I've heard the stories
same as you.

235
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,958
They seemed farfetched.

236
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,541
There are those who
have the same doubts

237
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,250
about tales of the surface.

238
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,250
It's hard to believe
without seeing.

239
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,250
[RALPH] So we don't actually
know what's going on, right?

240
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,500
There's a chance that Warp
Particles just group up

241
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,875
every few thousand years.

242
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,875
It might all sort itself out.

243
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,208
There's no use talking about it.
Let's find Tir Na Nog.

244
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,375
If it's real.

245
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,750
I wouldn't call myself
convinced either.

246
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,291
I've heard nothing to prove
that this mystical ruin

247
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,416
is actually out there.

248
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,083
Eljuia's word is all
the proof I need.

249
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,708
I understand, but--

250
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:27,500
[SHUN] I'd bet money that those
ruins are real, if I had any.

Oh, thank goodness, how have
you been, are you okay?

We're fine.

Yeah, it's the others we
need to worry about.

Huh?

Apologies. I should not
have let this happen.

So, how bad are they?

aren't in danger, but...

263
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,000
Gotcha. What about Demetrio?

264
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,166
Well, he tries to stay
strong for everyone else.

Yeah. That sounds like him.

The two of you did well to
get back in so little time.

00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,958
I'm sorry for worrying you.

269
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,833
[ALICIA]
"Worry" is an understatement!

270
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,541
I was completely freaked out,

271
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,708
where did you two
end up this time?

Yes! I knew it!

[ALICIA]
Uh!

277
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,791
It had to be the surface.

278
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,750
There was no better explanation
for your disappearance.

279
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,000
Sorry if this breaks the
flow of conversation,

280
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,458
but I wanted to ask you about
what you said earlier, Shun.

281
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,625
Are you sure that it's all true?

282
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,750
I said what? I really
don't remember.

283
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,291
That there's an ancient
ruin in the sea

284
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,541
we should be looking for?

285

[SHUN]
Ohh, that.

286
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,250
All I know for sure is
that there's some kinda

up Warp Particles.

288

Honestly, it might be anything.

289
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,541
But yeah, it could
be in the sea.

290
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,583
[PASCAL] And you found
this out on the surface?

How? Is that where
they're being sent?

[SHUN]
It's fine. They deserve to know.

295

Your Warp Particles are
being stolen on purpose.

And we know who's doing it.

So you're saying his father
is the man who raised you

320
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,333
[EMILIO]
Uh. Uh...

321
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:15,875
Thought it over,

322
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,916
and I'm pretty sure I can do
more good here than out there.

323
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,541
Endora's in a pretty
bad way right now.

324
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,625
And sometimes I
feel kinda helpless.

325
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,166
I mean, what's the point in
trying when you're too weak

326
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,041
to make a difference?

327
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,666
But I'm not weak.

328
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,875
And there's something out
there that only I can do.

329
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,625
I'm sure of it.

330
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,708
So I won't follow you.

331
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,750
Just promise me that you'll
come back safe, okay?

332
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,041
I promise.

333
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,625
If you break it, I'll kill you.

334
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:45,875
Noted.

335
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:50,291
[SHUN] Hey! Less talk,
more shovelin', okay?

336
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,291
Kay!

337
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,500
[FALARION chirps]

338
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,250
[ALICIA]
Falarion.

339
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,666
[chirps]

340
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,500
Hello, Father.

341
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,458
All right, then.
Good luck. N'fly fast.

342
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,208
Just leave it to us, kay?

343
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,166
I trust that you'll
defend the castle.

344
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,375
[DEMETRIO]
Right!

345
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,666
Take care, Dad. Please
protect my friends.

346
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,875
I'll be waiting for you!

347
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,666
[roars]

348
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,291
Well, are we ready to go, then?

349
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:37,416
I think so. Falarion, let's go!

350
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,041
[ALL gasp]

351
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,291
What was that?

352
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,833
Trajectory's good.
It's right on course!

353
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:46,833
[IBELDA (SLIME) roars]

354
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,666
He's growing.

355
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,916
So this is what's
become of Ibelda.

356
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,750
I wouldn't wish such
a fate on any foe.

357
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,291
Everyone take your positions!

358
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,416
We can't let him
get to the castle!

359
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,208
Joseph!

360
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,250
Sir! Let's do this, guys.

361
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,166
Remember, it's just
like we practiced.

362
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,416
[AARON] Right! Take your
places in the forest.

363
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,541
I can smell the rot from here.

364
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,208
What a loathsome creature.

365
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,458
I don't get it.

366
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,625
How does he manage to
keep growing like this?

367
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,500
[IBELDA (SLIME) roars]

368
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,458
[DEMETRIO]
There's your chance. Get moving!

369
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,833
Falarion!

370
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,916
[gasps] That's a trap.

371
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,791
[PASCAL] Didn't really have
time to hide the thing.

372
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,416
We're lucky he's lost his wits.

373
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,708
[IBELDA (SLIME) roars]

374
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,583
[FALARION groans]

375
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,750
Falarion! Hang in there!

376
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,625
We're not gonna fall,
we're not gonna fall!

377
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,625
They're gonna fall!

378
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,583
Any idea how to cut them loose?

379
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,250
[roars]

380
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,541

381
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,541
[screams]

382
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,166
Uh! Pascal!

383
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,416
[EMILIO] Pascal!

384
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,416
Uh! Huh?

385
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,791
[EMILIO]
Hold on, I'm coming down.

386
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,000
[PASCAL]
No! Just leave me!

387
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,375
[EMILIO] Wait! What are
you saying, Pascal?

388
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,625
[PASCAL] I'm saying we
have a mission here!

389
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,958
That has to come first!
Understand?

390
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:42,583
I'm not about to let some filthy
monster get in our way.

391
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,625
Emilio... Shun...

392
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:49,625
The future of Endora
is in your hands.

393
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:54,666
[gasps]

394

[ALL gasp]

395
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,041
What did... he do?

396
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,750
[EMILIO]
Pascal!

397
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,916
