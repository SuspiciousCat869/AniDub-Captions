00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,041
[SHUN]
Nice.

00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,500
[SHUN lauhgs]

3
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:29,875
[SHOPKEEP 1A]
Just listen to you!

4
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,333
You're really into
this stuff, huh?

5
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:32,416
[SHUN]
What are those?

6
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,708
Are they the ones
that just came in?

7
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:34,916
Yeah.

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,500
[SHUN]
Awesome!

9
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,625
What are they called?

10
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,500
This one here's a rutile quartz,

11
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,875
and this beauty over here
is a garden quartz.

12
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,541
Pretty cool, isn't it?

13
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,875
Yeah. Do you mind if
I see what it feels like?

14
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:47,916
Of course I don't mind.

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,833
Well, not if you buy it first.

16
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,583
Aw, man...

17
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,500
I'm just messin' with ya.

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Here.

19
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,250
[SHUN]
Whoa.

20
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,625
[SHUN laughs]

21
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,125
[clock chimes]

22
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,166
Better hurry,
you're gonna be late.

23
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,416
Hey! I'll stop by
on the way home.

24
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,791
Hold it for me, will you?

25
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,708
You do know I'm running a shop,
and not a museum...

26
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,250
[SHUN]
Please just hold it!

27
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,125
No need to worry. It'll be here
for you when you come back.

28
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,500
[SHUN laughs]

29
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,458
Cool! Then I'll see you later!

30
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:33,125
[SHUN] I've been fascinated
by crystals for a long time.

31
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,375
The multi-faceted stones
have been an interest of mine

32
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,541
ever since I was little.

33
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,708
I still remember the feeling
I had when I saw one

34
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,666
for the first time.

35
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,583
Since that day, I've imagined
there were unseen worlds

36
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,375
trapped within each stone.

37
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,666
And if I stared into one long
enough, I'd be sucked right in.

38
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,291
The truth is, I think I was
hoping something like that

39
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,666
might happen.

40
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,166
[SHUN] Seriously, though.
I wish you'd been there!

41
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,000
I've never seen
anything like it.

42
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,208
The inside was awesome.

43
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,125
It's like it contained
a whole other world!

44
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,875
I'm gonna go ahead and guess
that you were looking at

45
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,166
a garden quartz?

46
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,000
You know that
without even seeing it?

47
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,041
Of course.

48
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,625
That's a retired
archeologist for ya!

49
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,625
Have you ever thought about
starting your research up again?

50
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,791
Sometimes.

51
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,000
No need to worry about me,

52
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,708
if that's why
you're holding off.

53
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm a big boy.
I can take care of myself.

54
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,083
[MOM]
Yes, I know.

55
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,125
Maybe I will in a year or two.

56
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,458
Guess what I found out today!

57
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,458
What's that?

58
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,041
The Moai statues
on Easter Island--

59
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,208
They're not just heads.

60
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,875
They've got bodies
buried underneath them!

61
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,041
Oh, really?

62
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,666
And they're sitting like this.

63
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,708
[MOM laughs]

64
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,708
Feet down at the
table, please.

65
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,291
Sorry.

66
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,625
[MOM] You looking forward to our
little celebration this weekend?

67
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,750
[SHUN]
I am!

68
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,333
We're gonna give Dad
a great birthday,

69
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,791
and I'll make sure
he actually comes home

70
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,791
to celebrate this year!

71
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,250
[MOM] I've been worrying
that he might forget it again.

72
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,708
You know how he is.

73
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,708
Well, I have been texting
him every day to remind him.

74
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,916
If he doesn't show, I'll just
have to sneak into the office

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,375
and drag him back.

76
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,000
That's very brave.

77
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,041
Thanks, Mom, I've got this.

78
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,208
[SHUN]
Okay, see you later!

Remember, today's the day.

Everything's all planned out!

81
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,958
Celebration starts at seven.

82
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,666
You'd better be there!

83
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,750
Don't be late, and don't
even think about forgetting.

Yeah, that oughta do it.

All right, Dad, see you tonight.

Let's go ahead and start.

00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,833
I'll chat with him
about punctuality later.

88

For now, why don't we eat?
I'm starving.

I'm sick of this!
I'm gonna get him.

00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,500
I told you, didn't I?

91
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,750
He's coming home if
I have to bring him myself!

have to call me "coward"?

So angry.

Avenging the former king,

Useless sentimentality.

120

You should have planned a coup
and tried to seize the throne.

That would've been

Oh, my!

I didn't realize how much
you looked like him.

133
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:28,958
[EMILIO]
Huh?

134
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,083
The late king, I mean.

135
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,833
It's so sad he's
not with us anymore,

136
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,375
but your eyes are
the same shade as his.

137
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,625
Are they really?

138
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:36,750
Yes.

139
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,583
Well, I wish they looked
like the new king's instead.

140
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:44,208
Maybe then I would
be as strong as he is.

141
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,291
Maybe so.

142
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,541
[MAID 1A] It hurts when he
speaks of the new king.

143
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,875
He doesn't know the man
was his father's enemy.

144
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,833
So the poor boy adores him.

[MAID 1B]
Isn't it terrible?

146
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,583
He's just so
innocent and trusting.

147
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,125
It's almost too
painful to watch.

148
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,083
[EMILIO]
I don't understand.

149
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,916
What do they mean?

150
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,916
[EMILIO] Around every throne
swirls a storm of chaos

151
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,333
and discord.

152
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,708
In their desire for power,
even family members

153
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,250
turn on each other.

154
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,291
It's almost common practice.

155
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:19,166
However, it's one thing
to know about that storm

156
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,541
and another to find
yourself in the heart of it.

It's almost time.

162
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,875
[SHUN groaning]

163
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,208
That freakin' hurt!

164
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,333
[EMILIO]
Hey!

165
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,583
How did you get in here?

166
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,083
[SHUN]
I have no idea.

167
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,166
What do you mean?
How can you not know?

168
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,500
[SHUN]
Calm down, will ya?

169
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,791
Gimme a sec.

170
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,916
I've got a lot to process.

171
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,041
Who are you and
what are you doing here?

172
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:32,916
[SHUN]
A prison?

173
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,791
So you're a criminal, then?

174
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,958
I see.

175
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,583
You're from the
surface, aren't you?

176
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,208
The surface of what?

177
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,791
What're you talking about?

178
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:42,833
You know what, never mind.

179
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,041
Just tell me how
to get out of here.

180
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,500
[EMILIO]
First answer my question.

181
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,416
I want to know how you got here.

182
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,000
[SHUN] I already told you!
I don't know!

183
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,958
One second I was
just suddenly here.

184
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,750
[footsteps approaching]

185
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:53,875
Not good.

186
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,333
[SHUN]
Why? What's wrong?

187
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,375
The guards are coming.
If they see you, it's over.

188
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,541
What do you mean?

189
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:59,583
[EMILIO] I mean
they're going to kill you.

190
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,958
Kill me? Why?

191
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,666
[GUARD 1B]
What's going on down here?

192
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,083
[GUARD 1C]
Identify yourself!

193
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,375
[GUARD 1D]
How did you get past us?

194
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,958
[SHUN]
Um... I didn't...

195
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,208
I think this is a
misunderstand--

196
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,541
[GUARD 1B]
I don't want to hear it!

197
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,708
[SHUN]
This is it.

198
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,500
I'm gonna die.

199
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,083
How did this happen?

200
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,500
A Warp Relic?

201
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,375
What are you waiting for?

202
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,166
[SHUN yelling]

203
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,708
No way!

204
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,875
Don't just stand there!
We need to go!

205
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,166
[SHUN]
Hey! Hold on a second!

206
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:15,791
[phone ringing]

207
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:16,791
Hello?

208
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:17,958
[MOM]
Hey, I'm looking for Shun.

209
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,583
Is he with you?

210
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,166
[SHUN]
Can't we just hide out here?

211
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,958
It seems like a
good enough spot to me.

212
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,458
[EMILIO]
That won't work.

213
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,875
Hiding's no good. They'll
find us no matter where we are.

214
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:28,833
[SHUN]
Seriously?

215
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,750
We have to leave the castle.

216
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,500
That wall doesn't exactly
look very easy to climb.

217
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,000
It's okay. I have a plan.

218
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,750
Shut up and follow me.

219
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,083
You shut up! I'm not gonna
take orders from you.

220
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,500
I'll do things my way.

221
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,750
All right, Excalibur,
give me strength!

222
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,875
[EMILIO] Do you want to
wake up the whole castle?

223
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,958
Put your sword away
and stop shouting!

224
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,125
Uh, what?

225
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,416
How does that work?

226
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,875
You can't even manage that?
You are clueless.

227
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,625
I can see I'll have
a lot to explain.

228
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,083
[SHUN]
About what?

229
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,750
For now, just think of the
most relaxing thing you can.

230
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,000
Then take a deep breath.

231
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,291
Okay, something relaxing.

232
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,125
The interior of
the garden quartz.

233
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,916
It's gone!
How did that happen?

234
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,583
What did you do with it?

235
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,416
Never mind. Come on!

236
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,416
Hey, stop running off
like that, would ya?

237
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,833
[EMILIO]
Here it is.

238
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,958
[SHUN]
That was cool.

239
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,166
How did you know
about that hole?

240
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,125
Did you put it there
yourself or something?

241
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,166
That's right.

242
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,541
Not a bad escape plan.

243
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,833
[IBELDA] And yet,
it's not going to succeed.

244
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,958
[SHUN]
Who's that?

245
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,125
Is he here for us? And what's
going on with his face?

246
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,583
He's a Zoozian.

247
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:56,875
And loyal to my foster father,
King Delzaine.

248
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,916
A Zoozian? What are
we supposed to do?

249
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,083
Get yours out!

250
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,458
You mean that sword?

251
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,666
Just do it!

252
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,583
But wait,
I don't remember how!

253
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,583
[IBELDA growls]

254
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,166
What are you waiting for?

255
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,458
I'm not sure how
I even made it appear!

256
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,166
[IBELDA growls]

257
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,125
I could use help!

258
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,833
I don't know what to do!

259
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,875
Maybe I should get rid
of the toothless one first.

260
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,166
[IBELDA growls]

261

[SHUN yelling]

263
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,791
You're gonna pay for that!

264
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,958
[IBELDA growls]

265
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,416
Stop standing around!

266
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,041
Filthy brats! Take this!

267
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:15,333
[SHUN, EMILIO screaming]

268
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,916
Watch it.
Our objective's not to kill.

269
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,541
The king's orders.

270
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,375
An unfortunate accident.

271
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,250
I didn't plan it.

272
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,916
[SHUN coughing]

273
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,166
Are you all right?

274
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,416
I've been better.

275
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
[SHUN]
Shouldn't we hurry?

276
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,250
They'll come after us,
won't they?

277
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,083
The tunnels down here are
only known by a few people.

278
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,250
First that hole in the wall,
now these sewers.

279
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,666
You seem to know a lot of ways
to sneak around this place.

280
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,958
What are you, a thief?

281
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,041
If there is a thief
around here, it's not me.

282
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,416
It's this kingdom's ruler.
King Delzaine.

283
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,833
Huh?

284
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,083
Never mind.

285
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,416
More importantly, how does
someone from the surface

286
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,458
come to have possession
of a Warp Relic?

287
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,041
A Warp Relic?

288
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,291
I can't really answer you if I
don't know what you're asking!

289
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,416
Where are we?
I don't even know that!

290
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,833
We are in Endora.

291
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,541
Endora?

292
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,041
I'm not cut out
for this kinda thing.

[EMILIO]
Come on! Keep it together.

297
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,208
[ALICIA] I had a feeling
you'd run away, Emilio.

298
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,833
Looks like I was right.

299
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,583
How did you know
I would be here?

300
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:51,541
Let's call it woman's intuition,
O Royal Prince.

301

[FALARION squeaks]

302
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,708
[ALICIA]
This a friend of yours?

303
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,625
No way! I hate this guy!

304
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,958
Did she call you "Prince"?

305
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,625
So who is he?
He's dressed funny.

306
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,791
A visitor. From the surface.

307
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,166
Huh?

308
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,625
