1
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:11,416
[GUIDORO]
We can't let Ibelda run rampant.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,041
I'm going after him.

3
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:13,958
[ALL gasp]

4
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:15,250
[SHUN]
Wait, what, by yourself?

5
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:18,166
You can't, he's way too
strong. He's a monster.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,500
And don't forget about those
creatures that fight with him.

7
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:23,208
If you fight him alone,
you'll be outnumbered.

8
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,250
[GUIDORO] It doesn't matter.
I have to try.

9
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,333
Well then I'm coming with you.

10
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,083
That'll still be
no match for him.

11
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:32,541
Think about our last
battle. Demetrio?

12
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:35,916
[DEMETRIO]
Mm. Felix. Mischa.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,083
I ask you both to assist Guidoro
and Louise on my behalf.

14
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:40,708
[gasps]

15
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,166
[FELIX] If that's the
task you need us for.

16
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:47,083
Fine, I'll do it.

17
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,375
Slow us down and
I'll cut you loose.

18
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,125
Duly noted.

19
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,875
Now we're talking. Ibelda
won't know what hit him.

20
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:54,875
It still isn't enough.

21
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:56,041
[SHUN]
Huh?

22
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,416
I appreciate the back up.

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,875
[EMILIO] Yeah. I only wish I
could join the hunt myself.

24
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:10,041
[GUIDORO] I know, but you
have burdens to deal with.

25
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:11,541
Building a future
for this kingdom,

26
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,041
to name the most obvious.

27
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,416
That's exactly what
Demetrio said.

28
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,208
[AARON]
Prince Emilio.

29
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:20,208
You have my word; your comrade
will come back alive.

30
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,833
[EMILIO]
Make sure you return as well.

31
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,250
[SOLDIERS]
Sir!

32
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,625
Until we meet again.

33
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,041
You always were bossy, but
now it's almost a cool thing.

34
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,000
Shut up.

35
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,625
[SHUN laughs]

36
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,375
This book could be useful.

37
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,125
I have my doubts about this one.

38
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:16,958
[PASCAL sighs] It was hard to
find any texts concerning Babel.

39
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,666
The trouble with
Warp Particle research

40
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,541
is figuring out where to begin.

41
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes, I agree.
The volume of literature

42
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,791
on the subject only
complicates matters.

43
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,041
Well, we knew what we were
getting into, right?

44
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,666
It'll be fine. With Rodney
and Alicia's help,

45
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,583
I'm certain we'll
find what we need.

46
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,833
That we will.

47
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,333
[ALICIA]
Here's the last load.

48
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,208
[RODNEY] Huh? Thank you, Alicia.
You've been a great help.

49
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,000
[FALARION chirps]

50
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,041
[RODNEY chuckles]

51
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,541
The field, look.

52
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,958
[FELIX]
All dead.

53
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,458
[GUIDORO]
How awful.

54
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:57,708
[MISCHA] Seems like Ibelda's
not our biggest problem.

55
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:01,791
True, but at least he's
one we can solve.

56
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,000
[DEMETRIO] We've received
reports claiming that numerous

57
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,875
areas of farmland
across the country

58
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:09,375
have dried up and withered.
Practically overnight.

59
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,083
Yes, but this isn't just
a matter of crop failure,

60
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,750
forests and grasslands seem
to be suffering as well.

61
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,625
For real? How come?

62
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,208
I would wager that this is the
first of many ways that the

63
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:24,083
loss of Warp Particles will make
itself known in this world.

64
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,250
It's all well and good to
bring an end to the violence.

65
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,416
But it won't mean much if we
all starve to death afterwards.

66
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,291
And is that to be the
fate of the farmers

67
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,500
who lost their fields?

68
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,541
Some of them had stores
to fall back on,

69
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,083
and we're helping out the rest.

70
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,208
But if the problem
continues to perpetuate,

71
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,625
supplies won't last for long.

72
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,541
It'll turn into a famine, then.

73
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,750
Even as we speak,
Pascal and Joseph

74
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,500
are doing their best to discover
why our Warp Particles

75
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,083
have been disappearing.

76
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,916
Until their work is completed,
the most we can hope to provide

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,291
is a little bit of
damage control.

78
00:04:56,375 --> 00:05:00,500
And maybe some peace
of mind for the afflicted.

79
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,125
[JOSEPH] There are a few regions
that have retained Warp Particle

80
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,916
concentrations. Perhaps these
people could relocate.

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,083
A good thought, but it could
only work in the short run.

82
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,666
It's purely chance those
regions have been spared.

83
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,541
Diminishment rates
aren't changing as

84
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,541
the particle count lowers,
so if we can't stop this--

85
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,458
Life is a fragile
thing down here.

86
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,250
if we want to ensure
it continues,

87
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,583
then we can't waste time.

88
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,083
[JOSEPH]
Agreed.

89
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,750
[SHUN]
Well, this sucks.

90
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,958
I mean, talk about things
taking a turn for the worse.

91
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,000
[EMILIO]
Shun.

92
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,000
Uh? That's a somber
face. What's up?

93
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,333
There's something we
should go check.

94
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:38,208
[SHUN] If you're gonna drag me
around, at least say why.

95
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,458
Can't you guess?

96
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:40,833
[SHUN]
Uh?

97
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,583
This is the exact spot where
you appeared in Endora.

98
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:48,166
Oh, yeah. So it is.
Is this a nostalgia thing?

99
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,333
[EMILIO]
Do you sense anything?

100
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,708
Like...?

101
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,000
[EMILIO] If this is the place
where you appeared,

102
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,750
it could be where you go back.

103
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,625
[SHUN] That's the dumbest
thing I've heard all day.

104
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:56,958
[EMILIO]
Just try it.

105
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,583
[SHUN] Come on, dude.
If it was as easy as that,

106
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,458
I'd've gotten home
ages ago. Sheesh.

107
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,666
Thought you brought me here
for somethin' important.

108
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,583
You heard the same
reports I did.

109
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,250
Endora's running out of
time, and quickly.

110
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,583
Soon enough, this really will
be the land of the dead.

111
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,166
There's no reason for you
to bear witness to that.

112
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,041
You should get back to the
surface before it ends.

113
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,416
[SHUN]
Hey! What's down here, anyway?

114
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,041
Any idea how deep it goes?

115
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,041
Maybe we could drop a torch
or somethin' and check.

116
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,083
Shut up and listen. I'm trying
to save your life here.

117
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,500
[SHUN] You shut up!
You need to stop tryin'

118
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,625
to solve my problems
and deal with your own.

119
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,750
[gasps]

120
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,125
[SHUN]
"The land of the dead?"

121
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,041
It sounds like you've
already given up.

122
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,708
[EMILIO]
I'm not giving up, I'm--

123
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:38,958
[SHUN]
Well then do something!

124
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,083
You're the prince! If
anyone can, it's you.

125
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,083
Fine, so what do you
think I should do!?!

126
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,750
Or do you not know either?!

127
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,708
As if you would listen! You'd
rather go cry in the corner.

128
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,708
[EMILIO grunts]
Bastard!

129
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,083
[SHUN gasps]

130
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,958
[SHUN laughs, yelps]

131
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,583
[EMILIO]
Shun!

132
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,958
[SHUN, EMILIO scream]

133
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,166
Are you all right, Shun?

134
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,333
Well, uh. I'm still
in one piece.

135
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,250
Uh?

136
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,875
Hey look! Stairs!

137
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,458
[EMILIO]
Good. Try to swing to them.

138
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,875
[SHUN]
That was my plan.

139
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,458
[grunting]

140
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,333
All right!

141
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,833
They're solid, so come on down!

142
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:24,083
[EMILIO grunts]
I wonder where these could lead.

143
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,333
No tellin'. They're part
of your castle.

144
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,833
I figured you would know.

145
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,125
[EMILIO]
Well, I don't.

146
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,291
[SHUN] There's the useless
prince I remember.

147
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,916
[EMILIO]
Shut up!

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,083
Unless you have some
climbing gear,

149
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,041
I guess we might
as well head down.

150
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,708
Yeah. Down it is.

151
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:44,083
To think that the dungeons
used to go this deep.

152
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,875
Feel free to say sorry. Man.

153
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,333
If you hadn't tried
to push me we'd be--

154
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,958
I'm sorry for overestimating
your ability.

155
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,791
Nice one. If these kept going,

156
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,750
d'you think they'd hit
the surface sometime?

157
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,208
[EMILIO]
Don't know.

158
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,666
[SHUN] Well it doesn't
feel like they do.

159
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,791
I'd say look,
but I'm blind here.

160
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,083
[EMILIO]
Same.

161
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,666
[SHUN] So what do you think
we should do now?

162
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,791
You're the one who grew up here,
so if there's a way out,

163
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,500
you oughtta know how to find it.

164
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:10,958
[FRAMA]
Who's there?

165
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,666
[gasping]

166
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,125
[BOTH]
Uh?

167
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,250
So, who is this guy?

168
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,750
A prisoner.

169
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,041
[gasps]

170
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,583
[EMILIO]
Tell us who you are.

171
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,958
Why should I acknowledge
your question when

172
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,500
you refuse to answer mine?

173
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:39,291
I am Emilio La--
My name's Emilio.

174
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:43,333
Emilio... Emilio...
That name's familiar to me.

175
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,208
[EMILIO gasps]

176
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,625
[FRAMA]
Or it used to be...

177
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,375
Who put you down here?
Was it Delzaine?

178
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,750
[FRAMA] No, it wasn't him.
It was King Alzerm.

179
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:53,916
[EMILIO]
Really?

180
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,541
King Alzerm was your
real dad, wasn't he?

181
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,083
Correct.

182
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:02,125
I am employed in this castle as
a servant. What did you do?

183
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,000
I fought in the
service of the king.

184
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:08,958
A short eternity ago, I was
the leader of the Truculent.

185
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,791
[EMILIO] And how did
you come to be here?

186
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:11,833
[FRAMA growls]

187
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,208
[BOTH gasp]

188
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,791
[FRAMA growls]
With one great blunder,

189
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:20,000
I brought the crown's wrath upon
myself and was cast down.

190
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,791
But I am ever loyal to the king,

191
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,166
and it was on his
behalf that I acted.

192
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,208
I would try the same
again, I swear.

193
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:27,958
What exactly--

194
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:32,666
[FRAMA yells]

195
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,625
[FRAMA]
I did not betray my king!

196
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,791
I think we should get a little
further back from this guy.

197
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,666
And having served him, what
do you think of King Alzerm?

198
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,208
[FRAMA] The King was an
incredible man. A great leader.

199
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:49,291
His ambition was second to none,
as befits a mighty ruler.

200
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,500
We of the Truculent
served him proudly,

201
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,708
happy to be both his
shield and sword.

202
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:58,125
Our loyalty was limitless. We'd
follow any order from our king.

203
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,750
Our only purpose
was to serve him.

204
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,416
The new Truculent weren't
nearly that devoted.

205
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,958
All right, then.

206
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,166
Let's say that the king was a
good man and you were loyal.

207
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,291
Why would he throw
you down here?

208
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,083
[FRAMA] Because he...
He became corrupted.

209
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,083
Turned into something he wasn't.

210
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,125
[gasps]

211
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,083
[FRAMA]
By a man...

212
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,041
Just one? Was it Delzaine?

213
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,083
[FRAMA]
Of course not!

214
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,000
[EMILIO]
So then who?

215
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:25,083
[FRAMA] He made a fool out
of everyone in this castle.

216
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,375
He disarmed us with his smile.

217
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,541
Undid us with the
sweetness of his words.

218
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:45,708
[FRAMA] That traveler... He was
equal parts vile and charming.

219
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,958
He went to work the
day we brought him in,

220
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,666
turning us into his pawns.

221
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,500
[DELZAINE] A corpse near
the castle will bring bad luck

222
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,333
and disease.
Deal with it, Frama.

223
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,500
[FRAMA]
Right.

224
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,958
[FRAMA] I believe he's
still alive, My Lord.

225
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,541
[ALZERM] Then finish what
nature couldn't, and go.

226
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,916
[FRAMA]
I shall.

227
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,791
Would you like to keep this
strange machine of his?

228
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,000
What?

229
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,541
He's from the surface.

230
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,750
Get him to the castle,
now, quickly.

231
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,291
Should we?

232
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:23,000
We don't know what a surface
dweller might be capable of.

233
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,708
He's just a man.
If he proves himself

234
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,791
to be ill-tempered, we can
always kill him then.

235
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,000
[DELZAINE]
As you say.

236
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:34,291
[FRAMA] My one regret is
that I stayed my hand.

237
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,833
I should have killed him as soon
as the king commanded me to.

238
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:41,625
And that would have
been the end of it.

239
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,375
Like everyone, I had heard
the stories of travelers

240
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,541
from the surface
appearing in Endora.

241
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,750
But I never truly believed them.

242
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:53,750
Certainly never expected
to find one myself.

243
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,458
Before long the traveler
made a full recovery

244
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:59,208
and was able to
set out once more.

245
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:02,791
He returned to the surface and
came back bearing gifts.

246
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:06,416
The king's fascination
swiftly grew into respect.

247
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,208
Too quickly, the traveler
gained his trust.

248
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,625
[ALZERM] So how is it that
you're able to travel freely

249
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,291
between our worlds?

250
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,875
[TRAVELER]
I fear I might bore you.

251
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,750
Suffice to say, it took
years of research.

252
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,625
Then I take it
you're a scientist.

253
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,000
I am.

254
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,333
[ALZERM]
Tell me everything you know.

255
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,000
As you command.

256
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,875
[FRAMA] That's when the traveler
gained the king's ear,

257
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,333
and began to feed it poison.

258
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,041
What tales did he tell?

259
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,750
How was this man able to
maintain Alzerm's interest?

260
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,791
He saw the king's
ambitious nature

261
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,291
and took advantage of it.

262
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,250
Alzerm had just
established dominion

263
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,750
over the last few independent
states of Endora,

264
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,083
and with the entire continent
united beneath him,

265
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,875
he sought to conquer even more.

266
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:51,333
And lifted his gaze
up to the surface.

267
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,750
[ALZERM]
This level of technology

268
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,916
is common on the surface?

269
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,041
[TRAVELER] Yes. Endora
is a marvelous place.

270
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,791
Beautiful beyond measure.

271
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,875
But thanks to advances
we've made on the surface,

272
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,416
my people have luxuries
that yours do not.

273
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,041
Oh? I would hear more
of these luxuries.

274
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,291
To name a few,

275
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,833
larged winged vehicles
that expedite travel.

276
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,250
Handheld tools that allow speech
to cross great distance.

277
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:18,166
And weapons more powerful
than you could imagine.

278
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,750
I can imagine much.
You've piqued my interest.

279
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,541
[TRAVELER]
Your Grace, if I may.

280
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,916
There is a proposal I
would like to discuss.

281
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,416
Wilderness abounds
in this world.

282
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,375
It's as if you never
thought to harness it.

283
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,500
To bend nature to your will.

284
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,000
You mean such a thing
is actually possible?

285
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,416
[TRAVELER]
Yes.

286
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,916
I've contrived a way involving
the science of my world,

287
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,041
and the Warp Particles of yours.

288
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,041
[gasps]

289
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,375
I have my doubts.

290
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,708
Is it not unwise to alter
the course of nature?

291
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,041
[TRAVELER]
As I was saying.

292
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,541
I could take the power
of the living world,

293
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,041
and place it at your fingertips.

294
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,458
[FRAMA]
That cur.

295
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:58,708
He always had the words to
bend us to his schemes.

296
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,041
[ALZERM]
Nothing?! You had one task!

297
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,583
How are you no
closer to reaching

298
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,208
the surface than
when you started?!

299
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,916
[RESEARCHERS gasping]

300
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,750
Leave my sight.

301
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,125
Uh!

302
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,375
[ALZERM] Useless fools have
no place in my company.

303
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,958
[DELZAINE]
Please reconsider, Brother!

304
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:17,250
These men have done great
work in every other field.

305
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,625
Don't make me
dismiss you again.

306
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:20,875
[RESEARCHER 18A]
Sir.

307
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,833
[ALZERM grunts]
Useless, the lot of them.

308
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,166
They cannot hope
to compare to him.

309
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,000
Permit me to speak my mind.

310
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,791
I fear we've forgotten the
words of our ancestors.

311
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,625
They warned us to
never deal lightly

312
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,625
with those from the surface.

313
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,250
[ALZERM]
Be silent!

314
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,208
[DELZAINE]
Uh!

315
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,500
[TRAVELER] Ah. So this is
what you call a Warp Relic.

316
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:52,625
Yes. You must not have
these on the surface.

317
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,916
[TRAVELER] No. The power to
draw in the energy around you

318
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,250
and shape it with your
own is exclusive

319
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,250
to the people of Endora.

320
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,791
It's magnificent.

321
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:02,916
[ALZERM]
Hmph.

322
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,750
[TRAVELER]
Your Grace. What say you?

323
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,958
I could combine the mighty
force you've shown me

324
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,666
with the technology
of the surface.

325
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,416
But only if you will it.

326
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,666
[gasps]

327
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,708
[ALZERM]
I will it.

328
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:15,916
[gasps]

329
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,208
[FRAMA] He fooled my
king with honeyed words

330
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,666
and promises of strength.

331
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,375
[TRAVELER]
Your Grace,

332
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,750
I think you'll enjoy what
I brought you today.

333
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:25,958
[ALZERM]
Mm?

334
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,083
And what might this do?

335
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,291
--[ALZERM gasps]
--[FRAMA] Wha--

336
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,083
How--? What is it?

337
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,291
[TRAVELER]
A weapon.

338
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,833
Here.

339
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,208
[TRAVELER]
It's called a pistol.

340
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,916
[ALZERM]
Can anyone wield it?

341
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,291
[gasps]

342
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,875
Show me what it takes
to kill with this tool.

343
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:57,958
[gasps]

344
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,750
I would happily instruct
you in its use,

345
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,416
but it might be safer
to do so in the Garden.

346
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,166
[FRAMA]
From that day forward,

347
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,083
my king was changed
beyond return.

348
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:13,000
Uh! Awestruck by the
traveler's display of power,

349
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:16,875
he became deaf to
any other voice.

350
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,000
Especially with Babel.

351
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,208
[BOTH gasp]

352
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,375
Babel? What did Babel
have to do with it?!

353
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,416
[FRAMA] It was that man who
told the king to restore it.

354
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,083
So it was Alzerm who
started rebuilding it?

355
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,416
[FRAMA]
Yes.

356
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
The traveler promised
that once it was complete,

357
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,541
Alzerm could go to
the surface as he did.

358
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,833
But that isn't all
that would go.

359
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,041
[EMILIO]
What else?

360
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,041
He wanted to siphon
off our Warp Particles

361
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,916
and use them on the surface.

362
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,583
[BOTH gasp]

363
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,208
[TRAVELER]
I believe that Warp Particles

364
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,666
are the reason why this
world is so verdant.

365
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,958
By manipulating them,

366
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,416
we could render snow-capped
mountains arable,

367
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,791
or reverse the effects
of over-farming.

368
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,375
You would become the king
who mastered nature.

369
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,166
Your name would echo
through the histories

370
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,791
of both our worlds forever.

371
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,541
Would this enable
us to exterminate

372
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,750
the dragons who live
in those mountains?

373
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:06,916
[TRAVELER]
Of course.

374
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,291
Don't do this. We depend
on Warp Particles

375
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,291
in more ways than
we could understand.

376
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,041
They shouldn't be
meddled with at all,

377
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,000
let alone shipped off to the
surface, never to return--

378
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,375
[TRAVELER]
Another superstitious myth.

379
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,291
Frankly, if it weren't for
outdated beliefs such as this,

380
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,000
I doubt that Endora
would have fallen

381
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,583
so far behind the surface.

382
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,125
Instead of dwelling in
the past with your dead,

383
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,708
seek out brighter
truths in the future.

384
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,291
Look rather to the golden
age of prosperity

385
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,500
that your country
is about to enter.

386
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,125
From the results I've seen you
produce, I don't doubt it.

387
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,208
But Brother--

388
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,083
I have decided!

389
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,583
[FRAMA] Lord Delzaine
had been suspicious of

390
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,708
the traveler's motives
from the beginning.

391
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,833
But the king was deaf even
to the words of his brother.

392
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,625
He was practically brainwashed.

393
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:55,166
[FRAMA] He'll ruin this world,
stealing our Warp Particles.

394
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,833
I won't allow him to
take Endora's soul.

395
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,541
[gasps] Stop!

396
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,958
Frama. That is your name, right?

397
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,208
What are you plotting,
you charlatan?

398
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,125
If you intend to
force my confession,

399
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,291
you'll need to use more
than stern words.

400
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,333
Convince me you're
advising the king with

401
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,583
the betterment of our
country as your goal.

402
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,208
And I will walk away.

403
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,125
[TRAVELER chuckles]

404
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,875
[FRAMA]
What do you find funny?

405
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,625
[TRAVELER] If it was
possible to convince you,

406
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,708
we never would've
come to this point.

407
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,375
Luckily, I don't care.

408
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,000
I've more important
things to do

409
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,875
than ease an old
lizard's worries.

[TRAVELER]
Supposing I told all.

413
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,916
Do you think the king would
believe your side of the story?

414
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,166
[gasps]

415
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,833
He sees you as little
more than a loyal pet.

416
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,958
And yet you dare to draw your
weapon on the man he's entrusted

417
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,541
with the keys to the kingdom?

to him? Frama, you cretin!

Have you lost your damn mind?

[FRAMA]
No! He's faking it...

You tried to take
my dear friend's life.

[FRAMA screams]

433
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,125
[EMILIO] So you've been down
here all these years?

434
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:43,208
[FRAMA] Yes, I'm sure they
thought I'd starve down here,

435
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:46,416
assuming I survived
the cut, and the fall.

436
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,041
Did you find out anything else
before you were dropped?

437
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,500
[FRAMA]
No.

438
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:53,208
Anything that might help us
to reverse what was done?

439
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,666
[FRAMA]
Nothing.

440
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,208
Could you tell me what the
traveler from the surface

441
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,375
looked like? Or do you
know his name at least?

442

His name? The name...

443
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,833
I don't... I can't remember!

444
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,041
If you noticed anything
about how he was able

00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,166
to travel between here and
the surface, please tell me.

[FRAMA] He had something,
but he kept it hidden.

Did'ja ever get a glimpse?

448
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,958
If I could find the thing that
he had. I could go home!

Wait, go home?

Yeah.
