1
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,166
This place. Where are we?

2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,666
[SHUN]
I'm back. I'm really back.

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,125
I'm back home!

4
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,541
Back home?

5
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:22,125
You mean we're on
the... the surface?

6
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,833
[SHUN] Damn straight!
That's the real sky up there!

7
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:28,916
And we're about to see a real
sunset! This is awesome!

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,583
There's no way.
How could this happen?

9
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:36,125
[SHUN]
I'm finally home!

10
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,833
[SHUN]
Well. This is my place.

11
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,125
Wow.

12
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,083
Can't believe I'm here.

13
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,000
[MAKIKO]
Hello?

14
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:20,875
Hi. Uh. Long time no see.
How have you been?

15
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:24,625
[crash, footsteps]

16
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:25,541
[gasps]

17
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:26,791
Hey there, mom.

18
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:30,000
Um. Sorry for pulling
that disappearing act.

19
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:33,250
I'm sure I must've
given you a scare.

20
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:37,583
[MAKIKO cries]
Shun! You're all right!

21
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,333
Sorry for making you worry,
but I'm perfectly fine.

22
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:44,083
What a relief. It's so
good to see you home.

23
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,791
[laughs]

24
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,125
Uh...

25
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,958
All right, mom, it's
good to see you too.

26
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,458
I'm a little
overwhelmed right now.

27
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,958
Mom, this is Emilio.

28
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,458
He helped me out while I
was stranded in his world.

29
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,541
Well...

30
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,166
It's more like helped
each other out.

31
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,000
And somehow, he ended up
coming back here with me.

32
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,041
From where?

33
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,125
[SHUN]
Oh. Well, uh...

34
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,833
I'll just say it.
This whole time,

35
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:11,833
I've been underground
in a world called Endora.

36
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,166
An underground world?

37
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,541
[SHUN]
Yeah, I'm guessin' that sounds

38
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,541
pretty far-fetched
to you, doesn't it?

39
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:18,916
But take a look at his outfit.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,958
No one from our world would
be caught dead in that.

41
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,541
Solid evidence, right?
Pure science.

42
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,291
There is nothing wrong
with my outfit, Shun.

43
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,958
All I'm sayin' is that the only
people who dress as weird as you

44
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,375
in this world are cosplayers.

45
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,000
How dare you compare me to them!

46
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,291
Who is "them"?

47
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,250
I don't know who cosplayers
are, you tell me!

48
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,416
Ah, geez, uh... Cosplay's
hard to explain.

49
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,208
[EMILIO] Don't think that
you can use my ignorance..

50
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,791
Aren't you two quite a pair!

51
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,458
I'm glad to see you made such a
good friend while you were away.

52
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,000
--He's not my friend, okay?
--He is no friend of mine.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,041
[SHUN] I've gotta admit,
I'm kinda surprised by how

54
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,125
not freaked out you are
to hear about this.

55
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,125
Don't get me wrong,
it's shocking.

56
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,708
But I'm an archaeologist.

57
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,958
This is hardly the first time
I've heard about a secret world

58
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,541
existing beneath us.

59
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,375
Now, ancient texts are subject
to interpretation, but some of

60
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,625
them seem to claim knowledge
of specific entrances to it.

61
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:15,541
The eastern Himalayas, Northern
Russia, and there's one more.

62
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,333
Around the north-western
border of China.

63
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,708
Then some people do
know about Endora.

64
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,083
So it would seem.

65
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,666
[gasps]

66
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,666
[MAKIKO] The majority of experts
say it's all fake, of course.

67
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,291
But there have always
been a few holdouts

68
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,416
who at least believed
it was possible.

69
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,458
[SHUN] And it sounds like
you must be one of them.

70
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,041
Yep. Or I was until
you confirmed it.

71
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,333
Your father believes it as well.

72
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,750
Dad, really?

73
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,250
Okay, but even if you figured
an underground world

74
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,416
might secretly exist somewhere,

75
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,750
you can't have thought
that's where I was.

76
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,958
That was our theory
as a matter of fact.

77
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,666
Wait, seriously?
I can't believe you two!

78
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,750
So I guess you didn't
lose your minds worrying

79
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,833
about what'd happened
to me after all, huh?

80
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:57,083
[MAKIKO] You cannot imagine
how panicked we were!

81
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,291
Since you went missing,

82
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,291
your father has spent
every waking moment

83
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,500
trying to find out more about
that world you were stranded in.

84
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:07,125
I didn't realize, sorry. I guess
he's at the office right now?

85
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,541
Yes, he's taken to sleeping
there to save time,

86
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,958
so I barely ever see him.

87
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,541
I doubt he's gotten better
about answering his phone.

88
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,583
Cool! You know what, I think
I'll go there tomorrow

89
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:16,625
and surprise him.

90
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,375
Would'ya care to tag along?

91
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,458
What else do I have to do?

92
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,833
I can't wait to see
the look on his face.

93
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,250
[doorbell chimes]

94
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,333
[DELIVERY GUY 19A]
Got a delivery!

95
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,666
[SHUN] Whoa! This is
the good stuff, too!

96
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,375
I thought you might
react like that.

97
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,541
I don't know too much
about the underground,

98
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,416
but I doubt it has great sushi.

99
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,625
Thanks for the meal!

100
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,500
It's delicious!

101
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,666
I've been fantasizing about
surface food for so long,

102
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,166
but tasting it is-- Uh.

103
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,208
What's the matter? Dig in.

104
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,000
Feel free to have
as much as you like.

105
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,208
We have plenty.

106
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,583
So this is what food's
like on the surface.

107
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,125
Oh yeah, this'll be the first
time you've eaten up here,

108
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,666
won't it?

109
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,166
You must've put a great deal
of effort into preparing this.

110
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,083
Someone did.
It's actually delivery.

111
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,500
[EMILIO]
A strange name for food.

112
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,916
[gasps]

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,625
[SHUN] Delivery just means
someone brought it to us.

114
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,791
She already said that
we call this stuff sushi.

115
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,750
I was raised with the
luxuries of a castle.

116
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:20,666
Yet, I've never seen
such a beautiful meal.

117
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,708
What?

118
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,166
Yeah, sorry it tends
to slip my mind,

119
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,416
but Emilio here's a prince
back in his world.

120
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,750
Wait, I'm hosting royalty?
I'm so sorry.

121
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,416
I would've found us something
better than delivery

122
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,666
if I'd known.

123
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,416
We could at least go out
somewhere if you'd like.

124
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,291
Don't worry, I can tell you for
a fact he's used to way worse.

125
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,458
This is a finely made and
tastefully decorated dish,

126
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,666
well suited for the
food it contains.

127
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,958
Yeah, I'm pretty positive it
came out of a factory, man.

128
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,208
This factory must
have great artisans.

129
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,208
These engravings are sublime.

130
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,541
On second thought,

131
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,458
perhaps it's for the best
that we didn't go out.

132
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,083
You're weirdin' out my mom
dude, shut up and eat.

133
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,166
This is high class sushi!
Eat it before it dries out.

134
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,458
You might as well be asking
me to eat a fine painting.

135
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,291
[SHUN sighs]
I give up.

136
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,791
Pretty dang good, right?

137
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,166
[EMILIO mumbles]

138
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,083
[SHUN]
Uh?

139
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,416
[MAKIKO]
What's he trying to say?

140
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,250
Probably that his mind's blown.

141
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,083
[EMILIO groaning]

142
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,583
Emilio?

143
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,541
[EMILIO] This flavor. I think
it might destroy my mouth.

144
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,583
My nose! It burns!

145
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,958
Wasabi?

146
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,583
[SHUN laughs] There wasn't
even any on it! Hey.

147
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:31,458
[EMILIO]
Mm?

148
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,000
Look, Emilio, it's totally cool

149
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:36,000
if you can't handle
the taste of spicy tuna.

150
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,791
It's fine. There are a lot
of children on the surface

151
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,541
who can't take the heat,
so don't sweat it.

152
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,833
You think you can goad
me just like that?

153
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,208
[MAKIKO laughs]

154
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,041
[SHUN]
Don't pretend you can take it!

155
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,791
[EMILIO]
Shut up!

156
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,916
[MAKIKO] So, I have to ask, how
did a trip to your father's work

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,750
end with you finding
another world?

158
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,500
And what was this Endora like?

159
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:08,416
Guess I'd better
start at page one.

160
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,958
Well, basically, I found a
weird crystal in dad's office,

161
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,916
and the next thing
I knew I was gone.

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,125
The first thing I saw
in Endora, was this guy,

163
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,333
and it turned out he had
plenty'a problems of his own.

164
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,833
There are all sorts
of people in Endora.

165
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,666
Most of them are basically
the same as us,

166
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,958
but there are also these
guys called Zoozians.

167
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,541
They're pretty different.
No two look quite alike.

168
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,416
[laughs] Would you believe
I flew on a dragon once?

169
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,458
The people aren't advanced,
but some have cool abilities.

170
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,250
They get 'em by summoning
these things called Warp Relics.

171
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,666
Believe it or not, I can do it
too. Not sure how that works.

172
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,250
You can what?

173
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,083
[EMILIO] He can materialize a
weapon from his body, as can I.

174
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,333
[MAKIKO]
A weapon?!

175
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,958
The first time we fought Ibelda,

176
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,583
I was shakin' so bad
I thought I'd drop it.

177
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,833
If we hadn't been able
to summon Warp Relics,

178
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,750
I doubt that either one of us
would've survived that battle.

179
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,333
Why were you fighting, Shun?!

180
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,666
Is this place really as
dangerous as it sounds?

181
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,708
[EMILIO]
No. It isn't always, but...

182
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:10,041
...at the moment, the whole
country's in a state of chaos.

183
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,625
[SHUN]
And following him around put me

184
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,791
smack-dab in the
middle of most of it.

185
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,541
If it was really that dangerous,

186
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,750
then you shouldn't
have followed him.

187
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:17,958
Why act so reckless?

188
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,416
[SHUN] I didn't have
much choice at the time.

189
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,541
I wanted to find a way home
more than anything,

190
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,000
but I didn't know
where to start.

191
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:28,000
Emilio was my guide there,
I needed him. A little.

192
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,208
But all that is in the past now.

193
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:36,125
You're on my turf here, so if
you wanna get home, you need me.

194
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,541
[EMILIO]
Very well.

195
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,750
I humbly request that you
repay the favor I am owed.

196
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,875
[laughs] Looks like the tables
have turned, doesn't it?

197
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,833
If you wanna ask
anything about the surface,

198
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,875
you'd better hope
I'm in a good mood.

199
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,791
[SHUN laughing]

200
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,916
Stop lording it over him, Shun.

201
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,041
Forgive his rudeness,
we raised him better.

202
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,375
It's fine, mom!
Emilio would talk to me

203
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,666
like this all the
time back in Endora.

204
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,916
[MAKIKO]
That's because he's a prince.

205
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,916
A bit of haughtiness is
to be expected of him.

206
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,500
[SHUN] Don't expect anything
from him. He's useless.

207
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,875
[EMILIO]
What's this?

208
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,583
You know, just one
of a million things

209
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,916
we have up here that
you've never heard of.

210
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,500
It's called a photograph.

211
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,250
They're like, instant,
perfect paintings.

212
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,250
[MAKIKO] They're great for
preserving little moments.

213
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:25,000
Thanks to photos, anyone can see
how adorable baby Shun was.

214
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:25,875
Here!

215
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,583
[SHUN]
Whoa! Stop, stop, stop!

216
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,541
Why are you showing
him that? Not cool!

217
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,500
You're not even
naked in this one.

218
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,583
Now simmer down.

219
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,875
[SHUN]
I'll simmer down when I'm ready!

220
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,708
And please don't pull
out those other ones.

221
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,416
[SHUN]
Gimme that. You've seen enough.

222
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,958
He gets red when he's
super embarrassed.

223
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,875
No more pictures, got it?!

224
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,875
[MAKIKO]
Hm... Can you not handle it?

225
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,250
[SHUN]
Mom!

226
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,750
I suppose the others
back in Endora

227
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,625
must be wondering
where we've gone.

228
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,875
Yeah, they're prob'ly just as
worried as my parents were.

229
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,958
[EMILIO] I can't stop thinking
about that crazy story we heard

230
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,208
from the prisoner.

231
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,458
[SHUN] About the traveler
from the surface?

232
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,541
Yeah, I wish we knew
the end of it.

233
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,791
The end is still on its way.

234
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:09,916
[SHUN]
Don't worry.

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,291
[EMILIO]
Mm?

236
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,250
My dad's pretty smart.
If there's a way to get back

237
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,541
to Endora, he'll figure
it out in no time.

238
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,416
[EMILIO] I hope you realize
how lucky you are

239
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,250
to have such loving parents.

240
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,833
Where did that come from?

241
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,250
[EMILIO]
Nowhere.

242
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,208
Well, I guess it's true.

243
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,833
My mom gets a little
kooky sometimes,

244
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,125
but she's always
been there for me.

245
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,541
And dad's pretty awful at
the whole being there thing,

246
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,750
'cause he works so much.
But that might just be his way

247
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,708
of showing that he cares
about the family.

248
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,166
I see.

249
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:41,708
Goodnight, man.

250
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:42,791
Night.

251
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:07,250
[SHUN] Are you... sure you
wanna go out in that?

252
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,458
[MAKIKO] I can run and grab
you something of Shun's.

253
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,291
I do appreciate the offer.

254
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,416
But I'm much swifter
in my own clothes.

255
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,958
If something happens...

256
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,375
Nothing's going to happen.
I told you, dude.

257
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,916
We're not in Endora anymore.

258
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,375
[EMILIO]
Well, I like to be prepared.

259
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,916
Fine. But don't take it
personally if I pretend

260
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,083
not to know you.

261
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,208
--[laughs]
--[EMILIO] Loyal, aren't you?

262
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,250
[SHUN]
See ya later tonight!

263
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,291
Uh.

264
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,958
If you're going
to act like this,

265
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,958
then just walk a few feet ahead.

266
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,208
Nah, you're like a kitten.

267
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,291
If I let'cha outta my
sight, you'll get lost.

268
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,875
[FRIEND 19A]
That you, Shun?

269
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:43,750
[SHUN]
Hey!

270
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,166
Feels like it's been forever!

271
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,250
Say, weren't you supposed
to be taking a break

272
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,000
from school to go travel
overseas, or something?

273
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,916
Uh! I guess my parents
came up with that story

274
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,166
when I went missing.

275
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,833
[FRIEND 19A]
So you're back! How was it?

276
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,791
Yeah, it was fun! [laughs]

277
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,166
Well next time,

278
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,541
send me at least a postcard
or somethin', will ya?

279
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:02,625
[SHUN]
Yeah, sorry.

280
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,375
Uh. Did ya bring back a friend?

281
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,375
Oh, yeah. You could say that.

282
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,291
[FRIEND 19A] I've never
seen clothes like that.

283
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,083
Where ya from?

284
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,250
Oh, nowhere, he's uh--

285
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,458
It's cosplay.

286
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,500
Uh.

287
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,666
[FRIEND 19A]
Ah, that explains it.

288
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,833
You're pullin' it off
pretty well, man,

289
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,875
that wig looks super real!

290
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,833
[laughs]

291
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,583
[FRIEND 19A]
Anyway. We'll see you at school!

292
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,875
[SHUN]
Later! [sighs]

293
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,875
Have I even explained what
cosplay is to you, yet?

294
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,708
No you have not, but it would
appear that if I mention it,

295
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,166
then I can dress
however I please

296
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,875
without anyone bothering me.

297
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,875
I guess that's the gist.

298
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,125
Ya know you're kinda
smart when you wanna be.

299
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,125
Let me guess, you expected
me to lose my composure

300
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,416
when confronted with
an unfamiliar world.

301
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,166
Yeah, that's pretty on the mark.

302
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,916
Your weaknesses are your own.

303
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,916
Hey! I did just fine!

304
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,375
Don't make me stop helping you.

305
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,791
[EMILIO]
Hush.

306
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,166
[inaudible]

307
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,000
This is nothing like Endora.

308
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,541
Bet you're startin'
to wish you could stay.

309
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,083
I have to admit that I
haven't felt so carefree

310
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,666
in a long while.

311
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,000
Knowin' that there's zero chance
of getting attacked here

312
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,083
does take the edge off.

313
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,958
It still doesn't make
any sense to me

314
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,208
that I was transported to
the surface along with you,

315
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:50,083
but I never imagined I
would like it this much.

316
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,791
You keep on talkin' like that,
I'm gonna think you like me.

317
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,083
[EMILIO]
Whatever.

318
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,083
[SHUN]
Okay. I had fun, too.

319
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:01,291
And regardless of the why,
I'm glad you're here.

320
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,958
Yes. I'll see if he's available.

321
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:10,791
[phone rings]

322
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:11,625
[ASANAGA]
Mm?

323
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:12,916
[click]

324
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,958
[RECEPTION 19A]
Shun is here to see you, sir.

325
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:18,000
[ASANAGA] Very well, then.
See him through, please.

326
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,708
[EMILIO gasps]

327
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,375
[gasps]

328
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,500
Yo, Dad!

329
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,875
[ASANAGA]
Shun.

330
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,708
Sorry for the scare.
Came back as quick as I could.

331
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,708
Yes, well I'm just
glad you're safe.

332
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:35,875
And who's this?

333
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,375
This is Emilio.

334
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,958
He's one of the people I met
while I was down in Endora.

335
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,208
[ASANAGA]
Endora?

336
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,375
The underground world.
You guessed it right.

337
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,208
You and mom.

338
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,791
You don't say!

339
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,041
It seemed like a long shot,
but some part of me just knew.

340
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,250
It's all as I expected.

341
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,500
[SHUN]
Dang it.

342
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,625
I was hopin' I would get
to surprise you with it.

343
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,291
[ASANAGA]
Oh, I'm surprised, all right.

344
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,375
I always am when one of
my theories is confirmed.

345
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,083
That's not what I meant.

346
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,416
[ASANAGA] Come! You'll have
to tell me the whole story.

347
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,083
Sure!

348
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,458
[ASANAGA]
I see.

349
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,791
That crystal must have enacted
some sort of spatial transition.

350
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,916
[SHUN]
Yeah, a spatial transition.

351
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,083
The crystal that pulled
you into this "Endora"

352
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,750
was actually discovered
by your mother,

353
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,333
back when she was still
an archaeologist.

354
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,416
I assumed it was special,
but a key between worlds?

355
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,791
It's unheard of.

356
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,333
Pretty amazing.

357
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,791
I'll investigate thoroughly
and let you know what I find.

358
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,500
I knew we could count on you!

359
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,708
[ASANAGA]
Sure.

360
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,708
[ASANAGA]
Emilio? You look troubled.

361
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,000
Is there anything you'd
like to talk about?

362
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,583
[EMILIO]
No. It's nothing.

363
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,958
It's too soon to know, but I
have some promising leads

364
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,541
on getting you home,
so don't you worry.

365
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,083
For now try to be patient.

366
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,416
I appreciate your help, sir.

367
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,625
Well, I know exactly how
worried your parents must be.

368
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,083
Since we got Shun back,

369
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,458
it's only fair I see the
same happen for them.

370
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:53,458
[EMILIO]
Uh...

371
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,583
Actually. The thing is--

372
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,000
[ASANAGA]
Huh?

373
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,583
[SHUN] Emilio's father passed
away a few years ago.

374
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,041
Oh, I see. Please, I'm so sorry,

375
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,625
my mistake, I didn't mean
to make you uncomfortable.

376
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,125
There's nothing to be sorry for.

377
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,875
Emilio's father was actually
the King of Endora,

378
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,541
up until he died.

379
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,583
We think that he was killed
by his successor, Delzaine.

380
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,625
But now Delzaine's been
assassinated too, so...

381
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,166
...there is no king.

382
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,416
I can only imagine
the resulting chaos.

383
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,583
This must be a difficult
time in Endora.

384
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,375
[SHUN] It really is.
And if anyone has the power

385
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,041
to make things better
there, it's Emilio.

386
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:31,250
[ASANAGA] Mm. All the more
reason to hurry then.

387
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,708
I trust that you'll keep our
lost young prince here close

388
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,208
by your side, Shun.
His safety is paramount.

389
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,291
Yeah! I'll keep an eye on him.

390
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,958
[ASANAGA]
I know you will.

391
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:44,166
[EMILIO]
This feeling. It's out of place.

392
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,500
Why would I feel so disquieted
from the sight of Shun's father?

393
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,958
What is it?

394
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:53,833
What could it be about this
man that feels so wrong?

395
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,416
[EMILIO gasps]

396
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,166
[SHUN]
It really is crazy, isn't it?

397
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,916
They made such a big fuss
about Babel back in Endora,

398
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,916
but here we've got a crystal
that does the same thing.

399
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,833
Uh. Hey, what's the matter?

400
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,375
[EMILIO grunting]

401
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,166
[EMILIO gasping]

402
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,916
[EMILIO] This memory.
What is it? Why is it back now?

403
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,416
Emilio...?

404
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,416
I almost have it back.
It's right there!

405
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,958
I'm so close to remembering!

406
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,208
Look, I don't know if you're
feeling sick or what,

407
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,833
but we should head
on home either way.

408
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,541
Mom can take care of you,
and I don't want her to worry.

409
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:41,916
[EMILIO gasps]

410
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,291
[EMILIO gasps]

411
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,208
[ALZERM] The final arrangements
have already been made,

412
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,125
my friend. As per our
earlier discussion.

413
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,208
[TRAVELER laughs]

414
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,791
[DELZAINE] There's a reason
why our ancestors warned us

415
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,541
against dealing with
the surface, Brother!

416
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,416
This conversation is over.

417
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,583
Please listen. You must
not trust Asanaga!

418
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:07,291
[SHUN] Emilio! Seriously.
Snap out of it, man.

419
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,541
Asanaga...

420
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,791
Uh!

421
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,291
That was his name.

422
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:16,375
The traveler who stole our
Warp Particles. It was him.

423
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,750
What are you saying?

424
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:18,375
[EMILIO panting]

425
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,958
Hey, wait up!

426
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,375
Slow down, will ya?

427
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,041
[panting]

428
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:43,333
[ASANAGA]
Hello. Did you forget something?

429
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:50,833
[SHUN] Hey, Emilio!
Leave him be, he's busy.

430
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,708
[EMILIO]
I found out the truth, Asanaga.

431
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,208
[SHUN]
Uh.

432
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,125
[EMILIO] Endora's existence
wasn't just a theory to you.

433
00:19:56,208 --> 00:20:01,625
Don't lie. You knew what that
crystal did. You've used it!

434
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,875
What the heck are
you talking about?

435
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,458
How many times
have you gone back?

436
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,875
How many times since
my father lost his life?

437
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,333
Don't do this, man.
He's trying to help you!

438
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,166
Answer me!

439
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,416
[ASANAGA]
What are you going on about?

440
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,708
[gasps]

441
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,916
It was you. There's no mistake.

442
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,541
You are constantly
causing me drama, dude.

443
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,291
Say something, Dad!
Calm him down.

444
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,708
I remember you abducting
Delzaine's baby.

445
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:43,791
[gasps]

446
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,166
After that...
You took my father--

447
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,541
[gasps]

448
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,000
No. Dad, why?

449
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,750
[ASANAGA]
Don't do anything rash.

450
00:20:56,833 --> 00:21:00,291
What are you doing,
Dad? Put it down.

451
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,416
You're not really
that slow, Shun.

452
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,958
Stop calling me that.

453
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,666
You aren't my son.

454
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,125
