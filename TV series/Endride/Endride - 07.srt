1
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,416
[SHUN laughs]

2
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,333
[SHUN]
Woo!

3
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:22,416
[laughs]

4
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,041
[SHUN]
I'm the king of the world!

5
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,000
[SHUN inhales]

6
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,750
[ALICIA]
You're acting like a little kid.

7
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,250
Haven't you ever seen the ocean?

8
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,541
[SHUN] Sure, but oceans don't
look like this on the surface.

9
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,583
They're not nearly as... green.

10
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,375
[DEMETRIO] It's actually
a canal, not an ocean.

11
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:50,583
Ametius is one of the biggest
port cities in Endora.

12
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,250
All sorts of things funnel
through here to the inland,

13
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:56,375
whether it be goods,
people, or information.

14
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,916
[PASCAL]
That looks like a seabird.

15
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,625
We'll have to cross the canal
to reach Babylon, right?

16
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,541
Eventually, but first we're
going to have to make a stop

17
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,250
at one of the islands out there.

18
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,666
[SHUN]
What for?

19
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,666
To try and recruit the Zoozians
that inhabit the island.

20
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,083
Oh!

21
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,708
So you guys have finally
decided to make your move, huh?

22
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,000
We still need to find
a ship and provision it,

23
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,000
but we should be able
to leave tomorrow morning.

24
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,041
Dude, we're going on a boat!

25
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,791
This adventure just got real!

26
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,666
[ALICIA] Geez, you're easy
to impress, aren't you?

27
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,708
Simple mind, simple pleasures.

28
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,208
[SHUN]
What's that supposed to mean?!

29
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,416
You calling me stupid?

30
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,458
[PASCAL chuckles]

31
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,041
[SHUN]
A bed! A real bed!

32
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,541
I'm finally gonna
get some sleep!

33
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,750
Oh, come on, you sleep
like a dead man

34
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,166
in the tent every night.

35
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,041
I do not!

36
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,375
Yes, you do!

37
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,750
Even plugging your nose
doesn't stop the snoring.

38
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,333
So you're the reason
I keep having dreams

39
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,083
about drowning, you jerk!

40
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,708
They're at it again.

41
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,291
If you boys
have so much energy,

42
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,041
why not use it to go out
and explore the city a bit?

43
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,666
Yeah! Sounds good!

44
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,000
[EMILIO] Go by yourself.
I'm staying here.

45
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,500
Did you get a look
at that seabird

46
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,125
that flew by us this morning?

47
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,541
Yeah. I've never seen
one like it before.

48
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,083
That's because their species
prefers colder climates.

49
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,583
Outside of mating
season, anyway.

50
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,708
I expect we'll find the
weather across the canal

51
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,291
to be very different.

52
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,541
Without some warmer clothes,

53
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,833
you boys will probably
freeze to death.

54
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:29,833
Aw, man...

55
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,958
I'm more of a warm weather guy.

56
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,208
I'm sure you can find
whatever you need in town.

57
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,583
Better do your shopping now.

58
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,291
Once we board the ship,
you're outta luck.

59
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,500
In that case,
I'm headin' into the city.

60
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,750
You coming, or you wanna
be a prissy popsicle?

61
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,416
I can take care of myself.

62
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,375
Unlike some people.

63
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,958
[PASCAL]
Go together.

64
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,333
This far from the castle,
no one should recognize you.

65
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,458
There's safety in numbers.

66
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,125
You're better off
not splitting up.

67
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,791
Thanks, but I think I'll pass.

68
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,125
Yeah. I'm sick of his dumb face.

69
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,666
The guys shouldn't go alone.

70
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,166
I'd better come
along too to make sure

71
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,708
they don't kill each other.

72
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,541
Besides, I'm pretty
good at haggling.

73
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,708
[EMILIO]
I told you not to call me that!

74
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,250
[SHUN]
Forgive me, O Mighty One!

75
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,833
Would you idiots
shut up and follow me?!

76
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,375
[ALICIA]
What about you, Pascal?

77
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,750
[PASCAL] I'll stay back and
rest these old bones.

78
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,166
Suit yourself.

79
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,958
Should we pick up some warmer
clothing for you, then?

80
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,333
Not necessary.

81
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,375
I have a marvelous invention
that should do the trick

82
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:22,833
quite nicely.

83
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,166
Okay. Rest up.

84
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,666
We'll see you before dark.

85
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,541
Good. Keep a close eye
on those boys.

86
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,791
Now...

87
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,791
I have preparations
of my own to make.

88
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,333
[SHUN]
Finally, a real city!

89
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,083
I was starting to think
this place was nothing but

90
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,375
backwards villages and
untamed wilderness.

91
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,083
I'm just excited that
we get to go shopping!

92
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,666
[ELJUIA] Hello!
Where are you three off to?

93
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,041
Going out on the town? What for?

94
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,708
Shopping for warmer clothing.

95
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:50,791
What about you?

96
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,125
There are some
people we need to see

97
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,250
to arrange our
passage out of here.

98
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,541
You know, Shun, you shouldn't
walk around looking like that.

99
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,791
Huh? Looking like what?

100
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,708
[DEMETRIO] Like you come
from a different world.

101
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,666
You stand out like a sore thumb.

102
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,250
Guess I kinda do, huh?

103
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,750
[ELJUIA]
I think I can help.

104
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,833
[ELJUIA]
There, now you fit in.

105
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,583
I think it suits you.

106
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,250
That was a quick fix. Thanks!

107
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,125
Of course.

108
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,958
Now go run along and have fun.

109
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,333
Shun.

110
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,083
You should buy an amit
while you're in the market.

111
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,375
The city's famous for them.

112
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,291
[SHUN]
Okay!

113
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,750
Be careful out here, Prince.

114
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,750
You don't want to get lost.

115
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,000
I won't.

116
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,041
[SHUN]
Ah!

117
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,875
[ALICIA] We have plenty
of time before dark.

118
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,875
Why don't we wander
around and explore a bit?

119
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,541
I vote we start with snacks!

120
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,375
Cool! What do they have?

121
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:41,083
[gasps]

122
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,458
There something wrong?

123
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,583
[SHUN] I don't think I
can buy anything with this.

124
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:45,916
That's a weird looking coin.

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,291
Money from the surface?

126
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,291
Agh! The only cash I've
got, and it's useless!

127
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,083
Emilio, will you
lend me some money?

128
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,208
I'll pay you back.

129
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,083
No way.

130
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,416
Help a guy out!

131
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,541
You're a prince.
You've gotta be loaded.

132
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,958
Nope.

133
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,208
I have no money.

134
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,416
[SHUN]
I think you're full of it.

135
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,375
No, wait... It makes sense.

136
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,000
I mean, why would he
need money in the castle?

137
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,416
So what good are you, then?

138
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,875
[EMILIO]
What was that?

139
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,291
[SHUN]
Whew!

140
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,291
For a second there, I thought
we were royally screwed.

141
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,291
You're a lifesaver, Alicia.
Thanks!

142
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,500
Sure! Don't mention it.

143
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,875
Although... You boys'll owe me.

144
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,000
And I'll be charging interest.

145
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,333
Those are creepy...

146
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,458
They're dolls people set
out on nursery windowsills

147
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,541
as protective charms for babies.

148
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,750
They ward off curses
and evil spirits.

149
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,625
[SHUN] Oh, yeah?
What about bossy jerkwads?

150
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,458
Are you talking about me?

151
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:35,375
No.

152
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,916
[EMILIO]
You are, aren't you?

153
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,333
What? No!

154
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,291
Anyway, what's that?

155
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,166
[ALICIA]
A local delicacy.

156
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,375
Nobody's there. Strange...

157
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,791
[ALICIA]
Emilio! You coming or not?

158
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,916
[SHUN] So this is the "amit"
that Demetrio was talking about?

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,250
We call these gyros.

160
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,583
[ALICIA]
Ametius is known for 'em.

161
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,625
You can't find them
anyplace else.

162
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,458
The sauce smells like...

163
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,958
Yeah, wow! It's teriyaki!

164
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,958
Six hundred endo for all three.

165
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,166
Right.

166
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,375
You might be the first
dish I've seen here

167
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,750
that actually
resembles decent food!

168
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,208
Come to papa,
you beautiful thing!

169
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,416
What's wrong? Don't you like it?

170
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,583
Yeah. I actually like it a lot.

171
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,041
Then why are you
making that weird face?

172
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,916
[SHUN]
I'm just glad it's not boar!

173
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,541
So whadja want the
notebook for, Shun?

174
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,208
To write down stuff
about Endora

175
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,458
so I won't forget anything
when I go back to the surface.

176
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,875
[EMILIO]
How cute! He's got a diary!

177
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:02,916
I should punch you!

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,250
Guys...

179
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,458
He took my knife!

180
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:15,958
Emilio!

181
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,916
[EMILIO] Hasn't anyone ever
taught you that stealing

182
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,416
is wrong, urchin?

183
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,125
[ALICIA]
Calm down, Emilio.

184
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,541
[LITTLE GIRL, LITTLE BOY]
Brother!

185
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:33,791
Run!

186
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,583
He's trying to
feed his family.

187
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,166
Would you like
something to eat?

188
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,875
You can have this if you want.

189
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,958
We bought more than we need.

190
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,708
They can have some, too.

191
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,250
How's that sound?

192
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,291
Yummy!

193
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,875
Can we eat like this every day?

194
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,458
[ALICIA giggles]

195
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,083
Thanks a lot.

196
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,708
And I'm sorry for
trying to steal from you.

197
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,000
[EMILIO]
You don't like being a thief.

198
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:05,625
If you know it's wrong,
then why do it?

199
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,625
[ALICIA] Because he doesn't
want his family to starve!

200
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,291
You think they're
the only ones?

201
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,541
There are so many
others like them.

202
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,541
So many families
that resort to stealing

203
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,500
because that's the only way they
can feed themselves.

204
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,291
That isn't so uncommon
on the surface, either.

205
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,958
[ALICIA]
Even back in Endora's capital,

206
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,583
there are people
struggling every day

207
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,583
just to make ends meet.

208
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,500
If my father hadn't
left behind his shop,

209
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,291
I would be in the same
situation as these kids.

210

[CHILDREN laugh]

216
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,583
Shun seems like
a pretty good guy.

217
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,166
I wonder if everybody from
the surface is like him.

[LITTLE GIRL]
Okay!

If they are, it might
not be such a bad place

00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,125
to visit, y'know?

Sure! Come on!

Well, are you coming?

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,083
You go ahead.

Well, we've got a ship now.

231
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,166
So it should be
smooth sailing from here.

Pun all you want, but the
hardest part is yet to come.

All we can do is believe
in the cause and keep moving.

It got dark quicker
than I realized.

A little girl...

Alone on the street after dark?

00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,208
Maybe she needs help.

about fighting a little kid.

Let go!

00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,166
Don't struggle.

275
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,833
[DEMETRIO]
I thought so.

276
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,875
That girl is an assassin.

[SHUN]
You're kidding!

00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,875
She is a murderer.
A professional killer.

279
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:25,000
For the most part,
assassins in Endora

280
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,541
are orphaned children.

281
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,791
Those born with Warp Relics
are snatched up

282
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,958
by black market traders.

283
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,958
They're trained to fight.

284
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,708
Then they're sold
to the highest bidder,

285
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:41,166
usually a noble
with deep pockets.

286
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,708
I don't know how
it's done exactly,

287
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,125
but they're brainwashed.

288
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,333
After they've been taken,
their trainers break them,

289
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,041
and the children are
taught that they must kill

290
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,666
in order to survive.

291
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,041
Their options are either
to eliminate their targets,

292
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,375
or be eliminated themselves.

293
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,375
If they fail or disobey,
death awaits them.

294
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,000
Before long, they aren't
really children anymore,

295
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,333
but efficient killing machines.

Don't let that fool you.

I think you're right.

You heard. She said,
"Kill the prince."

301
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,375
[ELJUIA]
So Emilio was her target, then.

302
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,333
Which means she was
probably sent by someone

303
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,916
holding a grudge
against the royal family.

304

[DEMETRIO grunts]

305
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,208
All right, then.
I'll kill you first.

306
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:31,041
[DEMETRIO] You're welcome to
try, but I doubt you'll succeed.

307
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,791
This is quite interesting.

308
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,541
It looks like I'm going to have
to step up my game a little.

309
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,791
[MISCHA]
I've lost...

310
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,125
[DEMETRIO] I'm not as
young as I used to be.

311
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,208
Let's wrap this fight up.
What d'you say?

312

I--

313
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:46,833
You are free to move on.
Forget your past.

314
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:50,250
The assassin inside you is dead.

315
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,333
There's no choice.
I kill or... die.

316
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,541
That's not true anymore.

317
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,250
Now you have the freedom
to choose how you live.

318
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,875
Don't worry. You'll get
the hang of it before long.

319
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,416
Freedom. I don't know
what that means.

320
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,125
Stick with us, and
we'll find out together.

321

If you choose to use it,
you have the power

to help change the world.

00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,416
But still, it's your
decision to make.

324
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,041
But I don't know...
how to be normal.

325
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,875
It's not too hard.

326
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,000
For now, just hold your doll.

327
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,791
And smile when you can.

328
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,083
[LOUISE]
Late again!

329
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:39,750
I wonder what super lame excuse
they're gonna have this time.

330
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,333
[door opens]

331
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,750
Where were you guys?

332
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,333
Wait, what the hell?

333
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,166
[DEMETRIO]
Sorry we're late, Louise.

334
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,833
We got just a little distracted.

335
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,416
[LOUISE] Is that girl a love
child of yours or something?

336
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,041
[FELIX] Who's the mother?
Is it Eljuia?

337
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,500
[ELJUIA] You aren't as amusing
as you think you are, Felix.

338
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,333
[DEMETRIO] As you've noticed,
our company has increased.

339
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,333
We're not so hard up we
need to start bringing in

340
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,708
little girls.

341
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,791
What's your name, kid?

342
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,750
[ELJUIA] She's a bit shy.
Give her time.

343
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,458
[DEMETRIO] Well? What is
your name, little one?

344
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,416
I'm Mischa.

345
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,625
[DEMETRIO]
All right!

346
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,875
From now on, Mischa's
one of the Ignauts.

347
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,000
Welcome, Mischa!

348
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,416
[ELJUIA]
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

349
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,583
[SHUN]
Really, they're nice.

350
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,708
[ALICIA]
At least most of the time.

351
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,208
Gimme a break.

352
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,375
[SHUN laughs]

353
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,333
[SHUN]
That's Louise for ya.

354
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,875
[PASCAL]
Oh good, you're back.

355
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,375
What's all the commotion about?

356
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,875
[ALICIA]
Hey, Pascal!

357
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,125
Who's that?

358
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,666
The recruits sure are
young these days.

359
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,000
I have to be leaving soon,

360
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,583
but I'm sure these three
will look after you.

361
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,541
[PASCAL]
What did you think of the city?

362
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:52,750
Well, I...
I was really surprised.

363
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:56,916
Living in the castle, I didn't
realize things were that bad.

364
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:03,125
Something has to change.
It's not right.

365
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,458
[PASCAL]
I agree with you.

366
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,458
[EMILIO] You're really
going back to the castle?

367
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,708
[PASCAL] Yeah. There's
something I need to look into.

368
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,416
And I think I'm going to need
access to the Royal Laboratory

369
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,875
in order to do it.

370
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,375
[EMILIO]
Oh.

371
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,083
Don't worry, I'll
catch up with you guys

372
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,250
when I'm done.

373
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,041
I look forward to
analyzing the changes

374
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,875
that occur in you
while I'm gone.

375
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,250
It's not like I'm one
of your experiments.

376
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,000
Course not!
I'm saying that as a friend.

377
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,916
See you all soon!

378
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,833
Take care of yourself!

379
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,208
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do!

380
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,416
And off he goes.

381
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,333
[DEMETRIO]
Hey. We need to get going, too.

382
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,958
Yeah! Adventure, here we come!

383
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,208
Woo-hoo!

384
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,958
[ELJUIA]
