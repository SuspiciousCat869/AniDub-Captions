1
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,541
Look at that!

2
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,416
It's way bigger than I imagined!

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,250
[ELJUIA]
Ancient Babylon.

4
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,666
Ages ago, it was a thriving,
prosperous citadel.

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,125
These days, legends
are all that remain.

6
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,000
That it's inhabited by devils.

7
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,708
Or that it's a gateway
to the land of the dead.

8
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,166
Sounds familiar.

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,916
I've heard stuff like that
about Endora on the surface.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,583
So where is the entrance?

11
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:38,916
There are four.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,041
Each one of the towers
that you see here contains

13
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,875
an entrance of its own.

14
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:45,500
However, only one of them
will take you to Babel.

15
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,833
That's assuming this map
from the antique shop

16
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,708
is real and not a
well-executed forgery.

17
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,208
Which tower is it?

18
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,666
Does all that old
writing give any clue?

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,916
[ELJUIA]
Yes. I think so.

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,666
It mentions Zhurong,

21
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,458
god of fire and protector
of the south gate.

22
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,375
I believe that tower
is the one we want.

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,041
[SHUN] We're tryin' to
find some kind of key?

24
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,083
But how the heck are
we supposed to do that

25
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:55,041
if we don't even know
what it's gonna look like?

26
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,541
Over here!

27
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,666
[DEMETRIO]
Is this it?

28
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,041
That hunk o' rock?

29
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,666
Give it a try.

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,958
[SHUN]
Well, that was easy!

31
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:20,708
[ELJUIA]
This underground path

32
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,583
should take us
directly to Babel.

33
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:23,958
Sounds good! Let's go!

34
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,041
Calm down.

35
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,166
Mischa.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,625
[DEMETRIO]
If this is the route to Babel,

37
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,208
then there might be
booby traps along the way.

38
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,500
There's nothing there.

39
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,541
Thanks for checking.

40
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,458
I didn't do it for you.

41
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:40,541
[FELIX exhales]

42
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,291
All right, let's move.

43
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,625
[FELIX]
Look at these footprints.

44
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,750
They're still fresh.

45
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,583
It's Delzaine and his men.

46
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,708
It looks like they got
here before we did.

47
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,500
Let's hurry,
or we'll be too late.

48
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,791
Anyone see a door
around here somewhere?

49
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:04,458
[FELIX]
No.

50
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,375
[SHUN]
Uh?

51
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,875
[FELIX]
We'll have to climb that wall.

52
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:11,375
[SHUN]
What? You're kidding, right?

53
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,541
Can't believe I ever wanted
to go rock climbing.

54
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,500
What now?

55
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,666
I know! Hey, Falarion.

56
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,791
Why don't you get big
and fly us up there?

57
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:21,541
[FALARION squeaks]

58
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,333
[SHUN]
Uh...

59
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,708
It doesn't work like that.

60
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,791
Just thought I'd try.

61
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,958
All right down there?

62
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,083
Yeah. Peachy,
don't worry about me!

63
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,541
[EMILIO gasping]

64
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,250
Emilio!

65
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,375
You're damn heavy.

66
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,375
Man, that was close.

67
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:06,000
It was. I think you
just saved my life.

68
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,583
What?

69
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,458
I said, "you just
saved my life."

70
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,916
Uh. Whoops. Didn't
mean to do that.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,291
[EMILIO]
Hmph.

72
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,541
[DEMETRIO]
Hey. You two!

73
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:19,250
Quit screwing around.
Hurry up and climb!

74
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,791
[sighs] It can only
get easier from here.

75
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,458
I don't think we can
relax just yet.

76
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,291
First a giant wall
and now a maze.

77
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,958
I wonder what else we're
gonna have thrown at us.

78
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,458
Should be good to go.

79
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,875
What are we waiting for?

80
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,250
[DEMETRIO] I want to
make something clear.

81
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,583
Whatever may happen here,

82
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,958
I have no intention
of killing Delzaine.

83
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,750
[EMILIO]
What are you saying?

84
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:05,333
You've built an army. You've
allied with the Zoozians.

85
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:09,583
True, but the revolution I
desire is a bloodless one.

86
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,625
Yes, I understand that. But--

87
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:13,583
[DEMETRIO]
But what?

88
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,125
It won't work.

89
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,333
Do you really think Delzaine's
someone you can reason with?

90
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,958
That's not something
I can answer,

91
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,833
because while I know what
he's like as a king,

92
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,583
I don't know what
he's like as a man.

93
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,625
[EMILIO] He's a monster!
What more do you need to know?

94
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,083
Think about it for a second.

95
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,833
His death will mean a better
life for everyone.

96
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,291
Isn't that what you want?

97
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,250
Killing the king
won't magically solve

98
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,833
all the kingdom's problems.

99
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,333
I'm sorry, prince,
that's not how it works.

100
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,208
The army we've gathered exists
for one reason and one reason

101
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,875
only: to force Delzaine
to surrender the throne.

102
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,333
[EMILIO gasping]

103
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,458
[DEMETRIO] Why are you so
desperate to kill the king?

104
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,333
[EMILIO growls]

105
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,666
Fair is fair.

106
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,083
What right do you have
to ask for our help,

107
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,875
if you're not willing to
explain what you're after?

108
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,333
You need to be straight with us.

109
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,666
I want revenge.

110
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,708
Uh?

111
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,375
Delzaine isn't my real father.

112
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,791
He's the man who murdered
my father--the former king.

113
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,000
I seek vengeance for him!

114
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:15,250
I swore I would
do that long ago!

115
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,458
And now I have the chance.

116
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,541
So it's revenge.

117
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,416
That's actually what
I'm after, too.

118
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,041
Many years ago, a good
Zoozian friend of mine

119
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,875
was killed by a pompous noble.

120
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,041
[EMILIO]
Uh.

121
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,708
[DEMETRIO]
I trained hard so I'd be ready

122
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,375
to exact my revenge
when the time came.

123
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,583
But I grew older, and as I did,

124
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,375
I came to realize that
wasn't the right path.

125
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,041
Nothing would be
solved that way.

126
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:44,125
Blood cannot be washed
away with more blood.

127
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,791
I could kill the man responsible

128
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,833
but then his family would
come after me in turn,

129
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,625
and the tragic cycle of violence

130
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,625
would only have
been perpetuated.

131
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,416
So now, I seek revenge
against the world.

132
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,583
This revolution is
about avenging those

133
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,250
the world has mistreated.

I hope you're ready to
give me your answer.

as straightforward as that.

Unless I misjudged him,
I'm sure they will.

163

We must prepare the

fill the air with their stench.

the only way forward.

[FELIX]
We've come so far.

174

Whatever it takes, I will see
Demetrio's dreams fulfilled.

That is all that matters.

176
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:38,083
[MISCHA] Whatever it takes,
I will protect Demetrio.

Does Emilio seem
a bit off to you?

180
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,916
[SHUN]
Yeah, he kinda does.

181
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,666
[ALICIA] Maybe something to
do with what Demetrio said.

182
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,875
[SHUN]
Yep.

183
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,750
[ALICIA]
You must be excited, huh?

184
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:58,791
[SHUN]
About what?

185
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,416
Because we've almost
reached Babel,

186
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,833
so that means you get to
go back home to the surface.

187
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,541
[SHUN]
Oh. You're right.

188
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,916
It's strange.

189
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
When we first made it to
Babylon, I was so excited.

190
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:14,500
But then, something
changed. I think...

191
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,541
Hey, Emilio!

192
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,791
Yes, what?

193
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:24,041
Well, um... We've almost
gotten Babel.

194
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,500
Which means that, y'know, I get
to go home pretty soon.

195
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:31,125
But I made a promise to you, and
I don't want to go back on it.

196
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,041
So I guess what I'm
trying to say is,

197
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,875
well, I just want to
ask if you know, um--

198
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,291
Would you get to the point?

to kill your father?

Given my appearance, however,
I can live as an Endra.

300

And for that reason, I've
had it easier than most.

301
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:33,375
Still. I knew that something
was wrong with the world.

302
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,583
My father was skilled
in medicine.

303
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,708
And my mother was an
excellent seamstress.

304

Unfortunately, they were never
able to truly use their talents.

305
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,041
The Endras ostracized them.

306
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,458
My father because
he was a Zoozian.

307
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,458
And my mother because
she married a Zoozian.

308
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,125
They were forced into
awful work that no Endras

would ever think about doing.

310

see the injustice of it.

311
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,416
Yes, that sounds terrible!
But isn't that why you

312
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,208
rallied behind Demetrio
and joined the Ignauts?

00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,958
not something everyone
can afford.

322
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,541
Do it, Louise.

323
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,458
[gasps]

324
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,250
Well, this is goodbye, Eljuia.

325
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,750
You poor, pathetic fool.

326
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:35,500
[DEMETRIO]
Stop!

327
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,208
[LOUISE]
Uh? Demetrio!

328
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,708
[DEMETRIO]
If I had to take a guess.

329
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,583
You'll earn more for killing me.

330
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,208
So why not give it a try.

331
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,500
How do you expect your
revolution to succeed

332
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,416
when you can't even tell
who your allies are?

333
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,708
Shut up, you traitor!

334
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,333
I already knew it was you.

335
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,208
[LOUISE]
What?

336
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,750
I didn't know the motivation,

337
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,916
but I knew there was someone
leaking all of our movements.

338
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,916
[LOUISE]
Uh.

339
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,208
[DEMETRIO]
I wasn't sure at first,

340
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,791
but after the prince joined us,

341
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,458
it became clear that there
was a spy in our midst.

342
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,916
[LOUISE grunts]

343
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,583
[DEMETRIO] That's why I
kept our group so small.

344
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,583
Initially, I didn't
want to believe it.

345
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,125
But when we were ambushed here,

346
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:16,250
I knew it was true--that you
were the one who betrayed us.

347
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,875
[LOUISE growls, yells]

348
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,666
[LOUISE growls, grunts]

349
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,708
I am not playing
around, Demetrio!

350
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,166
I will kill you if
that's what it takes!

351
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,166
Do what you have
to do. Go on.

352
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,083
But...

353
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,000
[SHUN]
Listen, I can't do it!

354
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,375
Do what?

355
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,125
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna
help you kill the king.

356
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,041
You know, I had a feeling that's
what you were gonna say.

357
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,000
You get cold feet?

358
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:43,916
That's not it!

359
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,333
[EMILIO]
Then why back out?

360
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:49,041
I agree with Demetrio, you
need to talk to him first.

361
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,875
[SHUN]
Come on. Emilio?

362
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:57,041
[EMILIO] Leave me alone.
You don't understand me at all!

363
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,291
Emilio...

364
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,541
You're right, I don't.

365
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,833
I haven't been through
half as much you have.

366
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,291
But I know revenge
isn't the right choice,

367
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,958
no matter how bad you want it.

368
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,625
[gasps]

369
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:12,958
[gasps]

370
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:13,750
Don't do this!

371
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,250
Let go!

372
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:15,750
[SHUN groans]

373
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:16,875
You guys!

374
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,833
[footsteps]

375
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,375
[ALICIA]
Come back!

376
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,500
Ow.

377
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:24,666
Are you okay?

378
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,125
Yeah, thanks. But we
have to stop Emilio!

379
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,750
[CASTINA] My Lord.
We will begin the process

380
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,791
of activating the
gate of Babel shortly.

381
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,083
And it will remain open
for a limited time only,

382
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,416
so haste is essential.

383
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,458
Once it opens,
please step this way.

384
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,166
At last.

385
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,291
I have waited for this moment
for so many years now.

386
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,000
[EMILIO]
Delzaine!

387
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,125
[DELZAINE]
Uh?

388
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,666
Emilio.

389
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,833
[DELZAINE] Next episode.
"The Light of Babel."
