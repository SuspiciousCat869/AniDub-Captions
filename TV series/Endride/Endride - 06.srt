[GUIDORO]
Relax, Vestulse.

00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:23,125
The prince is nearly as useful
out of our custody as in it.

6
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,583
Let's proceed.

7
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:17,458
Hey. The heck was that light?

8
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,125
No clue.

9
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,833
But it was timely, huh?

10
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:23,708
Yeah.

11
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,833
[BOTH laughing]

12
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,666
So, uh... Any idea what
might've been the source of it?

13
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,833
[ALICIA]
Emilio, you jerk!

14
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,291
[SHUN]
Hey there! How'd you find us?

15
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,458
[ALICIA growls]

16
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,000
You'd better have
an amazing excuse.

17
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,166
I only left you two because...

18
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,000
Because you're an
inconsiderate jerk?

19
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,416
Anyway...

20
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,125
What did you boys think of
that incendiary light show

21
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,458
I put on?

22
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,000
I've discovered
a delightful metal,

23
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,500
which, when applied to heat,

24
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,791
emits a flame far hotter and
brighter than one would get

25
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,250
from burning wood.

26
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,500
Needless to say I found a
way to augment that property

27
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,000
by mixing the metal with a
highly combustible catalyst,

28
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,916
which not only sped up
the reaction,

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,875
but also resulted in a--

30
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,375
Sounds cool.

31
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,916
You'll have to fill us in
on all the details about that

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,500
sometime in the distant future.

33
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,166
Oh, I see. You youthful
types have no appreciation

34
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,791
for the nuance of science.

35
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,791
I must ask, both of you.

36
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,000
Why did you come?

37
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,083
What? Can you really
not figure that out?

38
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,291
We're your friends, Emilio.

39
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,000
We'll always come
when you need help,

40
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,875
even if you didn't ask us to.

41
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,125
Speaking of...

42
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,541
I'm curious about these
new friends you've made.

43
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,833
Where did the rest
of the Ignauts go?

44
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,125
A good number
fell in battle, or fled.

45
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,666
I told the rest to
split up and lay low.

46
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,500
So... What's with the professor?

47
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,875
Something tells me there's
more to him than meets the eye.

48
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,750
I'm nothing more than an
old tinkerer, I assure you.

49
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,208
Been retired for a while.

50
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,541
[SHUN]
Uh... Is it just me,

51
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,875
or do things feel a
little tense right now?

52
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,625
[EMILIO] I didn't expect
them to track me here,

53
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,666
but these two are
old friends of mine.

54
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,083
They won't bring any
harm to your cause.

55
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,583
If they're old
friends of yours,

56
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,875
then wouldn't that also make
them associates of the king?

57
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,000
[EMILIO]
Uh...

58
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,875
What's he getting at?

59
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,333
[DEMETRIO]
Let's go.

60
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,750
Wait... You're leaving?

61
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,125
[LOUISE]
As should you.

62
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,958
Hang around here, and you'll
be due for another visit

63
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,916
from the Truculent soon.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,125
Hey! Wait for me!

65
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,833
Shun! Slow down,
we're coming, too!

66
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,416
[DEMETRIO]
Let's rest there a bit.

67
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,250
Make some plans.

68
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,166
We've been dealt a blow,
but we aren't finished.

69
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:59,583
[LOUISE]
We'll catch you later!

70
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,708
Later? Can't we come?

71
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,583
[PASCAL] So these new
companions of yours...

72
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,083
What are they about?

73
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,541
[EMILIO]
Don't play dumb, Pascal.

74
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,833
You've already worked
that out for yourself.

75
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,875
[PASCAL] Then you've joined
a band of revolutionaries

76
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:32,333
who'll stop at nothing
to end Delzaine's reign.

77
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,416
[PASCAL]
Hmm...

78
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,125
It's true...

79
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,916
You really did attempt
to assassinate the king,

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,208
didn't you?

81
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,458
Now I understand
why you were hesitant

82
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,708
to tell me about your
trip to the dungeons.

83
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,041
I know you two never
saw eye to eye,

84
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,083
but regardless, I didn't
take you for the kind

85
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,458
to kill his own father.

86
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:55,833
He's not my father!

87
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,625
He's the man who raised you!

88
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,750
And I'll be the man
who tears him down.

89
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:04,250
I've joined these rebels because
we share a common goal.

90
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,458
I'll align myself with bandits
if that's what's required.

91
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:11,000
To avenge my father at last.

92
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,416
I'd understand...

93
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,708
If you were sure what
you've heard is actually true.

94
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,041
But you're not sure.

95
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,833
You can't be, because
no one knows what occurred

96
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:21,000
between Delzaine and
the king but Delzaine.

97
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,500
[EMILIO]
I know what I've heard.

98
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,375
And do rumors count as proof?

99
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,375
I taught you better
than that, Emilio.

100
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:31,666
Trial comes before
the verdict. Use reason!

101
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,375
Even if he did kill
the previous king,

102
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,708
we can assume that he
had some kind of purpose.

103
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,083
Not everything in this world
is black and white.

104
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,625
Don't you think it
would be worth knowing

105
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,041
what drove him to do it?

106
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,791
He wanted the king's
throne for himself!

107
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,458
He killed my father to
satisfy his lust for power!

108
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,083
[PASCAL] That's just the
assumption you've made.

109
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,708
You have no proof.

110
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,250
Has it ever occurred to
you to ask Delzaine himself

111
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,958
to tell you what happened?

112
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,000
The path of vengeance is simple.

113
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,041
But that doesn't make it right.

114
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,750
Before you take revenge,
you have to learn the truth.

115
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,583
[SHUN] I wonder what those
two are off talking about.

116
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,458
I'm sure it's
just a good scolding.

117
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,083
Pascal can give
some lengthy lectures,

118
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,625
and after what Emilio pulled,
he deserves one.

119
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:26,958
And so do you!

120
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,375
Why didn't you talk him
out of it when he told you

121
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,541
what he was planning?

122
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,625
I don't know; does it matter?

123
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,625
[ALICIA] Those people you were
with are trying to overthrow 

124
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,833
the kingdom. They're
willing to kill over it.

125
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,750
And Emilio's the last person
who should be around them.

126
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,500
Well when you put it
like that, I mean,

127
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,875
of course it's gonna sound bad.

128
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:46,375
Because civil war
is obviously a bad thing.

129
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,125
I get where you're coming from,

130
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:52,125
but the Ignauts are
good people. I think.

131
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,708
I wonder...

132
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,000
Did he tell you why he didn't
wanna bother asking me to come?

133
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,041
Huh? Is that
all this is about?

134
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,250
It sounds like you're just
mad at him for not inviting you

135
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,250
to come with us.

136
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,458
Idiot!

137
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,000
[FALARION squeaking]

138
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:09,416
[SHUN sighs]

139
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,416
Well that sure was awkward.

140
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,833
Like I care.
What does he know?

141
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,375
Emilio...

142
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,500
[ALICIA]
Emilio!

143
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,875
Huh? Oh, hi, Alicia!

144
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,916
Any trouble sneaking
in this time?

145
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,083
Nope! A couple of maids
saw me, but I'm too fast.

146
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,750
[EMILIO] They'll be mad
when they catch you.

147
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:45,916
They always are.

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,375
But exploring around
here is worth it.

149
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,833
[MAID 1A]
Alicia!

150
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,458
You know you're not allowed
to be inside the castle!

151
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,708
[MAID 1B] Let's not have
a repeat of last time!

152
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,250
Come out here!

153
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,916
Oh, Prince Emilio.

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,416
You haven't seen Alicia
around here, have you?

155
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,791
I have.

156
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,583
Looked like she was running
towards the east wing.

157
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,291
Your help is quite
appreciated, sir.

158
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,000
My, that girl can run.

159
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
[ALICIA laughs]

160
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,083
Thanks for getting rid of them.

161
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,333
No problem.

162
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,708
Although I don't really
understand what makes

163
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,250
this castle worth the trouble.

164
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,833
I dunno.

165
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,416
Usually I play in the forest,
but that can get kinda boring.

166
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,833
'Specially since there's
no one to play with.

167
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,416
That so?

168
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,291
I've actually been bored with
the castle for a good while now.

169
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,375
I've never been
to the forest.

170
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,125
It sounds interesting.

171
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,625
Come see!

172
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,416
I'll grab you before
the next time I go, 'kay?

173
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,458
You're gonna love it!

174
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,916
There're giant boars
and mushrooms,

175
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,208
and weird bugs and every
color you can think of!

176
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,833
This is gonna be so much fun!

177
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,250
Oh yeah?

178
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,500
[BOTH laughing]

179

[EMILIO grunting]

180
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,541
Emilio, why?

181
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,958
What are you doing?

182
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,958
[ELJUIA] I gave the
town a thorough sweep.

183
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:36,291
It doesn't seem that the Royal
Guard has any influence here.

184
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,666
[LOUISE] We were about
due for a bit of good news.

185
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,791
[DEMETRIO]
Still... We can't stay long.

186
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,625
Right. So what's our
next course of action, then?

187
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,125
First off, we
replenish our numbers.

188
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,791
We sustained more
casualties than expected.

189
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,333
And most of those
who weren't lost

190
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,666
are scattered about
the countryside.

191
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,625
[ELJUIA]
What of Emilio and Shun?

192
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,000
Shall they stay with us?

193
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,083
Do you still trust them?

194
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,458
We're not in a position
to turn away allies.

195
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,166
And I don't have to trust
the prince to see how

196
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,958
he might prove to be useful.

197
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,083
Besides...

198
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,333
Besides what?

199
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,791
[DEMETRIO] It might
have taken both of them,

200
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,041
but Emilio and Shun did
manage to hold their own

201
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,708
against a Truculent in battle.

202
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:16,083
That has to put them well ahead
of most of our current recruits.

203
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,458
And the other two?

204
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,000
We'll just have to
watch them closely.

205
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,166
[SHUN] Look, have you seen a
group of four weirdos around,

206
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,500
or haven't you?

207
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,250
Get lost.
I'm tryin' to close shop.

208
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,666
Just hear me out.

209
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,791
One of 'em has a big old
feather sticking out of his hat.

210
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,083
And there's this other guy
who looks a lot like a lady.

211
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:30,875
I was fooled.

212
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,291
No, haven't seen 'em.

213
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,958
[DEMETRIO]
You can let him through.

214
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,000
[SHOPKEEPER]
Huh?

215
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,750
This one's a friend.

216
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:37,791
[SHUN gasps]

217
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,333
[ELJUIA]
I see you came alone.

218
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,833
Where are the others?

219
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,208
Pascal and Emilio are
having some sort of argument

220
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,458
right now.

221
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,625
And somethin' happened
to piss off Alicia too.

222
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,416
So basically everyone's
mad and I'm tired of it.

223
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,791
Oh. Sorry I forgot to
introduce you earlier.

224
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,375
I think you'll
get along, though.

225
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,458
Don't fret about it.

226
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,083
So how exactly do you know them?

227
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,541
Well, I met them
through Emilio,

228
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,500
but they've been friends
of his for years.

229
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,500
I think maybe Pascal
used to tutor him.

230
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,416
Like back when he was
still the head of research

231
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,166
at the Royal Laboratory.

232
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,041
That's an interesting
line of work.

233
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,458
Yeah, anyway...

234
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,750
I'm tryin' to get to Babylon.
Know what I should do?

235
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,125
Babylon? Why?

236
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,708
It's where the only way
I have of getting home is.

237
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,500
And since Eljuia saw me
there in the future,

238
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,166
I figure I should stop wasting
time and go for it.

239
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,875
That is what I saw.

240
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,125
Look, guys, I don't really
care about politics or revenge.

241
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,041
I just wanna find
a way back home.

242
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,875
The road to Babylon
is fraught with danger.

243
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,916
[DEMETRIO] The waters
between here and there

244
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,500
are far from welcoming.

245
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,041
The people whose lands
we'll pass are even less so.

246
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,666
Take one faulty step,
and you'll be dead.

247
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,791
Dead? It's that bad?

248
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,416
Does that news frighten you?

249
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,708
Yeah. But that doesn't mean
I won't go through with it.

250
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,958
I have to get back
no matter what.

251
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,875
Dad's never around,
so mom's stuck worrying

252
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,583
at home by herself.

253
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,291
[DEMETRIO] As chance would have
it, Delzaine is going that way,

254
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,625
so we're heading
to Babylon as well.

255
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,125
He won't be half
as well protected

256
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,791
as he is while
he's at the castle.

257
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,916
We haven't had a chance
like this in a while.

258
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,958
I'll let you come with,

259
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,041
but don't expect us
to babysit you.

260
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,916
It's pure survival of
the fittest out there.

261
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,458
That's not a problem.
I can protect myself fine.

262
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,125
That's excellent to hear.

[EMILIO]
That so...

266
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,041
Sounded like you got a pretty
good scolding from Pascal.

267
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,458
He put ya through
the old guilt trip?

268
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,541
He tried his best to,
but he doesn't know

269
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,583
what he's talking about.

270
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,875
And you seriously
think that you do?

271
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,041
[EMILIO]
What?

272
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,750
Look, whatever it
is that Pascal said,

273
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,791
he said it 'cause
he cares about you.

274
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,291
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
bothered to come after us.

275
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,916
Sure.

276
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,416
Well anyhow, it's pretty late.

277
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
We should get some
rest while we can.

278
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:25,958
Demetrio and the others
have already started

279
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,083
setting up a campsite.

280
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,291
It's this way.

This isn't your fight.

There's no reason for
you to involve yourself

in what I have to do.

286
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,416

[ELJUIA] So how does this
contraption of yours work?

made it back.

getting along, at least.

00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,250
Nice to meet you, Louise.

320
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,208
[FALARION squeaks]

321
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,458
So tell me.

322
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,958
Do you plan to join us
for this little trip?

323
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,291
Yeah.

324
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,083
As long as Emilio's going
to go, I will as well.

325
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,458
Interesting.

326
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,916
Is there a problem?

327
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,208
Not at all.

328
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,666
It's just that I've
been getting sick of being

329
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,708
the only girl on
the crew, you know?

330
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,166
Well, I mean, it's pretty
hard to tell with Eljuia,

331
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,208
but the point
stands nonetheless.

332
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,166
What I'm getting at is that male
company can get annoying.

333
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,875
Which is why I'm
excited to finally have

334
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,625
another girl around
to suffer with.

335
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,041
I just wanted to offer you
an extra warm welcome.

336
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,083
Thanks.

337
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,375
But listen,

338
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,791
you and your friends
are plotting to overthrow

339
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,250
the kingdom, aren't you?

340
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,666
[LOUISE]
That we are.

341
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,166
Then why is everybody...
so positive?

342
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,791
It doesn't really seem to fit.

343
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,041
You thought we'd be all
conniving and bitter, right?

344
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,958
I mean, rebels are just
self-righteous bandits, really.

345
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,333
Aren't they?

346
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,083
Yeah, well...

347
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,666
When you get down to it,

348
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,791
there aren't a whole lot of real
differences between you and us.

349
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,291
If you change the
circumstances we grew up with,

350
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,000
our roles could
have been reversed.

351
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,916
By the way, Alicia.

352
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,250
If I'm correct,
Emilio is the heir

353
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,125
apparent of the kingdom.

354
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,875
[ALICIA]
Uh-huh. Yeah, he sure is.

355
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,333
So then who is that Shun kid
to be confident enough

356
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,208
to pick so many fights with him?

357
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,500
Honestly, there's not
much I could tell you.

358
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,291
I mean, he says he came
from the surface, but...

359
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,541
He can use a Warp Relic.

360
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,916
Huh...

361
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,125
[ELJUIA]
Oh, Louise!

362
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,708
Could I trouble you to
give me a hand with this?

363
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:17,916
Yeah, sure.

364
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,875
Sorry, dear, duty calls.

365
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,458
I like you, Alicia.

366
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,333
I think we're gonna
make great friends.

367
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,208
So what did you
need help with?

368
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,750
Demetrio wants us to pack
our essentials tonight.

369
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,041
Think you could help me
decide what's worth keeping?

370
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,625
[LOUISE]
Yeah, sure thing.

371
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,666
--What a weird girl.
--[FALARION squeaks]

372
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,625
[SHUN]
This is purgatory.

373
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,583
Emilio's way too
pouty to talk to.

374
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,416
And Felix is about
as chatty as a boulder.

375
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,041
[SHUN]
Maybe he's just shy.

376
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,666
Only one way to find out.

377
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,791
[SHUN sighs]

378
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,541
[SHUN]
Here goes nothing.

379
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,250
Hey, Felix, I was wondering...

380
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,250
What exactly did the king
do to make all you guys

381
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,875
want to depose him so bad?

382
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,333
His soldiers are tough.

383
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,750
What makes it worth
fighting them?

384
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,000
I'd like to know, too.

385
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:13,375
[FELIX] Throughout all of
Endora, injustice runs rampant.

386
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,666
Whether it be due
to race or money,

387
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,375
many are born without
a fair chance at life.

388
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,583
They have it hard
from start to finish,

389
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,166
offered nothing
but pain and cruelty.

390
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,416
Many of our comrades
are drawn from such lives.

391
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,208
That's why they come
to fight with us.

392
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,041
They're hoping
for a better world.

393
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,375
For the world that Demetrio
is working to build.

394
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,833
That's why I fight with him.

395
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,958
Change the world?
That's ambitious.

396
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,208
[SHUN]
Huh...

397
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,000
[FELIX] We'll cover more
ground if we split up.

398
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,916
You two look around that way.

399
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,875
I'll see you back at camp.

400
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,083
I guess we're
on our own, then.

401
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:07,125
[FELIX groaning]

402
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:11,083
[HOOLIGANS laughing]

403
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,625
[DEMETRIO] Seems to me it's
a bit late into the night

404
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,625
for you to be doing
a chemistry project.

405
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,041
[PASCAL] Yeah, not the
best habit I've picked up.

406
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,125
Though, I must say, it's not
entirely without its advantages.

407
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,250
Really?

408
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,541
Did you pick it up while
you were working

409
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,083
at the Royal Laboratory?

410
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,125
That was a long time ago.

411
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,541
Do you know what Delzaine
is trying to accomplish?

412
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:07,625
Afraid not.
I was just an employee.

413
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,625
[DEMETRIO] I can tell
you aren't lying, but...

414
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,375
I'd like to know
more than anyone,

415
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,666
but he's never once
stated his intentions.

416
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,791
King Delzaine is not
the kind of man who shares

417
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,583
the workings of
his inner thoughts.

418
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,208
Not to anyone.

419
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,875
Not even to his own son.

420
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,166
I can hardly blame
the king for that.

421
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,708
Our prince is
still a spoiled boy.

422
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:30,041
He has much to learn
before he'll be fit to be king.

423
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,958
[PASCAL] Like Rodney said,
warp particles would appear

424
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,708
to be falling in number.

425
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,458
Could this have something to
do with Babel's restoration?

426
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,625
All right! Everybody
get ready to move out.

427
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,666
[SHUN]
I can't stop.

428
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,333
I have to get
back to the surface.

429
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,000
