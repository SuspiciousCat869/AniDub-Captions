I'd need more data to say, sir.

[JOSEPH sighs]

6
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:35,625
We can use the plans I made as
a reference to locate any flaws.

7
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,791
Then review them at
the Royal Laboratory.

8
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,458
Right then. Good idea.

9
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,166
[PASCAL] It'll be no small task,
mind you. This is a big place.

10
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,416
[JOSEPH]
Oh! Problem, sir!

11
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
[PASCAL]
What'sa matter?

12
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,208
[JOSEPH]
I just remembered, I'm empty!

13
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,875
I'm running on fumes!

14
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,333
[PASCAL] Speak straight,
boy. What are you, hungry?

15
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,250
Alicia left some extra
food by the stairs.

16
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,583
That should tide you over.

17
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,041
[JOSEPH]
No, that's not what I meant.

18
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,458
It's not me who needs
nourishment, it's the jet!

19
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:00,625
I knew we were in a hurry,

20
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,708
so I wanted to minimize
our excess weight.

21
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,875
Not to mention, she can
only carry so much weight

22
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,041
when she has an extra passenger.

23
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,666
No fuel? That is a problem.

24
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,875
So it goes.

25
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,541
We might have gotten
here in style,

26
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,625
but we'll have to get back
the old fashioned way--

27
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:15,291
with the others.

28
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,750
[JOSEPH]
Guess so.

29
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,125
[PASCAL] On the bright side,
we can use that extra time

30
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:22,083
to consider the problem of the
diminishing Warp Particles.

31
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,250
[JOSEPH]
True.

32
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,625
I'm hesitant to be
overly optimistic here,

33
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,041
but with Babel defunct again,

34
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,583
do you think the problem
might solve itself?

35
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,250
I hope so.

36
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,250
[PASCAL] If the Warp Particle
count drops too much further,

37
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,166
It won't just be
life that suffers,

38
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,458
the very structure of
Endora could collapse.

[PASCAL gasps]

40
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,750
There's not too much to see
with those measurements.

41
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:47,750
We took them back when

42
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,833
concentrations
were still normal.

43
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,416
I'm missing something, aren't I?

44
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,666
Perhaps.

45
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,416
I can't help but notice
that the particle count

46
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,625
was perfectly normal

47
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,125
right up until King Delzaine
took the throne.

48
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,625
Whoa, that's right!

49
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,250
Are the dwindling Particles
and the King's rise related?

50
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,458
Although it's possible that this
could be a mere coincidence.

51
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,708
No way.

52
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,625
Correlation might not
show causation, but I...

[PASCAL] And now, I'll never
get the chance to ask

58
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,375
I don't think anyone could have
predicted how this went.

59
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,416
Yeah.

60
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,250

a proper mess.

[DEMETRIO]
Felix is right.

65

It's true that the king's
reign has ended.

66

But I wouldn't really
call this a victory.

for a bloodless coup

to get there without

00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,333
[SHUN]
Uh?

163
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,958
But if we defeat him, you'll
get to see your mother again.

164
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,750
You didn't start
me out at "kill."

165
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,333
Or mention that he was your dad!

166
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,208
It wasn't a fair deal!

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,791
Uh.

168
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:38,750
[EMILIO]
Yeah.

169
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,958
I didn't tell you much.

170
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,625
Delzaine had to go.

171
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,583
What more was there to say?

172
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,875
Back when we first met, revenge
was all I ever thought about.

173
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,833
Other people were reduced to
either tools or obstacles.

174
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:59,375
Ever since I was a child,
that's all that my life was.

175
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,625
[MAID 1B] It hurts when he
speaks of the new king.

176
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,041
He doesn't know the man
was his father's enemy.

177
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,750
So the poor boy adores him.

178
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,125
[MAID 1B]
Isn't it terrible?

179
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,541
He's just so innocent
and trusting.

180
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,250
It's almost too
painful to watch.

181
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,500
[EMILIO]
I don't understand.

182
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,250
What do they mean?

183
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,333
[EMILIO grunting]

184
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,583
[EMILIO]
It's almost time.

185
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:35,041
Soon I will end your traitorous
life with my own hands.

186
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,083
[EMILIO]
My father's enemy.

187
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,583
[gasps]

188
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,291
Emilio...

189
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,750
[DELZAINE]
That afraid of me?

190
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:05,625
Only a coward attacks
somebody in their sleep.

191
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,875
Who are you to talk?

192
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,125
What right do you of all people
have to call me "coward"?

193
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,583
So angry.

194
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,208
Avenging the former
king, your father?

195
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,166
Useless sentimentality.

196
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,416
You should have led a coup and
tried to seize the throne.

197
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,250
That would've been
a good way to die.

198
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,625
I wasn't the one to do it.

199
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,750
But Delzaine is
dead all the same.

200
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,916
One way or another,
the goal I set out with

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,166
has been achieved, so
why am I not satisfied?

202
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:38,041
Instead, I... I feel... empty.

203
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,708
It wasn't supposed
to be like that.

204
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,375
It was all wrong.

205
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,833
[IBELDA]
Foolish prince!

206
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,625
[EMILIO, SHUN groan]

207
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,166
Well, time to say goodbye!

208
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,958
You're in the way.

209
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,333
[DELZAINE gags]

210
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,500
[SHUN gasps]

211
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,916
Father, no!

212
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:09,083
You've become so strong.
I'm proud of you.

213
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,666
[EMILIO gasps]

214
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:26,083
[DELZAINE exhales]

215
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,625
I'm starting to think I
might've been wrong about

216
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,500
my father this whole time.

217
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:33,916
Whaddaya mean?

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,541
You remember when we were
holed up on that mountain,

219
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,166
during the blizzard?

220
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,708
When I told you about how
I used to idolize the king

221
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,708
before I knew what he was,
what he'd done to my father.

222
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:44,916
[SHUN]
Yeah.

223
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,291
[EMILIO]
After we had that conversation,

224
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,916
I spent a long time trying to
remember my real father. But...

225
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,958
...I came up with nothing.

226
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,666
No trace.

227
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,125
What are you saying?

228
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,958
When we first
encountered Delzaine,

229
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,666
he gave me this look.

230
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,333
There was something
nostalgic about it.

231
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,500
[SHUN] Not outside the
realm of possibility.

232
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,500
I mean, ya used to idolize him.

233
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,041
[EMILIO]
I know it might mean nothing.

234
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:15,166
But now, if I had it all wrong,
there'll be no way of telling.

235
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,875
It could be like Pascal
said, for all I know.

236
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,458
[SHUN]
Huh?

237
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,083
[EMILIO] When Pascal first
found out what I'd done,

238
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:25,125
that I'd tried to kill
Delzaine, we argued.

239
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,750
He didn't understand it.

240
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,125
He asked me,

241
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:31,333
"Was it really Delzaine
who killed the former king?"

242
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,375
He asked how I could
know that for a fact.

243
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,750
The only thing I
had was a rumor.

244
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:40,375
He maintained that this
was insufficient proof.

245
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,166
Nothing more than hearsay.

246
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,500
[SHUN gasps]

247
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,125
[EMILIO] Pascal only
said that to help me.

248
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,291
Alicia said the same things,
for the same reason.

249
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,166
Even Demetrio tried.

250
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,000
I should've known.

251
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,791
I should've listened to them.

252
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,166
But the only thing
I could think about

253
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,666
was my precious revenge.

254
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,125
I was so stupid.

255
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,958
I wonder where those two
ran off to this time.

256
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,250
[chirps]

257
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,125
I don't think we need to worry
about them too much, though.

258
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,583
As long as they're together
they'll be fine.

259
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,916
They make a surprisingly
good team.

260
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,000
[EMILIO] I should've
listened to you as well.

261
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,208
[SHUN]
Wait, when?

262
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,166
[EMILIO] When you tried
to change my mind.

263
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,250
[SHUN]
Uh--

264
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,666
You said that I should
talk to Delzaine

265
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,541
and find out what
really happened.

266
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,291
Yeah, I agreed with the others.

267
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,583
And you also said that
no matter how badly

268
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,791
I might yearn for it,

269
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,875
revenge would never
be the correct choice.

270
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,541
Said that twice.

271
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,791
So then you really weren't
asleep that one night.

272
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,083
No.

273
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,708
I heard every last word,
but I didn't listen.

274
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,541
And now I've paid the price.

275
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:01,083
Uh. Cut it out,
stop actin' pathetic.

276
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,166
[EMILIO]
But I am.

277
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,541
[SHUN]
Uh?

278
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,458
[EMILIO] You're totally
right, Shun. I am pathetic.

279
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,208
[SHUN] Oh, come on,
don't agree with me,

280
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,625
have some friggin' pride!

281
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,291
You're supposed to say somethin'
about how stupid I am.

282
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,791
It's what you do, man!

283
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,166
Huh?

284
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,875
Do you remember that
fight we got into

285
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,083
back at the Ignauts camp?

286
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,791
We had just joined up, but you
didn't think I should trust 'em.

287
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,958
It ended up comin' to blows.

288
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,500
Yeah. I recall it.

289
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,958
You should learn
to be a skeptic

290
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,000
before you get yourself hurt.

291
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,708
No one shares their
true intentions

292
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,250
unless they get found out.

293
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,625
But if you're always paranoid,

294
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,875
you can't trust anyone.
That's no way to live, man.

295
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,458
You've no right to tell
me how to live my life!

296
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,541
[SHUN] What the hell, dude?
You're even meaner than usual.

297
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,875
I get it, you're lashing out
cause you're gonna be lonely

298
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,458
once I go back to the surface.

299
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,833
Don't make me laugh.

300
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,416
It'll be a load off my shoulders
once I'm rid of you.

301
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,166
Of course, that's assuming you
can actually make it back.

302
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,625
[SHUN] You've got a real crummy
way of showin' gratitude.

303
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,541
I can't believe I
decided to help you.

304
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,583
[EMILIO]
So leave. See if I care.

305
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,041
Oh wait, you need my help so you
can run back to the surface

306
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,458
and cry to your mommy.

307
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,666
[SHUN] You are so mind
blowingly full of yourself!

308
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,083
You think I need you?
I saved your damn life!

309
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,875
You wonder why you don't
have many friends?

310
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,708
'Cause no one wants to help
a smug, condescending jerk!

311
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,500
You're like Demetrio,
but on opposite day.

312
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,208
[EMILIO]
What do you know about me?

313
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:23,625
Uh. Why would I want to know
anything about a monster

314
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,375
who tries to kill
his own father?!

315
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,875
[EMILIO grunts]
You bastard!

316
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,666
What?! Let's go, then.

317
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,958
[BOTH growl]

318
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,208

[SHUN]
Ah. That was a good time.

330
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,958
I was honestly a little
scared by ya right then.

331
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,541
Didn't think that one comment'd
set you off so bad.

332
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,166
Don't try to play it down now.

333
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,458
I seem to have a specific
recollection of you

334
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,625
dubbing me a "monster."

335
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,083
You know, I don't think
I've ever gotten along worse

336
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,166
with someone in my entire life.

337
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,625
Nor have I.

338
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,541
[SHUN] And yet the day after
that fight, you saved me.

339
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,750
Sure, but I didn't
do it for your sake.

340
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,958
For reasons unknown,
I had it stuck in my head

341
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,958
that you might prove
useful somehow.

342
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,375
Yeah, yeah, whatever you say.

343
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,583
I'm just glad that you
showed up when you did.

344
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,208
So, why aren't you
with the prince?

345
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,333
[SHUN]
I hate that guy!

346
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,166
You know you're
a smug little punk.

347
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,583
But I actually like
that about you.

Dammit! What am I doing?

351
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,166
It's not like I give a damn
what happens to him.

[IBELDA grunting]

00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,458
[SHUN]
He's too strong!

354
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,416
No way I'm gonna survive this!

355
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,041
[EMILIO] Would he come
running to help me?

356

[SHUN] It couldn't have
been anyone else?

361
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,125
[EMILIO]
Shut up!

362
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,791
[SHUN] Get outta here.
I don't want your help!

363
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,791
[EMILIO]
Stand up and fight!

364
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,666
[IBELDA]
H'ya!

365
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,833
Don't just sit there!

366
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,958
Quit bossin' me around.
I'm sick of it!

367
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,083
Let's deal with him
first and then fight!

368
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,791
[SHUN]
Okay, fine!

[IBELDA grunting]

You're gonna have
to get past me first!

374
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:19,958
Oh yeah?

375
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,875
Good, I don't care what
order I kill you in!

[IBELDA]
What?

381
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,208
Did his Warp Relic
really just evolve?

382

00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:56,333
That was some scary stuff.
Thought I was dead for sure!

386
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,750
That guy was crazy strong.

387
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,500
I've been wanting to ask you.

388
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,416
How is it that you
can fight so well

389
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,791
when you're from the surface?

390
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,666
[SHUN] Wait, what's that
supposed to mean?

391
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,750
For all you know,
we're all great warriors.

392
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:09,750
[EMILIO]
Are you?

393
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,083
Oh no, definitely not.

394
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,916
Where I'm from most people
have never had to fight

395
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,083
in their whole lives.

396
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,791
Were you some kind
of exception to that?

397
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,583
Nah, if ya get into
too many fights

398
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,041
you'll end up being arrested.

399
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,500
[EMILIO]
Hm...

400
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,958
I mean look, we still have
wars and soldiers up there,

401
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,458
but it was never somethin'
that I had to deal with.

402
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,375
That stuff was
always really distant.

403
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,708
You know?

404
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,375
[EMILIO]
I think?

405
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,833
Well, no.

406
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,583
Honestly, I can't imagine that.

407
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,875
[SHUN]
You wanna see it?

408
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,666
[EMILIO]
No. Not really.

409
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,791
But I would like to know why
Delzaine wanted to see it.

410
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:44,625
[SHUN]
Hm.

411
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,250
If only we had spoken more.

412
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,416
[EMILIO]
So. What will you do now?

413
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,500
[SHUN]
Hm?

414
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,625
The same as ever.

415
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,375
This one lead's a bust,
but I'm not givin' up.

416
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,708
There's at least one other
way down from the surface.

417
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,875
Could be more to get back up.

418
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,500
Besides, I'm startin' to work
up a taste for adventure,

419
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,125
meetin' odd people n' what not.

420
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,666
Once I get back to the surface,

421
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,875
I'm gonna write a
pretty sick novel!

422
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,333
Shun. You know, you--

423
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,083
[ALICIA]
Emilio! Shun!

424

[SHUN]
Hm?

426
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,916
We looked all over!
Where have you been?

[ALICIA]
Well come on down! I'm bored!

430
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,333
[SHUN]
Sounds like an order.

431
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,208
[SHUN]
Hey. Race ya down!

432
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,916
[EMILIO]
Stop doing that! It's not safe!

433
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,666
[SHUN]
What's the matter? You scared?

434
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,458
I'm not afraid, I would just
prefer it if you didn't fall!

435
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,208
[SHUN]
Sounds like you're scared!

436
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,333

[SHUN]
See?! I'm fine!

440
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,708
That's what ropes are for!

441
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,708
Uh. Shun. You're a fool.

442
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:57,958
[SHUN laughs]
I win. You comin' or not?

443
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,541
Sure.
