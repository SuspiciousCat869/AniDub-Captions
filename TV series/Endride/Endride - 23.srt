00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,750
What did... he do?

00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:28,208
[EMILIO]
Pascal!

3
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,833
Pascal, no!

4
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,458
[DEMETRIO] You have an
idea of where he fell?

5
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,583
[RALPH]
Yes. I believe so.

6
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,791
Good.

7
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,666
Then you take Joseph
and go look for Pascal.

8
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,916
We'll deal with Ibelda.

9
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:26,083
[JOSEPH]
Demetrio. Here, take this.

10
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,416
And this is...?

11
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,541
A powerful explosive designed
by Pascal himself.

12
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,458
Push that button on the top,
and it'll detonate.

13
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,083
You should be careful
when you deploy it,

14
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,666
but I think it'll come in handy.

15
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,708
Yeah. I think so, too.

16
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,541
All right, let's go Joseph.

17
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,500
We'll bring Pascal back.

18
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,000
Good. We're counting on you.

[DEMETRIO gasps]

20
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,875
I'm ready to put this
guy down for good.

21
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:56,291
No. Let me. I wanna end this.

22
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:09,625
[SHUN] It'll be okay. Pascal
wouldn't die that easily.

23
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,000
You know that.

24
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,416
Yeah.

25
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,541
It's like we're losing everyone.

26

[ELJUIA]
No one's lost yet.

27

[gasps] You're awake!

28
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,958
Don't cry. Let's pray for
everyone's safety instead.

29
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,583
Right!

30
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,125
I never thought my dad
would be the last boss.

31
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,791
Sorry, what?

32

He's like the king of all the
bad guys. The mega-villain.

33
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,833
Villain or not, getting revenge
against your father

34
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,666
for the death of mine
isn't what I'm after now.

35
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,750
The only thing that matters
is stopping the device

36

that's draining
the Warp Particles.

37

He can't be gone,

many things I need to learn,

so much knowledge
only he can pass on!

Not just to me.

52
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,833
Pascal's an invaluable
treasure to all of Endora,

53
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,625
one we can't afford to lose.

Uh. We have to find him!

He's still alive. I know
he is. He can't be dead.

It would take more than a fall

We have to stop him.

Mischa's all right.

She went with Demetrio and the
others to keep fighting Ibelda.

Okay. That's where I should be.

You were badly injured.
You don't need to go anywhere.

91
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:21,750
I must. If Demetrio's fighting,
I should be at his side.

That's why I'm here.

weren't for Demetrio.

So I've sworn my life
to protecting his.

to rest and heal.

you won't do anything
but slow them down.

Well, now that you've
decided to stay put,

00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,541
I have a very special medicine
that should help you recover.

my family for years.

liquid you were heating earlier?

Yes.

It smelled like you
were boiling socks.

You drink that stuff?

126
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,083
Of course. In fact,
I had some earlier.

127
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,041
That's the reason I made
such a speedy recovery.

Oh. Really?

129

I don't need any.

You're drinking it,

just making things up.

enormous up close.

I've never seen anything

I read fairy tales about this
place when I was a child.

of an omnipotent god.
Or so the tales say, anyhow.

You think that's really the best
use of our time right now?

163
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,791
[EMILIO]
Right!

164
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,166
[BOTH]
And now! [grunt]

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,291
Not a scratch!

166
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,291
Damn!

167
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:35,875
[EMILIO, SHUN grunting]

168
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,875
We can't even dent it.

169
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,041
Come on! Get back to work!

170
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,500
Hey, I am working just not with
my arms. I'm using my brain.

171
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,541
[EMILIO]
Oh, yeah?

172
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,125
The key is gem cleavage.

173
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,625
[EMILIO]
Did you say cleavage?

174
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,166
Crystals have a tendency to
split along distinct planes,

175
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,666
so the key to breaking
one is knowing

176
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,333
the right angle to
come at it from.

177
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,958
And you know what that is?

178
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:03,416
I think I do. Here. We jab
at it from straight above.

179
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,833
Like that! My superior
intellect saves the day.

180
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,875
So you're not totally
useless after all.

181
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,625
[EMILIO grunts]
Nice.

182
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:18,333
[SHUN] You know. If we destroy
this device, we'll be heroes.

183
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,208
People might name
babies after us!

184
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,333
[EMILIO]
You're kidding.

185
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,666
We are basically
saving the world.

186
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,708
[EMILIO] Maybe so. But I
don't deserve that title.

187
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,208
I'm no one's hero.

188
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,708
Stop already. I mean it.

189
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,541
You have a decision to make.
You know what you should do.

190
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,958
What decision?

191
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,666
Whether or not you're gonna
become king of Endora.

192
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,166
Uh!

193
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,333
[SHUN] Things aren't likely
to get better in Endora

194
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:46,125
until they've got a king in
charge. People need a leader.

195
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,708
I'm aware of that.

196
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,125
I just don't know if I can
be the king they deserve.

197
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:55,625
But for right now, what I can
do is destroy this device.

198
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,375
Then let's do it.

199
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,250
[BOTH gasp]

200
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,916
[EMILIO gasping]

201
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,166
My dad.

202
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:22,958
[EMILIO whipers]

203
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,500
Shun, enough of this.

204
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,708
[ASANAGA]
Haven't you guessed?

205
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,208
You aren't the only one
with a parinblue, Shun.

206
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,083
There is one inside
of me as well.

207
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,458
[gasps]

208
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,458
[ASANAGA] You and your friend
might as well give up.

209
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,833
That crystal is a special
device I constructed

210
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,333
inside of Tir Na Nog.

211
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:57,000
I will not allow you
to destroy it.

212
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,625
I don't care how special
that thing is to you.

213
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,541
It's destroying an entire world!

214
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:07,250
Parinblue, and Tir Na Nog.
No one knew.

215
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,458
Nobody on Endora or the surface
understood how to make use

216
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,750
of them properly
until I came along.

217
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,791
Everybody else was blind.

218
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,416
I saw their potential.

219
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,083
Our world on the
surface would be

220
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,666
a much different place
if not for that.

221
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,125
Must I explain it to you again?

222
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,416
Warp Particles are a valuable
resource to the surface world.

223
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,500
One we cannot afford to
sacrifice, no matter what.

224
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,333
Yeah, you've said that,

225
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,541
and, honestly, I get where
you're coming from.

226
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,750
[gasps]

227
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,666
But that doesn't mean
I agree with you.

228
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,708
[EMILIO]
Hmph.

229
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:42,083
Would you have said
that a week ago?

230
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,875
Back before you knew that you
were actually born an Endra?

231
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,208
[gasps]

232
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,125
[ASANAGA] I understand why
you would feel that way,

233
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,625
it's only natural.

234
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,083
But listen to me, Shun.

235
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,041
Your mother and I
raised you as our son.

236
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,125
You have never been anything
less than that to us,

237
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,541
do you understand?

238
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,833
No matter where you were born,
you're still our son!

239
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:02,041
[SHUN] And you're my parents.
Nothing will change that.

240
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,916
[ASANAGA] Then your decision
should be clear.

241
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,625
Come. We'll go back to
the surface together,

242
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,833
and you'll work by my side.

243
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,125
[SHUN]
My decision is clear.

244
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:11,958
Uh.

245
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,500
'Cause I already made it.

246
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:17,083
I won't let you sacrifice Endora
for the good of the surface.

247
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,125
[ASANAGA gasps]

248
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,833
You know what?

249
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:24,875
Try thinking about it as a
father instead of a scientist.

250
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,583
You must have come here a
lot using your parinblue.

251
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,916
So you saw for yourself
that this is a real world

252
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,333
full of real people.
Every last one of them,

253
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,708
Zoozian or Endra, is
someone's son or daughter.

254
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,625
And you're talking about
killing them all!

255
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,958
I don't get how you
can even consider it!

256
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:45,416
Shun. I'll give you
one last chance.

257
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,166
Will you side with your father,
as a son should... or not?

258
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,166
Shun...

[AARON gasps]

261
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,958
[DEMETRIO] We need to create
some sort of a distraction

262
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,625
to draw his attention away.

263
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:26,000
Then we can use this baby
to blow his head off.

265

All right.

We only get one shot,
so make it count, okay?

269
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,583
[GUIDORO]
Right.

Yes, I do. I have hope.

even more important than that.

[GUIDORO] You said something
to me before...

00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,833
That you didn't think of the
Truculent as your comrades.

[IBELDA]
And?

I thought it over, and decided
that I agree with you.

About the Truculent.

Thank you, friend.

Yeah. Demetrio must have used

00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,791
Was it from Demetrio?

322
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,625
[LOUISE] Looks like they
defeated Ibelda.

323
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:43,750
Really?!

324
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,000
Thank goodness.

325
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,000
Our people. Is everyone safe?

326
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,916
Not everyone.

327
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:57,000
[SHUN]
Dad. I'm sorry.

328
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:01,375
No. This isn't something
I can side with you on.

329
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:05,291
I see. That's very unfortunate.

330
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,416
Impossible.

331
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,291
What the hell? Is that thing--

332
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,791
That's right. You're looking
at my Warp Relic.

333
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,750
You can't have a Warp
Relic. You're a human.

334
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,833
[ASANAGA]
I have your dad to thank.

335
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,333
That's right, Emilio.

336
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,250
Good old Alzerm may be dead,

337
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,583
but that doesn't mean
he's gone completely.

338
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:31,916
[EMILIO]
What?

339
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,708
He lives on in me. Well,
part of him does, anyway.

340
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,166
Bastard! Killing him
wasn't bad enough,

341
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,791
you had to do this too?

342
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,708
You didn't. Dad, no!

343
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,916
[FALARION groans]

344
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,041
No!

345
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,333
Falarion! Enough!

346
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,625
[EMILIO grunting]

347
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,000
Please, Dad! Stop this!

348
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,791
I don't think so.

349
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,708
[SHUN yells]

350
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,083
[SHUN growls]

351
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,958
[EMILIO growls]

352
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,041
Are you okay?

353
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,583
[SHUN groaning]

354
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,333
[SHUN screams]

355
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,875
Shun!

356
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:47,916
[SHUN]
Emilio!

357
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,083
[gasps]

358
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,208
[SHUN] Come on.
We've gotta take him down.

359
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,541
Together we have a chance!

360
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,875
[EMILIO grunts]

361
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:45,958
[SHUN, EMILIO]
