It sounded like a
ridiculous plan to me.

But you showed me I was
wrong--that someday,

your dream for this world might
actually become a reality.

And if that day did come,
I wanted to be there.

in your dream too.

What the hell happened?
What was that?

324
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:17,958
[EMILIO]
Father!

325
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,166
Uh!

326
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,791
Emi... lio...

327
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,916
Can we help?

328
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,750
[footsteps]

329
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,625
What in the hell did
all of us just miss?

330
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,833
[footsteps]

331
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,375
[PASCAL, JOSEPH panting]

332
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,250
It can't be!

333
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:42,500
Emilio-- What? Your Majesty!

334
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:47,250
[PASCAL] Babel worked, but did
it function as it was meant to?

335
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,125
I still need to do
more research.

336
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:54,375
[sighs] I had hoped I'd be able
to ask King Delzaine something.

337
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:58,750
But, I fear I may
have come too late.

338
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:02,250
You've become so strong.
I'm proud of you.

339
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,625
[gasps]

340
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,125
[DELZAINE exhales]

341
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:30,125
I'm so sorry. [cries]

342
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,833
--[crying continues]
--[footsteps]

343
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,875
Why?

344
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,791
[SHUN]
We have many names for the place

345
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,333
beneath the surface
of the Earth.

346
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,000
It has been known over the
years as the underworld,

347
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:18,958
or Hades,

348
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,708
or Hell.

349
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:25,125
People speak of it as a place
of death, inhabited by demons.

350
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,666
But despite all those
frightening stories,

351
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,250
I've always been curious
about what Hades or Hell

352
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,291
would truly be like.

353
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,958
Actually, I kinda doubted
there even was an underworld.

354
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,375
I thought it was just a myth.

355
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,750
[SHUN]
Now here I am.

356
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:46,708
In this underground
world called Endora.

357
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:51,625
Whatever I was expecting,
it wasn't a place like this.

358
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,541
Not at all.

359
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,708
