1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,625
[SHUN] Now there's a ship
that's not gonna sink

2
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:13,000
at the first sign of a storm.

3
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:14,833
Supplies and a grand ship.

4
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:16,000
That's pretty generous.

5
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,041
We're allies now.
It's in my best interest

6
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,958
to see you're well-provisioned
for your journey.

7
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,625
At any rate,
thanks for all the help.

8
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:22,958
We're grateful.

9
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,958
[GRADIDO] There's no need
to thank me, friend.

10
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:28,083
We're all hoping we can get
through this without a fight.

11
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,250
But if your negotiations
with Delzine fall apart

12
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,958
and you need help,
use this to contact us.

13
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:33,833
A whistle?

14
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,083
[GRADIDO]
Give it a try.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,833
[SHUN blows]

16
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,625
I think it's broken.
It didn't make any sound.

17
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,916
[GRADIDO]
Patience.

18
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,583
Is this one of those
Endora bluebirds?

19
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,333
[GRADIDO] We use birds like
this to carry messages for us.

20
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:53,708
[SHUN]
An avian telegraph.

21
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,208
Whatever happens, don't
forget we've got your back.

22
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,166
Reach out to us and
we'll be there to help.

23
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,500
Yeah. I know I can
count on you, Gradido.

24
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,416
It's so cold!

25
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,125
I'm freezing my ass off here!

26
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,916
Shut up. Crybaby.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,250
You've gotta be cold.
How come you're not shivering?

28
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,958
I trained my body not to.

29
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,083
That's a neat trick.

30
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,041
I wonder how long
you can keep it up.

31
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,708
Think you'll make it all
the way over the mountain

32
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,208
without shivering?

33
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,625
[SHUN]
We're climbing that?!

34
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,708
I can feel my hands.

35
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,333
Hey. Move over.
You're hogging the fire.

36
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,625
[SHUN] I thought your royal
hide was impervious to cold.

37
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:21,833
[EMILIO]
Shut up.

38
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,083
[ALICIA]
Scoot over, boys.

39
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,291
We want some of that, too.

40
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,416
[SHUN]
Fine, fine.

41
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,875
What're you doing here, Mischa?

42
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,458
I thought you were basically
glued to Demetrio's side.

43
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,583
You must be tired.

44
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,416
Children usually
go to bed early, right?

45
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,666
I am not a child.

46
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,208
I hate to break it to ya, but...

47
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,833
[COMRADE 9A] It's gonna be
a hell of a morale boost

48
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,375
when the others
find out you're here.

49
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,750
From the sound of it, things
are starting to come together.

50
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,000
Recruitment in the north
is going well too.

51
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,958
We've been able to gather
more troops than anticipated.

52
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,666
[DEMETRIO]
Really? That's great.

53
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,916
Good work!

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,750
You've done some amazing
work yourself, Demetrio.

55
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,666
I can't believe you arranged
an alliance with the Zoozians!

56
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,958
I couldn't have done it
without my comrades' help.

57
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,875
[LOUISE] You could've done
it without scaring us all

58
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,125
half to death.

59
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,000
Just thinking about it
makes my stomach hurt.

60
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,125
I agree.

61
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,333
So, what's our next
step going to be?

62
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,375
Our people are ready
whenever you give the word.

63
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,833
We don't want to rush things.

64
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,166
First order of business
is to start negotiations

65
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:09,958
with the king.

66
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:10,958
[COMRADE 9A]
Right.

67
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,458
Considering the
size of our force,

68
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,583
Delzaine might prefer to bargain
than risk a costly fight.

69
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,250
Well, they seem
pretty confident.

70
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,041
Who knows, maybe this
whole thing can be settled

71
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,625
without anyone else
having to die.

72
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,000
[EMILIO] At least one man
still has to die.

73
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:26,250
There's no point negotiating
with someone who won't listen.

74
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,166
What are you saying?

75
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,458
Our only hope of success
is Delzaine's death.

76
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,333
[ALICIA]
Should I go?

77
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,750
[SHUN]
Leave him.

78
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,208
How long's it gonna take
to get to the other side?

79
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,625
There's no way of knowing.

80
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:53,875
What, you can't even guess?

81
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,375
Weather on the mountain
is very unpredictable.

82
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,208
If a blizzard hits, we'll have
no choice but to wait it out.

83
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,541
Seriously?

84
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,250
[DEMETRIO] Keep moving
or we'll leave you behind.

85
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,666
Okay. I'm going already.

86
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,666
[ALICIA]
Shun!

87
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,500
What's up?

88
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,541
Uh...

89
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,750
I want to talk to you
about last night.

90
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,958
[SHUN]
Oh. You mean Emilio?

91
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,666
[ALICIA]
I'm worried about him.

92
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,625
Do you really think
he'll try to kill Delzaine

93
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,083
when we get to Babylon?

94
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,666
I don't know, but I'm sure
hoping he changes his mind.

95
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,583
Especially since I
promised I'd help him.

96
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,958
Same here. He's so secretive.

97
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:29,375
I know he doesn't get along
with his father, but why?

98
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,416
[SHUN] I don't know all the
specifics, but he's serious.

99
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,791
He really, truly
wants to kill the guy.

100
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,250
It's like he's obsessed.

101
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,166
He seems to think killing
Delzaine is the only purpose

102
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,250
his life has anymore.

103
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,958
Doesn't he see
that he's lucky?

104
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,250
What do you mean lucky?

105
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,791
[ALICIA] I don't have
a single person left

106
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,500
who I can call my family.

107
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,833
[FALARION squeaks]

108
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,250
But it's different for him.

109
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,583
He could try to make
things better with Delzaine.

110
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,250
This way'll be
worse for everyone.

111
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,750
Yeah, I know.

112
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,625
[ELJUIA] If you don't want to
freeze to death, hurry up!

113
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,000
What's he talking about?

114
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,583
[DEMETRIO]
Time to make camp.

115
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,250
Storm's on its way.

116
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,166
Is this blizzard
ever gonna end?

117
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,041
I'm sick of waiting here.

118
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,833
[EMILIO] Damn it. We're so
close to Delzaine, too.

119
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,958
[SHUN] So, you said you want
to avenge your father, right?

120
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,583
What does that mean?

121
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,208
[EMILIO]
That's none of your business.

122
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,041
Come on, don't be like that.

123
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,625
I'm helping you, remember?

124
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,541
I think that entitles me to a
little bit of background info.

125
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,041
Shun.

126
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,625
[SHUN] It's not like you've
got a whole lot else to do.

127
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,083
Just tell me.

128
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:50,500
He raised me, but Delzaine
isn't my real father.

129
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:55,541
When I was a little boy,
I wanted to be just like him.

130
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,166
I thought he was so
strong and so brave.

131
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,791
[SHUN] What happened?
Why do you hate him now?

132
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:06,166
I found out he killed my father
so he could seize the throne.

133
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,125
I was a fool.

134
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,125
Idolizing him without ever
suspecting what he was.

135
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,500
[SHUN] That explains why
you don't trust anyone.

136
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,375
I guess I can't blame you.

137
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,958
It must've been lonely in the
castle after you found that out.

138
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,291
[EMILIO]
At first I had Pascal.

139
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,291
I felt like he was the
only person I could trust.

140
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,833
But Delzaine banished
him from the castle,

141
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,291
and I was alone again.

142
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,416
[SHUN] Does Pascal know about
your plans for revenge?

143
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,083
[EMILIO]
He doesn't approve.

144
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,583
Hence the fight you got into.

145
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,916
[EMILIO]
Shun. What would you do?

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,666
Would you forgive the man
who murdered your father?

147
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,291
[SHUN] I would probably feel
the same way you do.

148
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,000
And I'd want to make
whoever was responsible pay.

149
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,458
[EMILIO]
You see?

150
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,416
But there's still my mother.

151
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,208
I don't think I could bring
myself to hurt her like that.

152
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,916
And what about you?

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,083
You've got Pascal and Alicia.

154
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,375
And y'know, I don't
think your real dad

155
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,000
would want you to do it either.

156
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,125
He would.

157
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,708
Why wouldn't he? It's for him.

158
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,583
I'm doing this to avenge him.

159
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,041
[SHUN] You think there's
a parent out there

160
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,166
who wants to see his kid
become a murderer?

161
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,750
'Cause I sure don't.

162
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:26,333
Miss you, Mom.
I'll be home soon.

163
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,125
[EMILIO]
Father, I--

164
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,708
[EMILIO] His face...
Why can't I see his face?

165
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,583
[SHUN laughs]
Woo! Awesome!

166
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,166
Look at this snow!

167
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,958
[DEMETRIO] That blizzard sure
dumped a bunch of it on us.

168
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,208
[SHUN] Aw, man!
I wish I could go boarding!

169
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,375
[ALICIA]
What's that?

170
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,958
[SHUN]
Snowboarding!

171
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,000
You hitch yourself to a board
and go sliding across the snow.

172
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,250
Yeah? That sounds like fun!

173
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,541
[SHUN] I'm actually
pretty good at it, too.

174
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,041
Snow like this is perfect.

175
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:07,625
If I had my board with me,
I would tear this mountain up!

176
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,625
[SHUN laughing]

177
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:10,500
Children.

178
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,833
[LOUISE]
Stop wasting energy.

179
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,125
We've got a lot of hiking ahead.

180
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,833
I'll be fine. Don't worry.

181
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,500
[SHUN]
What the hell is that?

182
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,416
Looks like a dragon
footprint to me.

183
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,375
A dragon?

184
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,958
Yeah.

185
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,833
There used to be dragon nests
all over the Canis mountains.

186
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,166
They were everywhere.

187
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,791
But thanks to
overenthusiastic dragon hunters,

188
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,875
they're almost extinct now.

189
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,583
[FELIX] Seems there's
one nearby, though.

190
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,416
[SHUN]
What? Wait, For real?

191
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,416
Shouldn't we all start
running about now?

192
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,041
[LOUISE] After everything
we've been through,

193
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,666
this is what's
gonna scare you off?

194
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,166
I mean, if you think about it,

195
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,375
you've been traveling with a
mini dragon this whole time.

196
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,625
Huh? What do you mean?

197
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,208
You think Falarion could
be related to dragons?

198
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,958
[FALARION squeaks]

199
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,041
Maybe you'll make some
friends while we're here.

200
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,916
Alicia's got more
guts than Shun,

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,791
but that's no big surprise, huh?

202
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,041
[SHUN] Hey!
I'm scared for good reason.

203
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,541
Dragons breathe fire
and eat people.

204
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,791
We'll never beat one
unless we're max level!

205
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,333
Oh, so dragons on
the surface breathe fire?

206
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,958
Well, not exactly.

207
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,416
Up there, dragons are
just fantasy creatures.

208
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,541
I mean, I've never seen one
outside of video games

209
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,500
or movies.

210
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,250
Video games. Movies.

211
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,875
These are places where
your surface dragons live?

212
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,375
That's not what I meant.

213
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,166
The dragons we have in
Endora don't breathe fire.

214
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,333
We'll be fine.

215
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,125
[ELJUIA yelling]

216
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,291
[SHUN]
Eljuia? Eljuia!

217
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,750
[FALARION squeaks]

218
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:31,833
What's the matter?

219
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,291
[squeaking]

220
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,833
[JOSEPH] It's always
so dark in the archives.

221
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,833
But for a scientist,
darkness represents

222
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,333
the mysterious unknown,
and banishing the darkness

223
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:50,000
guides us to new
revelations and frontiers!

224
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,791
With this lantern,
I will shed light

225
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,708
on the darkest
secrets of the world!

226
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:54,708
[PASCAL]
Huh?

227
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,833
[JOSEPH screams]

228
00:10:56,916 --> 00:11:00,333
[whimpering]

229
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,208
The light you're wearing...

230
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,875
That looks like a variable
plasma energy lamp!

231
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,666
Are you who I think you are?

232
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,500
Sorry to bother you;
don't mind me.

233
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,833
Whoa!

234
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,375
[PASCAL] I think your name
was Joseph, wasn't it?

235
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,458
Yes!

236
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,541
[PASCAL]
That lantern of yours...

237
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,791
You make it yourself?

238
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,125
[JOSEPH]
I did!

239
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,291
Building that sort of
thing is a hobby of mine.

240
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,083
It's just a toy compared
to your lamp, though!

241
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,500
No, don't belittle
your accomplishment.

242
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,958
To make a voltaic electrode lamp
at your age is impressive.

243
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,166
[JOSEPH]
I can hardly believe it!

244
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,416
The great Pascal
is praising my work!

245
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,416
You're the whole reason
I became a scientist!

246
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,125
Emulating you is what
drives all my research!

247
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,083
Uh... That's very
nice, young man.

248
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,000
But could you stop
shaking the ladder?

249
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,375
[JOSEPH]
I'm sorry!

250
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,916
You know...

251
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,500
I think your most impressive
work was that ingenious trick

252
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,750
with the Babel design.

253
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,750
It reminded me that
in the right hands,

254
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,583
science can also be an art!

255
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,375
So you know about that, do you?

256
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,083
Were you the one who
figured it out, then?

257
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,208
[JOSEPH]
Yes!

258
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,291
I was so proud to
have discovered it,

259
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,916
I could barely contain
my excitement

260
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,291
when I told the chief about it.

261
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,458
And he was so impressed
with the final design

262
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,291
he insisted on accompanying
the king to Babylon himself.

263
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,041
[PASCAL] When you're the
one who fixed the problem?

264
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,541
[JOSEPH]
I don't mind.

265
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,666
Just getting to spend so many
hours studying the design

266
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,291
was more than I
had ever hoped for!

267
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,000
If I ever see
that chief of yours,

268
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,500
I'm going to thank him
for leaving you behind.

269
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,583
[JOSEPH]
Huh?

270
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,083
[ELJUIA] I need to find
a way back to the others

271
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,625
as quickly as I can.

272
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,000
But I don't think it'll be easy.

How does your little guy know
what direction we should go?

It's a talent of his.

He can track the Warp Relics
inside of people.

279
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,083
That's how we found
Emilio and Shun

00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,666
You okay?

317
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,291
My... dad...

318
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,833
[ALICIA'S FATHER]
Alicia. I've missed you.

319
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,041
So it's you?

320
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,791
It really is you, Father?

321
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,041
[ALICIA'S FATHER]
Yes.

322
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,375
I always hoped I would
speak with you again.

323
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,916
[ALICIA] But why like this,
through Falarion?

324
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,333
Where are you?

325
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,083
[ALICIA'S FATHER]
I no longer have an Endra form.

326
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,875
I'm a spirit now.

327
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,333
What happened?

328
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,375
[ALICIA'S FATHER]
I will tell you everything.

329
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,291
How I came to be
as you see me now...

330
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,500
How I found myself trapped
within a Warp Relic.

331
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,958
[ALICIA'S FATHER] Years ago,
I made my living as a hunter.

332
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,125
I loved adventure
and the thrill of danger.

333
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,375
I willingly risked my
life to hone my skills.

334
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,125
Then one day I met my match.

335
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:29,708
The monster had me cornered,
and certain death loomed.

336
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,708
I accepted that
the end had come,

337
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,583
but in that moment,
my Warp Relic evolved,

338
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,833
and I defeated the monster.

339
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,833
That encounter reminded
me of an old legend.

340
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:43,416
That Warp Relics are influenced
by their wielder's spirit,

341
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,625
evolving as a person's passion
and determination increase.

342
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,625
Bent on becoming more powerful,

343
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:53,208
I became obsessed with
evolving my Warp Relic.

344
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,541
When it evolved twice
and no more,

345
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,791
I assumed that was
the limit of its power

346
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,958
and I had realized
its full potential.

347
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,333
If I had known then
that my obsession

348
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,791
would ultimately be my undoing,

349
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:09,458
perhaps things would
have turned out differently.

350
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,250
Time passed and I met my wife.

351
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,125
We married, and you
were born, Alicia.

352
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,333
This doesn't make sense.

353
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,708
The father I knew never
hunted any monsters.

354
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,333
[ALICIA'S FATHER]
Because I realized my family

355
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,041
was more important
than a Warp Relic.

356
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:27,166
I gave up being a hunter
and became a carpenter.

357
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,250
But if family was
so important to you,

358
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,333
then why did you
disappear after Mom died?

359
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,458
I was only ten years old.
I needed you!

360
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,916
[ALICIA'S FATHER] Your mother
was killed by bandits.

361
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,500
I thought it was an accident!

362
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,833
[ALICIA'S FATHER]
No.

363
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,708
Angry at myself for
not protecting her,

364
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,875
and consumed by revenge,

365
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:48,166
I left my young daughter
and searched for the bandits.

366
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,750
I found them,
and killed them all.

367
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,416
When the last one was dead,

368
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,375
my Warp Relic evolved
without warning.

369
00:17:56,458 --> 00:18:00,333
It pulled me in,
and I was trapped within it.

370
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,541
Impossible...

371
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,833
How could something
like that even happen?

372
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,416
Warp Relics are connected
to their users' emotions.

373
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,041
[ALICIA'S FATHER]
Indeed.

374
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,208
My obsessions with
power and revenge

375
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,291
led to my downfall when
the relentless hatred I felt

376
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,500
triggered its final evolution.

377
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,708
And that's how I became
a living Warp Relic.

378
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,083
What does that mean, exactly?

379
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,916
[ALICIA'S FATHER] A living
Warp Relic belongs to no one.

380
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,791
It is an independent entity that
possesses a will of its own.

381
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,500
Except that Falarion
comes with me wherever I go.

382
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,416
[ALICIA'S FATHER]
Because whatever else I am,

383
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
I'm still your father.

384
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:38,708
My spirit is always sleeping,
lying dormant inside Falarion.

385
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,916
It is only when you are in
grave danger that I can awake

386
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,541
and come to your aid.

387
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,166
[SHUN] Can all living Warp
Relics do what you can?

388
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,125
Make a place like this, I mean?

389
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:51,166
[ALICIA'S FATHER] No, it is
not normal for any Warp Relic

390
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,666
to have this power.

391
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,458
But my situation is
something of an anomaly,

392
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:58,041
and so I have abilities
beyond what is usual.

393
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,916
Because of our connection?
Because I'm your daughter?

394
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,708
[ALICIA'S FATHER]
I believe so.

395
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:07,541
Alicia. I am so sorry for
leaving you when you were young.

396
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:11,458
But remember,
I am always by your side.

397
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,833
I want you to know that.

398
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,583
[ALICIA sniffles]

399
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,833
This means... I've
never been alone, have I?

400
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,291
[ALICIA'S FATHER]
No, and you never will be.

401
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,750
I'll watch over you forever.

402
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,875
So keep smiling, Alicia.

403
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,083
Yes. I will.

404
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,458
I don't think I fully
understood all that.

405
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,416
I don't either.

406
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,541
[DEMETRIO]
Hey! Snap out of it!

407
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,083
What was that about?

408
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,250
What happened?

409
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,333
[SHUN]
Well, that's a good question.

410
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,916
Sorry, but we don't
really know either.

411
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,333
[ELJUIA] There you are.
Is everyone okay?

412
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,625
Are we okay?

413
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,125
Hey! Behind you!

414
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,833
Don't worry. It's all right.

415
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,000
They don't mean us any harm,

416
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,250
though this one
seems to be injured.

417
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,750
We stumbled upon a nest
belonging to a dragon family.

418
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:08,333
My fath--Um...
I mean, Falarion told me so.

419
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,708
[FALARION squeaks]

420
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,041
The parents were only trying
to protect their child.

421
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,583
Just like any creature would.

422
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,708
[SHUN] They probably attacked
us thinking we were a group

423
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,500
of dragon hunters.

424
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,416
How could Falarion tell you?

425
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,958
I've never heard him
say a single word.

426
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,375
Sorry, but that's a secret.

427
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,166
[LOUISE] I think the
weather's going to hold.

428
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,750
[DEMETRIO] Good! Let's try to
reach the summit before sunset.

429
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,250
I don't know if
that's gonna happen.

430
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,250
We've still got a whole lot
of ground to cover.

431
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,833
[growling noise]

432
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,541
[FALARION squeaks]

433
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,666
Now this is the way to travel!

434
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,208
Dragons are very fast.

435
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,000
It looks like our journey
just got a lot shorter.

436
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,125
Sweet! Just like a movie!
