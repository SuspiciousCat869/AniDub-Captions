1
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:13,583
[LOUISE] Well, it
certainly has... character.

2
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,500
[SHUN] We're sailing
in this hunk of junk?

3
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,583
It'll sink as soon
as someone touches it!

4
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,375
Sorry.

5
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,000
The ship's been out of
commission a few months now,

6
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,791
but the port inspector would
notice if I gave you a new one.

7
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,291
Don't worry about it.
You made the right call.

8
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,375
The last thing we need is
any troops from the city

9
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,833
coming after us.

10
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,791
I'm always happy to lend
a hand to the Ignauts.

11
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,083
Did as much as I could
to patch her up last night.

12
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,708
She'll get you
where you need to go.

13
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,666
That much I can promise you.

14
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,875
[DEMETRIO]
You have my thanks.

15
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:45,000
All right! Everyone aboard!

16
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,208
No point in gettin' anxious yet!

17
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,041
If we sink,
it'll be way out at sea!

18
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,750
[SHUN] It's gotta be
bad luck to say that!

19
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,666
[ALICIA] Hurry up!
Boat's not gettin' any younger!

20
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,375
[SHUN]
There's a comforting thought.

21
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,166
And now to finish it.

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,708
That's enough, you two!

23
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,500
Come on, Felix,
you of all people

24
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,375
should know better than to
summon your Warp Relic

25
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,166
in the middle of
a sparring match.

26
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,833
So next time I'll just
let her slit my throat?

27
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,916
You know, I gotta say,

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,083
going against a fighter like
Felix is pretty impressive

29
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,708
for someone as young as you.

30
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,916
I could destroy him with ease.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,833
I don't understand how
they can even walk around

32
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,791
on this rickety old salvage.

33
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:18,750
[SHUN gags]

34
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:19,916
It's not hard.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,958
Unless of course you're seasick.

36
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,375
[FALARION squeaks]

37
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,958
Just gimme a break, will ya?

38
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:28,125
I've never been on a real ship
before, let alone one like this.

39
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,958
It feels like every time
we hit a wave,

40
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,791
I'm gonna get knocked
right out of this thing.

41
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,833
[ELJUIA]
You look a bit ill, Shun.

42
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,833
If you're feeling seasick,
then you should try eating

43
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,416
some of these.

44
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,541
Sure.

45
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,541
[SHUN coughing]

46
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,750
What the hell?

47
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,333
It's one of those cures
that's almost worse

48
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:48,916
than the ailment, am I right?

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,083
I honestly thought
you'd decided to kill me.

50
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,250
But you were right.
I feel way better now.

51
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,250
[ELJUIA]
I'm pleased to hear it.

52
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,166
Hey, have either
of you seen Emilio?

53
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,291
No. Now that you mention it,
I haven't seen him

54
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,750
since we set sail.

55
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,083
Whoa, there. If you
need to hurl, go up top.

56
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,500
I'm perfectly fine.

57
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,375
Don't lump me
together with Shun.

58
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,000
Just cause he can't keep
his food in, doesn't--

59
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,208
[EMILIO groans]

60
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,625
[DEMETRIO laughs]

61
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,250
I came here to ask
if you're serious

62
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,833
about taming the Zoozians.

63
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,833
Well, I wouldn't
use the word "tame."

64
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:35,125
But yes, I do plan
to seek their help.

65
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,500
You seem displeased.

66
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,083
Of course I'm displeased!

67
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,583
You shouldn't need
reminding about how many

68
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,250
of our allies they killed!

69
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:45,708
I won't blame an entire race
for the actions of a few.

70
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,125
In serving Delzaine,
the Truculent have severed

71
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:51,375
all ties to their people.

72
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,041
These waters will
only get rougher.

73
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,125
The Zoozians didn't
settle here by choice.

74
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,958
They were shipped off
with the intention

75
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,916
that they never make it back.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,708
It's a natural prison
of rock and current.

77
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,416
How is this old wreck supposed
to help us get through that?

78
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,125
I did say this
would be a rough ride,

79
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,000
especially for a spoiled priss.

80
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,291

Swear you'll never
call me Priss again.

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,166
What? No way, dude.

85
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,333
That name fits you
like a friggin' glove.

86
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,041
[SHUN]
Ah! Okay, fine, whatever!

87
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,125
You're not a priss!
You're a total badass!

88
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,375
Just let me up!

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,750
Will you two ever stop fighting?

91
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,666
[SHUN, EMILIO]
Hmph!

92

--[ALICIA yelling]
--[FALARION squeaking]

93
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,166
It's kinda choppy out here.

94
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,833
It certainly is.

95
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,375
One of the boards
in the forward keel

96
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,375
got busted somehow,
so we need to patch it

97
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,708
or we're gonna sink.

98
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,083
[ELJUIA] There's a chance
I can hold her together

with my Warp Relic.

really worth all this?

We didn't die, did we? Say no.

102
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,458
Don't even think of
asking me to carry you.

103
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,583
Yeah, as if you could.

104

You look even worse than I feel.

Stop talking. Your voice
makes my head throb.

Everyone's safe. Don't worry.

109
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,916
From the looks of things,
she's made her last voyage.

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,750
Well then, we'd better
secure that alliance

111

with the Zoozians.

112
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,166
It's our best hope for a ship,

113

and our only chance
of staying free and alive.

Sad but true.

115

It's hardly the first
time we've been

on the verge of destruction.

Well, we may be walking
on a bit of tightrope,

pointing out the way.

that could keep those guys down.

We appreciate
the warm reception.

You landed on the
wrong Island, Endras.

We should try to strike first!

I forbid it, Mischa.

129
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,000
We went through
a lot to get here.

130
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,375
That wasn't because we
have a shortage of enemies.

131
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,458
So you must be the chief
of the Zoozians here.

We need to talk.

planning to do with us?

Listen, I know you're
only doing this

137
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,416
to protect yourselves,
but if you'd hear us out, I--

138
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,958
Shut your mouth.

139
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,416
We'd have bound you with them
if you weren't part Zoozian.

Don't make me
regret that choice.

141
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,875
These Endras are
trespassers on our lands,

142
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,625
and that's how
they'll be treated.

Hey...

144
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,041
So is it just me, or do we
seem completely screwed here?

145
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,583
Astute observation.

146
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,916
Endras and Zoozians have
been at odds for generations.

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,375
Of course this is
how they greet us.

148
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,250
What does Demetrio
think he's doing here?

149
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,250
The usual for Endras
who end up here

150
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,250
is to cower at my feet and beg.

151
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,375
I find it refreshing
you've opted instead

152
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,041
to give a stoic glare
and a silent tongue.

153
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,541
Isolated though we are,
some rumors do reach us.

154
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,666
If what we've heard is true,
you're the Ignauts.

155
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,166
A band of rebels led by the
charismatic Endra, Demetrio.

156
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,458
I'm flattered to hear
that you remembered my name.

157
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,041
It's quite the honor.

158
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,916
I've no use for
your pleasantries.

320
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,583
[DEMETRIO]
By all means. I'm listening.

321
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,166
When you explained your
need for our assistance,

322
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,291
you mentioned our
strength in particular.

323
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,333
Am I to assume you'd like us
to fight the king's army?

324
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,750
No.

325
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,041
If my plan's successful,
there'll be no need to fight.

326
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,791
I want this
revolution to succeed

327
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,791
without any further
loss of life.

328
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,541
That sounds naïve to me.

329
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,291
It's not a bad idea though.

330
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,625
We'll send a message.

331
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,500
Proof of our strength
and resolve.

332
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,250
We have to show
this king with numbers

333
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,041
that his people want better.

334
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,291
So he'll refuse to
negotiate unless he believes

335
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,875
you stand on equal ground.

336
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,125
And you want us with you,
because the stronger you look,

337
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,416
the more likely he'll
be to hear your terms.

338
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,916
Yeah.

339
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,916
[GRADIDO]
One more thing.

340
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,250
You said you wanted to depose
the king but not to replace him.

341
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,750
What did you mean by that?

342
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,916
I meant exactly what I said.

343
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,458
Society will collapse if there's
no one on top to direct it.

344
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,166
You can't want to end
all civilization.

345
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,583
I don't.

346
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,416
There'll have to be a
new king, I realize that.

347
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
So why not take
the job yourself?

348
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,708
Thing is, if I did become King,

349
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,500
then regardless of what
I actually intended to do,

350
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,958
people would suspect I revolted
to take power for myself.

351
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,625
We can't build a country
off of a foundation of doubt.

352
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,958
When the time comes,
we'll choose a king.

353
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,375
One who treats all
their subjects as equals

354
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,750
despite their species.

355
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,250
A king who judges people
only for their deeds.

356
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,875
Have you met someone like that?

357
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,708
No, I haven't.

358
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,375
Hey! I was wonderin'
where ya went off to.

359
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,625
And now you know.

360
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,166
[SHUN]
Didja hear?

361
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,583
It looks like the Zoozians are
gonna help us out after all!

362
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,666
I wonder what Demetrio
said to change their minds.

363
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,208
Yeah.

364
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,375
Geez, dude, try not
to get so excited.

365
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,916
It's not like we just
took a huge step towards

366
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,708
bringing down Delzaine
or something.

367
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,625
You look all pensive.
What're you thinkin' about?

368
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,041
[EMILIO]
Look.

369
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:40,125
Before all this began,
I never really left the castle.

370
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,000
Must've been pretty
sheltered living there.

371
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,666
Yes, that's true.

372
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,500
I realize now how
ignorant I was.

373
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,708
Those hungry kids in Ametius...

374
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,125
The Zoozians who
were sent here...

375
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,750
I just now realized that
back when Demetrio asked me

376
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,583
what I would do
once the king was dead,

377
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,791
people like them
didn't even exist to me.

378
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah.

379
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,416
The weird thing is,
it wasn't that long ago.

380
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,125
[EMILIO] Back then I thought
that nothing else could matter.

381
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,291
I would take vengeance
for my father.

382
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,958
And then, that would be the end.

383
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,500
It's not, though.

384
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,833
All those lives will go on.

385
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,166
Maybe I can stop Delzaine,

386
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,208
but the kingdom
will still be there,

387
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,291
as will the lives
that depend on it.

388
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,041
I wanted to ask you...

389
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,208
Was your life really so
different on the surface

390
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,833
from how it is down here?

391
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,791
[SHUN]
Well, yeah. It was.

392
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,583
[EMILIO] Could you tell me what
it was like to live up there?

393
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,250
What kind of life would
an average person have?

394
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,958
What the heck's
gotten into you, man?

395
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,583
You never asked me to tell
you about the surface before.

396
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,125
Never thought to.

397
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,125
So are you gonna answer?

398
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,708
[SHUN]
Well, it's not perfect.

399
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,458
But compared to here,
I guess life is kind of easy.

400
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,625
Things are more
convenient, for sure.

401
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,000
We have some pretty
crazy technology.

402
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,083
[EMILIO]
Really, now?

403
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,125
[SHUN]
Yeah. Like, uh...

404
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,958
You know all those weird
gadgets Pascal likes to make?

405
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,791
Literally everybody I
know's got stuff like that.

406
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:03,125
[EMILIO] Everyone up there
has inventions like Pascal's?

407
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,666
The surface sounds
kind of dangerous now.

408
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,416
Stuff like jets
and flamethrowers

409
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,875
are a bit harder to come by.

410
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,875
But people do have them.

411
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,500
Most of us have
plenty to eat.

412
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,791
Discrimination's illegal,
and there's no war,

413
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,458
least not in my country.

414
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,833
It almost sounds like a utopia.

415
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,958
Yeah. I guess it does.

416
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:25,125
Hm? Is something wrong?

417
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,250
No, I'm good.

418
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,291
Don't worry. It was nothing.

419
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,708
It would appear they
managed to convince Gradido

420
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,375
to join them somehow.

421
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,833
[VESTULSE grunts]

422
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:42,791
What a nuisance!

423
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,375
Really?

424
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,291
As much as he hates Endras, I'm
surprised they could sway him.

425
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,750
Guess our job is
that much harder now.

426
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,791
[GUIDORO]
There's something else, too.

427
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,291
It's rather interesting.

428
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,625
So spit it out.

429
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,125
That boy who wounded you
with the prince's help...

430
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,000
It seems he's from the surface.

431
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,833
Huh?! That cocky little freak?

432
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,125
[growls]

433
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,333
So what now?

434
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,166
Should we report to Delzaine?

435
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,291
No. We'll continue as planned.

436
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:47,041
[FELIX] Next episode,
"Father and Child."
