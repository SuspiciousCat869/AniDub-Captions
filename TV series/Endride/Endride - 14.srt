1
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:16,291
[ELJUIA]
Gotten rather quiet, hasn't it?

2
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:19,833
That's because the Royal Guard
took off for the capital.

3
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,500
Things may be calm enough here,

4
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:24,375
but the rest of Endora's
about to be under duress.

5
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,375
[ELJUIA]
Yes, you're right.

6
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:30,375
I'm afraid that the chaos and
bloodshed has begun already.

7
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,791
[GRADIDO] Delzaine's death
changes everything.

8
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,708
The Ignauts have
made us promises,

9
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:39,166
but the Endras sitting
in those ships have not.

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,291
We need reports back
from every region.

11
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,250
[COMRADE 14A]
I understand, sir.

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,500
The time's come to show
the people what we're worth.

13
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:50,833
[ELJUIA]
It's frustrating.

14
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:53,041
Everyone needs our
help, but we can't leave

15
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,458
until Pascal's finished
his investigation.

16
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:58,291
No. But we can make sure
we're prepared to head out

17
00:00:58,375 --> 00:00:59,833
as soon as he finishes.

18
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:03,875
And by the way, how's Emilio?
Any change?

19
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,625
[ELJUIA]
No, not yet.

20
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,625
[DEMETRIO]
Guess that's to be expected.

21
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,916
Hey, Pascal?

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,166
This might sound strange,
but I'm seeing no problems.

23
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,625
Yeah, same thing over here.

24
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,208
As far as I can tell,

25
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:59,333
Babel operated exactly
as it was intended to.

26
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,958
But from Shun's description
of the Zoozian's screams,

27
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:05,041
I highly doubt he made
it to the surface.

28
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,875
Well, if everything is
working fine on our end,

29
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,541
then we have to assume that
the problem is on theirs.

30
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,083
[JOSEPH] I see.
You mean on the surface?

31
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:16,333
Any theories as to what exactly
could've gone wrong up there?

32
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,958
There's no way to be sure
without seeing for myself, but,

33
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,041
if the simplest theory is
typically the right one,

34
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,958
then the path was probably
clogged somehow.

35
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:29,458
Ah! We just keep running into
conundrum after conundrum!

36
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,833
But that's exactly what makes
scientific research worthwhile!

37
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,333
[laughs]

38
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:37,083
[ALICIA] It's starting to feel
like we have two Pascal's.

39
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,708
[PASCAL]
Hey there, Alicia.

40
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,333
I figured you two
might need a break,

41
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,125
so I brought you a little food.

42
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,208
[PASCAL] 'Preciate it.
Don't mind if I do.

43
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,708
Come on, Joseph!
Aren't you hungry?

44
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,958
[FALARION squeals]

45
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,083
Each question leads to an answer
that'll take us one step further

46
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,958
down the path of truth!

47
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,416
--He still hasn't noticed.
--[JOSEPH] No, of enlightenment!

48
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,333
[ALICIA]
Wait a second.

49
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,250
If the path up to
the surface is blocked,

50
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,250
then shouldn't you be happy?

51
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,708
I mean, you never wanted
contact with the surface,

52
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,041
you thought it would
be dangerous, right?

53
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,458
And I feel the same now.

54
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:18,625
Thing is, I still want to help
Shun get to the surface.

55
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,333
[ALICIA]
Gotcha.

56
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,083
[FALARION chirps]

57
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,833
[PASCAL]
The king is dead.

58
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:30,416
And a plethora of mysteries
have died with him, unsolved.

59
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,791
I still don't know what he was
trying to accomplish here.

60
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,916
Hey, Pascal?

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,208
[PASCAL]
Mm? What's up?

62
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,458
Well, you know how Emilio's
been feeling down?

63
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,958
[PASCAL]
Yeah?

64
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:43,041
[ALICIA] Do you think there's
anything I can do to help?

65
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,916
[PASCAL]
I've wondered the same.

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,125
People questions
aren't my specialty.

67
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:51,333
I'd like to help him
as much as you, but...

68
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,333
[ALICIA exhales]

69
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,166
[SHUN]
Hello!

70
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,333
[gasps] Hey! Whatcha doin'?

71
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,875
Nothin', yunno,

72
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,208
just thought I'd check on how
the investigation was going.

73
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,458
[PASCAL sighs]

74
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:05,291
[SHUN]
Uh. Oh, wow.

75
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,166
[PASCAL] We don't have
the time or resources

76
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,083
to investigate this any further.

77
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,708
Sorry for letting
you down, Shun.

78
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:15,458
I can only imagine how
you must feel right now.

79
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,041
Hey, don't gimme that.

80
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,208
It's not like this means I
can never make it back home.

81
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,750
You and your little lab
friend... Uh, Johnny?

82
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,333
Whatever, you're geniuses.

83
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,125
I'm sure you'll figure out how
to make Babel work eventually.

84
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,791
And even if it turns out you
can't: this is a big world.

85
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm sure I'll find
another way somewhere.

86
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,125
Another way out?

87
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,750
Yeah, but anyway, before
I jump the gun on that stuff,

88
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,458
I've gotta go cheer
up Sir Mopes-A-Lot.

89
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,541
He should know the difference

90
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,708
between mourning
and blaming himself.

91
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:44,958
[ALICIA]
Heh.

92
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,708
Emilio's found himself
some fine friends.

93
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,291
[explosion]

94
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,958
[JOSEPH]
Aww, no, no, no!

95
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,750
That took it over capacity?

96
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,416
Curse this refurbished
ancient tech.

97
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,750
Ahh! Golly gosh darn it!
I'm fine! I've got this.

98
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,083
I can compensate
for the pressure

99
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,541
if I use a larger
volume container...

100
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,833
[PASCAL] You know, Emilio might
just need a small distraction.

101
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,416
Something to take
his mind off things.

102
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,833
Somethin' to distract him.

103
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,166
I've got it!

104
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,416
[DEMETRIO]
Good luck to you.

105
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,750
[COMRADE 14B]
Thanks, sir.

106
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,750
Was that a messenger?
What did he have to say?

107
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:28,250
Oh, just an update
from the provinces.

108
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,041
In the wake of the king's death,

109
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,416
many regions have
fallen into strife.

110
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,166
I came to ask, what do you plan
to do now that it's done?

111
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,666
[DEMETRIO]
What's done?

112
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,875
The king. The whole reason
for your revolution.

113
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:45,166
The only purpose I had.
He's gone now.

114
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,125
You asked as if you knew.

115
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:50,583
You said the king's blood lies
spilt across his throne.

116
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,833
So what will you do now?

117
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,375
The Ignauts' fight
has only just begun.

118
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,625
The king's death gives
us more work to do.

119
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:02,333
Unrest in this country
will only worsen from here.

120
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,375
The royal guard
has lost its head.

121
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,083
We'll see a great
deal of turmoil

122
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:09,708
as lords seek to expand their
holdings, or settle old feuds.

123
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,833
Until this country
is whole once again,

124
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,916
the Ignauts'll still
have a job to do.

125
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,750
[DEMETRIO]
We'll be starting on it

126
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,666
as soon as Pascal
finishes his work here.

127
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,083
You could come. Unless you
plan to stay here forever.

What were you and Demetrio
just talkin' about?

131
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,541
It's none of your business.
Now what do you want from me?

[SHUN] "Want?" I'm just
sick of sittin' around.

muscles just to lose 'em.

134

[SHUN]
Thought we could spar for a bit.

135
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:54,416
You know, if you're feelin'
up for it, I mean.

136
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,625
[EMILIO] Well I'm not. I suggest
you find a tree somewhere.

137
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,000
What's the deal? I asked
nicely and everything.

138
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:04,041
Have you forgotten that you
can't go back to the surface?

By what right are you
acting so damn chipper?

Your dream was ruined!

Well I'm not happy about how
things turned out. That's life.

142
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,583
But I understand that
acting depressed

143
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,583
isn't gonna help me fix it.

144
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,083
That would just make me
useless, like you are.

Huh. If you seriously
think that's impressive,

than I thought you did.

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,083
Then again, perhaps I'm
the real child here.

157
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,125
[DEMETRIO] Our first order of
business is to head to a nearby

158
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:16,250
town. We need to secure some
fresh rations and supplies.

159
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,708
After that--

160
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,708
[MISCHA, FELIX, ELJUIA gasp]

161
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,541
What are you doing here?

162
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,166
[ELJUIA]
Uh. Mischa.

163
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,250
[LOUISE sighs] I've decided
to leave the Ignauts.

164
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,958
But why, Louise?

165
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:35,583
You know why. Because I
betrayed you all for money.

166
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,208
None of you will ever see
me the way you did before,

167
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,500
and you shouldn't have to try.

168
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,000
So, goodbye.

169
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:49,833
[gasps]

170
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,208
[gasps]

171
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,000
[ELJUIA]
Is something wrong?

172
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,458
It's the island Zoozians.

173
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,000
They're asking us
for assistance.

174
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,708
[DEMETRIO]
What's their situation?

175
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,458
Apparently the island's
been besieged

176
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:06,000
by a large number of ships.
But I don't understand why.

177
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,708
That place was generally left
alone by Endras for generations.

178
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,958
[DEMETRIO]
Hm...

179
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,333
[LORD 14A] I've come here
to bring this island

180
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,041
under my protection.

181
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:49,416
I can only imagine the squalor
in which you've all been living.

182
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,041
Rest easy knowing that
you'll soon know safety

183
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,083
and civilization as my slaves.

184
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,333
[laughs]

185
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:59,875
[ZOOZIANS chattering]

186
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,625
[GUY 14A] Can't tell the
difference between lords

187
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:04,958
and bandits these days.

188
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,791
[GUY 14B] Yeah, and there's
no one to stop 'em.

189
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,666
I hear the king died in Babylon.

190
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,333
[GUY 14C]
It's a proper mess all right.

191
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,750
And with Prince Emilio
missing, too.

192
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,583
The entire country's
falling apart.

193
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:17,500
[VICTIM 14A gasping]

194
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,958
Now gimme everything you've got!

195
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,000
[THIEF 14B]
C'mon! No stalling!

196
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:24,458
I don't have a single cent
to give you ruffians!

197
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,875
Please, I have family!

198
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,375
[THIEF 14B]
Shut your mouth.

199
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,833
[VICTIM 14A groans]

200
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,791
[THIEF 14A] Ha! This is for
tryin' to slip it past us!

201
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,666
[THIEF 14B] We're totally
gonna get away with this.

202
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,833
The king's dead, and
the Lord's off fighting,

203
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,958
so who's gonna stop us? [laughs]

204
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,416
[DEMETRIO]
It's falling apart.

205
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,208
No one is strong enough to
hold the country together.

206
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,583
Never occurred to me that
the king was the only thing

207
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,958
stopping people from invading
that Zoozian island.

208
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,958
I wonder how
long they can hold on.

209
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:57,708
At any rate, our work as a
revolutionary army is over.

210
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,375
[DEMETRIO] And our work
as peacemakers begins.

211
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:07,708
We must stop this fighting
before it gets even worse.

212
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:11,750
Thing about the Ignauts is each
of us decided to be here.

213
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,416
Decided to stay.

214
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:19,000
Louise. Nobody's gonna take that
choice from you, so decide.

215
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,916
[LOUISE gasps]

216
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,708
There's something I...

217
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,083
There's something that
I have to take care of.

218
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:28,666
[FELIX]
What? What do you have to go do?

219
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,333
Not "go." I choose to stay

220
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,625
and do whatever I can
to help the cause.

221
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,708
You'll stay?

222
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,791
That's twice you've broken
your word to us.

223
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,875
[LOUISE] Before, I thought
I needed to leave,

224
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,500
to pay for what I've done.

225
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,458
But if the Ignauts still
have work ahead of them,

226
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,458
then I think the best path
towards atoning for my crimes

227
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,625
is through service.

228
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,541
What good is a
traitor's service?!

229
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,125
[LOUISE]
Not much.

230
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:57,000
I don't expect you to trust me
with anything important again.

231
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,875
And I won't ask you to
think of me as a comrade.

232
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,791
I ask only for the chance
to nullify a small part

233
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,291
of the damage I've done.

234
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,333
You think we can
trust her, Demetrio?

235
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:11,750
[DEMETRIO] Do you really
have to ask? Listen here.

236
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,708
There has never been
a time in my life

237
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,583
when I haven't
trusted you, Louise.

238
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:16,333
[gasps]

239
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,833
[MISCHA]
But she's a--

240
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,666
[ELJUIA] She did what she
thought was right at the time,

241
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,000
and has since come
to know her mistake.

242
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,958
And as the message she relayed
from the Zoozians demonstrated,

243
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,500
a person of her
unique background

244
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,500
is far too useful to lose.

245
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,375
Thanks, Eljuia.

246
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,000
What a pushover.

247
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,000
I knew Demetrio would
decide to forgive her.

248
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,250
[MISCHA]
You act as if you know

249
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,625
everything there is to
know about Demetrio.

250
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:39,666
I hate it.

251
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,416
I've known him far
longer than you.

252
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,875
[MISCHA growls] If she has to
stay, then I'll watch her.

253
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,416
If she's up to something,
I'll know instantly.

254
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,791
I'll watch her as well.

255
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,416
You're a copycat.

256
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,333
[FELIX]
No, I'm not.

257
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:51,916
[MISCHA]
Are to.

258
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,541
[FELIX]
Am not.

259
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,541
[MISCHA]
Are to!

00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,000
[DEMETRIO]
It's all out now.

266
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,666
You'll never have to
break your heart

267
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,666
to keep yourself in check again.

268
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,166
Instead, listen to it, and do
whatever it tells you is right.

269
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,250
You can trust that.

[panting]

272
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,708
[EMILIO] So, what the
hell am I doing here?

00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:47,000
Why do I always play
right into his hands?

00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:51,125
I know it's all
pointless, so why?

275
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,416
Will you just leave
me alone already?

276
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,000
How I spend my days
doesn't concern you!

277

Oh, enough of that crap.

278
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,458
It's my concern
as much as yours!

00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,708
We're in this thing together,
and you're stuck in a rut!

280
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,875
I won't leave you behind!

281
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,625
I... see.

Looks like it's my win.

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,041
[SHUN]
That's gonna leave a mark.

[EMILIO]
Here.

290
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,916
I guess I should thank you.

[SHUN]
For what? I didn't letcha win.

292
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,583
[EMILIO] You only came out here
to try and cheer me up.

293
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,000
[SHUN]
Yeah that's kinda true,

294
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:43,041
but I was also feelin'
pretty antsy.

295
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,541
So listen, man.

296
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,333
You need to cut it out with
the perpetual pity party.

297
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,750
I think you should learn
how to let go of the past.

298
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:50,791
Say what?

299
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,041
The past isn't
changeable, ya know?

300
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,291
[EMILIO]
Sure.

301
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,125
But the future is, so
if you think forward,

302
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,166
you could be a little
more positive.

303
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,500
Before Delzaine was killed, all
you thought about was revenge.

304
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:05,750
But now that he's gone, all
you talk about is regret. Why?

305
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,333
It's almost as if you
enjoy being depressed.

306
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,916
You're like the Prince of Gloom.

307
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,291
That won't catch on.

308
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,708
But it's accurate!

309
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,708
You're always off kickin'
dirt in the corner,

310

I guess you're right.

312
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,833
[SHUN] Uh?! No, I was
just talkin' smack.

313
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,666
You're supposed to
snap back, remember?

314
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,666
We've covered this!
Say somethin' real mean.

315
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,541
Cut deep, I'm ready. Come at me.

316
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,833
You were only telling
me the truth.

317
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,583
I've become far too
obsessed with the past.

318
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,166
What? You mean that?

319
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:38,666
[EMILIO] However, I'm not like
you. You still have your goal.

320
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,000
I have nothing. No purpose.

321
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,083
I wouldn't worry, just do
what you can. You'll be fine.

322
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,666
Focus on the future
you'd like to see,

323
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,458
and help whoever you
can along the way.

324
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,000
You make it sound
rather simple.

325
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:03,208
That's it. I understand now.

326
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,666
Thank you.

327
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,958
[SHUN]
Uh...

328
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,916
[ELJUIA]
If we head straight for Gradido,

329
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,916
we'll pass through settlements
both here and here.

330
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,333
And both of those settlements
happen to be under siege

331
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:15,666
the same as he is.

332
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,375
[footsteps]

333
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:16,833
[EMILIO]
Demetrio.

334
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,000
[ALL gasp]

335
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,791
We were wonderin' where
you guys had gone.

336
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,333
[DEMETRIO]
Hey. What's up?

337
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,666
I've come to ask a favor.

338
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,666
It's good to see that you've
perked up a little bit.

339
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,791
That have to do with this favor?

340
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,875
It does. I want to
join the Ignauts.

341
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,541
[ELJUIA gasping]

342
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:43,083
Any particular reason why
you're saying this now?

343
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,833
Between leaving the capital
and arriving in Babylon,

344
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,458
I've seen more than
I could've imagined.

345
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:52,958
The poverty of the people.
The cruelty of privilege.

346
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:56,625
The way our world treats
those of ill-fated birth.

347
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,791
Before, I'd hoped to use you.

348
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:02,000
I saw your group as a tool
for obtaining revenge.

349
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:06,500
I see more now. See that you
fight for something worthwhile.

350
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,708
Let me help. I beg you.

351
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,166
[DEMETRIO] I'll give you
a few points for passion,

352
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,750
but I've got no idea
what you're asking for.

353
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,791
You're already one of us.
Have been for a while.

354
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,291
[gasps] Thank you, sir.

355
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,708
Cool! Well if Emilio's
gonna make it formal,

356
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,625
then I guess I should go ahead
make this thing official, too.

357
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,166
[MISCHA]
Are you asking to join?

358
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,791
Uh! What? No,
I don't have to!

359
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,541
Do you have any idea how
much I've contributed

360
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,666
to this adventure?

361
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,791
Practically nothing?

362
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,583
[SHUN]
No! Definitely something!

363
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,416
Look, a lot of it was
before you joined,

364
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,666
so it's no wonder
you don't know.

365
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,708
[MISCHA]
Strange...

366
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,291
Well. They truly are
a lively bunch.

367
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,083
[ELJUIA] And yet, for the long
journey we have ahead of us,

368
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,791
there's no one I would
rather have beside me.

369
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,708
So anyway, I think I'm gonna
keep helping you guys out

370
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,375
as well. At least until
I make it back home.

371
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,708
[PASCAL]
Speaking of,

372
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,958
I think we may find a lead
on that in the capital.

373
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:03,166
[SHUN] Oh, hey, Pascal.
What do you mean, the capital?

374
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,541
We've found out about as much
as we can from looking at Babel.

375
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,875
Mechanically,
it seems to be sound.

376
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,125
Our best theory at the
moment as to why it failed

377
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,916
is that it's being somehow
sealed from the surface.

378
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,833
There's no telling how
or why though, not yet.

379
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,291
[DEMETRIO sighs]
I see.

380
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,791
[LOUISE]
Wait.

381
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,083
So you think someone who lives
on the surface blocked it?

382
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,208
But if no one knows about Endora
there, then how could they?

383
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,125
That's not a bad question.

384
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,666
No, it's not. Who's to say?

385
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,000
But the two of you are
right, it does seem odd.

386
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,958
Perhaps the blockage
on the surface side

387
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,458
was a natural occurrence.

388
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,916
I think we'll find that such
conjecture is pointless

389
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,208
until we've given the
subject more research.

390
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,000
Shun.

391
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,208
[SHUN]
Mm?

392
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,875
[PASCAL]
Here are our options:

393
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,041
We can either continue
investigating Babel

394
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:49,166
in the hopes of finding some way
to unlock this seal for you,

395
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,708
or we can start from scratch,

396
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,083
and look for your passage
above elsewhere.

397
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,916
The good news is that regardless
of which path you choose,

398
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,750
it'll start with research
at the Royal Laboratory.

399
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,875
[DEMETRIO]
Our course is clear then.

400
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,458
We make our way to the capital,

401
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,166
bringing peace and order back
to each region we pass through

402
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,208
with either diplomacy,
or force of arms.

403
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,333
Okay, guys!

404
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,000
Let's get this train rollin'!

405
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,958
Why is Shun pretending
to be a leader?

406
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,166
[FALARION chirps]

407
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,208
[SHUN] I didn't mean to!
I just got excited.

408
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,833
[ALL laugh]

409

410

[ALICIA] Hey, Emilio.
Did something happen?

411
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,416
You seem a lot different,
better somehow.

412
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,125
I guess so.

413
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,500
[ALICIA, FALARION]
Huh?
