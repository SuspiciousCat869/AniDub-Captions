1
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,666
My name is Emilio Langheim.

2
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,708
I seek the leader
of the Ignauts.

3
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:24,750
[DEMETRIO]
Louise.

4
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,125
My name's Demetrio.

5
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,708
You can speak with me.

6
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,916
I'm curious. What brings
the Prince of Endora

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,625
to the realm of
his strongest foes?

8
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,125
You're the foes of the king.

9
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:42,250
And I wish for nothing
more than to see his end.

10
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,041
[EMILIO] I heard rumors about
the Ignauts when I was still

11
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,416
in the castle.

12
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,875
They say that you're a
band of renegades

13
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,666
who use hit and run tactics.

14
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,708
There are great warriors
in your ranks.

15
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,583
A group as powerful as the
Zoozians who serve Delzaine.

16
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,208
Well, if you think the
Truculent are a match for us,

17
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,583
then you can't be
too well informed.

18
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:49,958
So we'll teach you.

19
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,250
I'd rather kill them.

20
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,166
That would be
the safest choice,

21
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,750
now that they've
seen all our faces.

22
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,458
Uh... Do we get
a say in this?

23
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,708
[EMILIO]
I swear we won't turn you in.

24
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,625
I'll tell you all I know about
Delzaine's plans. Anything t--

25
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,041
[LOUISE]
I'm not sure we care.

26
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,083
Even if he happens to
know something we don't,

27
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,250
how can we trust him?

28
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,833
He's a dirty turncoat.

29
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,250
My thoughts exactly.

30
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,750
Not to mention he'll say
whatever it takes to be spared.

31
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,750
Do what you will!
But know this first:

32
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:18,041
The only purpose my life has
left is to end Delzaine's!

33
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,291
I'm not seeing it.

34
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,625
What could your father have
done to make you so intent

35
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:23,958
on slaying him?

36
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,166
[ELJUIA]
What's wrong?

37
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,416
If you're as passionate
as you claim,

38
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,250
then surely you
can tell us why.

39
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,583
I've yet to hear your
thoughts, Demetrio.

40
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,875
Shall we kill them, take them as
hostages, or waste more time?

41
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,458
What kind of
options are those?

42
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:39,625
[FELIX]
Quiet.

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,291
[EMILIO] They'd cut
our throats for nothing.

44
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,625
But I need their
strength to fight him.

45
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,291
If this is what
it takes to win...

46
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,958
...then so be it.

47
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,583
Allow me to
change the question.

48
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,125
Supposing you do
manage to kill the king...

49
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,750
What next?

50
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,416
I don't believe our young prince
has ever looked that far ahead.

51
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,750
Count on a prince to think of
nothing but his next desire.

52
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,250
Answer me!

53
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,166
The king's blood is spilt across
his throne; what do you do now?

54
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,625
As I've said...

55
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:19,291
The only thing I care about is
ensuring the king's demise.

56
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,833
So long as his fate's
the same, I'm ready to die!

57
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:28,875
[DEMETRIO laughing]

58
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,125
So you'll give it all up.

59
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:36,625
First your status,
then your life.

60
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,458
You speak like a fool.

61
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,458
And you're ready for nothing.

62
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,541
[DEMETRIO] I've heard my
share of rumors about you,

63
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,000
but none of them
mentioned you were daft.

64
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,791
I suppose the king
must blame himself.

65
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,958
For raising such an incompetent.

66
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,166
Poor guy.

67
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,541
Damn you!

68
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,541
[EMILIO yelling]

69
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,583
[EMILIO grunts]

70
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,583
What was that?

71
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,208
It looked like his weapon
popped out of nowhere!

72
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,416
His blade is quick.

73
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,916
Helps he doesn't
have to summon it.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,750
[DEMETRIO] Didn't think you
could be bested by a man

75
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,833
without a relic, now, did you?

76
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,166
Remember this:

77
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,791
It's not always about the
resources you're given

78
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,250
to work with.

79
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,333
What really counts
is how they're used.

80
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,791
What are you getting at?

81
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,166
Land, weapons, the
things that give one power...

82
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,833
They only count in terms of
the one who controls them.

83
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,208
A wise prince
uses them for good.

84
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,250
A fool throws them away.

85
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,041
'Kay...

86
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,708
Looks like your
plan's a bust, Emilio!

87
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,583
C'mon, let's get out of here!

88
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,833
[SHUN yells]

89
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,666
What the heck
did you just do to me?

90
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,208
Hey, let me down, will ya?

91
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,041
What, you just
gonna stand there?

92
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:03,958
Cut the cord already!

93
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,625
[EMILIO]
So what you're saying...

94
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,000
...is that if I intend
to kill the king...

95
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:12,291
Then before I do, I need to
be prepared to take his place.

96
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,541
Yeah. You could say that.

97
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,208
But regardless, I have no
intention of helping you.

98
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,458
If anyone brings down Delzaine,
it'll be the Ignauts.

99
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,500
And if we do choose
to back a successor,

100
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,875
it'll be for his merit,
not his lineage.

101
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,291
[EMILIO growls]

102
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,125
[SHUN] Fine! Then he'll prove
that he's good enough!

103
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,666
All you gotta do is
give him a chance,

104
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,208
and you'll find out he
can be the kind of king

105
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:37,125
you're looking for!
Let him show you what he's got!

106
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,083
Oh yeah? And who are you?

107
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,541
My name's Shun. Shun Asanaga.

108
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,375
[DEMETRIO chuckles]

109
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,500
[SHUN yelling]

110
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,583
I think I might take you
at your word, Shun,

111
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:56,041
but I'll also hold
you to it. Deal?

112
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,291
If you want to follow,
I won't stop you.

113
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,625
But should you join us,

114
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,208
you'll be expected
to do as you're told.

115
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,416
Are we really gonna add
these boys to our problems?

116
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,583
Before long, we'll
have more people swarming in

117
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,541
to follow you than
rations to feed them.

118
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,708
How do you plan to manage it?

119
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,458
He who doesn't work
doesn't eat, remember?

120
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,291
Their stomachs'll
keep 'em in line.

121
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,791
I'm grateful.

122
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,375
[DEMETRIO]
Don't get me wrong.

123
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,208
If later I decide you can't
become a worthy king,

124
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,833
you're on your own.

125
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,291
And if I prove myself?

126
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,041
[DEMETRIO]
Big "if."

127
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:31,500
But if it happens, I'll be
your sword from then on.

128
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,166
So do like your foreign
friend said you would.

129
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,750
Show us what you've got!

130
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,333
[PASCAL]
Whoa...

131
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,625
Why, this bread appears to be
modeled after the DNA sequence

132
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,458
of the majestic Endora frog!

133
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,458
And this bread here looks like
ancient script I once read!

134
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,375
[RODNEY] I'm afraid it's
just ordinary bread, sir.

135
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,541
You don't say?

136
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,458
Well it surely
could've fooled me.

137
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,000
So it goes.

138
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,791
That costume's absurd.

139
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,625
[RODNEY] So you're
on the run, I imagine,

140
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,750
what with that little
prank you pulled.

141
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,708
Yeah, it doesn't seem
they approved of the last

142
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,958
modification I made
to Babel's design.

143
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,250
Right.

144
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,625
I hear the king had people
studying those plans

145
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,250
you left at the lab
around the clock,

146
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,583
trying to figure out
where it all went to hell.

147
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,291
Lucky that our replacements
are such diligent workers.

148
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,416
Thanks to them, us
retired folk can sit back

149
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,916
and rest in comfort.

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,458
Don't play humble.

151
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,833
We both know you could've made
it harder if you'd cared to.

152
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,875
It's the whole Royal Laboratory
versus an old man's prank.

153
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,458
Why, they'd lose all dignity
if they hadn't found me out.

154
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,375
[chuckles]

155
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,750
So I know my bread's good,

156
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,833
but I doubt you
risked this trip for it.

157
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:45,666
How about you tell me
why you pulled that prank.

158
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,875
Ever since I joined
the Royal Laboratory,

159
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,333
I've had this growing
list of suspicions.

160
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,291
[RODNEY]
Ah, so it's about that.

161
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,250
And what if you knew for sure?

162
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,958
I couldn't tell you.

163
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,833
But now that my obstruction's
been discovered,

164
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,708
the rebuilding of Babel
will begin soon.

165
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,208
Before that happens,
I need to know...

166
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,833
What is Delzaine after?

167
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,166
What does the king stand
to gain by restoring contact

168
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,875
with the surface?

169
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,375
As you've seen,

170
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,625
his determination to restore
Babel borders on obsession.

171
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,125
His resolve has never wavered.

172
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,916
But as for his motives, I never
felt myself bold enough to ask.

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,291
I didn't, either.

174
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,708
There's no cause for us
to give up yet, my friend.

175
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,708
The king may have
completed Babel's plans,

176
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,500
but actually building it
is a whole 'nother matter.

177
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,291
I'll use the time that gives
us to find out what I can.

178
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,916
I'd be forever
in your debt!

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,291
[RODNEY] Just think of it as
a favor to an old colleague.

180
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,583
Invent some sort of
new baking pan for me

181
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,750
and we'll call it even.

182
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,333
I really appreciate it.

183
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,500
Anyway, I don't suppose
there's been any other word

184
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,166
from the Royal Laboratory?

185
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,750
I did hear a strange bit of news

186
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,625
from one of the
younger researchers.

187
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,250
He was on a team studying
Warp Particles.

188
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,875
[PASCAL]
And what did they discover?

189
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,041
That there are fewer
now than there used to be.

190
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,250
Warp Particle concentrations
have been shrinking for years.

191
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,833
[PASCAL]
I feared as much.

192
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,666
It isn't yet established that
this is happening everywhere.

193
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,083
So for now, the information's
being kept under wraps.

194
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,875
[PASCAL]
So what could this mean?

195
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,500
My source couldn't say,
but I plan to look into it.

196
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,416
There's one more thing.
About the prince.

197
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,833
I assume you haven't heard.

198
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,375
No, I have.

199
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,875
You're talking about how he ran
away from the castle, right?

200
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,708
I'm... well aware of it.

201
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,166
It's what he did before
that's concerning.

202
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,791
The prince is wanted by
the crown for treason.

203
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,083
And rightly.

204
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:30,166
Emilio tried to slay
his father while he slept.

205
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,291
[PASCAL gasps]

206
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,750
We need three more scouts
in the southern forest.

207
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:42,666
Whoa.

208
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,916
Follow me.

209
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,041
[FELIX]
Go and wait inside the tent.

210
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,916
[EMILIO]
Damn. How did we end up here?

211
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,958
[SHUN]
Don't you remember?

212
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,333
You had a plan.

213
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,291
[EMILIO] Yes, and you ruined
it with your dumb mouth.

214
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,000
[SHUN]
What? I totally saved us!

215
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,333
[EMILIO]
Stop yelling, nitwit!

216
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,833
Shut up!

217
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,083
You're the one who started
yelling first and you know it!

218
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,500
Like how it's your
fault that this happened

219
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,333
and you know it?

220
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,666
[SHUN]
Yeah, try again!

221
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,000
If it wasn't for me lyin' to
make you look good,

222
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,750
you'd be all sorts
of dead right now.

223
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,166
I was hoping to explain
myself to them on equal terms,

224
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,000
but then we were ambushed.

225
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,500
So these people are like
some kinda rebel army?

226
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,208
They seem pretty tough to me.

227
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,208
That Demetrio doesn't
even have a Warp Relic

228
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,833
and he still manages
to kick ass.

229
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,500
Are you completely
incapable of silence?

230
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,500
I'm pissed off that your
crummy little plan failed.

231
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,541
You owe me an apology!

232
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,916
My plan's not what failed!

233
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,791
You couldn't even answer
that one simple question!

234
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,250
Hey. So listen...

235
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,750
Do you really wanna
kill the king,

236
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,666
even though he's your father?

237
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,208
Of course I do.

238
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:47,500
At this point, it's the only
thing I push myself to live for.

239
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,500
[FELIX]
Get out.

240
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,125
We have some work for you two.

241
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,541
Now come.

242
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,791
I wonder what kinda work
revolutionaries get to do.

243
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,916
It's probably a lotta walkin'
around and helping people

244
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,458
in need, yeah?

245
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,416
Ooh, or better yet, maybe we'll
rob a bunch of rich bad guys

246
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,916
and give the money to the poor!

247
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Dude. We...

248
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,791
...aren't heroic.

249
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,208
[SHUN chuckles]

250
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,458
[FELIX] Laundry is heroic
work in its own right.

251
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,791
This isn't exactly what
I was hopin' for, but heck.

252
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,625
Fresh recruits gotta
start somewhere, right?

253
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,666
I'm game! Let's knock it out!

254
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,166
[DEMETRIO]
What's this?

255
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,416
Slacking off on the job already?

256
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,458
There something wrong
with your hands, prince?

257
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,500
I doubt he's cleaned his
own dirty clothes before,

258
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,333
let alone touched
someone else's.

259
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,125
Everyone takes turns between
cooking and laundry here.

260
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,125
We don't make
exceptions for royalty.

261
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,291
I get it, thanks.

262
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,458
So, you help with
the laundry too, boss?

263
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,833
[DEMETRIO]
Well yes, of course.

264
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,625
I mean, just because I help
come up with the rules

265
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,708
doesn't make me
exempt from them.

266
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:03,000
All of us are equal comrades.

267
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,583
That said, you two
are new here,

268
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,833
so you'd better listen to
what the others have to say.

269
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,291
Especially you.

270
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,875
It doesn't seem like
you're quite used to life

271
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,250
in Endora yet.

272
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,416
Wait...

273
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,583
I never said that
I was from the surface.

274
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,541
How did you know?

275
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,833
[DEMETRIO]
You just told me.

276
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,416
Idiot.

277
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,958
That was sneaky!

278
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,458
I'd suggest you try to avoid
letting anyone else find out.

279
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,333
Not everyone will be friendly.

280
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,916
[SHUN]
I'll do my best,

281
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,791
but shouldn't you be
a little more surprised?

282
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,166
The people who comprise Ignauts
come from every race

283
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,625
and background in Endora.

284
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,541
Honestly, I don't think
it changes much for us

285
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,833
to add one person
from above to the mix.

286
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:35,916
So that's it, then?

287
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,625
[DEMETRIO]
Nothing else to it.

288
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,916
Now get that laundry
washed, recruits.

289
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,541
He who doesn't work doesn't eat.

290
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,500
You heard the man,
right Prince Priss?

291
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:45,833
D'ya need me to
show you how to do it?

292
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,291
Never call me that again!

293
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,958
And no, I'm sure
whatever you'd show me

294
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:49,791
would only make it worse!

295
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,416
[SHUN chuckles]

296
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,208
[SHUN]
Hey, um... I was wondering,

297
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,333
are you as strong as
the other Ignauts, Eljuia?

298
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,833
Sorry if that's rude to ask.

299
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,375
You just seem like
a peaceful person.

300
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,583
[ELJUIA]
You're fine.

301
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,375
And it's true.
I'm rather poor at fighting.

302
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,250
However, I do have
some other talents,

303
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,583
and I like to think
that I pull my weight.

304
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,250
[ELJUIA yells]

305
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,541
[SHUN gasps]

306
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,208
Wait... A dude? No way!

307
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,791
[LOUISE laughs]
You couldn't tell before?

308
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,625
You must not have had
too much experience.

309
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,291
Shouldn't you be focused on
making sure your friend's okay?

310
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,833
These things happen
to him all the time.

311
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,875
I doubt you'll ever meet
someone with worse luck

312
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:44,875
than Eljuia.

313
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,083
He's always barely
evading death.

314
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,833
Though I guess that
kind of makes him lucky.

315
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,375
[ELJUIA coughing]

316
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,583
[DEMETRIO]
How do you feel, Eljuia?

317
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,083
Less than lucky.

318
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,916
Are you hurt or anything?

319
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,458
You saw something, didn't you?

320
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,375
[ELJUIA]
Yes.

321
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,833
What do you think he saw?

322
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,833
[FELIX]
The future. He can foresee it.

323
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,166
Ever since he was a child,

324
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,166
Eljuia has possessed
this strange ability.

325
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,625
Whenever he's in a dangerous or
emotionally volatile situation,

326
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,166
he can catch glimpses
into the future.

327
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,166
And you expect
us to believe that?

328
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,333
Although you have to admit,
it's pretty unlucky

329
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,666
that he was born with a power
he can never take control of.

330
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,375
You've gotta
tell me what you saw!

331
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,708
I mean, what was it like?

332
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,625
Talk to me, I'm dyin'!

333
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,958
Shun. I think I may
have seen your future.

334
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,625
[ELJUIA] You were standing in
a world I've never seen before.

335
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,333
The surface, I would imagine.

336
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,125
You were surrounded
by glass structures

337
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,041
that reached into the sky.

338
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,125
Skyscrapers? It's gotta be!

339
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,458
I'm really goin' home! Yeah!

340
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,916
Rather boisterous, isn't he?

341
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,541
You look more pale than usual.

342
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,083
Are you sure you're okay?

343
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,791
Don't worry. I'm fine.

344
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,041
[FALARION squeaks]

345
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:19,916
Emilio, you're--

346
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,625
Hey. How are ya?

347
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,541
Aw, man, it's only Pascal.

348
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:25,583
[PASCAL]
Geez.

349
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,625
Talk about a warm welcome.

350
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,583
Where are Emilio
and Shun, anyway?

351
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:30,833
I've got no idea.

352
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,083
They were both gone when
I woke up this morning!

353
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,000
Wait... Don't tell me...

354
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,750
Tell you what? I don't know!

355
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,791
[PASCAL]
Um, well...

356
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,958
[ALICIA] Does it have
to do with King Delzaine?

357
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,833
I feel like something happened
between him and Emilio.

358
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,166
I don't understand how
he can feel so much hatred

359
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,625
towards his own dad.

360
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:49,875
That's life for ya.

361
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,041
Some people never get
along with their folks.

362
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,750
Well, even if
they can't get along,

363
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:57,416
I hope those people realize
they're lucky to have parents.

364
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,083
Anyway, where do you
think they ran off to?

365
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,791
I have reason to suspect
the boys set out for Babylon

366
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:03,958
on their own.

367
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,041
We can still catch them
if we get moving.

368
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,166
Yeah!

369
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:17,875
[FALARION squeaks]

370
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,541
He's saying to go that way!

371
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,750
Roger that!

372
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,625
Those two are such jerks!

373
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:27,166
I can't believe they just up and
ditched me while I was asleep!

374
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,750
[ALICIA] Watch your backs,
boys, I'm comin' for ya!

375
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,583
That's that!

376
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,375
[EMILIO] Stop it. You have
no cause to be excited.

377
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,708
Of course I do.

378
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,208
I just found out I'm gonna
go back home for sure!

379
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,166
You have no idea
how good the food is.

380
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,208
Rancid frog meat
is all you know.

381
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,666
You're an imbecile.

382
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,291
You actually believe that man
can see into the future?

383
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,333
[SHUN]
Huh?

384
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,250
It must be nice
not having to think.

385
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,500
We've only been here for a day,

386
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,583
and already you eat
every lie they feed you.

387
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,250
[SHUN] The way you slack off,
you'll be lucky if they

388
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,458
feed you at all!

389
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,666
Why did you want to
team up with these guys

390
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,083
if you don't trust them?

391
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,375
[EMILIO] There's a difference
between trusting them

392
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,250
and making use of them.

393
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,208
Make sure to keep your guard up.

394
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,250
You can be a friendless
joy sucker if you want,

395
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,041
but don't drag me into it.

396
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,416
It's like you're a stray puppy,

397
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,625
buddying up to anyone
who tosses you a bone!

398
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,458
I don't trust just anybody.
I listen to my gut.

399
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,833
And yeah, these people
scared me at first.

400
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,458
But now that they're
not threatening us,

401
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,875
I'm startin' to like them.

402
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,500
[EMILIO] You should learn
to be a skeptic before you

403
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,250
get yourself hurt.

404
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,791
No one shares their
true intentions

405
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,500
unless they get found out.

406
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,000
But if you're always paranoid,
you can't trust anyone.

407
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,166
That's no way to live, man.

408
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,625
You've no right to tell me
how to live my life!

409
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,833
[SHUN]
What the hell, dude?

410
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,708
You're even meaner than usual!

411
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,958
I get it. You're lashing out
cause you're gonna be lonely

412
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,708
once I go back to the surface.

413
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,125
Don't make me laugh.

414
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,833
It'll be a load off my
shoulders once I'm rid of you.

415
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,375
Of course, that's assuming you
can actually make it back.

416
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,916
[SHUN] You've got a real crummy
way of showin' gratitude.

417
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,833
I can't believe I
decided to help you.

418
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,583
[EMILIO]
So leave. See if I care.

419
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,083
Oh wait, you need my help so
you can run back to the surface

420
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,416
and cry to your mommy.

421
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,958
[SHUN] You are so mind-blowingly
full of yourself!

422
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,291
You think I need you?
I saved your damn life!

423
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,125
You wonder why you
don't have many friends?

424
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,958
'Cause no one wants to help
a smug, condescending jerk!

425
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,208
You're like Demetrio,
but on opposite day.

426
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,625
[EMILIO]
What do you know about me?

427
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,250
Well why would I
want to know anything

428
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,250
about a monster who tries
to kill his own father?

429
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,583
You bastard!

430
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,125
What? Let's go then.

431
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,166

00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,000
Ow! Son of a--

437
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,166
[DEMETRIO]
Now this is a show!

438
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,208
I don't suppose
we plan to stop them?

439
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,958
I doubt those brats can
do any real damage.

440
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:23,125
They'll probably stop
once they get hungry.

441
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,875
You know how the saying goes.

442
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,416
Oh, I remember.

443
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,041
"It's those who fight
that get along the best."

444
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,625
So this is how
men secretly bond?

445
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,166
Ridiculous.

446
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,583
[yelling]

447
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:47,041
