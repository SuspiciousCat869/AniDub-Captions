Have the archers
tar their arrows.

156
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,875
I'll take that town
or burn it to ash!

157
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,041
So those Ignauts
think they've won?

158
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,875
Well, they're about to learn
what happens when noble blood

159
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,208
is brought to anger!

160
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:43,208
We'll see who's laughing,
then. Hey. What's wrong?

161
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:47,250
Don't just stand there, get
moving! Ready my troops!

162
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,625
[gasps]

163
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:02,583
S-Somebody help me! Help me!

164
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,250
[LORD 15A]
Guards! Come at once!

165
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,958
[IBELDA] There's no point.
We're all alone.

166
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,666
[LORD 15A]
You there. Who are you?

167
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,833
[IBELDA] Someone with
a... shared interest.

168
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:15,791
[IBELDA laughs]

169
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,000
[LORD 15A whimpers]

170
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,250
[DEMETRIO] You want to find
that lord and... "talk"?

171
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,458
[EMILIO] Yes. We all heard
what the village elder said.

172
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,583
And he is absolutely right--
that lord is remorseless.

173
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:28,958
Once we depart
from this villiage,

174
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,291
it's just a matter of time

175
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,291
before he attacks these
people yet again.

176
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,708
We don't have time for this.

177
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,916
I'd be all for it,
but our Zoozian allies

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,208
are in just as much
peril as this town.

179
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,750
They're right.

180
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,541
These aren't the only people
who're in need of assistance.

181
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,125
And anyway,

182
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,458
do you really think that you can
persuade this lord to change?

183
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:49,208
No. But I have
things to ask him.

184
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,791
Such as?

185
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:55,000
Ever since Babylon, I've been
trying to figure something out.

186
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,750
How can I make an impact?

187
00:09:56,833 --> 00:10:00,041
How can I make life
for more people good?

188
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:03,250
But talking to that elder last
night, I realized something.

189
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,583
That question's still too big
for someone as ignorant as me.

190
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,625
If I'm to change people's lives,
I need to learn from them.

191
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,500
The good and the bad.

192
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,166
Okay, but how can you be sure
that this lord'll even give you

193
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,416
an audience?

194
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,291
Only thing to know about
brutes like him is that

195
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,750
they can't be reasoned with.

196
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,041
Here's an idea, just
be like "you there!

197
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,458
Do you have any idea
who you're speaking to?"

198
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,791
and when ya show 'em
the King's Seal,

199
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,250
they'll be all "yes milord!"

200
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,666
You could probably get that
lord guy to bow and stuff!

201
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,000
He'll do whatever you say.

202
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,375
Sometimes I forget
how stupid you are.

203
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,291
Can it, gloomy boy. Delzaine
never disinherited you--

204
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,291
that means you're
still his successor.

205
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,750
[EMILIO]
Yes. But--

206
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,333
That lord would
have to be a fool

207
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,375
to refuse to see
the king's heir.

208
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,791
So go "Seal of the King! Here!"

209
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,791
And he'll be all "sorry sir!"

210
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,416
Nowhere under Adamas
has such an odd gesture

211
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,375
been mistaken for etiquette.

212
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,625
All right. If you wanna
speak with this lord, go.

213
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,583
[EMILIO]
I appreciate it. See you soon.

214
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,333
Actually, I'm coming
along with you.

215
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,291
[EMILIO]
Very well.

216
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,666
Then I'm going, too.

217
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,875
[FELIX, MISCHA grunt]

218
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,666
And since these two
will want to watch me,

219
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,458
there's hardly any
point in splitting up.

220
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,291
[DEMETRIO] No. We need
to limit our numbers.

221
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,791
If we're to keep
this diplomatic,

222
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,250
we can't look too threatening.

223
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,666
Why did you have
to come along too?

224
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,791
Thought you'd need a back to
hide behind if things get rough.

225
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,916
How original...

226
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,916
This the place?

227
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So it would appear.

228
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,875
It's massive!

229
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,291
How many rooms do ya
think the place has?

230
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,541
[EMILIO]
Feel free to stay behind

231
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,125
and count them once we're done.

232
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:41,041
[SHUN] Uh. Does it seem weird to
you guys that nobody's around?

233
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,833
Wouldn't you think that
there'd be a few soldiers

234
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,250
up on the walls at least?

235
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,916
And for a castle gate to be
both open and unmanned

236
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,041
in a time of war... Mm.

237
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,625
What's wrong?

238
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,208
[ELJUIA]
I... For a split second,

239
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,333
I felt a highly
abnormal presence.

240
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,583
[DEMETRIO]
Let's go in, but stay on guard.

241
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,500
[SHUN]
This place is swanky.

242
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,375
It makes the elder's
house look like a pig sty.

243
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,458
[ELJUIA]
That it does.

244
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,500
For a lesser lord
to be so wealthy,

245
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,666
he must tax his people
half to death.

246
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,000
So he took it all
from some villagers.

247
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:15,291
How can we get a guy like this
to look at them as people?

248
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,541
[EMILIO grunts]

249
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:25,166
[SHUN] To be honest, this is
startin' to give me the creeps.

250
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,791
There oughtta be
at least a few s--

251
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,000
Shh!

252
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,500
You hear somethin'?

253
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,333
What is it?

254
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,291
[ELJUIA]
That room is not empty.

255
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:40,750
[ALL gasp]

256
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,583
What? Why are you here?

257
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,875
[SHUN] Good! You remember
us from yesterday!

258
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,166
[LORD 15A] Damn it.
What do you want with me?

259
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,375
Go! Get away!

260
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,500
We only intend to talk with you.

261
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,250
Talk? A-About what?

262
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,916
We would like for you to
put an end to your raiding.

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,583
[LORD 15A grunts]
I suppose I should've known

264
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,291
it'd be something stupid.

265
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,958
It's only natural for the
strong to take from the weak!

266
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,791
So why should I stop?

267
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,583
So the weak can get strong!

268
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,333
Help these towns instead
of preying on them.

269
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,291
Doing so wouldn't actually
make you any weaker yourself.

270
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,041
You'd gain good allies.

271
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,541
[LORD 15A] Have a lot of
experience ruling, do you?

272
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,583
[gasps]

273
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,625
Let's say I disband
my army today.

274
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,250
Those precious villagers of
yours'll end up at each other's

275
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,125
throats by tomorrow. The first
thing you should know

276
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:30,416
about war is that kind
men never last!

277
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,041
You're totally full of it!
Don't try to convince me to act

278
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,250
like an entitled bastard
just 'cause you do!

279

[whimpers]

280
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,958
[SHUN, EMILIO]
Uh?

281
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,291
[LORD 15A] W-Wait, listen!
You can take whatever you want.

282
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,750
I'll do anything, I swear!
Just spare me!

283
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,083
[SHUN] Whoa, I never thought
I could be this intimidating.

284
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,750
Chill out, man, if we'd
come here to kill you,

285
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,250
we wouldn't be
talkin' right now.

286
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,333
Please don't do this! I'm
begging you, don't murder me!

287
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,708
Something isn't right here.

288
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,375
Agreed, the man's abject terror

289
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,458
seems to be unrelated
to our presence.

290
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,625
Stay away! Just stay away!

291
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,583
Seriously, what's going on?

I'm sorry. Please don't--

How are you still alive?

[IBELDA laughs] Well I wouldn't
quite say it was "good" luck.

[ELJUIA]
This can't be.

305

You should have died
when Babel failed!

306

I couldn't die, I had too
many scores left to settle.

307
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,500
Funny, I was certain that if I
wreaked enough havoc

308
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,416
I would draw you
Ignauts in eventually,

309

but I never imagined I would
find you with so little effort.

00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,875
Why, I haven't even razed
a single village yet!

[SHUN, EMILIO growl]

312
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,791
[IBELDA] I've been through worse
than the wound I got from you,

313
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,041
but it's that wound
that's kept me going.

314
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,875
It's important to have
things to look forward to.

315
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,958
I've been imagining all
the different ways

316
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,375
I could kill you boys.

317
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:17,458
And decided that first I'll
give you scars to match mine!

318
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:25,458
Demetrio. We do have him
outnumbered. Should we fight?

319
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,583
We should. I'll take him
head on! You two flank him!

320
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,750
[BOTH]
Right!

321
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:33,375
Come out from your shield
and fight! H'ya!

322
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,208
Is that the best you can do?

--Damn.
--[ELJUIA]  Demetrio!

334

Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

335
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,083
No, but I assume it was caused
by Babel's malfunction.

336
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,166
I can't imagine what
happened in there.

337
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,000
But there's no way exposure to
such power leaves you untouched.

Shun! Emilio!

343
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,875
It's a shame you have
your hands full,

344
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,291
or you could help 'em out.

345
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,041
So... something tells me
we're not gonna be able to

346
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,500
talk our way outta
this place after all.

347
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,083
We wouldn't even be here if
I hadn't had the stupid idea

348
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,125
to come and talk
sense into that lord.

349
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,166
I could never really
change the world.

350
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,000
Who the hell do I think I am?

351
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,541
Well if you're always dwelling
on every mistake you make

352
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,791
until it feels you're drowning
in them, then yeah!

353
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,541
You'll prove yourself right.

[EMILIO, SHUN grunting]

355
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,958
But you don't have to do that!

356
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,708
Deal with the problems
in front of you instead!

357
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,458
All right. I'll try it!

358
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000

I've decided that
I'd like to start

364

this little bloodbath with you.

Well, look at you.

Is that...

00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,375
Guidoro.

376
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:57,000
I never got a chance to
thank you for Babel. Ibelda.

377
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:00,958
[IBELDA laughs]
You cheated death somehow.

Not that I have room to
talk on the subject.

than a scratch on the chest!

[ELJUIA] How's your throat?
Can you breathe?

385
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,583
I'm fine.

386
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,666
How many of these
things are there?

[GUIDORO yelling]

388
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,208
What are you after, Guidoro?

389
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,666
The king you served is dead

390
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,333
and so are all the rest of
your Truculent buddies!

391
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:44,041
You don't have a boss
or a crew at this point.

392
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,750
There isn't anything left
for you to fight for!

393
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:50,041
Right, my original purpose for
fighting has been taken from me,

394
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:53,000
by a craven wretch I
once called comrade.

395
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:56,416
Thus, for as long
as you draw breath,

396
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,208
I'll have more than
enough hatred to fight.

397
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,708
I'll do whatever it
takes to see you dead!

[IBELDA] There's a real fire
to that hatred of yours.

401
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,708
Think I'll let it smolder.

402
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,375
I'd feel wrong if I put
it out it too soon.

403
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,125

Till next time!

[SLIME grunting]

405
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,500
Even if I have to chase you
to the end of the world,

406
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,250
I will watch the life
drain from your eyes.

407

[DEMETRIO]
I owe you my gratitude.

408

That might've gone badly
if you hadn't shown up.

409
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,458
[GUIDORO] I came for Ibelda.
Had no intention of saving you.

410
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:43,000
Yet somehow your blade ended
up between his and my neck.

411

Where are you headed?

Who knows.

413
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,625
Well, if you're on the fence,

414
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,541
then you should consider
coming along with us.

Uh...

00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,708
A common enemy's not a
bad way to make friends.

418
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,625
[GUIDORO]
Think about what you're saying.

419
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:01,875
I've fought against you Ignauts
since the rebellion's earliest

420
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,708
days. Who has spilt more of
your friends' blood than me?

421
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,458
[DEMETRIO]
Probably no one.

422
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,625
But I've fought against
you long enough to know

423
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,458
that you're both honorable
and talented.

424
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,083
I offer no pretense.

425
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,333
My sole objective is to
avenge my dead comrades.

426
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,041
The only reason
I'd join would be

427
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,750
in order to achieve that goal.

428
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,333
You find that acceptable?

429
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,708
I certainly do.

430
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,250
He's outdone himself.

431
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,958
This could actually be the least
popular decision he's made.

432

[gasps]

433
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,458
Demetrio's famous for
making the kind of calls

434
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,083
that most would disagree with.

435
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,958
But recruiting the leader
of the Truculent...

436
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,375
[laughs] Expect a show.

437
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,208
[SHUN] Don't worry,
I'll show ya the ropes!

438
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,125
And put in a good word for ya,
help ease things along.

439
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,291
I'll tell 'em you're a big
amphibious teddy bear.

440
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:48,000
With a heart as warm
as your blood is cold.

441
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,875
Stop pretending you matter,
Shun. Nobody buys it.

442
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,291
Ignore that jerk.

443
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,208
Anyway, since you just
joined the Ignauts,

444
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,458
that makes me your
senior, ya got it?

445

or like ya aren't bein'

446
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,166
treated like one of us
then look around for

447
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,708
big brother Shun, and I'll
make it all better, 'kay?
