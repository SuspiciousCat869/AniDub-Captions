Endora, heed my warning!

2
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:16,583
Delzaine, our trusted king has
sinned gravely against us!

00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:20,083
I shall tell you of the truth
he sought to conceal!

4
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:23,458
This country stares
up at the face of calamity!

5
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:27,666
The Warp Particles that sustain
our world have been leaving it.

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,208
You have heard that
the king was killed.

7
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,625
I tell you that he
has abandoned us!

8
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,791
Rather than aid his people,
he's left for the surface!

00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:40,083
Make your peace, my friends.
Soon Adamas will lose its light,

10
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,791

left in darkness.

11
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,041
[WOMAN 16A]
The plants will wither.

12
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,208
The livestock will starve.

13
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,958
[MAN 16A]
We have no future without light.

14
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:50,416
[MAN 16B] This can't be real.
I don't wanna die!

15
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,666
[GRADIDO] So the king was
killed by his own man.

16
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,000
[DEMETRIO]
That's right.

17
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,708
This Ibelda must be quite
formidable to have been

18
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,791
able to wreak so
much havoc alone.

19
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,791
And I can tell you in
no uncertain terms

20
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,208
we'll have to deal with
him again before long.

21
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,500
But for now, the defense of
your island takes priority.

22
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,958
How's it look?

23
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,250
[GRADIDO] Well, the enemy
has five ships with cannon.

24
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,500
They're awaiting our surrender.

25
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,541
[DEMETRIO]
Hopefully we can get to them

26
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,833
before they decide
to land troops.

27
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,583
The men I sent should
help prevent that.

28
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,541
[GRADIDO] I'm trying not to
think of what could happen

29
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,000
in my absence.

30
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,458
The Ignauts' help has been
invaluable, we won't forget.

31
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,500
Truly, your people have
done more than enough

32
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,708
to earn our support.

33
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:07,708
[door opens]

34
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:08,458
[GRADIDO]
Huh?

35
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,708
[SHUN]
So what?

36
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,208
Did you figure out what
the deal is with Babel?

37
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,958
[PASCAL]
All will be revealed in time.

38
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,125
[SHUN]
Whatever you say.

39
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,708
Joseph and I have
gleaned some more

40
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,125
information regarding
Babel. Care to hear?

41
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,041
I certainly would.

42
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:30,250
[JOSEPH] Here it is. The
ultimate Babel diagram!

43
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,333
[SHUN] Yeah that picture's
pretty useless to me.

44
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,583
Uh!

45
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,916
[SHUN] Ugh. Just walk
me through it, will ya?

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,291
As everybody knows, Babel is
essentially an ancient tunnel.

47
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,041
A gateway that allows
individuals to travel freely

48
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,041
between Endora and the surface.

49
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,625
Ah...

50
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,833
[PASCAL] The work I've done on
Babel has only ever dealt with

51
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,541
the parts of it that
are within Endora.

52
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,000
We can find nothing
wrong with those parts.

53
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,250
So it stands to reason
that there's a blockage

54
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,833
near the surface.

55
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,958
The data we got from
the gauges we repaired

56
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,541
only served to confirm the utter
flawlessness of Pascal's design.

57
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,208
So, while Ibelda did experience
particle disassembly,

58
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,208
he obviously was not
transported to the surface.

59
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,875
[PASCAL] I believe that event
is what corrupted him.

60
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,291
Babel's essentially
a dead end alley now.

61
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,583
Who can say what Ibelda
found in there?

62
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,916
Could be that their
particles were blended.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,750
And to think, I wanted to
be the first one through.

64
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:22,833
[PASCAL]
There's also one more thing

65
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,458
to be learned from all this.

66
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,291
[SHUN, ALICIA gasp]

67
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,000
There is? What is it?

68
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,916
It pertains to the
disappearing Warp Particles.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,541
Wait, what are those
things again? I forget.

70
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,791
Just the energy that gives form
and life to all of Endora.

71
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,666
Oh, that rings a bell.

72
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,208
It's the stuff that lets us
use our Warp Relics, right?

73
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,708
[PASCAL]
Precisely.

74
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,833
And we've discovered that
for reasons unknown,

75
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,708
these particles have diminished
in number over recent years.

76
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,750
At one point, Joseph and I
hypothesized that the phenomenon

77
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:53,333
was somehow connected to
the reconstruction of Babel.

78
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,416
But if we look at the
example of Ibelda,

79
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,541
it seems that most particles
entering Babel

80
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,958
do eventually come out.

81
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:02,083
So essentially, we're back
to the drawing board.

82
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,958
[DEMETRIO]
Rough news.

83
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,791
And the particles are
still disappearing

84
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,166
after Babel's failure?

85
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,291
[DEMETRIO] If so, it's
starting to look like

86
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,833
Eljuia's apocalypse
might happen after all.

87
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:13,916
[SHUN, ALICIA gasp]

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It makes sense.
When he said that Endora

89
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,791
was losing the forces
that keep it whole,

90
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,000
he must've meant
the Warp Particles.

The message I received
this morning

94
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:25,833
makes a lot more sense now.

95
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:26,875
Message?

96
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,791
It came from an ally
in the capital.

97
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,833
Seems your psychic
friend's not the only one

98
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,583
who thinks the world
might be ending.

99
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,625
A radical group is
preaching the same there--

100
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,333
inciting the people to panic.

101
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,666
Not good!

102
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,083
The darker the rumor,
the faster it will spread.

103
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,208
And people who feel like
they have nothing to lose

104
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:45,375
are prone to riot. This rumor
has effectively crippled

105
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,833
the Royal Guard's ability
to keep the peace.

106
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,541
As if there wasn't enough
chaos before all this.

107
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,541
Spreading panic about
the end of the world

108
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,333
is the last thing this
divided country needs.

109
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,708
There's yet another fire
that needs putting out.

110

Emilio...

111

[JOSEPH]
We can do it!

112
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,291
The first step is to put
everything we have

113
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,541
into ascertaining why

114

the Warp Particles are
beginning to disappear.

115
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,166
Once we know that, we should
be able to make a plan

116
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,916
and assuage the fears
of the people.

117

I'm sure that Pascal
can handle both.

Of course! It'd be foolish to

314
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,750
Huh?

315
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,583
Something that no one
can do but you.

316
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,833
Are you serious?
What is it? Tell me!

317
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,000
[LOUISE]
It's obvious.

318
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,750
You need to get
married to Emilio

319
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,333
and help him restore
that Royal bloodline!

320
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,583
[ALICIA]
Ah!

321
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,583
That really is something
that no one's capable of

322
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:16,833
aside from Alicia.

323
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,375
No. What? Why me?!

324
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:22,000
Because you're the only girl
that the prince even looks at.

325
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,208
And the color of your heart
changes when you're near him.

326
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,375
I've seen it.

327
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,000
[FALARION chirps]

328
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,291
No it doesn't!

329
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,041
Or if it does that's just
because we've known

330
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,416
each other since we were kids!

331
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,750
That's all there is to it.
We're friends, okay?

332
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,375
Plus, it's super obvious
that he isn't into me.

333
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,708
I mean, he ditches me
every chance he gets.

334
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,625
Yeah, he does kinda do that.

335
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,083
So maybe you're more of
a nagging mother figure.

336
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,208
[yelps, groans]

337
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,625
[ELJUIA]
Louise.

338
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,208
What, I'm only
telling her straight.

339
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,250
[ALICIA] Honestly, I don't
even know how I feel.

340
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,750
[ELJUIA, LOUISE gasp]

341
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,791
I'm usually too busy worrying
to think about that stuff.

342
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,916
Like when I found out that
it was possible for him

343
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,833
to get trapped inside of a Warp
Relic. It scared me to death.

344
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,416
[chirps]

345
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,833
[ELJUIA]
There's no need to worry.

346
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,125
I haven't sensed even
the tiniest bit of hatred

347
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,375
from him recently.

348
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,625
[LOUISE] Why not talk to
him about how you feel?

349
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,833
[ALICIA]
Emilio has too much on his mind.

350
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:16,375
He's still trying to figure out
his purpose in the world.

351
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,458
And honestly, I need do
the same thing myself.

352
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,583
If I'm still at his side after
we've done what we need to do,

353
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,416
things will be more clear.

354
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,166
I'll know for sure how I feel.

355
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,500
And at that point,

356
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,541
I don't think I'll be scared
to tell him anymore.

357
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,250
I understand completely.

358
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,583
[ALICIA, LOUISE]
Uh?

359
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,000
You just described the way
I feel about Demetrio.

360
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:36,833
[MISCHA]
Huh?

361
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,083
[ELJUIA sighs]

362
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,333
[LOUISE] Oh, I didn't
know it was like that.

363
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,708
Romantic rival.

364
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,541
[ELJUIA]
I've been quiet for so long,

365
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,791
but I do want to tell him what
it means for our purposes

366
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,708
to be intertwined.

367
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,625
Someday, right?

368
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,833
Uh. Hey, worth a shot.

369
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,375
Hope you don't screw it up.

370
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,458
[laughs]

371
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,291
[CRUM cries]

372
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,833
[SHUN] If you want to be strong,
don't cry like a baby.

373
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,500
[gasps]

374
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,875
Hey.

375
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,333
[SHUN] I get it. If Gradido
goes on this mission,

376
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,541
you won't get to see
him for a while.

377
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:10,791
[CRUM]
Mm...

378
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:11,458
[EMILIO gasps]

379
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,875
[SHUN, CRUM]
Uh?!

380
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,875
[laughs]

381
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,208
Your dad know where you are?

382
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,833
Won't he be worried
that you're gone?

383
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,583
[CRUM] Please don't tell him
I was still crying, okay?

384
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:27,541
Sure. But you should tell
him what you're feeling.

385
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,083
[CRUM] I can't. I have
to act like I'm strong,

386
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,541
or he won't feel right
about leaving me behind.

387
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,625
Tough break.

388
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,166
[EMILIO]
It's not weak to have feelings.

389
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,500
[CRUM, SHUN]
Mm?

390
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,375
Your father isn't trying
to help us save the world

391
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,708
because he's a leader
among the Zoozians.

392
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,458
He's about to embark on
a very dangerous mission,

393
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,416
and he's doing it
because he has you.

394
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,541
So tell him if you're sad.

395
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:53,541
Tell him how much you
love him and admire him.

396
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,833
[CRUM] He'll just be ashamed
that I'm so weak.

397
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,416
Come on now,

398
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,083
I think you owe your old man a
little more credit than that.

399
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,708
[EMILIO]
He's your father. Talk to him.

400
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,333
[CRUM]
Okay.

401
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,166
[SHUN] Looks like I got
more fish than you!

402
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:10,791
[EMILIO]
Shut up.

403
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,166
[SHUN, CRUM laugh]

404
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,333
[GRADIDO] Crum! Home before
dusk. You know the rule.

405
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,208
[CRUM]
Sorry, lost track of time!

406
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,166
Our bad.

407
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,541
[GRADIDO]
Uh?

408
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,166
[CRUM]
Father.

409
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,375
I wanted to say... to say
good luck with your mission!

410
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,583
[gasps]

411
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,041
[CRUM] Mother and I will
take care of things

412
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,750
while you're gone. But...
we'll still miss you. So...

413
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,708
...come back as soon
as you can, 'kay?

414
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,916
[GRADIDO]
Spoken well, my son.

415
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,291
Uh!

416
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,625
For the sake of you and
your mother I'll do my best

417
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,125
to finish this task
as swiftly as possible.

418
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,791
As you are my pride, so
shall I strive to be yours.

419
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,625
[CRUM gasps, laughing]

420
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,875
[SHUN snoring]

421
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,958
[PASCAL]
It's time to call it a night.

422
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,666
We're heading out
early tomorrow.

423
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,041
I can't sleep.

424
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,833
I know just how you feel.

425
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,583
But if we try to rush things,
we'll only make mistakes.

426
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:10,333
[JOSEPH]
Right.

427
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:11,833
[knocking]

428
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:16,583
[PASCAL] Emilio? What brings
you here so late?

429
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,791
[EMILIO]
I need to ask you something.

430
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,125
I'll excuse myself.

431
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,958
[EMILIO]
Don't. You're welcome to stay.

432
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,291
[JOSEPH]
Mm?

433
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,375
So, Delzaine. You mentioned
there was something

434
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,041
you wanted to
ask him, right?

435
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,458
You're wishing you'd known
more about the king.

436
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,708
[EMILIO]
Yeah.

437
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,541
I see. Understand that
this is just a guess,

438
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,875
but I suspect that the king
may have been trying

439
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,708
to meet someone who
lives on the surface.

440
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:38,875
[EMILIO gasps]

441
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,250
This would have begun
a number of years

442
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,166
before your biological
father, Alzerm Langheim,

443
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,500
came into the throne.

444
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,208
Prince Delzaine was tasked
with unifying the north.

445
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,583
And I have reason to believe

446
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,333
that this is when
he found Babel.

447
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,333
Is there any chance it was
still operational at the time?

448
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,666
[PASCAL]
It's possible.

449
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,125
He was the first person to
reach it since the fall.

450
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:01,166
Do you have any idea what
he might've seen there?

451
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,166
Afraid not. I've scoured
the Royal Library

452
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,666
for documents from
that campaign,

453
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,166
but I came up empty-handed.

454
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,958
King Alzerm likely knew.

455
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,833
I don't suppose you
might remember anything

456
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,375
he said about it.

457
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,708
[EMILIO] No. I wouldn't
even know his face.

458
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,291
Unfortunately, Emilio
was only two years old

459
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,083
at the time of his
father's death.

460
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,583
None of us remember
being that young.

461
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,708
There are so many questions
that I should've asked before.

462
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,458
That's all right, it's never too
late to start learning more.

463
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,000
The Royal Library has a
great number of records

464
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,958
concerning King Alzerm.

465
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,333
But it's King Delzaine who I
really want to know more about.

466
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,500
I think I owe it to him and
myself to find out the truth.

467
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,833
If you'd like, I'd be
happy to start you off

468
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,708
by telling you everything
I know about him.

469
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:47,083
My experience is limited,
but I'd like to help as well.

470
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,958
Thank you both.

471
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,750
[GRADIDO] Well, I'll be sure to
report my progress up north.

472
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,625
Looking forward to it.

473
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,083
[GRADIDO] I know that it was you
who suggested that some Ignauts

474
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:02,208
accompany us.
You have my gratitude.

475
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,291
You're welcome.

476
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,041
[CRUM]
Father!

477
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,208
When I grow up,

478
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,583
I'm gonna join the
Ignauts just like you!

479
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,791
And when I do,

480
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,791
the two of us can travel
the world together!

481
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,416
I like that plan!
Tell ya what, kid,

482
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,875
you can be a future Ignaut
starting right this second!

483
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,041
[CRUM]
Thank you! Uh...

484
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,166
Uh. My name is Shun.

485
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,541
Shun Asanaga. And his name is...

486
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:27,125
...Emilio. Emilio Langheim.

487
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,208
I'm the son of King Delzaine.

488
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,375
[ALL gasp]

489
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,875
That explains a few things.

490
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,833
[GRADIDO]
It seems Demetrio found it.

491
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,250
Wait, what do you mean?

492
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,583
The flame of hope
for this country.

493
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,458
For now, it's small,
and flickering.

494
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:51,083
But soon it will be a
great beacon for all.

495
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:56,125
I thought you'd given up
on your fancy royal status.

496
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,833
I was planning to.

497
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,625
But if there's still good
that I can do with it,

498
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,708
I won't turn my back
on the people out there

499
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,750
who need my help.

500
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,833
[SHUN]
I see.

501
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,916
