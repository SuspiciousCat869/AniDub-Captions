1
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,958
Come on, we've gotta
take him down, Emilio.

2
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:18,916
Together we have a chance!

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,916
[gasps] Don't worry,
I've got your back.

4
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:28,458
[yells]

5
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,041
Get him! [yells]

6
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,875
[BOTH yelling]

7
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,708
[SHUN, EMILIO grunting]

8
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,000
Damn!

9
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,166
It's pointless.

10
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,083
You have no chance
against my Warp Relic.

11
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,916
[SHUN gasping]

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,666
[groans]

13
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,833
Shun!

14
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,583
I should've known
it was a mistake

15
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,250
to allow the Prince
of Endora to live.

16
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,791
I could have dealt
with you on the day

17
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,833
you stumbled into my office.

18
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,041
Just like I dealt
with your father.

19
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,791
You bastard!

20
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:52,333
[ASANAGA]
Oh? So your Warp Relic evolved?

21
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,000
That's twice now.

22
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,333
How ironic.

23
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,875
The depth of your hatred
for me has given strength

24
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,166
to your Warp Relic.
Hardly surprising though.

25
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,625
[EMILIO]
You're wrong about that.

26
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,375
[ASANAGA]
Hm?

27
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,083
[EMILIO]
I'll readily admit that hatred

28
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,666
drove me to fight
for most of my life.

29
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,708
There was a time when it was
all that drove me to live.

30
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,458
But, that time has passed.

31
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:19,125
Because now, now I fight
for the people I care for.

32
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:22,208
And to protect the world
that I call my home.

33
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,291
That's what gives me strength!

34
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,166
Did he just give a
heroic monologue?

35
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,083
[EMILIO gasping]

36
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,333
It doesn't seem to have given
you that much strength.

37
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,708
More than you'll ever have!

38
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:42,833
[gasps]

39
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,833
[gasps, grunting]

40
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,541
[gasps]

41
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,500
[ASANAGA growls]

42
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:00,625
[EMILIO groans]

43
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,833
Leave him be!

44
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,666
It seems yours has
evolved as well.

45
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,958
[SHUN] I've been pretty
ignorant up until now, Dad.

46
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:25,666
About you. About the world
underneath my feet.

47
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,875
About who I am
and where I belong.

48
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,166
Part of me was
happy not knowing.

49
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,791
But I learned anyway,
and I'm glad that I did.

50
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,166
And now that I've
seen the truth,

51
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,916
I'll never let myself forget!

52
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,375
[ASANAGA grunts]

53
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,375
[JOSEPH]
Pascal!

54
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,583
[RALPH]
Can you hear us?

55
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,791
[JOSEPH panting]

56
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,666
If you're out there, please,
you gotta say something!

57
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,333
[PASCAL]
I'm here!

58
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,500
[PASCAL coughs]

59
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,791
[PASCAL sighs] It's about
time you boys showed up

60
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,041
[JOSEPH]
You really made it!

61
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,583
[laughs]

62
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,791
[JOSEPH] Were you injured
at all? Can you move?

63
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,875
[PASCAL]
Yeah, once I get down from here.

64
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,416
You know, Rodney made fun of me

65
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,333
when I told him about
the parachute sewn into

66
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,208
the back of my jacket.
Who's laughing now though?

67
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:29,541
Thank goodness.
I knew you'd be fine!

68
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,208
Yeah, Joseph was pretty
worried about you.

69
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,166
You should've seen him.

70
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,166
Sorry for the scare, kid.

71
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,083
Don't be, you were heroic!

72
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:45,000
I wonder how things have been
going for Shun and Emilio.

73
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,000
[EMILIO grunting]

74
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,458
[SHUN yells]

75
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,666
You okay?

76
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,166
[EMILIO groaning]

77
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,666
Oh no.

78
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,375
[SHUN] Look Dad, what you're
doing is clearly wrong.

79
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,458
[ASANAGA]
You're still ignorant, Shun.

80
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,250
I only sought power
because I wished

81
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,541
to build a better life
for you and your mother.

82
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:41,000
Even to this moment,
that's my only desire.

83
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:46,416
[ASANAGA] No one recognized
the value of my research.

84
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,958
It would have ended
where it began,

85
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,833
in that tiny workshop
I could barely afford.

86
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,958
Instead, I've been able
to build one of the most

87
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,625
prominent companies
in the world.

88
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,791
[SHUN]
All by stealing Warp Particles.

89
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,416
Yes, as I've explained,

90
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,000
if it weren't for that, my
work never would've gained

91
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,333
the esteem and
respect it deserved.

92
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,125
Kinda sounds like what
you really cared about

93
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,708
was getting famous!

94
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:12,750
[ASANAGA] You're wrong. I could
care less what the world thinks.

95
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:16,875
All I want is for you and
your mother to be happy.

96
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,750
Well you screwed up.

97
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,875
'Cause Mom could never be
happy with what you've done.

98
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,041
[ASANAGA gasps]
You ungrateful brat!

99
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,541
Please, listen.

100
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,208
There's nothing more
to be said. Goodbye.

[MAKIKO]
He's our little treasure. Ours.

[ASANAGA growls]

106
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,291

Let him go!

No!

[SHUN]
Dad!

111
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,958

Are you...?

112
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,333
[gasps]

113
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,875
[EMILIO]
Shun.

114
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,583
[SHUN]
It's all right.

115
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,958
Did I...?

116
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:16,333
[SHUN]
You had to. You saved my life.

117
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,666
You were injured.

118
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,875
I'm fine. How're you?

119
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,583
I'm ok.

120

[SHUN growls]

124
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,708
I can't!

125
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:49,583
[EMILIO] Then drop me.
Let go! You can live!

126
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,625
[SHUN]
I won't go back without you!

127
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,916
[EMILIO]
There's no way!

128
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,166
[SHUN]
Then we'll find one!

[EMILIO]
Huh?

134
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,708
[gasps] Over there!

135
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,708
It took you long enough.
Welcome back!

136
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,500
They pulled it off.

137
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,208
[ALICIA] So did you end up
finding Tir Na Nog, or what?

138
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,083
Uh! You're both injured.
Is it bad?

139
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,958
I barely even took a scratch.

140
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,041
But His Highness could
keel over any second.

141
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,708
You're barely conscious!

142
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,083
Chill. You'll hurt yourself.

143
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:12,958
Shut up!

00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,041

[BOTH]
Uh...

148
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,166
Hey! What's with you punks?
You've gone and made her cry.

149
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,541
I didn't mean to.

150
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,958
Yeah, I blame him.

151
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:29,083
Could ya please stop with
the fighting for a minute?

152
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,750
I'm just so grateful that both
of you made it back safe,

153
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,083
ya know?

154
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,875
[ALICIA]
You too, Falarion.

155
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,041
[PASCAL]
Good to see you, boys!

156
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,458
[SHUN] Pascal, you're all right!
I knew you'd pull through.

157
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,708
Sweet.

158
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,583
[PASCAL] Warp Particles
are back on the rise.

159
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,083
And I suspect that this
is thanks to you.

160
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,791
We couldn't have done it
if not for your help.

161
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,083
[JOSEPH]
Wow.

162
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,833
I don't feel like these devices
can be replicated, sir.

163
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,750
They're beyond complex.

164
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:07,208
We'll not see Tir Na Nog, Babel,
or the parinblue again.

165
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:10,125
You'd need Dr. Asanaga's talent
and the technology

166
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,750
of the surface to
reproduce such marvels.

167
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:16,375
And to be perfectly honest,
we don't have either.

168
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,625
Although, the more
ambitious side of me

169
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,666
would like to take
a crack at it.

170
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,375
Uh! Hm...

171
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,166
[BOTH gasp]

172
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,166
Is something wrong?

173
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,208
I think we'd better leave it be.

174
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,791
If there's one thing I've
learned from this,

175
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,166
it's that our ancestor's
warnings about the surface

176
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,666
were right.

177
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,125
And this line of work would
only bring us closer to it.

178
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:35,666
[RODNEY]
Mm.

179
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,125
That is true.

180
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,458
I think we'll be far better
off focusing our energies

181
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,166
on Warp Particle research.
The more we can discover

182
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,000
on that front, the brighter
we can make Endora's future.

183
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,541
[JOSEPH]
Agreed!

184
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:49,250
Well in that case, I suppose
I'd better let you get to it.

185
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,833
Sir?

186
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,875
Are you sure you don't want to
stay and get back into research?

187
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,416
I'm good.

188
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,458
I'd rather knead bread in my own
bakery than struggle through

189
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:59,625
some ponderous old book
any day. No thank you

190
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,125
I understand.

191
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,583
[RODNEY] You know, I wonder what
Shun's planning to do now.

[PASCAL gasps]

193
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,541
I mean he did come from Endora,
but his life was on the surface.

194
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,166
[DEMETRIO]
A fine night, isn't it?

195
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,041
Yeah.

196
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,416
I'll say.

197
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,708
It's thanks to you we can
enjoy it. So well done.

198
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,333
I only did my part to
protect the country.

199
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:25,333
Well then? Those the words
of an aspiring king?

200
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,583
I still don't know about that.

201
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,666
But regardless, I do feel
that I owe you my thanks.

202
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,000
Uh?

203
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,416
You and the Ignauts
helped me understand

204
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,541
more than I can express.

205
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:40,166
I was blind to everything but
my own rage until you taught me

206
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,333
about this country,
and its people.

207
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,041
About fighting for something
more than myself.

208
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,708
And through this, I learned
how I want to live my life.

209
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,875
So please accept my thanks.

210
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:55,416
"How to live your life."
That's a lot to know for sure.

211
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,041
At any rate, I'm
getting much closer.

212
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,041
Fair enough. But ya know,
me and the Ignauts

213
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,708
aren't the only people who
deserve a little gratitude.

[EMILIO gasps]

You're right Demetrio, I could
use some appreciation.

We finished making
dinner, so come on in.

Now we're talking!

it's been a long time since
I've enjoyed a proper meal.

223
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,458
Will there be drinks?

224

[ALICIA]
There might be,

no business drinking so much.

Yeah, sure.

Hey, Alicia.

your father saved my

So thank you both. Also...

...I know how much I've worried
you lately. I'm sorry.

I don't get it, how did
I upset her this time?

236
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,208
It takes a sensitive nature
to understand these things,

237
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,000
there's no point
explaining to you.

238

That's your way of saying
you don't know either.

[SHUN] Oh yeah?
And how do you know that?

None without sacrifice.

247
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,791
But there are two among us
deserving of a special mention:

248
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,833
Emilio and Shun.

249
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,958

[ROYAL GUARD cheers]

Their efforts have allowed
us to avert a major crisis,

but our work is not done.

Until the Kingdom of
Endora is restored,

254
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,833
it will fall to the Ignauts
to keep the peace.

255
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,916
Gradido. I ask you to use
your island as a base

256
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,541
from which to oversee the north.

257

Sure. You can leave it to me.

258

[DEMETRIO] Ralph, give your
assistance to Gradido,

259
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,666
and keep in touch with us.

260
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,625
Right. I'll follow
your lead, sir.

[DEMETRIO]
Felix, Louise.

262
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,000
You're off the hook until you're
healed from your wounds.

263
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:51,708
Thanks.

264
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,125
I'm already healed.

265
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,958
Then why do you have
those bandages on?

266
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,208
So I'm mostly healed.

267
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,625
If you force yourself to move
around before you're ready to,

268
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,375
you'll heal even slower.

269

her worry. Have a heart.

and restore the royal castle.

liked our food?

compare to the cuisine

of the surface.

Wait a sec, you really
had food on the surface?

how they cook there!

on little white mounds.

302
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:21,083
Oh, I just wanna go outside
for a bit of fresh air.

303
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,000

Something wrong?

304
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,166
Uh! Emilio.

305
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,000
That's a pretty weak
excuse you gave.

306
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:36,916
Come on. Sometimes a guy
just wants some fresh air.

307
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,666
Sometimes. Like when deciding
what he's going to do next.

308
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,333
I have decided. Y'know,
I really do like Endora.

309
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:46,500
Made a lotta friends here,
gone on some cool adventures.

310
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:51,458
But even so, I just can't stay.

311
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,583
That'd mean leaving
my mother alone.

312
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,958
I see.

is where I belong.

Yeah.

315
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,958
So what are you planning to do?

316
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:07,708
Don't know. I want to protect
Endora's people, but...

317
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,791
There are things a lot of things
I'd like to do before that.

318

Well you sound resolute.

00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,791
[EMILIO]
Oh, you're one to talk!

322
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,708
Uh! I make decisions without
thinkin' twice, dude!

323
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,250
That's precisely my point!

324
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,541
[BOTH laugh]

325
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,291
[EMILIO] I don't suppose I'll
be seeing you for a while.

326
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,500
[SHUN]
Yeah. Guess not.

327
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,791
[EMILIO] Do you think you'll
talk about Endora?

328
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,625
[SHUN]
Prob'ly a bad idea.

329
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:40,166
I mean most people would just
think I was crazy or a liar.

330
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,083
Plus, if I did tell,

331
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,250
I'd have to mention my
super crabby companion,

332
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,875
and I still don't know if
I should refer to you

333
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,375
as Prince Priss, or the
man who became king.

334
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,000
I hate you.

335
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,416
[SHUN]
Whelp. I'm headin' out.

336
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,708
[gasps] But you haven't said
goodbye to the others.

337
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,750
Yeah I'm pretty bad
at that sorta thing.

338
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,291
Do me a favor and tell Demetrio

339
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,708
I'm sorry I didn't
help out, will ya?

340
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:04,958
Yeah, sure.

341
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,416
We went through hell and
back, but to be honest,

342
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,041
I don't think I could've asked
for a better adventure.

343
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,875
That adventure would've
failed if it weren't for you.

344
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:16,125
'Bout time I got some respect.

345
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,708
Well, Shun...

346
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,708
Uh?

347
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,083
Till next time.

348
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,500
Yeah.

349
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,041
[gasps] Be careful!

350
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,791
Give Alicia a kiss for me, kay?

351
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,083
[gasps]

352
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,458
[SHUN]
As far back as I can remember,

353
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,958
whenever I saw a crystal,

354
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,791
I'd imagine there was an
unseen world trapped within.

355
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:37,125
And if I stared at it for long
enough, it'd be taken there.

356
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,041
Funny...

357
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,958
That fantasy turned
into the truth.

358
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,166
[SHUN] A gorgeous world,
painted in the light of Adamas.

359
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,875
Endora.

360
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,250
Right now, and for
the rest of time,

361
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,875
it burns as brightly as the
memories in my heart.
