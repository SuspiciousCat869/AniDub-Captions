[SHUN]
Hey.

2
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:12,375
Where are you takin' us, anyway?

3
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:13,666
Hello?

4
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:16,125
Look, man.

5
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,625
I think I deserve some
friggin' answers already.

6
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:19,958
Like if you're
actually a prince,

7
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:23,375
then what were you doing
locked up in that dungeon?

8
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,958
Hey, "Your Highness,"
I'm tryin' to talk to you.

9
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,458
You sure you're a prince?

10
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,791
Ya look more like a
wannabe rockstar--

11
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:29,625
Shut up.

12
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:30,916
What the hell, man?

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,875
I broke you out of prison;
you owe me big time!

14
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,791
I could have escaped
on my own with ease.

15
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,333
[SHUN]
Oh really?

16
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:39,500
Do I need to remind you that
you owe me your obnoxious life?

17
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,291
You would've drowned
if not for me.

18
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,583
You pompous little--

19
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,125
[FALARION growls]

20
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,458
[SHUN yells]

21
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:48,250
Could we please stop with
all the bickering, boys?

22
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,500
You scare easy.

23
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,125
Just because a guy gets
taken by surprise

24
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,333
doesn't mean he's scared, okay?

25
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,791
Well, since I've
got your attention,

26
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,458
would you answer
my question already?

27
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,916
[EMILIO]
It'll be dawn soon.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,916
We should move on. Quietly.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,375
[SHUN growls]

30
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:02,875
Hey! I'm not done with you!

31
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:04,625
Come back here!

32
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:07,291
Look, I'm not shuttin' up
until you start talkin'!

33
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,625
Hey!

34
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:17,875
The day begins.

35
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,958
[SHUN]
The sun?

36
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:30,208
[SHUN]
I can feel it pulling me in.

37
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:33,083
No. It's too late.

38
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,750
I'm already in.

39
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,250
[SHUN]
Sure enough, no signal.

40
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,958
Now it's just a
crummy flashlight.

41
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,791
[EMILIO]
Hey, dimwit, we're leaving.

42
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,333
With or without you.

43
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,833
[SHUN] It's like everything you
say is meant to piss me off!

44
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,666
Believe it or not,
I've got a real name.

45
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,333
It's Shun Asanaga! Use it!

46
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,625
A pleasure.
I'm Emilio Langheim.

47
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,916
That... was weirdly polite.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,875
You can call me Alicia, and this
little guy's named Falarion.

49
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,041
[FALARION squeaks]

50
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,833
That means he's
pleased to meet you.

51
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,500
Yeah? Likewise.

52
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,166
So... I have to ask.

53
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,041
Did you really come
from the surface?

54
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,041
Well--

55
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:40,916
[ALICIA]
But how did you get here?

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,083
Did the surface people send you?

57
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,291
Why you, though?

58
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,750
Will you please stop
with the interrogation?

59
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,750
Aw. Now you're the one who
won't answer any questions.

60
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,125
Sorry to disappoint you,

61
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,250
but I have literally no idea
what's happening here.

62
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,666
[EMILIO]
Hey. You.

63
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,500
We're leaving. And don't make
me repeat myself again.

64
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:56,500
[SHUN]
My name's Shun!

65
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,500
[EMILIO]
This way.

66
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,000
[SHUN]
What the heck is that way?

67
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,666
I can answer questions later.

68
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,583
For now, though,
we need to hide.

69
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,666
[SHUN] Could you at least tell
me where we're gonna hide?

70
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,750
Course not.

71
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,833
[ARMY CAPTAIN 2A] My men have
scoured the entire castle,

72
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,583
but they were unable
to locate the prince.

73
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,583
He's escaped, then.

74
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,000
Send forth a search party.

75
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,250
[ARMY CAPTAIN 2A]
My Lord...

76
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,916
I understand that
somebody aided the prince

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,250
in his escape.

78
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,958
A young man who
possesses a Warp Relic.

79
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,791
Find out all you can about him.

80
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,125
[ARMY CAPTAIN 2A]
As you command.

81
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,458
You say Emilio and his
accomplice fell into the river,

82
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:38,625
is that correct?

83
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:39,875
[GUIDORO]
Yes sir.

00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,458
Decided that's all he
needs to know, did ya?

85
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,958
Be quiet.

86
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,541
The boy's determined.

87
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,416
I doubt he would die so easily.

88
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,666
He has but one
place left to run.

89
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,875
We'll have him soon.

90

We're close now.

91
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,541
Right.

92
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,708
Don't suppose you'd like to
tell me what we're close to?

93
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,125
Or is walking and talking
too hard to do at once?

94
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,000
I think we're
heading to Pascal's place.

95
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,333
Yeah? Who's that?

96
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,916
Well, he used to be in
charge of all the research

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,500
back at the castle.

98
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,500
But on top of that, he was
Emilio's childhood tutor.

I've missed you!

So tall! Either you've gained
inches or I'm shrinking

I don't mean to spoil

but we could really use a hand
getting down from this thing!

You know that fella up there?

128

Doesn't look familiar.

What are you doing up there?

133
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,666
So it was you who
built these traps, right?

134
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,625
It was!

135
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:20,916
Well, probably.

136
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,208
What's that supposed to mean?

Look, I can't keep
track of everything I make.

Well you haven't changed a bit.

Please tell me
if I'm wrong here,

but it sounds like you could've
booby-trapped the whole forest

and we'd only find out
by walking on one!

Good.

143

to avoid my famous spike pits!

figured it out, but thanks.

who you are.

Oh.

149
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,125
I see you have a Warp Relic.

150
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,750
I didn't think that
people from the surface

151
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,875
could actually use Warp Relics.

to get a feel for this thing.

00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:28,750
Hey, moron.

165
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:29,958
It's not yours. Don't touch it.

166
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,708
[SHUN] It's not yours either,
so bite me!

167
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,000
[PASCAL laughs]

168
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,208
Haven't had meat
like this in ages!

169
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,666
Hey...

170
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,041
You've been taking care
of yourself, right?

171
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,958
Don't tell me that you still
get so lost in your work

172
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,208
that you forget to eat
and faint like you used to.

173
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,500
There's no need
to fret about me.

174
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,208
I can fill up for a week
off a meal like this.

175
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,791
[PASCAL] So... That kid is
really from the surface?

176
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:52,666
Well, yeah.

177
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,208
That's what Emilio told me.

178
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,833
[PASCAL]
And yet he has a Warp Relic.

179
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:56,791
Weird, right?

180
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,125
I don't get it either.

181
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,791
For that matter,
how'd he even get down here?

182
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,458
[EMILIO] I told you not
to touch anything.

183
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,833
Yeah, well what about that thing
you're touchin' with your butt?

184
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,500
[EMILIO]
This is called a stool.

185
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,125
You know what?
I'll make you a deal!

186
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,875
If you shut your
stupid trap right now,

187
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,583
I will stop touching
things happily!

188
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,666
What I'm telling you
is basic etiquette!

189
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,000
Are you all this rude
on the surface,

190
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,333
or is that why
they sent you down?

191
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,333
[SHUN]
Excuse me?

192
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,500
Who do you think you are, man?

193
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,958
You can't leave them
alone for a minute.

194
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,958
I think they're
getting along just fine.

195
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,750
Then I'd hate
to see 'em fight.

196
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,750
[PASCAL]
Wow!

197
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,666
It looks delicious!

198
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,958
[ALICIA] The fresher the meat,
the better the meal!

199
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,458
And this meat couldn't be
fresher unless we ate it alive.

200
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,791
Uh... You don't mean those
things that attacked us...

201
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,333
There's a whole lot more
where that came from,

202
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,000
so eat as much as you like!

203
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:58,833
[ALICIA]
Here you go!

204
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,750
Endora frogs, guts and all!

205
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,166
So good I just
grill 'em as they come!

206
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,250
[SHUN]
Ugh...

207
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,875
It must be in
a great deal of pain.

208
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:10,458
Eat it.

209
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,458
[SHUN yells]

210
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,791
[EMILIO laughs]

211
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,625
Wow. After all that talk
about my manners...

212
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,250
[EMILIO laughs]

213
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,416
[ALICIA]
Here! For you.

214
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,833
[PASCAL]
So good! Mmm!

215
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,791
Rancid.

216
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,000
[EMILIO] If you don't like it,
then you don't have to eat it.

217
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,166
[SHUN] Oh, I'll eat it all,
just watch me!

218
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,416
I knew it'd be bad, but wow.

219
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,958
[PASCAL]
So, Shun.

220
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,041
About your journey here
from the surface...

221
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,250
[SHUN]
Yeah?

222
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,833
Well, I was wondering
just how you did it.

223
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,458
I was looking for
my dad in his office.

224
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:58,250
I found this crystal.
And I picked it up.

225
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,916
Before I knew what was
happening, I was here.

226
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,625
[PASCAL] And you believe
the crystal is responsible?

227
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,791
I think I can say
that much for sure.

228
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,916
I could feel its pull.

229
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,583
Now, suddenly, I can make
a sword out of nowhere.

230
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,750
I've seen.

231
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,250
There's no doubt
it's a Warp Relic.

232
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,416
[SHUN]
Question.

233
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,458
What'll it take for me
to get back home?

234
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,958
[PASCAL]
Hmm...

235
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,750
You've gotta know about
something I can try,

236
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,333
or anything useful?

237
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,416
Prince Priss over here couldn't
be bothered to answer me.

238
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,083
I haven't even figured out
what the heck this place is yet!

239
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,583
Well, if that's the case,

240
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,416
then I suppose I should
start explaining from there.

241
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,125
[SHUN]
What's that?

242
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,125
This is a cross-section
map of our planet.

243
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,791
We are here in
the land of Endora.

244
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,208
Beneath your surface.

245
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,833
[SHUN]
We're underground?

246
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,333
But at school they said
it was all lava down here.

247
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,541
If it's hollow...

248
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,333
It feels like I've
been living on a shell.

249
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,375
[PASCAL] This beauty here
is called Adamas.

250
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,208
Your sun brings
light to the surface.

251
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,875
Adamas does the same
thing for us beneath it.

252
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,416
So then it pretty
much is your sun, huh?

253
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,166
Although...

254
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,791
The real sun is nowhere
even close to that beautiful.

255
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,708
[PASCAL] Are you
familiar with this place?

256
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:12,541
[SHUN]
Uh...

257
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:13,791
It's the North Pole, right?

258
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,166
[PASCAL]
Yes, good.

259
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,916
Your sun's light enters
our world through here.

260
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Adamas magnifies that light, and
scatters it throughout the land.

261
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,208
You might think that Adamas'
light would disappear

262
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,291
come nightfall,
but it doesn't.

263
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,958
Adamas magnifies and
redirects most light,

264
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,833
but it also captures some.

265
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,791
Overnight, that
captive light escapes,

266
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,708
producing a glow not
unlike that of your moon.

267
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,125
So if you've got a sun and
moon, then what about stars?

268
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,625
No, the only light in
our sky comes from Adamas.

269
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,458
Its moon form sees no phases.

270
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:45,125
We experience no
change in seasons here.

271
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,791
I never would've guessed it.

272
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,291
A whole other world
hidden right under mine.

273
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,041
I understand that
whoever created Endora

274
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,500
went to an awful lot of trouble

275
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,750
to keep you
surface dwellers out.

276
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,083
[SHUN]
Oh yeah?

277
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,125
Think of religion.

278
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,666
The underworld is always hell.

279
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,291
[PASCAL] That myth
was spread for a reason.

280
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,583
By popularizing the idea
that the underworld

281
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,000
is a place of torment,

282
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,125
our ancestors meant to
dissuade you surface dwellers

283
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,416
from seeking us out.

284
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,125
Or so I've been told, anyway.

285
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,250
Wait, though...

286
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,458
If Endora's cut off
from the surface,

287
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,958
why do all of you
still know about it?

288
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,458
Now Endora's founder
did conceal its location

289
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,791
from the surface, but there
was still a fairly decent bit

290
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,541
of contact between the realms
for some length of time.

291
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,208
I'm afraid they put
the nail in that coffin

292
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,250
a while back, though.

293
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,750
[SHUN]
A book on the whole earth?

294
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,375
It was written on the surface.

295
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,041
I borrowed it from the royal
library on the day I left.

296
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,125
I intend to bring
it back someday.

297
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,000
Almost everything I
know about the surface

298
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,833
I learned from these pages.

299
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:42,041
Obviously, I've never been
able to see it for myself.

300
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,125
[SHUN]
Huh.

301
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:46,666
If that publishing date's right,

302
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,083
then this book isn't
much older than me!

303
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,541
So then this proves that Endora
had at least some contact

304
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,000
with the surface within
the past few decades!

305
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,041
[PASCAL]
It does.

306
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,666
How did people
go between worlds?

307
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,083
The only connection
between Endora and the surface

308
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,833
was a city known as Babylon.

309
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,416
Babylon? I know that city.

310
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,625
It was in my history books.

311
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,125
But you're saying that
Endora had a Babylon as well?

312
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,041
Yeah, and somewhere
in it, you'd find Babel,

313
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,500
the only device ever
created capable of making

314
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,416
an ascent to the surface.

315
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,250
But Babylon was struck by
some sort of catastrophe,

316
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,375
and Babel was demolished.

317
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,208
Since then, our worlds
have grown close but divided,

318
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,375
intersecting only
on the rarest occasions.

319
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:31,166
But King Delzaine
plans to change that soon.

320
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,208
He's put a great deal
of time and resources

321
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,750
into building Babel anew.

322
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,583
So what happened,
has he finished it?

323
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,666
Well, uh...

324
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,208
It was actually about
to be completed,

325
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,916
but he ran into
a little problem.

326
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,375
All I'm hearin' is
that Babel isn't ready.

327
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,708
'Fraid not. Apologies, kid.

328
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,166
[PASCAL] I'm sure he'll get
it sorted out eventually.

329
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,958
[SHUN] But I shouldn't
hold my breath, right?

330
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,125
[PASCAL]
Anyway...

331
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,500
You wouldn't mind if
I took another peek

332
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,083
at that Warp Relic, would you?

333
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,583
Uh... Do you mean like,
here and now?

334
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,750
[PASCAL]
Yep.

335
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,625
The thing is, I can only
seem to summon it

336
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,333
if I'm in some kind of pinch.

337
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:05,125
I bet Falarion
could help with that.

338
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,625
Yeah, thanks, but I'm good.

339
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,458
I should try this on my own.

340
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,708
[SHUN]
I did it!

341
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,333
It's magnificent!

342
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,250
I present to you: Excalibur!

343
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:20,833
What was that?

344
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:21,666
Uh, nothing!

345
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,083
Forget it happened, please.

346
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,750
[SHUN] So... Do
you wanna hold it, or--?

347
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,958
[PASCAL] No, I'm good!
I just wanted a peek.

348
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:27,541
[SHUN]
But you--!

349
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,458
[PASCAL]
Thanks!

350
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,375
Feel free to put it away now.

351
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,416
[SHUN]
'Kay, if you're sure, man.

352
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,041
[EMILIO]
Strange...

353
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,791
His skill with a Warp Relic's
improved greatly.

354
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,708
And in such a short time.

355
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:44,250
[SHUN] Why don't'cha
show me yours now, Pascal?

356
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,541
I appreciate your interest,

357
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,291
but I can't show
what I don't have.

358
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,666
[SHUN]
What?

359
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,000
The power to create a
Warp Relic isn't universal,

360
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,750
even amongst us Endras. The gift
is granted largely at random.

361
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,708
To the best of my knowledge,
things like genetics,

362
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,583
strength, and intelligence
don't even factor into it.

363
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,375
It boils down to
an invisible coin toss.

364
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,958
Some of us won it,
and some of us lost.

365
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,541
In case this isn't clear yet,
I lost that particular toss.

366
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,833
Wow, tough break.

367
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,458
I feel as if everyone
I've met down here

368
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,375
has a Warp Relic
except for you.

369
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,833
Mercy.
Stop rubbing it in, please.

370
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,166
Don't worry 'bout it.

371
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,250
Alicia doesn't have one,
and she gets by.

372
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,291
Huh?

373
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,666
Oh no, I've got mine
on my shoulder.

374
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,500
Give him a big
battle roar, 'kay?

375
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,750
[FALARION squeaks]

376
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,125
No way!

377
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,583
You're tellin' me that
your Warp Relic is alive?

378
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,500
[ALICIA]
Sure!

379
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,125
[PASCAL]
Allow me to explain.

380
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,000
Warp Relics can
take on many forms,

381
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,833
and are comprised of what
we refer to as Warp Particles.

382
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,333
[SHUN]
What's a Warp Particle?

383
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,750
It's a very special type
of energy that I believe

384
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,875
is unique to Endora.

385
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,000
These particles have
the lifelike ability

386
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,083
to self-replicate, dividing
in half not unlike an amoeba,

387
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,791
but without the need to eat.

388
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,958
They can't exist on the surface,
but multiply steadily here,

389
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,291
charging our air
with their presence.

390
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,000
[PASCAL] A Warp Relic is simply
a host of Warp Particles,

391
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,083
given form by your mind.

392
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,875
Honestly, I'm not quite
sure I followed all that.

393
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,166
I did catch that king
what's-his-face is almost done

394
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,000
makin' my ride home in Babylon.

395
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,916
So... I think I'm
headin' that way.

396
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,583
[ALICIA] Look, you say that
like it's gonna be this simple,

397
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,041
easy thing, but it's not.

398
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,500
Maybe you don't realize
how far we are from Babylon.

399
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,583
The distance doesn't matter,

400
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:21,416
because my mom and dad
must be worried sick about me.

401
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,458
[ALICIA] I understand where
you're coming from, but think,

402
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,833
what's the point
of getting to Babel

403
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,625
if it doesn't even work yet?

404
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,333
You said that it was really
close to being finished,

405
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,166
though, right?

406
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,333
Uh... I... I did.

407
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,708
Then I'll make my way to
Babylon now, and wait there!

408
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,625
That way, when they
open Babel for business,

409
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,541
I'll be the first guy in line!

410
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,625
[EMILIO]
Shun. You may prove useful.

411
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,083
Geez.

412
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,125
You act like you hear me,
but  you ignore what I say.

413
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,166
Hey, Emilio,
help me criticize him--

414
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,916
Am I really this ignorable?

415
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,083
[EMILIO]
What's that?

416
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,250
Shun's decided he's
walking to Babylon,

417
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,250
and I need you to
help change his mind!

418
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,791
Let him be.

419
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,833
Shun has every right to run off
and pick a ditch to die in.

420
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,958
Are you good at anything
except pissing me off?

421
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,583
Better question, do you have
any idea where Babylon is?

422
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,583
[SHUN]
Of course I don't!

423
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,250
[EMILIO]
Then find a ditch.

424
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,791
It's finally done.

425
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,458
[PASCAL]
Yes.

426
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,875
But is this really what we want?

427
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,208
[PASCAL]
Your Majesty.

428
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,416
Please forgive my insolence.

429
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,875
But I feel that
renewing contact

430
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:23,250
between Endora and the surface
would be a dire mistake!

431
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,791
Our ancestors,
in their wisdom,

432
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,416
taught us that Endora must be
kept permanently concealed

433
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,666
from the world above.

434
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,791
This system is in place
to protect not just--

435
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:40,666
If only you had
listened, your grace.

436
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,625
By this point, I suppose
they must've found me out.

437
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,000
[CASTINA]
Welcome, Your Majesty.

438
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,458
Have you come to observe
our progress for yourself?

439
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:48,208
I am honored.

440
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,666
[DELZAINE]
Begin.

441
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,666
[CASTINA] The good news is
I have found the problem.

442
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,375
It lies with this circuit here.

443
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,958
Once I can resolve the
issue or replace the circuit,

444
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,541
Babel will be able
to resume operations.

445
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,791
Is there something else?

446
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,083
The fact of the matter
is I find it a bit odd

447
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:06,125
for such a flaw to be present
at all, and to be frank,

448
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,000
I find it difficult
to imagine that Pascal

449
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,458
would have failed
to observe it himself.

450
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,333
I suggest you
hasten your efforts.

451
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,208
[CASTINA]
I shall do that, sir.

452
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,958
I'll work as
swiftly as I'm able.

453
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,458
[DELZAINE] Seems you've
turned against us, Pascal.

454
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,083
So be it.

455
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,000
The time has come at last.

456
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,083
[FALARION squeaks]

457
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,416
What's up, lil' bud?
You hear something?

458
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,708
[rattling]

459
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,000
The alarm!

460
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,125
[PASCAL]
Oh, that's bad.

461
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,041
Looks like the Royal Guard!

462
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,416
They're after us!

463
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,958
[PASCAL]
Put that up!

464
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,375
They've got horses,
hounds, armor, and manpower!

465
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,833
We're gonna have to run!

466
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,208
Full throttle!

467
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,791
[SOLDIERS]
Huh?

468
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,958
Catch ya on the flipside, boys!

469
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,958
[ALICIA] How did you find
time to make this thing?

470
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,375
I knew this day would come
eventually, so I prepared.

471
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,375
[SHUN]
Way cool...

472
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,541
[ALICIA]
What do you mean by that?

473
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,500
The only reason Babel
isn't complete yet

474
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,166
is because I kept
something secret

475
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,250
to slow down their progress.

476
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,708
Though I always knew
they'd work it out

477
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:38,666
sooner or later.

478
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,041
Wait, so if you know the secret,

479
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,875
that means you could finish
it yourself, doesn't it?

480
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,125
If I were ever so inclined,
of course I could.

481
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,250
Yeah! All right!

482
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,375
Oh, I'm pretty sure that
Emilio's the reason those guards

483
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,375
were after us, anyway.

484
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,958
Shut up.

485
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,541
[SHUN] He recently busted his
way out of the castle's dungeon!

486
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,583
Well at any rate...

487
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,541
We can catch up on
all that once we've landed.

488
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,625
[ALICIA]
Where are we headed?

489
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,125
I call it Hiding Spot #1.

490
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,500
No way, we've got a
jet! Let's go to Babylon!

491
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,083
[PASCAL] Stop it boy,
you'll doom us all!

492
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,083
[ALICIA]
Stop it, Shun!

493
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,666
[SHUN]
Gimme the wheel, old man!

494
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,000
[EMILIO]
Shut up!

495
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,208
[SHUN] By the way,
which way is Babylon?

496
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,958
[EMILIO]
