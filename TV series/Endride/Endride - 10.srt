they could for us.

It wouldn't be safe for them

[DEMETRIO] Those dragons took

It seems weird we haven't
seen any sign of Delzaine.

Do ya think he might've
beat us getting there?

It's hard to say.

He was traveling
straight from the castle,

so he took a different route.

I'm worried that if
he did get there first,

25
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,625
he could do something
to screw up Babel.

If it used to be broken, it
might just be good for one ride.

[EMILIO] Shun's needs aside,
keeping the king

a feeling of dread.

can't we do something?

00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,708
I get the feeling this
isn't what you came here

162
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:09,833
to talk about.

163
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,083
Right, thank you!

164
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,625
I wanted to inform you
that the lab's regional

165
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,541
Warp Particle measurements have
been completed and analyzed.

166
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,583
I still can't fathom why the
chief was so reluctant

167
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,875
to continue research on such
an important phenomenon,

168
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,541
but I'm glad we
ended up doing it.

169
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,375
I agree. The diminishment of
Endora's Warp Particles

170
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,625
is an extremely
important discovery.

171
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,625
Your powers of observation
must be well honed indeed.

172
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,166
Ah! I can't express what it
means to receive such praise

173
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,541
from Pascal himself!

174
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,250
Although I must say that
I never could have noticed

175
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,333
that Warp Particles were
dying out if not for the device

176
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,958
you created to detect them!

177
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,500
Once I'd gathered
sufficient data,

178
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:41,875
I had a flash of insight!

179
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,000
[PASCAL] Warp Particles
are a vital part of Endora.

180
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,166
If they continue to
deplete at this rate,

181
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,833
our entire world will
doubtlessly suffer.

182
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,375
[SHUN] Things are startin'
to get out of hand here.

183
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,083
All of this doomsday talk,

184
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,916
and with the king
so close to Babel...

185
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I wonder...

186
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,083
Am I really gonna
make it back home?

187
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,541
[EMILIO]
You will. I'll make sure of it.

188
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,833
These problems don't affect you.

189
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,458
They belong to Endora.

190
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,958
You have troubles
enough without adding

191
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,583
any of ours to the list.

192
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,375
Wait, are you being serious?

193
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,416
Go to sleep.

194
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,958
Uh, okay.

195
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,500
[SHUN] He might've just
said that to shut me up.

196
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,250
I'm sure he's got his
own problems in mind.

197
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,625
I mean, he was raised by
the man who killed his father.

198
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,083
Anyone would be
torn up after that.

199
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,291
Hey, listen.

200
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,625
You might be a piece of work,

201
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,750
but you've also had
my back through this.

202
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,000
No matter what you
decide to do, I'm with you.

203
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,000
You can count on me
to make good on our deal.

204
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,666
But... Killing Delzaine
to take revenge

205
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,125
isn't gonna make
anything better.

206
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,208
Isn't there another option?

207
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,291
[SHUN]
Hey. You asleep?

208
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,875
[EMILIO] You don't understand.
How could you?

209
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:16,875
Do your worst.
Never make it past me.

210
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,958
What do you think?

211
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:24,541
How do I stop Emilio from
going through with this?

212
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,416
[LOUISE]
Up and at 'em.

213
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,958
The rest of the watch is yours.

214
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:27,958
[ELJUIA]
Right.

215
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,375
Hey there.
Why are you still awake?

216
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,750
[ALICIA]
No reason.

217
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,541
Well, we're getting a
pretty early start tomorrow,

218
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,875
so as long you're up to nothing,

219
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,916
you might try and
do it lying down.

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,958
Right, I'll give that a try.

221
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,750
What's on your mind?

222
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,500
[ALICIA]
Nothing. Good night, Louise.

223
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,875
[SHUN yawns]

224
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,625
He's up early.

225
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:19,875
[EMILIO]
Seriously?

226
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:20,833
[DEMETRIO] You couldn't
have done better, Ralph.

227
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,375
[RALPH]
Thanks.

228
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,833
It looks like this revolution
might really have a chance.

229
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,625
[DEMETRIO] Yup. The tides
are turning in our favor.

230
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,333
We've become a force
to be reckoned with,

231
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,500
even for the king.

232
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,083
About time you woke up.

233
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,416
Whatever. So who's this?

234
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,833
Don't you remember me?

235
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,083
[SHUN]
Uh...

236
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,166
Surely the two of you
must have met back at

237
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,875
the Ignauts' old encampment.

238
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,958
Ralph's one of the soldiers
I sent off after the attack.

239
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,333
Uh... Oh yeah!

240
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,250
I thought you
looked kinda familiar!

241
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,583
You remembered!

242
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,708
No worries. I was just
another face in the crowd.

243
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,458
[DEMETRIO] When we left
to court the Zoozians,

244
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,958
other Ignauts like Ralph
did the same elsewhere.

245
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,250
The goal was to obtain
the support of as many lords

246
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,583
as they could sway.

247
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:58,833
[RALPH]
That's right.

248
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,541
We focused on areas
far enough away

249
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,458
that fear of retaliation
wouldn't be much of a concern.

250
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,625
And I guess it paid off,

251
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,166
because most of the
lords we spoke with

252
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,083
offered their support
to the cause.

253
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,125
You don't say?

254
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,666
So by "support" you mean...

255
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,458
Full alliances across the board.

256
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,458
Council, supplies, and
a slew of additional soldiers.

257
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,875
That's amazing!

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,291
I should on my way, then.

259
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,750
There are still plenty
of lords out there

260
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,541
I haven't gotten
to speak with yet.

261
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,791
[DEMETRIO]
Fair enough. Go get 'em!

262
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,458
And if negotiations
with the king

263
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,000
do somehow go south,

264
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,250
get word to us as
quickly as you can.

265
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,750
Your men will come.

266
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,125
I appreciate it.

267
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,583
But for now, let's just hope
it doesn't come to that.

268
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,125
Right. Best of luck, sir.

269
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,125
It's about to get
busy around here.

270
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:46,666
First the Zoozians
and now these nobles.

271
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,000
We finally have
the power to do this.

272
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,208
Guess we do.

273
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,416
[LOUISE] Shake it off.
It's how life works.

274
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,833
What's right for one
is pain for another.

275
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,708
[DEMETRIO]
Louise?

276
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:17,750
[LOUISE gasps]

277
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,458
Goodness.
What's with the mean mug?

278
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,750
It's nothing.
I was just surprised.

279
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:30,791
Aww, c'mon.

280
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,041
If you've got a problem,
let it out.

281
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,500
[LOUISE] I was thinking about
what Eljuia said, okay?

282
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,791
Just lay off.

283
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,541
Yeah, that's been weighing
on my mind as well.

284
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,208
By the way,
we just received word

285
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,291
from one of our more
itinerant comrades.

286
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,166
Apparently, they've
been gathering support

287
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,583
from sundry lords
across the land.

288
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,083
I'm so sorry.

289
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,458
[ALICIA]
Emilio! Shun!

290
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:55,916
[SHUN]
Hey. Good mornin'.

291
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,666
[EMILIO]
What is it?

292
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,041
Did you hear?

293
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,125
The Ignauts who split up
were out looking for allies,

294
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,375
and now a bunch of lords
have joined our side!

295
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,208
Oh yeah, I already knew that.

296
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,416
[chuckles]

297
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,750
Yay, you.

298
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,416
Yup, I was one of a select
few who got to hear it

299
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,583
from the messenger.

300
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,208
His name's Ralph.
We go way back.

301
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,625
You would've liked him if you
hadn't been busy sleepin' in.

302
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,791
Please, you didn't even
know the man's name.

303
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,750
And the only reason you
stumbled into consciousness

304
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,458
is because we spoke
beside the tent.

305
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,291
Look. It was on
the tip of my tongue!

306
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,333
Like that gross strand
of drool you woke up with?

307
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,625
What? You're kiddin' me!

308
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:25,750
I am.

309
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,291
Uh... You little...

310
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,416
[chuckles nervously]

311
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,958
You two are the same as ever.

312
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,041
I still can't figure out
if you get along.

313
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,333
No one cares if you look
like a slack-jawed imbecile

314
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,708
when you first wake up.
It's fine.

315
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,000
I care! Now take it back!

316
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,500
Tell me I'm handsome
all day long!

317
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,416
You know it's true!
You're just jealous!

318
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,583
Moving on to a
subject that matters...

319
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,958
Between the Ignauts,
Zoozians, and lords,

320
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:50,166
we've gathered a force
Delzaine must recognize.

321
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,500
If all goes well, then...

322
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,625
Emilio.

323
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,666
So, uh, I guess you
are still planning

324
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,375
to kill the king, aren't you?

325
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,500
My father is dead.

326
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,833
Vengeance is all I can give him.

327
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,375
I've thought about
this for too many years

328
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,625
to betray him now.

329
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,041
[SHUN]
But why kill him?

330
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,458
Someone must!

331
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,458
And no one else seems
to care if my father's spirit

332
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,166
can rest in peace.

333
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,166
I've given everything for this.

334
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,833
Even my place as a prince.

335
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:16,875
No way.

336
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,791
You really think
you know everything?

337
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,208
Shut up!

338
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,000
I know far more than--
This has nothing to do with you.

339
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,125
[SHUN]
Oh yeah?

340
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,125
And when did that
get decided for me?

341
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,000
[EMILIO] Since you were
an outsider with no stake

342
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,333
in this world!

343
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,833
You're leaving.

344
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,208
Remember?

345
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,791
When you do,
you'll forget about this!

346
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,125
You dumb piece of--

347
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,041
Hey, let him down, Shun!

348
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,208
Has it ever crossed your mind
that people worry about you?

349
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,250
You have to let go
of this hatred.

350
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,458
If you don't, you're
gonna end up like Falarion!

351
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,833
Like Alicia's dad!

352
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,708
I've promised to
see this thing through

353
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,291
to the end with you,

354
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,625
and I don't wanna see you get
trapped inside of a Warp Relic!

355
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,375
Are you really okay
with that happening?

356
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,750
With losing who you are?

357
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,416
I'm not. I won't let it happen.

358
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,041
And what makes you
so sure about that?

359
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,583
That's enough! Let me go!

360
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,750
Idiot!

361
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,916
--Stop it!
--[SHUN growls]

362
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,416
You say your problems
don't concern me.

363
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,666
You're wrong.

364
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,208
I've never thought like that.

365
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,083
Not once since I got here.

366
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,500
Shun!

367
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:44,166
[EMILIO] I've come too far.
I'm not quitting now.

368
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,625
Emilio...

369
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,541
Thought so.

370
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,291
This data is quite conclusive.

371
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,500
Warp Particles are
steadily falling in numbers

372
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,791
in every region of Endora.

373
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,416
The results are even
worse than I hypothesized.

374
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,375
And I've still no clue
what caused this!

375
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,041
[PASCAL] If the Warp Particle
count drops too much further,

376
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,875
it won't just be
life that suffers.

377
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,250
The very structure of
Endora could collapse.

378
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,291
[gasps]

379
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,458
[JOSEPH] There's not too much to
see with those measurements.

380
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,000
We took them back
when concentrations

381
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,666
were still normal.

382
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,166
I'm missing something, aren't I?

383
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,416
Perhaps.

384
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,125
I can't help but notice
that the particle count

385
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,708
was perfectly normal
right up until King Delzaine

386
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:27,833
took the throne.

387
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,333
Whoa, that's right!

388
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,916
Are the dwindling Particles
and the King's rise related?

389
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,291
Although it's possible that this
could be a mere coincidence.

390
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,416
No way.

391
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,916
Correlation might
not show causation,

392
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,541
but I refuse to believe that it
means absolutely nothing.

393
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,208
Not when the vibrations
of a fish swimming

394
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,291
have been shown to impact
the photosynthesis of algae.

395
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,041
[PASCAL] Only one man
understands the events

396
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,791
surrounding Delzaine's
crowning: Delzaine himself.

397
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,125
[JOSEPH] ...is actually
quite likely to be of use.

398
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:54,333
[PASCAL] It would seem that the
answers I seek lie in Babylon.

399
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,958
But can I get there in time?

400
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,083
[JOSEPH chuckles]

401
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,833
[PASCAL] You've got
quite the lab here, boy.

402
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,250
Color me impressed.

403
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,500
[JOSEPH]
Why, thank you.

404
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,250
It was no simple feat
relocating all of these

405
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,708
heavy instruments.

406
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,416
But I had a hunch that
the chief and Delzaine

407
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,125
were starting to take
their research to a place

408
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:22,125
I wouldn't want to follow,
so the move was needed.

409
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,708
I still work at
the lab, mind you,

410
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:27,750
but I've taken to doing all of
my personal research over here.

411
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,291
It is our mandate as scientists
to distance ourselves

412
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,875
from any sort of
political authority,

413
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,708
so that we are free
in our pursuit of pure,

414
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,083
authentic truths.

415
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,458
I learned that
from your example!

416
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,041
You have my assurance.

417
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,041
This bad boy is the fastest way
to Babel that a man can find.

418
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:45,875
[JOSEPH]
The chief has no earthly idea

419
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,291
I've been building this thing.

420
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,083
Sometimes we scientists
have to be sneaky.

421
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,583
We'd best get going.

422
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,750
King Delzaine and the chief
could be walking into Babel

423
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,250
as we speak.

424
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,416
It is time.

425
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,750
Open the gate to the surface!

426
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:28,333
[EMILIO]
Shun.

427
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,375
What do you want?

428
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,500
[EMILIO] I may have
said too much before.

429
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,125
Wait, what?

430
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:37,125
Oh, well...
sorry for hitting you.

431
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,833
But that doesn't mean
I've changed my mind.

432
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,291
I'll have my vengeance.

433
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,583
You're still on that?

434
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,041
[DEMETRIO]
Hey, take a look!

435
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,083
There's Babylon.

436
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:57,083
I'm here. We made it.

437
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,000
And none too soon.

438
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:47,041
