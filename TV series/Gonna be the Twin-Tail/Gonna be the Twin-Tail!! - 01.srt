I am so pleased to have
each and every one of you

00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,916
as a classmate and
I can't wait to meet you all

and get to know you better.

It's a special day. A day
I hope you will remember

twin-tails here,

I don't even know what to do!

11
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:32,000
First, there's that older girl.
Simple, but very cute.

12
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,791
I'll call her
"Strawberry Twin"!

13

Well, no, not her.

Nnnh!

[SOJI] That girl is sporting
the short but sweet look.

I haven't seen that in years!

But I definitely think
she's pulling it off!

And then there's the President.

19
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,791
She's got the greatest
tails of them all!

20
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:54,458
Wow! Such long, glorious and
perfectly crafted twin-tails!

21
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,375
Look at the graceful,
gently-wound curls

22
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:57,958
down at the tips of the tails.

23
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,625
She must have spent hours
crafting them to perfection!

in concert with her

establish a new club?

Well, Soji what
are you waiting for?

 So that's
what you want, huh?

In that case, go on and
grab a couple hands-full!

Don't be shy,
it's perfectly fine.

And I think you'll find
they're surprisingly soft.

Go ahead. You can even
squeeze them if you'd like.

[SOJI] I'm positive.
She's a senior.

She loves her
twin-tails a lot.

You're weird.

She forgot.

[TWOEARLE] That's because
the Elemelians attacked her.

twin-tail attribute

In other words, her passionate

474
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,416
[DRAGGUILDY laughing intensely]
[ELEMELIANS cheering]

475
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,250
[AIKA] So who are
these Elemelians?

476
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,000
They seem like a bunch
of perverts to me!

477
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,083
[TWOEARLE] You must not
underestimate them!

478
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,875
They are fearsome foes
who have already conquered

479
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,875
a countless number of worlds!

480
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,833
To that end, the name
of the organization

481
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:01,916
they've assembled is...
"Ultimaguil."

482
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,250
[SOJI]
I get it.

483
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,125
So the generic term for
the monsters in Ultimaguil

484
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,333
is "Elemelians?"

485
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,291
[TWOEARLE] Yes! Mister Soji,
please make sure

486
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,375
you put that long, thick,
big, strong what's-it-called

487
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,875
of yours to
good use next time!

488
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,291
[SOJI, AIKA]
It's called a wrist!

489
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,458
[TWOEARLE] Next time:
"A Twin-Tail Mystery?"

490
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,000
[SOJI]
Tail on!
