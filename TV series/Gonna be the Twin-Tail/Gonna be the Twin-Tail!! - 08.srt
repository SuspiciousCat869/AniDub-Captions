00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:12,000
[OWL GUILDY] They're so buoyant
and bouncy and silky and soft

2
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:15,041
that I dream about twin-tails
and think of them oft.

3
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:18,250
They tickle and titillate
down to my core.

4
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:21,750
I want them so badly,
so badly I'm sore.

5
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,666
Glorious bunches of
girly-girl hair--

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,750
just like breasts,
they come in a pair.

7
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,083
While we're at it,
I also like spectacles--

8
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:32,000
their shape and form
remind me of breasticles.

9
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:35,833
I feel like these words have
somehow set my soul on fire!

10
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,833
It's almost like I've
gone back in time.

11
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:43,375
The forgotten days of my youth
are all coming back to me.

12
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,750
Now this is literature!

13
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,583
I can't believe it's
already this warm outside.

14
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:26,083
Don't you get hot wearing
that white coat year-round?

15
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,125
[TWOEARLE] Actually, it's
equipped with a fully automatic

16
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,875
temperature control system,
so it keeps me nice and cool.

17
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,333
[AIKA]
Hmm...

18
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,833
If I didn't know
better, I'd say

19
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,416
you've got something
on your mind.

20
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,625
Hey! Would it cheer you up if
you wore my boobs like a hat?

21
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,250
[AIKA] Keep your oversized
udders to yourself!

22
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,625
Oh please, I can
read you like a book.

23
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,000
So there's no point in
trying to act tough now.

24
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,875
That lame punch along
with your lame attitude

25
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,500
tells me you're insecure
in your summer uniform.

26
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,375
You're worried that without
the comforting cover

27
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,000
of your blazer everyone
will finally notice

28
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,708
your flat-as-a-flounder
chest and see you

29
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,125
for the little "Miss Six
o'clock" that you really are.

30
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,208
Hey! I don't need any of your
pity for my itty-bitty...

31
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,375
Ugh! Just shut your mouth
before I pound your face in!

32
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,875
Hi. I hope everybody is
having a great morning.

33
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,583
Morning, Madame
Presi-- Whoa!

34
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,291
It looks like you
were up all night.

35
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,750
[ERINA] Pretty much.
I stayed up until morning

36
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,791
sitting at my computer,
searching the internet

37
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:21,375
for something that could help
us out and now I'm exhausted.

38
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:24,041
Thing is, no matter how many
different ways I searched,

39
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:27,208
I never found a single shred
of pornography on the web.

40
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,666
Isn't that weird? I guess
there's no porn online.

41
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,041
[AIKA] Madam President.
I would have been happy

42
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,291
to do that for you,
if you had asked me!

43
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,500
Thank you for your
kind offer, Miss Tsube.

44
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:43,083
It's just... This is something
that I'd rather do on my own.

45
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,041
[MIKOTO] After school today,
Young Miss is going out

46
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,250
to purchase an adult magazine.

47
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,583
[SOJI]
Uh...

48
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,916
[MIKOTO] I would like
to ask you to escort her.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,875
You called me down
here to go buy porn

50
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,125
with the student
council president?

51
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,208
She asked around.
And during the course

52
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,041
of her investigation,
she learned of a store

53
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:06,291
that carries a wide variety
of "adult" literature.

54
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,458
She then made it clear

55
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,333
that she didn't want me
to accompany her.

56
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,833
'Kay...

57
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,333
Now then. Watch her from a
distance so she doesn't see you.

58
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,583
But you've also got
to be close enough

59
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,083
that you can keep her safe.

60
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,583
[SOJI] How come you can't go
stalk her at the porn store?

61
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:19,958
Because I've got to
come up with a way

62
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:23,041
to sabotage all of this
arranged marriage nonsense.

63
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,666
[SOJI] Are you sure
you want to do that?

64
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,458
I mean, if you get caught aren't
you afraid you'll lose your job?

65
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,458
You shouldn't be
worrying about me.

66
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,958
Soji. Do you think
you can keep her safe?

67
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,583
Of course.

68
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:37,041
Very good. There's one more
minor detail left to attend,

69
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,208
which is to sign and stamp this
guardian service agreement.

70
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,375
Oh boy...

Hm? What's this?

00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:48,541
[OWL GUILDY] Oh! What a
wonderful sight to behold!

[OWL GUILDY] Whoa! Tailred!

Uh?

[OWL GUILDY] This can't be
happening! My masterful disguise

was supposed to be a foolproof
way to blend in perfectly!

92
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,000
And yet you still detected
me as quick as a flash!

Very impressive, Tailred!

Yeah. Well, I guess
I'm just that good.

[OWL GUILDY]
My name is Owl Guildy!

I'm a veteran soldier sent
once again to the battlefield

to defend the thing
that I hold most dear!

fighting you to the death!

You're defending the thing
that you hold most dear, huh?

Well, I'm trying to protect
something special, too!

Here we go!

What kind of bird
uses birdlime?

105
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,000
[OWL GUILDY] Unfortunately,
this is a world where some

106
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:10,583
of our most cherished attributes
are languishing in obscurity,

107

biding their time
until they're forgotten.

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,583
All I want to do is preserve
them so that they can be enjoyed

for generations to come.
Dark Grasper has a plan

110
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:23,333
to help these time-honored

111
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,458
Wait, you work
with Dark Grasper?

112
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,333
[OWL GUILDY] Don't waste
your energy. I can assure you

113
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,333
that it's quite impossible
to break through my birdlime.

114
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:36,083
Listen! The great tragedy
is that literacy attribute,

115
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,750
and minds that
adore literature,

116
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,791
are slowly vanishing
from this planet.

117
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,333
Since time immemorial,
literature has been

118
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,083
the gateway to a
fantastical world

119
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:49,666
of unlimited imagination.
Then everything changed!

120
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,583
Nowadays your bookstores
are filled with nothing

121
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,750
but salacious images of young
women dressed as harlots!

122
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,500
How dare you call
that trash literature?!

123
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:58,916
Yeah? Well maybe
people just find

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,375
picture books
easier to read!

125
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,291
[OWL GUILDY] I will not deny
that this garbage can be

126
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,958
a gateway to true literature
for children like you.

127
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,375
However, it takes something
more substantial than these

128
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,625
trite picture books to truly
nurture a rich imagination.

you're a lot different

You're not the one
who gets to decide that!

It's up to the people

what you think!

As long our literature is

fun fact about me.

151

It was the glory of

my imagination and
showed me who I really am.

What I'm trying to say is:
Twin-tails are my literature!

154
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:34,291
[OWL GUILDY coughs]
That's the Tailred I know.

155
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,750
There's no way I could
refute such passion.

156
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,833
Therefore, I must
concede defeat.

157
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,208
That's a smart move.
I'm glad I was able

158
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:44,166
to protect her while she
bought her porno mag.

159
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,250
[OWL GUILDY] Wait!
What did you just say?

160
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,166
[TAILRED] I said, "porno mag."
The girl you were creeping on

161
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,083
earlier was actually
here to buy porn.

162
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,916
[OWL GUILDY] Aahh! She was
buying a pornographic magazine?

163
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,291
That's outrageous! Why would a
girl with twin-tails that classy

164
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:01,125
debase herself by buying that
kind of filth in broad daylight?

165
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,041
Ah, the humanity!

166
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,291
Like I said earlier, don't go
pushing your snobby ideals on--

167
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,208
[OWL GUILDY] You listen to me,
Tailred, and you listen good.

168
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,875
Remember these words.

169
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:17,000
It is not me that is dying.
It is literature!

170
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,291
[ERINA]
Eh?

171
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,083
Soji!

172
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,125
Uh, hey, Erina.

173
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,750
What a strange coincidence
running into you here.

174
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,916
It's perfect timing,
actually. You see...

175
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,250
I've failed us all and I feel
like I need to apologize.

176
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:40,125
What? So you ended up not being
able to buy the porno magazine?

177
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,416
That's right. I didn't
know this, but apparently

178
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,000
you have to be 18 to
buy magazines like that.

179
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:49,375
I'm so sick of being treated
like I'm some delicate child.

180
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,916
I can't do anything by myself,

181
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,458
because people are always
trying to protect me.

182
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,041
At this rate, I'll
never be able to feel

183
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,416
like I'm pulling
my own weight.

184
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,166
I'm so worthless.

185
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,208
Erina. Don't talk
like that, okay?

186
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,791
We're grateful
to have you here.

187
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,250
When you feel like
you don't belong,

188
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,583
just try to think
about your twin-tails.

189
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:15,041
Remember, these will
always bind us together.

190
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,416
And It's not like you only
have Soji to rely on either.

191
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,291
I mean, I'm here for you too!

192
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,000
[ERINA] Thank you, Aika,
that means a lot to me!

193
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,416
[ERINA]
What's this?

194
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,166
A Twoearle phone.
It's a communications terminal

195
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,250
that I've been meaning to
give you all for a while.

196
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,666
Consider it a token
of friendship

197
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,750
and solidarity
from me to you.

198
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:39,875
Miss Twoearle! Thank you
so much, everyone!

199
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:45,166
And thank you, Soji.
For everything.

200
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,500
[SOJI] The bond between
us Twin Tails is stronger

201
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,375
than ever before and I
gotta say, it feels great!

202
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:59,416
[MIKOTO] Young Miss.
The mistress is calling you.

203
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,625
[ERINA] Well, then.
I'll take my leave.

204
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,958
Good night, Mother.
Sleep well.

205
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,541
[ERINA sighs]

206
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:24,958
[SOJI yawns]

207
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,500
[ERINA]
Good morning.

208
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,833
[SOJI gasps]

209
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,208
What has she done?

210
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,208
Why would she forsake
her beautiful twin-tails?

211
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:45,750
Damn it all! This is so unfair!
I tried with all my might,

212
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,375
but I couldn't protect
what was dearest to me!

213
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,875
Don't read too
much into this.

214
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,000
[SOJI] Huh? So she's just
rebelling against her mother?

215
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,916
[MIKOTO] Correct.
She's lashing out.

216
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,625
Poor girl. It hasn't
been easy for her.

217
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,750
But she's finally
standing up to her mother,

218
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,458
Emu Shindo, the chairman
of the school's trustees.

219
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,708
[SOJI] But why now? Is it
because of the marriage talks?

220
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,458
[MIKOTO] Those have
been resolved.

221
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,166
But regrettably,
the mistress learned

222
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,958
of Young Miss' search for
a pornographic magazine.

223
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,541
Aw man, so she's in trouble?

224
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,375
[MIKOTO] No. Quite the
opposite, in fact.

225
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,208
The mistress was rather
delighted that she was

226
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,583
finally taking an
interest in such things.

227
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,958
But, as you know, Young
Miss has been busy lately

228
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,458
what with her
student council work

229
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:34,666
and her "extracurricular"
activities with the Twin Tails.

230
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,291
The mistress took this to mean
that her life was out of order,

231
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:41,000
so she began talks for an
entirely new arranged marriage.

232
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:44,208
In response to this, Young
Miss became very hard-headed.

233
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,708
That's when she took
down her twin-tails,

234
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,541
which are essentially
a family rule.

235
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:52,375
[EMU] You are my daughter,
Erina! You will do as I say!

236
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,250
My decision on this
wedding is final!

237
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,708
It makes no difference
what you do with your hair.

238
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,875
I can only assume you
took down your twin-tails

239
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:03,833
with the childish hope that
it would change my mind. Yes?

240
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,291
[SOJI gasps]

241
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,416
What a beautiful
set of twin-tails!

242
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,666
It's like she's some
kind of twin-tail goddess!

243
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,958
I think I just hit
the twin-tail jackpot.

244
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,541
Now that I think of it.
I'm actually relieved

245
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,291
you've taken down those
soulless twin-tails of yours.

246
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,541
After all,
you never earned them.

247
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,625
[door opens loudly]

248
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,750
I won't let you talk that
way about my friend!

249
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,250
How dare you? What's
your name, young man?

250
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:33,000
My name is Soji Mitsuka! You and
I need to have a little talk!

251
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,666
It's about your daughter's hair!

252
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,833
[EMU]
Huh?

253
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,583
You said she didn't
earn her twin-tails.

254
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,791
And that's where you're wrong!

255
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,333
[EMU] What is this?
As her mother, I can say

256
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,166
without a doubt that
I know her twin-tails

257
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,125
better than anyone else.
If I say she didn't earn them,

258
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,000
then she didn't earn them
and that's the way it is.

259
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,916
No way! I guarantee you
I know Erina's twin-tails

260
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,083
better than you ever will!

261
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,000
[EMU]
What do you mean?

262
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,041
Did Soji really storm
into the chairman's office

263
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,375
to try and get Erina back
to being a Twin Tail?

264
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,416
Keep your voice down.

265
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,375
[SOJI] Erina!
I can't imagine

266
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,916
how frustrated you are.
But it's just not like you

267
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,916
to take it out on
your own twin-tails!

268
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,458
[ERINA] Soji. Do you remember
what I told you before?

269
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:14,750
Shindo women wearing their hair
in twin-tails is a family rule.

270
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,166
So taking them down
is the greatest

271
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,750
expression of free
will that I have.

272
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,458
[EMU] Erina. Do you really
trust this young man enough

273
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,541
to let him in on
personal family matters?

274
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,750
[ERINA] Yes.
I trust him completely.

275
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,666
[EMU] Huh. You just
told me that you know

276
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,250
my daughters' twin-tails
better than I ever will.

277
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,666
Tell me, young man, do you still
stand by this rather bold claim?

278
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,333
I do! I know that you,
as her mother,

279
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,208
usually see her twin-tails
more than anyone else.

280
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,083
But if that's
the case, how is it

281
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,958
that you haven't noticed
how strong and beautiful

282
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,500
her twin-tails have become
over the last month?

283
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,458
You're more interested
in pointing out her faults

284
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,166
than you are in
taking the time to see

285
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,583
how much your
daughter has truly grown.

286
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,875
Just try to look beneath
the surface. Please.

287
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,708
You've got to understand that
what she's doing is important.

288
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,041
That being said, I know
her grades have slipped

289
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,791
and that she's not doing as
much on the student council.

290
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,625
But those things were
sacrificed so she could

291
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,583
accomplish something much
more meaningful with her life.

292
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,916
Oh, Soji.

293
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,916
[SOJI]
So, I'm begging you.

294
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,125
Try to look past it for
a little while longer.

295
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,583
Ow! Ow! Ow! I think you're
fracturing my cranium!

296
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,916
It hurts!

297
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,333
[SOJI] Then, I'm sure
that she'll go right back

298
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,375
to being the hard-working
student council president

299
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,208
that she's always been.

300
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
[EMU] And I didn't think
there were any real men

301
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,875
left in the world. But I
can tell that a deep love

302
