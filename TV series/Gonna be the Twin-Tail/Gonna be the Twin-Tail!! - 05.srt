Uh. What are you doing?

00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,791
[TAILRED]
Huh? Oh. Nothing.

4
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:22,000
It's not what you
think it is, I swear! See?

5
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,333
[TAILRED] Now that the
Twin-Tail Club is official,

6
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,250
I'm trying to come up with
some activities that will

7
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:30,541
help spread the message of the
true majesty of twin-tails.

8
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,125
It's the only way we'll
ever attract new members.

9
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,375
Right. Or maybe
you wanted to transform

10
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,375
into Tailred so you could
sit there like a creeper

11
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:38,708
fingering your twin-tails?

12
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,125
[TAILRED]
That's not it!

13
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,875
[TWOEARLE] Mhmm-hm!
Someone's upset!

14
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,333
It's because you
have small boobies.

15
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:45,833
And your twin-tails are
the only thing you've got

16
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,541
going for you and now
you're super jealous

17
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,125
because Mr. Soji doesn't
need yours anymore!

18
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:53,125
It must be hard to be
flat chested and useless.

All I ever wanted

25
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:44,833
was to see Tailred...
in a swimsuit.

26
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,583
And maybe have her
sit on my lap.

We're late for school.

From this moment forward,

00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,291
I will be your new

One more thing.

If any of you have single

Don't you think
this is weird?

43
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,625
Why is the president's
maid teaching?

44
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,208
It doesn't make any sense.

45
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,041
Yeah. I know.

46
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,625
And, we have a new

I'm one of Soji Mitsuka's

Aw, come on!

go peeking, okay?

Congratulations on

It's a big achievement.

Hey! Take your
hands off her!

67
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,500
[SOJI] I'm really sorry
about that, but the thing is--

68
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,458
We'd love to have you
come in, but unfortunately,

69
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,166
we're still
sorting things out.

70
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,041
I'd be more than happy
to lend you a hand.

71
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,833
After all, cleaning up
is my specialty, you know?

72
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,500
Thanks, but that's okay.
I'm sure you're busy.

73
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,000
What with your new teaching job
and being the president's maid,

74
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,875
you must have your
hands completely full.

75

Head maid, thank you.

76

The truth is, things are
a little out of control.

are on the loose

and now this mysterious
Tailblue shows up.

And so...
as a protective measure,

80
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,125
I've taken a position here.

81
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:17,125
That way I can keep my eyes
on her "twenty-four-seven."

82

the Twin-Tail Club as well.

today, right?

You can call me Twoearle!

93

She's actually
a relative of mine.

94
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,000
She moved here
from somewhere far away.

95
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,166
That's the story
we're going with, anyway.

96
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,500
Wow, that's wonderful.

97
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,125
I hope you
enjoy your time here.

If you need anything,
just ask.

99
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:01,166
[SOJI] So, Madam President,
what brings you here today?

100
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,125
I looked over
your application.

101
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,791
And I have a question about
one thing in particular.

102
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,041
Of course. Whatever it is,
we're glad to help.

103
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,833
Super. So, it says
your club is focused

104
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,208
on studying twin-tails.

105
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,250
And yet you've also
vowed to protect them.

106
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,041
That's absolutely right!

107
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,458
Well, my question
is this. Tell me,

108
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,291
why all the fuss
over twin-tails?

109
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,041
Because they're awesome!

110
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,500
Liking something
is one thing,

111
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,291
however, loving it enough
to form a club is another.

112
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,875
Not to be rude,
but does a person really

113
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,041
need a reason
to love twin-tails?

114
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,125
[ERINA]
Mm.

115
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,916
[SOJI] She's got some of
the most amazing twin-tails

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,333
I've ever seen.

117
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:37,041
I thought she would
approve for sure.

118
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,500
Wait, I get it!

119
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,333
She's trying to determine
the depths of my affection.

120
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,625
She wants to see
who loves them more.

121
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,375
Well, I won't be outdone!

122
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,416
[AIKA]
Hmm?

123
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,791
Well thank you
for your time.

124
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,375
I have no issues with
your club or its activities.

125
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,416
As Student Council
President it's not my place

126
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,250
to pass judgment on the virtue
of any specific organization.

127
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,083
But there is one thing.

128
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,541
[SOJI]
Uh.

129
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,333
[gasps]

130
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,583
[AIKA gasps]

131
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:15,916
As you probably
already know,

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,208
gaudy accessories are
against school rules.

133
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,708
It's designed to look like
Tailred's isn't it?

134
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,000
I've seen quite a few
of them around lately.

135
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,625
[SOJI]
Uh...

136
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,708
Pardon my interruption, but
we're just about out of time.

137
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,250
[ERINA] I look forward
to the Twin-Tail Club

138
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,666
making great strides as our
newest campus organization.

139
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,416
So what in the heck
was that all about, Twoearle?

140
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,791
I thought regular people
couldn't see the Tail Bracelet

141
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,875
until after we transformed?

142
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,458
That's supposed
to be the case.

143
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,666
The Imagine Chaff technology
should make it invisible.

144
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,250
[SOJI]
That's it, then!

145
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,500
The President has an incredibly
powerful twin-tail attribute,

146
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,083
which explains why Ultimaguil
keeps on attacking her.

147
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,750
She's like us!

148
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,625
Yes, I suppose that
hypothesis could be true.

149
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,416
[AIKA]
Uh, Twoearle?

150
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,083
You said you were giving
this place a makeover,

151
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,625
but it's exactly the same.

152
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,375
[TWOEARLE] Oh, it's
made over, all right.

153
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,541
I even installed a secret
dimensional transporter.

154
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,666
Where did you find room for
a dimensional transporter?

155
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,333
A place where
flat-chested psychopaths

156
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,208
can't see it. Sorry.

157
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,458
[AIKA]
What did you say?!

158
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,625
[SOJI] What if
she was playing dumb?

159
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:27,416
What if she's already onto us

162
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,500
has been defeated
by the Twin Tails.

163
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,208
[ELEMELIAN 2A] Tailred
was bad enough but now

164
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,125
we also have to deal with
her counterpart, Tailblue.

165
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,875
[SPARROW GUILDY]
These "Twin Tails" are just

166
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,375
too strong for us, I'm afraid.

167
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,833
We have all but lost our
greatest fighting force now.

168
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,583
There's no time to waste!

169
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,625
[ELEMELIAN 2B]
An urgent message!

170
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:57,125
Krakeguildy's regiment
has just arrived, sir.

171
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,791
[SPARROW GUILDY]
What? Already?

172
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,750
[ELEMELIAN 2C] Leviaguildy's
men are here as well, sir!

173
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,625
[SPARROW GUILDY] Both
Krakeguildy and Leviaguildy

174
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,125
have come to our aid.

175
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,625
With these two unstoppable
forces combined,

176
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,291
the Twin Tails are finished.

177
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,083
They don't stand a chance
against us now!

[KRAKEGUILDY]
Hmph. Leviaguildy.

182
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,958
I have long since
abandoned trying to

183
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:32,208
talk you out of your vulgar
obsession with gigantic breasts,

184
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,833
and so I shall leave it
at this: agree to disagree.

185
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,166
[LEVIAGUILDY] How I pity you
and your antiquated views.

186
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,166
To believe in the primitive
notion that twin-tails

187
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,208
actually look better
with flat chests

188
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,916
is nothing short of folly.

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,875
I fear you are lost
forever, Krakeguildy!

190
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:47,916
[SPARROW GUILDY]
Come now.

a common purpose.

[LEVIAGUILDY] Sparrow
Guildy, there's no need

193
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,083
for you to play mediator.

194
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:56,000
I've already sent some of
my men down to the surface.

195
00:09:56,083 --> 00:10:00,000
We'll see soon enough which
of us is more competent.

You got the jump on me?

Dark Grasper is coming here?

200

The chief's most
trusted officer.

201
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,791

[BUFFALO GUILDY] You possess
magnificent twin-tails!

206
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:31,083
Certainly worthy
of capturing! Hm?

What a delightfully
large bust you have.

It's the President!

213
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,083
Careful, she's already
suspicious because of

214
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,958
that incident with
your Tail Bracelet.

215
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,833
We'll be in trouble if
she finds out who we are.

Yeah. Good call.

[BUFFALO GUILDY] I won't let
you interfere, Twin Tails.

00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,041
My name is Buffalo Guildy!

219
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,250
I would gladly give
my life for my master,

220
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,541
whose goal is to spread
the giant-breast attribute

221
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,208
across the land!

222

What? The
giant-breast attribute?

Jerk. Wave Lance go!

224
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,500
I'll handle this
sleeze-bag, Red.

225
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,541
Just make sure you
get these people to safety.

226

Uh, okay.

Come on, miss.
Right this way!

about giant breasts, huh?

of you! Aura Pillar!

[TWOEARLE] Yes, it's possible.
Using this elemela orb,

243
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,916
I could make
giant-breasted Tail Gear.

244
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,875
You seriously think
you could make that happen?

waiting for, do it?

Actually, I have some
really terrific news.

00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,916
[SOJI]
Whoa!

250
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,458
Using the elemela
orb you obtained

251
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:41,875
by defeating Dragguildy,

252
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,666
I have developed a new
and improved Tail Gear.

253
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,333
Granted, at this stage
it's just a prototype.

254
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,458
But I'm very close
to being done with it.

255
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,083
And get this.

256
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,708
This Gear also incorporates
the giant-breast attribute

257
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,166
we got from Buffalo
Guildy's elemela orb,

258
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,916
making it a hybrid gear
with a never before

259
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,416
achieved functionality.

260
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
So, you're saying...
this Gear can transform me

261
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,958
into a person with big boobs?

00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,583
Please, Twoearle!
Make that Tail Gear

266
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,416
and give it to me right now,
and you have my word:

267
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,750
I'll be your
best friend forever!

268
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,875
So, that's what you want?
In that case...

269
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,583
Hm-hmmm.

270
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,166
First, you have to
bow down and apologize

271
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,833
for all the heartache
and pain you've caused me--

272

[AIKA]
Please, forgive me!

273
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,125
I'm sorry for everything
I ever did to you!

I won't be swayed
by emotion, Miss Aika!

277
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,875
This is a ruse so you can
try to get back at me later!

00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,541
[sobbing]

279
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,041
I'm begging you!
Please, Twoearle!

280
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,583
Listen, Aika, I think you're
being a little dramatic.

281
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,416
Haven't you heard that
size isn't everything?

282
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,833
[AIKA]
That's a cruel lie!

283
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,208
Really?

284
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,000
[TWOEARLE]
Mr. Soji.

285
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,416
Under normal circumstances,
I tend to stand in opposition

286
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,250
to everything
Miss Aika says or does.

287
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,125
But, in this particular case,
I am afraid I have to

288
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,333
agree with her.
There isn't a girl alive

289
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,333
who doesn't care about
the size of her breasts.

290
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,750
I'll grant your wish.

291
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,291
It would be an honor
and a privilege.

[giggling]

293
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,750
This is the
third Tail Gear.

294
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,083
So go ahead. Try it!

295
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,291
Tail On!

296
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,625
[AIKA]
Hm?

297
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,500
I said,
"Tail On," bracelet!

298
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,666
What's wrong? Why isn't
it reacting to me?

299
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,083
Perhaps it's a matter of
compatibility, Miss Aika.

300
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,791
This Tail Gear is
specifically designed for

301
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,666
a person whose chest
doesn't look suspiciously

302
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,041
like an ironing board.

303
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,041
Yep. Apparently, there
are some limitations

304
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,625
that even the marvels of future
technology can't correct.

305
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,958
[AIKA] Figures. I was
a complete fool to actually

306
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,750
believe Tail Gear
could transform me

307
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,458
into a
giant-breasted superhero.

308
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,208
Look, Aika. Twoearle
may say it's your body,

309
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,375
but I don't really think so.

310
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,791
[BOTH]
Huh?

311
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,708
It has nothing to do with
the size of your breasts.

312
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,875
Just think about
what you've done.

313
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,458
You've been fighting
with all you've got

314

Why would he come here
so soon after our arrival?

00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,291
[KRAKEGUILDY]
It can't be.

472
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,875
[SPARROW GUILDY]
This is Dark Grasper?

473
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,875
Our chief's right hand.

474
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,416
The keeper of discipline among

475
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,250
all of the Ultimaguil
organization...

476
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,125
...is a little human girl?

477
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,375
[ERINA] As though in sync
with my own grand entrance,

478
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,500
the enemy's new
lineup appears, too.

479
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,250
[MIKOTO] More importantly,
next time Soji and I

480
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:57,041
register together, and our
life as newlyweds begins!

481
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:57,958
[AIKA, ERINA, TWOEARLE]
Huh?!

482
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,083
[SOJI]
Wait just a darn minute!

483
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,333
I don't know
anything about this!

484
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:01,583
[MIKOTO]
Of course you don't.

485
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,083
This is the first time
I'm saying it.

486
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:04,458
But the way things
have been going,

487
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:06,291
that seems like a
logical next step to me.

488
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,250
[AIKA] That is completely
off-base and crazy!

489
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:10,041
Ah, our preview time
is almost up!

490
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,375
[SOJI] Yeah,
I better say it then!

491
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:14,333
Next time: "Brake Release!
Tailyellow!"

492
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,250
[ERINA]
Tail On!
