C'mon, it's not that bad.

00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:15,916
It's not like you
started doing all of this

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,250
just so you could
become more popular.

That's easy for
you to say since

their mother adores you.

Is it my birthday?

This is like a dream.
Pinch me.

Hello there, friends!

Isn't it such a beautiful day?

20
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,875
[SOJI, AIKA] Good morning,
Madam President!

21
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,458
What's going on? You seem
to be in a good mood.

22
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:55,041
Indeed! Ever since I saw that
Tailred has a new sidekick,

23
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,500
I've been on cloud nine!

24
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,000
Madame President,

25
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,458
I am so happy
to hear you say that.

26
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,583
I worry about
Tailred so much.

27
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,833
I can't bear the
thought of her fighting

28
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,000
to keep us safe
with no one to help her.

29
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,041
Huh?

30
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,583
We all know
how strong she is.

31
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,666
And I know she'll
always be there for us.

32
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,708
But sooner or later, she's
going to need a helping hand.

33
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,083
And I'm not talking
about super fans like us.

34
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,458
In the end, we won't
be there to help her fight.

35
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:21,041
But now, Tailblue is
there to do what we can't.

36
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,833
She'll look out for Tailred!

Wow, you really are
a big fan of the Twin Tails

38
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,458
aren't you, Madam President?

39
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,625
You probably think it's
strange for a girl my age

40
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:30,750
to feel this way.
But the thing is,

41
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,791
I've always been
obsessed with heroes.

42
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,208
It's weird.
But I still watch those

43
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:36,208
superhero shows made for kids.

44
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:39,416
Sometimes, I even
buy the toys. Hang on.

45
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,583
Uh. Are you okay?

46
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:46,458
[sighs]

47
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,166
Yeah. It's nothing at all.

48
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,916
Sorry about that. See ya!

00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,875

that you submitted

51
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,458

Uh! The Twin-Tail club!

It was actually approved.
All right!

55
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,041
[SOJI] Every day from then
on the Ultimaguil creeps

56
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,125
came to steal
twin-tail attribute.

57
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,375
[AIKA] But each one
of them had their own

00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,083
pervy private agendas,

59
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,541
so they basically ignored
their overall mission.

60
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,125

the reason behind it,

winning streak.

[AIKA] It must be nice
getting to be so popular.

63

Then again, who wouldn't
like being a superstar.

64
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,875
[SOJI] Would you please
cut that out, already?

along with 458 Ultiroids
have been obliterated.

68
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,000
[DRAGGUILDY] At this point
it's clear that sending

69
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,083

deaths will accomplish nothing.

70

heating up with an old friend

and you went back to her room.

108
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,875
But the mood changed,
and you didn't bother

109
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,666
to save the game, did you?

110
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,125
You figured you'd start
with a little pillow talk,

111
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,333
and take if from there,

112

but then it suddenly
jumped to the next day.

that no one has
ever laid a hand on it.

00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,666
you love twin-tails
more than me!

160
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:22,958
[DRAGGUILDY yells]

161
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,416
[TAILRED grunts]

162
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,875
[TWOEARLE] Mr. Soji,
the enemy's attack force

163
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,583
is greater than your photon
absorber's threshold rating!

164
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,333
[DRAGGUILDY]
Now let's try it faster!

165
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,791
[TAILRED gasps]

166
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,708
Now that's
swordsmanship!

167
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,541
[DRAGGUILDY]
Ah! I see that volley

168
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,750
wasn't nearly fast enough!

169
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,958
[TAILBLUE]
Are you okay, Red?

170
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,416
Hey. What kind of
sword is that?

171
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,416
[DRAGGUILDY] This? It's a
twin-tail sword!

172
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,791
Huh?

173
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,583
[DRAGGUILDY] And you are
the first of my opponents

174
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:56,041
to ever elude the
ungodly speed of my slashes.

175
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,833
Well yeah,
I can totally see them!

176
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,083
Most likely because of
the deep love for twin-tails

177
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,083
that I carry in
my heart at all times.

178
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,541
Oh-kay?

179
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,666
[DRAGGUILDY] Although
you're my mortal enemy,

180
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,250
I admire your passion.

181
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:11,083
So I'll try to cut you in half
as painlessly as possible!

182
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,625
[DRAGGUILDY]
Magnificent twin-tails!

183
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,125
It pains me to
call you my enemy!

184
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,416
So weird.

185
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,625
You know what?

186
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,000
If you weren't such
a creep I bet we'd have

187
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,958
a great time hanging out
and telling stories

188
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,416
about all of the
twin-tails we've admired!

189
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
[TAILBLUE grunts]

190
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,083
[DRAGGUILDY]
I just realized.

191
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,916
True twin-tail
attribute is something

192
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,083
that possesses
mutual resonance!

193
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,333
Mutual resonance?

194
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,708
You mean you and me?

195
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,416
He's saying you're
the same kind of perv!

196
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,125
Honestly, I think he's right!

197
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,375
[DRAGGUILDY] A blue warrior?
How long has she been here?

198
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,708
[TAILBLUE] Long enough
to feel deeply disturbed.

199
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,416
[DRAGGUILDY] Now that
I see you up close,

200
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,000
I can tell it was
the warrior from

201
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,291
that other world
who put you up to this.

202
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,208
Huh?
From another world?

203
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,583
[DRAGGUILDY]
You don't know?

204
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,541
There was once a girl
who challenged us

205
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,041
to battle by herself.

206
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:59,416
She was clad in the same armor
that you are wearing now.

207
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,791
What did you say?

208
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,416
Are you telling us that
you've already battled with

209
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,041
another version of Tailblue
on a different planet?

210
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,291
[DRAGGUILDY]
That's right!

211
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,333
She had an obscenely
large bust that looked

212
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,500
out of place
with her twin-tails.

213
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,083
And when you looked
her in the eyes,

214
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,791
there was no connection.

215
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,375
She had big boobs?
Wait, you mean?

216
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,500
[DRAGGUILDY] It's quite
ironic that the brilliance

217
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,583
you two display
wearing that armor

218
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,875
will end up completely
destroying this planet

219
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,750
the exact same way
it did back then.

220
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,125
[TWOEARLE exhales quaverly]

221
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,541
What are you
talking about?

222
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,083
What does that even mean?

223
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,250
[DRAGGUILDY]
She was once considered

224
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,750
a goddess on her world.

225
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,833
Eventually everyone
wanted to wear twin-tails

226
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,500
so they could
be just like her.

227
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,916
And that's when
the real fun began.

228
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,375
Are you saying...?

229
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,166
[DRAGGUILDY] Correct.
The twin-tail attribute

230
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,416
that we crave spread
around the planet.

231
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,250
Before long,
the entire world became

232
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,458
the most ideal hunting
ground we could imagine.

233
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,791
[grunts]

234
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,291
[DRAGGUILDY] The people
of this world have begun

235
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,333
to idolize you as their savior.

236
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:59,208
In reality, you will be the
cause of its destruction.

237
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,666
Eeh!

238
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,833
[TAILBLUE] This is
all part of their plan.

239
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,000
We fell for it hook,
line, and sinker.

240
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,125
[TAILRED]
No!

241
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,458
[TAILBLUE]
Can't you see?

242
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,291
Look, maybe Twoearle
gave in to despair

243
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,625
and now she's trying
to make sure that

244
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,208
all the twin-tails
on our world end up

245
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,625
the same as they did on hers.

246
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,416
Twoearle wouldn't do
something like that!

247
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,875
Just think about it, Red!

248
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,291
We're fighting
the same way she did

249
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,458
and she's letting
twin-tail mania spread.

250
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,916
She may not work for them,

251
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,750
but they couldn't
do this without her!

252
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,458
If what she's doing
helps you guys out,

253
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,666
why risk everything
by telling us about it?

254
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,750
[DRAGGUILDY] Because Tailred's
twin-tail attribute

255
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,125
is the real deal.

256
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,541
[gasps]

257
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,250
[DRAGGUILDY] Having engaged
her in battle, I know,

258
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,458
without a doubt, that she
truly loves twin-tails

259
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,416
more than anything else.

260
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,166
[DRAGGUILDY] I would rather
fight without any deception.

261
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,208
Consider it a
gesture of goodwill,

262
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,666
so that she doesn't
learn the truth

263
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,333
after her world is destroyed,

264
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,583
and then become
consumed by guilt.

265
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,625
[TAILRED] Thanks but
no thanks, Dragguildy.

266
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,333
You can keep your goodwill.

267
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,000
Now more than ever,
I know what I have to do!

268
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,416
What are you
getting at, Red?

269
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,375
It doesn't make any sense
to keep fighting!

270
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,083
I think it makes
perfect sense!

271
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,500
These jerks want to harvest
twin-tail attribute.

272
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,541
Thing is, it's just now starting
to develop on our planet.

273
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,416
But they can tell
it's here to stay!

274
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,916
Huh?

275
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,750
If it were a passing fad,
people would get tired of it.

276
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,583
Don't you get it?
There's no reason to worry.

277
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,708
Huh?

278
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:23,666
I'd say we're
lucky you creeps

279
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,083
set your sights on us.

280
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,666
You got the ball rolling
on a twin-tail revolution.

281
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,375
And that means all the girls
who are just starting

282
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,041
to wear twin-tails also
have high attribute levels.

283
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,458
What're you saying?

284
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,875
All I gotta do is get this
weirdo outta the picture.

285
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,875
And the glorious gospel
of twin-tails will spread

286
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,666
to the furthest
reaches of the world.

287
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,875
And that would be
like a dream come true.

288
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,625
[DRAGGUILDY]
Wait. What?

289
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,791
[laughing]

290
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,041
Uh. Did I miss something?

291
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,916
You are
completely hopeless!

292
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,583
You're crazy for twin-tails.
And you're just plain crazy.

293
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,708
Your passion never
ceases to amaze me.

294
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,250
It's what I love about you.

295
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,583
Thank you, Tailblue!

296
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,500
I can't imagine
a better compliment!

297
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,458
[DRAGGUILDY] Tailred. The girl
with the ultimate twin-tails.

298
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,125
My admiration for you
soars even higher now.

299
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,791
Your indomitable spirit
is unshaken even while

300
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,875
facing the cataclysmic
end of the world.

301
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,416
[TAILRED]
End of the world or not,

302
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,708
I'm sick of listening to
all your evil dragon crap!

303
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,291
Now you listen up!

304
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,583
I'm ready to fight to
the death for what I love!

305
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,833
[TWOEARLE]
That's enough. Dragguildy!

306
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,500
[TAILRED whimpers]

307
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,291
Who was that?!

308
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,250
[DRAGGUILDY] Who are you?
Identify yourself!

309
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,583
[TWOEARLE] I am
the planetary avenger!

310
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,833
The Masked Twin-Tail!

311
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,083
[DRAGGUILDY] The Masked
Twin-Tail, huh?

312
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:44,500
I'm not reading any discernable
attribute strength from you.

313
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,541
[TWOEARLE] I'm not here
to fight with you.

314
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,666
[TAILRED] If you're
not here to fight,

315
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,625
then what exactly
are you doing here?

316
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,208
[TWOEARLE] I think it's
important that you listen

317
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,541
to what I have to say.

318
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,833
[TAILRED, TAILBLUE]
Huh?

319
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,375
[TWOEARLE] Red, that first
day when you fought,

320
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,625
the reason they were looking
for the ultimate twin-tail

321
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,250
was not so they could simply
take your attribute strength.

322
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,541
Their plan was
much more insidious.

323
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,333
It was to develop whoever
had the strongest

324
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,791
twin-tail attribute
into a hero of sorts.

325
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,000
A hero that the world
could rally behind.

326
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,833
And eventually try to emulate.

327
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:11,958
[gasps]

328
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,250
[DRAGGUILDY] Just as
we have done with

329
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,000
countless worlds
before yours.

330
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,541
So this has
happened a lot?

331
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,166
[TWOEARLE] Yes. I developed
Tail Gear from technology

332
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,916
that they
intentionally leaked

333
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,875
and I did my best
to fight them with it.

334
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,625
Little did I know that
they were just using me

335
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,125
as a means to an end.

336
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,208
I was merely
a pawn in their game.

337
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,750
[DRAGGUILDY] So, you're the
woman who so valiantly

338
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,875
fought against us
on that distant world.

339
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,583
But I'm curious--
Why is it I no longer detect

340
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,375
the incredible twin-tail
attribute you used to emanate?

341
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,250
[TWOEARLE] Because
I relinquished it.

342
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,750
[DRAGGUILDY]
What?

343
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,291
[TWOEARLE] I got the feeling
that something wasn't right

344
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,541
when I was fighting.

345
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,208
It was almost as though
the enemy's weaknesses

346
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,791
were a little too
easy to spot.

347
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,500
That's when I started
to put the pieces together.

348
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,458
[TAILBLUE] After you figured
out what those freaks

349
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,208
were really up to,
you knew what you had to do

350
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,791
in order to ruin their plans!

351
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,083
[TWOEARLE] That's right.
All I needed to do was

352
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,125
act in a way that would
make people lose interest

353
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:05,166
in twin-tails.
But I couldn't do it!

354
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,541
[TAILRED gasps]

355
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,750
[TWOEARLE] You see, I
refused to let the newfound

356
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,125
twin-tail attribute
fade away into nothingness.

357
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,875
There was no way
I was going to stand by

358
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,375
and watch all those girls
who were trying to

359
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,541
awaken something beautiful
in themselves go back

360
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,416
to their horribly dated,
uninspired hairstyles!

361
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,833
Huh?

362
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,125
[TWOEARLE] But I wasn't
strong enough, and I lost.

363
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,500
While I was struggling
with all of that,

364
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,708
the invasion continued until
they bled my world dry

365
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,500
of all twin-tail attribute.

366
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,458
It was my own foolish pride
that destroyed my world.

367
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,541
Oh no!
That sounds like hell!

368
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,291
[TWOEARLE] It was. After I
realized what I had done,

369
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,916
I got rid of my twin-tails
and I never looked back.

370
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,791
With those distractions
out of the way,

371
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,750
I devoted myself to constructing
another set of Tail Gear.

372
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,500
And eventually,
I completed the Tail Gear

373
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,125
that you're wearing now.

374
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:52,250
Oh Twoearle. How
incredibly brave of you.

375
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,708
[TWOEARLE gasps]

376
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,000
[DRAGGUILDY]
She's no martyr.

377
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,458
That was nothing
but vengefulness,

378
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,041
plain and simple.

379
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,916
Ex-Tailblue, I underestimated
your deep love of twin-tails.

380
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,916
However, it won't
make any difference

381
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,458
now that there are two
of you instead of just one.

382
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,708
In fact, having the
two of you will help the

383
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:12,750
twin-tail phenomenon spread
across the globe even faster.

384
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,208
Two of us?

385
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,625
That's where you're
mistaken, Dragguildy!

386
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,041
Let me break this down.

387
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,666
Having Twin-tails requires
more than just the hair.

388
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,041
You have to have
a head. And that's her!

389
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,125
Which means
that all three of us

390
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,833
are the Twin Tails!

391
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,458
[TWOEARLE]
Red!

392
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,083
Ugh. Come on.

393
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,291
Does everything
in the world have to

394
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,250
be about twin-tails
for you guys?

395
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,291
Twoearle, I realize now that
you never meant any harm.

396
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,875
I'm so sorry for doubting you.

397
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,791
All right, then.
You ready to go?

398
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,458
Yeah!

399
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,000
[DRAGGUILDY] I hope you
realize that you are

400
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,000
outnumbered 300 to 1.

401

you stand a chance?

do my best to take out

403
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,125

handle the rest of those

404
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,833
Ultiroid guys
on your own?

405
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,000
Piece o' cake.
Sounds to me

406
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,500
like I got the easy job.
Are you sure?

407
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,416
Yeah! Let's go!

fighting me alone, eh?

it takes to defeat you!

[DRAGGUILDY]
Hm!

413
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,375
I was told that
you have to consume

414
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,500
attribute strength to
survive. Is that right?

415

'Cause this is your last
chance to go on a diet.

416
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,500
[DRAGGUILDY] The thing
I enjoy most about being

417
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:20,000
an apex predator is that I
eat what I want, when I want.

418
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:23,333
Do you honestly expect me to
start bargaining with my meals?

419
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,791
So that's it, huh?

420
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,416
Then I guess there's
nothing left to say!

[DRAGGUILDY] Yes! And I'll
risk blowing my cover

00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,041
But you're strong enough
to save this world.

469
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,583
[ULTIROIDS]
Moge!

470
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,000
[TAILBLUE]
What's going on up there?

471
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,500
Is their battle
conjuring up some kind of

472
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,375
twin-tail magic spell?

473
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,666
Watch where you're grabbing
or you're gonna be

474
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,250
pulling back a stump.

475
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,625
Ah. Oh. So that's
what you're after.

476
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,375
Let go of my hair!

477
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,041
[ULTIROIDS yell]

478
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,916
[TAILBLUE] I've been keeping
these for a long time

479
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,541
and they're only
for one person.

480
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,791
And you'd better appreciate
it, you oblivious idiot!

481
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:47,458
You're so trusting.
And careless. And brave.

482
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,750
When you jumped into battle
without hesitating,

483
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,583
I was so proud of you!

484
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,125
I'll stick
with you forever!

485
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,125
[ULTIROIDS yell]

486
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,416
How many are left?

487
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,083
[TWOEARLE]
Exactly 831.

488
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,875
What? Come on!

489
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,125
Break Release!

490
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,166
[ULTIROIDS yell]

491
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,083
Execute Wave!

492
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,833
[groans lightly]

493
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,625
[AIKA] I hope one day
you understand...

494
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,458
..,that I--

495
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,166
[TAILRED grunts]

496
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,708
[DRAGGUILDY] In all my days
I've never seen someone

497
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,208
fight so well.
You are not only

498
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,416
the greatest foe
of my lifetime,

499
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,000
but also the greatest
love I have ever known!

500
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,666
[DRAGGUILDY]
Farewell!

501
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,333
[TAILRED grunts]

502
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,250
[DRAGGUILDY]
What? A second sword?

503
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,458
Well, they don't call us
Twin Tails for nothing,

504
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,750
you know!

505
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,666
[DRAGGUILDY groans]

506
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,000
Brake Release!

507
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,583
[yells]

508
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:06,208
[DRAGGUILDY]
Tailred!

509
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:10,083
[TAILRED]
Grand Blazer!

510
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:15,291
[DRAGGUILDY bellows]

511
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,583
Beautiful.
Truly divine tresses.

512
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,041
A heavenly hairstyle.

513
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,583
Was the first sword
just a decoy?

514
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,791
[TAILRED]
No. Not at all.

515
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,500
I didn't think about it
until I realized

516
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,166
that I was defending
two other people.

517
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,291
So it seemed only natural
that I would need two swords.

518
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,000
[DRAGGUILDY]
Well played, Tailred.

519
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,500
I am honored
to have been defeated

520
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,958
by such a beautiful
twin-tailed girl.

521
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,750
I can say
without a doubt,

522
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,875
this is how my life
was always meant to end.

523
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,458
Just how positive
can one guy be?

524
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,125
[DRAGGUILDY]
May we meet again, someday!

525
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,333
[groans]

526
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,708
As long as you have
love in your heart

527
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:58,375
for twin-tails, there's
a chance that will happen.

528
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,500
[gasps]

529
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:04,958
It's over now, huh?

530
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:08,375
That's great.
Maybe... I'll just...

531
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,750
[BOTH gasp]

532
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:17,083
Heck of a day.
Huh, Twin Tails?

533
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,333
[AIKA]
Soji. I can't believe it.

534
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,958
We finally had our first
real joint operation!

535
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,875
[SOJI] "Joint operation"?
More like "fight."

536
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:56,166
[TWOEARLE] Well, well,
well, Miss Aika,

537
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,375
aren't you desperate?

538
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:58,625
[AIKA] Shut up! At least
when we're out there

539
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:00,666
fighting you won't be
able to get in my way.

540
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,250
Then I'll have
plenty of chances to--

541
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,666
Wait, who is that?

542
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,208
A third member
of the Twin Tails?

543
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:06,625
[TWOEARLE] Yep!
And unlike someone I know,

544
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:08,083
she's got some hefty hooters!

545
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,958
[AIKA] Oh, don't be immature!
Just say she's busty!

546
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:13,375
[SOJI] Next time:
"The Third Twin Tail"!

547
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,416
[AIKA]
Tail On!
