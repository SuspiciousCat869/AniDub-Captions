guarded by Tail Gear,

312
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,916
so you're gonna have to be
more careful from now on.

313
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,291
Yeah, I'm sorry. You're right.

[grunts]

315
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,166
[AIKA] Don't be sorry,
there's no crime in not knowing.

316
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,458
Up until now, you've gotten
a perfect set of twin-tails

317
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,791
just by transforming
and saying "tail on".

318
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,833
[SOLAR] I guess I never
realized how much work

319
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:39,041
went into maintaining
twin-tails. Wow.

320
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,125
I suppose, in the end, I didn't
know as much about them

321
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,041
as I thought I did, huh?

322
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,958
I'm gonna tie up your hair now.

323
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,291
I'm gonna use the same
rubber bands that I use.

324
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,916
[gasps]

325
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,291
[AIKA]
What are those?

326
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,375
Oh, these are the barrettes
that I used to wear,

327
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,958
back when I was still
wearing twin-tails.

328

[gasps]

329
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,041
And, since I have no
use for them anymore,

330
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,416
I thought that Mr. Soji
could use them.

331
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,041
Then I'll tie them up,
in your honor.

332
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,000
Thank you. That's
very nice, Twoearle.

For the rest of our years,

00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,708
we will never get to
see his slimy smile,

343
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,500
nor that adorable, wriggly
way he moved, ever again.

350
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,833
at the same arena where Worm
Guildy appeared yesterday!

351

It's the middle of the night.

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,125
There isn't even
anyone there right now.

What could they be thinking?

354
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,541
[TWOEARLE]
Mr. Soji, are you okay?

355
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:24,125
Uhh. It's nothing, I'm just a
little off my game today is all.

356
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:27,291
I'm on my way! Let Aika

I am the great Snail Guildy!

You should know that my love for
Worm Guildy was second to none!

You'll pay for

a lot better than that.

That has to be it! Ever since
her lips touched mine,

00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,750
twin-tails are
taking a back seat

obsession with girls!

have to worry, Mr. Soji!

At least you have that
to look forward to, right?

Your chief officer?
